  [Text] The Ukrainian Central Electoral Commission is still 
counting the results of the elections held on Sunday [26 June]. 
However, officials in Kiev are by now convinced that Leonid 
Kravchuk is in the lead in the vote count. INTERFAX has learned 
this from the head of the Ukrainian president's information 
service, Vladimir Shlyaposhnikov. 
  Unofficial data for 1000 today, as received by INTERFAX, 
show 
that the gap between the present head of state and his main 
rival in the elections, Leonid Kuchma, is about two million 
votes. The situation is as yet unclear only in Donetsk and 
Ivano-Frankovsk oblasts.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F>
Andrey Sitov] 
  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- Present-day Sino-Russian 
cooperation should also cover military technology, Sergey 
Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on Defence, told 
ITAR-TASS. 
  "All basic types of Chinese armaments are virtiually the 
same 
which the Soviet Army relied upon. China, it seems, is 
interested in our weapons by virtue of the established 
conditions. I do not see any reasons that would preclude at 
least the maintenance of the level which has been achieved in 
this respect," Yushenkov said. 
  "The United States has renounced a ban on the granting of 
the 
most-favoured-nation trading status to China. Why should Russia 
keep aloof? If the United States has granted such a status, it 
has serious grounds to draw conclusions on the state of affairs 
in China. One can cast doubt on the conclusions, of course. 
But this, to my mind, would cost a pretty penny," the 
parliamentarian recalled.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Yermolin: "Budget Law Adopted. Army's </F>
Interests Unaffected"] 
  [Text] It has happened: The State Duma has adopted the 
Law on the Federal Budget for 1994 in its entirety. In the 
section which concerns us, the military, it can be said that 
nothing has changed. In point of fact, the debate over defense 
expenditure was closed back at the second reading. But certain 
details will probably be of interest to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's 
readers. 
  Individually, the results of the vote were as follows: 278 
for, 80 against, with eight abstentions; 89 deputies did not 
vote [figures as published do not correspond with referent 
item]. By comparison with the second reading the number who 
said "no" to this budget doubled. Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of 
the State Duma Defense Committee, explained to me that "the 
abstentions and nonvotes are also votes against. That is how we 
will look at it. In total 177 did not agree with the government 
distribution of expenditure and revenue (and therefore with the 
reduced defense budget)." 
  As for the vote by factions, 81.8 percent of the Russian 
Agrarian Party, 0 percent of "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy Bloc], 64.1 
percent of "Russia's Choice," 73.3 percent of the Democratic 
Party of Russia, 10.9 percent of the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia, 79.3 percent of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord], 90.9 percent of "Women of Russia," 73.1 percent of "New 
Regional Policy," and 56.2 percents of deputies not belonging to 
factions voted for the budget. 
  By comparison with the second reading (compare the 
publication of the results of individual voting in KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA for 16 June) Zhirinovskiy's party has radically changed 
its stance -- the majority of those who voted for the budget at 
the second reading today voted against. 
  Sergey Yushenkov told me that in conversation with him 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin had confirmed his recent press 
conference statement that the Army will be financially "topped 
up" from extrabudgetary funds. The only issue now is to ensure 
that the money is transferred from the Ministry of Finances to 
the Ministry of Defense promptly and under the requisite 
controls.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Dorofeyev: "Duma Has Its Own Thoughts on </F>
Crime"] 
  [Text] The fact that a wave of crime is lashing Russia 
today is obvious to everyone. Criminal terror, even if it is 
not aimed at a specific person, can affect anyone with a stray 
bullet or shock wave. 
  The crime situation has reached a dangerous limit which 
requires urgent measures to be taken. Russian Federation 
President Boris Yeltsin offered his vision for a way out of the 
crime crisis in his 14 June edict "on urgent measures to protect 
the population against gangsterism and other manifestations of 
organized crime." We shall not recount its content, it is 
known. But it is no secret either that this edict has generated 
a far from homogenous reaction among Russia's political circles. 
Virtually all factions of the State Duma unanimously denounced 
the president's scenario for urgent measures to fight crime. 
Why? Here are the opinions of representatives of various 
factions and deputies' groups. 
  "It seems to me," believes V. Sheynis ("Russia's Choice") 
"that there is a very dangerous game involving political slogans 
under way. Both the president's team and the State Duma members 
are taking part in it. The situation which is taking shape 
around the struggle against crime is reminiscent of the one 
which occurred last summer with the sovereignization of former 
autonomous regions. At the time both the president and the 
Supreme Soviet were seeking to win the support of the autonomous 
regions and rushed to surrender their positions quickly. There 
was a game of give-away. 
  "Something similar is happening now. But something more 
dangerous. Indeed, the situation regarding the rampage of crime 
perturbs and affects everyone. But how to fight it? Through 
fly-swatting, that is by adopting widely publicized acts, 
including acts connected with the violation of constitutionally 
guaranteed human rights, or by waging a hard struggle against 
crime? 
  "The main problem here is by no means the lack of a 
legislative base, as many people believe. Even the base which 
exists is adequate. That the organs which must engage in this 
and their cadres, orientation, and conduct are not appropriate 
to the situation which has now taken shape is another matter. 
In my view that is the main problem where the main efforts 
should be made. 
  "As for the president's edict itself, it would be far more 
appropriate for it to be submitted to the duma as a draft law." 
  The viewpoint of A. Lezdinsh ("12 December" deputies' group) 
is virtually the same as what V. Sheynis said. He also believes 
that with the existing legislative base the law enforcement 
organs are quite able to struggle against organized crime. 
Especially since as a result of protracted talks on this 
subject the technical equipping and quantitative composition of 
the internal affairs organs staffers has nonetheless increased. 
The edict signed by the president, in A. Lezdinsh's opinion, if 
it is fulfilled will return Russia to a time over 50 years ago, 
to an era when the qualitative borders between legality and 
tyranny were eroded. 
  The edict, A. Lezdinsh believes, will not lead to the 
stepping up of the struggle against crime but on the contrary 
could very well serve as the fuse for large-scale conflicts with 
the participation of large groups of the population. And at the 
same time a lever to the transfer of the state's management to a 
totalitarian regime. This edict, the deputy believes, must be 
repealed as regards the section which contradicts the 
Constitution and we must return to the package of draft laws on 
the struggle against crime which the president and government 
promised three months ago to submit to the Duma. 
  While in no way casting doubt on the right of the country's 
president to issue edicts regulating relations in society, V. 
Zorkaltsev (Russian Federation Communist Party faction) also 
voiced his negative attitude toward the question. The document, 
which affects the interests of the overwhelming majority of 
people and makes it possible to defend their interests by 
invading their private lives must be drawn up only in the form 
of a law, whose draft could very well be submitted by the 
president. Provisions like detention for 30 days, the checking 
of private accounts, the virtual abolition of concepts like 
commercial and banking secrets -- this is all absolutely 
intolerable. Unfortunately the edict does not even provide for 
measures of liability for militia staffers for the actions they 
perform. 
  But there is one phenomenon which already as it were stands 
outside the framework of this edict and which cannot fail to 
alarm us. I am sure, V. Zorkaltsev believes, that it was 
received with approval by the overwhelming mass of Russians. 
But you only have to recall a newsreel of the thirties. In 
that newsreel citizens were also going to show trials carrying 
placards reading "Shoot the enemies of the people!" They walked 
with confidence. This situation must not be repeated today. 
Because in the ordinary people's consciousness the idea still 
lives that the only important thing is for order to be 
introduced, even if it is with an "iron hand." But that "order" 
will be a screen for settling accounts and winning political 
stability, the deputy is convinced. Because what is needed is 
not en edict but a law on the struggle against crime adopted by 
the Duma, approved by the Federation Council, and signed by the 
president, he believes. 
  V. Isakov (Russian Agrarian Party) is now less sharp in his 
description of this Russian president's edict. He believes that 
this document abolishes fundamental guarantees of law and order 
and legality stating that citizens' rights and freedoms can be 
restricted only by the law. The very fact of the edict's 
publication violates the norms of the Constitution and of the 
criminal procedure code. 
  It is not even a case of how serious the restrictions 
envisaged by the edict are, the deputy believes. Ultimately the 
supreme measure is not envisaged in them. But the very fact 
that the president is invading this sphere is evidence that he 
may reach it in the future since the norms and restrictions 
envisaged by the Constitution no longer exist. 
  To a lawyer it is obvious, V. Isakov continues, that the 
edict has no mechanism of implementation. The constitutional 
principle of the law's supremacy has not been repealed by 
anyone. And in court, when a law and an edict clash, lawyers 
will be obliged to apply the law. Thus the result of the edict 
is in fact not to step up the struggle against crime but to 
weaken and disorganize that struggle. 
  The deputy is convinced that the struggle against crime must 
be waged on the basis of the existing legislative system. 
Undoubtedly, by improving it, in the sphere of monitoring 
incomes, for instance, and of the liability of state employees 
and special protection for witnesses.... 
  Actually, there are also different viewpoints in the Duma. 
In the opinion of Democratic Party of Russia leader N. Travkin 
we can no longer deal with crime by civilized methods and we 
must not argue with the edict but rapidly adopt laws which make 
it possible to wage a real struggle against crime. Deputy V. 
Lipitskiy also advocates extraordinary measures, believing that 
the president's edict has merely defined measures which the Duma 
should have adopted.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Increasing the Minimum Wage"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The federal law on increasing 
the minimum wage, adopted by the State Duma, was yesterday 
approved by the Federation Council and should come into force 1 
July. As is well known, the minimum wage is increased by 40 
percent on that day -- that is, from 14,620 rubles [R] to 
R20,500 a month. 
  At the same time, deputies instructed the Committee for 
Social Policy to work out with each region within two weeks the 
question of the source of funding for the increased wage, so as 
to ensure that this decision, which the people need so much, 
does not remain an empty intention. 
  The upper house also approved the federal law on amendments 
and additions to the RSFSR Criminal Code and Code of Criminal 
Procedure, which had been sent to it by the State Duma. The law 
"On the Russian Federation's State Foreign Borrowings and State 
Loans Granted by the Russian Federation to Foreign States" was 
also approved. 
  The Federation Council yesterday adopted an appeal to the 
CSCE parliaments in connection with the Latvian Saeima's 
adoption of a citizenship law. 
  The document notes that this law was adopted "despite 
numerous protests from the international community and 
regardless of the recommendations made by the CSCE, the Council 
of Europe, and a number of international experts." Thus, the 
Latvian authorities have "ignored generally accepted standards 
in the human rights sphere," the appeal notes. 
  The Federation Council called on them to "uphold the 
principles of humanism that are being asserted in Europe, to 
prevent Latvia from sliding into aggressive nationalism, and to 
avert the emergence of a seat of tension in the Baltic region."

  [Text] The Federation Council committee for agrarian policy 
has described the situation in the Russian agro-industrial 
complex in 1994 as extreme and catastrophic. In its statement 
it forecasts a production slump in agricultural enterprises of 
all types of ownership in 1994. It suggests that compared to 
average annual figures for 1986-90, production will fall by 
between 45 and 50 percent. The committee believes that in those 
conditions emergency economic measures are needed to support the 
agricultural sector.

  [Text] Moscow, 24 June -- Anatoliy Chubays has reacted very 
quickly to deputies' demands in the State Duma today to create a 
solid legal basis for the privatization process. The chairman 
of the state committee for the management of state property sent 
a telegram which was circulated as quickly among the deputies 
during the plenary session. 
  "Taking into consideration the wishes of the deputies and on 
the basis of the presidential resolution of 10 June 1994, I 
think it would be expedient for the government to submit for the 
State Duma's consideration the bill "On the state program of 
privatization of state and municipal enterprises," Anatoliy 
Chubays wrote. He told the parliamentarians that the state 
committee for the management of state property had already 
prepared such a bill and it could be submitted to the State Duma 
immediately after Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's return 
from his foreign business trip on 25 June.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- Pavel Medvedev, chairman of 
the Russian State Duma sub-committee for banking legislation, 
admitted on Monday that perhaps foreign banks should be allowed 
limited operations on Russian territory. 
  "In that question we, as legislators, have no disagreements 
with the Central Bank's position", he announced at a 
press-conference held in the Duma. Medvedev explained that 
limited penetration of the Russian financial market by foreign 
banks "would help our banking system to become more stable and 
civilized". 
  The sub-committee head showed reporters the draft of a new 
edition of the acting law "On Banks and Banking Activity". The 
sub- committee hopes to submit the new draft to the full chamber 
for its first reading at the beginning of this June. 
  Medvedev stressed that the changes to the law are designed 
to 
eliminate the contradictions which industrialists and financiers 
now constantly encounter in the banking business. In 
particular, banks will be required to offer clients full 
information, which is often not done now, since the law on that 
topic is not fully clear. "Therefore, the banking system will 
become more transparent", he explained. 
  Commenting on the fact that there are a significant number 
of 
organisations in Russia who are carrying out banking operations 
without the appropriate license to do so, Medvedev reported that 
the new version of the banking law contains an amendment which 
would protect depositors' savings and clearly indicate which 
banks have the necessary licenses and what will happen to those 
banks which ignore the law. The chairman said that the Russian 
Government's decision to tax the interest which citizen's 
receive on their bank deposits was "politically shortsighted". 
  Medvedev also underlined that the new version of the banking 
law included provisions to make money-laundering more difficult 
and establish stricter control over the origin of funds which 
are deposited in banks. In accordance with these goals, some 
depositors will have to submit declarations proving that the 
money they would like to deposit is really their own.

  [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an 
article headlined "The privatisation cheque is going. What 
remains?" in view of the cheque phase of privatisation ending on 
Thursday. 
  Giving the Russian property committee's positive appraisal 
of 
the privatisation phase, the newspaper points out at the same 
time that the evaluation is "in sharp contrast" to other points 
of view. Generalising them, the newspaper writes that 
privatisation "has not brought the expected results either for 
the work collectives, the state or main social groups of the 
population". 
  Referring to extreme estimates, the newspaper notes that 
only 
"a comparatively small group of corrupt officials and members of 
shadow-economy and criminal outfits closely connected with them" 
benefitted from it. 
  Nevertheless, the newspaper favours taking into 
consideration 
a "more weighed conclusion: the qualitative (or formal) results 
of the privatisation are impressive. The privatisation cheques, 
while not resolving many problems, still substantially promoted 
the formation of a stock market". Although a widely 
representative class of genuine proprietors has not yet emerged, 
"privatisation has expedited the formation of a market 
mechanism". 
  PRAVDA runs a report, headlined "The Moscow voucher 
(privatisation cheque) will die somewhat later", on a Moscow 
government decision to extend the privatisation period in the 
country's capital until January 1, next year. 
  At the same time the newspaper maintains that "136,000 
privatisation unclaimed by Muscovites will be used for the 
purpose of providing the social protection of citizens. 
[sentence as recieved] Besides, another two to four million 
privatisation cheques are kept by Muscovites who could not 
decide where to invest them. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports Tuesday's meeting between 
Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and foreign companies' executives whom 
he assured that "a favourable investment climate has taken shape 
in Russia". The newspaper quotes him as saying that the notion 
of Russia as a country with a high degree of political risk "has 
already become out-of-date". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) summarises remarks by President 
Yeltsin, supreme commander-in-chief of the Russian Armed Forces, 
and Defence Minister Pavel Grachev at a reception of military 
academies' graduates in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses on 
Tuesday. The newspaper points out that more than 7,000 young 
officers will join the Russian Army and Navy. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, runs a report under the headline "From now 
on Russia and NATO headquarters will maintain friendly 
relations", on Defence Minister Pavel Grachev's Tuesday meeting 
with visiting General George Joulwan, NATO Supreme Allied 
Commander, Europe, and an accord reached that the Russian 
Defence Ministry will open a permanent mission at the NATO 
allied headquarters soon and NATO will send its representatives 
to the Russian Defence Ministry. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with General of the 
Army 
Makhmut Gareyev, Dr. of military sciences, the author of a 
number of books and 200 scientific articles conveying his views 
about nuclear weapons and their place in ensuring Russia's 
military security. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports that 3,000 children from the 
Chernobyl disaster-affected areas left by air for Denmark and 
Norway for medical treatment last Sunday. The report is 
headlined "The first Russian landing party at a NATO airfield". 
  Although more than eight years have passed since the tragedy 
at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, "children are born and 
grow up in contaminated areas in Bryansk, Tula, Kursk and other 
regions. Chernobyl kids have in their organisms the radioactive 
legacy of 1986". 
  The press highlights materials concerning Russian-Indian 
relations and the forthcoming official visit of Indian Prime 
Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. The visit begins on Wednesday. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI and NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carry Rao's 
interviews in which he points that despite the changes which 
have taken place in the two countries in recent years, "the 
traditionally close friendship between India and Russia remains 
unchanged." India seeks to revitalise traditional contacts with 
Russia, the Indian prime minister emphasised. 
  TRUD on the presidential election in Ukraine: 
  The postponement for almost 24 hours of the Central 
Electoral 
Commission's official communique, announcing whom the electorate 
preferred out of seven contenders for the presidency, is 
indicative of a "rather acute and uncompromising struggle 
between candidates and between their supporters". As a result 
of the first round of elections, the Ukraine's incumbent 
President Leonid Kravchuk is ahead of ex-premier Leonid Kuchma. 
  PRAVDA carries an interview with prominent scientist 
Vladimir 
Gorshenin who voiced the conviction that the Soviet Union would 
re- emerge but in a different form, of course. A reunification 
of our peoples is "the primary condition for independence. 
Almost everyone has already come to realise that..." Gorshenin 
said.

  [Text] The Russian acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin 
has told Interfax that his ministry has submitted a draft law to 
the government on forming a special budget fund to finance the 
federal anti-crime program. 
  Dubinin said the fund should be formed in two ways. Firstly, 
a special account should be opened for voluntary donations. The 
other part of the fund could be formed with the help of an 
additional income tax. The suggestion is: incomes under 75,000 
rubles a month would be tax-exempt. Between 75,000 and 300,000 
rubles the rate would be 0.5 pct, between 300,000 and one 
million -- 1 pct, between one and two and a half million -- 2 
pct, and over 2.5 million -- 3 pct. 
  Dubinin believes the tax would help collect 700 billion in 
half a year which is the sum necessary for financing the federal 
program according to ministry estimates. 
  "I do not know how pleasant that is politically, but if we 
approve a program and intend to carry it out, it should be 
financed and we do not have additional sources in the framework 
of the approved budget," the acting minister admitted. Thus, an 
additional, alternative source has to be found: these could be 
special bonds totalling 700 billion or one trillion rubles, 
Dubinin said. 
  Dubinin added that bonds could be distributed among legal 
entities and individuals on a voluntary basis. In any case 
without defining the source it is impossible to finance the 
program, therefore something has to be chosen, Dubinin said. 
  He added that the ministry does not fear to be sharply 
criticized for the proposed tax because it already is a target 
of constant attacks. Dubinin said that the proposal is being 
made at a time when the ministry intends to reduce the rates of 
several other taxes. 
  "I think this will be understood properly. I am ready to pay 
for my personal security. I might not be right, but I think 
that the majority of the population will understand", he 
concluded.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Korupayeva under the "Edict Adopted. </F>
What Now?" rubric: "Will We Be Able To Halt the Crime Wave?"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation president's edict "On Urgent 
Measures To Protect the Population from Banditry and Other 
Manifestations of Organized Crime" came into force yesterday. 
We continue the discussion of the merits and shortcomings of 
this document. 
  ...On 13 May this year, in the village of Slobodka in Moscow 
Oblast's Klinskiy Rayon, staffers of the regional administration 
for combating organized crime "took" an armed gang. The 
criminals had brutally killed Militia Captain A. Grushevskiy. 
But first they had tortured him: There were 21 knife wounds on 
the captain's body, and they had drowned and burned him.... For 
what? They had demanded that he cooperate with an organized 
criminal grouping. 
  It is said that when they "took" the criminals, the 
residents 
of Klin yelled: "Kill them!" But not a mark was left on the 
bandits' corpulent bodies, so professionally were they detained. 
  Unfair? Yes. But staffers of law enforcement organs are not 
bandits.... The "work" methods (forgive the comparison) are 
different. One group has the law at their disposal, albeit a 
bad law, while the others are bloody inhuman people. Human life 
is nothing to them. It is against them that the Russian 
president's edict "On Urgent Measures To Protect the Population 
from Banditry and Other Manifestations of Organized Crime" must 
work. 
  Militia Colonel General Mikhail Yegorov, Russian Federation 
first deputy minister of internal affairs and chief of the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs Main Organized 
Crime Administration, has expressed his position on the edict's 
application. 
  In his opinion, the rejection of this edict by many 
officials 
and politicians is attributable to the fact that they themselves 
are businessmen and it is not to their advantage for law 
enforcement organs to gain access to commercial information or, 
more importantly, to be able to follow the tortuous paths along 
which their money proceeds. 
  As M. Yegorov pointed out, today there are more than 200 
well 
organized and armed-to-the-teeth criminal groupings operating in 
Moscow alone. 
  Every month criminal groupings in Russia commit 
1,500 crimes. More than 700 firearms are regularly confiscated 
from them, as well as material assets and money to the value of 
over 5 billion rubles. Every month. 
  Over the past 18 months alone proceedings have been 
instituted in 46 criminal cases connected with contract 
killings, which today have become the most effective means of 
eliminating the "enemy." 
  Corruption and organized crime in close tandem have 
penetrated all spheres of state management. 
  During 1993 alone the militia got rid of over 500 
operational 
workers who had cooperated (sold operational information!) with 
criminal groupings. There were also ones who "did" "wet" jobs 
together with bandits. Criminal proceedings were instituted 
against them, and they were dismissed from internal affairs 
organs. Several high-ranking officials were arrested in 
Vladimir Oblast, in Komi.... 
  An analysis of the courts' verdicts in such a category of 
criminal cases as bribes is interesting. Last year 843 
officials were convicted of this. 
  Roughly the same verdicts are passed for illegal gun 
running. 
Just 19 percent of criminals convicted under Article 218 of the 
Russian Federation Criminal Code are in jail. And the rest? 
Some are dead, some are far distant.... 
  But the ones who really are "far distant" today are the 
leaders of criminal groupings released on bail [pod zalog] from 
Moscow Oblast courtrooms. Seventeen thugs safe and sound! 
  The dynamics of the growth in people released on bail 
[zalozhniki] is staggering. On 23 June 1991 there were two of 
them in Moscow. There were five on the same day in 1992, 16 in 
1993, and 118 in 1994. This in Moscow alone! 
  According to recent data obtained from foreign law 
enforcement organs, 24 Russian criminal groupings are working in 
the United States and have a connection with the Cosa Nostra, 
and six go to Italy. Some 100 criminal groupings are oriented 
toward other distant foreign countries, and 200 toward nearby 
foreign countries (the former USSR republics).

  [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- The chiefs of the Russian 
prosecutor-general's office, the Interior Ministry and the 
Federal Counter-Intelligence Service have signed a joint 
instruction about a procedure for the enactment of the 
presidential decree dated June 14 "On urgent measures to protect 
the population from banditry and other manifestations of 
organised crime", spokesmen at the public relations centres of 
the three agencies told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
  The prosecutor's office, internal affairs and 
counter-intelligence agencies have been provided with practical 
elucidations, based on the current legislation, about the decree 
enactment procedure. 
  The document emphasises that "all efforts should be aimed at 
protecting the life and health of citizens, their rights and 
freedoms and at ensuring the realisation of current reforms and 
state security". 
  Joint operational investigation groups are being set up to 
expose gangs and other organised-crime associations. All 
investigation activities are to be conducted under a strict 
procuratorial supervision which will be exercised by personnel 
to be detailed by the prosecutor's offices of all levels. 
  Special attention during operational investigation 
activities 
should be given to obtaining and recording factual data on 
specific criminal activities of suspects. 
  The three public relations centres state that "the enactment 
of the decree is aimed exclusively at putting a stop to the 
activities of dangerous criminals and at ensuring the safety of 
citizens". The public relation centres are to regularly inform 
the population of the outcome of anti-crime efforts.

  [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- The third hostage drama which 
took place in the southern Russian city of Mineralnyye Vody over 
the last six months ended successfully on Wednesday morning and 
was the shortest among the three. 
  Two days after police announced a major crack-down on crime, 
three gunmen seized a bus with some 40 hostages heading for the 
southern city of Stavropol and demanded two helicopters and 5.8 
billion US dollars. 
  The drama began at 16.00 hours Moscow time (13.00 GMT) and 
ended early next morning. 
  The hostage-takers were seized in the rebel Russian republic 
of Chechnya and the ransom retrieved. All hostages were safely 
freed. This was the shortest drama. The first one which took 
place last December 23 continued for four days, the second one 
lasted 24 hours. 
  All the three had practically the same scenario. A bus with 
hostages was seized, terrorists demanded a multi-million dollar 
ransom, guns and drugs and tried to escape on a helicopter 
somewhere in the mountains, preferably in Chechnya where crime 
rate is extremely high. 
  All the three times the terrorists were seized, hostages 
freed and ransom retrieved. 
  It is noteworthy that terrorists are no longer hijacking 
planes abroad as it used to happen in Soviet years, but prefer 
to remain in Russia with huge amounts of hard currency. 
  Russian commandos fighting terrorists had also changed their 
manner of action. In Soviet years they did everything possible 
to prevent a hijacked plane from crossing the border. Thus, 
nine passengers were killed and the plane completely destroyed 
when commandos stormed a hijacked craft in March 1988 which 
landed in St. Petersburg for refuelling. 
  After the tragedy the anti-terrorist groups focused mostly 
on 
saving the lives of hostages rather than seizing terrorists. 
However, this might have made terrorists no longer fear resolute 
actions against them. 
  The three hostage dramas clearly show a new tendency in the 
Russian crime record. It is also evident that the failure of 
terrorists to escape does not stop their successors. Hardly 
anyone can say for sure that the Mineralnyye Vody airport would 
not face yet another hostage drama in future.

  [Text] Members of the Conciliatory Commission for the 
implementation of the Civic Accord Agreement have different 
views on the idea of prolonging the powers of the parliament and 
president, proposed by Federation Council Speaker Vladimir 
Shumeyko. 
  Mayor of St. Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak told the first 
plenary session of the Commission on Tuesday that he viewed this 
measure as an attempt to solve a social problem by violating the 
Civic Accord Agreement. Sobchak was supported by President of 
the Russian Union of Manufacturers and Entrepreneurs Arkadiy 
Volskiy, who proposed that the Commission condemn Shumeyko's 
statement. Volskiy said that Shumeyko's proposal had given rise 
to the movement for recalling the deputies. 
  Vice-Chairman of the Federation Council Ramazan Abdulatipov 
opposes all statements of condemnation because, he said, this 
means a roll-back to the times when the Communist Party 
"condemned all kinds of dissidence." His position was supported 
by chief of the president's staff Sergey Filatov. 
  However, Filatov backed the proposal by representative of 
the 
Liberal-Democratic Party Vishnyakov, who condemned Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev's phrase about the opponents of Russia's 
participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program. In a TV 
interview Kozyrev described them as "red-brown political 
bastards". On Filatov's initiative, the Conciliatory Commission 
instructed Academician Vladimir Kondratyev to draft a statement 
on unparliamentary expressions. "If we are to appease society, 
we must choose expressions which do not discredit state 
leaders," said Filatov. 
  The president's aid Georgiy Satarov told Interfax that 
formally Shumeyko's proposal did not contradict the Civic Accord 
Agreement. This document says that early elections unstipulated 
in the Constitution are inadmissible. "In this particular case, 
the extension of powers after the expiration of the term is 
meant," said Satarov. "Theoretically, such a possibility cannot 
be excluded, but one must seriously assess whether or not to 
make such a step," he said. Whatever the circumstances, the 
final decision is to be taken by the electors, who must state 
their opinion in a referendum, said Satarov.

  [Text] The government's policy is aimed at ruining the 
agro-industrial complex (AIC), it fails to meet the requirements 
of the country's food security and makes Russia dependent on 
industrialized countries in the future, the agrarian policies 
committee of the Council of the Federation has said in a 
"Political Statement" sent to the mass media. 
  Agrarian members of parliament described the situation in 
the 
AIC as catastrophic and requiring urgent economic measures. For 
instance, farm produce this year will decline 45-50 percent 
against the average level of 1986-1990. Gross grain production 
is estimated at no more than 80 million tonnes (as compared with 
99 million in 1993 and 106.8 million in 1992). In livestock 
farming the number of cows is down to the level of 1970, and 
sheep, at the 1952 level. 
  The statement dwells at length on the falling production in 
farm machine turn-out, the curtailed social programs in rural 
areas and other negative effects of reforms in the AIC. 
  The committee demands budgetary allocations for the agrarian 
sector in 1994 in keeping with the government's resolution of 
February 23, 1994 as well as protectionist measures. 
  A member of the committee's technical staff told Interfax on 
the condition of anonymity that none of the committee's leaders 
had been invited to the meetings of agrarians with President 
Yeltsin on June 27.

<F P=106> [Olga Garbuzova report: "Agrarian Party Holds News </F>
Conference. Agrarians Have Taken President at his Word One Last 
Time"] 
  [Text] At yesterday's news conference, leaders of the 
Russian Agrarian Party faction shared with journalists their 
impressions about their earlier meeting with the president. 
Pointing out that the conversation was constructive, the 
representatives of the agro- industrial sector said at the same 
time that it was the last time they believed Boris Yeltsin's 
intention to change his methods of agricultural reform. 
  Although, the participants in the meeting themselves said, 
the president kept mostly silent and the agrarians mostly 
complained, the latter presumed after the conversation that the 
president is ready to change the methods of reforming 
agriculture. The promise of regular meetings with the president 
inspired optimism among the agrarians: in their view, this will 
help the president get an idea about the situation in the 
agriculture. For the time being, however, Deputy Vasiliy 
Vershinin said, "the president has a distorted idea of it and 
believes that things are going pretty well." The agrarians 
tried to change this view and thought the conversation with 
Yeltsin was constructive. According to Deputy Aleksandr 
Davydov, "we do not expect revolutionary changes from these 
meetings, but we hope that some mistakes made during economic 
reform will be corrected." 
  Their hopes are scarcely justified, however -- according to 
reports by the presidential press service, the agrarians were 
promised that reform in the countryside will proceed within the 
framework of the general reform strategy. It is hard to see in 
these words a readiness to change the course of agricultural 
reform, but the deputies saw just that. Moreover, participants 
in the news conference said that it was the last time they took 
the president at his word. They could not coherently explain, 
however, what they would do if the president fails to deliver. 
Obviously, the agrarians cannot do anything more menacing than 
stage a token Day of Peasants' Protest, which was organized last 
summer and failed to have any significant impact on the 
government. Undoubtedly, the authorities would like to see the 
Agrarian Party sign the Treaty on Public Accord, but the defiant 
agrarians said in the news conference that they are not going to 
do so. Evidently, so intransigent a stance will further weaken 
the authorities' desire to meet the agrarians halfway.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Popov report: "The Federal Counterintelligence </F>
Service Changes Premises"] 
  [Text] As your correspondent has learned from an informed 
source, the nation's pride -- the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service [FCS] -- is changing its "haunts." Its Material and 
Technical Department, hitherto located at the metropolitan Pekin 
Hotel, seems to have been plagued by...cockroaches, mice, and 
other rodents which have proliferated in great numbers. The FCS 
is no less concerned about the deplorable physical condition of 
the "guest house:" In many places the peeling plaster threatens 
to fall right onto one's head. Aware of their responsibility 
for the Motherland, the management of the famous hotel decided 
to close down for a major renovation and sanitation cleaning. 
Therefore the FCS had to look for a new place. 
  This time the intelligence people took a liking to the Mir 
hotel [across from the U.S. Embassy] where not an extra speck of 
dust can be found, let alone cockroaches! The conclusion of a 
secret 10-year leasing agreement is in the final stages, whereby 
the FCS Material and Technical Department will have eight floors 
in the Mir -- from the fourth to the 11th.

  [Text] The political council of Russia's Democratic Choice 
party led by Yegor Gaydar declared on Monday that it is going to 
urge President Boris Yeltsin to dismiss the Director of the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey Stepashin, if the 
latter refuses to disavow his statement that he is "for the 
violation of human rights, if the person in question is a 
gangster or a criminal." 
  The chief of the public relations center of the service 
Aleksandr Mikhailov said that when Stepashin spoke of the 
violation of human rights at a conference at the office of the 
Prosecutor General on June 23 he meant the violation of the 
right "to kill, rob and rape" assumed by criminals. 
  According to Mikhailov, the attitude of Stepashin who was 
the 
head of a parliamentary committee investigating KGB activities 
in 1991 is clear and definite: To combat crime a solid legal 
basis should be built and law enforcement bodies should act 
accordingly. The head of the PR center said that in implementing 
the presidential decree counterintelligence intends to base its 
actions on such legal grounds.

  [Text] Russia's Democratic Choice leaders' plans to remove 
Director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS) Sergey 
Stepashin from office is "yet another attempt to play the 
political card and distract the attention of the public from the 
president's efforts to combat crime," FCS spokesman Aleksandr 
Mikhailov told INTERFAX on Tuesday. 
  The party's political council, led by Yegor Gaydar, 
announced 
that it would insist on the resignation of Stepashin if the 
latter did not distance himself from the earlier made statement 
that he was in favor of violating the rights of the individual, 
if this individual is a criminal. 
  Mikhailov said that by making such a statement during the 
enlarged session of the Collegium of the Prosecutor-General's 
Office on June 23, Stepashin meant the right "to kill, rob and 
rape", appropriated by criminals. 
  He also said that Stepashin, the chairman of the former 
parliamentary committee for investigating the activities of the 
KGB, had a clear position: the campaign to combat crime must be 
put on a solid legal footing. The counterintelligence personnel 
intend to act in strict accordance with legal acts while 
implementation the presidential decree on combating organized 
crime, said Mikhailov. 
  He said the people who are trying to play the FCS card once 
again must not forget President Yeltsin's statement that "a 
strong Russia needs strong special services."

  [Text] Legal proceedings against the leader of Russia's 
Democratic Choice, Yegor Gaydar, on charges of slander planned 
for June 29 failed to take place because Gaydar's representative 
failed to appear in court. The appeal was initiated by leader 
of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy. Legal proceedings will be held on July 7, the 
court decided. 
  Gaydar's representative, his lawyer Genri Reznik sent a 
notification to the court saying that he was overloaded with 
current affairs, that he had to go on a trip on business and 
that he would go on holiday from July 26. Reznik asked to 
postpone the proceedings and demanded that they be held not 
earlier than September 10. 
  Zhirinovskiy initiated an appeal against Gaydar after Gaydar 
published the article "A Stake on Villains" in the IZVESTIYA 
newspaper. In the article Gaydar called Zhirinovskiy a "fascist 
populist."

<F P=106> [Article by Yegor Gaydar, leader of "Russia's Democratic </F>
Choice" party: "We Are Not Building Paradise -- We Are Trying 
To Build a Normal Life"] 
  [Text] The first congress of our party, "Russia's 
Democratic Choice," was held 12 June. Why are we creating it? 
Why have I, who am not overfond of "party building," considered 
it my current duty to spend all my efforts and time on creating 
the party? 
  To avoid getting bogged down in details and in order to 
highlight the main points, I offer an initial perspective. 
Let's imagine that we -- like Solzhenitsyn and his family, for 
instance -- have not been in Russia for 20 years and have now 
returned. We were expelled from the USSR in 1974 and we are 
returning to Russia in 1994 and traveling from the East to 
Moscow. 
  I think that as conscientious people we will single out 
several main features characterizing Russian life today. 
  The nauseating, decaying system of state hypocrisy has 
disappeared. It is a case not only of freedom of speech, 
political freedoms, and so forth. The newspapers and television 
are not filled solely with politics. For all their shortcomings 
-- persistent and crude advertizing and other unpleasant 
elements -- people nonetheless see life in the mirror of the 
mass media. After all, in 1974 what we had was simply a mad 
country. We were told lies to the effect that there were no 
poor people, no crimes, no ecological or other man-made problems 
in the USSR -- there was just shock labor, the issue of orders, 
and a "sense of profound satisfaction." This cardboard lie has 
disappeared -- and it is stupid to argue about whether that is 
good or bad. The new life is real, the former life was 
fictitious. 
  Much else has disappeared with the lies -- party meetings, 
interference in private life by the state, fear of the KGB and 
informers, the constant feeling that "abroad" was some kind of 
sweet "forbidden fruit." The world has been opened up to us 
from all sides. You can go wherever you like as long as you 
have the money, you can get any currency, we have any 
information about other countries, we can watch all their 
movies, buy any of their goods, and so forth. From being a 
camp-country we have become an open country. Once again: There 
is much that we may not like in the outside world and in our own 
country but we can choose, our blindfold has been taken away. 
Our life is not ideal, it may be bad, but it is real, not a 
life made up for us by someone. 
  The lines -- a main feature of the Soviet way of life -- 
have 
disappeared. By Western standards we have a very poor range of 
goods and insane prices. But let's think -- if goods, including 
necessities, have increased in cost so insanely, why are people 
mostly calm, why are there no general strikes, and why -- thank 
god! -- are there no barricades, rebellions, and so forth? Why 
do all the calls of the "intransigent opposition" remain just 
talk, however much they try to provoke the people to violence? 
The answer is obvious. If life had indeed deteriorated 
drastically the country would long ago have been drenched in 
blood. Yes, life is hard, often unfair. But if we compare it 
not with paradise but with what we were used to, the conclusion 
is clear: As a whole we have not started to live worse. An 
apartment, an automobile, and simple respectable clothing and 
food were always almost inaccessible to an honest man while 
thieves -- both state thieves (the nomenklatura) and ordinary 
criminals -- always had all that in abundance. Today life has 
become a little more normal: We no longer have to "chase after" 
things and get them on the black market in humiliating 
circumstances. We "only" have to earn money -- and today that 
is the chief, the only problem of a normal person. 
  That can be put to the credit of "perestroyka" and then the 
reforms. We have stopped standing on our heads -- although, 
alas, we have not yet found our feet. 
  Hence the first aim of our party. It has gathered together 
those who are active builders and supporters of today's hard but 
natural human life. And our first "conservationist" task is to 
prevent a return to the old ways. 
  We also adopt a "conservationist" stance on 
military-strategic questions. 
  In other words, we are opponents of demagogic plans to 
restore the USSR's military-imperial might. Matters can go no 
further than demagoguery here -- in reality Russia has no 
strength for such a resurrection. But this demagoguery itself, 
which distracts people from real tasks, is also very dangerous, 
especially as what are incredible funds for peace time -- over 
20 percent of the budget expenditure goes on the army -- 
continue to be spent to the accompaniment of this demagoguery. 
We are in favor of a relatively small, mobile, combat-capable, 
professional army. Of course such an army will not give us the 
opportunity to maintain superpower ambitions but Russia cannot 
afford them and does not need them. Russia must consciously 
leave the race for a place as a superpower. In fact that is 
what has happened. 
  The same applies to borders. We have the precise borders of 
the Russian republic. Attempts to revise them and to expand 
them can only lead to catastrophe -- you only have to look at 
Karabakh to understand what "territorial disputes" are. The 
USSR cannot be restored -- however badly the CIS republics may 
be living they will not surrender their independence just as 
there is no country in the world which will surrender it 
voluntarily. But for Russia it is not only impossible but 
unnecessary to restore the USSR -- Russia has always been the 
giver to the "fraternal republics" and indeed to other 
"fraternal" regimes -- in Angola, Cuba, and Afghanistan.... 
These are all vestiges of the imperial trumpery which gratify 
some people's vanity but which the country cannot afford today. 
  Normal economic relations with the CIS republics are being 
set up and will develop without solemn oaths -- it is simply 
that they are more interested in this than we are. 
Incidentally, we should not reduce trade problems to interstate 
relations. Enterprises, dealers, and bankers will find for 
themselves and already are finding partners -- we are simply 
doomed to collaborate. But collaborate as equals. We shall not 
sacrifice the interests of Russia, the Russian economy, and 
Russian people to maintain a "single and indivisible" power. 
  The defense of Russians' rights is a special issue. To be 
honest, Russians in Central Asia and the Transcaucasus have 
always been "second-class" people. When -- while we still had a 
united USSR! -- the first pogroms against Russians occurred in 
Dushanbe (1990) Moscow kept silent in fear -- to avoid offending 
the "fraternal republic." The great empire never cared a jot 
for the interests of the individual person and sacrificed them 
for the sake of imperial interests. It is here that Russia must 
display vigor -- only, of course, it must not fuel hysteria, not 
squeal and wave its arms "Zhirinovskiy-style." 
  But the main tasks for which we are creating the party are 
not to preserve what has been achieved but to help advance along 
the path of reforms. 
  The main problems lie in the economic sphere. And it is here 
that the question is being decided of whether Russia will become 
a great power in the modern sense of the world and join the 
ranks of the leading countries or will be a semicolonial country 
with nuclear weapons and a large territory. 
  We have one global economic aim: freeing enterprising people 
from the state's fetters, and then they will raise Russia as 
destroyed Germany, Japan, the previously backward Korea, and 
other countries were raised up after the war. Capitalism is not 
an ideal system, it is simply that nothing better has yet 
developed in the world. Only private interest can be a real 
motivating force of progress. For that we need several 
conditions: We must facilitate and simplify the creation of new 
enterprises, develop a simple and stable taxation policy, where 
possible avoid stifling small enterprises with taxes, promote 
the creation of a normal credit system, and firmly elaborate a 
bankruptcy mechanism. The main thing is political stability, 
when a person knows for sure that the state protects his 
property. These conditions can in general become the point of 
departure for the most mobile section of business -- small 
business. Small enterprises are closest of all to the real 
owner, they are less subject to bureaucracy and react flexibly 
to the market. 
  A more complex issue involves large-scale military 
production. We should not fear the slump which is now taking 
place. In a certain sense this is a correct and inevitable 
process and a necessary element in structural restructuring. 
After all, we can sense for ourselves that production is 
declining but the living standard is not declining with it. 
That means the lion's share of what is no longer being produced 
was not vitally necessary. 
  But something else is also obvious. The decline in 
production has two main negative aspects: 
  Unemployment. Serious in itself when it exceeds a certain 
level, it threatens to cause a mass sociopolitical eruption. 
  The collapse of high-technology production. It threatens to 
relegate Russia to the ranks of the third world countries. 
  Three tasks stem from this: 
  -- Creating new jobs, primarily in the construction sphere. 
The construction of housing, roads, and the entire 
infrastructure is a necessary and very promising business. It 
could quite well draw into its orbit a substantial proportion of 
people who are without work and enterprises which are changing 
their profile. 
  -- A "selective" point-by-point policy for supporting 
promising high-technology production facilities. 
  -- Help for competitive industry. For this we do not need to 
engage in "head-on" protectionism -- that leads only to 
monopolism and the stagnation of production. But we need to do 
everything to encourage (tax benefits, guarantees of 
noncommercial risks, and so forth) the creation of joint 
production facilities and the introduction of modern technology 
into our industry. 
  All this is closely linked with financial policy. The stable 
upsurge of the necessary production facilities and the 
normalization of the economy are impossible under conditions of 
high inflation. Thanks to a reduction in the growth rates of 
the money mass last fall to 10 percent a month by this spring 
inflation had been successfully educed to the same level. But 
that is still a very long way from the financial stabilization 
needed for serious investments in production. 
  Everyone understands that financial discipline is essential. 
Everyone knows that a production slump is inevitable. It is 
obvious to everyone that "growth spots" in the economy are 
connected primarily not with "giants in the desert" but with the 
swarm of small and medium private enterprises. That is the 
theory, common sense, and interest of society and the state. 
Realistic policy is made not so much under the influence of 
these general matters as under the influence of personal and 
group interests. 
  Today's policy is a policy pursued by a bureaucracy in the 
interests of a bureaucracy. Bureaucracy is not a swearword. It 
is a social stratum of managers, primarily economic managers, a 
stratum that is specific and is needed in the country. But 
Russia's trouble has always been that it is not the bureaucracy 
that has worked for the country but the country that has worked 
or the bureaucracy. The officials' interests are the same -- 
controlling the distribution of financial wealth and material 
resources. They will not help all private business -- only 
those businessmen who have become 'theirs,' who have grown akin 
to them, and who give bribes. They will not help renew leader 
cadres at enterprises -- they will not remove themselves! Any 
written law (on bankruptcy, on the sale of lossmaking 
enterprises, and so forth) they will in practice distort in 
their own way. 
  So we see our social and political goal in ensuring that it 
is not bureaucracy but society which becomes the decisive 
political force. There is one path here -- reducing the degree 
of state influence on the economy. Demonopolization and 
privatization should serve this goal. But laws alone are not 
enough here -- what is needed is a strictly oriented political 
will. The will of a party which sets as its task the 
transformation of a bureaucratic society into a civil society. 
  The struggle against bureaucracy is no less important (and 
difficult!) than the struggle against crime. Only by placing 
both under control will we be able to "expand" the social area 
and give breathing space to vigorous, lively people who are the 
only ones on whom we can pin our hopes as builders of the future 
Russia. In just the same way the destruction of the tough 
bureaucratic system will make our society open -- open not to 
the outside world but "internally open," so that a person will 
be able to move far more freely than at present within the 
social area, achieving everything by his own abilities and not 
by bureaucratic connections. That is not only a condition for 
economic progress but exceptionally important of itself -- 
important for the reaction of a more human, humane, and normal 
society.. 
  I have not listed all the party's aims. But the main thing 
is clear: We are in favor of a normal path of development for 
Russia, in favor of private ownership and democracy. We are 
against imperial ambitions: territorial, military, 
bureaucratic, and ideological. They say that today our slogans 
are "unfashionable." Perhaps. But they are based on common 
sense. 
  Hence our methods. The methods of a calm, correct policy. 
We are not building paradise -- we are trying to build a normal 
life. Violence is not our method, and, moreover, we know how 
ineffective it is. At the same time in some situations we 
cannot avoid it -- however sad it may be, I do not dissociate 
myself from the government's 3-4 October actions, I take 
responsibility for them and continue to see no alternative to 
them. Only thus could we trample underfoot the embers of of 
civil war. We are in favor of an open society and an open 
policy, including open, tough, but persuasive and precise 
polemics. I hope no one will accuse either the party or me 
personally of demagoguery and vagueness. 
  We are in favor of a party with clean hands. That is what 
all politicians say, but it seems to me that we have real 
grounds for this. At any rate I do not know which of our active 
workers could has been accused of corruption even once. Those 
democratic politicians whose reputation was not irreproachable 
have left "Russia's Choice" one way or another or initially 
belonged to other parties. On the other hand those who are 
known as decent people who do not chase after money and position 
but on the contrary have been imprisoned for their convictions, 
support our party. Almost all the former dissidents in the 
State Duma belong to the "Russia's Choice" faction. 
  We are not romantics. I can clearly see even the 
psychological portrait of the person to whom our party could be 
close: a sensible man consistent in his convictions, someone 
who does not seek external effect but real results. We are in 
favor of a capitalist Russia but that does not mean that 
entrepreneurs make up the basis of our party. We are glad to 
have them, as we are glad to have workers, private farmers, and 
so forth, but our party will be a party of intelligent people, 
whatever professional or social labor they perform. The party 
of those who think not only of the present but also of the 
future of their children, the future of Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by Yaroslav Shimov: "Gaydar Grants To Take the </F>
Place of Lenin Grants"] 
  [Text] The Higher School of Economics was set up at the 
end of 1992. According to its leaders, this academic 
institution is supposed to become a "nursery for Russia's 
economic elite." But the problems of Russian higher education, 
especially financial, have not bypassed the newly fledged 
"nursery." 
  The "Democratic Choice of Russia" party has decided to give 
some support to the young intellectuals. It has instituted 
grants for Higher School of Economics students -- 15 for 
baccalaureate (first degree) students and 20 for master's degree 
(second degree) students, plus 20 grants worth 180,000 rubles 
each to allow students from other cities to pay for their 
residence in Moscow. It is also proposed to establish a 
permanent grant fund to which entrepreneurs wishing to support 
economics students can contribute funds. 
  Sergey Blagovolin, chairman of the organizing committee of 
the "Democratic Choice of Russia's" Moscow organization, claims 
that the students will receive party grants for success in their 
studies and academic work irrespective of their political views. 
The fact that academics from such different poles as Yegor 
Gaydar and Leonid Abalkin sit on the monitoring council and 
figure among the Higher School of Economics teachers could help 
to guarantee this to a certain extent.

  [Text] Moscow, 29 Jun -- "During this tour I am pursuing 
two main goals: first, to meet villagers and Moscow Oblast 
residents, to get a feel of their everyday lives, as it were, 
and second, to discuss conversion issues with the directors of 
the defense industry." This is how Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, who was visiting the Soyuz Research and Production 
Association, described the purpose of his one-day tour of Moscow 
Oblast. 
  Boris Yeltsin said the Russian economy is stabilizing. He 
corroborated his words by citing the inflation rate, which has 
been maintained at 8-9 percent a month over the past five 
months. Price rises in June were 5.5 percent. Moreover, 
Yeltsin said, the fall in industrial output slowed down in June. 
"The economy is gradually leveling up, and by the end of the 
year we expect to have a stable rate of inflation of 5-6 percent 
a month," he noted. 
  The Russian president believes the "political situation in 
society is stabilizing, and the Treaty on Social Accord is 
really working." In view of this, he called for support for the 
presidential decree on the fight against crime. 
  After examining the products manufactured at the Soyuz 
Research and Production Association, Boris Yeltsin is to visit 
the Nikolo-Ugresh monastery.

  [Excerpts] Boris Yeltsin, who is touring Moscow region, 
today visited the Soyuz Research and Production Association in 
Lyubertsy. During a brief conversation with journalists, the 
president said the political situation has calmed down and is 
gradually returning to normal. The Treaty on Social Accord has 
started to work. 
  Boris Yeltsin thinks it is necessary to focus on 
implementing 
a targeted program for eliminating poverty. The president 
believes the gap between the minimum wage of 20,000 rubles and 
the average wage of 500,000 rubles a month is unacceptable. 
  Boris Yeltsin also said the economic situation in Russia 
will 
stabilize this year. [passage omitted] 
  Answering a question by an INTERFAX correspondent, Boris 
Yeltsin acknowledged that budgetary means for developing the 
defense industry are insufficient. Therefore, nonbudgetary 
means will have to be used.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- One of the main achievements of 
the first six months of 1994 was "demilitarization" of the 
Russian economy, First Deputy Economics Minister Yakov Urinson 
said today in his speech at the sitting of the conciliation 
commission in charge of implementation of the national accord 
treaty. 
  According to Urinson, military orders have declined by 70 
percent and this explains the 25 percent decline in production 
in the past six months. 
  At the same time the minister noted the tendency toward 
lower 
inflation, from 10 percent in February to an estimated 7 percent 
in June. In the same period the number of people living below 
the poverty line decreased by 10 million and the population's 
income in real terms increased by 12 percent. 
  The number of registered unemployed increased by 900,000 to 
the present total of 1.2 million. The actual number of 
unemployed is around 4 million or 6 percent of the working 
population. 
  One of the government's priorities will be to channel the 
funds saved by closing down unprofitable enterprises into areas 
of potential growth, so as to meet its commitments stated in the 
national accord treaty, The second priority is "social support 
for those in need."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Boris Yeltsin: Russians Take a Long </F>
Time Getting Ready, But Then Move Quickly. Meeting Between 
Leaders of Top World Companies and Russian Government Ends in 
Moscow"] 
  [Text] A meeting between Russian Federation President 
Boris Yeltsin and a group of leading foreign entrepreneurs was 
held in the Kremlin yesterday. Russian Federation Premier 
Viktor Chernomyrdin also took part in it. 
  The president's press service reported that Boris Yeltsin 
noted that the widespread opinion among foreign investors that 
Russia is a country with a high level of political risk is 
already outdated. The political situation has stabilized over 
the past few months, which creates a favorable climate for the 
investment process. "Russians take a long time getting ready, 
but then move quickly," Boris Yeltsin stated. "We are ready. 
Now we will move more quickly." 
  Around half of all the edicts on economic reform signed 
since 
23 May this year are devoted to normalizing the production and 
investment processes, the president pointed out. There have 
also been successes in the fight against inflation, and the 
prerequisites for reviving the investment process are in 
evidence. 
  The president supported and made a high assessment of the 
idea of setting up the Russian Federation Government 
Consultative Council on Foreign Investment. 
  The main result of the Moscow meeting between the top 
leaders 
of world companies and the Russian Government has been the 
setting up of the Consultative Council on Foreign Investment in 
Russia, Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
stated. He was speaking yesterday at a press conference devoted 
to the conclusion of the two-day sessions the the President 
Hotel, during which Russian ministers and the top leaders of 14 
multinational corporations and banks from the Western countries 
and Japan conducted a direct dialogue on the problems of capital 
investment in the Russian economy. 
  Summing up the meeting's results, Viktor Chernomyrdin 
announced that henceforth the government will resolve questions 
of improving Russian legislation in the sphere of investment, 
changes to the tax system, and, in general, the formation of 
economic and legal conditions to encourage investors in 
conjunction with its Western partners. "A qualitatively new 
structure has emerged," Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed -- "the 
Consultative Council on Foreign Investment, which represents the 
`organized interest' of major foreign investors implementing 
their plans in the Russian business sphere and moving toward a 
free market." 
  The Russian Government is already proposing dozens of ready 
projects in heavy and light industry, and in conversion sectors, 
but these are hard to implement owing to the disorganized state 
of legislative and fiscal mechanisms, the Russian prime minister 
stressed. As he put it, the participants in the President Hotel 
meeting put forward a lot of fair criticism of the vague nature 
of Russian normative acts and the inconsistency of their 
implementation and of the lack of coordination between the 
actions of federal and local authorities. We will strengthen 
executive discipline at all levels of Russian power and we 
guarantee to Western investors that all acts of legislation in 
the foreign investment sphere will be observed, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin stated. The activity of the three standing working 
groups that have been set up will be devoted to solving specific 
problems, he said. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin particularly stressed that foreign 
investment makes it possible to prevent unemployment from 
"sweeping" Russia as a result of bankruptcies and the 
liquidation of loss-making enterprises. By investing capital, 
investors primarily create jobs. 
  The participants in the President Hotel meeting made a high 
assessment of the level of interest and openness shown during 
the meeting, the joint communique on the results of the sessions 
says. They expressed confidence that the active participation of 
all council members in its work will be the guarantee that 
Western capital's participation in developing the Russian 
economy will be galvanized. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
will coordinate the activity of the Council on Foreign 
Investment. Its next session will be held sometime this 
November.

  [Text] Only the foreign banks that can boast a first-rate 
reputation and are regarded as reliable partners should be 
attracted to Russia. This has been stated by the chairman of 
Russia's Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko. 
  Speaking in Moscow at a conference of the Consultative 
Council for Foreign Investment, he emphasized the necessity to 
preserve protectionism in respect of home banks. 
  Mr. Gerashchenko also said that in 1993 Russia's gold and 
hard currency reserves had tripled. By the first of this month 
they amounted to $5.6 billion.

  [Text] President Yeltsin has signed a decree "On Measures 
to Protect the Interests of Citizens During the Transition From 
Voucher to Cash Privatization," setting the rules to privatize 
state enterprises until a new state program for post-voucher 
privatization is adopted. 
  The decree says that after July 1 the shares of enterprises 
which have been registered before that deadline shall be sold at 
auctions and stock exchanges. 
  The decree says that the labor collectives of enterprises 
corporatized before July 1 retain all the benefits established 
by the privatization program. 
  The post-voucher privatization program setting the rules of 
privatization as of July 1, 1994 is to be put into effect by a 
presidential decree before June 31. However, according to the

the program had not yet been submitted to President Yeltsin for 
signature late Monday night.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Yeltsin to graduates of Russia's </F>
military academies in the Kremlin on 28 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Yeltsin] The hope of the Russian Army is here in 
this splendid hall. You represent those on whom its might and 
combat capability will be based. On the whole, Russia's Armed 
Forces match up to contemporary requirements for safeguarding 
the country's military security. The young Russian Army confirms 
this not just in major maneuvers and training exercises at 
strategic level. Its units and formations are successfully 
carrying out peacekeeping functions in accordance with our 
country's international commitments. 
  The main area of our military policy is reformation of the 
armed forces. They should meet the actual requirements needed 
for sufficient national defense. Gradually, and I stress here, 
gradually, the strength of the army will be reduced and brought 
down to 1.5 million servicemen. The mechanism for building the 
army up to its required strength will also undergo gradual 
changes. There is talk of increasing the share of servicemen 
undergoing military service on contracts. 
  We will continue to devote much attention to developing the 
new military infrastructure in Russia and providing it with 
everything necessary as quickly as possible. We need to learn 
how to implement a balanced military-technical policy. The root 
of the problem is that tasks we tackle should correspond to the 
actual possibilities of the country's economy. 
  It is no secret that today our funds are limited and that 
this is sharply reflected on the army. This is why it is even 
more important to allocate these funds wisely. We will have to 
reduce the number of various types of weapons and their 
modifications, material support for them, the range of 
ammunition, supplies, and spare parts. 
  Multiplicity is an unacceptable luxury right now. We need 
unification. At the same time, it is also categorically 
unacceptable to waste in the name of arms reduction a unique 
scientific and technical potential created by the armed forces. 
There are international treaties and agreements, and we will 
honestly fulfill the responsibilities which we have taken upon 
ourselves. But any so-called over-doing on our part is totally 
out of question. This is a clear position taken by the 
president, and the supreme commander in chief, and this is a 
demand of principle to the leadership of the armed forces. 
  The majority of those in this hall will soon return to the 
troops. I hope that you have mastered one of the main lessons 
of the science of winning, and this is that the power of the 
army is not only in the combat training of personnel; not only 
in commanders and military leaders mastering the art of war -- 
although there is no army without this. Its strength is not only 
in military discipline -- although there is no army without this 
either. The Russian Army was invincible when humanity got the 
upper hand over callousness within it, when a commander saw in 
each of his subordinates not a robot, not a blind piece of 
ordnance, but a human being. 
  Humanity does not mean everything goes, and it is not 
mollycoddling. In the army it means persistently teaching each 
serviceman to fulfill combat tasks and to survive in any 
situation. 
  The main thing here is not to forget the dignity of one's 
subordinates, always to feel one's personal responsibility for 
their lives. This is the testament of our best military leaders. 
This is borne out by the military experience of our best field 
commanders, and I believe that you too will not only continue, 
but will strengthen this glorious tradition. One must honestly 
acknowledge, that both previously and now, we have far from 
always been or remain true to it. 
  In a democratic state, the rights and duties of servicemen 
should be determined only by the law. The whole legal basis for 
the organization and activity of the armed forces should be 
brought into line with the Constitution and the main tenets of 
military doctrine. 
  In order to improve the overall system for the management of 
the armed forces and to strengthen their links with society, we 
shall gradually introduce and strengthen elements of civil 
control of the process of military organization. 
  At the reception in honor of the graduates of military 
academies one must not omit to mention the system of training of 
military cadres. We have a plan for the development of a system 
of military education. The training schedules and curricula of 
higher educational establishments have been detailed. The 
training of officers in many specializations lacking in the 
Russian Army has been organized. This work has to be continued. 
  A course aimed at the rational enlargement and integration 
of 
military educational institutions should become a main 
direction. By reducing quantity, the quality of training is to 
be increased. We shall continue to pay particular attention to 
issues of the social provision for armed forces personnel and 
members of their families, and also for servicemen in reserve, 
for those who gave the best years of their lives serving the 
motherland. 
  A program of providing housing for servicemen and 
demobilized 
individuals in 1994 and 1995 is being implemented. Money 
allowances and pensions, and also the salaries of blue-collar 
and white-collar workers in the Russian Army have been 
increased. To this end, despite all the difficulties, additional 
sources to finance military needs are being sought. 
  It is possible that the Ministry of Social Welfare will be 
required to create a special department for dealing with those 
discharged to the reserve, military invalids, pensioners, and 
veterans. 
  Making use of this occasion I shall dwell on matters 
concerning the foreign activity of the armed forces. Primarily, 
this means formations in the CIS collective security system. No 
one and nothing can free Russia from the political and moral 
responsibility for the fate of the countries and peoples which 
have accompanied the Russian state for centuries. Furthermore, 
the creation of a long-term system of European security -- we 
are in favor of such a system being all-embracing. It should 
include not only a bloc-structure such as NATO. What is needed 
is a broader system of partnership which would unite and 
strengthen all the currently functioning mechanisms -- the CSCE, 
the European and the Western European Unions, the Council for 
North Atlantic Cooperation, and so on. It will hardly be 
possible to construct a new edifice of European security if its 
architects seek to exclude Russia from their plans, but we too 
have to take an active part in the existing institutions of 
cooperation and not isolate ourselves from them but rather exert 
a stronger influence on their work from within. 
  Proceeding from Russia's special strategic position in 
Eurasia, we have to see the creation of an effective system of 
security in the Asian and Pacific region as a main direction in 
our military policy. We shall continue to take an active part in 
peacekeeping operations, in work to control arms and the 
proliferation of nuclear technologies, and on the whole, in 
ensuring strategic stability in the world. 
  Russian foreign policy is paying off. Our country recently 
joined the military and technical process of Partnership for 
Peace. Russia concluded an agreement on partnership and 
cooperation with the European Union. For the first time this 
century, we have entered Europe as an equal with all the other 
states of Europe. Ahead lies involvement in the conference of 
the seven most developed states in the world, and in political 
matters, fully-fledged involvement, that is G-8 [vosmerka]. For 
the present it is a political and not an economic G-8, that is 
starting to work. Each such step opens up new prospects before 
our country. 
  Tomorrow you will again return to your units and will set 
about new and greater duties. I am sure that the personnel of 
the units, vessels, formations under your leadership will 
succesfully tackle the tasks of defending the state interests of 
Russia. I wish success to you all in your difficult and 
honourable task on behalf of Russia and to the glory of the 
fatherland.

  [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- The Russian Armed Forces are 
efficient, controllable, ready to protect the state from any 
encroachments and ensure national security, including in 
peace-making, Russian Defence Minister General of the Army Pavel 
Grachev told graduates of military academies here today. 
  Today's Russia has no enemies, said the defence minister. 
"This is confirmed by major provisions of the Russian military 
doctrine and known by the whole world. However, Russia same as 
any other state has its interests of the military-political and 
geo-strategic position. We have to remember about this and 
proceed from national interests in military building," said 
Pavel Grachev. 
  The minister recalled names of renowned Russian military 
leaders and said they valued the soldier's confidence most. "Be 
more attentive to your subordinates. Remember that an army 
where an soldier believes in his officer has such an advantage 
that cannot be gained with strength, materiel and any other 
thing," said Grachev. 
  The armed forces are interested in social stability and 
civic 
peace. "Unity and accord are necessary for prosperity of the 
state and successful development of the military sphere," said 
the minister.

  [Text] Late in June 1954 the world learned about the 
launching of the first nuclear power station on the earth in the 
town of Obninsk close to Moscow. The scientific community all 
over the globe is now marking the 40th anniversary of that event. 
  At present in Russia the nuclear power industry accounts 
only 
for 12 percent of total electricity output. We have had a long 
range objective for the share to grow to 30 or 35 percent. Now 
some details from the first deputy minister of atomic energy of 
the Russian Federation, Lev Ryabev. 
  [Begin Ryabev recording in Russian fading to English 
translation] Over the past five years with nuclear disarmament 
under way we have been striving to use our potential, first of 
all scientific potential, to solve problems of safety in the 
Russian nuclear power industry, and other issues, including 
those of ecology. This country is now drafting a new power 
program up to the year 2010. The strategy of developing the 
nuclear power industry is part of the program. For the first 
time in the record of this industry, the program incorporates a 
profound economic and ecological analysis. 
  We are now developing reactors and reactor stations of the 
so-called third generation to keep abreast of the latest 
requirements adopted by the International Association for 
Nuclear Affairs. These new developments are scheduled for the 
beginning of the next century to boost the nuclear power 
industry. Large-scale and wide-ranging research is under way in 
the birthplace of the nuclear power industry, Obninsk, at the 
Physics and Energy Institute. The main objective of the center 
is to develop fast neutron reactors. The researchers there have 
proved that this is a highly promising line of studies. [end 
recording] 
  The first deputy minister of Russia's atomic energy, Ryabev, 
concludes by saying that as for a look for another 40 years, he 
feels the nuclear power industry's safety problems will be 
solved drastically. The problems of highly radioactive waste 
will also be solved with fine results for ecology. As the 
nuclear power industry here keeps developing on a large-scale, 
it will hold even greater positions in the long-term and that 
will amount to economic gains for Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Issa Kostoyev, chairman of the Federation </F>
Council Committee for Constitutional Legislation and 
Judicial-Legal Questions, by Yuriy Zvyagin, Yevgeniy Skukin; 
date, place not given: "The Innocent Could Suffer"] 
  [Text] Issa Kostoyev, chairman of the Federation Council 
Committee for Constitutional Legislation and Judicial-Legal 
Questions, comments on the Russian Federation president's Edict 
"On Urgent Measures To Protect the Population Against 
Gangsterism and Other Manifestations of Organized Crime." He 
has devoted 28 years to investigative work as an ordinary 
investigator, criminal prosecutor, investigator for especially 
important cases, deputy chief of an investigation unit, and then 
chief of the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office 
department for the investigation of crimes against the person. 
He has the solving of many of the most dangerous crimes to his 
credit, including, incidentally, the Chikatilo [serial killer] 
case. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Issa Magometovich, a heated debate has 
broken out over the president's edict. What do you make of this 
document? 
  [Kostoyev] If we are talking about the tasks the president 
has set the law-enforcement organs, they are the same as those 
stated in the five similar edicts of recent years. A long, long 
time ago someone should have said: Bring the culprits to book. 
Why have you boys not been implementing these edicts? 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] What have been the specific 
consequences of the failure to implement the previous edicts? 
  [Kostoyev] Well, for example, MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] staff are now working for private firms, banks, and 
commercial offices. And their new bosses are completely 
satisfied with them. They do not take just anyone but will 
hire, in particular, anyone who has had to fight organized crime 
during his service and anyone who has lawful credentials and the 
right to carry a gun. In the morning this man turns up at his 
own section: He says that he is going to meet one of his agents, 
but he actually goes to a private office. Incidentally, a 
militiaman must always be on call, even in his spare time. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Be that as it may, the draft Federation 
Council decree prepared by your committee instructs the general 
prosecutor to ensure rigorous observance of citizens' rights and 
freedoms and to establish strict monitoring of the conduct of 
investigations. Do you therefore see a possibility of using the 
edict within the framework of existing legislation? 
  [Kostoyev] Under one article of the Constitution the 
president's edicts must be implemented on the territory of the 
entire Russian state, under another an edict must conform with 
the constitution and federal laws. All we can do as jurists is 
try to put up a barrier against anything that contradicts the 
law, so that innocent people do not suffer. Edict No. 1226 
contradicts the constitution, the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
the Law on Enterprises and Entrepreneurial Activity, the Law on 
Banks and Banking Activity, and the Law on Operational 
Investigation Activity. I think that, like the previous edicts, 
it will not be fully implemented and will not have the desired 
results. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] How does this edict relate to the 
federal program to intensify the fight against crime for the 
years 1994-1995? 
  [Kostoyev] Very strangely. The 24 May edict instructs the 
Russian Federation Justice Ministry, jointly with other 
interested federal executive branch bodies, to prepare within 
two months proposals on, I stress, making appropriate amendments 
to Russian Federation legislative acts, making provision for 
giving the militia the right to search buildings and premises of 
enterprises of all forms of ownership, etc. But what has 
emerged is a direct-action edict based on such wishes instead of 
legislative acts. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Nonetheless, what is needed to stop 
crime? 
  [Kostoyev] The aforementioned federal program was 
recommended by deputies, invited specialists, and 
representatives of ministries and departments at the April 
parliamentary hearings on this subject. It was decided to give 
priority consideration to laws aimed at protecting the 
constitutional rights of citizens, witnesses, and people 
administering justice -- in short, aimed at taking appropriate 
counteraction against organized crime. I think that precise 
compliance with the federal program and the quickest possible 
adoption of laws, many of which have passed their first or 
second reading, are what will put up a real barrier to crime.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yermolin: "Federation Council Agrees </F>
to 40.6 Trillion Rubles: Upper Chamber of Federal Assembly 
Votes in Favor of the 1994 Budget Passed by the State Duma"] 
  [Text] The evolution in the Federation Council's attitude 
to the 1994 draft federal budget law may be roughly 
characterized as "no, no, no -- yes!" A categorical "no" rang 
out from public platforms, was uttered into journalists' 
microphones, and was heard in statements made, above all, by the 
Federation Council chairman. "Yes" rang out immediately the 
budget just passed by the State Duma reached the Federation 
Council. 
  Let us recall that the members of the Federation Council 
were 
going to back to the bitter end defense expenditure of 55 
trillion and an increase in expenditure items for the regions. 
Commenting on the upper chamber's decision, Vladimir Shumeyko 
assured people that a compromise had been reached between the 
sides. What does this amount to as regards expenditure on 
national defense? Let us study carefully the results of the 
second and third readings: In both cases you have the figure of 
40.6 trillion. 
  Indeed, there could be no other outcome. Had the Federation 
Council started to wage a struggle over the budget, it would 
have become obvious to everyone that the senators had assumed 
total responsibility for the country's extrabudgetary existence. 
Naturally, they had no wish to shoulder this burden. Moreover, 
President Yeltsin made it perfectly clear two weeks ago that all 
the key budget figures had been agreed with Viktor 
Chernomyrdinn, Ivan Rybkin, and Vladimir Shumeyko. 
  It is pointless to bewail the sickly defense budget now. The 
most important thing is to flesh out the intention of the 
president, government, and parliamentarians to eliminate the 
defense budget deficit by means of extrabudgetary appropriations. 
  You are prompted to draw the conclusion that there are few 
statesmen in our time capable of resisting the temptation to 
demonstrate their concern over defense problems. But when it 
comes to making a decision, quite different interests prevail. 
To be honest, the stance of those who opposed 55 trillion from 
the very outset is far more understandable and attractive. But 
such people, those who did not break into "defense rhetoric," 
were few in number.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature, by correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, E. Terekhov and others] 
  [Text] Russia pins hopes on negotiations on the nuclear 
theme between the United States and North Korea, due to begin in 
Geneva, but still wants an international conference on the 
issue. "Moscow's proposal to that effect is still on the 
agenda", the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has told 
Interfax. He was speaking in Moscow on Tuesday after talks with 
his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen. 
  Kozyrev said "Russia and China are unanimous that to ensure 
the non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula political 
solutions must be found." 
  "Our Chinese counterparts have taken interest in Russia's 
proposal to convene an international conference. They have the 
intention to consider the most suitable conditions, when they 
take shape, in order to return to that idea once again", Kozyrev 
said. 
  Qian Qichen said that China and Russia's great interest in 
resolving the problem stems from their geographic proximity to 
the Korean Peninsula. "We wish to see the success of the 
forthcoming US-North-Korean talks. As for Russia's proposal to 
convene an international conference, China has responded to it 
with understanding. We believe, however, that proposal can 
materialize only when there are appropriate favorable conditions 
for it." 
  Kozyrev said that Russian-Chinese relations were on the 
ascent. "That upward trend will reach a culmination when China's 
Premier [as received] Jiang Zemin visits Russia in the autumn. 
During that visit at least five or six agreements, including a 
major political treaty will be signed", he said. 
  Kozyrev said he was certain that the Chinese Premier's visit 
to Russia would become "a land-mark event in fostering 
neighborly and friendly relations and partnership between the 
Russia and China." 
  After the foreign ministers ended the talks their deputies 
Aleksandr Panov and Dai Bingguo initialled an agreement on the 
Russian-Chinese state border in the West and signed a protocol 
of cooperation in the field of information exchanges between the 
Russian and Chinese foreign ministries. 
  Kozyrev's Political Advisor Galina Sidorova told Interfax 
that during the talks with Kozyrev Qian Quichen said he was 
satisfied with partnership established between Russia and the 
Western countries and NATO. 
  Kozyrev stressed that Russia was developing partnership both 
with the West and the East, including China. Such relations 
will help to strengthen international security, are not aimed 
against the interests of any third countries and reflect the 
special situation of Russia as a great European power, Sidorova 
said.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- Talks between Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen 
culminated today in the initialing of a bilateral agreement on 
the western sector of the Russian-Chinese border. The document 
is expected to be signed in early September during the second 
Russian-Chinese summit meeting. 
  The USSR and China concluded an agreement on the eastern 
sector of the border in 1991. ITAR-TASS was told at the Russian 
Foreign Ministry that agreement has now been reached on a 55-km 
stretch of the border with Altay Kray, on which Russia has never 
had a treaty with contemporary China. 
  "There are no problems or disagreement between us, so the 
talks were a success," a Foreign Ministry official said. He 
added that there have been no territorial concessions by either 
side. 
  After the agreement is signed it will have to be ratified by 
the parliaments of both countries.

  [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen invited Russia to participate in a tender for the right 
to ship equipment for a cascade of hydropower stations on the 
Yangtze river. 
  The proposal was made at his meeting on Wednesday with First 
Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets who welcomed the idea 
saying "Russia should not lose long-standing relations with 
Chinese partners especially in those industries where it has 
good chances and advantageous positions". 
  Soskovets called on China to "specify its interests in trade 
and economic, as well as in military and technical cooperation". 
Russia is "actively opening new markets now, including that of 
weapons", he said. 
  Qian responded by saying that "trade and economic relations 
and military-technical ties comprise a very important part of 
our relations in general". 
  Although the Chinese minister said trade relations are 
developing successfully between the two countries and the 
turnover reached eight billion dollars last year, he opposed the 
so-called "shuttle trade" when individual traders fill the 
Russian market with low- quality Chinese goods. He proposed to 
replace them by reliable and major companies. 
  Soskovets, however, said that he can give no guarantees 
about 
any of the companies advertising themselves on the Russian TV. 
  Soskovets expressed big interest in the Chinese experience 
of 
economic reforms and especially in creating free trade zones. 
"The Chinese experience is of great interest to us", he said.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- PRC President Jiang Zemin is to 
pay an official visit to Russia at the beginning of September 
this year. An accord on this was reached during the visit to 
Moscow by Qian Qichen, vice premier of the PRC State Council and 
foreign minister. "We virtually only have to agree on dates with 
you. The month has already been set," Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin said, when he received the head of the Chinese Foreign 
Ministry in the Kremlin today. The Russian president suggested 
that the schedule proposed by the Chinese side be shifted by two 
days and that the summit begin on 2 September.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said today after talks with his Chinese counterpart Qian 
Qichen that at least six or seven agreements, including a "major 
political document," will be signed during the forthcoming 
Moscow summit between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and PRC 
President Jiang Zemin. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from trustworthy sources 
that the summit is planned for the first week in September. 
  Andrey Kozyrev described the forthcoming summit as a 
"landmark" in Russo-Chinese relations which, in his words, are 
now developing in a stable manner. 
  Qian Qichen agreed with this assessment. He noted, however, 
that "certain issues have arisen" in what is, on the whole, a 
dynamic trade exchange between the two countries, and overcoming 
these would make it possible to increase business ties more 
successfully. 
  In the words of the Russian minister, the sides discussed 
the 
Korean nuclear problem in quite some detail. "We are agreed on 
ensuring the nonnuclear status of the Korean peninsula and on 
seeking political solutions," Andrey Kozyrev said. He added 
that the Russian proposal to hold a multilateral conference on 
the Korean issue still stands. 
  Both China and Russia, Qian Qichen said, are very close 
neighbors of the Korean peninsula, and both countries want a 
settlement of the difficulties over Korea. As for the Russian 
initiative, China regards this proposal "with understanding." 
However, it believes that "the appropriate conditions are 
required" for it to be put into practice.

<F P=106> [Video report from Kubinka by Vladimir Lenskiy and Vladimir </F>
Avdeyev -- from the "Today" newscast] 
  [Text] [Presenter Tatyana Mitkova] A ranking Chinese 
general inspected the Russian aerodrome at Kubinka near Moscow 
today with a possible deal in mind. 
  [Lenskiy over video of Chinese, Russian officers viewing 
Su-25 taxiing, formation display by four Su-27] Colonel General 
of Aviation Cao Shuang-Ming, commander of the Chinese Air Force, 
viewed flights by Su-25 assault aircraft and Su-27 and MiG-29 
fighters at Kubinka today. 
  According to Russia's Frontal Aviation Commander Nikolay 
Antoshkin, the Kubinka airfield hosts up to 120 delegations a 
year. Some are shown aircraft to reinforce relations, others 
for advertising purposes. 
  Today's demonstration of the wonders of our combat aviation 
combined friendship and business. The Kubinka Sky Hussars' 
flight is named for Kozhedub, who is also a national hero in 
China. What is more, our great Eastern neighbor is buying Su-27 
fighters from Russia. But today the leadership of the Chinese 
Air Force was particularly interested in the MiG-29. Nikolay 
Antoshkin encouraged this interest in every possible way. 
  [Antoshkin] This is profitable for the state and the people. 
If we do not sell, someone else will. 
  [Lenskiy] Russia currently has to compete in the aircraft 
market with the FRG, the United States, France, Britain, and 
Italy. Even though specialists claim that a Western equivalent 
of the Su-27 will not be available before the year 2000. 
  The Chinese delegation was particularly happy to note that 
one of the Sky Hussars' aircraft is piloted by a woman. 
Lyudmila Pukito flies a Su-25 assault aircraft. She says that 
there are female military pilots in many countries. Lyudmila 
can't understand why she is being singled out. 
  [Pukito] But if our aircraft are made even more popular as a 
result, I will have served my purpose. 
  [Lenskiy] Raising the popularity of Russian military 
aircraft is not cheap for the Russian Air Force. A 
demonstration flight on one of these aircraft costs 200,000 
rubles at 1992 prices. However, the Air Force leadership 
believes that the game is worth the candle.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "PRC's Top Diplomat in Moscow"] </F>
  [Text] Qian Qichen, deputy premier of the State Council 
and PRC foreign minister, arrived on an official visit to Moscow 
Monday evening. The main aim of the trip is to prepare for the 
Russo-Chinese summit. It is planned that PRC Chairman Jiang 
Zemin will be coming to Moscow in September. 
  "China and Russia," Qian Qichen stated at the airport, "are 
neighbors with common borders. It is quite natural for us to 
maintain constant contacts. I am confident that my current 
visit to Russia will be very successful." 
  The 66-year-old Qian Qichen, who speaks Russian, English, 
and 
French, is no newcomer to the Moscow dimension of PRC foreign 
policy. He made his "great leap forward" into big-time politics 
in 1982, when he became China's special representative at the 
intergovernmental political consultations with the USSR. Five 
years later, a year before being appointed foreign minister, 
Qian headed the delegation at the bilateral border talks. In 
the memorable year of 1989 he was already quite at home in the 
top diplomat's office -- and the process of normalizing 
Soviet-Chinese relations was completed with his direct 
participation. 
  Qian Qichen has displayed exceptional qualities in the field 
of diplomacy, primarily a purposefulness and an analytical way 
of thinking. He is given a lot of the credit for the fact that, 
following the suppression of the student demonstrations in 
Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989 and the introduction of 
anti-Chinese sanctions by the West, the PRC nonetheless did not 
remain internationally isolated, and the situation regarding 
China did not turn into a new "cold war." 
  Any high-ranking Chinese leader's personal life is reliably 
hidden from prying eyes. All we know for sure is that Qian is a 
man of routine -- he never gets up later than 0600 and retires 
precisely at 2300. He loves going for walks.

  [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- "North Korea has more 
plutonium than it has reported", Director of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Hans Blix said in Moscow on 
Wednesday. 
  He told TASS that his agency aims to clarify the total 
amount 
of radioactive waste in North Korea and the location of its 
burial places. 
  Blix hopes that Pyongyang "will raise the curtain of 
mystery" 
over the fate of the radioactive fuel from its 5 mgwatt reactor 
and said talks are currently being held with North Korea on the 
problem. 
  The IAEA director played down fears about the scope of 
illegal exports of radioactive waste stolen by criminal groups. 
He said that 95 per cent of reported cases turned out to be 
pure inventions. However, some cases did take place and were 
thoroughly investigated. Blix added that he had already held 
negotiations with nuclear powers and agreed with them that it is 
necessary to cut short criminal attempts to smuggle out 
radioactive waste. He believes a special organisation 
resembling the FBI might be set up for the purpose. 
  Dwelling on the future of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant 
in Ukraine where the worst nuclear disaster occurred in 1986, 
Blix said that the Ukrainian Government wants to keep the plant 
running because of economic problems and that the leaderships of 
Western Europe are ready to help it. However, in future the 
obsolete reactors of the plant are to be replaced, he added.

Surzhanskiy] 
  [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- Russia and NATO are ready to 
implement the partnership for peace program, Russian Defence 
Minister General of the Army Pavel Grachev and NATO Supreme 
Allied Commander Europe General George Joulwan confirmed here 
today. 
  In July military experts will start to elaborate a 
presentation document on aspects of Russian-NATO cooperation, 
Grachev told a news conference at the Defence Ministry on 
results of his meeting with Joulwan. Some 1994 arrangements 
totalling 30 will be specified, and plans for 1995 military 
cooperation will be made more detailed. The Russia-signed 
framework document of the partnership for peace program and the 
Russia-NATO protocol to the program with the same name open up 
diverse prospects for military cooperation, said the defence 
minister. 
  The meeting agreed to open NATO posts in Russia and Russian 
posts at the NATO Supreme Allied Command and NATO Command 
Headquarters, as well as establish telephone communications 
between the Russian armed forces' general staff and the NATO 
Supreme Allied Command. 
  In the opinion of Pavel Grachev, bilateral cooperation will 
also involve fleets and districts "up to military units". 
Cooperation plans provide for participation of the Russian 
Defence Ministry's staffers in NATO exercises as observers and 
negotiations of the Russian armed forces' general staff and the 
NATO Supreme Allied Command. The main condition of these 
relations is the account of Russian interests and adoption of 
well-coordinated decisions, said the Russian defence minister.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- The readiness of Russia and NATO 
to embark on practical steps to implement the Partnership for 
Peace program was confirmed today at a meeting between Russian 
Federation Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev and NATO 
Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, General George Joulwan. 
  Addressing a news conference at the Russian Defense Ministry 
on the results of the meeting, Pavel Grachev said that joint 
preparations for a presentational document, reflecting specific 
measures of cooperation between Russia and NATO, would start in 
July at the level of military experts. Among other things, this 
would clarify certain measures planned for 1994, of which there 
are more than 30, and produce more detailed plans for military 
cooperation in 1995. The minister said that the framework 
document of Partnership for Peace and the Russia-NATO protocol 
to the same program, both signed by Russia, open up a variety of 
prospects for military cooperation. 
  Pavel Grachev noted that during the meeting agreement was 
reached on the establishment of NATO missions in Russia and 
Russian military missions at NATO's Supreme Allied Command, 
Europe, and at NATO HQS. Agreement was also reached on a 
telephone link between the General Staff of the Russian armed 
forces and NATO's Supreme Allied Command. 
  According to Pavel Grachev, cooperation would also develop 
between fleets and districts, "which will also take in military 
units." Plans for cooperation also envisage participation by 
Russian Defense Ministry representatives as observers at NATO 
military exercises and talks between the General Staff of the 
Russian Federation armed forces and NATO's Supreme Allied 
Command. Pavel Grachev described consideration for Russia's 
interests and the adoption of mutually agreed decisions as the 
main condition for the development of such ties.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Golts: "Crisis Nearly Over, Talks </F>
Begin"] 
  [Text] The Korean peninsula crisis seems to have passed. 
Moreover, the current shifts in relations between the two Korean 
states, and also in relations between the DPRK and the United 
States, inspire hope that the situation on the peninsula will be 
finally extricated from four decades of deadlock. 
  It has just been announced that agreement has been reached 
on 
holding a first-ever meeting between the leaders of the DPRK and 
South Korea. It was simultaneously reported in Washington that 
a third round of talks between the DPRK and the United States 
will begin in Geneva on 8 July. Judging by statement by the 
White House press secretary, American diplomats are geared up 
for serious work. 
  "Talks will continue until such time as they are 
productive," 
she said. Particular importance attaches to the fact that 
Washington has acknowledged that the DPRK nuclear program has 
been frozen. 
  So we can heave a sigh of relief: A situation fraught with 
almost the danger of war has now been successfully defused. It 
is time to ponder the lessons of what has happened. The main 
one, in my view, is that the world community has to accept that 
the world contains and will obviously continue to contain states 
which are highly different from each other in terms of system 
and ideology. And it is absolutely senseless to attempt to 
change them with the help of threats and sanctions. Because the 
result could turn out to be the opposite of what you wanted. 
  Thus, like it or not, the only road is the broadest possible 
communication with these states at all levels. It is necessary 
to destroy the myth that "external forces" are threatening their 
countries' independence. It is not through threats but through 
consistent dialogue that these countries can be integrated into 
the world community. It seems that trial and error has brought 
this realization to even those who only yesterday were counting 
solely on sanctions.

  [Text] Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said he did 
not consider possible the presence of UN "blue helmets" in a 
peace- keeping operation in Abkhazia. 
  He told INTERFAX at a news-conference in Moscow that he had 
received this impression after a conversation with the UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  Grachev stressed that Russia would welcome an international 
peace force in the region "on any terms" and "even under any 
command." However, he said the UN is only ready to post more 
observers in the area rather than to carry out a large scale 
operation to disengage the Georgian and Abkhaz forces. 
  He did not rule out the involvement of CIS troops in the 
operation, however only after a CIS summit in September. 
  He doubted that any former Soviet republic could dispatch to 
the region of Georgian-Abkhaz confrontation a contingent as big 
as the Russian force. Commonwealth states, in his opinion, 
could send only small units, and the countries without armed 
forces of their own could support the peace-keeping operation 
with money. 
  Grachev said the mission in Abkhazia has so far been going 
smoothly and strictly to schedule. All troops and military 
hardware intended for the operation have been brought into the 
region. Grachev estimated the Russian force at 2300 men.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Vasiliy Belchenko, assistant </F>
commander of the Group of Russian Forces in the Transcausasus, 
by correspondent Vladimir Sarishvili in Tbilisi; date not given: 
"They Came for the Sake of Peace"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- To use the currently topical soccer 
terminology, you could say that the winning attack of reason on 
the once apparently impregnable bastions of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian war is unfolding in a "breakaway attack." 
  The Russian battalions have embarked on a peacekeeping 
action 
in the conflict zone. Its progress and certain aspects of 
Russian-Georgian military cooperation are the subject of your 
TRUD correspondent's interview with Major General Vasiliy 
Belchenko, assistant commander of the Group of Russian Forces in 
the Transcausasus. 
  "Two battalions have been assigned from the Group of Russian 
Forces in the Transcaucasus to carry out this mission," Vasiliy 
Fedorovich says. "They will be deployed along the east bank of 
the Inguri river, where seven checkpoints and the same number of 
observation posts will be set up. Overall leadership of the 
peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia will be exercised by Russian 
Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev. The 
mission, which is to be fulfilled by some 3,000 officers and 
men, will involve not only disengagement, but also the 
withdrawal and storage of heavy equipment and artillery and the 
protection of facilities and main railroads and highways with a 
view to safeguarding the passage of refugees and humanitarian 
freight. 
  "Security guarantees have been given at the highest state 
level. Railroad communication will be restored very soon, as 
Vladislav Ardzinba has said. The bridge over the Inguri by 
which the refugees will return will also begin to function in 
the next few days. So everything is ready for the process to 
begin." 
  [Sarishvili] Russia is taking on a grave and responsible 
mission. What could hamper its implementation? 
  [Belchenko] For a long time it was impossible to find points 
of contact for a reconciliation. We recognize the full 
complexity of the role we have assumed. But the Georgian and 
Abkhazian sides should also take a very responsible attitude to 
the political settlement process. Unfortunately there have been 
many examples of local resistance leading to the disruption of 
peacekeeping efforts. But in this case there is the firm hope 
that, on condition that there is support from the sides, the 
action will achieve its goal and the war, which everyone is sick 
and tired of, will become a thing of the past. 
  We wish wholeheartedly for this, because the road through 
Abkhazia is a vital road for Russia too. The paralysis of 
railroad communications is ruinous for all of us. 
  [Sarishvili] Let us concentrate on some of the details. It 
was reported on television that total mine clearance is not 
possible today. What is this -- a display of distrust? 
  [Belchenko] No, and again no. The point is that the troops 
are tasked with going in within a very tight time scale. 
Therefore mine clearance will take place first and foremost in 
the sectors where checkpoints are to be established and people 
are to be stationed. The rest of the territory will be cleared 
later. 
  [Sarishvili] What reaction is envisaged in the event of 
armed provocations? 
  [Belchenko] If a battalion carrying the peacekeeping flag 
comes under fire, it will return fire for effect. Russia is 
sending its soldiers not to be killed, but to help establish 
peace. 
  [Sarishvili] And if Georgian-Abkhazian fighting flares up 
again? 
  [Belchenko] We are under orders to suppress any seats of 
fire, after a warning. But I do not think it will come to that, 
since the heavy equipment and artillery is to be withdrawn to a 
safe distance. 
  [Sarishvili] Have the peacekeepers had special training? 
  [Belchenko] At all events, they are not Spetsnaz 
[special-purpose forces]. They are regular servicemen, only 
rather better "welded together" and drilled. 
  [Sarishvili] How will disputes over houses unlawfully seized 
by mercenaries in Abkhazia be resolved? 
  [Belchenko] That question is not within my competence. But 
on the basis of the experience of the Tskhinvali region it can 
be assumed that the work of restoring justice and sorting out 
all the problems will be carried out by mixed commissions under 
the protection of the peacekeeping forces. 
  [Sarishvili] Do you detect any signs of a thaw in 
Georgian-Abkhazian relations? 
  [Belchenko] Judging by Shevardnadze's and Ardzinba's 
remarks, there is a sense that contact is becoming a reality. 
This is also perceptible in people's mood. 
  [Sarishvili] Vasiliy Fedorovich, the question of Russian 
military bases in Georgia is also on the agenda. On what 
principle will they operate? 
  [Belchenko] Most likely on the basis of compensation. For 
instance, as we reduce the numerical strength of our units we 
will hand over to Georgia the housing stock, which can be 
regarded as a rent in exchange for the use of the territory. 
  [Sarishvili] A kind of military barter system? 
  [Belchenko] You could call it that. But the military camps 
are just one possible illustration. 
  [Sarishvili] What do you see as the points of contact of 
interests in military cooperation between Georgia and Russia? 
  [Belchenko] First and foremost, mutual membership of a 
system of collective security, which gives us a basis for 
mutually beneficial cooperation. Rather than each racking your 
brains to invent the bicycle, it is better to make use of the 
rich experience of the former Soviet Army. Talk of the 
"enslavement" of Georgia and the "imperial ambitions" of Russia 
seems to me to be idle or provocative. Colonel General Fedor 
Reut, commander of the Group of Russian Forces in the 
Transcausasus, invites both the Georgian head of state and the 
defense minister to attend any of our measures. 
  It is in our interests to see Georgia a strong and 
prosperous 
state. Military cooperation will open up broad economic 
prospects. Why lose, for instance, the Batumi uniform factory 
with its trained personnel and production base? Why waste money 
on transporting goods unnecessarily when everything is already 
available? The same could be said of food and raw materials 
bases. 
  In conclusion I would like to mention the thoughtful and 
considered stance of head of state E. Shevardnadze. Today he 
has chosen, I believe, the only correct path -- that of 
rapprochement, which I am sure will be to everyone's benefit.

<F P=106> [Report by Petr Karapetyan and Sergey Prokopenko: "Russian </F>
Peacekeeping Soldiers Have Taken Up Positions Between Warring 
Sides. Our Special Correspondents Report From the 
Abkhazian-Georgian Border"] 
  [Text] Gali-Sukhumi-Gudauta -- During the afternoon of 24 
June two battalions of the 145th Motorized Infantry Division, 
having completed their march from Batumi, arrived in the 
vicinity of Zugdidi. They therefore came under the command of 
the eastern monitoring zone headquarters and took custody of 
three checkpoints and 10 monitoring and observation posts. 
  Restoration work is continuing on the railroad bridge across 
the Inguri river. Let us remind readers that similar work has 
already been completed on the road bridge. In our view, the 
following fact is pretty significant: All the work is being 
carried out, let us stress deliberately, by Russian 
peacekeepers. It is hard for the authors of this report to 
shake off the feeling that the local authorities on both sides 
of the Inguri have acted in line with the principle "here come 
the Russians; they will do everything themselves." That is in 
fact how things have turned out. 
  In our view, the situation in the western zone is somewhat 
more complex. Whereas the Zugdidi area has been practically 
cleared of Zviadist detachments, on the other bank bandit 
formations and detachments of marauders are running amok and 
shipping out booty by the truckload. The bandits have stepped 
up their activities because in the next few days the border will 
be closed, thus putting a stop to their "business." 
  Incidentally, a word or two about the border along the 
Inguri. Until the mountain passes were opened, it stretched for 
82 km. We were informed by Abkhazian Defense Ministry spokesman 
Valeriy Gumba that with the opening of the passes its length 
increased to 100-110 km. In our view, this point needs to be 
noted. First of all, and most important, up to now there has 
been no political decision on the border. This gives both sides 
a pretext for defining where the border is as the prevailing 
situation dictates. 
  Second, the border as understood in the conventional sense 
does not exist. There is no border strip and no barbed wire. 
There is the river, and that is the border. In spring, when 
the snow started to melt in the mountains, the Inguri changed 
its course, and 13 Abkhazian guardsmen found themselves...on the 
Georgian side. Their punishment was short and brutal. Russian 
peacekeepers should be prepared for the fact that in certain 
border sectors, which it would be impossible to control even 
with all the available forces (a task which has not actually 
been set), there could occasionally be armed clashes. Our two 
mobile groups have been deployed on both sides of the Inguri to 
deal with this eventuality. 
  The western monitoring zone headquarters are located in 
Gali. 
Its "patch" comprises two checkpoints and 17 monitoring and 
observation points. Mine clearance in the deployment area in 
this region has been completed. 
  This situation "in the west" is also complicated as a result 
of the following factors. Under the agreed plan -- which we 
have reported on -- a 12-km security zone completely free of 
weapons is to be established on both sides of the Inguri. This 
is the first inconsistency. Some time ago the Abkhazian 
authorities promulgated an edict allowing people to keep 
weapons. As far as we know, this edict has not been repealed 
and apparently there are no plans to repeal it. Consequently 
the likelihood that the principle "have gun, will shoot" will 
operate is fairly high. 
  We can even predict where this might happen. In the Kodori 
canyon, which is not a zone for which the Russian peacekeeping 
forces are responsible. Unburdened by the cares of having to 
guard the border, the commanders of Abkhazian and Georgian armed 
detachments are concentrating their forces in the Kodori canyon. 
According to information at our disposal, literally the other 
day a big detachment of Svanetians [Georgians] entered the 
canyon under the command of Emzari Ketsmariani. It is not hard 
to predict the future course of events: If the tempo of the 
political settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict does not 
match the urgency of the moment, then the currently shaky peace 
could be blown to pieces right here in the Kodori canyon, deep 
in the rear of the Russian peacekeeping forces. 
  A decision was made 26 June to carry out a peacekeeping 
operation in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. We were 
informed by Major General Vasiliy Yakushev that he plans to 
complete the peacekeeping forces' engagement before 3 July.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 
1245 GMT on 27 June carries a telephone interview with Andrey 
Olegov, a spokesman for Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 
security service, by Mayak Panorama correspondent Anatoliy 
Fedorov. In the interview, Olegov denies a report published 
over the weekend in MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS under the title of 
"Assassination Attempt on Yeltsin?" The article says that on 24 
June, about an hour before Yeltsin visited the Greek parliament 
building in Athens, an unidentified device exploded in the 
parliament building. The security service's information on the 
incident indicates that an explosive device was planted near the 
entrance to the European parliament building a few hours before 
the EU summit meeting on Corfu. The blast caused panic but no 
injuries. President Yeltsin was attending the Corfu meeting at 
the time. The Athens police links this terrorist act with the 
Revolutionary Popular Struggle organization, which is opposed to 
Greek membership of the EU. 
  Olegov says: "In this case, then, this should primarily be 
regarded as a demonstrative act aimed against the Greek 
membership of the European Union, not as an act directed 
specifically against the representatives of heads of state who 
were present at the European summit on Corfu." He adds that the 
Greek police are investigating the incident.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- The Indian Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao begins an official visit to Russia today. Talks 
between the Indian prime minister and Russian officials will 
focus on problems of military and military-technical cooperation 
between Russia and India. 
  In technical respect, the Indian armed forces are 
predominantly oriented to Soviet-made and Russian weapons. 
According to the data available, 85 per cent of the military 
hardware in the Indian Navy are Russian-made, the Indian Air 
Force is equipped with Russian-made hardware up to 80 per cent, 
the Army -- to 65 per cent and the Air- Defence Troops - to 100 
per cent. 
  Russia, which had faced the threat of the loss of the Indian 
market which would have resulted in tens of billion dollars 
losses, after a certain stalemate in this sphere, finally 
determined the Indian direction as one of those of priority 
importance. 
  At present, Russia is not only supplying spare parts to the 
Russian-made hardware, but sells licenses for the production of 
weapons in India. Russian and Indian firms signed an agreement 
on the creation of a joint venture for servicing aircraft of the 
"MiG" series and producing spare parts for them. During the 
Indian prime minister's visit to Russia this document is 
expected to be approved at a government level. The 
modernisation of jet-fighters of the "MiG-21" series used by the 
Indian Navy will begin in the near future under a contract worth 
350 million dollars. These jet- fighters will be equipped with 
controllable missiles, new systems of controlling weapons and 
modern equipment on board. 
  The program of the production of jet-bombers of the MiG-27 
series according to the Russian license is expected to be 
carried through in a year's time. A total of 120 such bombers 
had already been built, which makes up two-thirds of the planned 
amount. India intends to use its industrial potential for the 
production of a new type of jet-fighters of the Su-30 series. 
According to the data available, Moscow is prepared to offer 
about 30 "Su-30" jet-fighters on credit to India and sell a 
license for their production. 
  In June, 1994, a high-ranking delegation of the Indian 
Defence Ministry led by the Air-Force Marshal Krishnaswami 
discussed these problems in Russia and visited the Irkutsk 
aircraft building plant, where the trials of the new jet-fighter 
were held. Indian experts qualified the "Su-30" jet-fighter as 
a plane, which in its technical characteristics equals the 
American "F-18" and the European "Tornado" jet-fighters and 
surpasses the F-16 and the French "Mirage-2000" aircraft. The 
"Su-30" is equipped with a 30 millimeter-caliber gun, 10 
missiles of various types and equipment which enables to refuel 
the aircraft in the air, which maximally improves the aircraft's 
capacity to spot and destroy targets both in the air and on the 
ground. 
  India might possibly buy 30 jet-bombers of the "MiG-29" type 
and six jet-fighters of the "MiG 29YB" type worth around 780 
million dollars. In mid-May, a series of contracts for the 
construction of missile boats, frigates and border guard ships 
in India under Russian licenses were signed in New Delhi by the 
director general of the Russia "Rosvooruzheniye" company, Viktor 
Samoylov. All main units, completing parts and weapons for 
theses ships will be supplied by Russia. 
  Both Moscow and New Delhi officials believe that the Indian 
prime minister's visit to Moscow is expected to give a new 
impetus to the development of military-technical cooperation 
between the two countries.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- First Russian Vice-Premier 
Oleg Soskovets suggested today to conclude a Russian-IAEA 
agreement on the regime of nuclear energy uses at a meeting with 
IAEA Director-General Hans Blix. 
  Russian Minister for Nuclear Power Engineering Viktor 
Mikhailov told ITAR-TASS that the agreement will aim to 
establish partner relations in peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
He hopes that the former Soviet republics that have nuclear 
power plants will join the IAEA and sign a similar agreement. 
Russia will help this process, he said. 
  In 1994 Russia plans to pay part of its debt to the IAEA at 
a 
sum of 11 million U.S. dollars. The overall Russian debt to the 
international organization is estimated at 40 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  In his turn, the IAEA director-general called on the Russian 
side for the soonest completion of the construction of nuclear 
energy- producing facilities. He said that delays are simply 
not economical. He is also concerned over Russian non-joining 
of the Paris and Vienna conventions under which specialists from 
the state guilty of a nuclear accident carry full responsibility 
for it. In the words of Soskovets, not a single state was 
affected more than Russia by the Chernobyl nuclear accident.

<F P=106> [Report by Yelena Kalyadina: "Peter the Great Opened a </F>
Window onto Europe but Boris Opened a Door. Russia in 
Partnership and Cooperation with the European Union. A 
Successful Choice, It Seems"] 
  [Excerpt] Corfu-Moscow -- Russian foreign policy has made 
a headlong rush into the West's embrace. Confirming by his 
signature in Brussels Russia's agreement to take part in NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program, Andrey Kozyrev picked up a new 
document and headed immediately for the Greek island of Corfu. 
The following day the 12 leaders of the European Union [EU] and 
Boris Yeltsin signed the agreement on partnership and 
cooperation. 
  Emerging from the solemn ceremony into the throng of waiting 
journalists with a smile as dazzling as the sun over this 
stunning Greek island, Boris Nikolayevich gave the following 
reason for that smile: "The agreement is good for us. Because 
it removes Europe's discriminatory approach toward economic ties 
with Russia and thereby averts a new `cold war' -- an economic 
one -- which was looming." 
  I think that we ordinary Russians should share the 
president's joyful satisfaction. Why? 
  First, we have every reason to be proud of the fact that we 
signed this document not as some poor relative who had suddenly 
turned up but as equal partners. True, we were not the first of 
the former brothers from the former Union with whom Europe has 
officially formalized its ties. That was Ukraine. However, for 
Russia, which is now experiencing far from the happiest times in 
relations with its independent [samostiynyy] neighbor, this is 
certainly no cause for sorrow. The laurels that the EU bestowed 
on Ukraine for coming first does not mean that the EU is banking 
on Kravchuk, for whom the agreement undoubtedly was a trump card 
in the election campaign. In the past the EU had quite a few 
criticisms of Kravchuk's economic course. The Europeans were 
also alarmed by the Ukrainian saga over the non-nuclear status. 
But by offering Ukraine partnership and cooperation, the EU 
secured a means of influence over it. The latest example of 
that is the decision adopted on Corfu on the closure of the 
Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station. In addition, the agreement 
with Ukraine does not promise it the degree of equality which is 
envisaged by the agreement with Russia. 
  To be fair it has to be noted that we did not get our 
equality easily. Initially the EC (as it then was) offered us 
something that was more the illusion of equality. 
  Gradually and -- paradoxically as it may seem -- under the 
pressure of our domestic political confusion, the Europeans 
succumbed. But at the talks that were held two substantial 
stumbling blocks remained -- uranium and banks. France, which 
accounts for 60 percent of the stocks of enriched uranium in the 
EU market, was afraid of an "explosive" influx of cheap nuclear 
materials from Russia. Just 10 days before the signing of the 
agreement a compromise was reached whereby Russia's nuclear 
materials were included in the agreement along with other 
commodities while the EU retains the right to use certain 
instruments of commercial protection until 1997. Finally, Boris 
Yeltsin's recent edict lifting the ban on the activity of five 
foreign banks in Russia also removed the final question mark 
over the Greek accord. 
  So what are we getting out of it? 
  In the political sphere our relations with the Europeans are 
moving toward the kind of level that they have with the United 
States and Japan. It is envisaged that the EU and Russia will 
coordinate their positions on the main international questions 
and, if necessary, will put forward joint political initiatives. 
  Then there is the economy. First and foremost, the EU is 
ceasing to consign us to the category of countries with a "state 
trade system" (that provision, incidentally, is absent from the 
agreement with Ukraine). And this means that the opportunities 
for using tough antidumping measures against us are limited. 
  Unfortunately, while accepting certain concessions in the 
trade sphere, our partners remained inflexible on many other 
questions. Europe is still afraid of a "Russian invasion" and 
therefore our fellow citizens will still have to wait in line 
for visas and, having got one and finally reached their desired 
foreign land, they will have to spend a long time looking for 
work. Unfortunately the European Investment Bank, which 
finances major projects including those in the infrastructure, 
remains closed to us. Incidentally, one of the questions at the 
meeting on Corfu was the European program of "grand construction 
projects." This program envisages the construction of 11 
projects within the general European transportation system, such 
as high-speed rail links, combined road and rail links across 
the Alps, and a highway which will link northern Europe and 
southern Greece. The amalgamation of the EU countries' energy 
systems falls into the same category. And even though 
Chancellor Kohl recently expressed in public his dream of the 
time when "it will be possible to board a train in London, cross 
the whole of Europe, and get out in Moscow," that dream remains 
unrealizable at present. We have not been invited to take part 
in those projects. 
  Generally speaking, even though Boris Nikolayevich spoke 
eloquently on Corfu about the fact that "we are opening the door 
wide to peaceful and fruitful contact between our states and 
peoples," that door, albeit a wide one, has not been flung open 
to us -- rather, it is merely ajar. However, that is also 
understandable. After all, in its level and structure the 
Russian economy will long differ from the European economy, 
which means that it will be difficult for us to keep in step 
with "big-league Europe." Nevertheless, that is no cause for 
sorrow. Who said that Europe must mean the EU? Why not strive 
for broad, pan-European cooperation while remembering to keep 
our eyes on the boundless expanses of the CIS. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Pavel Shinkarenko under the "Human Rights" </F>
rubric: "Open Challenge to Humanitarian Principles"] 
  [Text] On 21 June the Republic of Latvia Saeima adopted a 
law on citizenship. This is a legal act of unprecedented 
content which essentially deprives the vast majority of ethnic 
Russians permanently resident in the country of any realistic 
possibility of obtaining Latvian citizenship. 
  "The law contains elements of ethnic discrimination and 
enshrines a principle rejected by international experts -- 
quotas for the naturalization of permanent residents of Latvia, 
which in general terms will not begin until the year 2000," 
Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Federation Foreign 
Ministry Information and Press Department, told ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI. "This means that on the threshold of the 21st century, a 
state which considers itself democratic and governed by the rule 
of law has taken another step aimed at legal discrimination 
against hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of the republic and 
the formation of a multiethnic state." 
  The diplomat believes that official Riga embarked on this 
path long before the adoption of the present law. Immediately 
after acquiring independence it stripped non-indigenous 
residents of citizenship and began to discriminate specifically 
against them in the political, social, economic, and other 
spheres. To this end a whole series of state decisions has been 
adopted. They include the law on elections to the central and 
local organs of power, the law on state service, the law on 
languages, the law on election campaigning, and additions to the 
laws on the entry and residence of foreigners and on the police 
which seriously worsen the situation of hundreds of thousands of 
non-Latvian residents. 
  It goes without saying that this step by the Latvian 
authorities did not go unnoticed elsewhere, especially not in 
Russia. The day after the vote, statements condemning Riga's 
actions were issued by the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry 
and other state organs and public organizations and on Friday 
the Federation Council appealed to the parliaments of the CSCE 
member states. The deputies' appeal notes, among other things, 
that the law was adopted "despite the many protests of the 
international community and regardless of the recommendations of 
the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and a number of international 
experts." Thus, the senators stress, the Latvian authorities 
have "flouted public standards in the human rights sphere." 
  Moscow believes that the governments and public of the 
European countries must prevent Latvia's slide toward aggressive 
nationalism and the emergence of a center of tension in the 
Baltic region. For its part Russia will approach the further 
development of relations with Latvia in the light of the 
situation developing in Latvia over the law on citizenship.

<F P=106> [Article by Manki Ponomarev: "Opponents of a Chemical </F>
Weapons Ban Resort to Old Methods"] 
  [Text] Almost 18 months have now elapsed since the 
international Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons and Their 
Destruction was opened for signing. Since then representatives 
of approximately 160 countries have already signed this document. 
  Work on the convention lasted almost a quarter-century. Very 
complex problems were encountered. Although only three states 
-- the United States, Russia, and Iraq -- officially admitted 
that they possessed chemical weapons, in fact 20-25 countries 
had them. Also, until recently the political climate was not 
disposed to the adoption of an agreement that would have been 
acceptable to all. 
  In the final analysis, however, such a document was 
elaborated. It prohibits everywhere the acquisition, 
development, production, sale, or use of chemical weapons. All 
stocks and also production capacities must be destroyed within 
10 years of the convention's entry into force. Provision is 
made for monitoring of national chemical industry installations 
and for appropriate inspections to be conducted on a permanent 
basis, as well as inspections on demand, when any country is 
obliged to give foreign observers access to installations which 
have come under suspicion. 
  According to the terms of the convention, it will come into 
force once ratified by 65 participant states. This is expected 
to happen next year. At present, however, the ratification 
process is proceeding slowly. Just five countries have 
confirmed in legislation their adhesion to this act of 
international law. It is perfectly obvious that the majority of 
countries are waiting for it to be ratified by Russia and the 
United States. 
  In Russia the State Duma has now begun examining the 
convention, and preparations are under way to ratify it. The 
document is also being discussed in the U.S. Senate. Hearings 
on ratification of the chemical weapons convention were held 
recently in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The 
Administration's representatives at the hearings -- James 
Woolsey, director of the CIA; General John Shalikashvili, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and John Holum, director 
of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency -- pointed out that 
this international document, which prohibits an entire class of 
mass destruction weapons, meets U.S. national security interests. 
  On the whole the senators listened favorably to the 
Administration representatives. But it is no secret that there 
are also opponents of the convention in the United States. It 
can hardly be considered a coincidence that on the eve of the 
hearings the U.S. press launched a new campaign of accusations 
against Russia, which is allegedly "concealing its efforts" to 
develop the latest types of chemical weapons, including binary 
weapons. 
  THE NEW YORK TIMES has shown special zeal. It has repeatedly 
addressed this topic in the past few days. At the same time, 
not possessing any facts, since none exists, it has returned to 
the long-refuted "revelations" of the Russian chemical scientist 
Vil Mirzayanov in his sensational interview with THE BOSTON 
GLOBE. True, in passing, it made the reservation that "some of 
his frightening statements elicit a skeptical attitude." But 
this was only a reservation. 
  As far as it is possible to judge, the majority of U.S. 
congressmen still incline toward ratifying the convention. The 
speediest positive examination of this problem in our State Duma 
would obviously make a favorable impression on them. Although 
it would be perfectly legitimate to put the question this way: 
Ratification of the convention on chemical weapons in the U.S. 
Senate would also prompt Russian legislators to make such a 
decision.

<F P=106> [Video report from north Caucasus by correspondent Andrey </F>
Murtazin, including recording of remarks at news conference by 
Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of Russian Federation 
Council -- from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] The situation in the Ossetian-Ingush conflict zone 
is gradually stabilizing without any particular interference by, 
and sometimes in spite of, the federal authorities. This was 
the conclusion of Ramazan Abdulatipov, who recently visited the 
northern Caucasus. The deputy chairman of the Federation 
Council regards the main success of his mission as the agreement 
signed in Beslan by the presidents of Northern Ossetia and 
Ingushetia on the procedure for returning refugees and settling 
them in four villages of Prigorodnyy rayon. It was there, two 
years ago, that the Ossetian-Ingush conflict broke out, which 
resulted in the death of over 300 people and in about 800 people 
becoming refugees. In practice, Ruslan Aushev and Akhsarbek 
Galazov guaranteed the safe return of the civilian population to 
Prigorodnyy rayon and their living as close communities in the 
villages of Chermen, Dachnoye, Dongaron, and Kurtat. 
  Abdulatipov said that the main problem now is the lack of 
funds to build houses to replace those burned down. For 
example, the republic has only received 800 million of the 90 
billion roubles of capital investment planned for Ingushetia. 
In order to extricate the rayon from the condition it has been 
in since the war, there needs, at least, to be a clear policy on 
the Caucasus which, unfortunately, is lacking at the moment. 
  [Abdulatipov] Policy itself, including and particularly 
policy on the Caucasus, must be able to be assessed and 
implemented stage by stage. Otherwise, we could go on for a 
hundred years talking about this.

  [Text] Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of the 
Federation Council, said at a news conference today that none of 
the 37 points of the government plan to eliminate the 
consequences of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict have been 
implemented. He noted that the necessary financial assistance 
for Ingushetia and North Ossetia have not yet been received by 
the warring parties. Not a single refugee has been able to 
return back home. At the same time, Abdulatipov said that 
according to the results of criminal investigations, up to 1,000 
criminal cases have been lodged in the conflict zone. He 
believes that Russia's uncertain policy toward Chechnya, as well 
as the absence of any coherent concept with regard to the north 
Caucasian region, plays a destabilizing role in the north 
Caucasus. The deputy chairman of the Federation Council intends 
to appeal to Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of government, to 
accelerate the settlement of the problems stemming from the 
Ossetian-Ingush conflict.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Bulygin: "Kuban `Illegals'"] </F>
  [Text] Krasnodar -- Krasnodar is gradually turning from a 
communist bastion into a testing ground where interregional 
policy can be tried out. And not by waving a magic wand, but by 
implementing Kuban's status as a special zone. It is no 
accident that Russians are interested in the processes under way 
here, and the local authorities, while divulging their 
experience in dribs and drabs, are improving on it and borrowing 
innovations from others. Graphic evidence of that is provided 
by the recent holding in Krasnodar Kray of a session of the 
council of the Association for Socioeconomic Cooperation among 
the Republics, Krays, and Oblasts of the North Caucasus, the 
conference of heads of organs of state power in the south of 
Russia, Abkhazia, and the Crimea, the all-Russia scientific and 
practical conference "Local Self-Government and Regional 
Economic Practice in the New Political and Economic Situation," 
and the second international "Partnership for Progress" 
conference. The interest in discussing purely economic and 
managerial problems leaves no time for any political statements, 
while the cards-on-the-table attitude displayed in the latest 
moves are disarming the opposition in the shape of those who 
love political intrigues. 
  Thus, a signing ceremony and an exchange of texts of 
treaties 
of friendship and cooperation between the Kuban and the Republic 
of Ingushetia has taken place in the presence of journalists. 
[Ingushetia President] Ruslan Aushev's comment was that people 
still engage in politics even when they are living badly. The 
president of Ingushetia shared his faith in the republic's 
economic prosperity. But this is something that can only be 
dreamed about for the time being. Currently more than half of 
the local able-bodied population is unemployed. It was the 
search for investment that brought the president to Krasnodar. 
And he wanted to check his position against what his neighbors 
had achieved so as to make use of their experience in preparing 
a document on the creation of an economic development zone [zona 
ekonomicheskogo blagopriyatstvovaniya] in the republic. 
  Russian Federation components are not doing any the worse 
for 
being harnessed together. A wide range of issues regarding the 
general agreement between the Russian Government and the regions 
was examined at the Association's council session -- on the 
development of the program for a unified transport system for 
the North Caucasus, and on economic cooperation and the 
provision of epidemiological safety in southern regions. The 
Kuban and the Crimea have also agreed to jointly build a bridge 
over the Kerch Strait. 
  The returns on many projects will only be visible in the 
future. But it is also important that they have not been 
dictated from on high but are being implemented according to the 
plans of the new leaders and entourages that have arrived at 
local level. These people came up with the initiative to set up 
the Association, which is reviving centuries-old interregional 
ties and establishing new ones. Any country or region can 
become a member of the socioeconomic commonwealth, and actual 
membership of the Association does not mean recognizing the 
independence of certain regions. 
  The discussion at the scientific and practical conference of 
the problems of distributing functions between the federal and 
local authorities, and of ties between the regions and the 
center and organs of local self-government was also dictated by 
life. Mayor Valeriy Samoylenko of Krasnodar noted in this 
connection: "There is a kind of situation in society whereby 
policy is still made in the capitals, while the economics is 
done -- or not done -- at local level. Organs of local 
self-government are now coming in for the greatest pressure from 
the population. They have become a kind of lightning rod at a 
time of socioeconomic tension".... 
  The kinds of bolts that are hitting the "lightning rod" 
were explained by Ilya Demenko, general director of the kray 
administration's Finance, Budget, and Control Department. 
  "Under the Russian president's edict, the regions themselves 
should be concerned about supplying the population with bread. 
The Kuban is the country's breadbasket, and you would have 
thought that this task could have been resolved here without any 
particular bother. But the question arises: Where will the 
billions of rubles to buy grain for the agrarian sector come 
from, if kray, city, and rayon budgets are all out of kilter? 
This has been a stumbling block when it comes to solving other 
problems too. Politicians provide payments from federal pockets 
on the basis of population sizes, but the central authorities 
use as their basis obsolete figures that take no account of 
migration processes...." 
  The governor of the Kuban has signed a decree beefing up the 
pre-existing norms for controlling resettlement. People will 
now only be able to come here to live on receipt of official 
invitations issued by local administrations. Residence permits 
continue to be the main mechanism for regulating migration for 
the time being. Were they to be abolished, other levers would 
be sought. The kray administration has already passed a decree 
on the recruitment and utilization of foreign labor in the Kuban 
under license. In order to close off channels for illegal 
immigration it has been decided to set up a special center from 
where illegals will be resettled in other parts of Russia. 
These enforced measures have become possible thanks to the 
Kuban's being granted special status as a Federation component. 
The kray is indeed special. It not only enjoys a favorable 
climate, but has become a Russian border region and the 
country's southern gateway to the Mediterranean and the Near 
East. This means that this is the place where bridges of 
economic cooperation should also be built with the states of 
Europe and America.

<F P=106> [Report by INFORM-KURANTY: "Kazan -- Capital of National </F>
Socialism?"] 
  [Text] Quite unexpectedly, a new brown-hued Russian 
National Socialist Workers Party [RNSWP] has been set up in 
Kazan. Black-shirted toughs, however, have for a couple of 
years now been part of the Volga political landscape. Those in 
the know will remember that the present founding fathers of the 
RNSWP wore the same uniforms during the ceremony to meet S. 
Terekhov, who arrived in Kazan last year. Thirty activists of 
the brown movement led by Mikhail Glukhov, an important local 
figure of national socialism, have now come down to organize a 
party on the basis of strict ideas of national revival. As a 
matter of fact, these ideas are constantly drifting from 
Barkashov to Terekhov and on to Zhirinovskiy: the revival of a 
healthy nation, a strong dictatorial state of general 
prosperity, control by the government apparatus over all the 
main means of production. 
  Incidentally, Kazan "Glukhovites" (their leader, they 
maintain, was running for the Duma not without a measure of 
success) disprove the proposition about a unified red-and-brown 
front because they parade as the most hardboiled 
anti-communists. Will this be for long? Experience shows that 
in minutes crucial and confused extremists' flanks start to draw 
closer together.

"`Siberian Agreement' Enhances Its Status. Now It Is Better 
Positioned To Take Part in the Allocation of Money From the 
Federal Budget"] 
  [Text] The council of the "Siberian Agreement" 
Interregional Association, which includes representatives of 
legislative and executive authorities of 19 Federation 
components, ended its meeting 26 June at the village of 
Listvyanka on Lake Baykal. The meeting was attended by the 
chairmen of the Federal Assembly chambers and members of the 
Russian Government. The meeting's main result was the 
ratification of the General Agreement between the government and 
organizations ensuring Russia's economic coordination. 
According to Sergey Shakhray, "chiefs of Siberian regions 
managed to make significant headway in solving the problems of 
economic coordination." 
  In particular, the General Agreement gives the economic 
associations the right to take part in the consideration of the 
draft federal budget and the taxation policy program with regard 
to the regions. In addition, the territories were granted the 
right to set up their own banking networks. The General 
Agreement points out the need to adjust the Law on the Central 
Bank taking into account the interests of Russian Federation 
components. "Siberian Agreement" experts will from now on be 
involved in the preparation of draft laws and other enforceable 
enactments by Federation Council committees. 
  Association chiefs were tasked with resolving together with 
the central authorities the problem of setting tariffs for 
electric power and railway transport. The meeting also approved 
the draft law "On the Environmental-Economic Region of Altay," 
the creation of the "Sibagromash," and backed the idea of 
forming a food market in the region in 1994.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Ovcharov: "Farmers Considered People in </F>
Yaroslavl"] 
  [Text] Yaroslavl -- Yaroslav Oblast Governor Anatoliy 
Lisitsyn has published a decree on support for private farmers. 
  In particular, there will now be a separate entry in the 
budget for the allocation of credit resources to the Association 
of Peasant (Private) Farms; these credits will represent 15 
percent of the total monetary resources allocated for the 
development of the agroindustrial complex. No less than 15 
percent of capital investments going into the social 
construction programs in the countryside (irrespective of the 
sources of funding) will be directed toward private farmers. 
Henceforth one-tenth of all the resources spent on road 
construction in the oblast will also go to private farmers. It 
has been decided to halve the level of paid services for testing 
agricultural produce brought into the city by private farmers.

  [Text] Birobidzhan, 28 Jun -- The first "Cover" [Zaslon] 
operation carried out in central Amur has provided the 
opportunity to "cleanse" Russian territorial waters of Chinese 
poachers. Border guards at the Birobidzhan detachment, guarding 
nearly 500 km of waters along the border with the PRC, prevented 
over 100 border violations in the first week of the operation. 
About 2 km of floating and fixed gill nets have been 
confiscated along with hundreds of meters of hooked tackle. 
Sixteen of the most hardened Chinese poachers were detained. 
After registration of the incidents of poaching, the culprits 
were handed to the Chinese authorities. 
  ITAR-TASS was told by Mikhail Naymilo, head of the 
detachment, that "the Amur these days is practically clean." 
After an official statement to Chinese border representatives, 
the Chinese border patrols, the river police, and the fish 
patrol inspectors stepped up their activities noticeably. 
Before Operation Cover went ahead, none of these departments 
even attempted to halt the intensified poaching by their 
compatriots.

<F P=106> [Report by Natalya Ostrovskaya: "Barge Reprocesses Nuclear </F>
Waste"] 
  [Text] Vladivostok -- The scandalously notorious liquid 
radioactive waste formed during the process of breaking up 
Pacific Fleet submarines will be reprocessed using a mobile 
floating complex of the barge type. This decision was made by 
the Russian-Japanese commission working in Vladivostok and 
Maritime Kray, which for 18 months has been closely involved in 
looking for ways to resolve the problems of the fleet's liquid 
radioactive waste. 
  IZVESTIYA has already reported (11 May 1994) that two 
options 
were examined at previous stages of the commission's work. 
Apart from the barge, the possibility of constructing a 
shore-based reprocessing complex was also entertained. But 
independent experts from the British consulting firm Crown 
Enterprises have calculated that the "floating" option is both 
cheaper and more practical. It is well known that a number of 
bases on the coast of Maritime Kray are associated with the 
so-called waste disposal ship division of the Pacific Fleet. It 
is these ships which the barge will "service." 
  Another reason why the floating complex was chosen to 
recycle 
liquid radioactive waste was the clear displeasure of the 
inhabitants of the city of Bolshoy Kamen, where the main base 
for breaking up nuclear submarines is located -- the "Zvezda" 
defense plant. This was the planned site of the shore-based 
complex. For the same reason of local discontent the tanker 
TNT-5 with hundreds of cubic meters of liquid radioactive waste 
on board was relocated at the end of May from Bolshoy Kamen to 
Pavlovskogo Bay, where it stands to this day. 
  The skill with which military men have been able to move 
around a ship that was written off long ago and is overloaded 
with a politically dangerous cargo is amazing. After all, back 
in spring Maritime Kray Administration announced there was a 
danger of the old tanker sinking spontaneously and liquid 
radioactive waste discharging accidentally into the bay. 
  Now however, after another stage of work by the 
Russian-Japanese commission, Yevgeniy Stomatyuk, chairman of the 
kray committee for natural resources, announced that this 
notorious liquid radioactive waste is a very insignificant part 
of the radiation danger that actually exists on the kray's 
territory at the present time. And in announcing this, he cited 
the existing ban on shipping solid radioactive waste out of 
Maritime Kray via the Trans-Siberian Railroad. 
  Nevertheless, despite all this, environmentally concerned 
Japan is still prepared to donate some of the money earmarked by 
its government for Russian disarmament to the plan for 
constructing a complex to process liquid radioactive waste. The 
commission calculates that three-four weeks will be spent 
finalizing the documentation and conditions of tender -- an 
international auction-cum-investors' meeting which will specify 
a firm that is capable of implementing the plan to construct the 
floating complex at a realistically low price and taking into 
account all Russian and international environmental safety 
requirements. 
  Applications to participate in the tender have already been 
received from 20 firms and companies, mainly from Japan and the 
United States. Not one of these firms is Russian, unfortunately.

  [Text] The Russian State Duma Committee on Economic Policy 
and the administration of the Sakhalin Region have agreed to 
draft a law on Sakhalin providing for the establishment of a 
special economic zone on a part of the region's territory, 
Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Economic Policy Sergey 
Glazyev said in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk when meeting with 
representatives of the local executive and legislative bodies. 
  Glazyev said that the administration could be given the 
right 
to set quotas for fishing independently immediately without 
waiting for the law to be adopted. However, Glazyev stressed 
that enlargement of rights must be followed by greater 
responsibility of the local authorities for the utilization of 
natural resources and for investments into the social 
infrastructure.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "When Freedom Is Too Much For You"] </F>
  [Text] State regulation of the timber industry has been 
reintroduced in Buryatia by decision of the republic Council of 
Ministers. The republic government was forced into taking this 
step by the critical situation in this sector, which was rapidly 
privatized two years ago. 
  The newfound freedom turned out to be a heavy burden for the 
15 joint-stock companies formed on the basis of the Transbaykal 
region's timber procurement establishments. Their output proved 
uncompetitive not only in the world market but also in the 
Russian market, as its prime cost is greater than those of its 
nearest rivals in Siberia. 
  Nevertheless, the Government of Buryatia's decision does not 
signal a return to the administrative economic management of the 
sector. The "Lesopromyshlennaya Kompaniya `Zabaykalles'" state 
enterprise will only be a coordinating body. Its main task is 
to coordinate interests of the republic and the joint-stock 
companies and to create a scientifically and economically based 
model of investment in the Transbaykal region's timber industry.

<F P=106> [Interview with acting President Leonid Kravchuk by Enrico </F>
Franceschini; place and date not given: "Leonid Kravchuk Seeks 
Reelection by Wooing Communists: `The Worst Is Over'"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- Leonid Kravchuk's fellow citizens say of 
him: "He could walk in the rain and not get wet, by dodging the 
raindrops." In politics, this "agility" has enabled him to 
slide from one ideology to another without losing face -- or not 
too much, at least. The Ukrainian Houdini has elevated the 
quick-change act to an art: Secretary of the Communist Party 
Central Committee until 1991, he did not say a word in defense 
of Gorbachev during the time of the attempted "August coup"; but 
after the coup failed he sided with the Ukrainian independence 
movement and was elected president by a landslide vote a few 
months later . Now he is seeking reelection by flirting with 
the communists (he appointed one of them prime minister), but he 
is also wooing the moderate nationalists. A man for all seasons 
who has the good fortune always to appear like the "lesser 
evil," helped by the absence of worthy alternative candidates 
and by an unscrupulous exploitation of power. 
  [Franceschini] During your two-and-a-half years as president 
Ukraine has plummeted into an abyss. Do you not feel 
responsible? 
  [Kravchuk] I disagree. Only those who do nothing make no 
mistakes. We have made some, but we have also done a great deal 
-- building from nothing an independent state, without wars or 
disasters, with democratic structures and its own Armed Forces, 
earning the respect of the international community. The worst 
is over. We have a long way to go, but we are on course, and in 
two or three years' time everything will be resolved. 
  [Franceschini] Are you in favor of forming a Slavic 
confederation between Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, as some 
people have been suggesting recently? 
  [Kravchuk] It is a dangerous idea. It could spark a tide of 
pan-Slavism and nationalism from Eastern Europe to Kazakhstan, 
in all the countries where millions of Slavs live. It is 
impossible to create unions on the basis of the ethnic-national 
principle. But we do want to have good relations with Russia, 
especially in the economic field. 
  [Franceschini] Crimea and East Ukraine, where 10 million 
Russians live, are pressing to return to Russia's orbit. Could 
this prompt a conflict between Moscow and Kiev? 
  [Kravchuk] Russia and Ukraine have lived together for 350 
years, have never taken up arms against each other, and will 
never do so. To resolve the issue of Crimea's autonomy we will 
not resort to force under any circumstances. We are in favor of 
a peaceful solution of the problem, and I think we are moving in 
this direction. 
  [Franceschini] Will Ukraine sign the nuclear 
nonproliferation 
treaty and thus pledge to consign its arsenal to Russia? 
  [Kravchuk] With me as president, the treaty will be 
immediately submitted to Parliament for ratification as soon as 
possible. It is an essential duty that we have taken on with 
respect to the international community.

<F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Leonid Kuchma by </F>
Enrico Franceschini; place and date not given: "Challenger: 
`Europe, Help Us'"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- As small as [President] Kravchuk is massive, 
Leonid Kuchma has based his election campaign on the defense of 
the rights of the huge Russian minority and on the support of 
the communists, for whom Ukraine's Russians vote almost 
unanimously. But if there is one label that sticks to him well, 
it is "missile man": For 20 years, until 1992, he was director 
of the world's largest strategic missile factory, at 
Dnepropetrovsk in central Ukraine. For this reason he enjoys 
the support of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex and has 
adopted a tougher line than his rival on possession of the 1,800 
nuclear missiles left in Ukraine after the end of the USSR. 
  [Franceschini] Would you have Parliament sign the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty? 
  [Kuchma] If elected president, I will not press for a 
ratification vote. Ukraine's signing of that treaty depends on 
the honoring of the promises made to us by the United States and 
Russia: We were supposed to receive a billion dollars for 
dismantling the nuclear devices, but we have not yet seen a 
single cent or kopeck. So far we have heard nothing but words. 
When we see deeds, we will talk about the treaty again. 
  [Franceschini] What do you expect from Europe? 
  [Kuchma] Specific measures to cooperate with us, to show us 
what kind of Ukraine you want to have as a partner. Europe must 
realize that 90 percent of Ukrainians live in conditions of 
extreme poverty and that tragic events could happen here, as in 
the former Yugoslavia. 
  [Franceschini] What would your policy toward Russia be? 
  [Kuchma] Some 80 percent of our economy is integrated with 
Russia's. This alone is enough to explain why we need an 
economic union with Moscow. Ukraine must be not a cordon 
sanitaire between Russia and the rest of Europe, but a bridge 
between East and West. We are bound to Russia by thousands of 
historical and cultural ties. Conflict with Russia is solely to 
our detriment. Our two states are bound to maintain a close 
partnership -- like the United States and Canada, for instance. 
  [Franceschini] Are you in favor of the privatization of the 
economy? 
  [Kuchma] Yes, but privatization must be carried out under 
strict state control, otherwise it will merely serve to increase 
the wealth of the mafia's structures, which are already closely 
bound to our bureaucratic apparatus. Furthermore, it is 
necessary to allocate special funds to research, culture, and 
the poorest classes, starting with an increase in pensions. 
  [Franceschini] What is your vision of the Ukraine of 
tomorrow? 
  [Kuchma] A state in which those who work honestly can aspire 
to a better life than those who steal and waste the state's 
assets.

  Ukraine has always attached great significance to friendly 
relations with Cuba, and these traditional links should serve as 
a sure foundation for the development of trade, economic, and 
cultural relations betwen our countries, Zlenko emphasized. 
  Cuba considers Ukraine to be a friend, Soto observed. We

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature, compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] According to election commissions in constituencies 
in the presidential election on June 26 9 million 87 thousand 
995 voters (38 percent) cast their ballots for the incumbent, 
Leonid Kravchuk, and 8 million 221 thousand 515 (32) percent, 
for ex-Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma. 
  A total of 25 million 800 voters took part in the 
presidential election. 
  Under the Ukrainian law if neither candidate collects 50 
percent of the votes at once, the two top candidates qualify for 
a run-off. 
  The central electoral commission is going to set a date for 
the election of the Ukrainian president later this week. The 
run-off is to be held no later than two weeks after the first 
round. 
  The chief of the presidential service Vladimir 
Shlyaposhnikov 
has told IF that Kravchuk's victory was not a surprise. As for 
the complete failure of the ex-speaker Ivan Plyushch, who 
according to early returns holds sixth place, it was totally 
unexpected. The returns from the first round of the 
presidential election in Ukraine are evidence that neither 
candidate is regarded as a a consolidating figure and that the 
trend of Ukraine's split along geographic and political lines 
goes on. The West voted for Kravchuk, and the East for Kuchma, 
the chairman of the State Duma's Committee for the CIS affairs 
and contacts with compatriots Konstantin Zatulin has said. He 
led the Russian parliament's observer delegation monitoring the 
election. 
  He believes that irrespective of the results of the run-off 
it is clear that Kravchuk has lost the status of the national 
leader. 
  Zatulin has described the relatively high percentage of 
votes 
cast for Kuchma as his major success, emphasized by the fact 
that the entire state machinery worked against him throughout 
the election campaign. 
  Zatulin pointed to the fact that in contrast to the 
parliamentary elections the presidential election was attended 
by far fewer international observers, which may lead to election 
rigging. Zatulin said that by not sending their observers the 
Western countries gave Leonid Kravchuk and the party in power in 
Ukraine a chance to influence the outcome of the elections.

  [Text] Kiev, 28 Jun -- "I am not yet president and so many 
people have already gathered," said Ukrainian presidential 
candidate Leonid Kuchma opening a news conference on the results 
of the first round of the elections. 
  A representative of the presidential candidate's team at the 
news conference said the outcome of the first round demonstrated 
that "the new course proposed by Kuchma enjoys popularity among 
the people." The candidate himself added: "It also shows that 
most of the other deputies are using none other than my program 
in the preelection contest." 
  Leonid Kuchma underscored that opportunities to use the 
state 
mass media in the preelection campaign were not equal. Asked 
about his own use of the private mass media in Donetsk and Kiev 
and his appearance on Ostankino TV, Mr. Kuchma replied that 
"Leonid Kravchuk did it on a much larger scale". 
  The outcome of the election in Crimea was described by Mr. 
Kuchma as crucial. There, as we know, over 83 percent of the 
electorate voted in favor of his candidacy. "Crimea has proved 
to be an absolutely normal part of Ukraine," Leonid Kuchma said. 
  "My aim is not winning. My aim is, under the conditions of 
an information blockade, communicating to the public at large my 
own views and opinions on the situation in the state," Leonid 
Kuchma concluded.

<F P=106> [Report by Volodymyr Skachko: "They Voted for the State"] </F>
  [Text] At the 26 June elections, not only did the entire 
adult population of Ukraine vote for a new president, but also 
for 11,440 chairmen of local councils and 165,000 people's 
deputies at all levels. Tentative data indicate that 68.4 
percent of the electorate (more than 25 million people) 
participated in the elections, and, consequently, the elections 
are valid. 
  Final results regarding individual people are still being 
summarized, but it cannot be ruled out that there will be the 
second round of both presidential and local elections, but one 
can already discuss certain trends. First, the activity of 
those who came to more than 30,000 polling stations indicates 
that the people in Ukraine are still interested in renewing the 
power at all levels. Second, compared with the parliamentary 
elections, the activity of the people abated, even though its 
main pattern has remained: The voting was more active in the 
West, more passive in the south, and the center showed the 
"golden mean." As before, the capital added its "negative" 
touch -- less than 52 percent of the electorate voted in Kiev. 
  Third, only final results will show which political forces 
and where prevailed, but it may already be asserted that the 
very fact of elections that have taken place indicates that, 
despite the possible sharp political regionalization (the "left 
wing" in the east and south and the "right wing" in the west), 
no one spoke against the existence of the Ukrainian state. 
  The dissimilar political preferences are nothing but 
indications that there exist dissimilar visions of the 
approaches to building both the local and general state order. 
Therefore, the main task of official Kiev is to find such a 
model of state building as would balance out the political 
differences. This is precisely the case when the general state 
consensus must be based on values common to all people. For 
example, political confrontation must be abandoned for the sake 
of overcoming crisis phenomena and improving the standard of 
living of the people. There may be dissimilar roads to this in 
different areas. 
  Yet another conspicuous (at least in words) characteristic 
of 
these elections was the fact that none of the presidential 
candidates spoke about excessive politicization. On the 
contrary, everyone spoke about the building of such an 
independent state, which must be underlain by a sound economy. 
At the polling stations in Kiev where Ukrainian presidential 
candidates spoke, we managed to record ideas of some of them 
about the main principles of our state's existence. We offer 
them for your attention. 
  L. Kravchuk (on the main result of the election campaign and 
private ownership): "I visited many regions and became 
convinced that the people want to have their own state. It is 
true that the people disagree with leaders and their policy, but 
they are not against the statehood. Nor do they, incidentally, 
oppose private ownership, as some people maintain. If a citizen 
wants to have his private property, let him have it. It is only 
necessary to specify its status, rights of ownership, and the 
mechanism for its protection. There will be no democracy 
without [private] ownership. If a person is not free 
economically and if he cannot freely use his property or the 
results of his work, there will be no democratic development." 
  I. Plyushch (on proposals with regard to a Slavic 
conference): "It cannot be done the way they want. It takes 
years to do such things, they must be allowed to ripen. We have 
not even ultimately divided the Union, but are already trying to 
create something else. We must bring the previous process to its 
logical completion, create a CIS market, and then, possibly, 
create something new. Radical measures are only proposed when 
one wants to do harm to someone." 
  L. Kuchma (on Ukraine's future): "Ukraine needs new 
technologies and new equipment. Everything else is mere talk. 
Ukraine does not need philanthropic assistance. Europe and 
America must proceed from this and must determine what kind of 
Ukraine they want to see: economically strong or something else. 
  "I was asked about my first steps in case I am elected 
president. I answer: Everybody must feel that a real master has 
appeared in Ukraine and that the situation, which prevails 
today, when nobody heeds others, must end." 
  V. Lanovyy (on governing the state): "The main thing is to 
have local self-government so that those leaders who receive 
powers would be answerable. It is not so important whether 
these are left or right-wing forces. They have received their 
mandates and will be under the control of those people who 
elected them and may recall them. 
  "I am in favor of having presidential representatives in the 
provinces, representatives who supervise the fulfillment of the 
general state legislation. However, in addition to that, we 
must constitutionally approve restrictions to the legislative 
powers of local councils. If there are no such restrictions, 
other regions may follow in the footsteps of the Crimea." 
  Other leaders also care and will care about strengthening 
the 
Ukrainian state and, therefore, these elections have constituted 
yet another step toward crystallizing the Ukrainian political 
elite whose absence is anyone's talk.

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Stetsyuk for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Sevastopol June 29 TASS -- The results of elections 
of the city mayor and deputies to the Sevastopol City Council 
were discussed at a session of the Electoral Commission on 
Tuesday. The mandates won by 50 deputies and chairman of the 
executive committee Viktor Semenov were recognised valid. 
  Viktor Semenov, in his first address as the city mayor, said 
that the new power would be tough and its goal would be to 
improve the life of city residents. Semenov pledged to suspend 
the activities of the Ukrainian president's mission in 
Sevastopol on the very first day when the newly elected city 
council comes into office, saying that organs of state 
administration would begin to operate in accordance with a 
regime of the executive committee of the city council of 
people's deputies. 
  Semenov intends to put problems, pertaining to the 
possibility of Sevastopol's integration into the Crimean common 
economic space, on the agenda of the first session of the city 
council. In this connection, the city council shall appeal to 
the president and the parliament of the autonomous republic in 
order to apply the banking, currency and customs policy pursued 
by the Crimean authorities, on the city's territory. 
  The new mayor intends to endorse the city's emblem and its 
anthem at the first session of the city council.

  [Text] Kiev [No date as received] -- The Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry's press service reports that Army General Vitaliy 
Radetskyy, minister of defense, is on a working visit to the 
Odessa military district. In particular he learned about the

  Ukraine's defense minister familiarized himself with the 
training of personnel for the summer education period which is

preparation of premises and the entire housing stock for winter. 
  On the same day the Ukrainian defense minister visited the 
Donetsk military school where the final, 25th graduation will

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Viktor Kovalenko for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev June 29 TASS -- The Ukrainian parliament 
endorsed amendments "To the Ukrainian law on local bodies of 
power and local government" on Tuesday by 216 votes. The law 
was recently turned down by the Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk and returned to the Ukrainian parliament for amendment. 
  Lawmakers approved amendments to three key articles of the 
law. Now, the law bans deputies of local councils from 
membership in executive committees of corresponding councils. 
The law says that the activities of a local council may be 
suspended only by the Ukrainian parliament on a request from the 
president, the Cabinet of Ministers or a superior corresponding 
council. Thus, the law prevents people's deputies from local 
councils to concurrently occupy several posts in local bodies of 
power, while bodies of local government can be disbanded in case 
of the violation of the legislation.

<F P=106> [Report by UNIAN correspondent Anatoliy Drobyazko: "The </F>
Dollar Comes and Goes, Whereas the Karbovanets Is Always in 
Demand"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Your Money or Your Life? </H5>
  Ukraine's National Bank on 18 June set an official exchange 
rate for the U.S. dollar -- 17,500 karbovantsi [K] for $1, which 
is K1,000 higher than the preceding rate (of 8 June). In this 
way, the exchange rate of the karbovanets continues to be 
smoothly regulated and brought closer (although not really fast 
enough) to the true rate of exchange prevailing on the market. 
At the same time, last week revealed a quite interesting trend: 
When the exchange rate of the karbovanets was carefully set at 
an unreasonably low level, its exchange rate with regard to the 
dollar fell increasingly deeper, but, as soon as the National 
Bank started lowering the rate, a different phenomenon began to 
be observed on the market. 
  On the currency cash market, for example, the position of 
the 
karbovanets became somewhat more steady from 10-17 June -- both 
with regard to hard currencies and the Russian ruble. By way of 
example, the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar ranged at purchase 
between K45,500 and K46,500 for $1 and at sale between K46,400 
and K48,000 for $1. This is on average 2 percent lower than 
what the dollar cost last week. The rate of the Russian ruble 
ranged between K21,000 and K22,600 (at purchase) and between 
K22,500 and K25,000 (at sale) and decreased by comparison with 
the last week's rate by between 2.8 and 4.7 percent. The German 
mark cost at purchase between K26,900 and K27,800 and at sale 
between K27,600 and K29,000 -- in other words, it showed over a 
week trends characteristic of the U.S. dollar. 
  The Ukrainian karbovanets also gained strength at the 
exchanges of the CIS countries. For example, at the Minsk 
currency exchange, the rate of the karbovanets grew from 0.58 
Belarusian rubles for K1 on 8 June to 0.68 Belarusian rubles for 
K1 on 16 June. Thus, the cross rate of the cashless Ukrainian 
karbovanets with regard to the U.S. dollar constitutes in Minsk 
K39,411.8 for $1. At the Moscow Interbank currency exchange, 
the rate of the karbovanets grew from 4.30 Russian rubles [R] 
for K100 on 8 June to R4.55 for K100 on 17 June. The cross rate 
of the cashless Ukrainian karbovanets at the Moscow Interbank 
currency exchange with regard to the U.S. dollar constituted in 
the final analysis K43,142.9 for $1. 
  What factors affected the currency market? 
  The currency dealers continued their speculation toward 
lowering the exchange rate of hard currencies. The fact that 
the rate is in the zone of resistance is indicated by the low 
activity of market entrepreneurs, but the quite steady fall in 
the rate of the U.S. dollar is a matter of concern for owners of 
small amounts of cash. This may be accounted for by the 
continued situation associated with the destabilization of the 
currency market at the end of May. Expectations of inflation 
also continue to intensify as a result of introducing into 
circulation of the K200,000 banknote. In addition to that, as 
is known, a decision was adopted on the procedure for issuing 
credits for agricultural work and on the size of credits, and 
this may lead to a 10-percent rise in the rate of the U.S. 
dollar as soon as at the beginning of July. 
  A certain counterbalance to these negative factors is, to 
some extent, an improvement in the liquidity indexes of 
commercial banks, which is associated with the present reserved 
policy pursued by Ukraine's National Bank, the introduction of 
the system of electronic settlements, and, as a consequence, a 
sharp rise in the circulation of capital, the appearance of a 
surplus of free credit resources, and a decrease in bank 
interest rates. Besides, with the beginning of the vacation 
season, the turnover on the currency market has increased due to 
the natural migration of people. However, if the exchange rate 
of the dollar continues to be low, then, everything considered, 
it will be more profitable to sell dollars for rubles directly 
in Russia.

  [Text] Chernobyl [no date as received] -- A meeting of the 
Supreme Council Commission for issues of nuclear policy and 
nuclear safety was held at the Chernobyl AES yesterday. It 
discussed the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power stations. 
  Leaders from Ukraine's National Academy of Sciences, the 
State Atomic Inspectorate, Ukraine's State Atomic Committee, 
directors of nuclear power stations, and enterprises of the 
nuclear industry took part in the commission's work. 
  Having noted the positive tendencies in raising the safety 
of 
Ukrainian nuclear power stations, above all, the Chernobyl AES, 
the meeting's participants concentrated on the present problems 
of which there are many because of the imperfections of state 
tariffs. Nuclear power stations are working at a loss: The 
Ukrainian Ministry of Energy's national dispatching station pays 
the AES only 200 karbovantsi for 1 kWh, the cost price of which 
is 750 karbovantsi. But even at this price, the nuclear 
industry's debts reached two trillion karbovantsi. Because of 
the shortage of funds, repair and preventative inspection work 
is being disrupted and therefore the safe working of the AES is 
not guaranteed. There is a real threat that up to five 
generating sets each with a capacity of one million kW could be 
shut down. 
  In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Mykola 
Pavlovskyy, chairman of the [Nuclear Policy and Safety] 
Commission, said that its priority task would be to prepare and 
adopt a law on the use of nuclear energy as soon as possible, 
and in the future to create an effective legislative base on the 
basis of which nuclear power engineering will develop.

<F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Alyaksandr Lukashenka </F>
by Mikhail Rudkowski on 28 June; place not given -- recorded, in 
Russian] 
  [Text] [Lukashenka] Today, escorted by official 
bodyguards provided to me by the Internal Affairs Ministry and 
accompanied by a motorcade, I went to my office at the House of 
Government. At the entrance, I was met by a colonel and 
lieutenant colonel. Having introduced themselves, they informed 
me that Internal Affairs Minister Danko had left orders that I 
not be allowed into the House of Government and my office. This 
was a scandalous violation of the Constitution and our nation's 
laws, [words indistinct] the law on the status of people's 
deputy. I told them about this. Escorted by the group of 
bodyguards officially assigned to me, as well as one unofficial 
bodyguard, I entered the House of Government. At the first 
guard post in the right wing, I was met by a group of militia 
officers; at least they were in uniforms, and there were eight 
of them. They tried to prevent me from entering the Council of 
Ministers building. True, they did not touch me at this point; 
they only formed a human wall to prevent my entering. Of 
course, I went past them and approached People's Deputy Leonid 
Sinitsyn, head of my staff. They grabbed him by the arm, but he 
managed to break free. Professor [name indistinct], a member of 
our group and architect of our program, who became indignant 
over the entire incident, was also grabbed by the collar; they 
started to push him out of the House of Government, regardless 
of the fact that he had all the necessary official documents. 
The bodyguards lagged behind me, but, nevertheless, we went 
past the guards and up to the second floor and room 241, where 
my office is located. There were two militia guards standing 
there, while six others were running after me and shouting that 
Danko had forbidden me to be in the building -- there were four 
guards, plus the colonel and lieutenant colonel. I do not 
remember their names now, but they are identified in my 
complaint. Four of them seized me by the hands outside the 
office, one kicked me, and another tore my jacket. They 
scratched and hurt my hands. Well, naturally, I was forced to 
open the door with the help of [name indistinct] and Sinitsyn. 
We opened the door and entered the office. I do not know where 
they went after that. Still, all the necessary documentation to 
begin criminal proceedings against the men has been submitted to 
[Prosecutor General] Shaladonaw. In fact, I think that they 
have already instigated criminal proceedings and an examination 
by the Prosecutor's Office is under way. Doctors were already 
here and documented the injuries, as it should be, to avoid an 
incident similar to what happened at Lyozna [where shots were 
allegedly fired at a car carrying Lukashenka]. 
  [Rudkowski] What would you like to say to your supporters? 
  [Lukashenka] I would like them to participate in the second 
round of elections. This is the only thing I ask of them -- 
they should not waver. Later on, we will examine all the facts 
and nuances. These people will have to explain their deeds. I 
think there is no place for them to emigrate. Or, maybe, there 
is some place. At any rate, this is a general [Danko] who wants 
to get Lukashenka out of the way. That will not happen. The 
people have seen a real chance these days, and they will not 
lose this opportunity. I am very sure of that. I am supported 
[by the people] today. I believe that there will be 300,000 
people who will support me, and we will bring order to the 
Republic of Belarus. Namely, constitutional order, legal order, 
(?where) law will reign.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of statement by presidential candidate </F>
Alyaksandr Lukashenka during a news conference on 27 June; place 
not given -- recorded, in Russian] 
  [Text] [Words indistinct] you are participating in a small 
historical event. You should congratulate me for a small 
victory -- the Commission for Fighting Corruption is now able to 
come out from the underground and work openly. We came out 
today. I should say that the commission was joined today by a 
very large group of people's deputies who will officially 
cooperate with this commission. 
  We have big apprehensions as to whether the second round of 
presidential elections will be held at all. We expected 
Vyachaslaw Kebich to withdraw his candidacy; by the way, some 
journalists were already reporting this at 1500. We are 
actually afraid of this happening. That would be the first step 
toward a disruption of the second round, because later it will 
be easy to control people going to the polling stations. They 
will simply be forbidden, by leaders and other officials, to go 
to the polling stations. If you go to your polling station 
despite all the obstacles, it will mean that you are going to 
vote for Lukashenka. That is, it will be a very personal-style 
nationwide vote in the second round. However, this has not 
happened. 
  We also receive information from all those circles, which 
have started to scatter; they run [words indistinct] to our 
team, as well. They report that [words indistinct] Kebich will 
withdraw his candidacy. We thought that this would happen 
today, yet it did not. This is one of the main topics discussed 
by Kebich's team. I think that these people scarcely have any 
chance of winning in the second round. A disruption of the 
second round would lead to the Hryb scenario. According to the 
Constitution, if the presidential elections are declared 
invalid, [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Hryb will come to power. 
Well, it is surely better and more convenient [word indistinct] 
than that Lukashenka. 
  I had a very lengthy conversation with the head of the 
Central Electoral Commission about the next round of elections. 
This round may be held on 7 [July], but the Central Electoral 
Commission fears that the technical side of the preparations 
will be disrupted and that appropriate measures will be taken to 
disrupt the elections [words indistinct]. For example, a lack 
of ballots at the polling stations in due time may disrupt the 
second round. This means that the election may be declared 
invalid. Abramovich [head of the Central Electoral Commission] 
will be the person to blame, but, still, the elections could be 
declared invalid.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Starikevich: "Belorussia [Belarus]: </F>
Young Wolves Have Bared Their Teeth"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The results of the first round of the 
presidential election have put the spotlight on a new trend. 
Prestige is gradually gained by people in the Belorussian 
[Belarusian] political arena who are unconnected with existing 
parties and clans but who are skilled at winning votes from the 
electorate with attractive ideas. 
  On this occasion the idea in question is the struggle 
against 
corruption. A short while ago the government press attempted to 
depict People's Deputy Aleksandr Lukashenka as some Hercules 
cleaning out the Augean stables of corruption. But when the 
Council of Ministers' ideologists went into reverse, it was 
already too late: The former parliamentary commission chairman 
remained more or less the only honest person in the minds of the 
general public. What is more he is one of them, a man of the 
people. 
  But on his own Lukashenka would hardly have been able to 
maintain this essential position. Help came to him from 
politicians of the new wave whom former Speaker Stanislaw 
Shushkevich once called the "young wolves." The Lukashenka 
team's "think tank" comprises Dmitriy Bulakhow, chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet Commission for Legislation; Valeriy Tsepkala, a 
former adviser to Stanislaw Shushkevich; Viktor Hanchar, deputy 
chairman of Maladechna City Soviet Executive Committee; and 
several other people whose names are as yet little known to the 
public. The unifying force between them is a strong desire to 
get their way into power. Their backing for Lukashenka is for 
the moment proving to be justified. The "young wolves" have 
organized and are running his election campaign in a 
professional manner, which cannot be said about the majority of 
other teams. Without making any particular effort to win the 
votes of relatively small groups in the population, such as the 
intelligentsia, they have basically oriented themselves toward 
the rural areas and the urban working class. This brought them 
success in the first round. 
  The results of the 23 June poll came as a real shock for the 
government team. On Thursday [23 June] evening, journalists who 
were trying to get in contact with the Council of Ministers, 
discovered that nearly all its staffers who were at work were 
heavily under the influence of alcohol. It was in this way that 
stress was relieved throughout the weekend, which hardly 
promoted a sober assessment of the situation or helped to map 
out a future course of action. In the meantime, it seems that 
Vyacheslaw Kebich's entourage did everything it could to sink 
its own candidate in the first round. [There were] constant 
attempts to bribe voters (in one rayon veterans were handed 
envelopes with "from Vyacheslaw Kebich" on the outside and money 
inside, after which it was suggested that they vote 
immediately). The promotion of the prime minister's candidacy 
and the vilification of Lukashenka, Poznyak, and Shushkevich 
have rebounded. These tricks are no longer tolerated by the 
Belorussian public. But Kebich's team proved unable to put 
forward anything else at the time. 
  The democrats' failure is for the most part conditioned by a 
lack of unity in its ranks. The tiny parties -- the Belorussian 
Social Democratic Assembly [gromada] and the United Democratic 
Party of Belorussia [Belarus] -- decided to show everyone that 
they are just as good as anybody else, but were unable to come 
up with anything better than to nominate Stanislaw Shushkevich 
as a candidate. The former speaker flopped. 
  Once the preliminary results of the poll's first round were 
already known, the "Assembly" managed to complain in print about 
the Belorussian People's Front which did not support Shushkevich 
but nominated its leader Zenon Poznyak as a candidate, who, 
incidentally, polled more votes. 
  Kebich's team will attempt to change the course of the 
contest. The 24 hours [of breathing space] promised by 
Lukashenka to officials he considers guilty of corruption in 
which to "escape to the Himalayas" is not much of a consolation. 
Members of the Council of Ministers evidently have no idea of 
how in fact they will act. The few who were fit to work on 
Friday were hoping that all those who did not vote for the 
anticorruption campaigner in the first round would now vote 
against Lukashenka and therefore for them. But this scenario 
does not seem realistic. Even if events develop very favorably 
for Kebich, he will not succeed in closing such an immense gap. 
The only chance for his team is to wreck the election's second 
round and this will not be simple. 
  For his part, Lukashenka and his associates will attempt to 
build on the success they have already achieved. A strike 
against his rivals is not ruled out by way of an extra measure. 
According to information in the possession of IZVESTIYA, 
Valeriy Tsepkala is at present in Nigeria. His trip there was 
preceded by an incident involving the detention of a transport 
plane allegedly bound for this African country (though in fact 
actually bound for the former Yugoslavia) carrying Belorussian 
arms. If Tsepkala returns with serious enough compromising 
materials on the Council of Ministers, there can be no doubt 
that this information will soon be in the public domain.

  [Text] BELINFORM has been told by [name indistinct], head 
of the press service of the Belaya Rus-Slav Assembly Party, that 
early in July the Russian State Duma plans to discuss the 
possibility of creating a confederation between Belarus and 
Russia. Representatives of this party were invited to attend the 
discussion. 
  The Belaya Rus-Slav Assembly press service also reported 
that 
the Party Duma addresses the Belarusian Supreme Soviet with a 
proposal to hold -- during the second round of presidential 
elections -- a referendum with regard to rendering official 
status to the Russian language in Belarus, the creation of a 
confederation with Russia, and the introduction of dual, 
Belarusian-Russian, citizenship.

  [Text] Minsk is not ready for a monetary union with Russia 
because of uncertainties in government policies following the 
country's presidential elections, a senior official of the 
National Bank of Belarus (NBB) told INTERFAX on condition of 
anonymity. 
  He said none of the government agencies including the 
government, Finance Ministry, or NBB were making preparations 
for the union. Even the draft of an appropriate banking 
agreement is still pending discussion by experts, he said. 
  The official went on to say that for the time being, talks 
were under way between officials of the NBB and Central Bank of 
Russia to discuss the creation of a payment union on the basis 
of the two countries' currencies. (The appropriate draft was 
sent to Belarus last month). 
  The official said NBB President Stanislau Bagdankevich was 
still opposed to the endorsement of the agreement's Chapter 5, 
which provides for the abolition of the NBB. Nor does 
Bagdankevich accept the idea of a single budget or financing the 
country's deficit at the cost of credits from Russia's Finance 
Ministry. 
  Head of the Belarussian finance ministry's budget department 
Ivan Zayash in an interview with INTERFAX ruled out any monetary 
union as it was originally conceived by the April agreement by 1 
July on the grounds that some of its provisions had not been met 
yet. The two countries are still to decide how to unify their 
cash and non-cash resources and at what rate as well as how 
their budgets would function following the unification. More 
importantly, Moscow has so far granted only 10 billion rubles 
out of its promised 500 billion rubles credit to Belarus. It 
has now reaffirmed sending a further 50 billion rubles.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Levchuk: "Sovereignty, Anyway!"] </F>
  [Text] According to a poll conducted by the "West-East" 
Strategic Initiatives Center, 76.4 percent of the Belarusian 
people support the unification of the Belarusian and Russian 
monetary systems. 
  If the unification results in a ceding of powers to the 
Russian Government or Central Bank, the move will be supported 
by 39.6 percent of society. If the unification results in a 
loss of Belarusian sovereignty, only 24.5 will support this 
initiative.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Tushinskiy, Belarusian first </F>
deputy minister of defense, by Colonel Valeriy Kovalev, under 
the rubrics "Topical Theme" and "Newspaper Within a Newspaper -- 
On the Problems of the Military-Industrial Complex (Issue No. 
3)"; place and date not given: "It Is Easy to Destroy 
Production. It Is 100 Times More Difficult to Reestablish It" 
-- from the RUSSKOYE ORUZHIYE section] 
  [Text] From the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA file: 
  A.I. Tushinskiy was born in Minsk in 1945. He graduated from 
the Minsk Radiotechnical Institute. He has worked as an 
engineer and chief engineer at the Minsk computer unit plant, 
and then as general director of the Belorussian [Belarusian] 
"Computer Technology" Production Association. 
  In June 1992 he was appointed Belorusian first deputy 
minister of defense. He supervises questions of materiel and 
technical backup for the troops, technical policy, and 
conversion, and coordinates interaction between the military 
department and the Republic's defense industry. He is chairman 
of the Belorusian Republic Defense Ministry Scientific-Technical 
Council. 
  [Kovalev] Aleksandr Iosifovich, how would you assess the 
Republic's defense industry's potential? 
  [Tushinskiy] It is hard to give a simple answer to this 
question today. On the one hand Belorusia has a very large 
defense industry, which it inherited from the former Union. In 
the times of the unified union state, 112 industrial 
enterprises, scientific-research institutes, experimental design 
bureaus, and construction-assembly and other organizations 
worked for military needs, and over 200,000 scientists, 
designers, engineers, technicians, and workers were employed in 
them. Many articles that were developed and manufactured here 
have no counterparts -- we were the monopolists on certain 
models of combat equipment and components. But when, following 
Belorusia's acquisition of sovereign state status, an inventory 
of the defense industry was carried out, it turned out that it 
was in a position to provide for only 3 percent of the national 
army's needs in terms of weapons systems. This means around 20 
models of combat equipment and weapons. 
  In other words, the lion's share of output manufactured at 
our enterprises consisted of components -- equipment, 
subassemblies, hardware, instruments, and so-called basic 
supplies. That is, to put it figuratively, we turned out to be 
impoverished despite our wealth: Although we have a mighty 
military-industrial complex at our disposal, we can only use its 
potential to a limited extent to provide for our Armed Forces' 
needs. What is needed to increase that potential is a major 
structural overhaul of the defense industry. 
  [Kovalev] And is that work being conducted? 
  [Tushinskiy] Yes. On the government's instructions the 
Defense Ministry has elaborated a draft state weapons program 
for the period through the year 2000. It was recently examined 
and ratified at a sitting of the Defense Ministry Collegium. 
Now it is up to the government. In brief, this program boils 
down to bringing the level of supply of home-produced weapons 
and equipment to the Army from the present 3 percent up to 20 
percent by 2000, and considerably expanding our own potential 
for repairing weapons and combat equipment and manufacturing 
tool and accessories kits and spare parts. At present, our 
industry and Defense Ministry enterprises can only guarantee the 
repair of 2 percent of the 4,000-plus models of armaments and 
military hardware making up the arsenals. 
  [Kovalev] In light of what you have said, I cannot help 
wondering: From where will the remaining 80 percent of the 
armaments systems required to maintain the Belorusian Army's 
high level of combat readiness come? 
  [Tushinskiy] The missing hardware and armaments will, of 
course, have to be purchased. And these purchases have been 
built into the program. They have been specified according to 
quantity, product list, and deadlines. I will tell you right 
away that we are geared mainly toward Russia. 
  [Kovalev] But modern-day weaponry is not cheap. The 
Republic is known to be in a difficult financial position right 
now, and it is unlikely to be able to alter this in the next few 
years.... 
  [Tushinskiy] You are right, of course. Nevertheless, we 
hope to be able to obtain a minimum of requirements for troop 
back-up anyway. And, paradoxical though it may be, our defense 
sector will help with this once again. The fact is that a large 
part of its production used to go, indeed, still does go to 
Russia -- it is our main client. And it seems that in the 
future too the Russians will be interested in supplies from us, 
as Belorusia has a monopoly in the sphere of developing and 
producing a whole range of items of military significance. The 
relevant scientific research institutes and design bureaus have 
been set up, and the production technology has been installed. 
In our country, for instance, many highly important elements of 
space technology are produced, plus equipment for space 
stations. Minsk's wheeled vehicle plant produces truly unique 
multiaxled chassis for mobile strategic missile complexes, 
notably for the famous "Topol" -- the RS-12M. Right now the 
development of a new eight-axle chassis, unparalleled in terms 
of navigability, maneuverability, and technical sophistication, 
is approaching its culmination here. Belorusia does not need 
such a machine, but the fact is that the commander in chief of 
Russia's Strategic Missile Forces is asking for the tests and 
technical refinement to be completed here in full.... The 
tractor plant is producing tracked vehicles for systems no less 
famous than the "Tor" and the "Tunguska." As yet there is 
nothing, as far as I know, to match our automated guidance and 
control systems, certain types of optical appliance, photometric 
technology, or reconnaissance devices. The list goes on. 
  Belorusia will supply items produced here to Russian orders 
and update them, and in exchange we will acquire everything that 
our Armed Forces need. 
  I am hardly rediscovering America here, by the way: There 
are agreements in this respect on questions of 
military-technical cooperation between the governments of our 
countries. As yet, unfortunately, they are functioning in by no 
means ideal fashion. 
  The situation is intensified many times over by the enormous 
difference in prices for energy sources and raw materials -- in 
Belorusia these are somewhat higher than in Russia. Production 
from our defense enterprises, as a result, is becoming too 
expensive for Russian producers. But even if an order is 
received and fulfilled, this still does not guarantee prompt 
payment. How are workers and engineers meant to survive in such 
a situation? What can be used to acquire raw materials? Or 
components from subcontractors? How can the production base be 
updated or even maintained at the requisite level? Unless the 
situation changes, I fear that the Republic's defense industry, 
even without a conversion process, will not be long for this 
world.... 
  [Kovalev] The picture you paint is not very optimistic. 
Where then is the way out of the existing situation? 
  [Tushinskiy] The treaty signed in Moscow on 12 April this 
year on a monetary alliance between our countries does inspire 
some optimism. If it is introduced in full, the situation will 
be rectified a little. On its own, however, this agreement is 
of little use, and our governments and military departments need 
urgently to sit down at the negotiating table and define their 
positions on an entire range of questions linked with future 
cooperation in the defense industry sphere. As a result, our 
scientists, designers, and producers should get a clear, 
long-term program, a state order, and the necessary financial 
resources for its implementation. 
  Right now, as we know, Russia is striving to win back 
positions lost in the world weapons market. This is undoubtedly 
a worthy decision. But many components for the most modern 
hardware and weaponry are produced in Belorusia. So there is a 
direct link here: If our defense industry suffocates, so to 
speak, and it is forced to wind down military production 
completely, then Russia will inevitably lose speed in breaking 
into the world market in respect of some of the most vital 
positions. Moreover, this concerns the production of arms and 
military hardware for their own Armed Forces, too. But if we 
can achieve close coordination in the work of our 
military-industrial complexes, it will prove possible to avoid 
losses in both speed and quality. The two sides can only gain 
from this. 
  [Kovalev] But will it not be the case that, while the 
upper echelons are negotiating about collaboration, the 
Belorusian defense sector will be reduced to precious little 
more than a few nuts and bolts? 
  [Tushinskiy] There are, of course, grounds for such fears. 
But not everything is as gloomy as it may have appeared to you 
from my account. We are by no means sitting back with folded 
arms. Contacts between Belorusian and Russian defense sector 
workers and between the military departments, despite all the 
difficulties, have not broken down. Yes, the volumes of orders 
have approached a critical level, but they are still coming in. 
And yes, the problem of payment defaulting is very severe; but, 
as soon as our Russian partners do receive money, the first 
accounts they seek to pay are those of the Belorusian suppliers. 
In its turn, our defense workers do not insist on payment up 
front, and they are striving to complete Russian orders in good 
faith, to a high standard, and on time. At times our scientific 
research institutes and design bureaus continue with promising 
developments and the technical finishing of new items on the 
strength of pure enthusiasm alone, so to speak. For instance, 
at our proving ground equipment plant, state-of-the-art 
simulators for training T-72 tank operators have just been 
tested and brought into series production. They will be 
supplied to Russia. We have succeeded in agreeing with our 
Russian colleagues on the uncompensated exchange of technical 
documentation, which is very important for us, insofar as we 
intend to expand the list of types of military hardware 
repairable at republic enterprises. We are holding talks with 
the Russians on setting up joint ventures. 
  In Orsha, for instance, on the basis of the aviation repair 
plant a joint venture for the repair of MiG-29 fighter aircraft 
will begin to operate very soon. The Russian side will offer us 
the requisite documentation and spares. A program for the joint 
production in Belorusia of a dual-purpose aircraft -- suitable 
for scientific and training purposes and to serve business 
people -- is at the compilation stage. The aviation design 
bureau headed by Aleksandr Nikolayevich Tereshchenko and a 
number of Russian federation enterprises are acting as founders 
of the project. And there is another joint project that we will 
be starting in the near future -- recycling old munitions that 
are past their storage life. We have specific projections here. 
Russia has shown an interest in them. So we will pool efforts 
here to our mutual advantage. We are moving toward the 
flotation of defense enterprises: In particular, the Gomel 
"cluster" of our military-industrial complex and Russia's 
"Vympel" Science-and-Production Association are setting up a 
joint stock company right now, and they will work together on 
conversion programs and on the production of defense output. 
  In short, despite everything, the links between the defense 
sectors of Belorussia and Russia have not been broken once and 
for all. And, I hope, they never will be. I am convinced that 
our fraternal countries will together show concern for 
reinforcing the Armed Forces. As we know only too well, 
something can be destroyed in the space of an hour, but 
reestablishing what has been ruined takes many years and 
concerted efforts.

  [Text] Comrat, BASAPRESS, 25/06/1994 -- "It seems that the 
Council of Europe [CE] representatives either do not completely 
understand the situation in the southern districts or follows 
someone's command, as during the negotiations in Comrat they 
emphasized that Gagauzians are not a nation and that human 
rights are superior to nationalities' rights," states a 
communique of the Gagauz Supreme Soviet and President. The 
communique states that the CE experts said that Gagauzians 
cannot assume priority over other national minorities that live 
in Moldova: they believe that Gagauzians can receive only 
cultural autonomy. The CE experts agreed with the Gagauz 
Parliamentary Commission on the 12 articles of the draft law on 
the "Gaguz Eri" project. The law's preamble and Articles 1, 2, 
and 12 on the Gagauzians' self-determination and Gagauz Eri 
self-administration as well as the prerogatives of the local 
administration were discussed. The CE recommendations are 
juridical amendments that were accepted by the Gagauz side. The 
communique states that the "meeting in Comrat was productive. 
However, as a result of the negotiations held with the CE 
representatives the conclusion can be drawn that an unjustified 
delay in settling the Gagauz problem is again imposed due to 
Moldovan officials that create artificial barriers and deceive 
not only the Moldovan public but the international organizations 
as well." It is obviously Moldova's wish to enter the CE without 
resolving political problems, but the Gagauz issue impedes the 
fulfillment of this wish: that is why spirits are again stirred 
around a problem that should have been settled long ago, states 
the communique.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 25/06/1994 -- "Many political 
games surround the Gagauz problem," stated Nikolai Telpiz, 
Gagauz deputy speaker, to BASA, commenting on the results of the 
meeting between Gagauz legislators and the Socialist Unity 
faction on the "Gagauz Eri" project. According to him, Comrat 
representatives were surprised "to hear the proposal to discuss 
a draft on special juridical status modified by the Moldovan 
Parliamentary Commission and not the one previously drafted by 
the Moldovan and Gagauz Parliamentary commissions." Valeriu 
Senic, Socialist Unity faction leader, chatted on the Socialist 
Unity faction representatives to support the modifications 
proposed by the Moldovan Parliamentary commission. "The Gagauz 
Parliamentary Commission sent a protest to the Moldovan 
Parliamentary Commission which unilaterally modified the draft 
law; the draft does not favor the Gagauz side and limits the 
potency of the `Gagauz Eri -- Gagauzia'."

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 25/06/1994 -- The fourth 
Congress of Intelligentsia was held today in Chisinau. Some 400 
delegates representing most Moldovan localities and numerous 
guests including Ion Solcanu, deputy chairman of the Romanian 
Senate and U.S. and Romanian Embassy representatives. Alexandra 
Mosanu, Congress of Intelligentsia (CI) chairman, stated in the 
report that "the socio-political movement, Congress of 
Intelligentsia, was born under conditions of political crisis 
which were caused in late 1992-early 1993 by the Moldovan 
president and forces supporting him." According to Mosanu, a 
short time after its set-up the CI succeeded in affirming itself 
in the political arena. The parliamentary elections showed that 
this formation "has established itself within the society." 
Specifying that the Peasants and Intellectuals Block won over 
163,000 votes, thus 11 seats in the Parliament, Mosanu gauged 
that "in general, the election results were modest for this 
block." He also mentioned that "the pro-imperialist reactionary 
forces fight against the freedom conquered by the national 
emancipation movement and Moldovan independence as well. Subtly 
manipulated by officials, many citizens fell in the trap of 
Romanophobia, while others are overwhelmed by apathy and 
indifference or by nostalgia for the former communist regime." 
According to Mosanu, a major reason for the "the 
agrarian-interfrontists' victory" in elections was "the 
preservation of the old structures of the totalitarian regime in 
economic and state administration as well as the seizure of 
important positions in the national private economy by 
anti-national forces." At the Cl leadership's proposal the 
delegates changed the name of the formation to the Moldovan 
United Democratic Congress [CDUM]. Several changes were 
introduced into the statute and thus the adherence of certain 
parties to the congress was facilitated. Leaders of the 
Democratic Party and Christian Democratic Party declared their 
adherence to the Congress. They argued that the congress 
facilitated the conditions for adherence and that the objectives 
and social foundation of the parties are almost identical. They 
also said that it is necessary "to unite all national democratic 
movements." The wish to "merge with the Congress on the basis 
of its statute and program" was reiterated by most speakers. 
Nicolae Dabija, CI deputy chairman, stated that fruitful 
negotiations concerning a future merger with representatives of 
several parties were held. Deputy Valeriu Matei was elected 
chairman of the United Democratic Congress. According to the 
CDUM, the post of chairman can be retained two consecutive 
periods. The CDUM session -- the new name of the supreme 
meeting of the formation -- elected other leading organs.

  [Text] A KAZTAG correspondent learned from the 
Constitutional Court that it postponed examination of the 
constitutional validity of Article 60 of the Election Code until 
1 July. This article concerns election collateral and the 
obligatory collection of 3,000 signatures supporting a 
constituency candidate for deputy in Supreme Kenges. Candidates 
from the state list do not have to collect any signatures. 
  In the opinion of Deputy Burnashov, who instituted the legal 
issue, these provisions contradict the constitutional norms on 
the equality of rights of citizens and create allowances for 
some categories of voters and candidates. As is known, 
examination of the case on 6 June was postponed in connection 
with the untimely appointment by parliament of their 
representative. This mistake has now been corrected. The 
necessary procedural measures have been taken in order to ensure 
the rights of one of the sides, namely the Supreme Kenges.

  [Text] Almaty -- It seems that one of the Supreme Soviet's 
plenary meetings soon will get down to ratifying the agreement 
with the Russian Federation on the lease of the Baykonur 
cosmodrome. A group of its deputies is speaking in favor of 
this. According to information received from confidential 
sources, a considerable number of deputies have been persuaded 
to this effect. 
  It seems that the government of Kazakhstan is willing to 
meet 
them halfway on this issue. At least, Prime Minister 
Tereshchenko in his recent speech at the Supreme Soviet session 
could not justify dragging out ratification of this important 
agreement by a number of officials. He has promised to submit 
it for consideration by the deputies not later than the 
beginning of this week [as received]. 
  However, the agreement, which was signed by the two 
countries 
during the official visit to Russia by President Nazarbayev at 
the end of March, has not yet been implemented. The term of 
three months, which has been allocated by governments of both 
countries for its finalizing, expires tomorrow. A lot of work 
is needed in drafting its final text and signing the agreement 
on the lease of the space site. 
  It is also important that after the accord on Baykonur was 
reached at high level between Kazakhstan and Russia, attempts 
were made to revise some of its main provisions. For example, 
several letters have been received by the relevant government 
commission from the Leninsk city administration and the city 
soviet. The letters said that the principles of the agreement 
contradict the wishes of local citizens. Therefore, Leninsk 
should be singled out as a separate administrative and 
territorial unit subordinate to Kazakhstan. 
  Those deputies who favor speedy ratification believe that 
such a stance does not accord with the Republic's basic 
interests. The space site and the town Leninsk make up a single 
body and they should be transferred to the jurisdiction of the 
Russian Federation as such. This has been secured by the Moscow 
agreement. 
  We should mention here an article by Tarbya Sarabekova, 
secretary of the Supreme Soviet's Committee for Economic Reform, 
who used to work as the chairman of the Committee for State 
Property of Leninsk. Published in the latest issue of PANORAMA 
weekly, it says: "Kazakhstan owns Baykonur but it does not have 
an intellectual property for it, scientific and technical staff, 
or plants for the production of space equipment. All of them 
belong mainly to Russia. Therefore, we are facing now the 
problem of not losing it forever and turning it into an open 
space museum, which would not last long. It will take three 
months for it to be covered with sand. The space site is 
located in a desert area, with moving barkhans. If Russia 
leaves it, then there will not be any reason to work there and 
they will not be anyone to do the job. The space site will 
eventually die." 
  Sarabekova believes that "leasing the Baykonur space site 
and its infrastructure accords with the basic interests of 
Kazakhstan." The Republic has no money for its maintainance. It 
does not have its own space industry, qualified personnel, or 
design centers. The agreement will provide us with the chance 
to gradually accumulate these things. If this chance is not 
used then Kazakhstan would not be able to make a 
scientific-technological breakthrough in the near future.

<F P=106> [Video report from Kazakhstan by correspondent Alla </F>
Nugmanova, including recordings of comments by Y. Usov, 
president of AKPO joint-stock company, and President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev -- from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] The world's first fast breeder reactor at Aktau, the 
center of Mangistau oblast, has been shut down, just like many 
other industrial installations in the Republic. The reason for 
this is that there is no fuel -- or, to be more precise, there 
is no money with which to buy it. This despite the fact that 
the Republic has its own fuel resources. Debts and nonpayments 
within the Republic are increasing. Suppliers themselves have 
no funds. The economic crisis is hitting specialists worst. 
You cannot survive without a proper salary here. 
  [Usov] A quarter of our staff have left the works during the 
last four months. It is not just that we cannot pay wages, the 
two main problems are: 1) We cannot pay railway charges; and 2) 
We cannot pay customs duty. But we cannot keep our telephones 
going, either. We cannot get any work done. 
  [Nugmanova] In this situation President Nazarbayev offers a 
stark solution. He says all subsidies to enterprises from the 
budget should end. Loss-making plants must be declared 
bankrupt. It is cheaper for the state to pay unemployment 
benefit to workers made redundant when these plants close than 
to subsidize them. 
  [Nazarbayev] [words indistinct] so, the state will not issue 
any worthless money.

<F P=106> [Report by Albert Musin: "Special Services Are Active Not </F>
Only on Their Own Turf. A Spate of Resignation Begins Among 
Republic's Leaders"] 
  [Text] It became known the other day that in the capital 
of Kazakhstan, Alma-Ata [Almaty], Uzbekistan's special services 
kidnapped well-known opposition leader Murad Dzhurayev, whom 
they had been hunting for his part in publishing the ERKH 
newspaper. 
  Dzhurayev was grabbed in a private apartment. According to 
some information, Erkin Ashurov, director of the Samarkand tea 
packaging factory, was arrested with him. To all appearances 
the kidnapped men were taken out to Tashkent. 
  When Kazakhstan human rights activists asked the Republic's 
prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Internal Affairs for 
clarification regarding this, yet another incident involving 
Uzbekistan's special services, the reply was once again that the 
local law enforcement organs "had not been notified" about the 
holding of the "operational measure" by Ministry of Internal 
Affairs operatives of another state on territory within their 
jurisdiction. 
  It can also be stated that the agreements on cooperation 
between special services and law enforcement organs of CIS 
states (the latest such agreement was signed between Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan in Dzhambul on 12 May) contain no 
mechanism to prevent abuses and violations of human rights on 
the part of these services. 
  Meanwhile, in Uzbekistan they are vividly discussing a whole 
series of sensational resignations and "transfers to other jobs" 
of ranking leading lights including Mavlon Umurzakov, chief 
adviser to the president; and Islambek Yusufbekov, chairman of 
the State Committee on Science, among others. 
  More remarkable in this series is the firing of Umurzakov, 
who was in charge of "cadre selection and placement" both when 
he was head of the organizational department of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan and in the 
position of adviser to the president, and who has been regarded 
as one of the most powerful men at the top. His resignation 
touched off a whole chain of dismissals of officials of various 
ranks down to regional officials who used to be his "proteges." 
Umurzakov was sent, according to Karimov's order, to be "in 
charge of Syrdarya Oblast," only to disappear without a trace. 
Rumors have it that he is on the run because he had come to 
take bribes without moderation, thereby causing displeasure 
among his comrades and primarily another "gray eminence," Ismail 
Dzhurabekov, who had earlier been unrivaled in this department 
and had invariably been agricultural vice prime minister ever 
since Rashidov's times. According to one view, Karimov is 
getting rid of his closest but too despicable comrades in arms 
in this manner in a bid to bolster his positions, which have 
been seriously shaken of late. 
  Local observers note an extremely nervous atmosphere among 
the president's entourage and among his staff as a whole. In 
their opinion, the staff is weary, harassed by constant 
contradictory and excessive demands, and whereas any official 
could dream of getting close to "the man at the top" in the 
past, now only few feel attracted by the prospect.

  [Text] Yerevan, June 28 (SNARK) -- Armenia is the only 
country in CIS where the growth of basic economic indicators is 
observed. According to the State Statistical Administration data 
published in Yerevan today, the produced national income during 
the five months of this year has increased as compared to the 
corresponding period last year by 7.5 percent and the volume of 
industrial output grew by 12 percent. 
  At the same time, say specialists, such a growth indicates 
only insignificant improvement in the state of economy where a 
steep slump was observed in 1992-93. 
  Due to the permanent blockade of communications and 
insolvency, Armenia, still experiences a shortage of raw 
materials and electricity and the life level of the republic 
continues to remain the lowest among the CIS countries.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] President Geydar Aliyev was 
pleased with the Turkish prime minister's parliamentary motion 
requesting authority to participate in the multinational force 
in Azerbaijan and to set up installations in Turkey to extend 
support to this force. Replying to our questions, Aliyev said 
that a multinational force including Turkey would prevent 
efforts to impose solutions on the problem. Turkey is the 
greatest guarantee for Azerbaijan, he said, adding that the 
latest move by the Turkish Government proves this once again. 
  Aliyev expressed the belief that Turkey's participation in 
the multinational force will help solve the Nagorno-Karabakh 
problem quickly and justly.

  [Text] Russian Deputy Defense Minister, Colonel-General 
Georgiy Kondratyev said he was sure that the first Georgian 
refugees would be capable of returning to the Abkhaz region of 
Ghali in the near future. He admitted in an interview with 
Interfax today that the refugee question was one of the main 
issues in finding a settlement to the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. 
  Kondratyev said that during the next six months (the term 
during which Russian peacekeepers will be staying in the region) 
the Georgian and Abkhaz leaders would have a chance to make a 
significant move forward in wide-scale settlement of the 
conflict. "Servicemen have done what they were expected to do. 
Now politicians must say their word," he said. 
  Kondratyev returned from the conflict zone on June 27. He 
announced that the Russian peace-keeping troops had completed 
all their tasks -- established control and set up monitoring 
posts. 
  Kondratyev said that inhabitants of both Georgia and 
Abkhazia 
had welcomed Russian peacekeepers. He added that the parties 
were respecting the cease-fire agreement signed in Moscow on May 
14. 
  Kondratyev stressed that the peace-keeping operation in the 
zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict was carried out under the 
CIS sign, not only under that of Russia. Kondratyev said he 
believed that monitors and peacekeepers from other CIS countries 
would soon appear in the region.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Koretskiy report: "Returning to the Motherland </F>
Is Not as Easy as Crossing the Inguri River"] 
  [Text] Georgian head Eduard Shevardnadze yesterday 
expressed the hope for an early and massive return of refugees 
to Abkhazia -- but this is hardly destined to materialize. 
Abkhazia's position remains unchanged: Each returning refugee 
will be screened and vetted as to whether he has not been 
implicated in military or other criminal activity on the 
autonomy's territory during hostilities. Thus, returning to 
Abkhazia will be no easier than crossing the border. Therefore 
any talk about the massive scale or speediness of this process 
is senseless. 
  Eduard Shevardnadze believes that the return of "large 
masses 
of refugees" to Abkhazia is possible within the next few days. 
The process will begin as soon as the bridge across the Inguri 
river has been restored, groups of refugees formed, and a 
schedule for their movement drawn up. Shevardnadze entrusted 
this mission to Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsiya and 
Defense Minister Varden Nadibaidze, who were to leave Tbilisi 
yesterday for a place in immediate proximity to the 
disengagement line in the city of Zugdidi. 
  Indeed, the bridge across the Inguri can be restored in the 
next few days (after a corresponding order has been issued, 
engineers will cope with this task within just a few hours). 
Schedules for the refugees to cross the demarcation line can be 
drawn up and coordinated with the Abkhazia side in two to three 
days. But making up individual lists of refugees is not a 
matter of just one week. Yesterday Igor Akhba, head of the 
Abkhazia mission in Moscow, told KOMMERSANT-DAILY's 
correspondent that the Abkhaz side considers screening of each 
refugee a matter of principle. Sukhumi does not intend to 
abandon this principle: It will not allow a spontaneous return. 
Neither is there a mechanism for the return: The quadripartite 
commission's consultations continue. 
  Considering that in early July another round of 
Georgian-Abkhaz talks on a political settlement -- which has 
been delayed on several occasions following the introduction of 
peacekeeping forces -- is to begin, it is not ruled out that the 
refugee problem will become an Achilles heel for the Georgian 
delegation. Sukhumi, by manipulating this issue, will be able 
to obtain further concessions from Tbilisi. The latter will be 
appealing to Moscow, insisting that toughness be shown toward 
the Abkhaz. In any event Eduard Shevardnadze will be caught in 
a cross fire. He will not be able to avoid a compromise with 
Vladislav Ardzinba, who wants to talk with Tbilisi as equals. At 
the same time the Georgian leader will have to put this 
political authority on the line by submitting the accords 
reached to parliament's judgment.

  [Text] Soviet-time "red passports" expire on July 1 as the 
government decided not to renew them, Prime Minister Mart Laar 
told a government briefing on Tuesday. 
  All Estonian citizens should by now hold Estonian passports 
and older people who have not obtained a new passport should 
have no difficulties in receiving their benefits as post 
stations would accept old passports as ID's, Laar said. 
  Laar also said that by September a booklet would be issued 
for foreigners in Estonia where they can find information on 
applying for a foreigners' passport, Estonian citizenship, etc.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 28, BNS -- The newly appointed 
finance minister, Andres Lipstok, submitted an application to 
the Liberal Democratic Party leadership Monday seeking 
suspension of his membership in the party. 
  The Liberal Democratic Party accepted the applicaton and 
stated that Finance Minister Andres Lipstok no longer is a 
member of the party, Heiki Kranich of the Liberal faction in 
the parliament said. 
  Lipstok, whose appointment to the ministerial office was 
formally approved by the president Monday, agreed to accept the 
posting despite the Liberals having shortly before quit the 
ruling coalition. The posts of the minister of culture and 
education, and of finance, became vacant after Liberal 
ministers Paul-Eerik Rummo and Heiki Kranich left the 
government. Lipstok before his appointment was head of county 
government in Estonia's western Laanemaa region.

  [Text] Prime Minister Mart Laar said at a government 
briefing on Tuesday that his Isamaa (Fatherland) Party was there 
to remain despite evident break-up within. "Isamaa's separation 
into different directions is saddening and profits no one," Laar 
said while adding that the party was there to stay as the number 
of its supporters had at places increased. 
  Isamaa has been in a crisis for around eight months and the 
debate has fuelled after the Conservatives left on Monday. 
Estonian press on Tuesday predicted that the Republicans were 
to follow leaving Laar only with his Christian Democrats. 
Isamaa was formed on the basis of four parties: the Republican 
Coalition Party, the Conservative Peoples Party, the Christian 
Democratic Union and the Christian Democratic Party whose close 
cooperation before general elections in September 1992 brought 
them to power. 
  A solution to the crisis was expected to be reached at party 
congress on June 11 which brought victory to Laar who was re- 
elected as chairman beating Republican Ulo Nugis (parliamentary 
speaker) and Conservative Kaido Kama (former Justice Minister). 
  Laar said on Tuesday he intended to decide whether to remain 
premier in August or September.

  [Text] As is known, President Guntis Ulmanis of Latvia has 
announced that he will not promulgate the citizenship law which 
now, according to the Constitution, must be debated again at a 
plenary sitting of the Saeima. Today at his residence, Ulmanis 
held a news conference at which he explained the reasons for his 
decision. 
  I cannot sign a law that as a result of which Latvia will 
clearly be isolating itself, said Ulmanis. Besides, the 
president also objects to the fact that no law has yet been 
adopted regulating the status of stateless persons and 
foreigners. As already reported, international experts' 
recommendations do not correspond to Article 14 in the law on 
citizenship, which provides an annual naturalization quota of 
0.1 percent of the number of Latvian citizens in the previous 
year, starting from the year 2000. Many foreign envoys, too, 
have tried to convince Latvian politicians that the citizenship 
law does not correspond to the requirements adopted in Europe. 
Letters about it have been sent by the governments of the 
United States, Great Britain, Germany, and France. In Ulmanis' 
opinion, the citizenship law cannot be ideal, as it is resolving 
the consequences of the occupation of Latvia; however, the 
president still favors the law balancing the survival of the 
Latvian nation and civic harmony. He also predicted that the 
changes to the citizenship law will after all be two contentious 
points. Evidently the Saeima's plenary session on it will take 
place after the visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton to Latvia. 
Ulmanis noted the possibility that the visit could leave a 
positive impression for the solution of this issue. At the news 
conference Ulmanis also reproached the Latvian Government and 
parliament because these institutions had placed the 
responsibility on him of settling, in place of these 
institutions, important political issues that exceed the duties 
of the president provided in the Constitution of the Republic of 
Latvia. The Constitution does not provide political 
responsibility to the state president for his activity.

of Russian forces from Latvia. A decision was made at a 
government session which has just taken place, on permission for 
Russian military personnel and members of their families to stay 
until 31 August. We asked Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the 
government commission for monitoring the withdrawal of the 
Russian Army, to comment. 
  [Begin Upmalis recording] So far, permits of stay have been 
valid until 30 June. As the stipulated period is expiring and 
the deadline for the withdrawal set in interstate agreements is 
31 August, amendments were made today to the previous decision, 
and it was stipulated that permits to stay have been extended 
until 31 August 1994. The procedure is that, Army units have to 
submit lists of military personnel, as well as lists of members 
of families, who have these permits to stay. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Orlov under the "Commonwealth" rubric: </F>
"Bloc-Based Security System Necessary, Leonid Ivashov, Secretary 
of the CIS Defense Ministers' Council, Believes"] 
  [Text] The Collective Security Treaty signed by the CIS in 
Tashkent 15 May 1992, Leonid Ivashov stated, proved to be a not 
really effective barrier to the process of military 
disintegration and, in the broader sense, defense 
disintegration. Defense alliance is the most acceptable of all 
the possible forms of cooperation in the military sphere, in the 
view of the secretary of the CIS Defense Ministers' Council. 
The aims of that alliance would be not only to prevent and 
repel potential aggression against alliance states but also to 
resolve the problem of establishing mutual trust. The 
Collective Security Treaty does not prevent the creation of a 
defense alliance. 
  What are the priority tasks to be resolved when forming the 
defense alliance? First of all, Mr. Ivashov believes, it is 
necessary to create a system of legal guarantees for the 
agreements reached by the allies and a mechanism to monitor 
violations of them. It is then necessary to develop 
mobilizational plans and plans for the stockpiling of resources. 
The creation of armed groupings and their deployment on the 
borders of the CIS will also become an urgent need if an 
alliance is formed. 
  For the effective functioning of the collective security 
system it is proposed to extend the provisions of the Tashkent 
Treaty and divide the system into regional subsystems. Each 
subsystem must have a political and military leadership and 
military groupings. Their titles are hypothetical at the moment. 
  The East European Subsystem (Belarus, Kaliningrad Oblast, 
and 
the western oblasts of the Russian Federation). The center 
would be in Minsk, the commander in chief -- the president of 
the Republic of Belarus. 
  The Transcaucasus Subsystem (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
and the North Caucasus region of Russia). The center would be 
in Rostov-na-Donu, the commander in chief would be the leader 
[rukovoditel] of the Russian forces. 
  The Central Asian Subsystem (Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan). The tentative center would be Tashkent. 
  The Russia-Kazakhstan Subsystem (Kazakhstan, the Russian 
Federation Urals Military District). The center would be in 
Alma-Ata [Almaty], the commander in chief -- the president of 
the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
  The secretary of the Defense Ministers' Council explained 
that the subsystems are necessary for the following reasons: To 
deter the Afghan opposition (the Central Asian Subsystem), to 
create a military grouping to counteract China's Xinjiang Group 
of Forces (the Russia-Kazakhstan Subsystem), to establish 
lasting peace in the Caucasus (the Transcaucasus Subsystem), and 
to form forces analogous to the troop structures of the NATO 
countries in Europe, first and foremost the Bundeswehr (the East 
European Subsystem). 
  There is no unity yet within either the military leadership 
or the diplomatic leadership of Russia on the question of 
creating the bloc-based collective security system necessary in 
the Russian Federation. The Russian Foreign Ministry leadership 
objects particularly to this concept. Meanwhile, Leonid Ivashov 
stressed, the most powerful military grouping -- the NATO bloc 
-- still exists and Russia's affiliation to it is, at the 
moment, highly problematic. The adoption by the CIS member 
countries of political decisions aimed at creating an effective 
collective security system will serve as a guarantee of 
political stability in all the CIS countries.

  [Text] The additional powers granted to the law-enforcement 
bodies by the president shall only be used in relation to 
individuals suspected of banditry or membership in a group of 
criminals who have committed serious crimes, says the joint 
directive on the procedure of implementing the decree, signed by 
acting Prosecutor-General Aleksey Ilyushenko, Interior Minister 
Viktor Yerin and Director of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service Sergey Stepashin. 
  The document says that the term "gang" shall be applied to 
two or more armed individuals who have formed a group for 
carrying out one or more attacks on organizations, enterprises 
or individual citizens. 
  Pending the initiation of legal action, checks on suspects' 
financial and economic activity, and property and financial 
status, shall be made only if reliable evidence is available 
pointing to the individual's or organization's involvement in 
criminal activity. Preliminary checks shall be made following 
the issue of a permit by inquiry bodies, approved by the 
prosecutor. 
  Prosecutors, investigators and specialists involved in the 
implementation of the decree shall be warned about their 
responsibility for disclosing or mishandling state and 
commercial secrets. 
  Banks and commercial organizations shall present documents 
on 
their financial and economic activity, and information about the 
deposits and operations of juridical entities and individuals 
involved in serious organized crimes, following the receipt of a 
motivated inquiry from the prosecutor, investigator or head of 
an inquiry body, based on a suit or results of a check. 
  An individual suspected of committing a crime and detained 
for more than three days shall have full access to the rights 
envisaged in the constitution and the Criminal Code, including 
the right to have a lawyer. 
  If there is sufficient evidence, charges shall be brought 
against the detainee, after which he shall be put in custody for 
a term of up to 30 days. 
  The directive instructs the prosecutors to take proper 
measures to reveal and exclude instances of illegal detention of 
citizens without prior checks on their financial and economic 
activity, and property and financial status, particularly the 
suspects' and defendants' relatives, physical entities and 
public associations. They shall also exclude actions which can 
inflict damage on citizens' property or reputation, promptly 
respond to complaints, take urgent measures to restore violated 
rights and initiate legal action against criminals.

  [Text] The Russian International Center of Scientific and 
Technical Information believes that the restructuring and 
conversion of the Russian defense industry will require between 
$150 billion and $300 billion. 
  This estimate was made by a leading figure at the center 
Vladimir Zhukov at a current Moscow seminar on Western 
investments in the Russian defense industry. He said it is 
based on consultations with Western exerts. 
  Representatives of companies and analytical centers said 
that 
the existing plans of attracting investments from Russian 
commercial banks and for formation of a special export-import 
bank cannot guarantee the volume of investments needed to 
restructure the defense industry. 
  According to Zhukov, in conditions of galloping inflation, 
mutual debts, and low turnover as many as half of all defense 
plants are on the verge of ruin and the number of jobless in the 
industry might grow to several million by the end of the year. 
  The conversion program affects almost 80 percent of the 
industry: in the Soviet Union military spending amounted to 30 
percent of the GNP.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Kirillov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun (TASS) -- Qian Qichen called the 
agreement on the visit by China's chairman Jiang Zemin to the 
Russian Federation which will begin on 2 September as the main 
achievement of his meetings and talks in Moscow. He stated this 
at the press conference held at the Foreign Ministry press 
center at the Zubovskaya square. 
  He especially mentioned the initialling of the agreement on 
the western section of the Chinese-Russian border. According to 
the Chinese foreign minister, in the past few years bilateral 
relations and especially business links have developed 
considerably, "they far exceeded former Chinese-Soviet ties." 
  Answering an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question on China's 
policy towards the Central Asian countries, former USSR 
republics, Qian Qichen said that since these countries achieved 
their independence their contacts with China, previously of 
indirect nature, have now become direct. Especially good 
relations are being established in the sphere of trade. "We 
would like to continue to strengthen our relations with these 
countries, at the same time hoping that their ties within the 
CIS framework and with the Russian Federation will also continue 
to develop," said the Chinese minister. 
  Speaking of Russia's accession to the Partnership for Peace 
treaty, Qian Qichen noted that the Russian Federation, which is 
a major European state, maintains extensive links with its 
neighbors in Europe, especially after the ending of 
confrontation between the two military blocs. "We regard with 
understanding the fact that Russia maintains relations of 
partnership with the countries of Europe. We hope that such 
relations will promote the strengthening of peace and stability 
in the region and also throughout the world. We believe that 
these relations will not in any way harm the development of 
links between Russia and China." 
  Qian Qichen said that he had not discussed questions of 
selling Russian weapons to China today. This subject, he said, 
will not be raised during Jiang Zemin's forthcoming visit to 
Moscow, either. 
  Speaking about the situation around the Spratly (Nanwei) 
islands, which are claimed by several southeast Asian countries 
as well as by China, Qian Qichen expressed the opinion that at 
the present stage discussions should be halted an a start should 
be made to the joint exploitation of this region. 
  Speaking of nuclear problems, the minister stressed that 
China is a party to the treaty on the nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons and is strictly guided by its provisions. The 
PRC, he stressed, is in favor of advancing the talks on 
concluding a convention on the total banning of nuclear weapons 
and intends to promote the signing of this treaty before 1996. 
As far as nuclear tests are concerned, China is in favor of the 
total elimination and complete banning of nuclear weapons tests.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Anatoliy Krasnov and </F>
Vladimir Solntsev] 
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- PRC President Jiang Zemin, who 
will pay an official visit to Russia in September, will discuss 
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin the question of 
how,"looking towards the 21st century, from the point of view of 
a strategic perspective, to build the future" of bilateral 
relations. This was stated today by Qian Qichen, PRC vice 
premier and foreign minister, who is in Moscow on an official 
visit, speaking at Moscow State University. 
  The head of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that the 
results of Boris Yeltsin's visit to China in December 1992 
"initiated a new era in Sino-Russian relations." The minister 
noted that he was "very pleased" with today's meeting with the 
Russian president. 
  "China's consistent policy regarding development of 
relations 
with Russia," he said, "is based on the fact that it fully 
respects the choice of the Russian people and always aims at 
developing long-term and stable relations of neighborliness, 
friendship, and mutual cooperation on the basis of the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence, regardless of how the 
domestic situation in Russia might change." The minister said he 
was absolutely certain that China and Russia "must and will 
definitely be friends for a long time to come." 
  The minister said that the views of Moscow and Beijing 
"either coincide or are similar" on many very important 
international problems. He stressed that China "is not taking 
part in the arms race or any military alliances. And it neither 
does nor will lay claim to hegemony anywhere or ever -- either 
now or subsequently, when it becomes a powerful country." 
[sentence as received] 
  The head of the Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed a rather 
skeptical view regarding the possibility of a direct transfer of 
the experience of Chinese reforms to Russian soil. "China's 
experience is applicable only to the specific conditions of our 
country. Russia's reality is different from that of the PRC," he 
said. At the same time, the minister expressed readiness to 
develop contacts in the sphere of the implementation of reforms, 
having noted that it is useful for both countries to exchange 
and to borrow experience from one another. He said he was 
certain that "Russia will undoubtedly find a path of development 
suitable to its own reality. It will definitely overcome the 
current temporary difficulties and will be able to restore its 
economy." 
  Qian Qichen admitted that in the conditions of rapid 
development of Russian-Chinese contacts "some problems have 
arisen." The most important is "incidents where a few criminals 
cross the border and engage in criminal activities, or where 
unscrupulous traders sell fake and inferior goods for a quick 
profit." The minister stressed that Chinese Government is 
prepared "to cooperate with Russia in taking legal measures 
against Chinese citizens who violate Russian laws." 
  According to Qian Qichen, the Chinese people "are thinking 
about and are doing only one thing: developing the country's 
economy is their major aim." He stressed the need for the 
gradual implementation of reform while maintaining social and 
political stability and avoiding social unrest. The minister 
dismissed claims that China "is only implementing economic but 
not political reforms" as "misunderstanding." 
  According to Qian Qichen, claims that China has become the 
world's third economic superpower also "do not correspond to 
reality." "We believe that China continues to be among the less 
well-off developing countries and it will take efforts of 
several generations to make it a medium-developed country." The 
minister recalled that the Chinese reforms have been carried for 
"only 15 years." "It will take another 20 to 30 years to create 
a complex of more mature and complete systems," he said.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- China and Russia do not want the 
Korean peninsula to have nuclear wepons and are advocating a 
peaceful resolution of all the issues connected with this. Nor 
do they want any sanctions to be imposed on Korea, so as to 
avoid making the situation more complex. This was stated today 
by Qian Qichen, deputy premier of the State Council who is also 
the foreign minister of the People's Republic of China, during 
his visit to the Moscow State University named after M.B. 
Lomonosov. 
  Replying to questions asked by the university lecturers 
about 
similarities and differences in the approaches of China and 
Russia to the issue of the settlement of the nuclear problem on 
the Korean peninsula, the head of the foreign policy department 
of the People's Republic of China stressed that there are no 
radical differences between Moscow's and Beijing's stands on 
this issue. 
  "We understand Russia's proposal on convening a multilateral 
international conference," Qian Qichen said. At the same time, 
he said, the Chinese side believes that the nuclear problem in 
the DPRK must be resolved within the framework of the dialogues 
which currently exist between South Korea and North Korea, 
between the DPRK and the United States, and between North Korea 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Chinese foreign 
minister expressed the hope that the forthcoming round of talks 
in Geneva between Pyongyang and Washington will open up new 
opportunities to settle these problems.

  [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- "The Russian Defence Ministry 
has launched its full-scale peacemaking operation to overcome 
the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. It is going ahead strictly 
according to the programme and quite successfully," Russian 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said at a press conference here 
today. 
  According to Grachev, all forces and materiel, including 
about 2,300 servicemen, to take part in the peacemaking action, 
are now concentrated in the conflict zone. 
  Grachev also said that "a large number of U.N. observers, 
who 
are carrying out good work", has been functioning in the region. 
He said he wished if other countries also took part in the 
peace-making operation aimed at disengaging the conflicting 
sides and promoting peace in Abkhazia. "We are ready to work 
under the aegis of the U.N. and even under other commands," the 
minister said. Grachev expressed regret that "there are no 
prospects of the U.N. peacemakers' participation in the near 
future". He referred to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's opinion voiced at their personal meeting. 
  According to Grachev, whether the Commonwealth of 
Independent 
States (CIS) will take part in putting end to the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, will be decided at a meeting of CIS 
summit meeting scheduled for September. The minister also said 
it is rather doubtful that any of the CIS states will allocate 
bigger army contingent than Russia. According to him, one could 
speak only about a small peacekeeping detachment. Nevertheless, 
those CIS member-countries, which are only setting up their 
armed forces, could contribute into financing the peacekeeping 
operation in Abkhazia, Grachev said. 
  Touching upon his meeting with the NATO supreme commander in 
Europe, Army General George Joulwan, Grachev named cooperation 
in holding peace-keeping operations as one of the main topics to 
be discussed in future. Among the major trends of such 
cooperation, Grachev pinpointed joint planning and holding 
peace-keeping operations, working out general criteria for their 
material and technical supplies, and military personnel training.

<F P=106> [Report by Arkadiy Zheludkov: "`Hurricane' in Moscow Has </F>
Swept Past"] 
  [Text] A massive operation carried out under the 
leadership of the Regional Administration for Combatting 
Organized Crime [RACOC] and involving the Moscow Criminal 
Investigation Department [MCID], the Economic Crimes 
Administration [ECA], and 20,000 soldiers of the Dzerzhinskiy 
Motorized Rifle Division has ended with almost no results. 
RACOC Press Center staffers explained that, on the eve of the 
operation, several mass media organs reported that an operation 
was being prepared.... 
  But was it only this "public disclosure" which played a part 
in the operation's failure? 
  Having checked out 689 facilities around Moscow and 
practically cordoned off the city (43 Dzerzhinskiy Division 
pickets were on the roads into and out of Moscow), the militia 
detained 2,251 people. Some 759 of the detainees had 
administrative proceedings instituted against them (mostly for 
breaking the city's residence regulations). No criminals were 
found among the detainees and they were all released. Some 
1,053 motor vehicles together with 27 parking lots were also 
inspected during operation "Hurricane." 
  In the opinion of RACOC, the success of this massive 
operation lies in the detection of 119 economic crimes (of which 
8 were committed earlier) and in the closure of 193 commercial 
enterprises for various offenses. A total of 196 commercial 
enterprises, 14 hotels, 36 companies and banks, and four markets 
were checked. A total of 219 crimes were exposed (it is unknown 
what they were, given that, according to information from RACOC, 
criminal proceedings were not instituted). 
  Obviously, a serious discussion of the massive operations 
still lies ahead. But their benefit to the city treasury is 
clear -- as much as 119 million rubles in fines were exacted. 
But this argument is hardly likely to work with taxpayers -- 
much more is spent on maintaining the law enforcement agencies 
and carrying out large-scale actions like "Hurricane." 
  Finally, on the subject of the results achieved. RACOC 
staffers consider that the sheer fact that the criminal elements 
did not turn up at their previously known hangouts is evidence 
that the gangs fear and respect the law enforcement agencies. 
But it is also evidence of something else -- the service for 
the surveillance and analysis of criminal groups works much 
better than the defenders of public order and our security. For 
this reason there is little to rejoice at. Perhaps the only 
people who will be happy are the capital's champions of 
"universal equality," as well they might be now that they can, 
after all, burst into and turn upside down any enterprise in any 
form of ownership.... 
  The reasons for our law enforcement officers' failures and 
their long-term plans for combatting crime will be discussed in 
a conversation with RACOC Leader Vladimir Rushaylo, who has 
kindly agreed to meet our IZVESTIYA correspondent.

  [Text] Kiev -- A plenary sitting of Ukraine's Supreme 
Council began on 28 June. A tentative list of issues that will 
be debated in the period from 28 June to 1 July was approved. 
  At the insistence of Oleh Vitovych, chairman of the 
subcommission for human rights issues, deputies included in the 
session's agenda the issue of temporarily halting the withdrawal 
of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, with 141 votes in favor. The 
Supreme Council Commission for Issues of Defense and State 
Security was charged with preparing this issue for the 
parliament's consideration. 
  In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Oleh Vitovych 
said: "We consider that the largest countries, Russia and the 
United States, should begin the process of disarmament 
throughout the world and that all other states should follow 
their example." In his words, the material and technical 
aspects of "unilateral disarmament" do not benefit Ukraine; none 
of the promises made by Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton at the 
signing of the trilateral agreement with regard to the 
withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine is being fulfilled. 
  In Oleh Vitovych's view, the biggest tactical and strategic 
mistake made by the previous Ukrainian parliament was that its 
deputies "took the liberty of hearing the view of the well-known 
pacifist, Dmytro Pavlychko, who stubbornly forced the issue 
through." Oleh Vitovych also said that he has had a meeting 
with Leonid Smolyakov, Russia's ambassador to Ukraine, during 
which he accused the Russian side of interfering in Ukraine's 
internal affairs, particularly in Crimea. Vitoych considers 
that only nuclear weapons could become the single guarantor of 
peace on Ukrainian lands. He said: "There will be no war in the 
country until the last warhead crosses the Russian border." 
  In Oleh Vitovych's view, the inclusion in the session's 
agenda of the issue on temporarily halting the withdrawal of 
nuclear weapons from Ukraine is proof that the overwhelming 
majority of deputies have seen common sense and that they detest 
President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  People's deputy Serhiy Dovhan, chairman of the Peasant Party 
of Ukraine, expressed the assumption in an interview with a 
UNIAN correspondent that deputies agreed to consider this issue 
because they want information on the state of the withdrawal of 
nuclear weapons and on how the obligations taken on by Ukraine, 
Russia, and the United States during the signing of the 
trilateral agreement are being observed. 
  In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, people's deputy 
Vasyl Durdynets said that the "inclusion in the Supreme 
Council's agenda -- by a small group of deputies -- of such a 
proposal does not in any way mean that the withdrawal of nuclear 
weapons from Ukraine would really be halted." 
  Vasyl Durdynets is counting on the responsibility of those 
who will prepare this issue for the deputies' consideration. He 
also said that the Center deputies' group has still not 
discussed its joint position on this matter. 
  Supreme Council Presidium member Hryhoriy Omelchenko 
stressed 
that "if Ukraine signed the trilateral agreement made by the 
presidents and announced its non-nuclear status, then it should 
be consistent in abiding by this position." 
  Hryhoriy Omelchenko noted that this also means the 
implementation of the trilateral agreement by all three states. 
  The Union of Officers of Ukraine, of which Hryhoriy 
Omelchenko is deputy head, has still not discussed this issue at 
its meeting. 
  At Les Tanyuk's insistence, the issue of using a $500 
million 
dollar credit which was given to Ukraine's agro-industrial 
complex, was also included on the agenda. In Les Tanyuk's 
words, Oleksandr Tkachenko, first deputy chairman of the Supreme 
Council, is directly involved in distributing these funds. 
  After this, deputies began discussing the introduction of 
changes and additions to Article 7 of the Ukrainian law "On the 
Militia". Leonid Borodych, chairman of the Commission for Issues 
of Legality and Law and Order, argued the necessity of 
introducing amendments, and said that the militia had recently 
been used for political purposes and that it is implementing 
someone's social orders. An example is Crimea where, as a 
result of using the militia for purposes other than what it was 
designated for, (protecting the president and his family) crime 
has shown a tendency to increase. It is proposed that an 
amendment be introduced to Article 7 in the following terms: 
"The militia is subordinate to Ukraine's Ministry of Internal 
Affairs and the minister exercises leadership over all militia 
subunits in Ukraine." It is also proposed to form a main 
directorate of Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry in Crimea and 
a main directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the 
cities of Kiev and Sevastopol and in the oblasts within the 
system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
  Leonid Borodych is convinced that the possibility exists of 
introducing such a body in the system of the Internal Affairs 
Ministry without any forcible methods. However, some deputies 
stressed that such a decision could lead to the situation 
between Ukraine and Crimea becoming tense and that is why it is 
necessary to postpone it until either after the second round of 
presidential elections or until after the work on bringing the 
Crimean constitution into line with that of Ukraine's has ended. 
  After the discussion the proposed amendment to the Ukrainian 
law "On the militia" was adopted with a single remark -- the 
directorate which is currently subordinate only to the Internal 
Affairs Ministry will report to the local council about its 
activities.

  [Text] On Tuesday miners of five mines of Ordzhonikidzeugol 
corporation in Yenakiyevo, Donetsk coal basin, went on strike 
demanding payment of delayed wages, disability benefits and 
holiday bonuses. They also demand the dismissal of the general 
director of the corporation Aleksandr Poshtuk. The labor action 
is led by the Independent Miners' Union, one of the biggest in 
Ukraine. 
  According to the local strike committee, miners have not 
been 
paid since April at many facilities. Donetskugol corporation 
has not been paying its employees since May. 
  On Tuesday the Ukrainian parliament was told that the reason 
for the labor action at Pervomaiskugol mining corporation in the 
Lugansk Region was the same. There, miners refused to return to 
the surface after the shift. 
  According to Interfax-Ukraine, the miners' wages are between 
three and five million karbovantsy ($70-$120) a month.

  [Text] Presidential candidate Aleksandr Lukashenko who is 
firmly in the lead after the first round of presidential 
elections in Belarus and three of his campaign officers were 
attacked by police outside his office at the Government House in 
Minsk on Monday [27 June]. 
  Yesterday, the House Management handed Lukashenko the keys 
to 
his office where the anti-corruption commission he led had 
worked before. However, the office was again closed this 
morning. 
  Interior Minister Aleksandr Danko issued an order to provide 
Lukashenko with security guards of the chief state security 
department who accompanied him to his office on Tuesday. 
  In an interview with INTERFAX, Lukashenko said that he was 
told by members of another security unit of the department 
outside the Government House that police were ordered not to let 
him into the building. 
  Lukashenko spoke of a police assault on himself and his 
campaign officers outside the House. All four received minor 
injuries, a fact confirmed by ambulance workers. 
  Lukashenko himself has formally appealed to the Prosecutor 
General for investigating the incident provoked, as he put it, 
by "Interior Minister Aleksandr Danko." 
  Lukashenko who won the biggest number of votes in the first 
round now faces a run-off against Prime Minister Vyacheslav 
Kebich.

  [Text] Tiraspol, BASAPRESS, 25/06/1994 -- Chief of the 
Russian Counter-Intelligence Service, General Colonel Sergey 
Stepashin, and Moldovan Security Minister, General Vasile 
Calmoi, met today with Aleksandr Lebed at the 14th Army Command 
in Tiraspol. They discussed the maintenance of security in the 
region. Stepashin did not specify whether yesterday's 
cooperation agreement pertained to Eastern Moldovan districts. 
Stepashin stated to BASA that the 14th Army 
counter-intelligence service head, Colonel Nikolai Zlygostev, 
was dismissed. Unofficial sources say that Zlygostev was 
dismissed for his relations with the Tiraspol security and in 
particular with the former minister Vadim Shevtsov (Antyufeev). 
The 14th Army command did not deny this allegation. The 
Dniester acting security minister Oleg Gudymo was not allowed to 
take part in the meeting. He waited for Stepashin outside 
command headquarters hoping to plan a meeting with him at the 
Tiraspol Security Ministry building. Stepashin refused to have 
any discussions with the Dniester special services. He told 
reporters that he is visiting Moldova at the Chisinau 
Government's invitation.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 25/6/1994 -- The third plenary 
session of the Parliamentary Assembly of Black Sea Basin 
Countries, recently held in Bucharest, focused on concrete 
aspects of economic collaboration between member states, stated 
to BASA Fiodor Angheli, deputy chairman of the Moldovan 
Parliamentary Commission for Foreign Policy. Angheli declared 
that the elaboration of the regulations concerning the favored 
commercial status in the relations between the Parliamentary 
Assembly member-states is of primary importance. It is also 
vital to elaborate mutually advantageous import-export tariffs 
and to modify the system of license granting. He also mentioned 
that establishing inter bank collaboration relations and 
creating a common bank of the Black Sea Basin countries would 
stimulate trade between them. Angheli considers that the 
transit of goods from Greece and Turkey to Russia and the 
Ukraine would be substantially facilitated by the creation of 
some high-standard services at the Giurgiulesti-Galati frontier 
point. "By participating in the Parliamentary Assembly, Moldova 
has a chance to establish large trade programs through both 
multilateral and bilateral agreements," declared Angheli.

  [Text] At an expanded session of the Foreign Ministry 
collegium, issues concerning the practical implementation of 
President Nazarbayev's concept on the creation of a Eurasian 
Union, as well as the participation of the ministry and its 
foreign missions in tackling the problems resulting from the 
president's speech to the Supreme Kenges. 
  In a report presented by Foreign Minister Saudabayev he 
stressed the importance of Nazarbayev's idea on forming a 
Eurasian Union in the context of strengthening integration 
tendencies in the world, first of all in [word indistinct] 
space, and in the context of strengthening the stability and 
security of states which may become subjects of the Eurasian 
Union. 
  The need for more active participation by the central 
apparatus of the Foreign Ministry and by its foreign missions in 
ensuring wide international promotion of the reforms carried out 
in the Republic was stressed at the meeting. The collegium 
endorsed the planned measures, foremost among which is 
elaboration of our sovereign state's foreign policy strategy. 
  The consultative council's meeting on foreign policy was 
held 
at the Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Yerevan, 28 June. (SNARK) -- Armenian Internal 
Affairs Minister, Vano Siradegyan, announced in an interview 
published today by the "HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN" ("REPUBLIC OF 
ARMENIA") newspaper that Nagorno-Karabakh has been de facto 
incorporated in Armenia. Though the region is the place where 
clash the interests of super- powers, "they cannot ignore the 
organized nation which is ready to fight", said Mr. Siradegyan. 
At the same time, the minister opposed the fanning of "military 
hysteria" in Armenia which, in his opinion,"may discredit the 
state". 
  The major mission of his department the minister called 
preservation of political stability in Armenia until the new 
election campaign. By his words, "Armenia cannot allow itself 
early elections, forced resignations, and other social shocks".

  [Text] Zugdidi, 28 Jun -- The Russian Federation 
peacekeeping forces have deployed heavy artillery (122mm-caliber 
E-30 howitzers) and heavy tanks (T-72 tanks) in the security 
zone of the Georgian- Abkhaz conflict. 
  No peacekeeping force, be it in former Yugoslavia or in 
Africa, is armed with either heavy artillery or heavy tanks 
since no such weaponry is necessary to carry out a peace mission.

  [Excerpts] ELTA reported that according to the figures for 
the first quarter of the current year the expenditure of the 
state social security budget exceeded the revenue by 15.7 
million litas. 
  The increasing number of insolvent enterprises was named as 
the main cause of this. An especially difficult situation has 
developed in June; on 1 June the debt of the insurers [to the 
department of social security -- "Sodra"] reached 200 million 
litas. [passage omitted] 
  The revenue from the state and from state joint stock 
enterprises, budget offices, and organizations have dropped 
significantly. According to the figures presented on 20 June 
the revenue received by the state social security budget 
comprised 71.9 percent of the planned revenue for this month. 
  As a result of this the "Sodra" is unable to pay out 
pensions 
on time and to settle accounts with the pharmacies and 
sanatoriums. On average the payment of pensions in June is late 
by four days. Apart from this the "Sodra" is not able to pay 
debts to the sanatoriums, which on 20 June comprised 500,000 
litas. 
  The total debt of "Sodra" this month is 40.3 million litas.

  [Text] Moscow June 30 (TASS) -- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on the 
results of privatisation's voucher (cheque) phase which is 
ending on Friday [1 July]: 
  "The validity of the privatisation cheque, popularly known 
as 
voucher, expires throughout Russia on July 1. As many as 136 
million privatisation cheques out of 148 million were exchanged 
for shares as of June 20. 
  "Recently, however, the flow of privatisation cheques 
offered 
for exchange has grown and reached an amount of nine million a 
week. So, there is every indication that a very small number of 
vouchers will remain in the possession of people in Russia by 
July 1". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on a new privatisation phase which begins 
on Friday: 
  "It is perfectly evident that the time has come for real 
money, instead of privatisation cheques to come into play. 
Only then privatisation will become effective enough from 
innovation point of view. 
  "A programme for post-cheque privatisation should be 
presented to society in the form of a federal law, because it 
concerns the economic foundations of our entire life". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs excerpts from a privatisation study 
prepared by the Reform Foundation under the direction of 
academician Stanislav Shatalin. 
  "In our view, privatisation was designed primarily to 
promote 
the political interests of an extremely narrow circle of people. 
Comparatively small social groups availed themselves of the 
results of privatisation," the newspaper quotes Shatalin as 
saying. 
  "The advancement of those interests was quite often to the 
detriment of the real requirements of the national economy and 
the population of the country." 
  "One can see no unanimity in evaluations and no accord 
between the results and the proclaimed objectives," the 
newspaper concludes. 
  PRAVDA frontpages an article on the final day of 
voucher-based privatisation. 
  "What has it given to the country? Notorious scandals 
connected with the shady transactions of cheque investment 
foundations, and millions of duped citizens. An in-depth 
analysis of this undertaking is yet to be made." 
  The newspaper runs a letter by a war and labour veteran who 
sums up the preliminary results of his particiation in the work 
of an investment foundation which turned out to be unable to 
accomplished the tasks set to it -- to support the most 
vulnerable sections of the population. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) frontpages an interview with 
Presidential Press Secretary Vyachelslav Kostikov. 
  Touching upon the place of the army in politics, Kostikov 
said: "I do not want to say that the army should be outside 
politics. This is apparently impossible to achieve. But, to my 
mind, the army, as has always been the case, should remain the 
symbol of Russia's national strategic interests and serve them, 
that is, the army should uphold national interests, not narrow 
political ones. 
  "One of the main tasks, facing both the president and, 
indirectly, the army, is to maintain in the coming several years 
the still fragile civic and political equilibrium which has been 
established in Russia following the adoption of a new 
constitution and the signing of the treaty of civic accord". 
  "In view of this, it is very important that the army adhere 
to a normal, calm, and civic position". 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, reporting the entering into force of the 
presidential decree on action to combat organised crime and 
banditry, carries an interview with Russia's acting prosecutor- 
general Aleksey Ilyushenko. 
  "Compared with 1989, crime has more than doubled. Last year, 
2,800,000 crimes were recorded, including more than 500,000 
grave ones -- 30,000 wilful murders, 67,000 heavy bodily 
injuries, more than 220,000 robberies and aggravated assaults," 
Ilyushenko told the newspaper. 
  "The first five months of this year saw 1,094,000 crimes, 
including 216 grave ones. Almost all large cities can be 
reckoned among areas where crime is rampant," Ilyushenko said.

  [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- Talks between Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Foreign Minister of the Yemeni 
Republic Muhammad Salim Basindawa who arrived in Moscow on 
Wednesday, began at the building of the Russian Foreign Ministry 
today. 
  It is expected that later today the head of the Russian 
foreign office will hold talks with South Yemeni emissary -- 
Deputy Secretary General of the Central Committee of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party Saleh Saleh Muhammad. 
  Valerian Shuvayev, head of the section of countries on the 
Arabian Peninsula and the department of the Middle East and 
north Africa of the Russian Foreign ministry, told ITAR-TASS 
about Moscow's position at the talks. 
  These contacts, he said, are being carried out within the 
framework of Russian diplomacy's efforts aimed at reaching a 
ceasefire between the confronting sides in Yemen which would 
become the first step towards halting a bloodshed. 
  All internal problems of this Arab country must be resolved 
at a negotiating table. We are prepared to coordinate our 
actions with all who seek to achieve the same aims, both on a 
bilateral basis and within the framework of the United Nations 
to promote the soonest stopping of the senseless fratricidal 
war, the Russian diplomat pointed out.

  [Text] As before India is interested in military-technical 
and trade-economic cooperation with Russia which "has 
practically turned into an integral element of the Indian 
economy's functioning," Russia's Foreign Economic Relations 
Minister Oleg Davydov reported in his interview with Interfax. 
  In the course of the visit of Indian Prime Minister 
Narasimha 
Rao scheduled for Wednesday the parties are expected to sign 
protocols on cooperation in the field of space research and 
military-technical assistance. In addition, the parties intend 
to undertake certain measures to increase the volume of trade 
which dropped to $1 billion in 1993 compared with $1.3 billion 
the previous year and $5.5 billion in 1990 - the most successful 
year. 
  In his interview with Interfax a top-ranking official of the 
Indian Embassy in Moscow expressed his opinion that lowering of 
turnover in the Russian-Indian trade was caused "predominantly 
by transport difficulties." In particular, after the collapse 
of the USSR, Odessa (the most cargo from India was shipped via 
this city) has become part of Ukraine. However, in the near 
future goods from India will be delivered via the Novorossiysk 
port. 
  The Foreign Economic Relations Ministry (FERM) experts point 
out that India was one of the leading trade partners of the 
former USSR, about 2 percent of the country's foreign trade was 
with this country. Thanks to the procurements made in India the 
USSR was able to import tea (about 70 percent), coffee (60 
percent), black pepper (98 percent), jute and goods made of it 
(more than 90 percent). In addition, the USSR procured a great 
quantity of cotton cloth, medicines, detergents, and perfume. 
  The Soviet Union predominantly exported raw materials (more 
than 65 percent) to India, including oil and oil products, 
fertilizers, and non-ferrous metals. The USSR's share in 
India's foreign trade was about 9 percent. More than 70 various 
industrial facilities were built in India with the assistance of 
the USSR. 
  In 1992-1993 the parties accomplished several measures aimed 
at the development of new conditions for Russian-Indian 
cooperation. In May 1992 they signed an agreement providing for 
settling mutual accounts in hard currency (until that time the 
trade was accomplished on clearing basis). The parties have 
also introduced barter deals. 
  In the course of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to 
India in 1993 the parties reached several agreements on the 
Indian debt. In particular, the debt to the former USSR totaling 
about 320 million rupees (about $10 billion) is to be paid off 
by payments in rupees which are to be spent for the procurement 
of Indian goods. A 45-year postponement in paying off 120 
billion rupees ($3.75 billion) with annual payments in equal 
installments was granted to India (by 1994 Russia has already 
received about $840 million towards India's debt). 
  More than 60 percent of the Indian military has been armed 
thanks to the shipments of Soviet weapons over the last two 
decades. In 1993 armaments and military equipment constituted 
54 percent of Russian export to India. Nevertheless, according 
to Russian experts, Russia has to take serious measures to 
preserve and strengthen its positions on India's arms market in 
as other arms exporters have become more active in that region 
of late.

<F P=106> [Unattributed account of "speech by Russian President B.N. </F>
Yeltsin at reception in honor of military academy graduates" in 
Moscow on 28 June: "It Is Up to You To Reform the Army"] 
  [Text] Comrade generals and admirals, comrade officers! 
  Esteemed representatives of foreign countries' armies! 
  Today, in Moscow's Kremlin, we honor our military academy 
graduates, representatives of our glorious officers corps. 
  Such graduation ceremonies take place each year. A fresh 
cohort of highly skilled professionals joins our Armed Forces 
each year. 
  The Russian Army's hopes are assembled in this splendid 
hall. 
You are among those on whom its might and combat ability will be 
founded. 
  On the whole, Russia's Armed Forces meet the contemporary 
demands as regards ensuring the country's military security. 
  The young Russian Army confirms this not only in the course 
of major maneuvers and strategic exercises. Its units and 
combined units successfully perform peacemaking functions in 
line with our country's international commitments. 
  The main avenue of our military policy is to reform the 
Armed 
Forces. They must satisfy the real needs of the country's 
necessary and adequate defense. 
  Gradually (and I emphasize: gradually) the Army's numerical 
strength will be brought to 1.5 million men. 
  The mechanism for the Army's manpower acquisition will also 
change gradually. We are talking about increasing the 
proportion of servicemen serving on contract. 
  We will continue to give major attention to the development 
of Russia's new military infrastructure and to ensuring that it 
is effectively supplied and organized. 
  We need to learn to pursue a balanced military-technical 
policy. The root of the problem is to ensure that the tasks we 
are resolving should be in line with the real potential of the 
country's economy. 
  It is no secret that today we have limited resources and 
this 
is having an acute impact on the Army. It is that much more 
important to allocate them properly. We will have to reduce the 
categories and modifications of armaments, the backup services 
for them, and the range of munitions, consumables, and spares. 
Diversity in this sphere is an unaffordable luxury. 
  At the same time, however, it is categorically impermissible 
to squander -- under the pretext of cutbacks -- the unique 
scientific and technical potential created within the Armed 
Forces. 
  There are international treaties and agreements. The 
commitments we have made will be honorably fulfilled. But there 
cannot be any question whatsoever of any so-called 
"overfulfillment." 
  This is the president's clear-cut position, this is the 
principled demand made of the Armed Forces' leadership. 
  The majority of those in this hall will soon return to the 
forces. I hope that you have soundly mastered one of the main 
lessons of the science of victory. 
  It is that the Army's strength lies not only in the 
personnel's combat skills, and not only in the extent to which 
the military art has been mastered by commanders and troop 
leaders -- even though there can be no army without this. 
  Its strength is rooted not just in military discipline -- 
even though there can be no army without this, either. 
  The Russian Army has been invincible whenever humanity 
within 
it has gained the upper hand over callousness. Whenever 
commanding officers have realized that each and every one of 
their subordinates is neither a robot nor a blind instrument, 
but a human being. 
  Humanity means neither permissiveness nor mollycoddling. 
Humanity in the Army means persistently teaching each and every 
serviceman to perform his combat task and survive in any 
circumstances. 
  The main point in this process is not to forget your 
subordinates' dignity and to always feel personally responsible 
for their lives. 
  This is the behest of our best troop leaders, this is taught 
to us by the combat experience of our best field commanders. I 
believe that you will not only continue but will also 
consolidate this glorious tradition. It must be honestly 
admitted: We have not been and are not always loyal to this 
tradition, whether in the past or in the present. 
  In a democratic state, the rights and duties of servicemen 
must be defined only by the law. The entire legal basis of the 
Armed Forces' organizational development and activity must be 
brought in line with the Constitution and the fundamental 
provisions of the military doctrine. 
  In order to improve the overall system of Armed Forces 
command and control and strengthen their ties with society, we 
will gradually introduce and strengthen elements of civilian 
control over the process of military organizational development. 
  It is impossible not to mention the system of military cadre 
training at a reception in honor of military academy graduates. 
  We do have a concept for developing the military education 
system. The tuition plans and programs of higher educational 
establishments have been clarified. The training of officers in 
many specialized fields, who are in short supply in the Russian 
Army, has been organized. This work must be continued. 
  The main avenue must be a line of rationally expanding and 
integrating the military education establishments. The quality 
of training must be enhanced by reducing their number. 
  We will continue to give special attention to questions 
concerning social protection for the Armed Forces personnel and 
members of their families, as well as for servicemen in the 
reserve. For those who have spent the best years of their lives 
serving the motherland. 
  We are implementing a program to provide housing for 
servicemen and persons discharged from military service in 
1994-1995. Money allowances and pensions have been increased, 
as have the salaries of the Russian Army's [civilian] workers 
and employees. 
  Additional sources of finance to meet military needs are 
being sought for this purpose, despite all the complexities. 
  It may well be that the Ministry of Social Protection will 
have to create a special department for the affairs of persons 
discharged into the reserve, military invalids, pensioners, and 
veterans. 
  I take advantage of this occasion to also dwell on questions 
concerning the Armed Forces' external activity. 
  This primarily involves the formation of a collective 
security system in the CIS. 
  Nobody and nothing can relieve Russia of its political and 
moral responsibility for the future of countries and peoples 
that have marched in step with the Russian state for centuries. 
  Next comes the creation of a promising European security 
system. 
  We advocate that this system should be all-embracing. It 
should also mean more than just a bloc structure, like NATO. 
  What is needed is a broader partnership system which would 
pool and boost all currently operational mechanisms of the CSCE, 
the European Union, the Western European Union, the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council, and so on. 
  The new edifice of European security is hardly likely to be 
successfully built if its architects try to exclude Russia from 
their plans. But we also need to actively participate in the 
existing institutions for cooperation, not to isolate ourselves 
from them but, on the contrary, to more strongly influence their 
work from within. 
  Proceeding from Russia's special strategic position in 
Eurasia, we must single out the creation of an effective 
security system in the Asia-Pacific region as a special avenue 
of our military policy. 
  We will continue to actively participate in peacemaking 
operations, in the work to monitor armaments and the 
proliferation of nuclear technologies, and, on the whole, in 
ensuring strategic stability in the world. 
  Russia's foreign policy is gathering pace. A few days ago 
our country joined the "Partnership for Peace" 
military-political process. Russia concluded the agreement "On 
Partnership and Cooperation" with the European Union. 
  Attendance at the conference of the world's seven most 
developed states lies ahead. This will be, moreover, 
participation with fully equal rights in political matters. In 
other words, the political eight will begin their work. 
  Each such step offers fresh opportunities to our country. 
This will directly affect the Army. The more efficiently we 
operate, the more real opportunities we will gain to solve its 
urgent problems. 
  The second anniversary of the formation of the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces was marked only a short while ago. But 
its history goes far beyond this date. Today's Army is a direct 
heir of the glorious traditions and truly great victories of the 
Russian host. 
  It covered itself with glory on the ice of Lake Peipus 
[Aleksandr Nevskiy's 1242 victory over the Teutonic knights] and 
at the battle of Kulikovo [Dmitriy Donskoy's 1380 defeat of the 
Mongols], near Poltava [1709 defeat of Sweden] and Borodino 
[1812 victory over Napoleon]. The Russian Army's legendary 
might was augmented by the military feats of Aleksandr Nevskiy, 
Dmitriy Donskoy, Aleksandr Suvorov, Fedor Ushakov, Mikhail 
Kutuzov, and other eminent military leaders. 
  Our forebears' tradition of gaining victory, of defending 
the 
Russian state's freedom and independence with arms in their 
hands, was continued by the Red Army soldiers in harsh battles 
against German fascism. 
  Now, 53 years after the start of the Great Patriotic War, we 
realize the full extent of the grandeur of the feat accomplished 
by our grandfathers and fathers. 
  We give the due credit to the talent of celebrated troop 
leaders like Zhukov, Vasilevskiy, Konev, Rokossovskiy, 
Chernyakhovskiy, and many others. 
  Dear graduates! 
  You are celebrating! I congratulate you with all my heart on 
the successful conclusion of your training! 
  Tomorrow you will return to the ranks and will take on new 
and more onerous duties. I am confident that the personnel of 
units, ships, and combined units under your leadership will 
successfully perform their tasks to defend Russia's state 
interests. 
  On this memorable day I would like to wish the officer 
graduates from foreign armies success in their service. I have 
no doubt that you will retain the warmest memories of the 
academy, of Moscow, of our country and its people. 
  Special thanks are due to the command and teaching staff of 
the military academies. I wish you fresh creative 
accomplishments in your noble work. 
  I wish you all success in your very hard but honorable work 
for the sake of Russia and for the glory of the fatherland! 
  Godspeed, dear graduates! Success and happiness in your hard 
service as officers!

  [Text] Allegations that Russia is hiding some sort of data 
about chemical weapons are "absolutely groundless," stated 
Grigoriy Karasin, Russian Federation Foreign Ministry 
information and press department director, in connection with 
the accusations heard in the course of hearings in the U.S. 
Congress. He advised that the Russian Federation and the United 
Stated exchanged data on their military-chemical potentials on 
the basis of an intergovernment memorandum on chemical weapons. 
"These data are being studied and analyzed by both sides, 
following which Russia and the United States will each carry out 
five inspections at each other's installations. This is provided 
for so that the sides can make sure the received information is 
trustworthy," the Foreign Ministry official stated.

Director Hans Blix, who is in Moscow on an official visit, the 
FIS press bureau has said. The collection of information about 
the proliferation and development of weapons of mass destruction 
has always been among special services' priority tasks, and the 
IAEA draws on intelligence data of the U.S. and British 
intelligence services it has been receiving not only through 
their governments; this is why Mr. Blix is also planning to 
establish close cooperation with the Russian intelligence

  [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- Hans Blix, director of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), met with Director of 
the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Yevgeniy Primakov 
on Wednesday and sources in the SRV indicated that Blix wants 
Russian intelligence information on nuclear non-proliferation 
problem. 
  "The Foreign Intelligence has never concealed that 
monitoring 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons is among our priority 
tasks", a high ranking intelligence official told TASS. 
  He added that the IAEA relies in its activities on the 
information received from us and British secret services not 
only through their corresponding governments, but also directly 
from the intelligence bodies. 
  "It is quite logical that the IAEA director intends to 
establish closer cooperation in the given field with the Russian 
intelligence as well in order to get a more objective picture", 
the official said adding that the "exchange of such information 
is in mutual interests".

  [Text] Hans Blix, general director of the International 
Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA], continues his visit to Moscow. 
Today he met Viktor Mikhaylov, Russian minister for atomic 
energy. Problems of ensuring the safety of weapons-grade 
uranium and plutonium released during the dismantling of nuclear 
warheads were discussed. Other topics under discussion included 
the safety of storing radioactive elements and joint projects to 
ensure safety at atomic power stations. 
  In a conversation with journalists Hans Blix highly 
appraised 
the prospects for the best Russian atomic technological 
processes in the world markets, first and foremost in the area 
of state-of-the-art reactor technology, and the production of 
isotopes and of enriched uranium. 
  The IAEA general director also gave new details concerning 
the North Korean nuclear problem. The agency extended to the 
DPRK technical assistance in the area of development of atomic 
power engineering for peaceful purposes only, checking the 
activities which have been officially notified and the relevant 
nuclear facilities and materials. 
  The IAEA began to suspect Pyongyang of concealing certain 
data and of supplying incomplete and inaccurate data. In an 
attempt to have the situation clarified, the IAEA demanded that 
two new facilities should be made available for inspection. The 
conflict began when Pyongyang refused. 
  So far it is difficult, on the basis of the current data, to 
speculate how close North Korea is to making nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Mikhail Beliy, director of the First Asian 
Department in the Russian Foreign Ministry, told Interfax 
Wednesday that international sanctions against Pyongyang were 
not on the agenda any more as the U.S. and North Korea were 
scheduled to hold talks in Geneva on July 8 and a summit meeting 
of the two Koreas was to be held on July 25. 
  He said that Moscow welcomed the understanding on holding 
the 
first summit of North an South Korea. Beliy noted that this 
idea was not new but until now it had never gone beyond the 
coordination stage. He thought that if all barriers were 
overcome this time, a new page might begin in the relations 
between the two Koreas. 
  Beliy added that Russia still thought an international 
conference on the Korean peninsula had to be held. He explained 
that since the beginning of 1994 three crises had been about to 
break out in the peninsula. When it attenuated somewhat, it 
used to be followed by a stronger one, he said. For this 
reason, Beliy believed, a multilateral conference might work 
where bilateral talks failed. 
  He did not think that the American-North Korean dialog would 
not necessarily be a success because the problems were too 
complicated to be solved quickly. This was the reason why 
Russia would press for an international conference.

  [Correspondent A.Murtazin -- identified by caption] With the 
changes in geopolitical realities, southern Russian has become a 
border region, hence the need for suitable combat-ready troops. 
  [Begin Grachev recording] Along with Transcaucasia, North 
Caucasus is a priority region for us at the moment. We need to 
create a strong district manned with strong mobile and 
land-based forces which are properly armed. [end recording] 
  [Murtazin] From the airport the minister went on to the 
military cantonment where construction of apartments for the 
army officers withdrawn from Germany has been under way for four 
months now. In accordance with the agreement on troop 
withdrawals, the construction is financed by the German side. 
Bulgarian and Russian workers are employed. By the end of this 
year 1,548 apartments will be built. 
  Also today the minister visited the 22d Special Purpose 
Troops Brigade transferred here from Baku two years ago. During 
their first winter here these servicemen had to live in tents in 
the open country. Now their barracks are ready. Soon many of 
them will be moving into new apartments.

  [Text] Moscow is convinced that the Russian peacekeepers 
will give a strong impetus to the political settlement of the 
Georgian- Abkhazian conflict and facilitate the return of the 
refugees, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov told 
Interfax on Wednesday. 
  He also said that had not initiated the peacekeeping 
operation for the sake of some lofty but empty idea. 
"Tranquility and peace in this region is tantamount to stability 
in the Caucasus and the south of Russia, although, of course, we 
are anxious about the Russian guys, who are in the zone of the 
Abkhazian-Georgian conflict now," he said. 
  Pastukhov announced that "the Russian forces which 
constitute 
the nucleus of the CIS peacekeeping operation, have been 
deployed on the basic positions." "They are equipping posts and 
beginning to perform their functions," he said. 
  He said that the local population had given a warm welcome 
to 
the Russian units. "After the arrival of the peacekeeping 
forces, the population's moods changed for the better. There is 
more hope now that combat operations will not be resumed," he 
said. 
  Pastukhov believes that the dramatic problems of the 
refugees 
are in the forefront now. "On the one hand, the return of the 
refugees must not be spontaneous and unorganized. But on the 
other, their comeback must not be delayed any longer," he said. 
  He refused to name the exact number of refugees. He said, 
however, that according to Georgia, more than 250,000 people had 
left Abkhazia. "I visited the Gali Region recently. It is 
empty. The burnt and ruined houses amid the flourishing nature 
of Kolchis make a shocking sight," said Pastukhov.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Mikhail Nikulin from </F>
Tajikistan; from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Announcer Boris Kostenko] Russia's 201st Motor Rifle 
Division has held a tactical exercise in Tajikistan. 
  [Nikulin] This was some exercise. The young tank crews of 
Russia's 201st Motor Rifle Division pitted their skills against 
mountainous conditions, and tested their ability to withstand 40 
degree heat. The latest combat materiel was also tried out. As 
the military usually say in such circumstances, the exercises 
were carried out with great skill and many tactical and combat 
objectives were achieved. 
  But we were interested in something else. The exercise 
coincided with the inter-Tajik talks in Tehran. Furthermore, 
the shooting at practice targets was carried out very close to 
the border. What is this, then? A display of strength or a 
flexing of muscles? 
  [Begin B. Melnik, deputy commander of a tank regiment, 
recording] That cannot be said. We are carrying out routine 
summer combat training. But everybody knows that the officers 
and men of the 201st Motor Rifle Division are stationed on the 
border, are protecting the Tajik border. The 201st Division is 
stationed there together with the Armed Forces of Tajikistan and 
Russia's border troops. So, those who wanted to test the 
division and its muscle already know and feel its power. [end 
recording] 
  [Nikulin] The border where the men of the 201st Division are 
serving with Russian border guards as part of the CIS collective 
peacekeeping forces continues to be unsettled. According to 
authoritative sources, Tajik opposition guerrillas in 
Afghanistan are continuing to transfer their armed formations 
toward the Pamir sector of the border.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuznechevskiy: "Ukraine: Elections </F>
Held, Society Split"] 
  [Excerpts] It would be no exaggeration to say that the 
elections in the Ukraine were followed with much greater 
attention abroad than in the republic itself. The results, I 
have no hesitation in saying, are being awaited impatiently in 
Russia and the United States, Western Europe, and Moldova. But 
even 48 hours later the sluggish post-independence state machine 
has managed to process the voting forms from only 16 of the 27 
electoral districts. Of the votes counted in this partial 
context 35 percent of voters preferred L. Kravchuk and 31 
percent, L. Kuchma. 
  Even before the elections the geographical preference 
pattern 
had been accurately predicted by sociological services: Western 
oblasts prefer the current president, while eastern oblasts 
prefer the main contender for the post. In practice 90 percent 
of Ivanofrankivsk Oblast voters, 80 percent of Lviv Oblast 
voters, 76 percent of Rovno Oblast voters, and 71 percent of 
Volyn Oblast voters who participated in the election preferred 
L. Kravchuk, whereas 82 percent of Crimeans preferred L. Kuchma. 
The former premier has twice as many votes as the president in 
Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. [passage omitted] 
  One of the main conclusions to be drawn is obviously that, 
whoever wins on 10 July, he will not be able to ignore the 
results of these elections. And the main result is that Ukraine 
is split approximately in half. The cold shower which voters in 
eastern oblasts have given L. Kravchuk has shown that his 
reliance on the national radicals in the west of the country is 
leading society into a blind alley. While L. Kuchma, who 
advocates Ukraine's integrity, can no longer realize his slogan 
in practice unless he finds a common languages with the 
population of the western oblasts. 
  All the indications are that unless these two leaders draw 
the appropriate conclusions, the winner at the next elections in 
the Ukraine will be not A. Moroz or B. Lanovoy, but a 
Belorussian [as published] version of Zhirinovskiy. 
  Another conclusion also suggests itself. No matter how the 
10 July second round of elections ends, it can already be said 
that the policy which Leonid Kravchuk has been pursuing since 
the fall of 1991 has not brought success, to put it mildly. 
Reliance on the superficially highly attractive slogans of the 
national radicals in the western oblasts has brought him to 
political disaster, since how else can you assess the activity 
of a political leader who has split his country? 
  The initiator, by his own admission, of the destruction of 
the Soviet Union in December 1991 in Belovezhskaya Forest, L. 
Kravchuk -- following the same logic in his policy -- has split 
Ukraine in 1994. 
  His mistake is that his slogan of absolute independence for 
Ukraine misled the masses of so-called ordinary people. This 
slogan, based on the fact that Ukraine as part of the USSR 
produced 34 percent of the steel, 46 percent of the iron ore, 36 
percent of the television sets, 56 percent of the sugar, and so 
forth, should have confirmed that Ukraine is a rich state. Yet 
this republic was only rich as part of the USSR. Having 
destroyed its links with the other republics, this state with a 
population of 52 million has experienced a vicious two-year 
economic crisis, and all the attributes of state independence 
have been reduced to proud words, state flags, a national army 
uniform, and suchlike. 
  To a certain extent it for this reason (disillusionment) 
that 
the turnout of voters in the Ukrainian capital was so low 
(barely above 50 percent). 
  One way or another all these factors cannot fail to impact 
on 
the second round of the election. What these results will be, 
we will learn 10 July.

Georgiyev: "The General Chose Not To Discuss Politics"] 
  [Text] General George Joulwan, NATO's supreme allied 
commander in Europe, described yesterday's meeting with Pavel 
Grachev as a culmination of his visit to Moscow, saying NATO 
wants to be not only Russia's partner but also its friend. 
True, so far the sides chose not to specify the political 
aspects of this friendship. 
  Joulwan's visit to Moscow was planned long ago and did not 
depend on Russia's signing the Partnership for Peace program. 
Now, as Andrey Kozyrev said at a meeting with the general, the 
visit can be seen as concrete manifestation of Partnership. The 
head of the Russian Foreign Ministry was, as usual, allegoric: 
He compared Russia's joining Partnership to the opening of a 
railway line and Joulwan's visit to the establishment of a 
specific timetable. According to Kozyrev, it is planned to 
include into this "timetable" five to six joint Russian-NATO 
games. 
  In the course of talks between Joulwan and Pavel Grachev 
joint peacekeeping operations were described as a high priority 
in Russia's relations with NATO. Yet, the Russian minister 
believes, the interests of both sides should be reckoned with. 
Questioned how they will be considered in the process of 
consultations, Joulwan preferred not to answer: This is a 
matter for politicians, and he is a military man. Therefore he 
concentrated on practical problems: He reached agreement with 
Grachev on opening NATO's permanent mission with the Russian 
Defense Ministry and the Defense Ministry mission with the NATO 
Allied Command, and setting up an emergency hot line between the 
NATO Allied Command and the Russian Armed Forces General Staff. 
  Russian Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov drew Joulwan's 
attention to difficulties involved in implementing the 
Partnership program: In his opinion, not all politicians in the 
West understand what a new Russia is all about. Lobov sought to 
have his interlocutor believe that the problems of sharing out 
the Black Sea Fleet or Moscow's peacekeeping actions in the 
Transcaucasus and Central Asia do not point to a return to its 
imperial past. Suspicions that Russia continues to develop 
bacteriological weapons must also be cast aside. Partnership, 
according to Lobov, should help Russia cut its military spending 
and release funds for reform.

  [Text] Oslo June 29 TASS -- Russia's cooperation with NATO 
is extremely important in itself but to Norway "it is of special 
interest", Norwegian Defence Minister Jorgen Kosmo told 
ITAR-TASS in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. 
  The agreement, concluded on June 22, on large-scale 
cooperation between Russia and NATO "opens up new possibilities 
for Norway's close cooperation with its nearest neighbour -- 
Russia", Kosmo said. 
  Norway is convinced, the minister said, that "it is possible 
to develop and strengthen Norwegian-Russian contacts in the 
field of defence and security in the best way under the 
Partnership-for-Peace programme". 
  "We are interested in adding specific programmes to the 
Russia-NATO agreement, which could contribute to further 
strengthening goodneigbourly relations between Norway and Russia. 
  "Russia -- a great power with a huge population -- possesses 
an economic potential, nuclear weapons and military might. 
Considering these factors, there is no need for Russia to ask 
for a special place within the framework of cooperation with 
NATO. Russia already holds it due to these circumstances. 
  "Your country does not need to sign a special document to 
specify its special role. Without any special agreements, 
Russia can exert a great influence on the development of the 
Partnership-for-Peace programme and on the political situation 
in Europe as a whole. 
  "It remains for Russia only to act as befits a great power," 
the Norwegian defence minister emphasised.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Kulbitskiy] </F>
  [Text] Bonn June 29 TASS -- Russia has submitted to German 
authorities a list of 40,000 cultural valuables taken out of the 
country during World War Two and the chief negotiator indicated 
that many problems are yet to be solved before a solution is 
found. 
  Russian Deputy Culture Minister Mikhail Shvydkoy told TASS 
on 
Wednesday that Russian experts "have completed intense work to 
compile a true list of our losses" which concern, in particular, 
the Catherine Palace in Pushkino, a palace in Pavlovsk and a 
museum in Orel. 
  Shvydkoy, who is heading the Russian delegation at the 
current restitution talks in Germany, admitted that 
contradictions do exist. Russia opposes the German idea that the 
restitution problem is to be solved by political means and 
insists on a legal settlement. 
  Additionally, "there are many war veterans in Russia to whom 
it will be hard to explain why we have to hand over some 
valuables and get nothing in return. This is the root cause of 
our differences with the German side. We are strongly against 
granting equal rights to the countries one of which is the 
aggressor and other the victim of aggression," Shvydkoy said. 
  He stressed that Germany's valuables brought to the Soviet 
Union by decision of state organisations are Russia's property. 
However, things smuggled out of Germany by private persons must 
be returned. The valuables that belonged to German religious and 
charity organisations were not allowed to be taken out of the 
country, he said. 
  Another problem is the articles that belonged to individuals 
or third countries. For example, if Germany had brought 
something from France and later it was brought to Russia, these 
things cannot be treated as German property. "We are seeking to 
make the process of restitution legal without damaging Russia's 
interests," Shvydkoy said. 
  "We cannot agree with the German side that this process will 
not be compensatory. It must be a road with two-way traffic. 
The return of valuables from Russia must be linked to the 
return of valuables from Germany," he continued. 
  Additionally, if Germany cannot trace a particular thing and 
is ready to give up the search, it must pay compensation which 
will be used to support Russian culture. "We are strongly 
against using this money in other spheres, that is trading a 
painting for a kilo of sausage or equipment for a brewery. Our 
commission considers it barbaric," Shvydkoy said.

  [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- On the eve of a meeting with 
Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh 
scheduled for July 4, head of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service [FCS] of Russia Sergey Stepashin informed that this 
would be the first personal contact between chiefs of 
counterintelligence of the two countries. 
  Sergey Stepashin was today a guest of the club of 
editors-in- 
chief of Russian news media at the ITAR-TASS news agency in 
Moscow. 
  The director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
elaborated that one of the aims of Louis Freeh's visit to Russia 
would be the opening of a FBI office in Moscow. 
  Sergey Stepashin also said that the FBI director was 
concerned about an access of Russian mafia to nuclear technology. 
  Incidentally, the director of the Federal 
Counterintelligence 
Service of Russia himself rules out such a possibility. He 
intends to ask his American counterpart to present documents or 
information confirming the danger of nuclear terrorism in 
Russia, otherwise FBI's interest in this problem may be 
interpreted by the Russian opposition as an aspiration of the 
United States to establish control over nuclear objects on the 
territory of the Russian Federation. 
  It is noteworthy that the American side does not offer the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service of Russia to open its office 
in the United States. According to Sergey Stepashin, such an 
agreement was reached only with Germany, France, Czech Republic 
and Poland. 
  In addition to meetings with the director of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service of Russia, chief of the U.S. Federal 
Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh also intends to meet with 
Yuriy Baturin, assistant to the Russian president on national 
security, and Russian Interior Minister Viktor Yerin.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "FBI Is Ready To Take on </F>
Russian Mafia"] 
  [Text] Washington -- FBI Director Louis Freeh will spend 
the coming week in a number of Central and East European 
countries. Naturally, he is also visiting Moscow. He cannot 
fail to visit Moscow. Because the main topic of his visit is 
"Russian crime." 
  In this instance you cannot avoid using inverted commas. 
"Russian crime" is just a term. Its meaning is broader than the 
words which reflect the phenomenon. Russian crime does not mean 
crime in Russia. Nor does it mean crime committed by Russians. 
It does not even mean crime which has carved out a niche for 
itself in Russia. 
  The topic of the visit by L. Freeh and five other ranking 
representatives of the Department of State, the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, and the Department of the Treasury will be the 
peculiar status of organized crime in the world, which has now 
become a fact of life following the collapse of the communist 
system. 
<H5>  Everything Can Be Bought </H5>
  "The Criminal World," a book published recently by Claire 
Sterling, a journalist specializing in organized crime, recounts 
that, a few hours after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 
1989, Giovanni Tanomento, a well-known Sicilian mafioso who was 
living in (West) Berlin at the time, received an instruction 
from his bosses to immediately go on a buying spree in East 
Berlin. "What exactly should I buy?", the mafioso asked in 
amazement. His boss replied: "Everything. Restaurants, 
discotheques, pizzerias, everything." 
  Judging by initial results, the end of the Cold War was a 
boon not so much for capitalism, democracy, and the 
market-oriented economy as for organized crime. In a world of 
crumbling authority, in a world where people without money, 
capital, or assets either owned or temporarily controlled 
immense amounts of wealth on a quite tenuous basis, in this 
world of chaos and disorganization there has proved to be no 
more organized force than crime. 
  The wholesale arrival of democracy and the weakening or 
disappearance of carefully guarded national borders has 
facilitated the international activities of criminal structures 
to an even greater degree. It become apparent at the recent 
U.S. Senate hearings from evidence given by leaders of the FBI, 
Germany's criminal investigation police, and the Russian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs that the upsurge in organized 
postcommunist crime has caught everyone unawares. Many experts 
believe that the pooling of resources and finances by Sicilian 
godfathers, Colombian drug barons, Japanese "Yakuza" gangsters, 
and Russian gangs could turn the world into a nightmare compared 
to which "teetering on the brink of nuclear war" would seem like 
a transient problem. 
  Recent history provides several examples of organized crime 
subsuming whole states. At the U.S. Senate hearings, M. 
Yegorov, Russian deputy internal affairs minister, repeatedly 
answered questions on whether criminals could reach the very 
highest levels of the Russian administration. The general from 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs did not deny the possibility 
that organized crime could place its own protege in the Duma or 
the Federation Council, but he assured the senators that for the 
foreseeable future the Kremlin was out of the criminals' reach. 
  In the opinion of C. Sterling, whose book "The Criminal 
World" we have already cited, Russia has become "the world 
capital of organized crime." Without denying this threat, the 
FBI director described such views as "exaggerated and unfounded" 
at a news conference just before his departure. 
<H5>  He Did Not Read the Decrees [Dekrety] </H5>
  The FBI director refused to comment on Russian President 
B.N. 
Yeltsin's recent decree on urgent measures to combat crime. 
Journalists asked L. Freeh whether this decree, with all its 
major restrictions on citizens' civil rights, would really be 
useful in overcoming organized crime. The director preferred to 
answer that he had not had time to read the decree. 
  I have reason to believe that the text of the decree has 
been 
made available to the FBI leadership. It is likely that L. 
Freeh preferred not to complicate relations with his hosts on 
the eve of his important visit. 
  On 4 July, Independence Day, one of the most important and 
solemn U.S. public holidays, Louis Freeh will open an official 
FBI mission in Moscow. It will not be a purely representative 
mission. A considerable number of Russian nouveaux riches, 
happy and shameless possessors of dirty millions, are laundering 
their money in America or through banking structures directly 
linked to America. Russian law enforcement organs do not have 
access to bank secrets in the West and are unlikely to have such 
access in the future. The FBI has far wider powers. 
  The FBI's Moscow bureau will enable rapid communications to 
be established between the two countries' police forces, as well 
as ensuring that mutual assistance can be offered. At his news 
conference, the director clearly intimated that he regards the 
possibilities as limitless, but much will depend on how 
day-to-day work progresses, how far the two sides can trust each 
other, and how noticeable the results are. 
  The second objective of the trip, the program for which 
includes visits to Ukraine and Belarus, and also Poland, the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria, will be helping to 
coordinate these countries' police services. Once fairly close, 
the relations between East European states in this sphere have 
degenerated into exclusivity and mutual mistrust literally 
within a matter of months. L. Freeh hopes that it will be 
possible to restore the professional contacts which are very 
important in the struggle against organized crime. To this end 
the United States is planning joint courses for the police 
forces of East Europe. 
  Many experts consider it fortunate for the international 
community that criminal groups are by nature not inclined to 
coordinate their activities, they are characterized by an 
insurmountable urge to delineate zones of influence. It is no 
surprise that, following the collapse of communism, old criminal 
structures are being squeezed out by new, more brutal, and more 
aggressive structures. 
  During the visit the U.S. delegation will suggest to its 
East 
European partners that they exploit this fact by establishing a 
computerized data base. This information will have to be 
protected from criminal groups which in many countries have 
their own network of paid agents in the police, the courts, and 
Prosecutor's Offices. 
<H5>  Everything Is Still in the Future </H5>
  As a representative of the country which has the longest 
(and 
possibly the most successful) record of combating organized 
crime, L. Freeh warned against unrealistic hopes. He said it 
would probably never be possible to defeat mafia structures on a 
national and international scale once and for all. The task was 
to drive organized crime into a corner, deprive it of its 
international scope, and severely restrict its potential to move 
funds around.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Davydov, Russian foreign economic relations </F>
minister: "Russia and the EC: the Corfu Meeting"] 
  [Text] The agreement on partnership and cooperation 
between Russia and the European Community signed by President 
Yeltsin on the Greek island of Corfu can without exaggeration be 
called a document without precedent for post-confrontation 
Europe. After nearly two years of intense negotiations, the 
main parameters and conditions for new cooperation between 
Moscow and the economic union of 12 leading European states were 
finally defined. 
  The necessity of concluding such an agreement was prompted 
by 
new geopolitical realities. The breakup of the USSR, the 
disintegration of the socialist camp and with it of the 
notorious Comecon, reoriented foreign economic activity by 
Russian enterprises toward the EC. Their performance and the 
condition of our economy as a whole became increasingly 
dependent on access to European markets. 
  Today the EC is Russia's largest trade and economic partner. 
In 1993 it accounted for more than 35 percent of its trade with 
distant foreign lands, including 36 percent of Russian exports 
and 35 percent of imports. The EC countries are the main 
investor in Russia's economy while the community's market is the 
main market for Russian strategic exports. We buy a substantial 
part of agricultural products, machinery, and other requisite 
goods in the EC. 
  Apparently in the future the EC region, which accounts for 
more than two-fifths of world trade, will be playing the role of 
Russia's leading business partner. Experts estimate that after 
the Community's expansion with the Scandinavian countries and 
Austria, its share in trade with Russia could increase nearly 
1.5 times, reaching 44 percent. One should also not forget that 
our former Comecon partners -- East European countries -- are 
standing on the EC threshold and in the longer term the 
Community could be joined by the Baltic states. So far only 
Switzerland and Albania are the sole European states to the west 
of the CIS external borders that are not asking to be admitted 
"under the roof" of the Community. 
  In its turn Russia is the largest political and trade 
partner 
for the EC among the countries of the former USSR. It makes up 
approximately 85 percent of EC trade with the CIS countries and 
some 70 percent of all Western commitments on credit, technical 
and humanitarian assistance to the former Soviet republics. In 
recent months a large number of EC member states, interested in 
establishing long-term links, have hastened to Russia. This 
also includes investment cooperation. 
  At the same time, the EC's and Russia's movement toward each 
other has until recently been substantially hampered by the 
absence of a corresponding legal regime while trade barriers 
with respect to Russian goods such as uranium and aluminum even 
gave some experts cause to talk about a new "iron curtain." 
After all, the agreement, inherited from the Soviet era, 
between the USSR and the EC and Euratom on trade, commercial, 
and economic cooperation, signed in 1989, was geared toward 
interaction between fundamentally different economic systems. 
It was rather primitive, addressing only matters of a trade 
regime, moreover in a spirit discriminatory to Russia. Therefore 
the need to conclude a new agreement that would extend to Russia 
rules uniform for all Community countries has grown urgent. 
  What does the Corfu agreement mean for Russia? One of the 
conditions enshrined in it is the creation, after 1998, of a 
zone of free trade with the EC. This involves not only a free 
flow of goods but also freedom of incorporation, trade in 
services, and capital movement. It is also important that the 
EC has recognized Russia as a country with a transitional 
economy, abandoning its treatment as a country with a state 
trade system. This underlies the EC's abolition of former tough 
trade discrimination. Furthermore, for the first time in 
international legal practice, Russia, which is not a party to 
GATT, has managed to incorporate into the agreement direct 
references to a number of its key provisions. As a result, the 
EC will fully lift quotas on imports from Russia which up until 
recently covered more than 600 goods. 
  As far as the political dialogue between Russia and the EC 
goes, the agreement stipulates the establishment of a system of 
consultations on the entire range of international and economic 
problems. To this end meetings between the president of Russia 
and the EC leadership will be held at least twice a year. 
Dialogue at ministerial level will proceed within the framework 
of a Cooperation Council to be set up. A Parliamentary 
Cooperation Committee is also to be formed with deputies of the 
Russian Federal Assembly and members of the Europarliament. 
  Today the main goal set forth by Russia at the start of 
negotiations with the EC has been accomplished: Moscow has 
managed to create favorable conditions for economic interaction 
with the "club" of leading European countries. Russia has 
stepped over the threshold of Europe.

  [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- Chairman of the Duma 
Parliamentary Committee for Information Policies, Mikhail 
Poltoranin, described the idea of extending the Federation 
Council's term in office as "an arrogant proposal." 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS Poltoranin said that the 
prolongation of the powers of power structures can be discussed 
on condition that certain guarantees are fulfilled and important 
problems faced by the Russian people are resolved. 
  Poltoranin reminded of the fact that before the agreement on 
civic accord was signed, he had addressed lawmakers of the State 
Duma, suggesting that this agreement be supplemented by 
commitments made by each branch of power for a concrete period 
of time. In his opinion, this agreement should include a 
concrete plan of actions of power structures for the second half 
of 1994, the entire 1995 and the first half of 1996. Trade 
unions might have pledged to refrain from strikes during this 
period, Poltoranin said. 
  The public chamber might assume control over the fulfillment 
of commitments, including the dismissal of the branch of power 
which fails to fulfill its commitments. On the other hand, if 
the economic and social situation stabilises by the middle of 
1996, he problem of crime in Russia is resolved and the 
necessary legislative basis created, the public chamber might 
initiate the prolongation of the powers of the president, the 
government and the parliament, since "enough is as good as a 
feast," as the saying goes, Poltoranin said. 
  Poltoranin believes that a congress of social forces might 
be 
convened which would appeal to Russians to hold a referendum 
which would be a legitimate basis for the prolongation of 
powers. Having noted that this idea was never realised, 
Poltoranin added that "being in high posts without making 
commitments and being detached from Russia's public and social 
life is, at least, strange."

"Is a Law a Secondary Matter?"] 
  [Text] On the eve of its six-month anniversary, the State 
Duma has drawn up a report on work it has done. 
  By the end of last week, the chamber had considered 136 
bills. 
  It is State Duma committees that bear the brunt of 
legislative sponsorship -- they have drawn up 63 bills. 
Individual deputies have sponsored 33 bills; the government, 
28; the president, 11; and the Constitutional Court, 1. This 
regards what has been done "in gross," whereas the output of 
more or less finished products is fairly modest. In all, 15 
laws have been passed (of them, seven have already been signed 
by the president, and the others are with the Federation 
Council). Around 20 bills have been approved in the first 
reading and one has passed the second reading. 
  An overwhelming majority of the approved laws concern the 
socioeconomic area. On one hand, this is a package ensuring the 
functioning of the economy: the budget plan, the laws on 
changes in payments to state extra-budget funds, on state 
foreign borrowings and credits. On the other, a package on 
social safety nets: on raising the minimum wage and on 
pensions. Typically, the government has lobbied for both the 
economic and social-populist bills. 
  The deputies have passed at their own initiative the laws on 
their status and on the procedure for the coming into force of 
laws enacted by the Federal Assembly. This list also includes 
the related law on the Constitutional Court, which the deputies 
see as a guarantee of the preservation of parliamentarianism. 
  Far from all committees have shown equal lawmaking zeal. 
According to an established tradition, the main burden has been 
shouldered by the legislation committee under Vladimir Isakov 
from the Agrarian Party of Russia [APR]. Its record includes 
three laws already passed, four laws approved in the first 
reading, and 12 decrees. The budget committee under Mikhail 
Zadornov from "Yabloko" is second. Third place is shared by the 
security committee under Viktor Ilyukhin from the Communist 
Party and the committee on labor and social protection under 
Sergey Kalashnikov from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
[LDPR]. The relatively small defense committee under Sergey 
Yushenkov from "Russia's Choice" has two bills that have passed 
the first reading and two decrees to its credit. One law and 14 
decrees have been "churned out" by the committee on the 
organization of the State Duma's work under Vladimir Bauer from 
"Russia's Choice." 
  The performance of these six committees can be considered 
effective, or at least noticeable. As for the rest, they 
clearly do not bother themselves too much with lawmaking. Seven 
State Duma committees each have submitted for consideration only 
one bill in six months. They include the committee on 
agricultural matters (Aleksandr Nazarchuk, APR); on industry, 
energy, and transport (Vladimir Gusev, LDPR); on international 
affairs (Vladimir Lukin, "Yabloko"); on natural resources and 
nature use (Nikolay Astafyev, LDPR); on the affairs of women, 
family, and youth (Galina Klimantova, "Women of Russia"); on 
information policy and communications (Mikhail Poltoranin, 
"Russia's Choice"), and on geopolitics (Viktor Ustinov, LDPR). 
  But even this is not the limit of the deputies' "zeal." Four 
State Duma committees have failed to propose a single bill or a 
draft decree, whereas the others limited their creative work to 
drafting one decree or two. 
  Two "national" and all three "international" committees (on 
international affairs, the CIS, and geopolitics) have failed to 
find their legislative niche. Nor has the existence of three 
economic committees so far been justified by "prolific" 
lawmaking -- two of them (on economy and on privatization) have 
kept an extremely low profile. It seems that the 
overspecialization of parliamentary committees (that also have 
subcommittees inside) has only brought about an increase in 
offices and titles for the deputies. 
  If we assess lawmaking from the point of view of party 
affiliation, the first striking feature is sluggish work by the 
Party for Russian Unity and Accord. Which is strange, because 
the faction has brought together many deputies from among civil 
servants who are objectively interested in making laws that 
would "fit their size." The contribution of "Russia's Choice" 
also falls short of the faction's numerical strength or its 
potential intellectual capabilities. The agrarian lobby is 
acting aggressively and competently, but only within the range 
of their professional problems. The communists' work in the 
parliament boils down primarily to good attendance of meetings, 
hearings, and other "events." The LDPR faction proceeds from 
the assumption that laws being passed by the current State Duma 
will not be adhered to all the same, so it exploits its presence 
in the State Duma only for political horse-trading. 
  By the time of its recess (in July), the lower chamber plans 
to consider around 30 bills "of primary state importance." They 
include the draft laws "On the Ombudsman," "On the Counting 
Chamber," "On Workers Collectives," "On the State Privatization 
Program," and "On Civil Service." The preparation of the Labor 
Code will be delayed for an indefinite period along with the law 
on the guidelines of economic reform.

  [Text] Vladivostok June 29 TASS -- During their tour of the 
Kamchatka Peninsula, the Sakhalin region and the Maritime 
territory, members of a State Duma delegation confirmed that 
Russia's Far East needed a special economic status, according to 
Ivan Rybkin. The speaker of parliament's lower house addressed 
on Wednesday a news conference, summing up results of the 
lawmakers' trip. 
  When asked by TASS about the possibility of granting such a 
status, Rybkin said the Duma intended to back the region's 
legislative initiatives on the issue. 
  "The defence of our eastern borders is to be reasonable and 
sufficient. Proceeding from this principle, we should help the 
Far East in every possible way with material and technical 
resources so that local residents could not feel deprived", the 
Duma chairman believes. 
  Speaking of his visit to the South Kuril islands, Rybkin 
expressed support of their residents' aspiration to retain these 
economically beneficial territories.

"Novosibirsk Leaders Do Not Believe Rybkin's Promises"] 
  [Text] State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin has met in Moscow 
with representatives of Novosibirsk Oblast trade unions who 
asked the speaker to discuss the socioeconomic situation in the 
region. Your SEGODNYA correspondent has learned that they 
informed Ivan Rybkin that the production slump in the oblast has 
"reached critical mass," beyond which "a disintegration of 
technological links sets in," and urged the speaker for taking 
"effective measures." 
  For his part Ivan Rybkin promised to help resolve the most 
acute problems in order to stabilize the economic situation in 
the region. However, "What this help is going to be and when 
could it be forthcoming was hard to understand from what Mr. 
Rybkin said," stated Viktor Babakov, head of the oblast's Trade 
Union Federation. He thinks that "promises cannot improve 
things" today, all the more so because they were given to 
Novosibirsk people at various levels in the past and have not 
been acted upon up to now. In the meantime enterprises are 
grinding to a halt in the oblast one after another, forcing 
nearly 30 percent of the personnel to go on administrative 
vacations. 
  Mr. Babakov stated in this connection that the oblast's 
trade 
unions demand that the Russian Government immediately send an 
authoritative commission to resolve the socioeconomic problems 
on the spot. The Novosibirsk trade unions intend to insist on 
modifying the tax policy and adopting a state employment program.

  [Text] Moscow, 30 Jun -- Interaction between the State Duma 
and the legislative assemblies of the Far Eastern and Siberian 
regions will reach a new and more specific level of law-making 
activities now that a delegation of the lower chamber of the 
Federal Assembly led by State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin has 
concluded its five-day working trip there. Rybkin said this to 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent at Vnukovo-2 airport today on the 
parliamentarians' return to Moscow. 
  Ivan Rybkin noted that a plan will be drawn up on the 
results 
of the trip to enable the deputies who were members of the 
chamber's delegation to start work on new laws needed by the 
regions visited. 
  He stressed that some regions of Siberia and the Far East 
have drawn up draft laws dealing with problems most topical for 
them and have sent them to the Duma as a legislative initiative. 
In particular, Ivan Rybkin reported, in the very near future a 
draft law on the status of Maritime Kray may be submitted to the 
Duma. 
  Ivan Rybkin also noted that the State Duma -- jointly with 
the Russian president and government and the regions of Siberia 
and the Far East -- will tackle the issue of railway and 
electric power tariffs. He stressed that now this is one of the 
most serious factors affecting the economic emergence of Russian 
territories. The Duma speaker said: "It is absolutely obvious 
that these issues need to be settled by the state."

<F P=106> [From "Exclusive" report No. 26 of 29 June] </F>
  [Text] SHAYMIYEV: TATARSTAN SHOULD REVITALIZE ECONOMY 
TOGETHER WITH RUSSIA 
  Top leaders of Tatarstan often appear on Interfax-Exclusive. 
The interest in the politicians is quite understandable: 
political analysts believe that the relationship between Moscow 
and Kazan, which for over two years demanded a special status in 
the federation, as well as their treaty on the separation of 
powers signed at the beginning of the year can serve as a model 
for the revival of the Russian Federation. This time Interfax 
interviews the president of the republic Mintimer Shaymiyev. 
  INTERFAX: Five months have passed since the signing of the 
treaty between Russia and Tatarstan. Do you think it has 
influenced processes in Russia as a whole and the attitude of 
the federal government to territories? 
  SHAYMIYEV: Yes, undoubtedly. The treaty with Tatarstan 
reduced to naught the prospect of Russia developing as a 
unitarian state. This is an important political asset, first of 
all for Moscow itself. Now everyone believes that the 
federation can be asymmetrical. This is not just somebody's 
whim, but a reality. The federal government has started signing 
treaties with republics. Moreover these are not standard 
agreements, they take into account the specific features and 
possibilities of each republic. These differences prompt the 
level of dividing powers and the nature of relations between the 
federal government and territories. 
  But we still will have to evaluate the true meaning of the 
treaty. When Russia starts working to harmonize the 
constitutions of the republics with the federal constitution and 
the matter is raised in relations with Tatarstan, then we are 
going to see the strength of the treaty. It was signed on the 
basis of the recognition of two constitutions, which means that 
Kazan has the right to demand the adjustment of certain articles 
of the federal constitution to its own. That is why I think 
that when future agreements are going to be signed with 
republics special attention is going to be paid to harmonizing 
constitutions on the basis of mutual compromise. 
  INTERFAX: Do you think there has been any decentralization 
of power in the Russian Federation or the voice of local leaders 
remains inaudible and insignificant? 
  SHAYMIYEV: There has been a change of the situation in this 
respect too. Local leaders are now being heeded. Probably the 
explanation to this is that in the absence of a clear concept of 
economic reforms, territorial or ethnic policies local leaders 
had to assume responsibility for the construction of a 
law-governed state. Today they are no less experienced in this 
than the federal authorities and offer their own versions of 
economic programs which are no worse. 
  INTERFAX: Before signing the treaty with Moscow Tatarstan 
tried to notably amend, if not openly dissociate itself with 
Russian economic reforms. Now, on the contrary, the leaders of 
the republics more and more often speak of the need for close 
interaction with Russia. Programs that used to be local, such 
as the construction of an oil refinery or a bridge across the 
Kama or the reconstruction of an airport, are becoming joint 
programs. Why? 
  SHAYMIYEV: The main reason is the high degree of integration 
of the Tatar economy in the federal one which we have never 
denied. When two years ago Tatar leaders chose their own 
strategy of reforms, they stressed that the republic is not 
leaving the common economic space, therefore sooner or later it 
Tatarstan going to face the same difficulties as the rest of the 
federation. We managed to prevent a total economic collapse but 
it was impossible to avoid general economic difficulties. The 
main thing is that we prevented the pauperization of the 
population. 
  The stage of "softly" entering the market is over and today 
Tatarstan faces the need for radical changes which does not mean 
the renunciation of social programs. And now the federal 
leadership is determined to take more resolute steps in 
reforming the economy and our views largely coincide. 
  The latest package of economic decrees of President Boris 
Yeltsin is aimed primarily at livening up production which is 
also our strategic task. A series of Tatar decrees is in the 
making and their idea largely coincides with the federal one. 
  However, Kazan can afford even more radical steps: to 
support government-owned as well as private companies, impose 
softer taxes and revise the credit policy. Expensive federal 
credits can be a temporary remedy, but they will inevitably make 
the republic a debtor. 
  There is a true crisis of mutual debts in the Russian 
Federation and Tatarstan now. Therefore we stake on the broad 
use of promissory notes. They have proved useful guaranteeing 
the turnover of means in the republic and holding back the 
decline in production. But much as we would want we cannot 
change the situation singlehanded. 
  Tatarstan should revitalize the economy together with 
Russia. 
And such prospects are appearing today: the federal government 
intends to support our local programs by offering guarantees to 
foreign investors and financing joint projects. This does not 
undermine the interests of Tatarstan in any way. For instance, 
the controlling interest in an oil refinery is going to belong 
to Kazan while guarantees of the federal government will help 
attract foreign investments and accelerate the reconstruction of 
the facility. 
  The construction of YeLAZ (an auto plant in Yelabuga, 
Tatarstan) implied the involvement of the federal government 
from the very start. We can restore KAMAZ auto works after the 
fire only through joint efforts. Russia is getting foreign 
credits and Tatarstan has the right to count on a definite share 
of them. 
  INTERFAX: Analysts believe that when Yeltsin launched 
reforms, Russia started becoming less and less controllable. 
Don't you think your radical steps can have the same result? 
  SHAYMIYEV: No. At the first stage Kazan intends to continue 
government regulation of the market. In corporatized companies 
the controlling interest will remain in the hands of the 
government which is going to be able to influence their 
operation. 
  While supporting small and medium-sized businesses the 
government will control the situation, regulate tax rates and 
help effective plants with credits, but not keep inefficient 
ones afloat. In the future government control should be reduced 
to credit and tax policies. We are gradually moving in that 
direction. 
  On the other hand, the government does not think of 
curtailing social programs even though it faces the difficult 
task of combining the incompatible: easing the tax burden and 
security budget spending. 
  INTERFAX: Are you sure your initiatives are going to be 
regarded adequately and decrees carried out instead of being 
blocked? 
  SHAYMIYEV: So far we have not had unimplemented decrees.

<F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Mikhaylin: "What Are You To Be Called </F>
Now?"] 
  [Text] Kazan -- Farid Mukhametshin, chairman of the 
Supreme Council of the Republic of Tatarstan, has sent Boris 
Mironov, chairman of the Russian Committee for the Press, a 
letter protesting at "the Russian mass media's arbitrary use of 
the name of the Republic of Tatarstan." The letter stated that, 
in accordance with the constitutions of Russia and Tatarstan, 
the republic should be called precisely Tatarstan, and not 
Tataria. In the republic Supreme Council chairman's opinion, 
Tataria is associated with the traditions of the past decades of 
Soviet Tataria, when official ideology and toponymy took no 
account of the national peculiarities of the peoples living on 
Russia's territory. 
  Boris Mironov's letter in reply to this states: This 
question has no bearing on the problems of sovereignization or 
respect for national dignity. In this instance it is a question 
only of the conformity with linguistic laws of old names which 
are an organic part of the Russian language and to which the 
population is accustomed. 
  The reply goes on to state that official materials published 
in the press must use the names adopted at state level by each 
republic or state taken separately -- which also applies in full 
to the Republic of Tatarstan. The Russian Committee for the 
Press intends, for its part, to promote precisely this approach 
in press practice.

  [Text] Russia plans to set up a huge military district in 
the Northern Caucasus complete with mobile and other forces and 
powerful weaponry. 
  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev in an interview with Interfax 
in Rostov-on-Don on Wednesday said that everything had been done 
in the past two years to turn the North Caucasian Military 
District into an army grouping "capable of conducting combat 
operations" to defuse small or big conflicts. 
  Grachev said the district would also have to solve domestic 
tasks in line with Russia's defense doctrine which provides for 
the armed forces and Interior Ministry troops to conduct joint 
security operations. 
  In this connection, he said that if regional security forces 
were unable to cope with their duties, Russian troops would take 
part in cracking down on "terrorist groups" which had mushroomed 
in the region. 
  The minister is at the start of a regional tour to inspect 
troops deployed in the Northern Caucasus. He plans to visit 
army units and meet leaders of the region where Russian troops 
are deployed. 
  On Thursday Grachev is scheduled to visit Anapa, 
Novorossiysk 
and Makhachkala. Nor does he rule out visiting Abkhazia "if any 
changes occur in the area of the conflict" between Georgia and 
Abkhazia.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Batygin: "I Want to Talk to People. </F>
The President Spent Yesterday at Work in the Moscow Region"] 
  [Text] B. Yeltsin's schedule began in the morning with a 
visit to Lyuberetskiy Rayon. 
  "It isn't working out right," he joked during a conversation 
with the journalists accompanying him. "I have been to Tula, to 
Amur Oblast, I have been to the south and the north as well, but 
I rarely get to visit the Moscow region..." 
  As Boris Nikolayevich explained, he has several aims during 
his tour of Moscow Oblast. The first is to visit the Soyuz 
Science-and-Production Association in Lyuberetskiy Rayon, which 
is one of the flagships of the country's defense industry. In 
the afternoon the president was due to have meetings with rural 
workers in Ramenskiy Rayon. 
  "I want to talk to people and find out what their thoughts 
and concerns are," B. Yeltsin said. 
  In the morning the president's helicopter touched down at 
the 
city of Dzerzhinskiy. The science-and-production association 
there, which was created in 1947 to develop compound solid fuels 
for strategic missiles, operational-tactical missiles, and 
anti-air missiles, ballistite propellant for the artillery, and 
so forth (it would take a full page to carry on listing the 
association's "merits"), has a mighty scientific and technical 
potential. Under the conversion program the association is 
presently developing and producing synthetic diamonds and tools 
based on them, industrial explosives, aerosol fire 
extinguishers, medicinal preparations, and much other "peacetime 
output." 
  Civilian output now represents 70 percent of the 
association's total volume. Unfortunately, even a "firm" as 
powerful as this cannot boast of stability because in the tough 
conditions of the reforms its process of becoming established is 
fraught with considerable difficulties. The scientific nucleus 
at Soyuz consists of dozens of doctors and candidates of 
sciences but its "think tank" also requires renewal and support 
today. For example, half a billion rubles are needed for the 
training of scientific staff while the upkeep of the test and 
experiment base will cost the budget 5.4 billion. 
  It emerged that Boris Nikolayevich's interest extends not 
just to the specific concerns worrying the Soyuz collective. 
The leaders of defense enterprises in the Moscow Oblast also 
came here, to Dzerzhinskiy, yesterday. 
  "I hope that from their example I will gain a better feel 
for 
the defense sector's problems and understand what has to be 
done," the President stressed. 
  Boris Nikolayevich was asked the following question: In his 
opinion, how is the process of stabilization in the country 
progressing? 
  "All the signs are there that the economy is recovering," 
was 
his answer. "The first is that for five months now the 
inflation rate has been running at 8-9 percent, and yet it had 
been as high as 26 percent! Secondly, in June the rise in 
prices did not exceed 5.5 percent whereas in the past two years 
that indicator was never less than 10 percent. Finally, the 
slump in industrial production stopped in June. All these 
preconditions inspire the hope that the economy is getting back 
to an even keel. We believe that by the end of the year we will 
reach a civilized level of inflation -- 5-6 percent. 
  "The political situation in society is stabilizing," the 
president added. "The Treaty on [Social] Accord is working and 
life has become more peaceful. Support the Edict on the fight 
against crime!" 
  After a conference with the defense workers (held behind 
closed doors) B. Yeltsin paid a lightning visit to the 
Nikolo-Ugreshskiy monastery, which is next door to the Soyuz 
Science-and-Production Association.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Sugak] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- The Moscow government's 
decision "on the protection of the property rights of Moscow 
residents in view of the expiry of the validity of privatisation 
cheques" is in no way interpreted as an extension of the 
validity of the Russian voucher (cheque) on the territory of 
Moscow, Konstantin Buravlev, first vice-premier of Moscow, told 
the press centre of the mayor's office in comment on the 
decision. 
  Buravlev said the measure is aimed only at upholding the 
property rights of Muscovites who failed to put to use their 
privatisation cheques before July 1 for reasons that did not 
depend on them. 
  On July 10 the privatisation cheques issued in Moscow and 
not 
put to use during the cheque privatisation campaign are to be 
accepted by the Moscow savings bank branches for responsible 
custody. In exchange, the privatisation cheque holders will be 
given special certificates (registered receipts -- form 31). 
  Privatisation cheques, issued by the Moscow savings bank, 
are 
to be exchanged for F-31 receipts on presentation of a passport 
which should have a notation about residential registration in 
the capital at the date of issue of the privatisation cheque 
(one per bearer). 
  Underage children's privatisation cheques are to be accepted 
on presentation of the passport of one of the parents. The 
passport should have the name of the child entered in it. The 
exchange of unclaimed privatisation cheques for F-31 
certificates will continue until January 1, 1995. 
  Within a month, the Moscow authorities are to finalise and 
endorse a programme tentatively named Cheque-Moscow. After 
that, the Moscow government will offer the Muscovites the shares 
of Moscow-based enterprises and foundations and, probably, other 
securities backed up by Moscow property. 
  The Cheque-Moscow programme will be based on current laws 
with due regard for the overall economic situation in the 
country. Every holder of F-31 certificate will have several 
options to exercise his or her property rights. 
  The programme will be implemented so as not to infringe the 
property interests of Muscovites, who have already put their 
privatisation cheques to use, or the interests of investors in 
Moscow property.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Major General Aleksey Kozhevnikov, </F>
deputy commander in chief of the Russian Border Troops, by V. 
Kostomarov; place and date not given: "Border Across the 
Vyshtynetskoye Lake or Russia Is Ready To Compromise"] 
  [Text] As YANTARNIY KRAY has already reported, a working 
meeting of delegations of the Russian Border Troops and the 
Lithuanian Border Guard has been held. 
  "The negotiations were constructive, we resolved all issues 
included on the agenda." This is how the head of the Russian 
delegation, Major General Aleksey Kozhevnikov, deputy commander 
in chief of the Russian Border Troops and chairman of the 
Department for Holding International Negotiations within the 
Russian Border Troops, assessed the recent developments. 
  The priority directions in the continued cooperation have 
been detailed. This, in particular, includes exchanges of 
information, investigations in the interests of guarding the 
state border, the implementation of measures preventing the 
illegal transfer of weapons, drugs, and other goods banned for 
transborder shipments, and other illegal activities across the 
border and through border checkpoints, as well as the exchange 
of expertise in protecting borders and maintaining border 
control. 
  It was agreed that to draft an intergovernmental agreement 
on 
cooperation in border issues, the Lithuanian side will file a 
report on these negotiations with the Lithuanian Government. If 
this position is approved, appropriate working groups will be 
formed. They will probably meet in July-August of this year. 
  Anyone who attentively observes developments in relations 
between Moscow and Vilnius shares, of course, the viewpoint that 
one of the most complicated issues at the negotiations is the 
military traffic between Russia and Kaliningrad Oblast, which 
must cross Lithuanian territory. The protocol states that 
during the meeting the parties exchanged opinions on transiting 
goods across the territory of Lithuania to provide for the 
maintenance of the Kaliningrad Group of the Russian Border 
Troops. Major General Aleksey Kozhevnikov does not rule out 
that they will finally resolve this issue by singling it out 
from the entire block of military traffic issues. 
  One more thing. Participants in the meeting agreed that it 
is necessary to install a direct telephone (telex) line between 
the Kaliningrad Group of the Russian Border Troops and the 
Lithuanian Border Guard, between units and some checkpoints, as 
well as between certain border outposts and checkpoints. 
  I asked Major General Aleksey Kozhevnikov after the 
completion of the talks to answer some of my questions. 
  [Kostomarov] Aleksey Vladimirovich, you mentioned that you 
recently signed some border agreements with Poland. Will the 
agreements with Lithuania be of a similar nature? 
  [Kozhevnikov] They will differ due to some peculiarities in 
the conditions of the territory. Our border with Poland was 
established a long time ago, it is comprehensively equipped 
because for dozens of years it was guarded in cooperation with 
the Polish side. Our border with Lithuania is new, unequipped, 
and, in addition, has not yet been delineated. These days, 
according to the press, a special commission is dealing with the 
delineation issue. 
  [Kostomarov] Is it also addressing demarcation issues? 
  [Kozhevnikov] No, demarcation issues are still awaiting 
their 
resolution. A regular, seventh round of talks on delineation 
was held in Vilnius on 27-28 May. The parties agreed on the 
provisions of the planned agreement on state borders. There 
are, however, two moments which demand a rapprochement of 
positions. 
  [Kostomarov] What are they? 
  [Kozhevnikov] The first is the delineation of the economic 
zone and the maritime area. We should discuss the initial point 
from which we would proceed based on available international 
agreements. 
  The second is connected with Vyshtynetskoye Lake. Before, 
there was an administrative border -- currently, it is declared 
the state border -- which ran along the Lithuanian shore. We 
are ready to alter this configuration. In other words, the 
Russian side can compromise in the interests of our friendly 
relations with Lithuania. At the same time, we asked the 
Lithuanian side to allow our ships to travel along the Neman -- 
Lithuanian territory -- to the Baltic Sea. At the end of the 
talks, however, the position of Lithuania changed somewhat. I 
believe that the commissions of the two states will establish a 
point of contact.

<F P=106> [Text of the resolution by the Russian Government "On Urgent </F>
Measures To Stabilize Economic Situation of Kaliningrad Oblast"] 
  [Text] To implement edict No. 2117 "On Kaliningrad Oblast" 
of 7 December 1993 by the president of the Russian Federation, 
and considering a special geographic and economic situation of 
Kaliningrad Oblast, the Russian Government resolves as follows: 
  1. Beginning in 1994, based on proposals by the Kalinigrad 
Oblast administration, the Russian Finance Ministry should 
extend investment and tax credits to enterprises located in the 
oblast for implementing programs of socioeconomic development of 
Kaliningrad Oblast. 
  2. The Russian Ministries of Economy, Fuel and Power 
Engineering, and Foreign Trade should project the volume of oil 
to be extracted in Kaliningrad Oblast in 1994 which will be 
refined outside the customs territory of the Russian Federation, 
with due regard for feasibility reports by the Kalinigrad Oblast 
administration. 
  3. The Russian Ministries of Economy, Finance, and 
Agriculture should provide in 1994-95 centralized funds to 
agribusinesses of Kaliningrad Oblast covered by the federal 
special-purpose programs. 
  4. The administration of Kaliningrad Oblast should submit a 
long- term plan for developing the fishing industry to the 
Russian Ministry of Economy within a month. 
  The Russian Ministries of Economy and Finance and the 
Russian 
Federation Committee for Fishing Industry, along with the 
Kaliningrad Oblast administration, should examine the above 
program and submit to the Russian Government proposals regarding 
its financing beginning in 1994. 
  5. The Russian Fuel and Power Engineering Ministry and the 
Russian Energy and Electrification Joint Stock Company should: 
  -- undertake measures ensuring steady energy supplies to the 
economy of Kaliningrad Oblast and technical capabilities for 
sending an additional 10 megawatts of electricity; 
  -- when devising a feasibility plan for the construction of 
an electric line connecting Russia and the West, consider the 
possibility of connecting to it the "Yantarenergo" joint stock 
company. 
  6. The Kaliningrad Oblast administration, along with the 
Kaliningrad aviation enterprise, should come up with and 
approve, according to an established procedure, a feasibility 
report on the development of the Kaliningrad airport that will 
ultimately receive international status. 
  7. While drafting the state budget for 1994, the Russian 
Transportation Ministry should provide subsidies and subventions 
to Kaliningrad Oblast for building public roads. 
  8. The Kaliningrad Oblast administration, along with the 
Russian Transportation Ministry, the Federal Border Service, and 
the Chief Command of the Russian Border Troops, should consider 
the possibility for using the Gusev-Goldap-Suwalki-Grodno 
automobile motorway (running through Poland and Belarus and 
detouring Lithuania) as an alternative transit route and submit 
relevant proposals for examination by the Russian Government. 
  9. The Russian Ministries of Economy and Finance should 
examine the issue of extending to Kaliningrad Oblast investment 
credits to complete in 1994 the construction and modernization 
of building materials enterprises that were financed by the 
centralized sources. 
  10. The Kaliningrad Oblast administration and the Russian 
Environmental Protection Ministry, along with other interested 
federal executive bodies, should put together and submit within 
three month to the Russian Government a draft resolution on 
administering reserves and other territories under strict 
protection in Kaliningrad Oblast. 
  11. The Russian Environmental Protection Ministry and the 
Kaliningrad Oblast administration should take measures 
preventing the smuggling of toxic waste across Kaliningrad 
Oblast. 
  12. The Kaliningrad Oblast administration, a state customer 
that ordered the federal development program for Kaliningrad 
Oblast, in conjunction with the Russian Ministries of Economy 
and Finance and other relevant Russian executive bodies, should 
put together and submit to the Russian Government in the third 
quarter of 1994 a draft of the above program reflecting issues 
related to the development of power engineering, transportation, 
education, health care, culture, municipal services, 
environmental protection, etc.

  [Text] The Chechen republic has assessed the attempt by 
Russian helicopters to continue chasing terrorists above the 
territory of the republic as "an illegal violation of the air 
space of a sovereign state." The Chechen Foreign Ministry told 
Interfax that "only the Chechen republic's obligations to 
confront terrorism as an international phenomenon prevented it 
from taking tougher measures against the violators of the air 
space." 
  The Chechen State Security Department told Interfax that the 
Chechen anti-aircraft forces had forced the Russian helicopter 
following the helicopter with the terrorists on board land at 
Groznyy airport after they crossed the Chechen border. 
  "The detention and neutralization of the terrorists was 
carried out by Chechen special purpose units," a spokesman for 
the department said. 
  The terrorists had captured a bus with civilians near 
Mineralniye Vody and flew for Chechnya having been given a 
ransom of several million dollars. 
  At the moment, the terrorists, including two Chechen 
nationals and one Kumyk (one of the peoples populating Dagestan 
-- IF note) are in a custody in Groznyy under investigation. 
Negotiations are held to extradite the terrorists to Russia. 
  At the same time, a high-ranking official of the Chechen 
presidential staff told Interfax that Groznyy would insist on 
Russia's notifying it of emergencies. He described the fact 
that the Russian side had failed to take part in the detention 
of the terrorists near the Chechen town of Gudermes as a blunder 
by the Russian special services.

<F P=106> [Report by Petr Kirillov under the "Postscript: Events and </F>
Commentaries" rubric: "37 to 1 -- Alas, Not in Favor of 
Settling the Conflict"] 
  [Text] Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of the Russian 
Federal Assembly Federation Council, held a news conference 28 
June on problems of settling the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. 
  He described as grave the situation which has taken shape 
there, "although a degree of stabilization is taking place out 
of the laws of evolution, with no special interference, and 
maybe even despite interference by federal and local organs of 
power. People are tired and are themselves seeking peace." 
  Abdulatipov pointed out that in the past, in fulfillment of 
the president's edict of 13 December 1993, which clearly 
designated ways out of the crisis, the Russian Government 
adopted a corresponding decree. Of its 37 points, to date 
just...one has been fulfilled. Although the deadline was set 
for March-April of this year. The matter is being held up 
either at the Ministry of Economics or at the Ministry of 
Finance. Whether they want it or not, Abdulatipov declared, 
their sluggishness could lead to new clashes. 
  For example, the planned capital investments in Ingushetia 
amount to 91 billion rubles [R]. To date, however, Ingushetia 
has received only R800 million -- just 0.8 percent of the set 
amount. In Ingushetia 0.8 percent has been spent on housing 
construction, and 6 percent on other sectors. The construction 
workers who have rebuilt houses for refugees in North Ossetia 
have not even received their wages. The most interesting thing, 
Abdulatipov pointed out, is that money is being allocated in 
accordance with all the documents. But very insignificant 
amounts reach the addressees. 
  What question can there be of resettling refugees if houses 
are not being rebuilt? At the same time dozens of construction 
companies are looking for work in the North Caucasus. There are 
approximately 110,000 unemployed people in the region. There is 
a construction infrastructure. There is no money. 
  Unless decisive measures are taken, the state of emergency 
zone in the region of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict will become a 
paradise for political adventurers and criminals.

<F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Gypylov: "We Shall Grow Through Siberia </F>
if We Raise It Up, `Siberian Accord' Members Believe"] 
  [Text] Irkutsk -- Saturday and Sunday were working days on 
Lake Baykal for the members of the "Siberian Accord" regional 
association. The leaders of 19 components of the Russian 
Federation -- from the Urals to the Transbaykal -- met at the 
lake to coordinate the activity of republics, krays, and oblasts 
on socioeconomic problems. State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, 
Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, and Federal Assembly upper chamber 
chairman Vladimir Shumeyko took part in the latest session. 
  The principles of regional policy, charges for electricity 
and rail transport, measures to overcome adverse phenomena on 
the labor market were the range of questions discussed. Without 
going into details I shall note the main thing: The Siberians 
have a reasoned and persistent desire to play a leading role in 
the country's state development. No one likes the role of 
pawns. Their only "diversion and delusion of youth" was that a 
year ago they spoke of their own Siberian republic. 
  And until the October rebellion everyone repeated that 
Russia 
would be saved by the regions. Irkutsk Governor Yuriy Nozhikov 
believes that "these phrases were current while the authorities 
sought allies in the provinces but when they no longer needed 
allies they could not see the role of the regions...." "But now 
they have developed a unified position so that the attitude 
toward the regions is not seen as the attitude of the 
metropolitan state toward a colony?" the reporters asked the 
"fathers" from "Siberian accord." The latter replied "perhaps," 
"it must be supposed...." Now there are real constitutional 
powers but.... They cannot sense any unity. The components are 
waging a quiet but very noticeable permanent struggle. Both 
among themselves and with Moscow. 
  Perhaps this does not apply only to Irkutsk Oblast and 
Krasnoyarsk Kray. They have much in common in their economies 
and raw material resources and they are linked by the same 
Angara-Yenisey waterway.... Of course, they also defend their 
own interests -- and win. Here they recalled how some time ago 
by an edict of the president instructed that the local very 
powerful hydroelectric power stations -- the Bratsk, Ust-Ilimsk, 
Ust-Khantayskaya, Kureyskaya, and others -- be transferred to 
the ownership of the "Unified Power Grid of Russia" Russian 
state joint-stock company which has been created. Their 
turbines generate an enormous quantity of energy, which is the 
cheapest in the country. This is the most profitable item of 
the local budget. If a joint-stock company were formed they 
would have to buy their own electricity, but at high prices. 
That is why there was powerful resistance from the regions. It 
was settled by the Constitutional Court in favor of the two 
components. The victory on this principled dispute was a lesson 
to others. We must talk with the regions in a civilized 
language, observing mutual interests. 
  The Baykal meeting showed that the activity of the "Siberian 
Accord" is nonetheless characterized by a further attraction 
toward the integration of the regions and toward the improvement 
of people's economic standard and consequently their living 
standard. Incidentally, it was noted that life expectancy here 
is five to 10 years less than in the central part of the country 
and that Siberian health today is a myth. 
  In elaborating the new concept of economic collaboration all 
factors of the reform were considered. They are reflected in 
the documents which were adopted. A new regional ideology is 
taking shape, albeit slowly -- the further decentralization of 
power and, as they said here, their "decolonization." 
  Indeed, Russia will grow through Siberia if Siberia itself 
acquires the right it needs to independent economic initiative. 
  All participants in the meeting liked the great lake, its 
deep water, and wide, free expanses. The guests tasted the 
famous Baykal fish, the omul. And their courteous hosts -- the 
leaders of the Irkutsk and Chita Oblast administrations and the 
Buryatia Government -- reminded the country's eminent officials 
that the "law on Baykal" has been languishing in their files for 
a long time now. Two years ago they prepared this document but 
were unable to achieve its adoption in the former parliament, 
and the State Duma is still only studying the draft.

  [Text] The accident which occurred with solid radioactive 
waste products being stored on the Pacific Fleet in Kamchatka 
was brought under control, the Russian Ministry for Emergency 
Situations (RMES) told INTERFAX. 
  On June 26 two plates encasing a store of solid radioactive 
waste sagged as a result of a flash flood. The RMES said that 
after experts examined the background radiation it was exceeding 
the acceptable level at only two sites. 
  Before the concrete cover could be restored, the site of the 
accident was covered with lead sheets in order to minimize 
possible leakage of radiation. The RMES said that the sagged 
encasing plates had been changed on June 29. The radiation 
background had been normal at that time. 
  The department for control over radiation security of 
military and defense facilities under the State Atomic Control 
Committee (Gosatomnadzor) told INTERFAX that the department had 
practically no ability to control nuclear facilities under the 
Defense Ministry as the Defense Ministry was not observing the 
provision on interdepartmental state control. 
  According to nonofficial information, a high-ranking 
official 
from Gosatomnadzor said that no people had been affected and 
that the environment had not been polluted during the accident. 
  The same sources said that solid waste of low radioactivity 
was kept in the storage facility namely special uniforms, spare 
parts and equipment affected by radiation. 
  This store has received no waste since 1975 and during this 
period of time all fast-decaying isotopes had dissociated, the 
official said. He stressed that there would never be any 
catastrophe with this store of waste.

  [Text] Borys Tarasyuk, head of Ukraine's National 
Disarmament Committee and deputy foreign affairs minister, 
delivered a speech at a plenary CSCE session in Vienna today. 
In particular, he informed the session participants about the 
measures taken by the leadership of Ukraine in the field of 
nuclear disarmament and armaments control. Relevant decisions 
by the Supreme Council, the president, and the government 
convincingly testify to Ukraine's responsible attitude toward 
issues of the nonproliferation of mass annihilation weapons, and 
Ukraine's readiness to establish equal partnership relations 
with all countries to ensure universal peace and stability. 
  Touching on the nuclear weapons nonproliferation issue, the 
Ukrainian representative told the participants in the forum that 
a relevant agreement on the implementation of the IAEA 
guarantees in relation to the nuclear materials used for 
peaceful nuclear activities in Ukraine was coordinated with that 
agency recently. 
  In his speech Borys Tarasyuk paid special attention to the 
prospects of Ukraine's participation in multilateral 
undertakings to control the export of sensitive goods and 
technologies. In particular, he criticized the stand of the 
former Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export 
Controls] member states, which does not take into account 
Ukraine's proposal on its participation in the process of 
creating a new international regime of export control.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Difficult Work Is Ahead of Us"] </F>
  [Text] A session of the UN Economic and Social Council 
opened in New York yesterday. In terms of significance, it 
occupies third place in the structure of the United Nations 
after the General Assembly and the Security Council. Ukraine is 
a member of the UN Economic and Social Council and participates 
in all its sessions. 
  "This time, our delegation must raise, first and foremost, 
the questions of social and economic development of the 
Ukrainian state, the course of reforms, and the assistance to 
these processes on the part of the United Nations," said First 
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mykola Makarevych. "Besides, 
we must also draw the attention of the world community to two 
problems that are important and painful for us -- the presently 
effective UN sanctions against the former Yugoslavia and the 
size of Ukraine's monetary contribution to the United Nations. 
We will again insist that it is primarily the civilian 
population that suffers from the sanctions. That is why we 
attach great importance to either canceling the sanctions or 
minimizing them. Regarding contributions, very complicated work 
is envisioned. We are not only indebted to the United Nations, 
but also to other international organizations. Even though the 
percentage is, in fact, exceedingly high for Ukraine, the money 
must be paid. In this direction, we will continue to elaborate 
a mechanism enabling us to correctly calculate the size of our 
contributions and submit the relevant information to the United 
Nations."

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Chikalin: "The Telephone of </F>
Confidence Will Soon Connect Ministers of Ukraine and the United 
States"] 
  [Text] So far, the hot-line telephone has been installed 
in the office of U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry. 
Specialists from the United States are expected in Kiev soon to 
establish a direct connection between our defense minister and 
his U.S. colleague. During an official visit to the United 
States by a delegation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Ukrainian 
Army General [and Defense Minister] Vitaliy Radetskyy spent 
three days in the company of William Perry. The atmosphere of 
confidence can be confirmed by the following fact: Our minister 
observed the dismantlement of a strategic missile launcher. ( By 
the way, he also had an opportunity to touch the tumbler that 
destroyed it.) He showed us the device used to do that, which 
he kept as a souvenir. He also told us that the explosion at the 
silo was observed by a farmer and his family, on whose land the 
launcher had been located. His wife held their two-month-old 
son, who did not even wake up from the sound of the explosion. 
This fact confirms the security of works connected with the 
dismantling of silos, and those that are still in operation, 
which had previously been aimed at Ukraine but were retargeted 
on 30 May. We did the same thing as early as December of 1993. 
  Most likely, relations of confidence, which have been 
established between the chiefs of military departments, will 
soon be expanded to include officers and soldiers. 
  An agreement on training Ukrainian officers at U.S. military 
education centers has been reached. Meanwhile, our soldiers are 
preparing for joint military exercise with Polish and Dutch 
servicemen. Similar exercises with U.S. Army units have been 
scheduled for 1995. 
  According to Vitaliy Radetskyy, there are plenty of things 
to 
be implemented, based on the experience of our U.S. colleagues. 
In particular, this relates to the organization of education 
centers and use of simulators. An agreement has already been 
signed, which envisions that 12 Ukrainian officers will be sent 
to military centers to study the U.S. experience firsthand. At 
the same time, however, we cannot copy everything; which must 
take into account our own capabilities and conditions, which are 
quite unique. For example, let us look at living standards. 
The Army driver who was driving Vitaliy Radetskyy during his 
visit to the United States, is a contract serviceman. He 
receives $1,600 [per month], has his own apartment and car, as 
does his wife. Our country, however, currently does not have 
funds to introduce a contract service that would meet 
servicemen's demands. Therefore, the mixed system of staffing 
the Army is being preserved. As of today, 72.3 percent of young 
reinforcements have been drafted, and 35,000 people are already 
serving on contracts. Nevertheless, in general, these 
conditions do not satisfy people. This relates, in particular, 
to wages. A lieutenant receives so little money that he is not 
able to invite his girlfriend to a cafe. Therefore, the defense 
minister has recently addressed the issue of increasing 
financial provisions for servicemen to the president and the 
Supreme Council.

  [Text] On 29 June Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
received Lionel Soto, vice president of the Council of Ministers 
of the Republic of Cuba, who paid an official visit to our 
country as head of a Cuban governmental delegation. There was a 
conversation during which various aspects of Ukrainian-Cuban 
cooperation were touched upon. 
  We highly assess the all-round development of such relations 
and strive for their successful development in this direction, 
Leonid Kravchuk said. Our people, he stressed, have always 
respected the Cuban people. 
  In the conversation they discussed a number of long-term 
trends in Ukrainian-Cuban cooperation. 
  After the meeting Lionel Soto replied to a number of 
questions from journalists. Dwelling on his conversation with 
the president he referred to it as very important. We had an 
opportunity to exchange opinions with the president on restoring 
relations between the two countries and their further 
development, already in new conditions, when Ukraine acts as an 
independent state. For a certain period of time these relations 
were weakened, however at present prospects have become 
available for restoring and deepening these relations.

long been a need for this document, Lionel Soto said. I am

relations. As of today we can carry on trade right across the 
sea, because Cuba is an island state and this is the only way to 
communicate with the outside world.

  [Text] The leader of a Cuban governmental delegation, Vice 
President of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cuba 
Lionel Soto, referred to his delegation's visit to Ukraine as 
very important. 
  At a news conference in Kiev, Lionel Soto pointed out that 
the main objective of the visit was to restore all the economic 
relations which Ukraine and Cuba maintained during the Soviet 
Union's existence. After the disintegration of the USSR, he 
pointed out, these relations have been almost abolished. 
  The head of the Cuban governmental delegation also declared 
that there are no political differences between our two states 
and that our peoples are friendly peoples. 
  At present, Lionel Soto said, we must get down to specific 
work on developing our relations.

Supreme Council, received Michel-Yves Peissik, French ambassador 
to Ukraine. Issues related to the development of 
Ukrainian-French relations were discussed during the 
conversation. Much attention was paid to ways of encouraging 
French investment in Ukraine's economy. Whoever is the first to 
do this will gain a higher profit, Moroz stressed. 
  Among the major topics discussed was the issue of 
eliminating 
the consequences of the Chernobyl accident. Chernobyl is a 
misfortune not only for the Ukrainian people. The world 
community should understand that this is a matter of concern for 
all. It is necessary to resolutely move from declarations to 
concrete assistance, Moroz declared. 
  Peissik said that a representative of France's prime 
minister 
is expected to arrive in Ukraine in early July. This visit will 
be entirely dedicated to the Chernobyl issue. During the talks 
they also discussed ways of expanding Ukrainian-French 
interparliamentary relations.

  [Text] Simferopol -- On 29 June the first session of the 
Supreme Council of Crimea continued its work. Issues on the 
program for economic reform in the autonomous republic, on the 
structure of the government, and on target subsidies to people 
with low incomes in connection with the expected rise in prices 
for bread were put on the agenda. 
  The deputies approved a resolution on raising the excise 
duties for wines, hard liquors, and beer produced in the 
republic. The resolution will come into force as of 1 July. By 
the way, its text coincides with a similar decree by the 
president of Crimea which was signed and validated on 24 June. 
  The deputies postponed the issue on target subsidies so as 
to 
discuss it in the presence of Yuriy Meshkov. 
  The deputies decided to consider the situation which took 
shape in the militia bodies after the approval by the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine of amendments and additions to the law of 
Ukraine "On militia" and "On the delimitation of powers between 
the bodies of state authority of Ukraine and the Republic of 
Crimea" on 28 June. In the opinion of Serhiy Tsekov, chairman of 
the Supreme Council of Crimea, the Ukrainian parliament 
"infringed upon the laws on the status of the Republic of Crimea 
and on the delimitation of powers." 
  A deputy commission headed by deputy chairman of the Supreme 
Council of Crimea Oleksiy Melnykov was set up to consider this 
issue. On the same day the commission got down to work and met 
the members of the collegium of the chief Directorate of 
Internal Affairs in Crimea under the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs of Ukraine. As Oleksiy Melnykov told the deputies, only 
three members of the collegium agreed to work at the Chief 
Directorate of Internal Affairs of Crimea. There were proposals 
on the part of the deputies to lift a moratorium on holding the 
Crimean referendum and terminate negotiations with the 
delegation of the Ukrainian parliament. 
  The commission was charged with drafting a resolution on the 
situation which took shape. The debate on the issue will be 
continued at a regular plenary sitting on 30 June.

  He said at a news conference in Kiev that quite a few people 
had voted for him even though he had no access to speak of to 
state-owned mass media. IF Note: According to the Central 
Election Commission [CEC], in the first round 9,944,474 people, 
or 37.72 percent, voted for Leonid Kravchuk and 8,244,844 (31,27 
pct) for Leonid Kuchma. They are followed by Aleksandr Moroz 
(3,437,816, or 13.04 pct), Vladimir Lanovoy (2,455,830, or 9.32 
pct), Valeriy Babich (630,392, or 2.39 pct), Ivan Plyushch 
(341,173, or 1.29 pct) and Petr Talanchuk (142,996, or 0.54 
pct). The CEC Chairman Ivan Yemets officially announced Tuesday 
that runoff elections would be held in which the voters would 
have a choice between Kravchuk and Kuchma. The exact date will 
be announced on 30 June. It is expected to be 10 July. 
  Kuchma thought that the large support given him, Moroz and 
Lanovoy showed that the people wanted change. 
  He advocated evolutionary reform of the economy and 
expressed 
his willingness to cooperate with leading economists, in 
particular Vladimir Lanovoy and Viktor Pinzenik. 
  He confirmed his view that the CIS had to be a common 
economic space and emphasized, however, that he objected to 
Ukraine's entry of the ruble zone and to a military alliance in 
the CIS framework. He made it clear that he wanted only an 
economic union. 
  Kuchma said that he had found during his election campaign 
there was no problem of Crimea but Crimea did not trust the Kiev 
authorities. 
  He said that if he is elected he would do his best to work 
constructively with parliament and never engage in a tug-of-war 
for power. 
  In a protest he filed with the Central Election Commission 
and the Supreme Soviet Presidium Kuchma said that the 
state-owned mass media had promoted only the case of Leonid 
Kravchuk in the whole month of June 1994. 
  In particular, even on the election day they urged people to 
vote for him. This was a flagrant violation of electoral 
legislation. 
  The supporters of parliament Chairman Aleksandr Moroz will 
vote for Kuchma in the second round of elections and those who 
voted for Vasiliy Lanovoy in the first round, for Kravchuk, said 
Viktor Pinzenik, chairman of the Reform Support Fund. He told 
INTERFAX that numerous voters would not report to the polling 
stations at all in the second round. 
  For his part, parliamentary Legislation and Court and Legal 
System Reform Committee Chairman Sergey Sobolev thought that the 
supporters of both Moroz and Lanovoy would vote for Kravchuk 
while Vladimir Grinyov, co-chairman of the Inter-Regional Reform 
Bloc, believed that every fourth supporter of Lanovoy and three 
out of every four supporters of Moroz would vote for Kuchma. He 
assumed that in the second round the turnout would be much lower. 
  Anton Buteyko, head of the president's foreign policy 
service, thought that the citizens who had voted for Moroz and 
Lanovoy in the first round would vote for the man who had been 
president. 
  Sergey Dovgan, chairman of the Peasants Party, thought that 
100 percent of Moroz's supporters would vote for Kuchma while 
Lanovoy's electorate would split down the middle. IF Note: The 
runoff election will be won by the candidate who wins more than 
his rival provided that more votes are cast for than against 
him. In the first round of presidential elections the 
difference between Kravchuk and Kuchma was 6.5 percent.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 29 June TASS -- "The progress of elections 
forces me to make the conclusion that the Central Election 
Committee, the state-run broadcasting and other mass media, 
especially the parliamentary newspaper GOLOS UKRAINY, blatantly 
disregard the law on presidential elections, as well as 
parliament's resolution guaranteeing equal opportunities for 
electioneering and campaigning", presidential nominee Leonid 
Kuchma said on Wednesday [29 June] in an address to Ukraine's 
parliament. 
  According to former Prime Minister Kuchma, "for the past 
month, Ukraine's national television has been virtually 
transformed into daily air time of one presidential nominee -- 
Leonid Kravchuk." The ex-premier is particularly concerned over 
the fact that "the Central Election Committee pretends not to 
notice these irregularities and ignores gross violations of the 
election procedure reported by some foreign observers." 
  With this in view, Kuchma urged the parliament presidium "to 
consider the issue of disregarding the election law by the State 
TV and Radio Company and other central mass media, as well as 
the political stand taken by the Central Election Committee." 
  The former prime minister also lodged a protest with the 
Central Election Committee, demanding that resolute measures be 
immediately taken to implement the law on presidential 
elections, which provides for equal opportunities for candidates 
to carry out election campaign.

<F P=106> ["Our correspondent" report: "Crimeans Have Made Their </F>
Choice"] 
  [Text] Some 1,103 polling stations opened last Sunday at 
0700 hours Moscow time (an hour earlier than throughout Ukraine) 
in cities and districts of Crimea. The elections of a president 
of Ukraine had begun. This is the third election campaign on the 
peninsula since the start of the present year. And if it is 
considered that in the first two the elections were held in two 
stages, 26 June was the fifth time that Crimeans had gone to the 
polls. 
  The campaign for the election of the president of Ukraine 
crept up somehow imperceptibly, without the usual ballyhoo and 
scope. Only in the final week before the elections did all seven 
Ukrainian presidential candidates take part in a televised 
debate, speak on radio, and tour the regions, the Republic of 
Crimea included. The candidates for the position of head of 
state endeavored to win votes by personal contact with the 
electorate and presentation of their programs. 
  And this was not an easy choice for the latter. Which of the 
seven to choose? After all, what our lives will be like in the 
future will depend on who is elected. We cannot, therefore, make 
a mistake and approach the polls indifferently, as just another 
campaign of which we are sick and tired. This is a critical and 
decisive choice, particularly for Crimea, with its difficult 
relations with Ukraine. 
  The fears that the summer vacations and the height of the 
summer season would influence the activity of the election were 
unfounded. Those who had left Crimea were able to perform their 
civic duty as of 11 June. Students who had passed their 
examinations and lecturers who had gone on leave availed 
themselves of this right at Polling Station 1/253 of the 
republic center's Zheleznodorozhnyy Rayon, which is located at 
the Medical Institute. Polling Station 1/350 of Tsentralnyy 
Rayon was crowded from the first hour that it was open. Fifty 
percent of those on the electoral roll had voted here by 1400 
hours. 
  According to preliminary information, 52 percent of the 
electorate had participated in the elections in the republic as 
of 1600 hours. The greatest activity was displayed by the 
electorate of Nizhnegorskiy (57.2 percent), Razdolnenskiy 
(63.3), Krasnoperekopskiy (57.2), Belogorskiy (55.9), and 
Krasnogvardeyskiy (53.2) Rayons and Sudak (54.6), Kerch (53.6), 
and Bakhchisaray (58.8 percent). 
  According to the data of the district election commission of 
Crimean Election District No 1, some 1,003,785 persons 
participated in the ballot for the election of the president of 
Ukraine, and 999,376 persons actually voted, which constituted 
62.7 percent. 
  The vote was distributed as follows: 
  Valeriy Georgiyevich Babich--19,272 "for," 971,718 
"against" (1.9 percent); 
  Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk--74,243 "for," 916,747 
"against" (7.4 percent); 
  Leonid Danilovych Kuchma--825,250 "for," 165,740 
"against" (82.6 percent); 
  Volodymyr Timofeyevych Lanovyy--33,623 "for," 
957,367 "against" (3.4 percent); 
  Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz--12,640 "for," 
978,367 "against" (1.3 percent); 
  Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch--2,975 "for," 988,015 
"against" (0.3 percent); 
  Petro Mykhaylovych Talanchuk--2,224 "for," 988,766 
"against" (0.2 percent). 
  Repeat elections were held on 26 June in four election 
districts in which deputies of the parliament of Crimea had not 
been elected on 27 March: Chapayevskiy No. 6 of Yevpatoriya, 
Livadiyskiy No. 29 of Yalta, and Sevastopolskiy No. 63 and No. 
64. 
  According to data of the Central Election Commission for 
Elections of the Supreme Council of Crimea, the elections were 
valid, but a runoff for the election of the deputies were 
scheduled for all the districts for 10 July.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 28 Jun -- Interviewed by the KRYMSKIYE 
IZVESTIYA [CRIMEAN NEWS] newspaper, Serhiy Nikulin, leader of 
the Russia grouping at the Supreme Council of Crimea and 
chairman of its nation-building, legislation, legality, law and 
order standing committee, accused Yuriy Meshkov and Yevhen 
Saburov, the autonomy's president and deputy prime minister 
respectively, of "attempts to gain absolute power" in Crimea and 
"place themselves outside any control by parliament, as happened 
in Russia after the shooting at the Supreme Soviet." 
  Serhiy Nikulin says this began with "the Crimean 
presidential 
administration and government moving away from the political 
forces that ensured Yuriy Meshkov's victory in the presidential 
election." He doubts whether the president intends to carry out 
his pre-election program. 
  The Russia bloc, Serhiy Nikulin underlines, "opposes this 
Crimean government's unlimited power only in order to be able on 
behalf of the people to supervise its actions."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ukrainian Political Figures Answer </F>
the Question by the Information Service VYBIR: `What Is Your 
Opinion of [Prime Minister] Masol?'"] 
  [Text] Les Tanyuk, member of the Rukh 
[Ukraine's People's Movement for Perestroyka] faction in the 
parliament: "The choice of Masol is logical -- once Socialists 
head the parliament, they must have a socialist prime minister." 
  Volodymyr Pylypchuk, member of the "Center" 
faction: "After hearing his program, I must say that Masol has 
changed. His program coincides with mine by 90 percent. Masol 
has seriously changed -- he engaged in business for four years. 
It is not bad that the left-wing forces have won. In the past, 
they came out as an active separatist force, and now they have 
got this state and must take care of it. Perhaps, today, they 
are the only ones capable of keeping it united." 
  Serhiy Holovatyy, member of the faction "Reforms": 
"There is one positive aspect to Masol's election -- this is 
the first case when the prime minister was elected by the 
parliamentary majority alone." 
  Oleksandr Yemets, member of the presidium of the 
Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine: "With the beginning of 
the formation of a procommunist government and victory of 
communist forces in parliamentary elections, the `left-wing' 
forces must form a government of like-minded people, since it is 
impossible today to form a coalition government." 
  Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, Ukraine's people's deputy: 
"Masol is a good specialist and an industrialist. The 
government's policy will be maintained as long as he is in 
power. We had many meetings when I was the acting prime 
minister, and we could agree on the majority of issues." 
  Vyacheslav Kyrylenko, leader of MoNR [expansion 
unknown] and former chairman of the USS [expansion unknown]: "A 
power which advances past leaders to the political proscenium, 
shows that it has no future."

  [Text] Donetsk Oblast [no date as received] -- As UNIAN 
reported, miners at the "Ordzhonikidzevuhillya" coal production 
association and the "Yenakiyevo" and "Poltava" pits went on 
strike in Yenakiyevo on 27 June, demanding payment of wage 
arrears. The strike continued at these mines on 28 June. Some 
of the miners at the Karl Marx, "Chernovonyy Zhovten," 
"Chervonyy Profinter," and "Yunkom" pits joined the strike. A 
total of 1,200 of the association's 2,248 workers are on strike. 
A rally consisting of 350 miners was held on 28 June near the 
town council building where demands were made to pay the wages 
and dismiss the director general of the "Ordzhonikidzevuhillya" 
production association. 
  A strike committee consisting of 12 persons was elected (one 
of the members is a former Komsomol leader and former USSR 
people's deputy Viktor Honcharov) and it was decided to continue 
the strike until the demands that had been raised have been 
completely fulfilled. 
  On 28 June, 118 of 258 workers on the second shift at the 
"PivdennoDonbass" mine of the "Donetskvuhillya" production 
association in the town of Ugledar refused to start work for the 
same reasons -- delay in paying wages. After a meeting with the 
mine's director, who promised to pay the arrears, the miners on 
the third shift returned to work. 
  On 27 June, all miners on the fourth shift at the "Karbomid" 
and "Pervomaysk" mines in Pervomaysk, Lugansk oblast, refused to 
start work (142 and 157 miners respectively). 
  In the opinion of the mine's representatives, who wished not 
to be identified, the strike has a clear political hue -- to 
attempt to compromise the existing authorities and, 
particularly, President Leonid Kravchuk before the second round 
of presidential elections. According to some reports, among the 
leaders of the striking pits there are members of the 
Kuchma-Hrynyov Interregional Bloc of Reforms. 
  As Kostyantyn Fesenko, chairman of the coal industry workers 
trade union, informed a UNIAN correspondent, Viktor Yushchenko, 
the chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, in a telephone 
conversation on 29 June, gave assurances that the money for the 
miners' wages as well as subsidies for the following month would 
be found and forwarded in the next few days.

<F P=106> [Report by HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent Mykola Horvat from </F>
Transcarpathian Oblast: "It Depends Upon the Authorities What 
Kind of Free Economic Zone We Will Have"] 
  [Text] In the course of the election campaign in 
Transcarpathia, the question of the attitude on the part of the 
contestants to the idea of introducing a Free Economic Zone in 
the region has become a major one. 
  Together with their supporters, the present candidates for 
"governors" and local "parliaments" may be divided into three 
camps. 
  The first of these, which includes present leaders of the 
oblast and of numerous industrial enterprises and farms, and 
also individual scientists and representatives of a number of 
influential public and national-cultural societies, supports the 
idea of creating in the region a Free Economic Zone 
"Europe-Center" (precisely under this name a package of 
documents was submitted for the consideration of the Cabinet of 
Ministers and the Supreme Council). The main author of the 
bill, Ukraine's people's deputy Serhiy Ustych, who masterminded 
and inspired the project and is the leader of the group, is also 
one of the real claimants to the post of chairman of the oblast 
council. He is also supported by a considerable number of the 
more than 200 registered candidates for 60 seats in the 
"parliament" of the region. The most significant of their 
arguments is, first and foremost, the advantageous economic and 
geographical situation of Transcarpathia (it borders upon four 
post-socialist states), which may serve for Ukraine as a kind of 
bridge between the countries of eastern, central, and western 
Europe, as an experimental proving ground for the development of 
civilized entrepreneurship, for the attraction of foreign 
investments for technical and technological re-equipment of 
production, and may promote our country's integration into 
various economic, financial, and other structures of the world. 
  The second camp, which unites, first and foremost, 
representatives of local cells of Rukh [Ukraine's People's 
Movement for Perestroyka], Ukraine's Democratic Party, Ukraine's 
Republican Party, Ukrainian Nationalist Assembly, and a number 
of other organizations of national democratic denomination that 
are adamantly against the Free Economic Zone project in its 
present form. In their opinion, the introduction of a Free 
Economic Zone may lead to Transcarpathia's secession from 
Ukraine and to a situation where the region will be plundered by 
Western investors. They also fear that it will enable those 
officials who govern the region, to make a fortune at the 
expense of others. 
  This is the position adhered to by former people's deputy of 
Ukraine and presently candidate for "governor" Viktor Bed. On 
the whole, he does not reject the idea of a Free Economic Zone 
and comes out decisively in favor of free entrepreneurship and 
various economic experiments. However, he believes that the 
introduction of the zone is premature as long as questions of 
ownership, civilized privatization, or land reform in the region 
remain unresolved. Nor does he agree with the present project 
of the system of management of the Free Economic Zone, when 
members of the so-called Oversight Council or General 
Directorate are not elected nationwide. 
  Yet another claimant to the seat of chairman of the Oblast 
Council and former first secretary of the [Communist] Party 
Oblast Committee Professor Vasyl Khymynets is also opposed to 
the present variant of the bill on a Free Economic Zone in 
Transcarpathia. In his election campaign, he exclusively 
promotes legitimization of the results of the oblast referendum 
held on 1 December 1991 on granting the region the status of a 
special self-governed administrative territory, which is not the 
same as a Free Economic Zone (even though some politicians try 
to equate these entirely dissimilar notions). 
  One more candidate -- the present presidential 
representative 
in Uzhhorod Rayon, Ukraine's people's deputy Mykhaylo Dancha, if 
elected "governor," will seek legislative confirmation of the 
special economic rights of self-government. 
  Finally, the third "team" includes those who, in principle, 
also support the idea of a Free Economic Zone in Transcarpathia. 
However, not on the scale of the entire oblast, but, to begin 
with, in individual towns or districts. Present mayor of 
Uzhhorod Emil Landovskyy is a proponent of such a stand. He has 
also actively joined the struggle for the highest post in the 
region. He and his supporters believe that such an approach is 
the least risky and, if it fails, the losses from the experiment 
will be minimal. When it proves its viability by concrete 
results, it may be introduced throughout the territory of the 
oblast. 
  As is known, the "old" composition of the Supreme Council 
"killed" the initial bill on the Free Economic Zone in 
Transcarpathia. Although, in the opinion of many, at that time 
political ambitions prevailed over sound economic common sense. 
The working group analyzed the constructive criticism and 
proposals voiced at the Supreme Council session, amended the 
project and sent it to the Cabinet of Ministers and the Supreme 
Council for further consideration. 
  Incidentally, the package of documents has already been 
approved by a number of authoritative international institutions 
and experts, by the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, an organization for industrial development -- a key 
structure of the United Nations, which is also ready to take an 
active part in attracting investments for implementing major 
programs. 
  Thus, by voting for a supporter of a particular trend in the 
development of Transcarpathia, the voters will determine the 
future of the region.

  [Excerpt] Kiev [no date as received] -- Five 
representatives of the World Bank's preparatory mission who were 
working here 6-27 June held their concluding meeting today at 
Ukraine's Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs. From the 
Ukrainian side, the following took part in the meeting: Yuriy 
Karasyk, Ukraine's minister of agriculture and foodstuffs; Borys 
Kyrychenko, chairman of the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Foodstuffs' directorate for foreign economic ties; and Mykola 
Shkarban, chairman of the Association of Ukrainian Farmers. 
  The experts from the World Bank submitted for consideration 
a 
memorandum of a project for the restructuring of Ukraine's 
agriculture. It defines the structure of a possible guarantee 
fund for the preliminary financing of agricultural export, 
develops the structure for the supply of resources for 
agricultural production, and proposes assistance in creating 
land registry schemes, etc. According to the project, the 
granting of technical assistance will begin in September or 
October. 
  As Mykola Shkarban, chairman of the Association of Ukrainian 
Farmers, informed a UNIAN correspondent, the World Bank is 
allocating $20-30 million for the restructuring of Ukraine's 
agriculture, of which $10 million is for an appraisal of the 
country's land resources. However, in total the World Bank 
could, as part of this project, allocate $1.2 billion but this 
amount will be allocated only on condition that the Ukrainian 
Government fulfills the following demands: controls emission, 
reduces the budget deficit to a minimum, and lifts restrictions 
on exports and creates a single system of hard currency 
conversion. However, in Mykola Shkarban's words: "Ukraine is 
not fulfilling these conditions and is not likely to do so in 
the near future and that is why we will receive only the 
projected $20-30 million from the World Bank. In addition, the 
shortage of private regional companies engaged in supplying 
means for agricultural production (they make up 15 percent of 
the total while the remainder is carried out by the 
Ukrahrotekhservis and Ukrahrokhim concerns) significantly 
hinders the expansion of investment in Ukraine. The amount 
invested, therefore, depends on expanding the network of such 
private dealers. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Semenov by correspondent O. Sigacheva; </F>
place and date not given: "...Is Not Moscow on Our Side? The 
Sevastopol-Russia Common Economic Space Is Already Taking Shape"] 
  [Text] At the time of Moscow's May Day anniversary 
festivities Moscow City Hall allocated for the social needs of 
Sevastopol a tidy sum--R500 million. This was the result of a 
trip to the Russian capital by V. Semenov, chairman of the city 
council. The polemic over this fact continues. Some people 
consider the Russian money a gift (handout) for the Ukrainian 
city, others, an important event in the history of Sevastopol 
and the start of the real integration of the capital of the 
Russian fleet in Russia. 
  [Sigacheva] Viktor Mikhaylovich, who is right? And how, 
generally, did this idea arise? 
  [Semenov] Life itself dictates the need to create a common 
union of Slav states since the latter-day sovereign borders run 
primarily through the fate of ordinary people. I began to think 
that the prototype of a future common economic space and the 
first component of revival could be a union of hero-cities for 
they are located only in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The idea 
of a union of hero-cities arose at public organization level 
last year, and an executive committee of the union headed by 
Admiral A. Kalinin, former commander of the Black Sea Fleet, was 
created. But I wanted to expand the framework of 
military-patriotic education and to raise the concord to a 
higher, practical level. My proposal concerning the organization 
of economic ties found a response with A. Sobchak, mayor of St. 
Petersburg, when, in January, I was there for the celebration of 
the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the city. I negotiated 
on economic collaboration specifically with Krasnogvardeyskiy 
Rayon, which has "defense" enterprises related to ours. E. 
Shatberger, first deputy chief of the rayon administration, and 
his deputy, A. Kushchak (a native Sevastopolian, incidentally), 
have already been to Sevastopol to conclude a more specific 
agreement. 
  Moscow Mayor Yu. Luzhkov came on 23 February, visited the 
cruiser Moskva, and "blessed" the laying of the foundation stone 
of a home for families of the crew, and we had a chance to talk 
only in the Officers' House, in the interval at the concert. He 
liked the idea, and I received an invitation to Moscow for 
future negotiations. 
  [Sigacheva] But you did not go immediately.... 
  [Semenov] What can you do if Sevastopol has become the most 
"political" city in the CIS: 20 planning sessions, and there 
was, in addition, a special, emergency, session in connection 
with the aggravated economic situation. It was this that 
commissioned me to meet with the Russian and Ukrainian 
leadership. Whereas last year the immense budget deficit was 
closed within the framework of the stabilization program, this 
time L. Kravchuk was unable to say anything reassuring, and when 
the conversation came around to the funding of the fleet, he 
said, approximately: This is your problem, go to Moscow, and 
resolve it there.... It was this "instruction" together with the 
decision of the session and Luzhkov's invitation that compelled 
my trip to Moscow. 
  [Sigacheva] As a suppliant? 
  [Semenov] No. The main purpose was to show at all levels (in 
the State Duma, the Federation Council, and the presidential 
structures) the need for the partial funding of the 
infrastructure and social sphere of city. Some 35,500 of our 
inhabitants are the families of servicemen, and the families of 
workers and employees of naval enterprises constitute more than 
75,000--this is just under one-fourth of the population of the 
city. I had attempted to raise this matter last year during my 
hour-long interview with B. Yeltsin, but the Mukhalatka accords 
on the division of the Black Sea Fleet were all the rage at that 
time, and Boris Nikolayevich believed that economic matters 
should be decided simultaneously with political matters. But 
time was on our side, and the Massandra Protocol was signed, and 
a consensus of the branches of power had, in addition, begun to 
emerge in Russia. And I decided to initiate a decision on the 
question of the inclusion of the funding of Sevastopol in the 
Russian budget. 
  [Sigacheva] The president agreed with you on this occasion? 
  [Semenov] On the basis of my letter containing calculations 
he wrote out a resolution: "To Chernomyrdin, Shumeyko, Rybkin. I 
request consideration of Semenov's appeal in the work on the 
1994 budget." This showed once again that Russia is being true 
to the protocol of the Massandra meeting. 
  [Sigacheva] You met with the same understanding among other 
Russian leaders also? 
  [Semenov] And what I remember particularly is that all of 
them, despite the pressure of work, were able to find the time 
for a comprehensive conversation. The Federal Assembly was at 
that time considering the important question of the Russian 
procurator general, and in the break (from 1400 to 1600 hours) 
Vladimir Filippovich Shumeyko, snatching a bite to eat literally 
on the run, spent the whole of the rest of the time talking with 
me. The conversation with Ivan Petrovich Rybkin was held 
immediately following a sitting of the Duma. And at what time do 
you think I met with Konstantin Fedorovich Zatulin? At nine in 
the evening, immediately following his return from Sochi from 
negotiations with Ardzinba. I also met with important 
entrepreneurs and enterprise leaders, and I had a useful 
conversation (it is already bearing fruit) with the chairman of 
the board of directors of a Russian bank. 
  [Sigacheva] You did not forget about Luzhkov? 
  [Semenov] It was hardest of all for him to find the time, 
and 
we met almost on the eve of my departure, late in the evening. 
He issued a command to his deputies immediately, evidently, 
because it turned out the next day that many questions had 
already been decided: concerning prescription drugs, textbooks 
in Russian, gifts for war veterans (and there are in Sevastopol 
8,500 who took part in the defense and liberation of the city 
alone). In the afternoon a session of the Moscow government 
decided to allocate Sevastopol those same R500 million. In 
addition, at my request Luzhkov gave instructions for the 
preparation of a directive that Sevastopolians coming to Moscow 
not be required to register as "foreigners" and that they pay in 
the hotels the same as Russian citizens. I negotiated on 
specific economic cooperation with V. Shantsev, leader of a 
prefecture of the Yuzhnyy Administrative District. This district 
has many "defense" enterprises and the ZIL, Dinamo, and Ilich 
plant giants (an assassination attempt on the leader of the 
revolution was made at the last named). As we were driving past 
this plant, I remembered familiar words from the school history 
textbook: "We will go another way." And thought: In our time 
this "other way" can only be that of direct, interbusiness 
ties--at enterprise level--and the creation of joint works 
without a backward glance at both the republic and local 
authorities. It would then be immaterial whether this leader or 
the other remained in office--an agreement would not lapse with 
his departure. And the strengthening ties would afford people an 
opportunity to live better--as they deserve. 
  Many candidates for mayor of Sevastopol have now taken up 
the 
idea of a union of Slav states. Viktor Mikhaylovich Semenov is 
already doing everything to ensure that the formation of a 
common economic space already begins....

<F P=106> [Interview with Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy </F>
Saburov by Yelena Gornaya; place and date not given: "Yevgeniy 
Saburov: `Support for the Population Must Be Targeted'"] 
  [Text] A few days ago the Government of Crimea 
submitted to the Supreme Council a proposal to consider the 
question of increasing targeted support for low-income 
population strata. It is no secret that the other side of this 
"coin" is a terribly unpopular increase in bread prices. 
  Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Ye.F. Saburov already had 
occasion to have it out with the people on this subject at the 
beginning of April. After three days of unrest and anxiety, 
everything settled down somehow. Crimean residents and guests 
still eat cheap bread. 
  [Gornaya] So, Yevgeniy Fedorovich, why does the government 
need the extra hassle of targeted support? 
  [Saburov] The government takes a firm position that support 
for the population must be as targeted as possible. This is the 
principle of the social policy during the transition period. We 
can make basic foodstuffs and some services cheaper through 
budget financing of enterprises, or we can give this money 
directly to those who need it most. Aid to enterprises does not 
belong in the category of social programs. What happens when 
subsidies are not targeted? Take the example of bread: In order 
to keep prices down, the bread-baking industry was subsidized, 
which required enormous budget expenditures. Which, by the way, 
came not from some abstract state but from the pocket of that 
same low-income taxpayer. That is, the poor foot the bill for 
the right to buy cheap bread not only for themselves but also 
for well-to-do people, plus visitors. 
  Now, one way or the other, the vacation season has begun. 
Bread production has increased 1.5-fold. We, Crimean residents, 
pay the cost of the additional 50 percent for better-off 
vacationers. By the way, bread in Russia is considerably more 
expensive than in the Crimea, and nobody there is shocked by 
this, because the population's income there is higher. Our 
budget, on the other hand, carries unjustified expenses that do 
not protect anyone here, in the Crimea. This was clear even to 
the previous government. But because of various political events 
and endless elections nobody dared to get rid of the absurdity. 
Completely different mechanisms were utilized. Loans were 
obtained at horrendous interest rates. Paper games were played 
with the cost of flour--ostensibly cheaper flour was used for 
subsidized bread while flour purchased at a higher price was 
sort of set aside for later. And this is how it still goes. At 
the end of summer grain from the new harvest will begin to 
arrive, and then a huge jump in the cost of bread is inevitable. 
  [Gornaya] Especially considering that the yield of grain 
crops is predicted to meet just about half of the need. 
  [Saburov] And not only in the Crimea. The entire south of 
Ukraine was struck by drought. We will have to go quite a 
distance to buy the rest of the grain. Plus rising fuel 
prices--just make a mental calculation how much transportation 
is involved on the path from the field to a loaf of bread. Had 
bread prices been rising gradually, the current expected jump 
would have been substantially smaller. 
  [Gornaya] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, you said all this before in 
mid-spring, when the government attempted to raise prices. But 
then it came out, as the president said, that some additional 
information had not been taken into account, allowing prices to 
be restored apparently without losses for the budget. 
  [Saburov] It is rather awkward for me to criticize the 
president's actions, since I am his deputy. Frankly, Meshkov's 
decision at the time to repeal the announced price increase was 
unexpected for me--after all, concurrence had been reached on 
this issue, and the government could not do something like this 
unilaterally. The explanation is that candidates for deputy 
seats put tremendous pressure on the president at the time. 
Remember the time period between the first and the second round 
of parliamentary elections? You may put it this way: The 
president could not go against the will of the Crimean people 
expressed by the candidates for deputies. From the political 
standpoint, I can understand him. Although from an economic 
standpoint it only swept the problem further under the rug. Now, 
however, in the midst of vacation season, it is simply laughable 
for us to feed visitors at our own expense. 
  The same goes for excise taxes on alcohol. Our wine is 
considerable cheaper than in Russia. Visitors are very happy to 
buy it. If we now introduce a normal excise tax, it will not 
faze these visitors. So why should we provide "free" booze for 
them over the entire vacation season? 
  [Gornaya] In the winter it was said that wine-making 
enterprises had surplus inventories. As I understand it, this 
problem no longer exists, does it? 
  [Saburov] That is why we propose a flexible excise tax that 
envisages regulation both in the event of surplus and when 
demand goes up. The deputies got concerned, however, suspecting 
that it would create conditions for corruption. They started 
talking about auditing the Ministry of Finance. Where will the 
money from redistribution of subsidies go? Well, first, to aid 
low-income people. Second, it is time to start thinking about 
preparations for winter. Schools and other municipal sphere 
facilities will need repairs. And most importantly, we need to 
stockpile fuel. Pump in gas, bring in coal. We are 
catastrophically short on money for these purposes. And at the 
same time, one may say that vacationers are happily drinking up 
our winter fuel. 
  [Gornaya] And you are probably also facing the necessity to 
find the money in the local budget for MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] maintenance... 
  [Saburov] Yes, this will be a considerable amount. We keep 
facing new problems all the time. I am very concerned about the 
situation in Crimean institutions of higher learning. Financing 
from the Ukrainian state budget only covers teachers' pay and 
student stipends. But what about building repairs? Or supply of 
fuel? We have to preserve our institutions of higher 
learning--the only Russian-language higher education schools in 
Ukraine--at any cost. 
  [Gornaya] Our new parliament has abandoned the tradition of 
the old Supreme Council to decide right at the plenary meetings 
the issues involving subsidies, compensations, and so on. And 
has abandoned it so completely that it only "took under 
advisement"-- this was the wording adopted at the presidium 
meeting--all these problems associated with the necessity to 
raise prices and targeted subsidies. Taking into account how 
socially acute this matter is, such a position of people's 
elected representatives does not look very noble. 
  [Saburov] Parliament members like to use the word "ethics." 
Here is a specific situation. Future deputies begged in the 
spring to keep bread prices down. Then they won the election. 
But the problem remains unresolved. The government is ready to 
face the criticism. Nothing we can do about it--this is the fate 
of every government. In this particular case we asked for only 
one thing--for the Supreme Council to approve the government's 
actions with respect to targeted protection of the population. 
But the presidium only "took it under advisement." All right, 
this is a trifle. I am concerned about a different matter: Over 
the period of these entire three months, in all its concrete 
undertakings the government not only has not got any support but 
has more often faced opposition. We came here to work. After 
all, we did not beg to be invited. 
  [Gornaya] Yes, it is not easy to be in the role of the hated 
one... All right, what if this political issue of bread prices 
is again thrown at the mercy of populism? And on top of that we 
will be drinking cheap vodka all summer? 
  [Saburov] We will make it through to the fall. By then we 
will eat up the entire budget. By the time winter comes, we will 
be without fuel and bread. 
  [Gornaya] And then "mommy dearest" will be able to extend a 
helping hand in the form of direct presidential rule. 
  [Saburov] The whole thing is a paradox: What kind of 
independence can there be if we have to crawl for pennies to 
Kiev on every occasion? In order to strengthen Crimean 
independence, which is what the deputies are dreaming of, we 
have to take care of keeping revenue coming into the budget. No 
constitution by itself will feed the people and keep them warm. 
We have to do something, not just talk, in order to attract 
additional money to the Crimea. For instance, our proposals to 
attract money to the Crimea may be implemented instantly, but 
they are stymied time and again by the position of the Republic 
Bank of Crimea. Next. We need to immediately deregulate all 
prices--both industrial and agricultural producers are convinced 
of it. We do not have to fear a sharp jump in prices as it had 
happened in Russia, Here the solvent demand already limits price 
rises. In short, it is time to move to a market economy and stop 
this decay the Crimea has been wallowing in for several years. 
  [Gornaya] Are you sure that the system of targeted support 
will be effective and those who need help will indeed get it? 
  [Saburov] In principle, it already has been worked out and 
in 
operation in the Crimea for quite some time. Currently we are 
only talking about strengthening it. By the way, in April 
certain categories of the population received an anticipatory 
targeted subsidy, and although bread prices were brought back to 
the old level, the subsidy is being paid to this day.

  [Text] Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen began a visit to Belarus on 29 June. Belarusian Foreign 
Minister Pyotr Krawchanka said at a news conference that during 
talks with his Chinese counterpart -- held on the first day of 
the visit -- bilateral cooperation and cooperation within the 
framework of international organizations were discussed. 
  The Chinese side expressed great interest in the extension 
of 
economic relations between the two states. As of today, Belarus 
and China have signed 11 bilateral agreements concerning all 
spheres of cooperation. An agreement to sign new pacts in the 
immediate future on bilateral cooperation in such areas as 
communication and information systems, air traffic, and criminal 
extraditions was reached. A principal decision to draft a 
political agreement between the two states was also adopted. 
All these documents could be signed in late 1994 during a 
planned visit by top Chinese officials to Minsk. Practical 
issues connected with the establishment of joint 
Belarusian-Chinese ventures -- primarily the setting up of a 
joint venture dealing with the assembling and servicing of BELAZ 
trucks on Chinese territory -- were also discussed. Mr. Qian 
Qichen pointed out in his speech that China favors the 
strengthening of Belarusian-Chinese cooperation in all fields. 
The Chinese foreign minister sees the key goal of bilateral 
relations in the implementation of the existing 11 agreements.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian State Duma Representative Anatoliy </F>
Lukyanov, member of the Russian Federation Communist Party 
Central Committee Presidium, by Natalya Bakhir; place and date 
not given: "About the Age-Old Disease of 'Leftism' Among 
Communists"] 
  [Text] The "Russia and Belarus -- Path to the Future" 
conference has recently been held in Minsk. The conference was 
attended by well known Russian politicians. A SEM DNEY 
correspondent attended a meeting with Russian State Duma 
Representative Anatoliy Lukyanov, member of the Russian 
Federation Communist Party Central Committee Presidium. 
  Anatoliy Ivanovich described the current situation in Russia 
as the result of a "the three-year policy of wrecking the 
foundations of people's life." To confirm this, he provided the 
following figures. Decline in production, compared with the 
last year, amounts to 51 percent (27 percent during the first 
five months of this year). About 5,500 Russian enterprises have 
been brought to a standstill, around 400 companies stop working 
every month. Twenty percent of society lives below the poverty 
level, the same amount -- on the verge of poverty. Meanwhile, 
0.3 percent (586 families) of people are billionaires in terms 
of rubles, including Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The 
crime rate has increased by 2.5 times, according to official 
data. Moreover, the current state leadership is blamed for 
allowing the pilferage of public property (which is currently 
governed by the criminal capital), the disruption of economic 
ties, and the subordination of foreign policy to nondomestic 
interests. 
  Anatoliy Lukyanov also responded to some questions. We 
present a few of his answers. 
  [Bakhir] Is Belarus' joining the ruble zone really so 
burdensome to Russia? 
  [Lukyanov] This, in my opinion, is a concoction of people 
who do not want real unification. No ruble zone will diminish 
the loss caused by our disunion. 
  [Bakhir] How do you see the mechanism for cooperation 
among Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, etc.? 
  [Lukyanov] I see it as a massive pressure on the 
authorities, though within the law. In particular, this is the 
establishment of a union of 19 communist parties, the "Accord in 
the Name of Russia" movement, development of a concept to 
restore the Soviet Union, and the September Congress of USSR 
Nations, which should be linked to the establishment of cells to 
support the union. 
  In particular, a special debate in the State Duma was 
devoted 
to relations with Belarus. The conclusion was unequivocal. The 
majority believes that our rapprochement is necessary by any 
means. 
  [Bakhir] Can one presume that the tide of stormy 
events (the State Committee for Emergency Situation [GKChP], the 
October events) came to nothing? 
  [Lukyanov] If the tide had succumbed, there would not have 
been political amnesty. The cause of the GKChP is being 
continued; the trial of Varennikov has just begun. Each one of 
us is interested in defending our comrade, and we intend to 
reveal what we have not been able to reveal before. Now, it is 
completely clear that there was no coup, no blockade of 
Gorbachev's dacha, and so on. Regarding the October events, I 
think that was the authorities' greatest provocation. The 
defenders of the Constitution simply lacked political restraint. 
  [Bakhir] Do you not think that the main reason behind 
these events was the rejection of a class analysis of the 
situation? 
  [Lukyanov] A class analysis is now more important than ever 
before. The Russian Communist Party has not abandoned it. 
There are people, however, who believe that forceful methods 
should be applied now, based on class positions. But, there is 
no revolutionary situation... I sometimes have the impression 
that this is the age-old disease of "leftism" among communists. 
  [Bakhir] What do you think is the weakness of the 
patriotic (communist) movements in the republics? 
  [Lukyanov] It is their disunity, the ambitions of leaders, 
the lack of a real revolutionary situation, and speculations 
with patriotic movements by such populist activists as 
Zhirinovskiy....

<F P=106> [Interview with Alyaksandr Tushynski, Belarusian first </F>
deputy defense minister, by Irina Kovaleva; place and date not 
given: "A Weapon Even in Africa Is Still a Weapon"] 
  [Text] Belarus' profits from the sale of military 
equipment and weapons amounted to $20 million last year. 
Payments for Russian energy sources consumed 30 percent of 
those revenues. A SEM DNEY correspondent has interviewed 
Alyaksandr Tushynski, first deputy defense minister of Belarus. 
  [Tushynski] First of all, I must make it clear that the 
Defense Ministry does not deal with the arms trade. According 
to the government's resolution, only three firms are allowed to 
conduct this kind of business. They look for partners and 
coordinate prices. Then, they submit a contract to our 
ministry, and if the products are included on an appropriate 
list, the Defense Ministry gives the go-ahead for the sale. Our 
responsibility is to prepare the equipment for sale. 
  Anticipating your question, I will tell about the moral 
aspect of the arms trade. Many states do that. We are used to 
emulating the United States. So, the United States is currently 
holding the lead in the world's arms trade. Russia's defense 
industry has practically been dislodged from the former USSR's 
markets. Over the last five years, its exports have decreased 
five-fold, and they now amount to only $2 billion. 
  [Kovaleva] Apparently, the Army is experiencing hard times, 
if servicemen have had to get involved in trade. 
  [Tushynski] Exactly. Only 50 percent of money, which is 
essential to maintain the Army, was allotted for this year. Out 
of this sum, one must allocate funds necessary to dismantle 
conventional weapons in accordance with our international 
commitments. We plan to raise the remaining funds through 
commercial activities. Why should the Army keep its surplus 
weapons? We must sell them in time. No one will buy them in 
five years, and they will have to be scrapped. If we stopped 
trading, what would happen with the staff of the Test Range 
Equipment Plant, whose production is sold in Russia? There are 
many other enterprises that only profit from the sale of 
military equipment and weapons. 
  [Kovaleva] The Defense Ministry is suspected of selling 
weapons to "hot spots." Are these suspicions substantiated? 
  [Tushynski] I can certainly state that we deliver weapons 
only to countries which are not embargoed. You probably have in 
mind Alyaksandr Lukashenka's statement indicating that we have 
sold weapons to Croatia. This statement is groundless. All 
decisions concerning deliveries of weapons are made collectively 
at the governmental level, and they are coordinated with the 
Foreign Ministry, which has a list of states to which arms 
deliveries are allowed. There is a system of strict control, 
providing responsibility of all -- the KGB, the Interior 
Ministry, the Customs Committee, and the Defense Ministry. 
Moreover, an inspection conducted by competent bodies has 
revealed that all contracts were legal, and that they include 
certificates listing the final users. Still, if the military 
equipment has ultimately been resold, this weighs on the buyer's 
conscience. 
  [Kovaleva] Russia is unable to conquer foreign markets. Can 
Belarus do that? 
  [Tushynski] Many of our enterprises are already exporting 
their products. This is excellent equipment, and therefore, 
there is a huge demand for it. However, we must compete for 
markets. I will provide an example. Russia announced that it 
would deliver rocket technology and equipment to India. The 
United States did not wait: Sanctions were imposed on India, 
and the contract was not concluded. 
  [Kovaleva] What does Belarus sell, and for what products is 
there the greatest demand? 
  [Tushynski] To Russia, we sell products from the Test Range 
Equipment Plant, to Africa, South America, and other regions -- 
optical equipment produced by the BelOMO company, night vision 
equipment from Rogachev, tractors from Minsk... We plan to 
expand our markets. After all, during the Soviet Union, 360 
people worked in the trade mission in India alone, moreover, two 
thirds of them dealt with arms deliveries.

  [Text] Tiraspol, 30 Jun (TASS) -- The special state of 
affairs in the Dniester republic has been extended from 1 July 
through 31 August this year. This was made public in a decree 
by Dniester President Igor Smirnov which was broadcast on 
Dniester republic radio on Wednesday [29 June] evening. The 
main motives for extending the special state of affairs, it 
states in the decree, are to help the militia wage the organized 
struggle against crime and to preserve the state system of the 
Dniester-Moldovan republic. 
  Ivan Fuchidzhi, acting minister of internal affairs of the 
Dniester republic, was in favor of the special state of affairs 
being extended in the region. He reported to the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent that the special state of affairs will help the 
militia bodies to purposefully wage the organized struggle 
against crime in the region that has been stepped up of late 
both in Tiraspol and other regions.

  [Text] Bishkek, 30 Jun -- Problems of setting up a 
functional economic union were to have been discussed tomorrow 
in Chimkent by the leaders of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and 
Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan]. However, an ITAR-TASS correspondent has 
learned from reliable sources that the meeting has been 
postponed to 8 July. 
  The Chimkent meeting was planning to discuss setting up 
working bodies to run an economic union of the three republics, 
including an executive committee on deepening economic 
integration. The heads of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kirgizia 
also intend to discuss problems relating to curtailing the 
emigration of Russian-speaking residents in these Central Asian 
republics.

  [Text] Bishkek, 29 Jun (KYRGYZKABAR) -- Military exercises 
on combat readiness will begin in the Republic 1 July, according 
to the press service of the republic's Defense Ministry. The 
aim of the exercises is to hold command and staff training in 
the Republic's Army. It should be added that the government's 
resolution on the progress of the armed forces reform was 
published in the local press today. The resolution notes that 
the military units have not sufficiently mastered combat in the 
mountains and that different kinds of armed forces do not 
interact well. The storage of armaments also has problems. The 
government suggested that the Defense Ministry should elaborate 
a program of state measures on strengthening defense, 
implementation of the reform of the armed forces in the coming 
two years and retaining officers in the army, and sumbit this 
program for the government's consideration.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] President Akayev on Tuesday [28 June] held a full 
government meeting to discuss what could be done to straighten 
out the country's fuel and energy complex and prepare the 
economy for next autumn and winter season. Heads of ministries 
and departments and regional administrators were also involved. 
  Akayev described as hard the situation emerging in the fuel 
and energy complex saying that nothing was being done to start 
preparations for the coming winter. He said the country "will 
find itself in a position worse than last year" unless drastic 
measures were taken soon. 
  Akayev called to step up coal production and work out a 
strategy for the development of the sector including marketing 
opportunities at home and in Central Asia. He backed up a 
proposal to allocate DM 10 million for a coal briquetting 
project expressing confidence about the development prospects of 
the coal industry. 
  However, many speakers called for a 40 million soms worth of 
fuel subsidies arguing that most of the ordinary consumers would 
not be able to buy fuel because of high coal prices and 
transport costs. The president instructed the government to 
allocate 14 million soms to this end, with the remainder to be 
raised by local administrators. IF Note: Kyrgyzstan is 
expected to produce 1.5 million tonnes of coal this year, one 
million tonnes less than it needs. Kazakhstan has now agreed to 
deliver the required amount and agreement was reached on imports 
of one billion cu meters of gas from neighboring Uzbekistan. 
  As a matter of urgency, Akayev called for the national 
economy to be transferred to electricity proposing that the 
government raise 27 million soms to complete two large 
hydro-electric stations at Shamaldy-Sai and Tash-Kumyr. The 
cabinet was also instructed to raise funds for imports of large 
capacity transformer equipment. Akayev approved a recent deal 
with Switzerland which will provide a $10 million credit to put 
up three high capacity transformer substations in the country. ( 
Kyrgyzstan whose annual electricity needs run at 10 billion kWh 
produces 12 billion kWh. Talks are in progress to export extra 
electricity to Kazakhstan -- IF). 
  Akayev said everything must be done to implement the 
energy-saving program which can help the republic save up to one 
third of the total electricity produced. He also called for a 
review of the country's energy development concept taking into 
account the energy situation in neighboring states. 
  Akayev proposed that an integrated research must be 
conducted 
into the sources of power generation with costly fossil fuels to 
be replaced by unconventional sources for electricity generation. 
  He warned that each official would be held responsible for 
the preparation of the country's economy for the coming winter.

  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] We are speaking with Mr. 
Shukurjon Zuhurov, representative of Tajikistan. Mr. Zuhurov, 
representatives of the opposition groups have stated that 
simultaneously with a ceasefire a nationwide amnesty ought to be 
declared. However, the representatives of the state of 
Tajikistan were against this proposal. What was the reason for 
this opposition? 
  [Zuhurov, heard briefly speaking in Tajik, fading into 
Persian translation] The reason for this is as follows: We 
fully agree with this condition. However, we said that we need 
time so that we can return to our country and approach the 
related bodies to look into the cases of those against whom 
criminal proceedings have been issued and to release them from 
prison over a period of time. A document must be formulated and 
a law must be adopted for this. This will require five to 10 
days, or two to three weeks.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 29 Jun -- The convoy of trucks carrying 
humanitarian cargo for the inhabitants of the Pamirs 
successfully surmounted the Khabu-Rabot mountain pass today and 
moved on toward Khorog, the administrative center of the 
Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous oblast of Tajikistan. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent has learned from informed sources in the oblast 
administration that the units of the Collective Peace-keeping 
Forces (CPF) deployed in Tajikistan have remained on the far 
side of the pass. The protection of the convoy and the safety 
of the drivers was undertaken by units of the mountain rifle 
battalion of the republic's Ministry of Defense which is manned 
by young people from the Pamirs and also by self-defense units 
of Gorno-Badakhshan oblast. 
  This agreement was reached during talks between 
representatives of the CPF command, local authorities of 
Gorno-Badakhshan oblast, representatives of the coalition 
council of democratic forces, and some field commanders of 
self-defense units. In the opinion of Ulfat-khanum, one of the 
representatives of the coalition council of the autonomous 
region, the initial decision by the CPF command to accompany the 
humanitarian cargo across the territory of the oblast right to 
Khorog aroused serious concern among the public of the Pamirs. 
They thought there might be provocations from individual forces 
interested in destabilizing the situation in the Pamirs. 
Ulfat-khanum stressed that this concern had been conveyed to the 
CPF command and also to the representative of the UN mission in 
the oblast centre of Khorog and, as a result, a sensible 
compromise had been reached. 
  It is expected that the convoy of trucks carrying foodstuffs 
will arrive in Khorog by this evening. The aid is very timely 
aince the population of Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous oblast is on 
the verge of starvation. Food reserves are virtually exhausted. 
The only bakery in the administrative center has been out of 
action for several days because there is no flour.

  [Text] WE WILL BE BUILDING SECULAR DEMOCRATIC STATE, 
TAJIK OPPOSITION LEADER 
  The second round of the inter-Tajik talks finished in 
Tehran. It brought no peace to the country. The conflict is 
still going on. However, experts believe that negotiations will 
also continue. The Tajik opposition was represented by one of 
its leaders, Co-Chairman of the Movement for Islamic Rebirth of 
Tajikistan, 40-year old Akbar Turajonzoda. He graduated from 
the Bukhar Religious Institute (Medrese), the Islamic Institute 
in Tashkent and the Shariah faculty of the Jordan University. 
During 1989-1992 he was Kazikalon (head of all Muslims) of 
Tajikistan. An INTERFAX correspondent Andrey Zharov is speaking 
to him. 
  INTERFAX: First of all, it is interesting to know how would 
you assess the talks and their results? 
  TURAJONZODA: The beginning of the talks itself proves that 
the international community recognized the opposition as a 
reality. It has realized that not only the Dushanbe regime 
represented the Tajik people. In fact, this means that the 
authorities in Dushanbe regard us as a real political and 
military force defending interests of a significant part of 
Tajik citizens. A half a year ago Dushanbe was calling us 
criminals with "hands in blood." Now Dushanbe understood that 
the situation in Tajikistan could not be settled without 
participation of the opposition. It encourages that we have 
found certain understanding on the part of Russia. The Russian 
leadership also realized that the situation in the republic and 
in the region could not be stabilized without a dialogue with 
the opposition. 
  INTERFAX: With who of high-ranking Russian officials did you 
meet? 
  TURAJONZODA: I met Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Albert 
Chernyshov. We also met a deputy commander-in-chief of the 
border defense troops and a deputy defense minister. 
  INTERFAX: How would you assess the role which Uzbekistan is 
playing in the Tajik conflict? 
  TURAJONZODA: There are many facts proving that the Uzbek 
leadership helped the present Tajik authorities come to power by 
military means. When we took prisoners some militants of the 
People's Front, they often said that they had been armed and 
supplied with money by Uzbek representatives. Some units were 
formed in the Surkhan-Daryin Region (Uzbekistan). 
  Before militants were brought to Tajikistan they had a 
meeting with the Uzbek interior minister and the deputy defense 
minister. We know these facts rather well. These formations 
brought the current regime in Dushanbe to power. 
  INTERFAX: You are blamed for attempts to set up a 
pro-Iranian Islamic regime in the republic. Is this right? 
  TURAJONZODA: I never spoke about this either in my statement 
or in my articles. On the contrary, I have been repeatedly 
stressing that we will be building a secular democratic state. 
The opposition already abolished the Party of Islamic Rebirth. 
The Movement for Islamic Rebirth of Tajikistan was created 
instead of it. Most leaders of the movement are democrats and 
not the so-called Islamists. As a believer and a religious 
activist I would like to live in conformity with my principles 
and Islamic traditions. However, I am a realist. 
  Our people have gone thorough the long-lasting communist 
rule. Islam cannot be imposed. The religion of Muslims does not 
make anybody leave in conformity with its ideology and customs. 
The communist rule showed that people cannot be forced to 
adhere to certain ideology. 
  Communists had used radio, television and other media, were 
bringing up people as Marxists starting from nursery schools. 
Still they failed to kill the faith. How can we repeat this 
mistake by imposing our ideology? 
  However, if the people itself wants to bring some of the 
country's laws in conformity with Islamic traditions through 
elections or a referendum, this is quite possible. However, it 
must be realized that nothing new could be invented in the 
economy. 
  Natural difference exists between the culture, traditions 
and 
vision in various countries. That is why I believe that such 
issues as marriage, divorce, division of property, etc. Can be 
brought to conformity with Islamic traditions but only by a 
civilized way and when the people itself wants this. 
  This could also be done through the parliament. However, I 
am categorically against religious rule in the country. We are 
moving towards the 21st century and we cannot go back to a 
theocratic state. We will not force women to cover their face. 
  INTERFAX: How does the opposition see the future of 
Tajikistan? 
  TURAJONZODA: The opposition proposes to create an interim 
government in which neither the present leadership nor we would 
take part. Those who are not guilty of stirring up the 
fratricidal war must come to power. During two years refugees 
will return. Political parties, including Communists and those 
participating in the current regime will be acting freely. The 
media must also be free. 
  Under the mediation of the UN and monitors from other 
countries a new constitution will be created which will say that 
Tajikistan is a secular democratic country where religion is 
separated from the state and which recognizes the right for 
private property. The Fundamental Law will also include 
provisions on democratic liberties. 
  The constitution must say that no political regime will have 
the right to change it during the next 30 or 50 years, neither 
we nor any other party which may come to power. Nobody will 
have the right to build the state basing on other principles, I 
told Chernyshov. We regret that Russians are frightening 
themselves with a scare-crow of Islamic fundamentalism. 
  INTERFAX: How do you think the talks between the Tajik 
leadership and the opposition can be sped up? 
  TURAJONZODA: The delegations must be of a high level so that 
the talks be not delayed. Now, to tell the truth, the Dushanbe 
delegation includes no representatives of the regions from which 
the people in power have come. 
  The leaders of the present regime have all come from one 
region - Kulyab. This includes E.Rakhmonov (the Chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet), A.Dostiyev (his deputy), the interior minister, 
the security minister, the minister for foreign economic 
relations, the health minister, the deputies defense minister 
and all regional heads. Even in Khojent (former Leninabad - 
the Motherland of Turajonzoda) the prosecutor general is from 
Kulyab. People from Kulyab have all political, power and, as 
they say, beneficial, posts. However, none of them is in the 
official delegation. 
  There is a way to make Dushanbe be more active during the 
talks - military pressure, I told Chernyshov. However, most 
politicians do not want to see the obvious until there is a 
bloodshed. 
  In particular, the Russian Foreign Ministry's Envoy A.Orlov 
affirmed that the situation is calm in Dushanbe and that the 
government is controlling the situation. Probably, we have to 
display our military force to change this deceitful image. 
  Many people do not believe us thinking that the government 
is 
really controlling the situation. However, it is quite clear 
that Dushanbe agreed to negotiate ceding to Moscow's pressure. 
The present regime needs no talks. Russian troops are 
defending the borders. Russia supplies Tajikistan with cash 
money and food products. Why will the current leaders resign? 
The problem is a heavy burden for Russia and Russian citizens 
are killed in Tajikistan as a result. 
  INTERFAX: What is the attitude of your movement towards 
Russia given presence of Russian forces in your country? 
  TURAJONZODA: The Movement of Islamic Rebirth of Tajikistan 
does not oppose good relations between Russia and our country. 
We propose an honest variant - appointment of a temporary 
government - and are ready to consider candidacy of every member 
of the Cabinet together with Moscow and other interested states. 
I think that the security bodies have dossiers for every of the 
possible candidates and Moscow can easily learn everything about 
anyone of them. 
  We are not Russia's adversaries and recognize its 
geopolitical interests in Tajikistan. Our Movement is well 
aware of the fact that none of the states of the world can 
substitute Russia in the republic. We have no such close 
relations with any other state, our economy and infrastructures 
are "interrelated" with the Russian Federation. 
  There are forces in the world which are interested in the 
development of this conflict. Unfortunately Russia is being 
more and more involved into the war, and this results in the 
appearance of national enmity. In addition, the Russian 
Federation is forced to spend great funds and forces in 
Tajikistan thus distracting from other important problems. 
  Several countries will assist us in waging this war not 
because of their love with respect to us but in order to weaken 
Russia. It became especially obvious after the victory of 
Zhirinovsky's party at the elections to the State Duma. He 
openly declared about his intention to restore the Russian 
empire and about his plans to seize territories from 
Constantinople to Tehran. Many people in this regions are 
greatly concerned over these statements and they are ready to 
support us. We spoke about this with Mr A.Chernyshev. I 
believe that our task is to bring this information to Russia's 
people and Russian politicians are to adopt their decision. 
  INTERFAX: Several terroristic acts against Russian 
servicemen both in the capital and other cities have been 
registered over the last period in Tajikistan. Has the Movement 
something to do with these acts? 
  TURAJONZODA: I assert that the Movement for Islamic Rebirth 
has not planned any acts with respect to Russian citizens and 
Russian servicemen, especially in populated centers. We still 
believe that Russia is the major guarantor of security and 
integrity of our state and our ally. 
  I think that these terroristic acts have been accomplished 
by 
those forces which want to deeper involve Russia into the mire 
of the Tajik war, to force it to increase its military presence, 
and to encounter great expenditures. In fact, this reminds the 
events which happened with the Russian army in Afghanistan when 
it was bogged down in the armed struggle with the opposition. 
We do not want this. Those circles which do not want to 
completely settle the Tajik conflict by political means strive 
for this variant. I hope that Russian politicians have enough 
sound sense to understand who stands behind these terroristic 
acts. 
  In addition, as far as the recent shelling of the bus with 
Russian frontier guards is concerned I can say that if our 
people had shot from mortars they would not have missed this 
target. I assure you. The attackers probably wanted to 
frighten Russians and to aggravate the tension. 
  INTERFAX: I'd like to return to the subject on negotiations 
and I'd like to know what was discussed at the second round of 
the negotiations in Tehran? 
  TURAJONZODA: We were talking only about temporary cease-fire 
for the period of negotiations and have not started 
consideration of the agenda yet. We have determined that 
ceasefire should be kept at least till October 1 but we have 
failed to adopt any final decision and have not signed any 
document. 
  INTERFAX: Do you hope that this agreement will be reached? 
  TURAJONZODA: If we did not hope we did not spend time for 
negotiations and deceived our people. We have hope but we have 
no conviction. 
  The delegation from Dushanbe asserts that it strives for a 
cease- fire agreement but it does not want to include the word 
"temporary" into the document. We believe that such agreements 
on cease-fire are senseless if they do not lead to a final 
political settlement of the problem. 
  During the first round of the negotiations in Moscow our 
delegation proposed to sign an agreement on a temporary mutual 
cease-fire under observance of certain confidence measures in 
order to make the negotiations process normal. However, the 
other side set forth quite unacceptable conditions. Rejecting 
temporary nature of the agreement, the Dushanbe delegation 
believes that cease-fire should be observed only by the 
opposition and only on the state border. As for us, we want to 
develop a serious document which will be in force throughout the 
whole territory of the republic but not only within the border 
zone. 
  In addition, our party persists in creation of a control 
mechanism to observe this agreement with the involvement of the 
UN supervisors and introduction of checking posts in hot-spots 
within the republic as well. We believe that re-deployment of 
Dushanbe's armed forces and Russian forces should be banned for 
this period. The main thing is to mutually observe the 
cease-fire regime. 
  INTERFAX: There are many refugees from Tajikistan in Russia 
and other CIS countries. What is your assessment of this 
situation?. 
  TURAJONZODA: The Tajik refugees in the Russian Federation 
receive practically no aid. And they do not need it. It's 
quite enough for those Tajiks who live in Moscow and other 
regions of Russia that nobody makes them return to Tajikistan by 
force. For example, over the last time the Moscow militia 
captured refugees and forwarded them to their homeland by train. 
Can we solve this problem in such a way? 
  These people will not be able to live in Tajikistan, a civil 
war is being waged there, there are no working places for them 
and there are many economic difficulties. A forced expulsion of 
refugees from Russia arouses a negative attitude towards 
Russians as well as among Afghans especially after the USSR army 
was waging a war against them for ten years. 
  Sometimes refugees just have no money in order to buy food 
products and clothes. Their houses have been damaged or seized 
by other people. Men are forced to go to Afghanistan and to 
export contraband, drugs and weapons, in order to sell them. 
They are forced to join various combat formations in order to 
earn some money.

  [Text] Baku, June 28 (TURAN) -- Baku is deeply concerned 
about the statements repeatedly distributed by Armenians 
officials in Yerevan and Khankendi (Stepanakert), which report 
that "Azerbaijan prepares an offensive towards 
Nagorno-Karabakh", an employee of Azerbaijan's Presidential 
staff told TURAN. 
  "Such irresponsible statements do not allow to create 
favourable conditions for settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
conflict. Both parties to the conflict have to be responsible 
for their activities", reports the same source. 
  The Republic of Azerbaijan calls upon the Armenian 
authorities and the heads of Armenian community of 
Nagorno-Karabakh not to break the peace settlement process and 
not to destabilize the situation. 
  On June 25 ITAR-TASS referring to military leaders of 
Nagorno-Karabakh distributed a statement about Azerbaijan's 
preparations to a large-scale offensive.

  [Text] Tehran June 29 TASS -- President of Azerbaijan 
Geydar Aliyev arrived in the Iranian capital Tehran on a 
four-day official visit today. At Tehran's Mehrabad airport, 
Aliyev told journalists that "Azerbaijan regards Iran as a 
powerful and influential neighbour, and is ready to develop 
cooperation with it in all spheres." 
  Aliyev said he will hold talks with Iranian President 'Ali 
Akbar- Rafsanjani and other Iranian leaders to discuss issues of 
regional and world policy as well as prospects for expanding 
bilateral relations between the two countries. 
  Receiving Aliyev, Hashemi-Rafsanjani emphasised the 
historical, religious and ethnic closeness of the two people. 
The Iranian head of state noted that many accords, which were 
achieved during the Iranian president's visit to Baku last year, 
are in the stage of implementation, and the remaining will 
require some time to be put into life. The Iranian president 
also expressed concern over the unabated bloodshed in the 
Trans-Caucasus region.

  [Text] Baku, June 29, (TURAN)--"The usage of Gabala 
Radio-Locating Station and other military objects situated on 
Azerbaijan's territory is possible if they are not harmful to 
ecology, economy and interests of the republic", reads the 
statement distributed by the members of political parties and 
public organizations of Azerbaijan yesterday. 
  The results of the Commission of the Milli Mejlis for Gabala 
Radio-Locating Station were read out in the headquarters of 
Musavat party on Saturday. 
  The Commission stated that the station radiates 
high-frequency electric magnetic waves, which are very harmful 
for flora, fauna and population of the region. 
  In accordance with the Presidential Decree from December 16, 
1991 and the resolution of the Milli Mejlis from April 8, 1992, 
all military objects on the territory of Azerbaijan have been 
nationalized. However, the Gabala Radio-Locating Station is 
still runned by Russian servicemen. Azerbaijan and Russia have 
not reached an agreement concerning this issue. 
  An employee of Russian Embassy in Azerbaijan, Colonel 
Vladimir Pavlenko, mentioned that few are the stations in the 
world like the Gabala Radio-Locating Station, which work in 
automatic regime. According to Pavlenko, the station is able to 
follow the space objects within the distance of 10,000 
kilometres. The Gabala RadioLocating Station is of strategic 
importance in the system of anti-air defense. 
  Pavlenko said that the Radio-Locating Station has resources 
for 20-25 upcoming years. "The station is not harmful for 
fauna, flora and the population, on the contrary, it can be very 
useful", said Vladimir Pavlenko. 
  An employee of the State Committee for ecology, Fikret 
Jafarov, however, said that the station works in a freezing 
regime. "It is a common knowledge that this regime is used with 
highfrequency electric magnetic waves, which are very harmful", 
said Jafarov.

  [Text] Yerevan June 29 TASS -- A team of international 
experts arrived on Wednesday in Yerevan to examine the Armenian 
nuclear power plant. 
  The team consists of representatives of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who will examine the reactors, 
pipes, steam generators and other parts vital for the safety of 
the plant. 
  IAEA expert Eduard Saakov representing the research 
institute 
Rosenergoatom told ITAR-TASS that the team has a lot of work to 
do. He pointed out the high professional level of the plant's 
employees, which, he stressed, is crucial for its future 
operation. He also said that the IAEA experts have supported 
the plan of measures proposed by Armenian specialists to 
increase the safety of the plant. 
  He refrained from naming concrete dates when the plant can 
resume operation. Saakov stressed that this can occur only 
after the completion of work to increase its safety. 
  The head of the group, Bernard Gachot, noted that the IAEA 
does not provide financial support, but can facilitate the 
search for investors at the political level. 
  Armenian Prime Minister Vigen Chitechyan said the Armenian 
government expects to receive a report from the group in two 
weeks.

<F P=106> ["US Looks for Armenian Plumbers with BA's in English" -- </F>
ITAR-TASS headline; by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] 
  [Text] Yerevan June 30 TASS -- The United States Embassy in 
Armenia has placed ads in local newspapers with job offers for a 
plumber and an electrician who have an excellent knowledge of 
the English language. This, coming after other recent embassy 
advertisements for a car mechanic and several cleaning ladies 
who specialised in foreign languages. Such comic naivety on the 
Americans' part has given rise to lively commentaries in the 
local press. 
  The Yerevan newspaper "LRAGIR" can just picture some 
university student or graduate from a foreign language 
department devoting his or her youth to freeing the U.S. Embassy 
from unpleasant toilet odors in flawless English. Why not, 
muses the author, introduce some new courses in the foreign 
language faculties of the republic's institutions of higher 
education: English Plumbing 101, Basic English Slang for 
Drivers, Watchmen and Laborers in Shakespeare's Works. 
  The capital newspaper did not stop there. Why not begin 
intensive language courses in Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and so 
on? For every language there should be at least one embassy, 
which, the paper concluded, would therefore be able to employ 
local language specialists looking for work as plumbers and 
cleaners. It just may be a solution for Armenia's college 
graduates searching for employment on the republic's difficult 
job market.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Bablumyan: "Armenia Has No Money To </F>
Escort Prisoners"] 
  [Text] Yerevan -- Eight highly dangerous criminals 
arrested outside of Armenia are once again at liberty -- without 
going through the trial and investigation that would have 
awaited them in their native land. They did not even try to 
flee or bribe the guards. They were simply released to the four 
winds, since the Armenian Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] did 
not have the 33 million rubles needed to pay for the prisoners 
to be escorted to their place of permanent residence. 
  IZVESTIYA was told by Gayk Arutyunyan [name as 
transliterated], the republic's first deputy minister of 
internal affairs, that there were 1,364 criminals being sought 
at the start of the year, and, although this figure has fallen 
somewhat, the problem of finding them and bringing them back is 
still very acute. Everything depends on the financial resources 
of the MVD, and these -- according to Colonel Arutyunyan -- are 
very limited. 
  Meanwhile, the republic's Finance Ministry has turned down 
the MVD's request to be allocated 3 billion drams, cutting the 
sum to 836 million. That kind of money will not make it very 
easy to do the job, the police department believes. 
Particularly when you consider that an ordinary policeman's 
salary in Armenia is equivalent to $1.80, and the extra pay for 
being a general is equivalent to just 10 cents. So the 
criminals can sleep easy for the time being. What cannot be 
cured has to be endured.

  [Text] The Georgian Prime-Minister Otar Patsatsia has 
categorically denied Abkhaz reports about the beginning of the 
mass uncontrolled arrival of Georgian refugees in the Gali 
region. At a meeting with the local administration and law 
enforcement officers in Zugdidi on Wednesday he said false 
reports are spread to undermine the normal return of refugees. 
  The prime-minister said that the most important stage after 
the appearance of peace-keeping forces in the security zone is 
the return of refugees. Any obstacles to the process should be 
removed. Everything is going to be done in keeping with the 
four-sided agreements.

  [Excerpts] The information center reporting on the 
all-round settlement of the Abkhazian conflict reports from 
Zugdidi that Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia and Jaba 
Ioseliani, chairman of the interim Committee for Emergency 
Situations, arrived in Zugdidi today. [passage omitted] 
  A meeting took place with representatives of the command 
staff of the peacekeeping forces. A number of important issues 
were discussed. It was pointed out that the motor bridge over 
the Inguri River is practically restored. Checkpoints were 
established at both ends of the bridge and the important 
location is under complete control of the peacekeeping forces. 
  The Enguri hydroelectric power station and its security and 
operation were seriously considered. The station as well as 
other important objects are guarded by units of peacekeeping 
forces stationed in the area. Thus, the Abkhaz side has no 
formal reasons to limit power supplies. A common opinion was 
voiced on ways to prevent the Abkhaz side from resorting to such 
actions. This is expected to happen in the near future. 
  As for security in the zone, the representatives of the 
peacekeeping forces said that the number of observation points 
and checkpoints established there ensures security. It was also 
mentioned that there is a greater number of checkpoints in Gali 
Rayon. 
  The Georgian side voiced several considerations, namely, the 
failure to make an official decision on the participation of all 
sides in manning the checkpoints. Because of the Abkhazian 
side's opposition, representatives of the Georgian side have not 
been involved in the operation of the Sukhumi territorial 
headquarters of peacekeeping forces. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Marcelino Oreja, European commissioner for </F>
transport and energy, by Francisco de Andres in Brussels; date 
not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [De Andres] What, Mr. Oreja, 
are your ambitions as a commissioner? 
  [Oreja] Basically that of encouraging the European Union 
[EU] to respect the member states' national identities. There 
is no incompatibility between the European interest and that of 
each particular nation, because the former is not something 
abstract: It is a real interest formed by that of the states 
comprising the Community. 
  [De Andres] Which values, in your opinion, should the EU 
recover or highlight in order to surmount the disenchantment 
caused by its apparent powerlessness in the face of problems 
such as unemployment, the Yugoslav crisis, or the internal 
differences over the model of [European] building? 
  [Oreja] I believe that, above all, it is necessary to 
implement the Maastricht Treaty to the letter, and, at the same 
time, to ensure that citizens know what is being done. In my 
opinion, the greatest failure on the part of the EU and the 
Commission has been the difficulty which they have encountered 
in convincing citizens that what is being done is something that 
directly affects their interests and ideals. 
  [De Andres] To what do you attribute this lack of 
understanding between the Community authorities and the public? 
  [Oreja] There are perhaps several reasons. There is an 
economic crisis which creates the temptation to renationalize 
policies, forgetting that a better solution to the potential 
problems which arise in the member states can often be found 
within the European framework. And then there is another crisis 
-- very grave, in my opinion -- which is the very widespread 
crisis of values in Europe. In my opinion, this situation 
requires greater vigilance, on the part not only of the 
governments but also of the citizens themselves, through 
associations and intermediate bodies. Indifference to moral 
values is a very worrying sign of our times, and, in my opinion, 
their recovery depends very much on economic recovery. 
  [De Andres] Owing to the circumstances, you will keep Abel 
Matutes' portfolios -- transport and energy -- until the end of 
this year. Do you see yourself holding other responsibilities, 
perhaps in the area of the Community's external policy, in the 
next European Commission? 
  [Oreja] One of the customs hitherto observed in the 
Commission is that a country does not repeat portfolios, 
although there is no written rule. In any event, I feel very 
content with the energy and transport portfolio, because it has 
a content characteristic of the treaty's "heart." 
  [De Andres] During your predecessor's time in the post, 
there was talk of a tacit "nonaggression pact" between Abel 
Matutes and Spanish official policy. Your appointment to the 
post of European commissioner has also required the support of 
Felipe Gonzalez' government. Who will prevail? Marcelino Oreja 
the diplomat or the Christian Democratic politician? 
  [Oreja] In the first place, I wish to point out that it is a 
matter not of a policy of "nonaggression" but of a policy of 
cooperation. In my opinion, irrespective of the still existing 
ideological differences, there should be good cooperation 
between the two Spanish citizens working in the Commission for 
one fundamental reason -- in order to make known, when 
necessary, the situation in one of the member states, which is 
the one which we know best. I emphasize that this is not to the 
detriment of our main task, which is safeguarding the European 
interest. 
  [De Andres] Nevertheless, do you also intend to be 
responsive to the Community interests outlined by Madrid? 
  [Oreja] There is an article in the treaty which is 
categorical and which lays down that a commissioner can receive 
no instruction from a government or from any other institution 
or association. This does not prevent my having a good 
relationship with the government and with all the Spanish social 
and economic sectors, because the commissioner must make known 
the situation in the state to which he belongs in the Community 
executive's deliberations. In my case, both my political career 
and my ideology -- which conforms to the principles of Christian 
humanism -- are unequivocal, and I will never renounce what is 
part of myself. 
  [De Andres] You have made several references to your role as 
a communicator of the situation in Spain, whose image is not at 
its best right now.... 
  [Oreja] I would like to explain that the commissioner's role 
is not to sell his country's image, this is the responsibility 
of the minister or the ambassador. Everybody must know how to 
play his role. In what I believe to be the defense of national 
interests, insofar as they coincide with European interests -- 
and they should be able to do so -- I see no reason for not 
performing the task well. 
  [De Andres] Do you see Spain in the third stage of Economic 
and Monetary Union in 1997? 
  [Oreja] It seems very difficult to me at present. In fact, 
it is also difficult to make forecasts right now. Two months 
ago, I would have said that it was impossible that there could 
be a sufficient "critical mass" of countries at the end of 1996 
to open the way to monetary union. Right now, the fact is that 
four new states are preparing to join the EU, and they will 
probably meet the Maastricht criteria in inflation and the 
public deficit. Today Spain is very far from achieving these 
results, at least in some of the convergence criteria. 
  [De Andres] What consequences would this "uncoupling" from 
the economies of the north have? 
  [Oreja] I believe that ensuring that the convergence process 
continues is more important than whether monetary union occurs 
in 1997 or 1999, and to this end appropriate economic policies 
must be adopted. As long as there are countries which have 
higher wage costs, energy costs, and fiscal and financial costs 
than the other countries, this gap will be sustained for want of 
the necessary competitiveness. The problem of competitiveness 
does not mainly concern enterprises but rather the economic 
policies mistakenly advocated by some European countries. 
  [De Andres] Together with the possible creation of the 
single currency, another of the key tasks of the next European 
Commission will be the cooperation with the 1996 
intergovernmental conference, which is to establish the new 
balances of power within the Community. How could Spain be left 
politically after that occasion? 
  [Oreja] This is a very important matter for Europe's future, 
and so there should be no improvisation. I believe that in 1996 
it is necessary also to involve the Commission and the 
Parliament, together with the personal representatives of the 
heads of government. I understand that there could be different 
rates of integration, provided that the final aim is for this to 
affect all the member states. 
  [De Andres] What impact, in your opinion, will next month's 
elections to the European Parliament have? Will they be just a 
settling of scores over national issues? 
  [Oreja] I believe that the "European" impact of those 
elections will be slight at the time that they are held, but 
important in its consequences from 13 June onward, because it 
makes a difference whether the future parliamentary majority is 
Socialist or People's Party.

<F P=106> [Otmar Lahodynsky report: "No EU Military for a Long Time </F>
Yet"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- "There will certainly be no European 
defense structure before the year 2000. This process simply 
takes time." In an interview with DIE PRESSE, Swedish Defense 
Minister Andres Bjork explained that the European Union [EU] is 
not yet prepared for a joint military policy. 
  The politician does not expect any decisions on military 
cooperation to be made at the EU government conference planned 
for 1996. "Every member country will have a veto right there." 
However, the war in former Yugoslavia shows every day "that we 
need a European security structure," the former secretary 
general of the Council of Europe said. 
  Sweden will continue its nonaligned foreign policy also in 
the European Union. Bjork rules out NATO membership for Sweden 
over the long term; relations with the Western European Union 
[WEU] will depend on the government conference in 1996. 
However, Sweden is banking on cooperation with NATO and 
therefore also participates in the Partnership for Peace [PFP]. 
"Sweden's neutrality policy will not be affected by it." 
  Bjork also expects useful information of the NATO 
cooperation 
program. For example, a talk on security in the Baltic area, in 
which Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev also participated, 
took place on the sidelines of the NATO meeting. 
  Bjork rejects a change of the treaty on conventional armed 
forces, which was suggested by Grachev and would permit the 
transfer of a large number of Russian troops and tanks in the 
area of St. Petersburg. "This question is not to be dealt with 
within the framework of the PFP, but in Vienna." 
  Bjork gave an evasive answer to the question of whether 
Austria should not also accede to NATO's PFP after Sweden and 
Finland. "The government in Vienna must decide this." He does 
not see any problems because of the neutral status. "Sweden 
will continue to stick to its independent defense. Since we 
have not been attacked since 1894, it seems to be very 
efficient." With an ironic undertone, Bjork added: "I always 
use this argument to get more money for our army from the 
Finance Ministry. Unfortunately, I am not always successful."

of 800,000 Jobs"] 
  [Text] Milan -- Privatizations in Europe might entail the 
loss of over 800,000 jobs by the end of 1998. This is one of 
the main conclusions reached by six major European research 
institutes, including the Italian institute "Prometeia," in a 
report on economic prospects in the Old World. The research 
centers -- part of the Ereco network -- surveyed over 120 
businesses in the European Union and EFTA (European Free Trade 
Association) countries, employing 3.5 million people overall, 
and destined to be put up for sale on the market within the next 
few years. Over one-fifth of the workforce currently employed 
in these businesses will lose its jobs as a result of increased 
competition in Europe. The hardest-hit countries will be France 
(290,000 jobs lost), Italy (180,000 jobs lost), and Germany, 
where future job losses are estimated at 140,000.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Elisa Guimaraes Ferreira: "White Books and </F>
Green Books" -- first paragraph is PUBLICO introduction] 
  [Text] The citizens of Europe, lulled by bureaucrats and 
supported by funds, increasingly aspire to a peaceful spot in 
the protective shade of bureaucracy and have distanced 
themselves more and more from any ambition to create competitive 
and dynamic enterprises. 
  Although history demonstrates that the Old Continent always 
manages in the end, for better or worse, to find solutions to 
apparently dramatic crises, the construction of Europe--at least 
at the pace and with the enthusiasm with which it progressed 
starting in the middle of the 1980's--appears to have reached an 
impasse. 
  More serious than this, at times one has the feeling that 
Europe is increasingly lacking in thinkers and politicians of 
sufficient stature and charisma to reach the citizen and, in 
some way, to touch him--not to say excite him--to mobilize him 
behind an ideal that is not limited to the ambition to consume 
more and better products. 
  The Old Europe appears to be showing troubling signs of real 
aging, in terms of lack of imagination, excessive bureaucracy, 
and the "officialization" of the system. 
  Without going into a discussion of the very serious 
manifestations of this tendency (such as the relative 
unreadability, for most citizens, of such basic documents as the 
Single Europe Act or the Maastricht Treaty, a situation which is 
even worse when the respective government leaders determine that 
it is irrelevant to submit them to debate and referendum), it is 
at the very least troubling to look upon the dearth of ideas and 
the "deja vu" of the solutions recently appearing in such highly 
publicized and much discussed documents as the so-called green 
book ("European Social Policy--Options for the Union") or the 
white book ("Growth, Competitiveness, Employment--Challenges and 
Pathways to the 21st Century"). 
  Both documents are a perfect illustration of the impasse 
that 
has been reached with regard to the evolution of the European 
Union and, moreover, of the inability to arrive at a convincing 
way out. The central issue is that, for many and various 
reasons, Europe is faced with a massive 17 million unemployed 
(who cannot be seen as occasionally or temporarily jobless), a 
situation which is not showing any significant signs of abating 
naturally. 
  There are those who will say that unemployment is the price 
to pay for increased productivity, technological innovation, and 
the corresponding replacement of men by machinery. In fact, 
there are many examples of this; assessments of the French 
chemical industry, for instance, reveal that whereas production 
rose by 51 percent between 1980 and 1992, employment fell by 12 
percent. Studies at the company level confirm this trend, as 
producers in various sectors (aluminum, glass, etc.) today need 
40 to 50 percent of the workers they needed in 1981 to achieve 
the same volume of production. 
  However, when it is acknowledged in the forward of the white 
book itself, that in the last 20 years the European Union has 
been losing ground to Japan and the United States in terms of 
foreign market shares, research and development, and economic 
growth, it would be expected that the problem of unemployment 
would afflict the latter powers much more than the European 
continent, which was apparently less actively engaged in the 
productivity race. 
  Hence it is strange that, in the European Union, the 
unemployed represent 11 percent of the active civilian 
population (unemployment has risen regularly since the beginning 
of the 1970's, except for the period between 1986 and 1990), 
whereas the jobless rate has not gone beyond 7 percent in the 
United States and is barely 2.5 percent in Japan. Thus there 
seems to be no doubt that, for all that unemployment is a world 
problem, it must be admitted that it has a specifically European 
mien and salience. 
  And it is precisely in the specifically European proposals 
intended to point toward a solution to the problem that the 
dearth of ideas becomes dramatic, particularly when it is argued 
that the European Union cannot be seen as a merely economic 
project, but is, above all, a political project with determined 
social goals and a humanistic conception of the rights and 
guarantees of the workers. 
  Thus the response to an issue of this dimension and with 
this 
degree of political and social risk must necessarily call for 
deeper and more radical thinking than the mere reiteration, by 
the officials of the Commission and their advisors, that the key 
to the problem will be in the introduction of some modifications 
to the system of education and professional training, the 
strengthening of the social dialogue, the stimulation of 
competition within the single market, the creation of a 
trans-European communications network, the encouragement of 
research and development, and the vitalization of activities in 
support of the aged, children, etc. There is nothing radically 
new in these proposals, nothing that has not been said and tried 
in the past, nor can one hope for results that will be powerful 
enough to check or reverse the hemorrhage. 
  In fact, the European Union seems more and more to be 
approaching relative isolation from the outside and real world, 
making decisions based on documents of an academic tone, 
prepared more to respond belatedly to requests for reports than 
to come up with serious solutions to the real problems (it is 
seen how Europe moved toward the single market, with political 
decisions based merely on estimates of the corresponding 
positive impact on some economic variables, and how, when such 
estimates were not confirmed, it simply undertook further 
studies on how to relaunch employment and competition...). 
  Since the degree of exaction is relatively limited, who 
better than the Community officials, assisted by their advisers, 
to justify "a priori" the merit of certain hypotheses and to 
find "a posteriori" reasons for their failure? Meanwhile, they 
are always putting forward lines of thinking whose utility is 
closely linked to the criteria for the management of the 
structural funds, which are the true sources of power and 
influence. 
  Thus Europe is closing up, becoming artificial and 
bureaucratized, managed by civil servants and supported by 
funds. And, dangerously, the entire social structure is 
beginning to fall under the influence of this way of life. 
  An article appearing recently in NEWSWEEK notes that, since 
1990, the European Union--which has one-third again as many 
inhabitants as the United States--has generated only 20 percent 
as many jobs as the United States (8 million jobs, as against 41 
million jobs); perhaps even more telling is the fact that 
between 1970 and 1991, the United States created six new jobs in 
the private sector for each new job in the public sector, 
whereas the European Union only created less than two new public 
jobs for each new job in the private sector! [as published] 
  And this may be the greatest risk hanging over Europe. In 
this rut, the citizens of Europe, lulled by bureaucrats and 
supported by funds, increasingly aspire to a peaceful spot in 
the protective shade of the bureaucracy and have distanced 
themselves more and more from any ambition to create competitive 
and dynamic enterprises. It might be more worthwhile to promote 
deep and straightforward reflection regarding issues of this 
kind than to engage in discussions that are only seemingly 
broad, considering that the documents under discussion are 
themselves grievously limited.

<F P=106> [By Padraic Flanagan, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Text] A high-ranking Iranian diplomat has been ordered out 
of Britain after a top-level meeting with the Foreign Office, it 
was disclosed today. The expulsion order is the latest in a 
series of rows between the two countries. 
  Iran's charge d'affaires Gholamreza Ansari was told of the 
decision on Thursday [26 May] when he was summoned to see 
Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg, according to THE 
GUARDIAN newspaper. 
  The Foreign Office refused to comment on the expulsion, but 
officials confirmed the meeting took place. 
  The expulsion follows a row over British charges that the 
Iranian intelligence services had been in contact with the IRA. 
Tehran denied the charge and claimed that Britain had bugged 
its London embassy. 
  Relations between Britain and Iran have been strained since 
the Islamic revolution in 1979. Ties between the two countries 
were severed in 1989 over the Salman Rushdie affair, when 
Iranian religious leaders issued a fatwa [Islamic legal ruling] 
calling for the killing of the author. But links were restored 
the following year.

<F P=106> [Julie Kirkbride and Philip Jonston report: "Major Calls </F>
For Tough Line on Beggars"] 
  [Text] The Prime Minister called last night for laws 
against beggars to be rigorously applied to remove their 
"offensive and unjustified" presence from the streets. Mr 
Major's remarks ignited a fierce political controversy -- 
fuelled by the approach of next month's European elections -- as 
Opposition MPs and charity groups accused him of shrugging off 
responsibility for dealing with the homeless. 
  But Conservatives said the Prime Minister had struck a 
populist chord that would be welcomed in cities where vagrancy 
and aggressive begging posed a threat to tourism and trade. 
  In an interview with the EVENING POST in Bristol -- where a 
petition was signed last year demanding action against beggars 
and down-and-outs -- Mr Major said: "The problem about begging 
is as old as the hills. It is very offensive to many people. 
In areas like the West Country where a good part of their 
prosperity depends on tourism, it is damaging to everybody if 
that sort of activity continues." 
  Mr Major -- who described beggars as an eyesore and urged 
people to report them to the police -- said the benefit system 
meant there was no need to resort to begging. But he did not 
believe new laws were needed. 
  "We have rigorous penalties against it and I think we should 
not shrink from using these penalties," he said. 
  Vagrancy laws date from after the Napoleonic Wars, when they 
were introduced to force off the streets former soldiers living 
rough. Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act begging is not 
an arrestable offence, although someone can be taken into 
custody if they give a false name, cause an obstruction or fail 
to give an address. 
  However, there are tougher penalties, with fines of up to 
1,000 pounds and a three-year maximum jail term for violent 
behaviour. 
  Although Downing Street said the Prime Minister was merely 
restating Government policy and had been responding to questions 
put by the local paper, such comments in the middle of an 
election campaign inevitably generated a heated debate. 
  Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, accused Mr Major 
of "picking on the powerless" and the party's president, Mr 
Charles Kennedy, said: "It takes one political down-and-out to 
spot another." 
  Mr Gordon Brown, shadow Chancellor and a possible candidate 
for the Labour leadership, speaking at a European election 
meeting in Morecambe, said: "John Major blames everyone but 
himself. He attacks the poor instead of poverty. He simply 
does not understand what 15 years of Tory rule have done." 
  Mr John Battle, Labour's shadow housing minister said: "Many 
young people are forced to beg on the streets. John Major's 
Government must bear some responsibility for this, as they ended 
benefits for 16- and 17-year-olds." 
  However, Sir Rhodes Boyson, the Tory MP for Brent North, 
agreed with Mr Major. "We have a massive Welfare State costing 
80-90 billion pounds. There is no need for anyone to be 
begging." 
  Mr Peter Bottomley, Tory MP for Eltham, said that in central 
London yesterday he bought a meal for someone who was begging 
for food. 
  "His pockets were full of cash. I bought him a hamburger, a 
coke and chips but he had more money on him than I did. There 
are many reasons why people beg but there is no justification 
for it." 
  Mr Richard Lloyd of Shelter, the charity for the homeless, 
condemned the Prime Minister's strictures. "For the majority on 
the streets life is tough enough, never mind being harassed by 
the police as well, as Mr Major suggests," he said. 
  Mr Major's remarks follow an interview he gave to the German 
magazine DER SPIEGEL last month in which he said many of 
London's homeless "chose to live" in such circumstances. He 
pointed to the fact that there were empty places in 
accommodation units across London and in other areas where 
people could go "if they wished."

<F P=106> [Michael Bond article: "Poisonous Trail of the Toxic </F>
Cowboys"] 
  [Text] One day at the end of last summer a small container 
ship edged quietly out of Tilbury docks in Britain and headed 
across the Atlantic for South America. Its decks were laden 
with dozens of metal barrels filled with 300 tonnes of what the 
labels innocently referred to as agricultural nutrients for soil 
treatment. 
  But when Customs officers inspected the ship as it docked in 
Brazil they discovered that the barrels were packed full, not of 
harmless fertilisers but of highly toxic chemicals such as lead, 
mercury, cadmium and arsenic. 
  Fearing that this cargo with its cancer-causing ingredients 
would end up, like dozens before it, dumped in a secluded spot 
in the Brazilian countryside, the officers refused to allow it 
ashore. The freighter, its cover blown, was forced to chug back 
to Britain fully laden. 
  Such shipments have always been unwelcome, and often 
clandestine, but no one knew for certain that they were illegal. 
Companies could export toxic waste for "recycling," but there 
was no effective check on whether the destination countries had 
necessary facilities. 
  But in March this year an attempt was made to close the 
loophole. The 127 signatories to the 1989 Basel Convention 
outlawed the dumping of any toxic waste by the industrialised 
nations on their most regular victims -- non-members of the 
Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 
the developing world like Brazil and Indonesia. But in view of 
the time it takes to build waste-disposal plants, the new rules 
do not take effect until 1997. 
  Police are now concerned that the threat of tighter 
regulations will tempt companies to find cheaper, illegal ways 
of disposing of their waste. Indeed, the loudest applause for 
the new ruling will have come from organised criminal groups, 
some of which are already being paid vast sums of money by 
European and U.S. companies to dispose of their waste overseas. 
The ban opens up whole new areas of profitable operations for 
the smugglers of poison. 
  The accepted safe methods of disposal -- incineration or 
burying in specially sealed containers -- are complex and, at 
$400 a tonne, expensive. Denied the opportunity to dispose 
legally and easily of their material, companies will be more 
prone to enlist the aid of gangs to do the job. 
  Jim Puckett of Greenpeace in Amsterdam, said: "The ban will 
succeed in closing most of the legal loopholes, but the illegal 
waste trade will become immensely profitable. The cost of 
disposing of waste in Europe by legal methods has sky-rocketed, 
and it will be easy for a firm to pay criminals a few dollars a 
barrel to get around it." 
  It is already profitable enough for organisations like the 
Mafia to have moved in. A company based in northern Italy, with 
confirmed Mafia connections, was paid by several Italian firms 
to get rid of huge quantities of toxic waste. A large part of 
it was dumped in Somalia, the rest in Vietnam and Cambodia. 
According to one investigator on the case: "The company signed 
contracts with waste producers to get rid of the stuff. When it 
was prevented from dumping all of it in Somalia, it had to find 
other places. But international contacts are no problem for 
these people." The firm's boss has since fled abroad. 
  The German Federal Criminal Bureau (BEA) is looking into 
dozens of cases in which criminal gangs are suspected of taking 
waste from industrial firms and dumping it in lakes and quarries 
in East Europe, which will be paying the price for decades to 
come. Children searching smouldering dumps for anything they can 
sell -- a common sight from Romania to the Philippines -- have 
no way of knowing that their health is being destroyed by the 
detritus of an Essen factory. 
  Every year thousands of tonnes of waste containing 
incinerator ash, old car batteries, tyres, solvents, paints, 
out-of-date pesticides and toxic heavy metals are dumped in such 
countries. 
  Germany, the world's largest exporter of toxic waste, sent 
1,370,892 tonnes of toxic waste and other hazardous rubbish to 
non-OECD countries between 1989 and 1993. Some of this was 
legally exported, under the old rules, for "recycling" to 
Indonesia and East Europe, but much was shipped in under false 
labels or simply dumped by unscrupulous German waste operators. 
  Romania, Albania, Poland, and the former Soviet Union are 
the 
most popular dumping grounds. In 1992, 500 tonnes of 
out-of-date pesticides from East Germany were discovered near 
the town of Sibiu in Romania. 
  They had been tipped there illegally over a period of two 
years after being carried across the border labelled as 
"humanitarian aid -- for use in agriculture." 
  In March this year the German Government agreed to pay for 
the removal of 400 tonnes of old pesticides which had been sent 
to Albania by a German company in March 1992 labelled as 
"humanitarian aid." Two years after it had arrived the 
consignment was still sitting on the train in which it had 
arrived -- dubbed the "death train" by Albanian newspapers -- at 
Bajze near the border with Montenegro, and much of it was 
leaking. 
  According to John Arans, a Greenpeace investigator who 
worked 
as a detective in the Netherlands for 22 years, criminal 
networks stretching from Italy to Russia are secretly funding 
illegal waste companies in Europe. "The export of illegal waste 
is related to the drugs and arms trades" he said. "The same 
names keep coming up again and again during investigations into 
these activities." 
  Italian police also claim that the Mafia has infiltrated the 
waste industry, charging companies for taking toxic waste off 
their hands and disposing of it in quarries or even on 
roadsides. Italy produces 15 million tonnes of toxic waste each 
year but has the capacity to treat just 1.5 million tonnes 
safely. 
  Europe's waste disposal industry this week joined 
environmentalists in calling for tighter controls on movements 
of toxic waste. Dieter Vogt, of the European Association of 
Waste Disposers, said: "We have more than enough regulations on 
toxic waste, but not enough is being done to implement them. It 
is up to governments to make them stick." 
  The police are not prepared to wait. Teams of detectives are 
already being assembled to track and stop the smugglers. 
Whether they can stem the toxic tide remains to be seen.

<F P=106> ["DW"-signed report: "Raid on Leading PKK Terrorists"] </F>
  [Text] Saarbruecken -- In a search for PKK [Workers Party 
of Kurdistan] leaders, a special police unit stormed a secret 
meeting of Kurds and temporarily arrested 62 Kurds in 
Saarbruecken during the weekend. According to the federal 
public prosecutor, all 62 Kurds, except one who has been staying 
in Germany illegally, were released by Saturday [28 May] night. 
  Police had prepared the large-scale operation after being 
tipped off about the secret meeting taking place in the building 
of the Kurdish Cultural Association in Saarbruecken. Apart from 
the GSG-9 antiterrorist unit, officers of the Federal Office of 
Criminal Investigations and of Saarbruecken police were involved 
in the raid. According to the Federal Public Prosecutor, there 
was no major resistance to the operation. 
  The authority says it has been conducting investigations 
since last autumn against PKK leaders who are suspected of 
forming a terrorist association. The reason for this is a 
number of offenses committed against Turkish institutions in 
Germany in 1992, 1993, and 1994 .

<F P=106> ["hal"-signed report: "European Unemployment Sounds an </F>
Alarm Signal"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 26 May -- Speaking to journalists in Bonn, 
Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt emphasized the efforts being 
made by the Federal Government to achieve deregulation within 
the European Union [EU]. That should help to overcome the 
bureaucratic obstacles within the Union. Rexrodt wants to use a 
team of independent experts, composed of scientists, 
businessmen, and lawyers, to examine these issues. They should 
check EU provisions to establish whether companies and consumers 
are being burdened with unnecessary costs. The minister did, 
however, say that the subject was "dynamite in Europe" and would 
be rejected by Jacques Delors, the EU president. 
  Rexrodt talked about the main tasks that he envisaged when 
Germany takes over the EU presidency on 1 July. Those tasks 
included overcoming unemployment and strengthening competition. 
An unemployment figure of over 17 million in Europe sounds an 
alarm bell in Europe, said Rexrodt in Bonn. Fortunately, 
economic recovery had started in many EU member states. This 
positive development has to be secured and developed. The 
European Council action program for growth, competitiveness, and 
employment can provide a basis for this. It seemed to be 
particularly important to Rexrodt to oversee the implementation 
of this plan. It would be sensible for the European states to 
report to the Council of Minister on successes and failures. 
  In individual laender -- while considering the specific 
situation in each of them -- the issue is one of consolidating 
public budgets, developing labor market policy instruments, and 
reducing bureaucracy. Next year, the European Commission is to 
expand the number of its members from the current 17 to 21. 
  Rexrodt also said it is important to liberalize the European 
electricity and gas markets: When that happens, competitive 
distortions between member states will have to be eliminated. 
In the case of energy production, companies should experience a 
healthy degree of competition. In this respect, an EU guideline 
is necessary, one that would increase the possibilities for 
transferring gas and electricity through foreign networks and 
would result in the disappearance of the current demarcation 
agreements. There are substantial differences on this issue 
within Germany. Thus, municipal authorities want to retain their 
rights to issue exclusive permits for the supply of energy. The 
Environment Ministry feels that it has been disregarded by the 
Economics Ministry, because Rexrodt's ministry has not accorded 
sufficient attention to environmental considerations and because 
coordination between the ministries does not function. 
  Further, Rexrodt thinks it is necessary to create clear-cut 
prospects for Central and East European states. In this 
respect, Germany has a particular duty. Thus, the negotiations 
on the free trade agreements with the Baltic states should be 
concluded during the German presidency. The Commission could 
then shortly present the draft of a mandate for the conclusion 
of an agreement with those states. As far as the applications 
for membership submitted by Poland and Hungary are concerned, 
membership negotiations are conceivable only when the situation 
in those countries would permit that. In the meantime, the 
European Union will have to develop its policy of opening up 
markets by dismantling tariffs and other restrictions. Rexrodt 
does not consider the ideas that he has outlined to be "a list 
of wishes," but sees there being good prospects of real progress 
in the areas in question.

<F P=106> ["Statement by FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at a </F>
meeting of the WEU Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 9 May"] 
  [Text] The present Council of Ministers is at the end of 
its one-year Luxembourg presidency of the WEU [Western European 
Union]. I would like to express thanks to [Luxembourg] Foreign 
and Defense Minister [Jacques] Poos as well as to Ambassador 
Linster and his colleagues. 
  Since our last ministerial meeting, we have made a 
significant degree of progress in the development of the WEU. 
This afternoon, we will welcome the Central European and Baltic 
states as associate members. I am grateful to all my colleagues 
that the proposal that I and [French] Foreign Minister [Alain] 
Juppe made in the fall of last year has been taken up in such a 
constructive manner. 
  I believe that we can be very pleased with the result. If we 
are serious about admitting these states to the European Union 
[EU], then a closer linkage with the WEU should accompany 
associate membership with the EU. The creation of associate 
membership status should achieve that. 
  I believe that the incorporation of these states into 
European and transatlantic security structures should constitute 
an important contribution to the security of all of Europe. The 
possibility of participation on the part of these states in our 
security and defense policy consultations as well as future 
humanitarian and peace missions will create new fields for 
cooperation. This cooperation is simultaneously closely linked 
to an expansion of the Partnership for Peace with NATO, which is 
intended to enhance military cooperation in particular. 
  Germany is in favor of closer cooperation between the WEU 
and 
the EU. When we assume the presidency of the EU at the 
beginning of July, we want to work consistently to achieve 
further progress. At the same time, a close link with NATO will 
be increasingly important. This is the background against which 
our closer cooperation with the associate members of NATO should 
be viewed. In the future, they will be increasingly drawn into 
our consultation and decisionmaking process as well as into our 
joint operations and will thus play a comprehensive part in the 
further development of the WEU. 
  The NATO summit's clear support for the further development 
of Europe's security and defense identity with the goal of a 
common defense policy for the EU is an important basis for a 
stronger transatlantic partnership. The summit decision that 
the Europeans could use the Atlantic alliance's common 
structures and capacities for military missions within the WEU 
framework is a way of setting the course for our future 
cooperation. The implementation of the NATO concept for the 
creation of an allied command is of great significance for the 
further work of the WEU. 
  The period of expanding the WEU must now be followed by a 
period of enhancement. Our goal, which we set at Petersberg in 
1992 -- that is to say, to carry out missions to secure peace 
independently -- is still to be achieved. A significant 
improvement in cooperation at the level of armed forces 
groupings, command structures and logistics, as well as 
intelligence and infrastructure planning is necessary. This 
could be a key issue over the next few months. 
  Please allow me to say something about the WEU consultations 
about satellite-aided intelligence gathering. It is a very 
ambitious idea. We now face having to make a decision about 
whether we will cooperate beyond the study phase and go over to 
the project phase. I believe that we should essentially accept 
that challenge, because without a common European intelligence 
capacity, a common crisis-management approach can scarcely be 
realized. The projected expense, which is significant, must be 
substantiated in a way that involves no objections. 
  The WEU will soon face the next test when it becomes 
involved 
in the administration of Mostar. Over the past few months, WEU 
planning on policing has advanced considerably. If security and 
order is not maintained in Mostar, then all other measures aimed 
at reviving the city are built on sand. Should the WEU assume 
this task, it can once again demonstrate that after its 
successful participation in the implementation of the embargo in 
the Adriatic -- together with the Atlantic Alliance -- and on 
the Danube -- along with the EU -- it can make an important 
contribution to the restoration of peaceful coexistence in 
Mostar. 
  The second half of 1994 and 1995 will be overshadowed by the 
EU Government Conference schedule for 1996. That also applies 
to the WEU as a integral part of the development of a European 
security and defense identity. 
  The proposal made by the future Dutch presidency regarding 
an 
examination of the requirements of a European defense policy as 
the focus of the second half of the year has the full approval 
of Germany. When Germany holds the EU presidency, we will 
cooperate closely with the Dutch presidency to smooth the way 
with regard to the EU and WEU so that the government conference 
can open a new page on the path toward a common European 
security and defense policy.

<F P=106> ["ub/mes"-signed report: "Belgium's Head of Government </F>
Dehaene To Become New EU Commission President"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- One month before Germany takes over the 
European Union [EU] presidency, leadership problems in the EU 
seem to have been largely solved: Belgium's Prime Minister 
Jean-Luc Dehaene is to become the new president of the Brussels 
Commission, and the European affairs expert in the German 
Foreign Ministry, Juergen Trumpf, will be his secretary general. 
This line that has leaked from the Brussels Commission will be 
agreed upon at Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl's meeting with 
French President Francois Mitterrand on Monday [30 May]. In 
Friday's Bundestag session, Kohl announced that his government 
wants to use the [German EU] presidency starting on 1 July for 
making 1994 a year of success in European unification. Rudolf 
Scharping, Social Democratic Party of Germany chairman, accused 
Kohl of failures in his European policy. 
  In their consultations in Alsace, Kohl and Mitterrand will 
set the course for the European Council meeting in Greece on 24 
June. Greece has held the EU presidency since the beginning of 
this year. SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG has been informed that the 
chancellor and the president agree that Belgium's Prime Minister 
Dehaene will succeed Jacques Delors as Commission president. 
Meanwhile, 10 of the 12 EU governments are said to share this 
view. The other candidates for Commission president are Dutch 
Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and British Foreign Trade 
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan. The British candidate is not 
considered to stand much chance; the Dutch one might be slightly 
more successful. It has been said that the time has come to 
bring it home to Lubbers that he should "withdraw gracefully." 
Should Bonn and Paris succeed in making Belgium's Dehaene EU 
president, Belgium would support a German secretary general. 
State Secretary Trumpf would be available for that position. 
Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel have already agreed on 
this option. Trumpf, a longtime ambassador to the European 
Community, is a Social Democrat. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Barbara Schmid: "`Red Heidi' To Become </F>
Commissioner in Brussels"] 
  [Text] A new job for Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] politician Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul (51). As of January 
1995, she is to become a commissioner at the European Union [EU] 
in Brussels. Seventeen new commissioners will start working 
there. The previous German representatives, Martin Bangemann 
(Free Democratic Party) and Peter Schmidhuber (Christian Social 
Union), will be replaced. 
  The Christian Democratic Union and the SPD may appoint one 
commissioner each. The SPD deputies in the European Parliament, 
which must approve the appointment, want a candidate with 
European experience. Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Bundestag 
deputy and vice chairwoman of the party with the nickname "Red 
Heidi," fulfills the conditions. The SPD leadership wants to 
send the former Young Socialists chief to Brussels. She was in 
the European Parliament from 1979 to 1987 and she knows the EU 
inside out. The desired candidate is emphatically restrained: 
"I have not yet been asked. The decision will be made by 
Rudolf Scharping alone." In Bonn, she would have liked to 
become minister of European affairs. However, if Rudolf 
Scharping wins the elections, he wants to reduce the government; 
Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul would then be left with the post of 
state secretary. As EU commissioner, she can achieve more, and 
the salary is not bad either: about 28,000 marks per month. 
Finance expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier and Kiel's European 
Affairs Minister Gerd Walter do not stand a chance of being 
appointed.

<F P=106> [Klaus Rost report: "Critical Toward Europe -- But No </F>
Stubborn Opposition"] 
  [Text] Europe is going to vote -- and, for the first time, 
the east Germans are permitted to participate. Shortly before 
12 June, only 42 percent of the east Germans are certain that 
they will participate in the election. They reject the 
political union under a common European government and the 
European Currency Unit. They would welcome a common foreign and 
security policy. The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] is moving 
up slightly in the new laender. Today, we are publishing data 
gained by Infratest Burke Berlin in a fourth poll exclusively 
for NEUE ZEIT. 
  -- Which party do you like best at the moment? 
  In May 1994, the CDU was able to catch up a bit with its 
main 
competitor in eastern Germany. Even though the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] still has the highest 
popularity value with 24 percent, the CDU is catching up: In 
May, its share rose to 20 percent, following 16 percent in April. 
  Obviously, the CDU is increasingly managing to regain 
voters, 
who had distanced themselves from the CDU without finding a 
lasting one in any other party. In view of the slightly more 
positive signals from the economy, more than just a few are 
turning back to the chancellor's party. The CDU is benefiting 
most strongly from the shrinking of that group of undecided 
people who do not like any party. Their proportion declined 
from 37 percent in February to 32 percent now -- a difference 
that corresponds rather closely to the gains of the CDU (+ 6 
percent). 
  The CDU particularly gained in popularity in Saxony-Anhalt 
and in Thuringia. However, in Berlin and in Brandenburg, too, it 
gained popularity over the past month -- in Brandenburg for the 
first time to the detriment of the ruling SPD. Alliance 
90/Greens were able to improve their standing (to 10 percent), 
the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] went down a bit (8 
percent). The Free Democratic Party [FDP] is still among the 
splinter parties regarding its popularity. These figures, 
however, just reflect the current mood in the new laender, but 
they do not permit any deductions as to the real behavior of the 
people at the Bundestag election in October 1994. 
  -- How do you assess the work of your land government? 
  Compared with other east German laender, the Saxon Land 
government gets the best marks from its own people: 58 percent 
of those polled are satisfied with its work; in February this 
was true for 55 percent. It has thus overtaken the Brandenburg 
government, which has lost in approval and gets 50 percent. 
  Minister-President Manfred Stolpe's team is thus the only 
one 
among the land governments that has had to accept tangible 
losses. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Thuringia, Berlin, and 
Saxony-Anhalt got worse marks, but they were able to gain 
considerably in approval. The greatest leap was achieved by the 
grand coalition in Berlin: Following a 21-percent approval in 
February, now 37 percent of Berliners are satisfied with the 
Senat's work. The proportion of dissatisfied people is, 
however, still considerably higher in all laender with the 
exception of Saxony and Brandenburg. The bottom place on the 
list is still occupied by the government in Saxony-Anhalt, even 
though the potential effects of the Magdeburg riots on Ascension 
Day have not yet been taken into consideration in this study. 
  -- Which politicians have convinced you most? 
  Like his party as a whole, the current Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl 
has also managed to catch up a bit. From April to May, the 
proportion of those who find his policy convincing rose from 25 
to 29 percent. His distance from challenger Scharping is thus 1 
percentage point. At the beginning of the year he was still 12 
points behind Scharping. Negative assessments are still 
dominant for both of them. A total of 52 percent think that 
Scharping's work is not convincing, as many as 65 percent think 
the same of Kohl's performance. However, the proportion of 
those who are unable to assess the SPD candidate -- 19 percent 
-- is clearly higher than for Kohl (6 percent). 
  All other federal politicians of the various parties 
presented for assessment also show a negative balance sheet. 
Theo Waigel gets the worst marks. Only in the case of Rita 
Suessmuth, followed by Norbert Bluem, are positive and negative 
assessments approximately balanced. Of the federal politicians 
in the new laender, Angela Merkel was able to improve a bit. 
Gregor Gysi, on the other hand, lost 5 percentage points. 
  In the new laender, the SPD continues to benefit from the 
leading team in Brandenburg; Regine Hildebrandt and Manfred 
Stolpe. However, Stolpe's power of conviction has obviously 
suffered as a result of the break of the SPD-FDP-Greens 
coalition in Brandenburg. In May, for the first time, negative 
marks for him dominate. In his own land he lost most with 7 
percent, but he still need not worry too much with the remaining 
70 percent of approval. Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen can show 
a balanced result: 47 percent of the Berliners find him 
convincing, 48 percent do not. Bernhard Vogel in Thuringia and 
Berndt Seite in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania were able to gain 
a bit, but, just as in the case of Saxony-Anhalt Minister 
President Christoph Bergner, negative assessments for them 
clearly dominate. 
  -- Which party represents German interests in the European 
Union [EU] best? 
  The parties still have a lot to do. Asked which party seems 
to be best suited to represent Germany's interest in the 
European Parliament, one out of four east Germans (24 percent) 
are still unable to name a party. Almost one in 10 (8 percent) 
thinks that none of the parties running for election are able to 
do that. Characteristically, among them there is an 
above-average number of European skeptics who do not find their 
distance to the EU in the election program of the established 
parties on European policy and, at the same time, think that one 
cannot vote for parties with an expressly anti-European program 
-- such as the Republikaner. 
  So far, the SPD seems to be the most convincing party. A 
total of 28 percent of those polled think that it is best suited 
to represent German interests in Strasbourg, followed by the CDU 
with 25 percent, Alliance 90/Greens (5 percent), and PDS (4 
percent). Also, with a view to European policy, the FDP's loss 
in trust is dramatic. It is just getting 2 percent. 
  -- Does Germany's membership in the EU bring advantages or 
disadvantages? 
  When the east Germans automatically gained membership in the 
EU in the course of unification at the end of 1990, they 
welcomed this almost unanimously. After four years of 
membership, approval of European unification is undamaged, but 
the assessment is now more differentiated. Only 16 percent are 
now of the view that EU membership is primarily linked with 
advantages. About half of those polled think that advantages 
and disadvantages are balanced. As many as one-third (34 
percent) are convinced that membership rather gives rise to 
disadvantages. 
  Particularly skeptical toward Europe are middle-aged and 
older people as well as people with lower education. Younger 
people, as well as secondary school or university graduates, on 
the other hand, primarily believe that EU membership is linked 
with advantages. 
  -- Will you participate in the 1994 European elections? 
  On 12 June the east Germans are, for the first time, called 
upon to elect their representatives for the European Parliament. 
At the time of the poll -- one month before the election -- 42 
percent were determined to "certainly" participate in the first 
all-German European election. They are opposed by 20 percent, 
who will "probably not" or "certainly not" participate. It will 
depend on the hot election campaign period of the next few weeks 
whether the parties will manage to lure as many of the 38 
percent, who are at least considering participation, as possible 
to the ballot booths. If they manage to persuade only half of 
them, the turnout of 62.3 percent, which was achieved in the old 
laender in 1989, will not be reached in the new laender. 
  In view of this still open readiness to vote, one cannot 
make 
any predictions. For instance, the CDU has so far seemed to be 
slightly better able to persuade their potential voters, because 
in the group of those who are determined to vote, the CDU leads 
with about 33 percent, in front of the SPD with 30 percent. How 
difficult the decision is for not just a few east Germans is 
clearly shown by the fact that almost one out of four of those 
who are determined to vote is unable to cite a party as the 
representatives of his interests in the European Parliament. 
  -- How do you assess the goals and tasks of the EU? 
  The skepticism of the east German population is concentrated 
particularly on two goals: One-third each reject the 
establishment of a political union with a common European 
government and the introduction of a unified European currency. 
In rejecting an all-European government, in addition to the 
fear of long national independence, there might also be the fear 
that part of the transparency of political decisions and of the 
possibilities of democratic control, which had been gained after 
the upheaval, might be lost. 
  The clear rejection of the ECU as a common European currency 
is primarily the expression of trust in the stable German mark, 
which both west and east Germans do not want to give up. The 
agricultural policy of the EU is also assessed very critically. 
About 60 percent reject setting down limited production amounts. 
  The widespread skepticism regarding certain goals of the EU 
in the new laender is, however, not to be equaled with a general 
rejection of the EU. Thus, for instance, unified guidelines for 
consumer protection are welcomed by 86 percent of those polled. 
As many as three-quarters of the east Germans want a EU that 
acts more cohesively toward the outside than it is doing now: 
They advocate implementing a common foreign policy. Almost 
three-fifths of those polled agree with the establishment of a 
European defense community. 
  If the majority of the east German people had their say, the 
expansion of the EU toward East Europe would be part of the 
common European foreign and security policy. A total of 55 
percent would welcome the acceptance of East European states; 44 
percent, on the other hand, reject this, including primarily 
older people as well as the people in Brandenburg, which has a 
long border with Poland.

<F P=106> ["C.G."-signed report: "Kinkel: CSCE Not To Be Put Above </F>
NATO"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn, 27 May -- Following Russian Defense 
Minister Grachev's statements in Brussels, the Federal 
Government has pointed out the limits of the West's concessions 
to Moscow. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Friday [27 
May]: "Russia's wish to put the CSCE above other European 
security institutions is not shared by us." He said that 
although the CSCE is of great importance, "there cannot be" a 
ranking, with the CSCE coming first, the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council second, followed by NATO in third place. 
Moscow cannot be granted a right of veto either. Kinkel said: 
"Security in Europe cannot dispense with NATO as a defense 
alliance in the foreseeable future." This is also in the 
interest of the Central and East Europe states, Kinkel said. 
  However, Kinkel welcomed Russia's willingness to accept 
NATO's offer to join the Partnership for Peace program. It is 
important that Russia wants to join the program as an equal 
partner. The partnership opens up the opportunity for 
comprehensive military cooperation to secure peace and stability 
in Europe. Like the other partners, Russia can itself decide on 
the extent and quality of its contributions. Kinkel said: "I 
expect Russia to sign the Partnership for Peace framework 
document as soon as possible." In addition, talks and 
cooperation between NATO and Russia are desirable: "NATO and 
nuclear power Russia have to enter into a strategic dialogue, 
such as the one that the United States and Russia have had for 
years." Mutual consultations, although excluding a Russian 
right of veto, are in the interest of all parties concerned, 
Kinkel said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Hugo </F>
Mueller-Vogg and Cornelia von Wrangel; place and date not given: 
"If Herzog Fails, It Would Not Be a Defeat for Kohl"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE 
SONNTAGSZEITUNG] Your party is dangerously close to 5 percent. 
  [Kinkel] We have clearly improved In the latest polls. The 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] is improving and we will also 
continue to improve. When we have our next interview together, 
we will be considerably higher in the polls. I promise you 
that. We will conduct a massive second-vote campaign until the 
Bundestag elections and we will specifically address those who 
perform most in our society. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] But in the election 
program you are shying away from using the term party of 
high-wage earners. 
  [Kinkel] Yes, the term high-wage earner is not an invention 
of the Free Democratic Party [FDP], but a class-struggle term of 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. The term 
high-wage earner was easy to misinterpret, but the basic 
approach remains correct: Equal starting opportunities for 
everyone, then let those who are better, more dedicated, more 
intelligent, more inclined toward risks, more willing to 
perform, and more capable of performance take the lead. They 
must fill the baskets from which things can then be distributed 
to the socially weaker people. We will clearly say that those 
who do more should be and may also be better off. No social 
envy, please! Without performance, without performance elites 
in all fields, Germany will not remain competitive. Therefore, 
the FDP will embrace this. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] Can the high-wage 
earners rely on you to struggle for a limitation of the 
solidarity surcharge in terms of time? 
  [Kinkel] Certainly. It remains true: After three years, 
the solidarity surcharge must be reexamined with the goal of 
abolishing it as soon as possible, in steps if necessary. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] Two years ago, you 
were categorically against any amendment to the asylum law. In 
the meantime, the asylum law has been amended. 
  [Kinkel] This was very difficult formerly. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] After the event, 
would you still say that this amendment was a mistake? 
  [Kinkel] The dimension of immigration has steamrolled us. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] And if you look at 
the result now? 
  [Kinkel] In any case, the result is such that one can say 
that the amendment was probably correct. I am not someone who 
shies away from saying that he can be convinced by better 
reasons or results. However, my approach was different: Not too 
long ago, millions of people had to leave Germany to save their 
lives and ask for asylum in other countries. I was and am proud 
of our liberal aliens' law. I was and am proud of our Article 
16. However, what I wanted to hold high was undermined by the 
dimension of the requests for asylum. This was the reason for me 
to politically support the amendment to Article 16. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] The laender ruled 
by the SPD are in favor of temporarily stopping the deportations 
of Kurds. With this, they suggest that Kurds are persecuted 
everywhere in Turkey. Our question to the foreign minister: 
Does this strain German-Turkish relations? 
  [Kinkel] We have had friendly relations with Turkey, an 
important NATO partner, for decades. After overcoming the 
East-West conflict, this country has become even more important 
as a bridge to the Islamic world and to Asia. For Turkey, the 
Kurdish issue is a gigantic problem. I always tell my Turkish 
interlocutors that naturally they must fight the PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan], but exclusively with the means of a 
rule-of-law state. I always say that human rights violations 
cannot be accepted. I cannot and do not want to comment on the 
decisions of the interior ministers. However, as foreign 
minister, I have to keep an eye on the overall situation. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] Hesse 
Minister-President Eichel has criticized you, saying that the 
Foreign Ministry's reports about the observation of human rights 
in Turkey are unreliable. 
  [Kinkel] I do not know whether Mr. Eichel is, first, 
properly informed and, second, the expert for these questions. 
I would slightly doubt that. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] He will not like to 
hear that.... 
  [Kinkel] ...but I maintain that. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] How can the 
government of our NATO partner, Turkey, prove that the 
persecution of the Kurds is not ordered and condoned by the 
state? 
  [Kinkel] I advise Turkey to ask for CSCE observers itself to 
refute everything that is claimed. This is not very easy for 
Turkey. Nor is it easy that I keep broaching the issue of human 
rights. But the Turks know that I am doing all this out of a 
friendly feeling for Turkey and that I want to help the country. 
Ankara knows my attitude toward Turkey, which has remained the 
same in the good days and in the bad days. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] Let us stay with 
foreign policy. The West fought the Gulf war to bring the 
"legitimate regime" in Kuwait back to power. In Bosnia the West 
is hardly fighting, and Rwanda is of no interest at all. 
  [Kinkel] This is not correct, in this way. In the former 
Yugoslavia we have achieved some progress: Sarajevo, Gorazde, 
in the safe havens, in Krajina, in Mostar. A definite solution 
is not yet in sight, despite all the effort. And in Rwanda, 
too, help is provided. A total of 5,000 blue-helmet soldiers 
are to go there; humanitarian aid is under way. The Bundeswehr 
will fly relief goods to Kigali as soon as the security 
situation permits and the conflict parties agree. However, it 
is correct that the media, for instance, with their 
supercritical reports about the terrible conflicts in the former 
Yugoslavia, about the UN mission in Somalia, and about some 
other missions, are contributing to making all governments very 
restrained regarding the issue of involvement, now in Rwanda for 
instance. In Somalia there were some failures. Yes, the UN 
Somalia mission did not go as we all wanted it to go. However, 
thanks to the UN mission, we at least defeated hunger there. 
Nevertheless, everything was presented as a failure in the 
media. Is it surprising that the governments are restrained 
about Rwanda, even though a terrible genocide is happening 
there? In addition, it is extremely difficult to help from the 
outside in such a conflict. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] Should we not at 
least provide humanitarian aid there? 
  [Kinkel] We are going to do that. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] In three weeks, we 
will have European elections. How credible is the European idea 
if one thinks of the Europeans' failure in the former Yugoslavia 
and of the Germans' narrow-minded reservations against the 
Maastricht Treaty? 
  First of all, Europe was an economic community of six. Now 
there are 12. Soon there will be 16 sitting at the table. 
Unfortunately, the development of a common foreign and security 
policy did not keep pace with economic integration. There is no 
doubt: So far, we have not found any solution for the conflict 
in the former Yugoslavia. However, one must also see that we are 
certainly making progress. But it would be wrong to throw the 
baby out with the bathwater and to say that there is no point in 
striving for a common foreign and security policy. On the 
contrary: This is urgently necessary, because without the 
European Union not even what we have achieved would have been 
possible. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] And what about 
Maastricht and the common currency? 
  [Kinkel] For me the observation of the criteria for 
convergence is of absolute priority. Compared with that, the 
envisaged schedule is secondary. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] How dangerous, do 
you think, is the former Bavarian FDP chairman and his 
anti-Europe party? 
  [Kinkel] Like a may-fly.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Erich Honecker, the former GDR 
head of state, is dead. One of the most powerful men in the GDR 
died of cancer today at age 81 in his Chilean exile, Santiago de 
Chile. 
  The news of the death of the man who had been ill for a long 
time has "come as no great surprise," government spokesman 
Dieter Vogel said in an initial statement. Honecker failed in 
his political objectives. His policy meant suffering for 
innumerable people in Germany. However, respect for the dead 
makes it appropriate "to say but little" at this particular 
moment about his role in the German postwar period.

<F P=106> [Interview with President-Elect Roman Herzog by Manfred </F>
Bissinger and Hans-Ulrich Joerges; place and date not given: 
"The Inconvenient President"] 
  [Text] [DIE WOCHE] Mr. President, what slogan have you 
adopted for your mandate? What is your most important objective 
now? 
  [Herzog] I am chiefly concerned with truth and clarity. The 
four parties that support our democracy are all based on the 
values of the French revolution, in other words liberty, 
equality, and fraternity. These values must be brought to the 
fore again. Now and again there have to be people who raise 
their voices above daily political conflicts and warn others 
that our democracy is still fragile . 
  [DIE WOCHE] In other words the president must pull 
everything 
together. Must he also express criticism now and again? 
  [Herzog] He should do both. First, he must emphasize those 
qualities that bring people together. His task is also to 
recognize long-term problems and developments that do not 
necessarily dominate the political debates. We have parliaments 
that have become nothing more than legislative machines because 
we expect too much from them. We have parties that contain 
various factions that have to be integrated all the time. And 
we also have some very insensitive media and associations. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Truth and clarity -- does that mean a readiness 
to criticize others, especially pressure groups? Is that your 
idea? 
  [Herzog] That is not my intention, but it is inevitable. 
That has always been my conviction. 
  [DIE WOCHE] How would you describe yourself? Are you an 
enlightened conservative, a conservative of values, or a classic 
conservative? 
  [Herzog] Of course I am conservative in certain points. 
Above all, I want to preserve our political system. Our system 
is a progressive one in many spheres, and therefore I am 
progressive as well. But playing about with definitions serves 
no purpose. I am fond of hearing the adjective "enlightened," 
because for me it means thinking without any taboos. 
  [DIE WOCHE] You were born in Landshut. What memories do you 
have of your family home and the community you grew up in? 
  [Herzog] My father held a leading position in a snuff 
factory. This company played a major role in Landshut, which 
was not particularly well endowed with industry. I remember 
that we lived close to the factory, and I was able to draw an 
outline of the whole factory. That, by the way, is also one of 
the reasons why I sometimes say that I grew up among workers. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Was your childhood milieu a lower-middle-class 
one? 
  [Herzog] There was certainly a trend upwards from the lower 
middle class. My father came from a clearly lower-middle-class 
home in which music was very popular. He was capable of reading 
music scores, and he was a wonderful amateur violinist. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Do you have any brothers and sisters? 
  [Herzog] I have a brother who is three years younger. He is 
a 
nuclear physicist, responsible for the security of one of the 
nuclear reactors near Landshut. By the way, he is more musical 
than me. He plays the piano. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Who had more influence on your upbringing? Did 
your father let you mother do all the work? 
  [Herzog] Of course he was concerned about my upbringing, but 
my mother had to wage the daily family struggle. My father had 
certain guidelines about his children's upbringing. Of course 
he never let my mother decide on her own, which she would never 
have liked to do in any case, because deep inside she was 
somewhat insecure. She was enormously hard-working and 
efficient, but she always paid attention to the opinions of 
others. If I had to describe in a nutshell the upbringing I 
received for my father, I would say that he created room for 
development. But all the same, he set an example to me with his 
strictness and with his method of separating the tangible from 
the intangible. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Did he ever say you must grow up to be a man? 
  [Herzog] He said to us: I am giving you a better chance than 
my father ever gave me, and you must make the most of it. 
  [DIE WOCHE] What did you father think of National Socialism? 
Was there a difference of opinion between home and school? 
  [Herzog] The firm for which my father worked belonged to a 
family in which one of the leading members was a convinced 
National Socialist. One day, before 1933, this person simply 
registered all the factory employees in the National Socialist 
Party [NSDAP]. He said that the party needed more people and 
that he himself would pay the membership dues. The employees 
accepted. The first genuine political memory I have is of 1938, 
the year Austria was annexed to Germany. 
  [DIE WOCHE] You remember the celebrations? 
  [Herzog] Exactly. Then my father said my mother: "Go and 
turn the radio off. The Austrians must be kidding. Surely they 
must know what is happening in Germany." 
  [DIE WOCHE] What did he mean? 
  [Herzog] He meant the lost freedom of speech, and he also 
meant the proletarian, loud-mouthed public appearances that he 
had always abhorred, not only in the NSDAP. 
  [DIE WOCHE] What political values did he give you then? 
  [Herzog] Of course we discussed the political situation, 
especially during the first years of the war when he was still 
at home. But he was more concerned about the military and world 
political situation, such as relations between France and 
England. Whenever we listened to some loud speech, he would 
adopt an odd expression, and his nose would become quite narrow. 
An attempt was once made to get me into an Adolf Hitler School. 
He must have been at home on leave at the time. I came home 
full of joy at the idea of going to such a school, but the idea 
was soon given up. "I am going to bring my children up myself," 
said my father. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Did the word "Dachau" mean anything in your 
home, 
school, or milieu? 
  [Herzog] We knew about Dachau, but we had never heard of the 
expression concentration camp. All we used to say was: Look, 
there's a man being taken away. He is going to Dachau. 
  [DIE WOCHE] What ideas did the word Dachau call up? 
  [Herzog] The general impression in my environment was that 
Dachau was a place where people had to work very hard. I can 
specify the exact date we discovered what a concentration camp 
really was. It was 30 December 1944. The Landshut railroad 
station was bombed for the first time on 28 December. On 30 
December, we saw for the first time a column of 50 or 60 
concentration camp prisoners who had been detailed to clear the 
wreckage. For me, and I am sure for my father as well, because 
I can still see his face, that was the first concrete impression 
of what things were really like in Dachau. My mother began to 
complain loudly, not about the condition of the prisoners, but 
about their thin clothing. Later, in the beginning or middle of 
April 1945, thousands of prisoners from some concentration camp 
were led through Landshut. Then one could clearly see what was 
happening. That is a great memory for me, almost a traumatic 
one, and it has affected my entire political thinking. 
  [DIE WOCHE] You went to an arts high school? 
  [Herzog] Yes, in Landshut. It was run mainly by pensioners, 
so we did not experience much National Socialism in it. The 
principal was a former member of the Bavarian People's Party, 
who was not particularly concerned about anything. So we did not 
have much to do with National Socialism. We kept changing 
schools, but from March 1945 on there was virtually no more 
education. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Then the chaotic years began. 
  [Herzog] I did not resume high school until October 1946. 
Actually, I should have have gone back to elementary school, but 
for some reason the authorities overlooked me in the general 
mess. The 14 or 15 months without school were the best part of 
my youth. It was a time of freedom the likes of which it is 
impossible to imagine! I was 11 at the time, my brother eight. 
We spent the whole of the hot summer of 1948 on the Isar River. 
  [DIE WOCHE] When did you become interested in politics? 
  [Herzog] Pretty early. It sounds funny, but we learned East 
European geography from Wehrmacht reports. Two images in my 
life made a political impression on me -- first, the 
concentration camp inmates in Landshut, and second, the stream 
of refugees from the East. 
  [DIE WOCHE] When did you choose which political stream to 
follow? 
  [Herzog] My first conscious postwar experience was the 
debate 
on rearmament. I was clearly in favor of rearmament, even 
though I knew it might mean military service for me. In the 
meantime, the GDR uprising occurred on 17 June 1953. We learned 
a lesson from that. The lesson was that one must defend 
oneself. I decided to join the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
quite late, during my time as professor in Berlin. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Let us return to the graduation exams. You were 
top of your class? 
  [Herzog] Yes. 
  [DIE WOCHE] What grade did you get? 
  [Herzog] One. It all came to me automatically. I never had 
to work as a schoolboy. I also had tolerant teachers. For at 
least two years, I never had any school exercise books, because 
in the afternoons I used to provide additional instruction, and 
in the evening I used to wander off to the city center, where I 
met my wife. 
  [DIE WOCHE] You used to chase women? 
  [Herzog] Of course. And they chased us. We were very 
good-looking boys. 
  [DIE WOCHE] What was the young Roman Herzog like? Were you 
popular even though you were brainy? 
  [Herzog] I was always a spokesman for the class. In the 
final three years, I was even a spokesman for the school. 
  [DIE WOCHE] How old were you when you met your wife? 
  [Herzog] Her family came to Landshut in 1948. I was 14 and 
my future wife 11. We met in the local cafe. Landshut had a 
population of between 30,000 and 40,000. Everyone knew everyone 
else, and one knew attractive women in particular. 
  [DIE WOCHE] This was your first love? 
  [Herzog] Yes. 
  [DIE WOCHE] You never joined the Bundeswehr? 
  [Herzog] No. The rearmament debate dragged on so long that I 
ceased to be eligible. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Why did you study law? 
  [Herzog] I wanted to study law. But already in school I 
realized that law was not going to be my career. Nevertheless I 
did not give up studying law. Later, I fluctuated between law 
and physics. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Physics was the science of the future. 
  [Herzog] It was interesting, especially because one could 
read the treatises of Einstein and Heisenberg. However, I must 
say that my opinion of Einstein was not quite unblemished 
because Einstein condoned the construction of the atom bomb. 
  [DIE WOCHE] How did you reach your opinion regarding the 
atom 
bomb? 
  [Herzog] The first time I read about Hiroshima was during a 
summer vacation with my relatives in the country. It must have 
been 1947. The author of the report I read was Hans Have. I 
knew of course that the bomb was first of all a war atrocity, 
and second it was a dirty business. But during the 
confrontation with the East bloc I was always in favor of 
nuclear weapons on the assumption that they would never be used. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Did you ever support the idea of nuclear weapons 
for the Bundeswehr? 
  [Herzog] Never. The ban on these weapons was already 
declared in 1954. 
  [DIE WOCHE] What effect did Konrad Adenauer and Kurt 
Schumacher have on you? 
  [Herzog] Adenauer's political efforts were very much 
respected in my family. But we preferred Schumacher's speeches. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Schumacher was more nationalist? 
  [Herzog] True, but he was also clearer. He represented 
German interests more clearly. 
  [DIE WOCHE] What was your first impression of the wild 
young Franz Jozef Strauss? Did you observe his struggle against 
the Bavarian party? 
  [Herzog] The Bavarian Party had certain anti-foreigner 
undertones, directed against refugees and displaced persons. 
But there is an old anticlerical tradition in Bavaria that is 
nevertheless a conservative one. The Bavarian Party supported 
this tradition. It was obvious that one day someone would 
appear who is a liberal and flexible enough to lead the two 
conservative streams, the clerical Hundhammer-Christian Social 
Union, and the anticlerical Bavarian Party. That someone was 
Franz Josef Strauss. 
  [DIE WOCHE] You met Theodor Maunz at Munich University. 
Professionally, and probably politically as well, he was an 
important person for you for a longer period of time. What kind 
of relationship did you have? 
  [Herzog] I never felt the need to establish a personal 
relationship with a professor. But when I took my preliminary 
exams in 1957, I decided that I must take my final exams with 
him. 
  [DIE WOCHE] And did you also achieve an A in these 
examinations? 
  [Herzog] No, but the grade was quite high nevertheless, to 
my 
great surprise. When I became his assistant, he was already 
culture minister. I never served directly under him. The only 
things I wrote for him were commentaries on the Basic Law. These 
were patterns that he later revamped, usually for the worse. It 
was clear that I would earn my final qualifications from him so 
I undertook to write a legal commentary. 
  [DIE WOCHE] It is you who wrote the Basic Law commentary? 
  [Herzog] I would not say that. But there are major passages 
that I did write, which were later published under Maunz's name. 
  [DIE WOCHE] How much of it did you write? 
  [Herzog] I would say 40 percent. 
  [DIE WOCHE] How do you explain the later secret activity of 
Gerhard Frey, chief of the right-wing extremist German People's 
Union? 
  [Herzog] Maunz was not a Nazi. His son kept making that 
clear. He reached a compromise under the Third Reich. He was 
much too Catholic to be a Hitler-Nazi. I have never heard 
anything about him that sounds antidemocratic. Needless to say 
he must have maintained close contacts. In the 1980's, I was 
secretary of state in Bonn; so I do not know what happened, but 
I imagine that whatever it was, it was similar to the situation 
of a politician who, years after people have lost interest in 
him, is happy to be asked for any advice at all. 
  [DIE WOCHE] What was your reaction when you heard this? 
  [Herzog] I was extremely annoyed. It is understandable for 
people to have been suppliant under the Third Reich. One should 
avoid making hasty judgments if one has never been in such a 
situation. But the business with Frey was completely 
unnecessary. It is inexplicable. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Then you became an ordinary professor. You began 
to take a more active part in events. You experienced the 1968 
disturbances in Berlin, the death of Benno Ohnesorg, the visit 
of the Shah, the Socialist German Students Union, the 
anti-Springer campaign, and so on. 
  [Herzog] That was insignificant. 
  [DIE WOCHE] But it was a very exciting period. 
  [Herzog] Yes and no. For some professors and also students, 
it was partly a cowboys-and-Indians game left over from one's 
youth. What the people of 1968 wanted, those who were not 
Marxist apparatchiks, was the same as what we wanted. But that 
did not make a real impression on me. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Willy Brandt was foreign minister at that time, 
then he became chancellor. It is said that one of his great 
achievements was to have integrated a large part of these unruly 
young people into the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]. 
How did you see this at that time? 
  [Herzog] I did not really understand it at that time. 
According to my view then, the SPD made too many bows to these 
young people. Today, however, I see things a bit differently. 
I think it was an achievement by Willy Brandt that he 
safeguarded the left end of our political spectrum for many 
years, just as Franz Josef Strauss did on the right. There is a 
gap left by the two 
  [DIE WOCHE] Then you went from Berlin to Speyer. Did you 
come into contact with Helmut Kohl there? You entered the CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union] in 1970. 
  [Herzog] This was done independently of each other. I met 
Kohl in 1972. The issue was the land representation of the 
Rhineland-Palatinate CDU in Bonn. Kohl described the office to 
me, said that he would now probably also enter federal politics, 
and asked me whether I would be interested. 
  [DIE WOCHE] He did not ask you about your basic political 
principles? 
  [Herzog] No. 
  [DIE WOCHE] He did not ask: Mr. Herzog, what are your 
values? 
  [Herzog] No. This was not discussed at all, nor was party 
membership. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Then you were one of Kohl's closest advisers. 
  [Herzog] This is not quite correct. It was a habit that, 
before the Cabinet meetings, a small circle went to the minister 
president's room to discuss a few things there. One cannot call 
this advisory work, but, of course, a lot of things were 
discussed. 
  [DIE WOCHE] You were part of Kohl's inner circle. 
  [Herzog] Yes, one can say that. 
  [DIE WOCHE] During your time in Mainz, did a friendship with 
Kohl develop that went beyond these circles? 
  [Herzog] Yes, there is a certain affinity. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Is belief important for you? Do you pray? 
  [Herzog] Basically to thank God. 
  [DIE WOCHE] In church? 
  [Herzog] At home. I do not attend church regularly. Often, 
the sermons are too political. 
  [DIE WOCHE] How does Mr. Herzog live as a private person? 
  [Herzog] The problem is that life is shrinking more and 
more. 
For the time being, I can only talk about my life so far, I 
cannot yet see what the new life as president will be like. For 
me it is a joy when I am at home on the weekend and can do my 
work in peace and quiet. Working four or five hours per day 
without having the telephone ring, that is it. And I like to 
smoke cigarillos while doing my work. I no longer have a good 
wine cellar since I moved from Heidelberg to Bonn. But today I 
practically do not drink any alcohol anymore, because of the 
calories. 
  [DIE WOCHE] To what extent were you able to get involved in 
your son's education? 
  [Herzog] My children were basically brought up by their 
mother. But I have never been shielded against any problem, but 
I sometimes said: Hey, that is impossible. For instance, I 
always said that my children can get only a limited amount of 
pocket money, but they have the opportunity to earn money in 
addition. Or I am very much willing to participate in buying a 
car, but I will not give one penny for a motorcycle. 
  [DIE WOCHE] What are your sons doing by way of profession? 
  [Herzog] The elder one is a physicist. I advised them 
against a legal career, because it is bad when the father has 
made a name for himself in this field. Then the sons are always 
under the double pressure of competition. The elder one thus is 
a physicist, he holds a doctorate in this field, but then he 
became a patent lawyer. Our younger son is an electrical 
engineer, who is just now doing his doctoral theses at the 
Munich Technical University and is an assistant there. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Are the two politically active? 
  [Herzog] They have their clear opinions, but they have not 
yet joined a party. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Where would you like to put personal emphasis in 
your new office? Are you concerned with the concept of 
nationalism, which has been strongly put in the foreground again 
by the conservative side? 
  [Herzog] I do not believe that nationalismg or even national 
pride -- I look upon this term with the utmost caution -- can 
really be a motive for our people. However, we do need a 
feeling of belonging together, which, for instance, makes a west 
German agree to sacrifices for the reconstruction in the new 
laender. However, I do not believe that belonging to a German 
or any other nation can still provide additional motivation 
today. This is not a real element of integration. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Is there a specifically German national 
responsibility? 
  [Herzog] In this context too, I would not use the word 
national. There are, of course obligations; ones that stem from 
our geopolitical location above all. Being in the middle of the 
European continent, with borders on all sides, we are in a 
different position from the English. In addition, there is the 
responsibility that stems from our past, and that is something 
that we will not be able to avoid for a long time to come. In 
the end, I think there is a responsibility that stems from our 
prosperity. Whoever is as rich as we are -- despite all the 
difficulties -- has a special responsibility toward those who 
are not faring so well in the world. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Have you been concerned about the future of 
democracy in Germany lately? 
  [Herzog] No, I have been more inclined to feel concern about 
the form that it has assumed at the present time. That is 
connected with the fact that since 1989 there have been too many 
decisive historical developments, too many in relation to what 
the people and politicians can deal with. Germany must now come 
up with a new definition of its role among powerful countries, 
and that also applies to the United Nations. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Should the Germans occupy a seat on the Security 
Council and should they have the right of veto? 
  [Herzog] One should not create a fourth category in addition 
to those countries that do not have a seat on the UN Security 
Council, those that occasionally have a seat on the Security 
Council, and those that are permanent members of the Security 
Council and have the right of veto, that is, a fourth category 
composed of countries that have a permanent seat, but no right 
of veto. Of course, there has to be more discussion on this 
subject. However, I do not think that we should force this issue. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Since unification, it is being repeatedly said 
that the postwar period and Germany's special role are over, we 
have become a normal state that should not have a guilty 
conscience and does not need to address its past any more. Do 
you share that view? 
  [Herzog] In dealing with the issue of overcoming the 
Nationalist Socialist past, I have never placed the main 
emphasis on ascribing guilt, but on learning for the future. 
What that means to me is that in our case it is simply more 
necessary to develop defense mechanisms against all forms of 
totalitarianism. We must be ready to draw appropriate 
conclusions from the horrors of the extermination of the Jews 
and of other minorities. The idea that the postwar period is 
over is something that I find completely unacceptable. 
  [DIE WOCHE] There is a debate in progress in Germany about a 
new right-wing. One can already see that an intellectual new 
right wing is developing to the right of traditional 
conservatism. 
  [Herzog] If one studies the ideology of National Socialism, 
then one finds that apart from such inhuman and absurdly idiotic 
ideas as anti-Semitism, race theory, and the leadership 
principle, there was nothing else to that ideology. That is why 
I cannot imagine a neo-National Socialist theory thriving in 
Germany. I am much more concerned about crypto-Nazis, the older 
generation that has learned nothing and has once again found a 
positive response and followers prepared to copy it among the 
younger generation. 
  [DIE WOCHE] How should one deal with them? 
  [Herzog] They should be confronted directly. That is a 
matter for the police and the judicial authorities first of all. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Does that also mean a ban on parties and 
groupings? 
  [Herzog] If the circumstances are such that one can be sure 
that a court case will be won, then yes. In so far as there are 
intellectual elements in this movement -- and I am very 
skeptical about that -- then one must argue with them. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Your powers as federal president are limited to 
the spoken and written word. Is that enough for such an office? 
  [Herzog] That is what I find attractive about the whole 
thing. I did not seek this office to start by demanding 
additional powers. The powers that exist must be exercised in 
the way that was the case until now, although I hope that the 
instances in which the president really has to set a course, 
namely, when there is no majority capable of forming a 
government in parliament, will not occur. That is something 
that even a professor of constitutional law would not want. 
  [DIE WOCHE] If you are serious about your slogan of "truth 
and clarity," you would have to be continually in conflict with 
the Federal Government, irrespective of its composition. 
  [Herzog] I do not think so. 
  [DIE WOCHE] But that would be the case sometimes. 
  [Herzog] That's life. It is probably something that cannot 
be avoided. 
  [DIE WOCHE] You live in accordance with the principle of 
hope. 
  [Herzog] That is indeed the case.

<F P=106> [Report by Markus Lesch: "Upswing in the East for the </F>
Chancellor"] 
  [Text] Freiberg -- "Good Luck, Good Luck, the Miner is 
Coming" -- the "Saxonia" miners' orchestra is playing as Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, dressed in a blue trench coat, mounts 
the platform at the Upper Market. Freiberg is the last leg of 
this round of the Chancellor's election campaign through eastern 
Germany. Prior to that the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] 
chairman had attended the party conference of the Brandenburg 
CDU in Strausberg near Berlin. In the afternoon, Kohl had 
spoken in Kamenz. 
  More than 10,000 people are crowding the Upper Market at the 
old silver mining town of Freiberg -- a home match for Kohl. 
"We heard that he is coming on the seven o'clock news and came 
here right away," a couple from Doebeln says. They have a small 
electrical supplies company; the chancellor can be sure of 
winning their votes: "We cannot complain, things have been going 
upward." 
  The chancellor hits the right tone when he welcomes the 
political opposition first: "There they are, the 
representatives of the socialist migration," he calls over to a 
small bunch of protesters carrying the inevitable banners 
reading "The head is soft." People with posters saying 
"Messiah, let us have your message," do not stand a chance 
either. Their whistles are drowned in the crowd's laughter, 
people are shouting "Helmut," and in front somebody waves a 
black-red-and-gold flag. 
  "Saxony will be your home country, Germany your fatherland, 
and Europe your future," Kohl calls out at the end of his 
speech, and minute-long applause fills the air. When the 
orchestra plays the national anthem, some are embarrassed that 
they still do not know the text after four years. 
  The scenery at Freiberg is also favorable for Kohl: A great 
deal has changed in the town. The platform has been set up in 
front of the refurbished historic town hall; almost all the 
house facades shine with fresh paint; the university housing 
Germany's oldest mining college is attended by students from the 
West. Pretty pubs are emerging, and beer from Freiberg is 
popular also in the land's capital, Dresden. The people in 
Freiberg are proud of what they have achieved over the past few 
years and of the things they can show the chancellor. 
  In the new laender, there is a clear shift toward the CDU. 
"There is a ray of hope in every village," Saxony's CDU deputy 
chairman Fritz Haehle says. According to an Infratest opinion 
poll, contentedness with the land governments has gone up in all 
the new laender governed by the CDU, including Berlin, since 
February. Eberhard Diepgen in Berlin (+ 16 percent) and 
Bernhard Vogel in Thuringia (+ 13 percent) have been able to 
gain the most in popularity. Over the same period, confidence 
in Manfred Stolpe's SPD-led [Social Democratic Party] 
Brandenburg government has declined by 9 percent, which for the 
first time makes Kurt Biedenkopf's CDU government (+ 3 percent) 
the most popular of all the new laender governments. 
  The CDU is also ahead in Germany as a whole now. At the 
weekend, four research institutes announced that the Union is 
ahead of the Social Democrats. Forsa: 42 to 39 percent, 
Wickert: 39.9 to 37 percent. The figures indicated by Basis 
Research are 39 to 38 percent. And Emnid expects the CDU/CSU 
[Christian Social Union] to win the European elections at 40 
percent, with the SPD winning only 38 percent of the votes. 
With regard to future chancellors, Forsa sees Kohl leading at 
34 percent over his SPD opponent, Rudolf Scharping, who is 
currently supported by 32 percent of the population.

<F P=106> [Report by DIE WELT News Service: "Scharping Mitigates </F>
Criticism of Free Democratic Party"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- Following the harsh criticism voiced by 
Social Democratic Party [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping 
regarding the Free Democratic Party's [FDP] attitude in the 
presidential election, the SPD is now trying to take the edge 
off the debate. Scharping said a certain cooperation could be 
conceivable, above all with those Free Democrats who voted for 
Johannes Rau. However, coalitions should only be considered 
following the Bundestag elections. But his criticism was not a 
signal for a red-green coalition, Scharping said. Antje 
Vollmer, the leading candidate of the Alliance 90/Greens in 
Hesse, sees good chances for a red-green government alliance 
following the Bundestag elections. She said the Greens had 
"offered themselves to the SPD as a reliable partner in the next 
government." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Verheugen in Favor of Red-Green </F>
Coalition"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn, 29 May -- The Christian Democratic Union 
and the Free Democratic Party have described Social Democratic 
Party [SPD] Business Manager Verheugen's latest remarks about a 
ruling coalition between the SPD and the Greens after the 
Bundestag elections as enlightening. In DER SPIEGEL, Vorheugen 
had attacked the Bonn coalition parties and extolled the Greens: 
"We cannot wage the election struggle claiming it is time for a 
change, and then include in the government the very people whose 
policies we want to change. That would make us lose our 
credibility." A red-green coalition no longer appears 
frightening, he said. One cannot expect the present FDP 
leadership and FDP Bundestag group to support reforms. The SPD 
can certainly push through an ecological change easier with the 
Greens, but then the Greens would have to abandon their 
unrealistic positions. The SPD is working toward an election 
result that will provide it with options for the building for a 
coalition, said Verheugen. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Oskar Lafontaine, SPD deputy chairman and </F>
Saarland minister-president, by unidentified correspondent; 
place and date not given: "Nothing Is Taboo"] 
  [Text] [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Lafontaine, according to the latest 
revenue estimates there will be some 35 billion German marks 
[DM] missing from the federal budget by 1997. What effect will 
this have on fiscal policy? 
  [Lafontaine] These new figures show that the holes in the 
budget are even bigger than the Federal Government has admitted 
so far. What is particularly worrying is that the spiralling 
debts have led to a dramatic increase in the interest owed. In 
1995, the government will have to spend one German mark in every 
five on interest. This impairs the state's capacity to act. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Finance Minister Theo Waigel has indicated that 
1995 will see zero growth with all expenditure, which means 
clear cuts in real terms. Is this feasible, also with regard to 
social aspects? 
  [Lafontaine] Over the last few years, savings were enforced 
mainly at the expense of the socially weak. It cannot go on 
like this. The finance minister has to present an honest budget 
and a fiscal plan for several years; and then we will see 
whether it meets the economic and social demands. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Will people now have to expect new tax increases, 
because indebtedness would increase even further otherwise? 
  [Lafontaine] In contrast to its promises, the Kohl 
government decided on tax increases totalling DM116 billion 
after the 1990 elections. Indications are that the coalition 
will not shrink from repeating this tax lie. It is planning 
drastic increases in value-added tax and petroleum and property 
taxes. It also wants to introduce toll charges. With an SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany] government, there will be 
no tax increases. 
  [DIE ZEIT] How would an SPD government deal with these 
enormous deficits? 
  [Lafontaine] The consolidation of public finances can only 
succeed, if, by an effective strengthening of the economy, tax 
revenues are increased and the cost of unemployment reduced. As 
soon as the economy begins to pick up, a strict consolidation 
course is absolutely necessary. In this course, we will 
reexamine all public benefits -- including tax and social 
benefits -- at regular intervals. People can be sure that the 
SPD's consolidation program will be balanced in social terms. 
We must, however, create the necessary preconditions to enable 
noticeable tax reductions in the medium term. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Do these circumstances allow a reform-oriented 
policy? 
  [Lafontaine] Thinking that reforms can only be effected by 
increasing expenditure is a misconception. To bring about 
better environmental protection, or equal rights for women and 
men, a rethinking must first of all take place in people's minds.

<F P=106> ["Guest Commentary" by Theo Waigel, finance minister and </F>
Christian Social Union chairman: "Bugging Campaign: The FDP 
Must Join In"] 
  [Text] The apartment of the normal citizen is sacred to 
all of us. However, that of the drug boss and gangster king 
must not remain closed to the police. Just as in other 
rule-of-law states around us, the police must be able in the 
future to bug German apartments for reconnaissance purposes if 
new crimes are being discussed there. 
  Therefore, I appeal to the delegates of the Free Democratic 
Party [FDP] congress, which begins in Rostock next week, to give 
a signal for the introduction of the great bugging campaign in 
Germany. The population and certainly the majority of the FDP 
followers expect this from their party. Therefore, I hope that 
at the end of the week, the path will be free so that the police 
can combat crimes even more successfully on the basis of clear 
rules of the rule-of-law state, which make arbitrariness 
impossible. 
  The past has clearly shown that, without the great bugging 
campaign to gain evidence, we cannot successfully combat 
international crime in the long run. Therefore, we must act 
together.

  [Text] Erfurt (DDP/ADN) -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
says that the Bundeswehr had invested around 2.7 billion German 
marks [DM] in the infrastructure of the new Laender by the end 
of 1993. Of this amount, DM330 million has been spent in 
Thuringia, Ruehe told correspondents in Erfurt today. In 1994, 
another DM140 million would be allocated there. This afternoon 
Ruehe attended a dedication ceremony for the first 128 
Thuringian Bundeswehr apartments in Bad Frankenhausen (Artern 
district). 
  According to Ruehe, 295 Bundeswehr apartments in eastern 
Germany are to be ready for occupancy this year. The overall 
plan at 44 sites amounts to approximately 7,800 apartments. 
From 1993 to 1995, DM275 million has been earmarked for this 
purpose. For the moment the German Government is helping build 
some 3,000 apartments at 29 sites in eastern Germany. 
  Ruehe said that the Bundeswehr is regarded with growing 
trust 
in the east. A clear indication of this in Thuringia is, for 
example, the links between units stationed there and many local 
communities. Public swearing-in ceremonies are meeting with a 
"positive response." During the floods in April, 1,300 soldiers 
were deployed in Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. 
  The minister stressed that the training level of the 11,000 
east German Bundeswehr soldiers, including 3,000 officers and 
5,000 noncommissioned officers, is "scarcely below" that of the 
west. They will achieve the same operational capability as in 
western Germany by 1995.

<F P=106> [`enn'-attributed report: "Rexrodt Warns Against Panic Over </F>
Eko-Stahl Privatization"] 
  [Text] Berlin, 29 May -- Economics Minister Guenter 
Rexrodt has warned against an outbreak of panic in connection 
with the planned privatization of the Eko-Stahl steel plant in 
Eisenhuettenstadt. The government will continue to support this 
vital industry, he said during the weekend. The Trust Agency is 
making good progress in its effort to find a buyer. The point 
is now to find new markets for Eko-Stahl's products and 
guarantee it a secure future. 
  Rexrodt said his ministry was in close touch with the 
European Commission in Brussels to enable Eko-Stahl to be 
modernized and privatized as quickly as possible. The Economics 
Ministry will answer all European Commission questions regarding 
the Italian Riva Group's abandonment of its bid to take over 
Eko-Stahl, and other questions regarding privatization. 
  Trust Agency spokesman Wolf Schoede said that the Trust 
Agency will continue efforts toward a rapid privatization, thus 
contradicting earlier statements whereby the government would 
not put Eko-Stahl up for sale during the next parliamentary term 
of office. 
  According to Schode, Eko-Stahl is "on the way to 
modernization." With a private investor, the steel plant could 
be led toward a new economic growth. Eko-Stahl must not be 
condemned to a situation where, as a state enterprise, it is 
forced to compete ever more harshly against private industry. 
Unless it gains strategic partners, Eko-Stahl is doomed in any 
case, said Scvhoede. The European Union will hardly grant funds 
for Eko-Stahl's modernization if the government maintains its 
grasp on the firm for the next four years. 
  Following the Riva pullout, the Trust Agency is seeking a 
new 
investor for Eko-Stahl. Of the German steel plants, 
Krupp/Hoesch and Preussag have already said no. Only Thyssen 
continues to be interested in a share in Eko-Stahl, provided 
other investors also take out a share. As a result, French 
steel producers are also being approached to see if they are 
interested a in a share in Eko-Stahl. A particularly 
controversial project is the planned construction of a rolling 
mill costing 1 billion German marks for the purpose of 
converting Eko-Stahl into a self-contained steel plant. In 
order to fulfill the requirements of the European Commission, a 
buyer would probably have to purchase Riva's production quotas, 
because the Italian steel producer, at its Hennigsdorf plant, is 
the only steel facility in eastern Germany with the appropriate 
warm-production capacity. Apparently, other steel plants are 
only prepared to continue the cold-steel rolling process in 
Eko-Stahl, whereby 1,000 of the present 3,000 jobs could be 
preserved.

<F P=106> [`Ke'-signed report: "Support for the Development of Air </F>
and Space Travel Is Essential"] 
  [Text] "State scientific support for the air and space 
industry is essential," said Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, 
opening the International Air and Space Show at Berlin's 
Schoenefeld Airport on Saturday [28 May]. "Although this 
industry is relatively small in terms of the number of employees 
and turnover, it is nevertheless of great strategic importance. 
The existence of an efficient air and space industry is of 
vital importance for Germany, if only because of its enormous 
technological development possibilities," said the minister. 
  "Although on the one hand the aviation and space market 
offers enormous growth opportunities over the next decade, and 
on the other hand the state's financial capabilities are 
becoming increasingly constrained, the state must nevertheless 
offer help because the German aviation and space enterprises 
will probably be unable to face competition from stronger 
enterprises on their own," Rexrodt continued. In this 
connection the minister spoke out in favor of the government 
concentrating on key technologies in Germany and gradually 
abolishing subsidies for those industrial branches that are of 
diminishing importance. 
  He recalled that the most successful joint European 
industrial program, the Airbus project, initiated by means of a 
German-French agreement exactly 25 years ago on 29 May 1969, or 
the development of the Ariana carrier rocket, which is used on 
60 percent of commercial satellite launches these days, would 
not have been possible without state assistance. "In this way, 
we also succeeded in constructing a competitive European 
counterweight to the market- dominant American space industry," 
said Rexrodt. 
  Against this background, Rexrodt sharply criticized German 
Aerospace's [Dasa] decision not to take part in this year's 
show. He said he was sorry that this enterprise did not 
consider it necessary to support the Berlin Air Show's efforts 
to regain its international importance. Earlier on, Wolfgang 
Piller, president of the Association of German Air and Space 
Industry, had said that the German aviation industry requires 
greater security, and warned that with the coming into effect of 
the GATT Treaty, the industry still lacks the opportunities that 
the U.S. aviation industry has. 
  The Berlin show, which was visited by over 40,000 people on 
its first day, was first of all overshadowed by a disaster. On 
the morning of opening day, a small Russian Yak-58 aircraft 
crashed on approach. The show lasts until 5 June. Some 134,000 
people visited it two years ago. 
  There is no doubt that a subject of great interest this year 
will be the new Airbus A-321, as a result of which the show is 
developing into an important trade and information forum between 
East and West. Thus, the countries of Central and East Europe 
are particularly well represented at this year's International 
Air and Space Show, which is organized by the Berlin Fair 
Committee and the Association of German Air and Space Industry, 
with the support of the Brandenburg and Berlin Laender and the 
German Federation.

<F P=106> [Jutta Roitsch report: "FDP Warns of `Descent to Third </F>
Class'"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt, 29 May -- "Germany is in danger of 
sleeping through its future," said FDP [Free Democratic Party] 
Chairman Klaus Kinkel on Saturday [28 May] at the opening of his 
party's Research and Technological Congress in Frankfurt. "We 
are faced with a descent to third class in the industrial fields 
of communications, biological science, and environmental 
science, with which we are going to have to earn our keep in the 
future," he said. 
  Backed by Education Minister Karl-Hans Laermann and 
Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt, Kinkel promised that the FDP would 
gear itself to the "elites," for which he earned a round of 
applause from the 200 or so representatives of science and 
industry attending the opening. Kinkel said that the term 
"elites" still possesses a negative meaning in Germany. "He who 
offers excellent services in his work, and thus lays the basis 
for future prosperity, has no political lobby. Once again we 
need a standard of education that produces elites, and a society 
that respects these elites," he said. 
  At this congress, not a single FDP politician referred to 
the 
"civic right to education" that liberal politicians like Ralf 
Dahrendorf and Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher had once referred to. 
According to Kinkel, the task of a liberal party is to 
"courageously and firmly alter the philosophy of ownership." 
  "We need a modernization of the way of thinking, 
particularly 
among our elites," said Kinkel. This view was seconded by Tyll 
Necker, chairman of the Association of German Industry; Andre 
Leysen, chairman of the executive board of the Belgian Agfa; and 
Hans-Joachim Langmann, chairman of Merck. All three called for 
a "spiritual flexibility" (Leysen) and an "ability to adapt" 
(Langmann) in order to combat lethargy. One cannot attain first 
place without a readiness to take risks and introduce changes, 
it was said. 
  Hartmut Michel of the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics in 
Frankfurt said that the mistrust of new technology must be 
combated at kindergarten stage by means of interesting picture 
books on the subject of science. 
  The political conclusions stemming from this were: "Even 
more competition and a deregulation of the telecommunications 
sphere" and tax concessions for scientific research (Kinkel and 
Necker), a "technological council," to increase the 
receptiveness of new technologies (Necker), and a curb on 
parental desires and a greater influence of teachers on 
children's upbringing (Lermann), in order to make access to high 
schools and colleges more tough.

<F P=106> [Report by Heinz Schmitz: "Bonn Has Ambitious Plans for </F>
Europe"] 
  [Text] In the two-day Franco-German summit, due to open in 
the Alsatian city of Mulhouse today, Federal Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand are planning to 
develop together a program for a year's presidency in the 
Council of the European Union [EU]. Against the background of 
high unemployment, initiatives to promote economic growth and 
employment will stand in the foreground. Germany is to assume 
the presidency of the EU Council on 1 July, to be succeeded by 
France in the first half of 1995. 
  In a government declaration on Europe policy that he 
delivered in Bonn last Friday [27 May], Kohl said that his 
objective was "to achieve certain agreement with our French 
partners to make sure that what we begin during our presidency 
can continue under the subsequent presidency." With measures at 
the national and European level it is of prime importance to 
fight unemployment, Kohl said. 
  This joint initiative is supported by the leading business 
associations in both countries. A joint memorandum of the 
Federal Association of German Industry [BDI], the Federal 
Association of German Employers' Associations [BDA], and the 
National Council of French Employers [CNFP], notes that the 
successive German and French presidencies must be used to create 
the conditions for a sizable improvement in Europe's competitive 
strength and employment. From the business community's point of 
view the decisive step toward improving the job situation in 
Europe is to take some burden off the enterprises. 
  The starting point for a Franco-German initiative are 
probably proposals EU Commission President Jacques Delors made 
in his White Book on Securing Europe as an Economic Center. 
Kohl picked up Delors' suggestions for more flexibility on the 
labor market, reducing ancillary wage costs, creating new 
employment opportunities, and special measures against youth and 
long-term unemployment. 
  Yet, Kohl also mentioned the trans-European networks in the 
areas of transport, energy, and telecommunications as suggested 
by Delors. The objective is to create as quickly as possible a 
fast rail link from London to Moscow via Paris, Frankfurt, 
Berlin, and Warsaw. 
  In one point, Bonn seems to be getting near Delors, whose 
position has been strongly supported by Paris. So far, the 
Federal Government has regarded the creation of European 
networks, particularly in the areas of energy and 
telecommunications, as a task for the private economy, for which 
only the preconditions ought to be created at the political 
level. 
  What Bonn is eager to avoid is giving the EU the possibility 
to finance its budgets via credits through these programs, as 
was suggested by Delors. 
  Thus, Finance Minister Theo Waigel emphasized in the 
Bundestag that for projects related to the transport 
infrastructure, one was expecting "a sizable contribution by the 
European Community, but no new credit instruments." In this 
connection, Waigel mentioned two essential transport routes that 
are important for Germany: the tunnel through the Brenner Pass, 
and a high-speed east-west rail link from Paris via Nuremberg to 
Leipzig and Berlin. 
  Apart from its program on employment promotion, Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Mitterrand, in their talks 
in Mulhouse, will also examine the timetable for European 
monetary union. As a precautionary measure the chancellor 
pointed out that compliance with the stability criteria as laid 
down in the Maastricht Treaty would have precedence over keeping 
up the timetable. 
  The cross-border fight against crime is also of major 
importance for the Federal Government. Kohl and Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel emphasized in the Bundestag that the 
fighting of the narcotics mafia, illegal arms trade, and 
cross-border crime require the creation of a European policy 
authority and agreement on a common asylum policy. Another 
focus of Bonn's European projects is intensifying cooperation 
between the EU and the reformist countries in Central and East 
Europe.

  [Text] Bill Clinton has been interviewed on France Inter 
and France Info. This morning we offer an excerpt of the 
interview given by the U.S. President to Pascal Delannoy. The 
whole interview will be broadcast next Wednesday [1 June] on our 
station. On that day, Bill Clinton will fly to Europe, where he 
will take part in the ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of 
the landing in Normandy. This morning's excerpt concerns Bosnia 
and the possible withdrawal of French troops. What is the 
position of the U.S. President? 
  [Begin Clinton recording in English with superimposed French 
translation] The question is: Do you stay, and would a peace 
agreement be reached if you stayed? I think the French -- and 
this is quite understandable -- do not want to stay and risk 
being caught in crossfire. I say you could stay at least until 
we have exhausted all possibilities of achieving peace, because 
I think there is a chance for us to succeed, and a chance that 
both sides will admit that they are unable to continue fighting 
until the next century and must find a political solution. [end 
recording] 
  Bill Clinton was translated by Pascal Delannoy who, on 
behalf 
of France Inter and France Info, went to Washington to interview 
the U.S. President with three other journalists from 
French-language radio stations -- the Belgian radio RTBF, the 
French-language Swiss radio, and Radio Canada. The interview 
will be broadcast in full next Wednesday on all these radio 
stations.

  [Text] Paris, May 30 (AFP) -- The French Government is to 
make a gift of 25 million francs (4.47 million dollars) to help 
rebuild the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, the French Economy 
Ministry announced here Monday [30 May]. 
  The money will be targetted at the restoration of the 
electricity network around the war-shattered city. The work 
will be carried out by the French power group EDF. 
  Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery said providing the money 
"demonstrates France's will to help the return of normal life in 
Sarajevo and the concern France has to be among the first to 
respond to the needs" of the Bosnian capital. 
  France's role in the two-year Bosnian conflict has dominated 
political debate here since a group of French intellectuals said 
they planned to enter a "Sarajevo list" of candidates for 
European Union elections on June 12 in order to highlight the 
fighting. 
  The list was withdrawn Monday though its organisers said 
they 
would continue campaigning, particularly for a lifting of the 
arms embargo on former Yugoslavia which they see as preventing 
the Bosnian authorities from defending their republic.

  [Text] A first contingent numbering some 100 French UN 
soldiers has returned to France from the Glina region in Croatia 
where they have just spent six months as part of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] in the former Yugoslavia. The soldiers 
belong to the 7th Armored Division based in Besancon. In all, 
slightly more than 900 soldiers of the 7th Armored Division are 
due to return to France during the first half of June. 
Ukrainians, Poles, and Jordanians will replace them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F>
correspondent Noel Velli on 27 May; place not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Juppe] We 
have not proposed sending French peacekeeping forces because we 
were not asked. We have not been asked by the UN secretary 
general. I understand that one party to the conflict does not 
want our participation. That is fine and we take note. What 
France is doing from this point of view is exemplary. Few 
countries have done as much in such a short period of time as 
France in helping the refugees and setting up humanitarian aid. 
  [Velli] What do you intend to do to improve French relations 
with Rwanda if the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] takes power? 
  [Juppe] Well, if the RPF takes power, this will mean that an 
agreement and reconciliation between all the parties to the 
conflict should be reached. This is what France did 
successfully last year with the conclusion of the Arusha 
agreement. The latter was based on the idea of power-sharing 
between the various parties representing the Rwandan population. 
There is no other way. There will come a time when talks on a 
political agreement will have to be held after a cease-fire. I 
am convinced that the usefulness of the French contribution will 
be considered then. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Another statement was made by Cooperation 
Minister Michel Roussin. He said the Rwandan tragedy is the 
biggest human catastrophe of the end of this century.

<F P=106> [Interview with Development Minister Michel Roussin by </F>
Donaig Ledu and Assane Diope on 30 May; place not 
given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Ledu] On several occasions, 
France has been accused of supporting President Habyarimana's 
regime in Rwanda. The Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] has rejected 
both the sending of French UN troops to the country and the 
sending of French weapons to equip UN troops. 
  We asked Michel Roussin how he reacted to these criticisms: 
  [Begin recording] [Roussin] First of all, I am surprised by 
these attacks because I do not see why, in all these affairs, 
France is exposed to condemnation although France has always 
done its utmost, everything it could, to encourage all the sides 
to get organized in that country, in Rwanda, whatever side they 
may belong to, and we thought that, since we had instigated the 
Arusha summit, and the agreement which was signed in 1993, we 
had played our part. 
  We also thought that the replacement by an international 
force of two French units which were in Rwanda was to prevent 
what has happened lately. Therefore, I believe that these are 
groundless accusations and I remember in particular a letter 
sent to the president on 1 September last year by the RPF 
president, who expressed his most sincere thanks for the role 
played by France in these negotiations, the role of an observer. 
  [Ledu] Mr. Minister, the RPF does not want to know anything 
about French soldiers in Rwanda, it does not even want to know 
anything about French weapons which may be used by UN troops. 
There are indeed accusations levelled at France. 
  [Roussin] [words indistinct] the position of the RPF is a 
political position. The RPF has adopted a more radical 
position, it is continuing an offensive and gaining ground in 
order to sit down at the negotiation table in due course, and I 
for one hope that there will be a cease-fire and that the peace 
we have relentlessly been asking for will be achieved as soon as 
possible. 
  The international community may be helpless, but France 
continues despite everything to provide help -- considerable 
help -- to the Rwandan refugees as much as we can since we 
cannot intervene in Rwanda itself, and in Tanzania, where there 
is a huge camp which has been visited by my colleague, the 
health minister, and we are also helping to alleviate the 
suffering and misery of the refugees who are in Burundi. 
  Therefore, it is the international community that I, for 
one, 
find helpless. France is continuing an airlift which has been 
operational for three weeks now and we have distributed 
considerable quantities of food and medicine. We have put 
trucks at the disposal of non-governmental organizations to 
distribute this help. 
  Finally, I believe that France is fully carrying out its 
role. I for one hope that the African community will wake up 
and condemn this genocide, and I hope that this will take place 
soon and that we are going to have a major intervention by all 
our African friends which will placate public opinion which is 
shocked and traumatized by the Rwandan tragedy. 
  [Ledu] Mr. Minister, it goes without saying that France is 
making a huge humanitarian effort right now, but let us go back 
to the RPF. What are the grievances of the RPF? 
  [Roussin] What are you interested in? What are you 
interested in, Madam? Is it the fate of these people, horrific 
pictures of whom we see every day, or is it a political analysis 
which is actually no longer topical? What is topical is the 
fact that the belligerents have stopped at last, that there may 
be a cease-fire, that we may finally be able to look after these 
people. This is the true issue. The motivation of the RPF or 
other movements is a problem for the Rwandans to look into. 
France is not involved in that. French policy has always been 
the following: See to it that this African issue be dealt with 
by Africans. We have always wanted Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, 
Zaire, since it is a regional issue, and -- in a wider debate -- 
the other Africans to mobilize in order to see to it that this 
massacre ends. 
  [Ledu] Assane Diop: 
  [Diop] Mr. Minister, you are saying that this is an issue 
which the Africans should be concerned with. Having said that, 
you did support the Arusha accords, but, as a supporter, didn't 
you withdraw too early? Should you not have waited for this 
national union government to be formed? 
  [Roussin] Not at all, because this was part of the Arusha 
accords. Given that the accords had been signed, a significant 
international force comprising 2,500 people, armored vehicles, 
helicopters was to see to it that calm and peace reigned in 
Rwanda. Given that there had been that killing [of Habyarimana] 
and that violence had started, we realized that the force called 
UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] was not in a position 
to avert the fighting. It is not [changes thought], we were not 
a party to that force, UNAMIR. 
  [Diop] Is it enough to say that this Rwandan conflict, as we 
say in the west, is an ethnic conflict? It is a political 
conflict more than anything else. 
  [Roussin] As far as we are concerned, we.... 
  [Diop, interrupting] When France is accused, it is for 
instance because of the 70 military instructors who were still 
with the Rwandan army until last May in the framework of 
cooperation, of course, Mr. Minister. 
  [Roussin] No. First of all, the figure is wrong, it is. The 
figure is totally wrong, and, and also, I do not [changes 
thought], even if there were 70 instructors, it is not these 
people who started the slaughter we have been witnessing. We 
have, we have cooperation, it was very limited because, as soon 
as the Noroit operation was dismantled and the international 
force, UNAMIR, took over from it, we no longer had any role 
apart from traditional cooperation. Therefore, I believe that, 
again, these are more groundless accusations. 
  [Ledu] Officials of your ministry, the Ministry of 
Cooperation, were shocked by the fact that some Rwandan 
employees with the embassy, the French Cultural Center, etc., 
were abandoned to certain death. 
  [Roussin] No, people were not abandoned to certain death. 
Besides, I will demonstrate that this is not the case. First of 
all, those who wished to return did return. Then French 
citizens died for having protected Rwandans. I lost two people 
with the Voluntary Service Overseas and the wife of one of them; 
they were killed and cut up with machetes for protecting Rwandan 
families with whom they were very close in their home and I 
believe that this is the best answer I can give you. [end

  [Text] Southern Sudan has been going through civil war for 
many years now. Drought, last year's bad harvest, the lack of 
seeds, and the people's difficulties in moving about have only 
made matters worse for people. The threatening famine could be 
as devastating as that which laid Somalia to waste two years 
ago, according to Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF], which has 
warned that humanitarian resupplying by air is becoming 
increasingly difficult. MSF Doctor Karim Lawabia spoke to 
Muriel Pomponne: 
  [Begin recording] [Lawabia] One can say that if nothing is 
done by 30 May there will not be a single plane left to bring 
food to southern Sudan and people will be deprived of food. In 
reports from Juba, our colleagues at AICF [Association 
Internationale Contre la Faim] told us that the food situation 
in Juba was also tragic since the UN operation, Operation 
Lifeline Sudan, has almost put an end to the distribution of 
food on the government's side, that is, in the zones held by the 
Sudanese Government. Moreover, we are now expecting the rainy 
season, which makes air transport totally uncertain, and if 
nothing is done quickly, we--humanitarian organizations--may 
find ourselves in a position where we have to leave because we 
are unable to face up to the food situation. 
  [Pomponne] You have to have agreements with the Sudanese 
Government in order to face up to the food situation, don't you? 
  [Lawabia] The entire UN operation, Operation Lifeline Sudan, 
is taking place with the agreement of the Sudanese Government, 
this is obvious. As for non-governmental organizations, it is 
true that we do not necessarily need the agreement of the 
Sudanese Government, but it goes without saying that, if you 
want to reach the zones that need help, you have to travel for 
one and a half or two hours in Sudanese air space, and you need 
flight authorization from the Khartoum Government or one given 
to the UN operation. 
  [Pomponne] Is action required very quickly? 
  [Lawabia] Very, very quickly. 
  [Pomponne] What is the deadline? 
  [Lawabia] One month, even less. [end recording]

  [Text] Paris, May 30 (AFP) -- French philosopher 
Bernard-Henri Levy on Monday [30 May] reversed a decision on 
fielding candidates in forthcoming European elections on a 
"Sarajevo" platform, which had thrown mainstream parties into 
disarray. 
  His list, made up of French intellectuals and led by cancer 
specialist Leon Schwartzenberg, "will not go to the vote," Levy 
said in a statement. 
  His supporters would "continue to campaign" but "have 
decided 
to pursue their action in other ways." 
  Instead of running for seats in the Strasbourg parliament, 
Levy and his supporters would set up a national committee called 
"Vigilance Sarajevo." 
  Opinion polls showed that the list of Levy, who is a 
partisan 
of the mainly Moslem Bosnian government, could win up to 12 
percent of the vote in France in the June 12 poll. 
  But this would be achieved notably by taking votes away from 
mainstream parties such as the Socialist Party of Michel Rocard. 
  Levy had said that the aim of fielding candidates had been 
to 
ensure that the debate on the Bosnian conflict was at the heart 
of the European election campaign, and had forced both the 
socialists and right-wing government onto the defensive.

<F P=106> [Report by Joseph Mace-Scaron: "Mitterrand-Rocard </F>
Relations: Enemies for 30 Years"] 
  [Excerpt] They have hated each other so much. For 30 years 
[French President] Francois Mitterrand and [Socialist Party 
First Secretary] Michel Rocard have been performing "Who's 
Afraid of Virginia Woolf" on the Left. For 30 years, 
misunderstandings have been added to rebuffs, disdain has 
followed underhand blows. The case of the embargo on arms for 
Bosnia is merely another episode in a long series. 
  After Michel Rocard backed the stance adopted by 
Bernard-Henri Levy, Francois Mitterrand forcefully reaffirmed in 
Wednesday's [25 May] cabinet meeting that he would not accept 
"sermonizers" on this issue. He added that there was no 
question of going back on the embargo which reduces the two 
camps' sources of armaments. Yesterday morning, in an interview 
granted to five European newspapers, he stressed once again, 
that this demand had "not been acted on.... I think this is 
wise." 
  This shows the Elysee's irritation at the Socialist Party 
[PSF] first secretary, who also expressed his anger: "Have you 
ever known an embargo to be imposed on the victim? If we cannot 
protect the Bosnians, they should at least be allowed to defend 
themselves." 
  In private, Mitterrand asserts that the "Europe Begins at 
Sarajevo" list is an operation directed by the PSF first 
secretary or rather by Jean-Paul Huchon, his right-hand man. In 
reply to those who express surprise at this certainty, the head 
of state says that this list -- the ultimate sacrilege -- openly 
attacks the major issue of his seven-year term: France's 
European policy. Moreover, this initiative "obligingly" 
displays the split between the original pro-Mitterrand 
intellectuals and their former champion. 
  At PSF headquarters they are not displeased to see Michel 
Rocard "finally dissociating himself from the Elysee, which has 
so far only distinguished itself by its aptitude to cause 
nuisance." And a jumbled list of examples is given: 
cohabitation which was "too soft" at the beginning, legislation 
on citizenship, and the encouragement given to the formation of 
the Tapie list for the European elections. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Eric Dupin: "Thumbs Up to Research, the </F>
Environment, the Currency"] 
  [Text] With less than a month to go until 12 June, French 
public opinion seems "confused about Europe." The wave of 
anti-European sentiment which the fervent supporters of the 
European Union [EU] feared until recently has not emerged. 
However, judging by the survey carried out by LIBERATION and 
CSA and which we are publishing today, the French do not show 
any enthusiasm for continuing with European integration as it 
has been conceived so far. The harsh criticism expressed during 
the debate on the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty in 
September 1992 is coupled today with the more or less clear 
aspiration for a different Europe. 
  Has European integration gone too far, or not far enough? 
This question causes some discomfort. Half of those surveyed 
refused to let themselves be pigeonholed in one of the two 
traditional categories of "European" or "anti-European": 39 
percent seemed to feel that European integration has gone far 
enough, while 12 percent had no feelings on the matter. Another 
statistic shows that an absolute majority of those surveyed (56 
percent) had questions about the need to move forward with 
European integration. This is a major reservation, in view of 
the fact that it looks like European integration will be 
deepening. 
<H5>  Three Sectors Out of Nine Deemed Positive </H5>
  The number of those who are biased in favor of Europe in 
principle has dropped somewhat. At this point, only one-third 
of the French want to go "further" into the European adventure. 
This Europeanism remains both elitist and leftist. (Footnote 
1) ("Pro-Europeans" are defined as those surveyed who said they 
wanted to vote on the basis of European issues and who feel that 
European integration has not gone far enough. The 
"anti-Europeans" are defined as those who will vote on the basis 
of European issues, but who think that European integration has 
gone too far.) Those who most feel that Europe has not gone far 
enough are senior executives and professionals (40 percent), 
industrial and commercial employers (39 percent), as well as 
leftist sympathizers (40 percent). On the other hand, farmers 
(38 percent) and National Front sympathizers (38 percent) are 
proportionally the most numerous who feel that European 
integration has gone too far. 
  The results of a more detailed assessment of the EU, based 
on 
its performance in various sectors, were rather lukewarm. It 
was deemed positive in just three sectors out of nine: research, 
the environment, and currency. In two other areas (defense and 
education), the negative opinions almost balanced out the 
positive opinions. In the four remaining sectors, which are 
very important in terms of public opinion (consumption, social 
protection, employment, and agriculture), the majority sentiment 
is that the EU "is not heading in the right direction." 
Significantly, it is in the more abstract areas that Europe 
gets high marks. 
  The relative harshness expressed by those surveyed regarding 
education is a rather new development. The number of university 
graduates who felt that the EU's educational policy was going in 
the right direction equalled that of those who thought it was 
heading in the wrong direction (36 percent). European 
employment policy was criticized in particular by young people 
aged 25 to 34 years (72 percent), as well as by workers (73 
percent). It should also be noted that 68 percent of farmers 
think that European agriculture has gone astray. 
  The French would welcome a Europe that moved away from the 
guidelines of the Maastricht Treaty in order to give priority to 
reviving the economy instead of fighting inflation. Two-thirds 
of those surveyed (67 percent) say that it would now be 
desirable "to renegotiate the Maastricht Treaty" (19 percent do 
not think it desirable to renegotiate, while 14 percent have no 
opinion). This opinion, defended at the time of the referendum 
by certain supporters of a "no" vote, is supported by a broad 
majority in all the social categories and among all political 
leanings. Those who voted "yes" on Maastricht Treaty say that 
they support (59 percent) a renegotiation of the treaty. It is 
true that the defenders of Maastricht are currently referring to 
the fact that it is being "overtaken." 
  Faced with worrying massive unemployment, the French would 
like Europe to stop giving the priority to fighting inflation. 
The theme of a revival of European consumption is a popular 
one, especially among employers (63 percent), mid-level 
professions (66 percent), and workers (62 percent). Senior 
executives are more hesitant about a recovery that is likely to 
see a reemergence of inflationary tendencies.. 
  The poll as clearly reflects a desire to see the EU better 
protect employment by backing the idea of Community 
protectionism. Almost three-fourths of those surveyed (72 
percent) would like to see the EU protect its borders "from 
products coming from countries that have a low level of social 
protection." This proposal is applauded by all the French, 
regardless of their socioeconomic status or their political 
views. 
  The idea of enlarging the EU beyond the four countries 
which are just about to be included (Sweden, Norway, Finland, 
Austria) is much more controversial. The majority of leftist 
voters (64 percent) or Greens is seduced by the idea, whereas 
only a minority of rightist voters is (45 percent). The 
conservative electorate is therefore not in favor of a large 
Europe that would welcome the less-developed countries of East 
Europe. All in all, the common denominator in the various 
replies is a certain rejection of the status quo. The French 
don't seem particularly attached to maintaining a Europe as 
defined by the Maastricht Treaty, which is resolutely free-trade 
oriented and ardently monetarist. 
<H5>  Semi-European Election </H5>
  The French attitude toward Europe, however, is not their 
only 
criteria for 12 June -- far from it. As usual, the "European" 
elections will only partly relect their title. Less than half 
of those surveyed said that their vote would be based on 
"European policy issues." Indeed, there will be more people 
voting with a view to domestic politics than the 41 percent who 
admitted that this is what they intend to do. 
  Torn between Bernard Tapie [leftist "Radical Energy" list] 
and Bernard-Henri Levy ["Sarajevo" list], the current campaign 
is having major difficulties dealing with current European 
issues. The positions of various electoral lists on strictly 
European issues are largely unknown. Very few voters 
distinguish between the positions on national policy and on 
European policy, as can be confirmed by the various lists. 
Moreover, on 12 June, a not insignificant minority will seek to 
express its discontent rather than express its approval of a 
political orientation: One-fourth of those surveyed stated that 
they would primarily like to show their "opposition to the other 
lists." 
  The various lists are involved in the European debate to 
much 
different degrees. In view of the positions expressed by his 
supporters, Michel Rocard's [Socalist "European Solidarity" 
list] list easily wins the prize for the most pro-European list. 
The proportion of voters who say they are "close" to Rocard is 
48 percent among the "pro-Europeans," whereas they would give 
Dominique Baudis [majority's "Union" list] only 41 percent of 
the vote. True, Rocard attracts the intellectual and well-off 
Left, the very Left that is the most sensitive to the issue of 
Europe: 43 percent are "close" to him among university 
graduates and 47 percent among senior executives and 
professionals. Jean-Pierre Chevenement ["Alternative Policy" 
list] and Bernard Tapie are both linked to the crisis on the 
Left, which they each express in their own way. This positioning 
is perhaps not alien to the modest score given to the Socialist 
list by opinion polls. 
  The leading anti-European list is headed by Philippe de 
Villiers ["The Other Europe" list]. This deputy from the Vendee 
brilliantly incarnates the Right's "no" as expressed by 
nonsalaried workers and the elderly. The proportion of those 
who say they are "close" to him is 36 percent among the 
"anti-Europeans." His potential voters are easily those who are 
most hostile to the EU. 
  Dominique Baudis' list is buoyed along by an image of 
unanimity. The sociological profile of his supporters is quite 
clearly centered on "people of the Right" (with the same index 
of proximity to the UDF [French Democratic Union] and the RPR 
[Rally for the Republic], but his position on Europe is notably 
ambiguous. The proportion who feel they are close to Baudis is 
virtually the same among the former supporters of a "no" vote 
(44 percent) and of a "yes" vote (46 percent) on Maastricht. On 
most European issues, the ratings given by Baudis' voters are 
very close to those of the electorate as a whole. Hence, 19 
percent of the voters for the UDF-RPR list think that European 
integration has gone "too far," 30 percent "not far enough," and 
38 percent "neither one nor the other." Baudis is comfortably 
planted at the center of French hesitation about Europe. 
  The lists of Bernard Tapie and Jean-Pierre Chevenement look 
like two different reflections of the same crisis of 
representation on the Left. Their audiences are not deeply 
divided on the issue of Europe. Tapie's voters are no more 
intimately federalist than those of Chevenement are hostile to 
the EU: 33 percent of "anti-Europeans" say they are "close" to 
Tapie, whereas 32 percent of "pro-Europeans" say they are 
"close" to Chevenement. The voters for these two lists can be 
characterized by their attraction to the idea of Europe, which 
is coupled with a harsh criticism of Community policies. 
Together with the ecologists, they are distinguished by the 
highest proportion of voters who vote, above all, against the 
other lists. 
  Lastly, the lists of the PCF [French Communist Party] and FN 
[National Front] are essentially focused on domestic politics. 
Their voters are those who, by a vast majority, will make their 
decisions on the basis of national interests. Their electoral 
potential is highly limited: 10 percent of the electorate in 
both cases. The lists of Francis Wurtz and Jean-Marie Le Pen 
have an isolated but loyal electorate. Their criticism of 
Europe is merely the logical extension of their respective 
radicalism.

<F P=106> [Report signed "M.G.": "In Search of High Technology -- </F>
China: Hebei Authorities Courting French Firms"] 
  [Text] A large delegation from Hebei province (the region 
surrounding Beijing) is currently in France to entice French 
firms with investment proposals. 
  As an automatic result of improved relations between Beijing 
and Paris, numerous Chinese delegations are once again finding 
their way to France. Only a few days after the visit by 
Beijing's mayor, during which several French groups announced 
they had achieved their goal, a large delegation from Hebei 
province has come to court French firms. With its 60 million 
citizens, the province is to Beijing what the Ile-de-France 
region is to Paris. Glad to "meet with his old friends again," 
Hebei Deputy Governor Chen Liyou presented a number of projects 
during a meeting jointly sponsored by the Paris Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry and the France-China Committee. 
  The deputy governor explained that the projects pertain to 
transportation (motorways) and electricity generation (power 
plants), and also tometallurgical industry, automobile, 
pharmacy, and mechanical engineering. "We have a few large 
projects, but also a number of initiatives that may be of 
interest to small- and medium-sized businesses," the vice 
governor explained. Like all other Chinese provinces, Hebei has 
been looking for foreign technology to modernize its industrial 
fabric. In the last few years, provincial authorities spent 
$1.2 billion on foreign technology. 
  However, out of this figure, "France's share was a mere $.06 
billion," the governor pointed out. "Many French firms come and 
see us, but we think there are not enough of them," said Chen 
Liyou, who urged those firms present at the meeting to attend 
the international investment forum scheduled to take place in 
Shijiazhuang, the capital, in early September.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "American `U-Turn' on Bosnia"] </F>
  [Text] Severely taken to task in the debate dominating the 
European election campaign, the French Government and the 
president have found a powerful ally in Bill Clinton, who 
recently took a stand against the lifting of the embargo on 
Bosnian arms sales. For the first time, the U.S. President has 
publicly come out against the view held by Congress, the media, 
and the American people. Just like the French and British 
authorities, on Wednesday, 25 May, he stood up to this "very 
simplistic idea." 
  At the same time, in Paris, Francois Mitterrand was once 
again explaining to the government the reasons why he is opposed 
to any lifting of the embargo -- in substance, because he does 
not want to exacerbate the war. At the same time, too, on the 
banks of Lake Annecy, new negotiations started to try and 
persuade Muslims, Serbs, and Croats to accept a territorial 
compromise and put an end to the conflict. 
  In reality, leaving aside the media-oriented or political 
ambitions of the various participants in the debate in France, a 
real race is under way in which morality is taking something of 
a back seat. This is a race between obtaining a political 
settlement, by its nature unfair, for the partitioning of 
Bosnia, or aggravating the conflict. If the negotiators, 
currently in Talloires and due to move to Geneva on 13 June, do 
manage to impose a settlement on the three parties, then the 
issue of the embargo will naturally no longer arise. 
  If, on the other hand, the major powers again fail, then it 
is well-known that Paris and London will start to pull out their 
blue helmets and thus trigger an acceleration of violence on the 
ground. In this event, political leaders could no longer 
continue to avoid the issue: Can we prevent an victimized party 
whom we no longer protect from defending itself against an 
overarmed aggressor? 
  Nevertheless, this question must be framed correctly. A UN 
Security Council decision (which at the moment looks unlikely) 
to lift the arms embargo would apply to the whole of Bosnia, and 
thus to all the belligerents. It goes without saying that this 
will not have the effect of restoring the "balance" between the 
forces present. 
  Although the U.S. President's U-turn is quite spectacular, 
we 
may still wonder if it will in fact have any effect on the 
ground, and whether Bill Clinton's position disclosed on 
Wednesday will put an end to the suspicions (to use a euphemism) 
that Washington is supplying arms to the Muslims. As for the 
negotiations, the Muslims, as the main victims of the conflict, 
do not appear to have many illusions about their chances of 
obtaining a viable territorial agreement. This is clear from 
the initial rumblings from the Talloires meeting and from the 
fact that they have put increased military pressure on the Serbs 
in the north of the country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Barzanti, member of the Italian </F>
progressives and vice president of the European Parliament, by 
Roberto Cassigoli in Florence; date not given: "Barzanti: 
`Europe? We Want Solidarity'" -- first paragraph is L'UNITA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Florence. The elections for the European Parliament 
[EP] seem to coincide with a difficult phase in relations 
between Italy and the European Union [EU]. A phase marked by 
the concerns that the new majority and the new government have 
brought about not only in the EU but also in the single member 
states. We discussed this with vice president of the Parliament 
in Brussels, Roberto Barzanti, a candidate representing the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] in the European elections. 
  [Cassigoli] Do you not feel that Italy is drifting away from 
Europe? 
  [Barzanti] This is quite a widespread conviction. We have a 
government that appears to relaunch the idea of developing a 
hyper-free trade and whose relations with Europe are thought of 
as a contract, in market terms only. Instead I think we should 
confirm our desire to build a democratic, united, and solid 
Europe. In this sense the 1996 deadline that provides for the 
revision of the Maastricht Treaty is important. The Parliament 
that will be elected will, in fact, have the great 
constitutional task of creating a real policy of unity in which 
the interests and needs of Italy must have a positive outlet. 
  [Cassigoli] Competition only at an economic level is not 
sufficient then? 
  [Barzanti] Today a country like Italy can obtain results 
only 
if Europe is founded on the basis of solidarity, which implies 
distributing resources on the basis of territorial imbalances. 
A Europe that is not founded on wars of interest or on opposing 
areas, but that can rediscover a vocation that is authentically 
federal and united in full respect of autonomies and differences. 
  [Cassigoli] Do you not feel that public opinion is 
demonstrating indifference toward elections that seem to count 
more because of their internal power relations? 
  [Barzanti] This is true. Also because of an incorrect 
interpretation of the law on proportional representation that 
should be reflected with a Parliament in which all the 
tendencies of a composite European political panorama are 
represented. If these elections and this law are used as a 
simple tool for revenge or for numbers as an appendix to the 
national political elections, this depreciates European 
competition. I am thinking of Berlusconi, for example, who is a 
candidate in five constituencies when, as prime minister, he 
will not be able to sit at the European Parliament because this 
will not be compatible. Evidently a person who is used to 
having three television networks and some interests in three 
pay-TV networks in addition to supervising three public 
nationwide networks, felt the need to present himself in five 
constituencies. 
  [Cassigoli] What relationship could Italian federalism have, 
as it is viewed in a national context, with the idea of European 
federalism? 
  [Barzanti] Let us reaffirm the objective of constructing a 
federal Europe, even if the inclusion of Norway, Sweden, 
Austria, and Finland will probably occur without serious 
guarantees of institutional reform, democratization, and 
transparency. There is a risk, therefore, of laying claim to a 
federal Europe that is looking for an increasingly larger 
economic space, but without an efficient government. We cannot 
accept this drift. For Europe, federalism is a means of 
balancing the autonomy of the single member states and joint 
policies. From the Italian point of view federalism has been 
carried out in an unfruitful manner. Italy can stay in Europe 
if it remains a nation, even though its various autonomous 
regions must have their own relations with the European 
Community. 
  [Cassigoli] [European Commission President] Delors' white 
paper talks of employment. What relationship is there between 
the Italian problem and the promise made by Berlusconi to create 
1 million new jobs? 
  [Barzanti] With the proposal launched in Delors' so-called 
White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment Europe 
and Italy can achieve important goals. This will certainly not 
occur if entrusted to simplistically thaumaturgic concepts or to 
old free trade visions, but requires a policy that I would 
define as being of the Keynes type. The white paper therefore 
does not seem to be in harmony with the affirmations made by 
Foreign Minister Martino or the economic ministers in this 
government. Of course, the 15 million new jobs forecast in 
Europe between now and the year 2000 can be obtained by playing 
around with deductions and with an increased market flexibility, 
but also by focusing a great deal on training, professional 
profiles, innovation, new strategic sectors, the information 
society, which are still to come in Italy. 
  [Cassigoli] Can you give an example? 
  [Barzanti] Of course. The white paper forecasts 4 million 
new jobs in the audiovisual field. If we consider the fact that 
a cable system does not even exist here, and that the 
technological level of our system is among the most backward in 
Europe, we can see how far away we are from this prospect. 
  [Cassigoli] What will the trends be in scientific research, 
an essential field for relations with Europe? 
  [Barzanti] They are worrying. The EU, and Commissioner 
Ruberti himself, have greatly expanded research resources. In 
the Fourth European Framework Program, scientific research will 
be allocated an overall budget for 1994-98 amounting to ECU12 
billion (the figure was only ECU2 billion under the third 
program) equivalent to 22 trillion lire. However, the situation 
is serious because little is being spent on scientific research 
(2 percent of GNP) and because the countries spend too much 
singularly. The objective is to reach 3 percent of GNP and to 
spend at least 5 percent of this on joint research. 
  [Cassigoli] Europe is also shocked because a businessman 
with 
enormous interests in the information sector has become a prime 
minister without any rules. 
  [Barzanti] It is one of the elements that is creating the 
most anxiety. It is unthinkable for Hersant or Bertelsmann, the 
head of the largest European communications group, or others to 
be ministers or prime ministers in France or Germany. It is a 
South American-type anomaly or perhaps even worse. To have more 
weight in Europe, the person representing the country must be 
capable of speaking without any suspicion that he is defending 
his personal interests.

<F P=106> [Interview with Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio by </F>
Giovanni Valentini; place and date not given: "Senate Will Work 
the British Way"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Valentini] Mr. 
Scognamiglio, you were elected by the Senate by a single vote, 
and the government obtained its confidence vote by a margin of 
two. Can the majority proceed in this way? 
  [Scognamiglio] If the climate of suspense were to remain the 
same, it would become so intolerable as to cause a virtual 
paralysis. But I must admit that the parliamentary opposition 
has already displayed the desire to allow the legislature to 
proceed normally, showing a praiseworthy sense of responsibility. 
  [Valentini] Do you trust their words? 
  [Scognamiglio] Apart from their words, it seems to me that 
the opposition wants to allow this government -- the only 
possible one at present -- to start its work and to show whether 
it is capable of achieving the changes that the country expects. 
And this, without hindering its activity with quibbles, 
filibustering, or sabotage. At least, this is my impression. 
  [Valentini] Perhaps it is also a hope. 
  [Scognamiglio] Yes, both a hope and a forecast. 
  [Valentini] In the institutional context, how do you intend 
to ensure governability in the Senate under such conditions? 
  [Scognamiglio] First, I want to stress something that has 
never happened before, namely, the existence of a different 
majority in the two houses. This is a very new situation, which 
raises all kinds of legitimate questions. But it is also a 
situation of extraordinary openness and stability. 
  [Valentini] Why do you say that? 
  [Scognamiglio] Because it is a situation that influences and 
binds the majority to observance of the ground rules. The need 
to take account of the arguments of the minority is not only an 
ethical matter but has become a political one too. 
  [Valentini] Do you not think that it would have been much 
better, for this very reason, to involve the opposition at the 
parliamentary level -- from the election of the speaker to the 
election of the committee chairmen? 
  [Scognamiglio] Perhaps it all happened rather by accident. 
Be that as it may, there is a high degree of innovation 
compared to the past: The majority's policy is to create a 
majority without negotiating. Previously, however, the dividing 
lines were never clear. 
  [Valentini] What if the experiment fails? 
  [Scognamiglio] Then we would probably return to the 
compromises of the old system. But in fact this is the solution 
that provides the most guarantees for the opposition, insofar as 
its strength can exercise an external influence, a curb, in 
order to make the government's action more cautious. 
  [Valentini] Do you mean that there will be a continuation of 
the "votes market," as happened in the Senate vote of confidence 
in the government? 
  [Scognamiglio] Actually, I saw no such market. Indeed, the 
speeches announcing the votes were extremely consistent with 
principled positions. The majority presented the reasons why it 
supported the government, and the opposition, those why it was 
voting against. And a group of senators, including Mr. Cossiga, 
announced that they did not intend to hinder the majority's 
right to form a government; some of them therefore voted in 
favor, while others abstained. It all happened out in the open. 
This itself is something extremely new. 
  [Valentini] However, the anomalous situation whereby there 
are 11 life senators in the Senate was decisive... 
  [Scognamiglio] No, numerically, their votes were not 
decisive: Three voted in favor, two against, two more abstained, 
and the rest were absent. Everyone can form their own opinion 
regarding the existence of life senators. Personally, I 
consider it appropriate for the republic to recognize with such 
a senior office citizens who have shown special merits, and I do 
not consider it a negligible matter that such figures as 
Cossiga, Spadolini, or De Martino, to name just a few, ensure 
the continuity of a traditional memory. 
  [Valentini] Yes, but the Constitution provides for five life 
senators. 
  [Scognamiglio] Frankly, I dislike the fact that some people 
have decided to debate the matter right now, in connection with 
the vote of confidence in the government. It does not show good 
taste. 
  [Valentini] Some people questioned it long ago, when 
President Cossiga extended the numbers.... 
  [Scognamiglio] Then the question may have been a legitimate 
one. Not now. 
  [Valentini] The progressive forces' leader in the Senate, 
Cesare Salvi, has announced a "British-style" opposition. What 
do you think of that statement? 
  [Scognamiglio] Coming from Salvi, and from Napolitano in the 
lower house, it shows that some opposition representatives have 
understood the new political and institutional situation 
perfectly. And this could rightly lead to greater advantages for 
everyone. 
  [Valentini] Berlusconi said that, whatever happens, the 
majority will not change along the way. Are you not afraid that 
the weakness of the present majority in the Senate could prompt 
recourse to an early election? 
  [Scognamiglio] Judging from the present situation, I would 
say not. If the political situation changes, it could happen. 
Be that as it may, it would certainly not be useful to the 
majority now. And perhaps not to the opposition either. 
  [Valentini] What do you think the Senate's role should be in 
a new constituent period? Will it become the Chamber of the 
Regions? 
  [Scognamiglio] Perfect bicameralism is not a frequent model 
in Western democracies. When the entire constitutional 
architecture changes, so too must the duties of the two houses. 
At the moment, however, it is too early to say how: first, the 
rules, then the roles. 
  [Valentini] As a liberal economist, what is your opinion 
regarding the conflict of interests between Berlusconi the 
businessman and the government leader? 
  [Scognamiglio] Let us be realistic. There are some pros and 
some cons. The cons stem from the fact that the conflict is 
obvious to everyone. Berlusconi's economic interests are so 
open as to provide a guarantee of openness against any abuses. 
If, for instance, his government were to adopt any measures 
against RAI [state radio and television], we could all draw 
certain conclusions. 
  [Valentini] In other words, as far as you are concerned, it 
is an insoluble problem. So what is the point of the three 
"wise men" appointed by Berlusconi himself? 
  [Scognamiglio] Whether there is a solution, I do not know. 
The three "wise men" correspond to a common law juridical 
institution designed to separate the physical person from his 
property. They, if anyone, will suggest a solution. 
  [Valentini] Let us consider RAI: What do you intend to do, 
as Senate speaker, to safeguard this public service against 
private television? 
  [Scognamiglio] The present law, approved in a different 
political situation, makes the speakers of the two houses 
responsible for appointing the board of directors, not for any 
management or monitoring duties. If the law remains as it is, 
when the time comes we will appoint new board members in 
consultation with the speaker of the lower house. We cannot and 
must not do anything else. 
  [Valentini] What did you mean by your reference to "a 
different political situation?" Do you think that law should be 
changed now? 
  [Scognamiglio] The law is obviously obsolete, anachronistic. 
It might have made sense under previous conditions. But now the 
two speakers have been elected by a majority, so that form of 
guarantee no longer exists. In the case of a limited company, 
it is an entirely atypical juridical formula. 
  [Valentini] Who do you think should appoint the RAI board? 
  [Scognamiglio] There could be a hundred different solutions. 
The decision lies with the parliamentary majority. Be that as 
it may, in order to ensure the independence of television news, 
it is also necessary to protect the opposition with a view to 
mutual rotation. 
  [Valentini] As the state's second most senior authority, are 
you not afraid that the presence of post-Fascist ministers in 
the government could cause Italy's international isolation? 
  [Scognamiglio] During the period between the end of the 
previous legislature and the formation of the new government 
there was indeed such a danger. Especially from a distance, it 
was difficult to understand what was new about the National 
Alliance. But now that the government has been formed and the 
foreign minister has been able to provide ample reassurances to 
all our partners, the controversy is dying down. 
  [Valentini] And yet foreign investors are pulling out of the 
Italian stock market, and some countries are even threatening a 
trade boycott against our goods.... 
  [Scognamiglio] Foreign investors have withdrawn because they 
have already made money; and in any case they will return, as 
soon as the privatization process takes place. As for a 
boycott, it is an incredibly remote possibility. The WALL 
STREET JOURNAL's assessment of the government is enough to 
thwart it. 
  [Valentini] What about your hand in your pocket [habitual 
attitude], Mr. Speaker? 
  [Scognamiglio] Well, it brought me luck! 
  [Valentini] Would you do the same again? 
  [Scognamiglio] Yes, I would.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "PSP, 39.4 Percent; PSD, 26.2 </F>
Percent; CDU, 9 Percent; CDS, 7.4 Percent"] 
  [Text] The PSP [Portuguese Socialist Party] has a 
comfortable 13-percent lead over the PSD [Social Democratic 
Party] three weeks from the holding of the elections to the 
European Parliament, according to a major EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao 
opinion poll with 1,051 interviews in mainland Portugal, 
conducted by the ballot box method between 11 and 18 May. 
  With 39.4 percent of voting intentions for Antonio 
Vitorino's 
list, 26.2 percent for Eurico de Melo's list, and just 10.8 
percent undecided, it could be said that right now the PSP is 
virtually assured of victory 12 June, its scale remaining to be 
seen. It is an election triumph that, if confirmed, will follow 
the Socialist victory in last December's local elections, 
placing the PSP in an advantageous starting position for next 
year's legislative elections. And it should be emphasized that 
the poll was conducted on the days when the disagreements 
between Belem Palace and Rato Square [PSP headquarters] over the 
"Portugal, what future?" congress had their greatest coverage in 
the news media. 
  On the other hand, the PSD's prospects are not encouraging. 
Reduced to 26.2 percent (almost the hard core of the PSD vote), 
Cavaco's party is in danger of a second consecutive election 
defeat, and this time with a humiliating difference from 
Guterres' party. Moreover, let it be recalled that the PSD won 
the European elections in 1989 with 32.8 percent against 28.5 
percent for the PSP, 14.4 percent for the CDU [Unitary 
Democratic Coalition], and 14.2 percent for the CDS [Social 
Democratic Center Party]. 
  And if the CDU, with 9 percent in this poll, does not 
diverge 
from its result in the last legislative elections, the 7.4 
percent for Manuel Monteiro's party threatens not to come up to 
the expectations aroused in the CDS and to leave its leader 
short of the result achieved by Lucas Pires five years ago. 
  As regards the small parties, the poll gives the following 
figures: Portuguese Workers Communist Party/Movement for the 
Reorganization of the Proletariat Party (1.7 percent), 
Democratic Renewal Party (0.6 percent), MPT [expansion unknown] 
(0.5 percent), PSN [Socialist Party of Navarre] (0.5 percent), 
Revolutionary Socialist Party (0.4 percent), Popular Democratic 
Union (0.4 percent), PDA [expansion unknown] (0.3 percent), 
Policy XXI (0.2 percent), and Popular Monarchist Party (0.1 
percent). The poll was stratified in terms of region and 
habitat, and the quota method was used with an age/sex/education 
matrix. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percent for a 
degree of probability of 95 percent.

  [Excerpt] Portuguese Defense Minister Fernando Nogueira 
said this morning that Portugal should only have two 
intelligence services, otherwise it will be difficult to recruit 
specialized staff. 
  [Begin Nogueira recording] As the government has advocated 
for a long time -- fortunately the opposition now understands 
this, and we had to wait until a consensus was reached on this 
matter -- Portugal is not big enough nor does it have enough 
resources to have three intelligence services, as provided for 
by the legislation on intelligence services. Other European 
democratic countries of similar size have only two intelligence 
services. 
  In fact recent events demonstrate this. For example, the 
lack of human resources in Madeira, in the secret services, 
shows that if we created three intelligence services, we will 
have even less people. Therefore, we will have the services on 
paper but not functional services. Furthermore, it is not easy 
to recruit qualified staff who understand the difficulties and 
complexities of an intelligence service, who are fully aware of 
the line dividing legitimate information gathering from 
illegitimate practices. All this naturally leads to having two, 
rather than three intelligence services. [end recording]

  [Text] Spain and Cuba signed an investment promotion and 
protection agreement yesterday that, in the foreseeable future, 
will stimulate the flow of more Spanish capital into the island, 
capital that hitherto has been concentrated in the tourist 
industry. At the end of the meeting in Havana of the joint 
commission on economic and industrial cooperation, the agreement 
was signed by Ernesto Melendez, the Cuban minister for foreign 
investment and economic cooperation, and Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, 
the Spanish secretary of state for foreign trade. 
  The most important aspect of the agreement is that it 
establishes measures to stimulate and protect investment. It 
provides for arbitration and conciliation mechanisms and has a 
very positive psychological effect, said the Spanish 
representative, who stressed that the aim is to encourage 
sectors other than the tourist industry because Cuba could 
become a highly attractive country for the Spanish economy.

  [Text] Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn has 
criticized the intergovernmental agreement on the supplies of 
Russian military equipment to Finland signed in March this year. 
Our correspondent Svetlana Pankratova reports from Helsinki: 
  The agreement on the supplies of Russian special equipment 
-- 
as it is called officially -- was signed by the heads of 
government when Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
visited Helsinki in March this year. In line with the agreement 
Russia will supply its military equipment to Finland to the sum 
of 80 billion dollars as payment for Russia's debt to Finland, 
which it inherited after the breakdown of the USSR and which 
amounts to 1.3 billion dollars. In the Finnish defense 
minister's view, artillery mounts and air defense systems that 
Russia is supplying to Finland cannot ensure a reliable 
protection of Finland's airspace since the radius of their 
operation does not cover the entire country. Moreover, 
Elisabeth Rehn has criticized the quality of some of the 
equipment. It is clear that the position taken by Elisabeth 
Rehn with regard to the implementation of the Russian-Finnish 
agreement on arms supplies could lead to some of its clauses 
being revised or to some types of the equipment being replaced 
by different types. However, the agreement is unlikely to be 
canceled since both sides benefit from implementing it.

Minister Godal" -- issued by the Democratic League of Kosova] 
  [Text] The president of the Republic of Kosova, Dr. 
Ibrahim Rugova, was received today in Oslo by the Norwegian 
foreign minister, Bjorn Tore Godal. 
  In a long and cordial meeting, Dr. Rugova briefed the 
Norwegian foreign minister on the situation in Kosova, 
describing it as very tense and dangerous due to total 
discrimination and unabated violence exercised by the Serbian 
regime since the military and police occupation in 1989. The 
Kosova problem requires an urgent solution and concrete and 
comprehensive involvement of the international community, 
President Rugova said. He also said that the solution should be 
sought in the direction of implementation of the right to 
self-determination of the Kosova people. The people of Kosova 
has declared itself for an independent and [words indistinct] 
and repeated his call for a temporary international civil 
protectorate in Kosova. He called on the Norwegian Government 
to help in reaching a solution to the Kosova issue within a 
global approach for the solution of the former Yugoslav crisis. 
Without a just solution of the Kosova question, no lasting 
peace in the Balkans is possible, Dr. Rugova said. 
  The Norwegian foreign minister, Godal, said he was honoured 
to meet Dr. Rugova and that his country admired the peaceful 
policy of the Kosova people and that it had understanding for 
their demands. Mr. Godal praised the readiness of the Albanian 
side to solve the problem through dialogue. We are concerned 
for the situation in Kosova and we would like to see a solution 
as soon as possible, he added.

<F P=106> [Article by Dick Ljungberg: "Worn-Out Ministers Tough It </F>
Out"] 
  [Excerpts] The hair on the ministers who entered the 
coalition government in October 1991 has turned considerably 
grayer. They had no idea of the extent of what was waiting for 
them: a budget crisis, a foreign exchange crisis, a bank crisis, 
and mass unemployment. But despite what many people were 
predicting, they are still in office as we approach the finish 
line. 
  The most competent government's trip down the only path, as 
the saying went at the time, got off to a flying start. But it 
may end this spring with the government going from setback to 
setback in the Riksdag and, like a groggy boxer, staggering 
around the ring waiting to be rescued by the sound of the bell. 
  The New Democrats are the ones who may mess things up again. 
A little over a year ago, when Carl Bildt threatened New 
Democracy with new elections, he brought Ian Wachtmeister to his 
knees. At least the New Democracy group thought so, and now it 
is coming back with renewed opposition strength. 
  So far, the threat of new elections has been the minority 
government's only serious crisis in the Riksdag. And on one 
occasion it was almost made from within the coalition: in 
January of this year over the issue of the bridge over the 
sound. Olof Johansson argued with the other three party leaders 
about the bridge for 25 hours, he says, and at one point he 
yelled at the prime minister: "What the hell do you think you 
are doing?" 
<H5>  Center Party Made Threats </H5>
  There were also a few near-accidents during the negotiations 
over the emergency package in the fall of 1992. The Social 
Democrats were demanding that the KDS [Christian Democratic 
Party] and the Center Party be ignored on the issues of the home 
care allowance and agricultural subsidies respectively, but in 
the interest of solidarity, Bildt firmly refused. 
  During the negotiations, Bengt Westerberg wanted to raise 
the 
value-added tax on food items back up to 25 percent. 
  "If that happens, I'm walking out the door," Johansson 
threatened, and no more was said about it. 
  So why has the government managed to hold together despite a 
series of splits that often grew worse because they were leaked 
to the mass media? 
  The simplest answer is that the four parties had no choice. 
One more fiasco after the mess they made from 1976 to 1982 would 
have discredited the nonsocialist alternative for government for 
the rest of the century. 
  And it is nonsocialism, not bourgeois ideology, that has 
been 
the cement holding the government together. 
  Carl Bildt, Bengt Westerberg, and Olof Johansson were also 
together the last time around, and they benefited from that 
experience when the new government was being formed. [passage 
omitted] 
  Johansson has his own explanation for why things have gone 
better than the last time. He says it is easier with four 
parties than with three. Four parties provide more opportunities 
for getting support from some other party on an issue -- it is 
not just a matter of two parties ganging up on the third. 
  As prime minister, Bildt gets good marks from the other 
parties. He is considered to be a surprisingly good team leader 
who has the ability to enliven the atmosphere while also being 
very dexterous when it comes to finding solutions. 
  But there is a general complaint: Bildt likes to put off 
difficult decisions, something that irritates the more 
executive-minded members of the Cabinet Office. 
<H5>  Bildt Lacks Warmth </H5>
  It is also said from the inside that there has been a lack 
of 
"warmth and feeling" in the political message. That criticism is 
directed against the entire government, but as prime minister, 
Bildt sets the tone. 
  The government has also been helped by the Social Democrats. 
Broad agreements have been reached regarding the European Union 
[EU] negotiations and changes in the Constitution. [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  Loyal KDS </H5>
  Johansson was regarded as the doubtful card, especially by 
the Liberal Party, when the Center Party entered the government. 
But despite the ups and downs regarding the bridge and nuclear 
power, Johansson has been a surprisingly positive member of the 
government. Anne Wibble says in her new book that while 
Johansson has certainly not been a driving force in the 
government when it comes to saving money, neither has he been an 
obstruction. 
  Concerning the negotiations on the government's 
81-billion-krona reorganization program, Wibble reports that 
Olof often said "think about its distribution," while Alf 
Svensson was constantly interjecting: "We must find room for the 
home care allowance." 
  The KDS ministers have been very loyal members of the 
government. In Svensson's words, they have "sat still in the 
boat." They have almost always stayed close to the Moderates. 
The KDS' immediate entry into the government put great pressure 
on the party's political and personnel resources. Its fast 
promotion was also something of a culture shock as far as the 
party's voters were concerned, and this can be seen in the 
public opinion polls. 
<H5>  Liberal Party a Concern </H5>
  The man who has caused the most concern among the voters is 
Bengt Westerberg. After the matter of the New Start program with 
Bildt was settled, the Liberal Party leader began distancing 
himself more and more from Moderate Party policy, chiefly on 
welfare issues. 
  Westerberg has played a very constructive role in the 
government, but he has also won a few rounds. His defense of 
general welfare -- and of the tax burden -- has not really 
caused any serious crises in government work. His Ministry of 
Social Affairs has probably saved more money than all the 
Moderate ministers combined. On the other hand, he does not rate 
highly with Moderates in the Riksdag. Even Center Party and KDS 
members think that the Liberal Party leader "jumps in everywhere 
with his lecturing." 
  The four coalition parties would like to view the program 
agreed on after the 1991 elections as a contract. They pledged 
to stick together on a policy along those lines, but this did 
not mean that the parties lost their right to defend their own 
identities and core issues. 
  That is what we are going to see in the election campaign: 
each of the four coalition parties going out on its own to 
attract as many voters as possible with a smorgasbord of good 
proposals. But not all of those proposals are going to be 
consistent with that contract. If the government survives the 
elections, it will soon have to face new and vexed negotiations 
on nuclear power, welfare and basic security, tax reductions and 
tax changes, municipal finances, our EU policy when it comes to 
defense and foreign exchange, and a long list of issues that 
will face us over the next four years.

<F P=106> [Article by Dick Ljungberg: "Mediocre Passing Grade"] </F>
  [Text] Has the government done more or less what it 
promised, or has it let the people down? The Temo public opinion 
institute has surveyed voter opinion as DAGENS NYHETER continues 
to scrutinize the government. The first of a series of 
grass-roots voters also express their opinion of the government 
and their party leaders. 
  Nearly half the Swedish voters give the Bildt 
government a mediocre passing grade for its years in power. The 
government has performed neither better nor worse than expected, 
they say. In the nonsocialist corner, supporters of the Center 
Party and the KDS [Christian Democratic Party] are the ones most 
dissatisfied with the government. 
  The high unemployment rate is what drags the nonsocialist 
government's grade down, but many people are favorably surprised 
that it managed to hold together at all. 
  The above is shown by an opinion poll conducted by Temo for 
DAGENS NYHETER to ascertain people's views of the Bildt 
government and its policy. The poll, which was concluded last 
week, comprised 1,000 interviews. 
  When asked their views on how well the nonsocialist 
government had done its job, 15 percent of Swedes said "better 
than expected," 46 percent said "neither better nor worse than 
expected," and 36 percent said "worse than expected." 
<H5>  Little Difference Between Sexes </H5>
  The answers do not reveal any major differences between men 
and women or the various age groups. But those saying that the 
government has done its job worse than expected are mainly 
voters with little education, living in sparsely populated 
areas, and earning relatively low incomes. 
  Naturally, it is primarily Social Democratic and Left Party 
voters who feel that the government has performed worse than 
expected: a full 47 percent. But 44 percent of Social Democrats 
feel that its performance was neither better nor worse than 
expected. 
  The reason, of course, may be that their expectations of how 
the Bildt government would do were low to start with. But 7 
percent of Social Democrats feel that the government has 
performed better than they expected. 
<H5>  Some Have Left </H5>
  Since the government took office in October 1991, about 10 
percent have left the nonsocialist camp, according to the polls. 
Many of those are probably to be found among the 47 percent of 
the Social Democratic Party's supporters who think the 
government has done worse than expected. 
  Among nonsocialist voters, 48 percent say "neither better 
nor 
worse." "Better than expected" is the answer given by 27 
percent, and 22 percent say "worse than expected." Most 
disappointed are Center Party and KDS voters, with 37 percent 
and 35 percent respectively feeling that the government has 
turned out worse than expected. 
  Those most pleased, and to a corresponding degree, are 
Moderate and Liberal Party voters, where 34 percent and 35 
percent respectively feel that the government has performed 
better than expected. 
<H5>  Asked To Explain </H5>
  Those saying that the government had performed better than 
expected were asked to explain their answer. 
  The most common answer, by 38 percent, was that they were 
favorably surprised that the government was able to hold 
together during the election period. The fact that the 
government was able to handle the financial crisis and pursued a 
good economic policy was mentioned by 31 percent, mostly 
Moderates. 
  Issues such as the European Union [EU] agreement, low 
inflation, privatization, and better conditions for business 
were mentioned only in isolated cases. 
  Of those feeling that the Bildt government has performed 
worse than expected, all 48 percent say that unemployment and 
the employment policy are the reason. The figure is 27 percent 
among nonsocialists and 52 percent among Social Democrats. This 
further underscores the fact that unemployment is going to be 
the big issue in this fall's election campaign. 
  Excessive cutbacks in the public sector (the Health Service, 
child care, and so on) are mentioned by 26 percent (15 percent 
of nonsocialist voters and 29 percent of Social Democratic 
voters feeling that the government's performance was worse than 
expected). 
<H5>  Feel Unfairly Treated </H5>
  The government's inequitable policy favoring business and 
the 
well-to-do and treating the worst off unfairly was the answer 
given by 17 percent (11 percent of nonsocialists and 14 percent 
of Social Democrats). 
  Among nonsocialists who are disappointed in the government, 
14 percent -- presumably mostly Moderates -- say the reason is 
that tax reductions have been too small or nonexistent.

<F P=106> [Sune Olofson report: "Billion-Krona Shortfall for Defense </F>
Forces"] 
  [Text] The 1992 Defense Bill is about to fall apart. The 
finances of the defense forces are now so overextended that 
major cuts in activities and materiel projects will be necessary 
after the election. 
  For the JAS project alone there is a shortfall of 4 billion 
kronor over the next few years. 
  "It can be said -- and needs to be said -- without any 
beating around the bush that the economic margins for the full 
implementation of the defense bill are extremely small," the 
Moderate Coalition Party's Arne Andersson, the chairman of the 
Defense Committee, said in the Riksdag two weeks ago. 
  Defense Minister Anders Bjorck takes a completely different 
view. 
  In the Riksdag debate on defense on 4 May -- the same day 
that SVENSKA DAGBLADET published new figures about the defense 
forces' hard-pressed finances -- the following was heard from 
the defense minister: 
  "Figures plucked from the air, rigged and groundless, 
published to serve certain purposes when there is a defense 
debate." 
  But since the beginning of the year the Defense Ministry has 
been alerted by Supreme Commander Bengt Gustafsson and Air Force 
chief Lars-Erik Englund to significant problems in the field of 
economic planning, chiefly in relation to the JAS project. 
According to military headquarters, Anders Bjorck is not 
particularly interested in tackling the problems before the 
election. 
  "The defense minister is clearly prepared to leave the 
beginnings of a bankrupt estate behind him," a high-ranking 
officer in the planning department at military headquarters said. 
  SVENSKA DAGBLADET has seen an internal document put together 
by the Defense Committee on 11 May. The document makes it clear 
that if the krona does not become stronger and the dollar weaker 
within the next year the Air Force and the JAS project will be 
faced with major economic problems. 
  Hitherto the crisis has not been an acute liquidity problem. 
  But in the 1994/95 budget year the two-year lag of the 
"incomplete price compensation system" for the defense forces 
could lead to a liquidity problem because the changes in 
exchange rates since 1992 have been very great. A liquidity 
problem would mean that the Air Force would quite simply be 
unable to pay its bills. 
  "The price compensation system was not designed, when it was 
introduced, to deal with changes as large as those there have 
been recently," the defense committee writes. 
  In addition to the exchange rate problems and the difficult 
balancing act between budget and five-year planning in the 
defense forces, the Air Force has also admitted an annual error 
of 342 million kronor in reporting the materiel costs of the JAS 
project. 
  In their reports to the Defense Ministry the planners have 
failed to inform the ministry that there is an indirect exchange 
rate dependency in Swedish JAS materiel and this means that too 
little money has been given to the Air Force. 
  According to the Air Force chief, this misreporting alone 
will lead to a shortfall 1.7 billion kronor in the period 
1994-99. 
  When the exchange rate problems, which arose when the krona 
was cut adrift from the ECU (import prices fro the JAS project 
then rose by 25-30 percent), are added to the misreporting a 
shortfall of almost 4 billion kronor for the same period arises. 
In the years up to 2005 the shortfall will increase to all of 7 
billion kronor if the krona does not become stronger. 
  If the conditions affecting the Air Force's planning and 
finances are not straightened out by the government, Air Force 
chief Englund, who retires on 1 July, believes that he cannot 
take responsibility for orders for radar pursuit missiles, 
warning and countermeasure equipment, and the reconnaissance 
capsule for the JAS 39 Gripen. These very important systems -- 
crucial for possible future exports of the 39 Gripen -- will 
simply have to be removed from the plans. 
  "Of course, one alternative is to take a chance and hope 
that 
the value of the krona rises by 30 percent against the dollar, 
but who can guarantee this? The dollar is also thought to be 
undervalued at present. We have to plan in line with real and 
correct figures," the headquarters officer said. 
  The defense forces have been wrestling with poor planning 
and 
financing for decades, both under Social Democratic and 
nonsocialist governments. 
  It seem to be verging on the impossible to reach a five-year 
balance between money allocated, materiel orders, and operations. 
  A little while ago the Defense Ministry was forced to pay 
out 
an additional 400 million kronor to the Navy. 
  If there is a Social Democratic government this fall it is 
expected that, regardless of the current planning problems, 
there will be major cuts in defense in order to continue the 
process of modernization that has been initiated. 
  The Social Democrats want to cut the Army by 50 percent and 
also cut 1 billion kronor from the defense budget. 
  Liberal Party leader Bengt Westerberg, who can envisage 
ruling together with the Social Democrats, has given advance 
warning of cuts of up to 30 percent in the defense budget after 
1997. 
  All in all the whole issue is an equation that is very 
difficult to solve.

sets out levels of military activity and purchases of materiel 
for an amount of money fixed by the Riksdag.

<F P=106> [Article by Heidi Avellan: "JAS Still Flying Despite </F>
Crashes"] 
  [Text] Linkoping, Sweden -- Finland chose the Hornet. The 
Plowshare Movement slipped into the factory [and damaged planes 
with hammers]. The only customer's only plane crashed last 
summer with a roar -- only inches from a crowd of people in the 
middle of Stockholm and a hairbreadth from causing a giant 
disaster. The new Swedish multirole combat [JAS] aircraft was 
the subject of big and unfavorable headlines. But at Saab in 
Linkoping, the JAS project is continuing. 
  Automobiles and airplanes -- that is what Saab has become 
known for. 
  The group is represented in the air by both civilian and 
military aircraft. Saab Aircraft is the world market leader when 
it comes to regional aircraft. In the case of aircraft carrying 
from 20 to 39 passengers, the Saab-340 has a worldwide market 
share of 37 percent. But civilian aviation has had a few rough 
years; people have been traveling less since the start of the 
1990's. This also means that the demand for new aircraft has 
diminished, and there is sizable overcapacity in the aviation 
industry today. Last year's big market share involved no more 
than 28 aircraft, compared to the 49 delivered 10 years earlier. 
It is primarily the problems on the civilian side of the market 
that have dragged profits down. Profits last year totaled 245 
million kronor. 
<H5>  From Rotary Cultivator to JAS </H5>
  Although civilian aviation is experiencing problems, Saab's 
management has great faith in military aviation. 
  Putting it simply, the Swedish military aviation industry's 
roots go back to a handshake between the builder of the Swedish 
welfare state, Per Albin Hansson, and the Wallenberg industrial 
family: the Swedish Air Force would buy Swedish planes, and that 
laid the foundation for a Swedish military aviation industry. 
First came the Tunnan in 1951, followed by the Lansen in 1955, 
the Draken in 1960, and the Viggen in 1973. And, 20 years later, 
the Gripen. 
  A test plane was transformed into a rotary cultivator during 
an air show in Linkoping. The first plane to be delivered to the 
only customer to date -- the Swedish Armed Forces -- 
crash-landed in front of thousands of spectators and hundreds of 
video cameras during last summer's Water Festival. Then there 
was almost a giant disaster in the middle of Stockholm when the 
next aircraft crashed, as if by a miracle, in what was 
practically the only uninhabited piece of ground in the entire 
inner city. 
  But despite those attention-getting nose dives, despite the 
fact that no export opportunities have yet appeared, and even 
though the international Plowshare Movement was able to 
"sabotage" one aircraft, Sweden believes in the JAS 39 Gripen. 
<H5>  Saab Defense </H5>
  The military is now operating in an entirely new 
environment, 
defense and security policy is being revised, military budgets 
are being cut, and the Armed Forces are changing. In those 
circumstances, the Saab group wants to be in the lead pack, so 
at the start of this year, the group's various military 
divisions -- aircraft, missiles, electronics, and optronics -- 
were combined into a single unit called Saab Defense. With that 
"Defense" unit, Saab wants to create a distinctive image for 
itself in the military area. 
  "Now that the Armed Forces are being reduced, it is 
necessary 
to focus even more strongly on quality -- to be technically 
sharper," explains Kai Hammerich, the group's vice president. 
"And we have a number of interesting products." 
  The big product is the JAS 39 Gripen: the company has 19 
billion kronor worth of orders on its books, and the Gripen 
currently accounts for 16 billion kronor of that. The only 
customer is the Swedish Armed Forces, and they will receive 
their second plane within the next few days. It was the Armed 
Forces' first plane that crashed in Stockholm in August. Since 
then, a Riksdag committee has examined the Gripen program and 
expressed full confidence that the program is being handled 
correctly and that the goals will be achieved. 
<H5>  For 16 Squadrons </H5>
  Also satisfied despite the crash is Claes G. Wretfors, chief 
flight engineer of the Defense Materiel Administration, which 
handles purchases for the Armed Forces. He says the plane that 
is now ready for delivery is more advanced than the one that 
crashed, has more functions, and is being inspected extra 
carefully in a "type inspection." Five more aircraft are to all 
intents and purposes ready for delivery after that, and the 
Armed Forces will have received a total of 10 planes by the end 
of the year. 
  In all, the current order calls for 140 aircraft, or enough 
for eight squadrons. Two operational squadrons will have 
received their aircraft by the end of 1997. 
  The armament, meaning the weapons carried by the aircraft, 
is 
ready, generally speaking. The thing that is still lacking is an 
active radar-guided missile, a weapon described in U.S. Air 
Force parlance as "beyond visual range." 
  More orders are on the way, and all 16 squadrons will 
eventually be flying Gripens. 
  The JAS 39 Gripen has been called a cheap aircraft. 
Obviously, a unit price is hard to calculate, but Wretfors 
estimates a figure of from 150 million to 160 million kronor for 
the Swedish version and about 200 million kronor for one 
equipped for export. He claims that at today's prices, the 
Viggen would be more expensive. Above all, the JAS is relatively 
cheap to operate: The operating cost per hour is said to be 
20,000 kronor, compared to 38,000 kronor for the Viggen and 
100,000 kronor for the MiG. 
<H5>  We Will Sweep Clean </H5>
  In the Armed Forces, people were not entirely pleased at 
first when the politicians decided, before the JAS program 
began, that it would involve a light concept with small and 
inexpensive aircraft. Brigadier General Rolf Clementson admits 
it. In other parts of the world, the emphasis was on bigger 
planes. 
  But the military gradually came to realize that the 
politicians had not been wrong in their vision. It is a fact 
that aircraft are priced by the kilogram, and a small plane is 
cheaper than a large one, he says. Moreover, there is no need to 
invest in advanced technology to conceal the plane from the 
enemy -- small planes are harder to see. From a tactical 
standpoint, it is right to have a lot of small planes working 
together, Clementson explained, and he showed diagrams of how 
air fights are expected to go: 
  "We'll sweep the firmament clean." 
  As we all know, Finland has chosen another fighter plane, 
but 
no one at Saab is admitting disappointment over that today. 
  "It is true that an order would have been welcome," Kai 
Hammerich says. 
  But the takeoff run for new combat aircraft is a long one, 
and the JAS was not ready at the time. 
  "We wanted to join in and compete for the order even though 
we knew that we were really too early, considering Finland's 
time constraints."

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis confirmed 
that the Cyprus Government expects the UN secretary general's 
report to be issued tomorrow. He added that the government 
believes that it will be an objective report that will record 
the facts that attribute blame to the Turkish side. He also 
noted that the confidence-building measures [CBM's] issue has 
ended. Mr. Kasoulidhis further said that the government does 
not see any reason for President Glavkos Kliridhis, who is 
visiting New York, to discuss the CBM's with the UN secretary 
general. 
  The spokesman added: The Cyprus Government believes that the 
Security Council should find other ways to participate in the 
process of promoting a Cyprus solution. He also made it clear 
that the government desires to participate in any of those 
alternative plans of action, which should be decided by the 
Security Council on the basis of Resolution 889.

  [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis stressed that the 
decision falls within the joint Cyprus-Greece defense doctrine 
whether to build air, navy, or other bases in Cyprus. President 
Kliridhis made the statement after his meeting at the 
Presidential Palace today with Lieutenant General Alevromayiros, 
first deputy chief of the Greek Army General Staff. He also 
expressed full satisfaction over the joint Cyprus-Greece defense 
doctrine and noted that at the meeting they also exchanged views 
on the doctrine, adding that both sides are proceeding with the 
preparation of a Cyprus defense plan. 
  President Kliridhis also referred to the Turkish plan, which 
was revealed by the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation last night, 
aimed at justifying their rejection of the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's] by creating the impression that the coexistence 
of Greek and Turkish Cypriots is impossible. The president 
expressed the conviction that the Turks will not succeed in 
justifying their positions because, he stressed, it is well 
known that there have been no provocations by the Greek Cypriot 
side. He added: The Turkish side rejected the CBM's because of 
a lack of political will. 
  Lt. Gen. Alevromayiros expressed thanks to the Cyprus 
Government for the material and moral support it renders to 
ELDIK [Greek Forces of Cyprus]. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis stressed that Cyprus is 
not seeking free entrance into the European Union [EU], but 
wants to fulfill the expectations of its role and its 
contribution to the world order being created. 
  Addressing a high-level conference on EU law which began 
this 
morning in Nicosia, the president said Cyprus is fully committed 
to its European orientation because it believes in the role, the 
mission, and the need for the EU. He added that Cyprus asks for 
nothing more than to be a republic that applies to the whole of 
Cyprus' territory, something that cannot happen now because of 
the de facto division imposed and maintained by the presence of 
Turkish troops and settlers. 
  European personalities, distinguished judges of the EU 
court, 
senior officials, and academicians from EU member states are 
participating in the two-day conference.

  [Text] Nicosia, May 27 (CNA)--Russia and Cyprus held talks 
this week in Moscow on bilateral issues concerning 
telecommunications and postal services. 
  The talks were conducted between Communications and Works 
Minister Adhamos Adhamidhis and Russian officials during 
Adhamidhis' eight-day visit to Moscow, which ended this morning. 
  Discussions focused on the possibility of amending an 
existing bilateral agreement on air transport to allow an 
increase of the respective national carriers, from one to two. 
  A Russian delegation is expected to visit Cyprus soon to 
examine in detail the repercussions of such a move. 
  Direct satellite telecommunications links were also on the 
agenda of the talks, during which the two sides expressed 
satisfaction with this facility. 
  Cyprus suggested that its network is used to link Russia 
with 
Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Greece, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The 
matter will be discussed further at a later stage. 
  The ministers decided to organise a joint philatelic 
exhibition and possibly issue a common series of stamps.

<F P=106> [Report by Khriso Andoniadhou] </F>
  [Text] Cyprus is being used as a transit point for dirty 
money. Offshore companies, which are linked directly to 
countries where dirty money is rife, use Cyprus to legalize 
their unlawful actions. Although the Central Bank has 
repeatedly sent circulars to commercial banks to avoid use of 
the banking system services for dirty money purposes, no oney 
can know whether and to what extent dirty money moves in Cyprus 
through banks that operate here. Central Bank Governor Avxendis 
Avxendiou's assurances that no dirty money moves through Cyprus 
are unconvincing. This is because government departments are 
investigating files of evidence about offshore companies with 
"mysterious" dealings and "ghost" transactions. It appears 
clear in specific cases that Cyprus is also used by swindlers to 
facilitate transiting their money through clean channels in 
Cyprus to European banks. 
  I SIMERINI has seen a Central Bank document which shows the 
ways that offshore banks launder dirty money. The following are 
the main ways: 

  -  New customers open an account after being 
recommended by a branch abroad or another bank whose 
headquarters is in a country where the production, trafficking, 
or trade of narcotics are well known. 
  -  The use of credits or 
other means of trade financing to move money between countries 
when such trade is incompatible with the usual business 
activities of the customer. 
  -  Customers who make regular, large 
payments, including electronic remittances, when it cannot be 
established that such transactions are made "in good faith" or 
when the customers regularly collect large amounts from 
countries involved in the production, processing, or trafficking 
of narcotics. 
  -  The creation of big credit balances in accounts 
when this is incompatible with the known profit of the 
customer's business and when, later on, these balances are 
transferred to accounts abroad. 
  -  Electronic inflows and 
simultaneous outflows of money by customers without these 
transactions passing through a specific account. 
  -  Frequent 
applications for the issuance of traveler's checks, foreign 
exchange checks, or other negotiable means of payment. 
  -  Frequent 
deposits of traveler's checks and foreign exchange checks coming 
from abroad. 
  -  Numerous and frequent incoming electronic 
remittances to a specific account.

  [Text] The Central Bank yesterday refuted new allegations 
that Cyprus offshore enterprises are being used for money 
laundering. 
  In a statement issued yesterday the Bank called the latest 
reports, published in yesterday's Greek press, "untrue and 
completely incompatible with evidence and information the 
Central Bank has in its hand." 
  It stressed that contrary to the reports, the Central Bank 
has no knowledge of "mystery payments" which are allegedly in 
the hands of the government for investigation. 
  The Central Bank recognises the international problem of 
money laundering and countries must take preventative measures 
to stop it spreading, the statement said. 
  In Cyprus the Central Bank has its own measures aimed at 
helping the banking system recognise in advance possible suspect 
cases. 
  These measures are the same as those taken worldwide by 
other 
central banks and the result of international directives and 
recommendations. 
  The Bank criticised yesterday's reports saying the Cypriot 
newspapers portray Cyprus as a country for laundering dirty 
money tarnishing its reputation and prestige abroad. 
  "Similar accusations have been made in the past aimed at 
harming Cyprus as a competitive offshore centre," the Bank said.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has declared that if the 
promises made to the Turkish Cypriot side in Vienna are 
incorporated into the 21 March document, the Turkish Cypriots 
can make a healthier and more positive decision on the subject. 
The Council of Ministers met in an extraordinary session under 
the chairmanship of Denktas last night and discussed the 
confidence-building measures package and the nondocument 
document of 21 March. Denktas issued a statement at the end of 
the meeting, which began at 2015 and lasted two hours and 40 
minutes. 
  In his statement, Denktas reported that he briefed the 
Council of Ministers on his contacts in Turkey and said that a 
good discussion was held at the meeting. Noting that he must 
call and meet with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
assistant special envoy in Cyprus, Denktas said: We have now 
reached the point of whether the United Nations will incorporate 
the promises made to us in Vienna into the 21 March document by 
editing the document. 
  Denktas stated that the Turkish Cypriot side will be able to 
see the future in a clearer way after the meeting with Feissel. 
  Answering a question on what will happen if the UN secretary 
general issues his report, Denktas said this is also a matter of 
luck. Asked if the Turkish Cypriot side is ready to negotiate 
should the document be edited, Denktas responded: We have never 
been the side avoiding talks. Therefore, if the document is 
edited and the promises made to us are realized, our people and 
our government will naturally be able to make a healthier and 
more positive decision. 
  In reply to another question, the president remarked that a 
special Republican Assembly meeting may be held in the next 
stage. The answers to various questions may be supplied after 
today, Denktas noted.

  [Text] President Denktas concluded his contacts in Turkey 
and returned to north Cyprus this afternoon. In a statement to 
the correspondents at Ercan Airport, he said that he had found 
an opportunity to make useful assessments of the latest 
developments on the Cyprus problem with the government officials 
in Turkey. Denktas said: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] We had an opportunity to assess in 
detail the latest developments on the Cyprus problem with 
President Suleyman Demirel, Speaker of the National Assembly 
Husamettin Cindoruk, and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. As far as 
I can see, we tend to agree on contining the talks if the rights 
and powers that have been gained at the Vienna talks are 
included in the document, dated 21 March, or if the inclusion of 
the gains in that document is accepted. However, the decision 
on the matter will be made by the Turkish Cypriot people. 
Turkey will support the decision we make, be it in favor or 
against. Considering the fact that not much time is left, I 
shall ask the Council of Ministers to meet and discuss the 
situation as it is seen from Turkey's viewpoint. If we can 
adopt a decision, then we may brief the political party leaders 
early tomorrow morning. Or, we may hold a joint meeting to try 
to adopt a decision. [end recording] 
  A correspondent recalled Greek Cypriot Leader Glavkos 
Kliridhis' statement that the process on the package of 
confidence-building measures [CBM's] has ended. Denktas said: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] The Greek Cypriots say that Christ 
is resurrected once every year. The package will not be dead as 
long as we do not both agree that it is so. Nor will the 
package be valid if we do not jointly say that it is. In fact, 
no agreement can be reached if we do not jointly reach 
reconciliation. It would be good if they realized that state of 
affairs. They have to reach an agreement with us for 
reconciliation and peace in Cyprus. 
  They may unilaterally say that the package is dead. Well, it 
is not dead. We are holding talks on that package. Gustav 
Feissel, the UN Secretary General's deputy special 
representative, informed us at our latest meeting with him that 
the UN officials would look into the matters we brought to their 
attention and would reply to the Turkish Cypriot side. How can 
the package now be dead? Talks are still being held on it. 
  We discussed the matter in detail with the officials in 
Ankara. It was observed that we had overlooked this or that 
point. I do not wish to expound on them. However, I wish to 
say that either an effort is made in good faith to achieve a 
result or the package is declared dead at a certain point. That 
is what Kliridhis has done. 
  No one can accuse us of delaying the matter. The past two 
months have been lost; it has been described as a delay. How 
was that period lost? It was lost because they [UN officials] 
changed the CBM's package in Kliridhis' favor, regardless of the 
fact that Kliridhis and I had agreed to it right at the 
beginning. Considering the changes, we have tried to establish a 
balance. The process of establishing a balance caused a delay. 
Had they not changed the package that we agreed to at the 
beginning on the condition that nothing should be changed in it, 
we would not have lost any time in the process. I wish to 
reiterate that Feissel informed us at our latest meeting that we 
are right and that they will look into the matter. 
  Why did we hold talks in Vienna? They were reluctant to 
establish a balance in the package which they themselves had 
violated. However, they suggested that we should hold talks in 
Vienna. We went to that city. Why did they suggest that we go 
to Vienna if the results to be achieved in that city were not to 
be regarded as having strength and being valid? Why did they 
ask us to go to Vienna and spend funds if the results were not 
to be included in the package? Certain agreements were reached 
in Vienna. We have asked that they be included in the package. 
However, we have been informed that the UN Secretary General is 
holding his pen and is about to submit his report, which will 
blame the Turkish Cypriot side. Well, what shall we do? You 
must agree. To What should we agree? You must agree to a 
package that has shortcomings and has not been balanced. That 
is an injustice to the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  Therefore, Kliridhis has described the package as a dead 
document. Well, the person who has described it as a dead 
package is probably able to resurrect it if he wishes to do so. 
However, we demand that the matters agreed on in Vienna be 
included in the package. We shall be ready to continue the 
talks if these things are included in that document. If they 
are not included, then it is up to them to decide what to do.

  [Excerpts] [Albanian President Sali] Berisha provokes 
Greece almost daily with his treatment of the Greeks of Albania; 
the answer to this is that there are political and diplomatic 
measures that our country can take, and will take, if the 
provocations continue. This statement was made by Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou during an interview with a private 
television station. The interview was on national issues, for 
which Papandreou said there is a direction. He clarified: I 
think our positions and stance reflect the needs of our times. 
The prime minister also said that Greece's policy toward 
Albania is a policy of open doors, and clarified that we want to 
have good relations with Albania--on condition, of course, that 
the rights of the Greeks in Albania not be violated. He 
stressed that we plan to be very strict in this regard. The 
prime minister also clarified that representations have been 
made while the ambassadors of the European Union countries as 
well as Security Council members, especially Russia and the 
United States, were informed. The prime minister concluded: We 
are ready to proceed with other measures if Berisha insists on 
his unreasonable tactics. 
  Responding to a question on the issue of Skopje's [The 
Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] name, Papandreou 
clarified once again that our country will not recognize this 
ministate if its name includes the term Macedonia or any its 
derivatives. This is very clear, he said, adding: We have not 
budged from our positions. Papandreou concluded by saying that 
the negotiations and dialogue with UN Special Envoy Cyrus Vance 
continue. [passage omitted] 
  Responding to another question by the interviewer on whether 
he plans to succeed President Konstandinos Karamanlis in the 
presidency, Papandreou said: I am in active politics. That is 
what I know; and in my intentions and plans, active politics 
always come first. This is my answer: I have not changed. 
  Finally, referring to the issue of his succession at PASOK 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement], the prime minister said that 
he will not personally choose his successor. The party is 
organized, it has a constitution, a congress and it will make 
the decision, he said. I may express my views, he concluded, 
but I will not choose my successor.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today 
repeated Greece's desire to improve its relations with Albania 
and stressed that this improvement inevitably depends on respect 
for the rights of the Greeks of Albania. Venizelos stressed: 
We have legal political and diplomatic means at our disposal 
which we will use if we find ourselves in a position to do so. 
The international community and Albanian Government know very 
well what these means are, he said. 
  The spokesman made the above statement when he was asked by 
correspondents in Thessaloniki to clarify Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou's statement made on Mega Channel to the effect that 
there are other measures our country can take if the Albanian 
side continues with the same stance.

  [Text] It is necessary for Albania to understand that 
Hellenism is not willing to back down on issues related to human 
rights, not only of the Greeks but of every minority, said New 
Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert following a meeting with 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today. Evert and Papoulias 
discussed the developments in Albania and Evert's upcoming visit 
to Romania, which will take place next Tuesday. 
  Foreign Minister Papoulias described such meetings as 
helpful 
and said that he plans to invite the other political party 
leaders to briefings on the situation prevailing in Albania and 
other national developments. Replying to a question regarding a 
statement Evert made yesterday that there will be a collision 
between Greece and Albania if the persecution of the Greek 
minority continues, Papoulias said that there will be a conflict 
situation at the political and diplomatic levels. Papoulias 
also said that he will contact the UN secretary general today 
and send a letter to the U.S. secretary of state. In addition, 
Greece will appeal to the CSCE and Papoulias will have contacts 
with Mr. van der Stoul [CSCE commissioner on minority rights], 
who will be coming to Greece in the next few days. The Greek 
Government, Papoulias added, will ask for the support of our 
partners in the European Union [EU]. Ambassador Khristos 
Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry general secretary, today briefed 
the 11 ambassadors of EU countries and the ambassadors of Russia 
and China, which are permanent members of the Security Council. 
  Finally, the New Democracy chairman said that for the time 
being it is not considered necessary to hold a party leaders 
conference under the chairmanship of the president. 
  Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today that 
Greece is handling the problems with Albania, with which our 
country desires improved relations, with self-restraint and 
determination. However, without respect for the Greek minority's 
rights, Venizelos stressed, there can be no progress in that 
direction. The Albanian Government should take the Greek 
positions and representations into account. 
  Regarding Foreign Minister Papoulias' statement that if the 
Albanian provocations continue there will be conflict at the 
political and diplomatic level, the Government spokesman said 
that there will be an exchange of political and diplomatic 
representations because, in our opinion, Albania is violating 
international law. Venizelos said the Greek Government hopes 
that all political forces will join together on national issues; 
the meeting between Papoulias and Evert was a part of that 
effort.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias in an interview 
this morning [not further specified] launched an offensive on 
all fronts while warning Albania about the violation of the 
Greek minority's rights. Papoulias warned Tirana that Athens 
could stop the attacks against the Greek minority and described 
as unacceptable the position adopted by some U.S. officials that 
there is insufficient evidence of the violation of the Greek 
minority's rights. 
  The foreign minister did not rule out that [Albanian 
President] Sali Berisha is supported by circles outside Albania. 
He also expressed concern over, but called for calm regarding, 
the recent Turkish provocations in Istanbul. Mr. Papoulias 
announced an initiative by the European Union [EU] at the troika 
level in the case of Albania and pointed out that Greece has 
lodged representations at all the international forums. He said 
that he has sent a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali and to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
on the latest Albanian provocations. 
  Mr. Papoulias stressed that we are carefully guarding our 
borders and linked the problem to the economic support we render 
Tirana by tolerating the 400,000 illegal immigrants. He did not 
rule out that the Greek Government, using legal measures, might 
stop accepting illegal immigrants from Albania and increase the 
policing of the borders. 
  Greece's moderate stance should not be interpreted as 
weakness or retreat. We are moderate, but certain issues are 
not raised for negotiation, they are self-evident, such as the 
rights of the Greek Albanians. This statement was made by 
government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos when asked about the 
government's view of the latest developments in Greek-Albanian 
relations. Mr. Venizelos stressed that representations are 
continuing. He said that if Albanian provocations do not stop, 
our country is ready to adopt measures to guard the borders; 
these measures involve using police and customs guards, not the 
military. 
  Asked if the government intends to expel Albanian illegal 
immigrants following recent developments, the government 
spokesman stressed: The Greek Government would not hold illegal 
immigrants hostage to exercise its foreign policy because it is 
a country of justice. However, it is determined to exhaust all 
legal means.

  [Text] Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi made some 
provocative remarks from the floor of the Conference on 
Stability in Europe, being held in Paris. Serreqi spoke about 
the extreme nationalist stance taken by Greece, which is 
affecting the Greek minority in Albania and described the 
guidance, as he put it, given the North Ipirus citizens as 
unacceptable. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou, who met with 
Serreqi on the sidelines of the conference, reacted strongly. 
Papandeou protested the Albanian foreign minister's remarks and 
against the arrests of North Ipirotans. Serreqi denied that any 
arrests had taken place. 
  Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos and 
Papandreou 
described Albania's stance as paranoid. The Athens Television 
Network correspondent in Gjirokaster reports that more North 
Ipirotans were arrested last night and today, and were taken to 
court.

  [Text] Sotirios Kiriazatis, the president of Omonoia, who 
was forcefully brought in for interrogation yesterday afternoon 
by the Albanian police, was finally released this morning. At 
the same time, the Albanian authorities brought in for 
interrogation other immigrants, including Vasilios Bileros, 
Delvine's elected nomarch. 
  Yesterday, some Albanian newspapers and the state television 
published a forged letter attributed to Kiriazatis which he had 
supposedly sent in 1992 to Konstandinos Mitsotakis, Greek prime 
minister at that time, in which he supposedly thanked him for 
his help in Hellenizing North Ipiros. In a statement today, the 
president of Omonoia stressed that the letter published by the 
Albanian newspapers was forged and it was obviously intended to 
incriminate him. 
  At the same time, the Albanian Foreign Ministry yesterday 
launched an attack against Greece, saying that with its 
statements the Greek Government is trying to create another 
Bosnia in the southern Balkans. 
  In a statement to Albanian television today, President Sali 
Berisha claimed that he has a positive attitude about resuming 
the dialogue with Greece and stressed that the Greek minority in 
Albania enjoys all its rights. 
  It should be noted that the British newspaper THE GUARDIAN 
today reports that NATO has asked the Albanian Government to get 
rid of its nationalistic elements. 
  Our correspondent Yeoryios Kirousis in Gjirokaster has the 
following report: 
  [Begin recording] [Kirousis] The Albanian Government's 
provocations against the Greek minority in North Ipiros 
continue. The head of Omonoia here in Sarande, Sotirios 
Kiriazatis, was arrested. He was questioned for several hours 
by interrogators sent from Tirana and then was released. 
  [Kiriazatis] We are indeed going through difficult times. 
This is because there were mass interrogations, which cause a 
climate of fear, so to speak, and concern in general within the 
Greek community. What we can advise during these situations is 
to find solutions through good judgment. [end recording]

  [Text] Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias has 
announced that he has accepted an invitation by Cypriot Foreign 
Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis and will soon visit Cyprus. 
Papoulias made the above announcement following a meeting with 
Mikhailidhis in Athens today. During the meeting the two 
ministers exchanged views on developments in the Cyprus issue 
following the delay in the submission of the UN secretary 
general's report to the Security Council. 
  Replying to a question on the issue of the pan-national 
conference, the Greek foreign minister said that he discussed 
the issue with Mikhailidhis and added that the conference will 
take place at a time when it will be productive. He said he 
thinks that the situation that will result from the submission 
of the UN secretary general's report will make it imperative to 
hold such a meeting. Responding to a question about the 
possibility of the National Council going to Athens, 
Mikhailidhis said that he and Papoulias exchanged views on this 
issue and that it is just a matter of setting a date. 
  Both Papoulias and Mikhailidhis expressed the view that the 
delay in the submission of the Butrus-Ghali report causes 
concern and shakes the credibility of the process for solving 
the Cyprus issue. Papoulias also said that it is very important 
for the UN secretary general's report to reflect the actual 
developments. 
  Asked about Cyprus' application to join the European Union 
[EU], Papoulias said that during the EU Summit in Corfu the 
Greek presidency will propose beginning official accession 
talks. The Greek foreign minister said that he is certain that 
there will be steps toward that direction.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today 
in Thessaloniki that the Turkish claims that Greece give 
so-called help and encouragement to terrorism are close to being 
ridiculous. Venizelos made the above statement when he was asked 
by the MACEDONIAN NEWS AGENCY to comment on the new barrage of 
Turkish press reports and the statement by the Turkish Foreign 
Ministry spokesman on this issue. Venizelos said that the 
Turkish claims are an attempt to export Turkey's domestic 
problems. Contrary to Turkey, he said, Greece is absolutely 
open and accessible to everyone, so that at any moment anyone 
can check on the validity of the provocative Turkish claims 
about the existence of so-called PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] military camps in Greece. 
  Asked whether there is any link between the provocative 
statement by Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman 
and similar remarks by Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi 
yesterday in Paris, Venizelos said that Greece is following all 
these developments and trying to analyze various points; it does 
not underestimate any version and factor. The spokesman 
concluded that Greece is firmly and persistently trying to be a 
factor of peace, security and stability in the Balkans. 
  In addition, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas 
described the Turkish charges against our country as devoid of 
truth and totally unfounded. Bikas said that Turkey is going 
through a deep crisis in all sectors; it should search for the 
reasons for this and solve its problems with its domestic 
situation, socioeconomic shortcomings, and human rights 
violations. Greece wants to normalize its relations with 
Turkey, he concluded, but this depends on its stance on the 
Cyprus issue, absolute respect for sovereign rights in the 
Aegean and, of course, the suspension of the slanderous campaign 
against our country.

  [Text] There was a new provocation yesterday by fanatic 
Islamists against the Ecumenical Patriarchate at Fanari, 
Istanbul, on the eve of the conquest of Constantinople. An 
Islamic organization placed three powerful time-bomb devices, 
which fortunately were discovered and dismantled. The Greek 
Government reacted strongly through its spokesman. 
  Commenting on the placement of the three bombs at the 
Ecumenical Patriarchate and Ankara's claims about the so-called 
training of PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] members in Greece, 
Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said that the 
Greek Government is following the continuing Turkish tension and 
provocations with self-restraint. Especially on the latter 
issue, Venizelos stressed that Turkey's claims are close to 
being ridiculous, and called on the Turkish Government to stop 
exporting, as he put it, its political problems and respect the 
rules of Western civilization and international law. 
  New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert, who is touring 
Pieria, said that he does not consider the planting of bombs at 
the Ecumenical Patriarchate a serious issue, but described the 
statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman that Greece 
is training PKK members as suspicious. 
  Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras today said that 
the Turkish Government has an obligation to take all necessary 
measures for the protection of the Orthodox Ecumenical 
Patriarchate at Fanari. The knowledge that the Orthodoxy's 
unity is symbolized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate leads to 
extremist statements, along with the Kurdish issue which is 
dividing Turkey, Samaras stressed.

  [Text] Turkey has announced that the decision of the U.S. 
House of Representatives to suspend 25 percent of the security 
aid to Turkey does not serve the common interests of the two 
countries. 
  Replying to a question on the issue during his weekly news 
conference, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman said that 
the security aid constitutes an important dimension of the 
Turkish-U.S. security cooperation relations. He said: It is 
natural that we seriously assess any negative development that 
might emerge in this field in all its aspects. Turkey has 
always opposed the linking of U.S. aid -- which is supplied as a 
requisite of mutual defense and cooperation within the framework 
of the Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement -- to outside 
factors. Turkey, which has been faced with terrorism for years, 
does not deem it appropriate to link aid to certain conditions 
for unrealistic reasons and pretexts. 
  Ataman stressed: The suspension of 25 percent of the 
security aid by the House of Representatives as a result of 
allegations of human rights violations is an issue that must be 
assessed within this framework. 
  Ataman concluded by saying: We hope that a more responsible 
attitude will be adopted to eliminate this injustice in the 
future stages of the foreign aid bill as it goes through the 
U.S. Congress.

  [Text] [Announcer] The dispute arising from the decision of 
the U.S. House of Representatives to attach conditions to and 
cut the aid to Turkey is continuing. Ankara considers the 
decision unacceptable, and the view that we should reject all 
the aid is gaining ground. 
  The lack of lobbying activity by Turkey also had its effect 
on the decision of the House of Representatives. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Yesterday the House of 
Representatives decided to put conditions on the aid requested 
for Turkey by the Administration and cut it by 25 percent. The 
southeastern problem and Cyprus were put forward as conditions. 
  The decision of the House of Representatives will also be 
discussed in the U.S. Senate. If the Senate also approves the 
decision, then the whole thing will depend on the signature of 
U.S. President Clinton. 
  There was a reaction in Ankara against the decision of the 
House of Representatives. Rejection of all the aid is gaining 
ground within the True Path Party-Social Democrat Populist Party 
coalition. 
  Lack of lobbying by Turkey in the U.S. Congress also played 
a 
role in the decision of the House of Representatives. Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller cancelled the agreements with firms 
engaged in lobbying for Turkey. At present, there is no firm in 
the U.S. lobbying for Turkey.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has declared that 
linking the U.S. military aid extended to Turkey to human 
rights, the antiterror struggle, and the Cyprus issue is 
extremely irrelevant. Ciller announced that following the U.S. 
Congressional decision on the subject, Turkey will reassess the 
aid issue and if necessary will reject it. 
  Ciller, who is currently in Boston in the United States, 
conducted a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. Ciller reported that the conversation focused on 
various issues concerning the two countries. Ciller said that 
she told Clinton that the Turkish people will find it difficult 
to understand the Congressional decision to suspend 25 percent 
of the foreign aid earmarked for Turkey for 1995. 
  The prime minister explained that during the telephone 
conversation she stressed that linking U.S. aid to human rights, 
the antiterror struggle, and the Cyprus problem is extremely 
irrelevant to the issue. Ciller said: I informed Mr. Clinton 
that I will reassess the aid issue and if necessary reject it. 
The President, in turn, related that he will undertake all the 
necessary initiatives and expressed the hope that he will obtain 
results on the matter. 
  According to Ciller, Clinton said: You can tell the Turkish 
people that the U.S. Administration regards this issue with 
equal sensitivity. Ciller also expressed the hope that Clinton 
will undertake initiatives on the subject of aid.

  [Text] Ankara, May 27 (A.A.) -- Deputy Prime Minister 
Murat Karayalcin described the decision of the U.S. House of 
Representatives to slash by 25 percent the 453 million U.S. 
dollars in military aid to Turkey as being `regrettable and 
unjust.' 
  He told a press conference today that Turkey did not need 
U.S. ultimatums to practice human rights and implement 
democratic freedoms. 
  Evaluating the House's Wednesday decision which also asked 
Turkey to review its human rights practices and improve the 
situation regarding Cyprus, Karayalcin said that the government 
was spending efforts to establish human rights and freedoms in 
Turkey and a recent democratization package aimed to improve 
these in Turkey. 
  `Turkey does not need another country's ultimatum to defend 
human rights in the country and it is capable of improving such 
issues within its own dynamics,' Karayalcin said. 
  `These kinds of preconditions draw angry reactions,' he 
said.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has announced that the 
IMF will contribute $713 million to Turkey within the framework 
of the stand-by agreement. Ciller, who is currently in the 
United States, declared that the report drafted by the IMF 
delegation that visited Turkey at the beginning of the month was 
approved by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus. According 
to information supplied by the Prime Minister's Press Center, 
Ciller issued the following statement on the subject: 
  IMF Director Michel Camdessus called me today and informed 
me 
that he has approved the report of the IMF delegation that 
visited Turkey at the beginning of this month. Accordingly, the 
IMF will extend $713 million to Turkey within the framework of 
the stand-by agreement. Camdessus' decision on this matter will 
be put into effect by the IMF board of governors, which will 
convene at the beginning of July. 
  The statement made by the IMF today is pleasing. Firstly, 
the negotiating process with the IMF was concluded at a fast 
rate. Secondly, as will be noted in Mr. Camdessus' statement, 
the IMF finds the economic program which was announced and 
effected by the Turkish Government on 5 April very 
comprehensive, realistic, and solid. The $713 million 
contribution to be received from the IMF within the stand-by 
agreement constitutes the maximum amount Turkey can receive from 
this organization. This, in turn, is a significant indication 
of the international support accorded to our program. The most 
important aspect of the IMF statement, in my view, is the fact 
that the program, which was prepared and effected by the Turkish 
Government itself, was endorsed without any argument. In other 
words, the IMF has fully approved our formula for the recovery 
of the Turkish economy. With the implementation of this 
program, Turkey will occupy the position it deserves among the 
strongest economies of Europe.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin left for Paris today 
to attend the opening conference of the European Stability Pact. 
In a predeparture statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Cetin 
said that the proposal concerning the European Stability Pact 
was submitted by the new French Government and was then 
transformed into a joint European Union [EU] initiative. Cetin 
explained that the guiding idea behind this initiative consists 
of resolving the minority and border problems lying at the basis 
of the instabilities in Europe through negotiations. He 
stressed that some of the Central and East European countries 
are still afflicted with minority and border problems. 
  [Begin Cetin recording] One cannot say that the initiative 
was welcomed by the relevant countries. Although this was not 
explicitly stated, these countries are being told the following: 
You have a European perspective, but we do not want you to bring 
your problems into the EU. You must first try to solve these 
problems among yourselves. We are willing to assist you to this 
end, establish a security system, and support you. First and 
foremost, however, you must discuss the minority and border 
problems. Conduct bilateral negotiations and reach agreements, 
or establish regional and multilateral platforms of negotiation. 
[end recording] 
  The foreign minister explained that an opening document will 
be adopted in Paris in connection with this issue. The document 
will outline the initiative's philosophy and its principal 
parameters, Cetin reported. He added that Turkey is ready to 
make every possible constructive contribution to the initiative.

  [Text] Paris (AA) -- Sitki Uluc reports -- Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin who is in Paris for the European Stability 
Pact Conference has concluded his bilateral contacts. 
  This morning, Cetin met with Aremnian Deputy Foreign 
Minister 
Gerard Libaridyan [as received]. After the meeting, Cetin told 
the press: "I had the impression that the Armenians have 
realized the importance of peace." 
  During the meeting, Libaridyan briefed Cetin on the latest 
developments and said that with Azerbaijan they "have arrived to 
a point that is very close to peace." 
  Cetin said to him: "You are waging a meaningless war. At 
this day and age nobody will allow the occupation of a country's 
land. You must reach a solution peacefully. The war hurts both 
sides extensively. We will extend every kind of support for 
peace. Do not seek solutions outside the CSCE framework. 
  Cetin and Libaridyan agreed that seeking solutions to the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict in too many ways and through 
various channels makes the solution even more difficult to 
reach. They also agreed that "Russia's support is essential for 
a solution." 
  Cetin gave Libaridyan the message that "the relations 
between 
Turkey and Armenia cannot be normalized as long as Azeri 
territory is under occupation." 
  Discussing his bilateral meeting with French Foreign 
Minister 
Alain Juppe, Cetin said: "I thanked France for showing 
understanding and supporting our struggle against terrorism." 
  Juppe discussed the consternation being caused by the 
failure 
to reach a solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina and stated that closer 
cooperation is necessary with Turkey in this respect. 
  Cetin pointed out that France can pressure Armenia so that 
peace can be established in the Caucasus, adding: "The solution 
must be within the CSCE framework. This war can end with the 
concrete support of the Western countries." 
  Discussing Turkey's problems in connection with the Iraqi 
pipeline, Cetin asked for Paris' support to rescue the pipeline 
in which Turkey invested considerably. Cetin pointed out that 
Turkey does not intend to violate UN resolutions, but that there 
is no need for a new UN Security Council resolution in 
connection with this matter which is technical in nature. 
  Cetin pointed out that France will be the term president of 
the European Union when Turkey joins the customs union, adding: 
"we will expect your concrete support." 
  Cetin also briefed Juppe on the latest developments 
regarding 
Cyprus. 
  At his meeting with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Peter 
Tarnoff [title as received], Cetin criticized the decision to 
link aid to Turkey to certain conditions and to reduce it. He 
termed this as "a negative development." 
  Cetin stressed that "Turkey is being subjected to unjust 
criticism as a result of wrong and insufficient information." 
He added that everyone must refrain from harming Turkish-U.S. 
relations. 
  Cetin pointed out that the United States can be more 
effective in the Caucasus. He also raised the issue of the 
Iraqi pipeline and discussed Turkey's problems and demands in 
connection with that issue. 
  Tarnoff stressed that the U.S. President attaches great 
importance to relations with Turkey, and that efforts will be 
made to prevent the relations from being harmed and to explain 
the facts. 
  Cetin criticized Belgium for allowing DEP [Democracy Party] 
to open a "solidarity bureau" there. He said: "Nobody should 
support terrorism. This is what international agreements and 
responsibilities say. Terrorism should not be tolerated. This 
is a very sensitive issue. Turkey's issues and problems are 
resolved in Turkey. Seeking solutions outside will not help. 
Such steps cannot be of any use." 
  Cetin returns to Turkey today.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, who represented 
Turkey at the European Stability Pact conference in Paris, has 
declared that Turkey believes in the benefit of the newly 
forming European Stability Pact and is ready to contribute to it 
in any possible way if requested. Cetin returned to Turkey 
tonight after attending the opening of the conference. 
  In a statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Cetin said that 
the opening conference of the European Stability Pact, which 
turned into a joint European Union [EU] initiative at the last 
minute, was extremely beneficial as a result of the 
participation of some 40 countries. The ineffectiveness of the 
security organizations in the face of the tragedies in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina played a role in the emergence of the idea 
for a stability pact in Europe, Cetin remarked. He noted that 
the essential approach of this idea consists of preventive 
diplomacy. Stressing that the pact is aimed at resolving the 
problems among the Baltic countries, Romania, and Bulgaria 
without carrying them over into the EU, Cetin reported that two 
documents were issued at the end of the conference. The foreign 
minister continued: 
  [Begin Cetin recording] At this stage, we must not make 
definitive statements about the role, contribution, or 
participation of countries like Turkey which are not directly 
targeted by the European Stability Pact. I would like to note 
that in addition to Turkey and Russia, Ukraine, the United 
States, and Canada fall into this category. We declared that if 
requested, we are ready to make every possible contribution to 
this process. [end recording] 
  Cetin explained that the Bosnia-Herzegovina tragedy has not 
actually ended yet and stressed that the creation process of the 
European Stability Pact must be rid of the impression that the 
perpetrators of the policy of ethnic cleansing will be allowed 
to profit from their actions. 
  Cetin said that during the conference he held very useful 
talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on regional and 
international issues and discussed the measures that must be 
adopted to end the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict with the 
Armenian deputy foreign minister. Cetin concluded by saying 
that in his meeting with the U.S. assistant secretary of state 
he declared that the decisions adopted by the U.S. Congress are 
the product of erroneous assessments and are not welcomed by 
Turkey.

  [Text] Ankara, May 27 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
Ferhat Ataman on Friday [27 May] said that United Nations 
officials have been contacted concerning the Turkish citizens 
who have migrated to northern Iraq. 
  Ataman said that they should be given refugee status. 
  Calling the issue a new deception plan, he said Turkey has 
repeatedly called for those who went there to return to Turkey, 
adding the state is ready to welcome them. 
  On the clashes between rival northern Iraqi Kurdish clans, 
he 
said Turkey is continously suggesting to both sides to end the 
conflict and that it is ready to welcome the leaders of both 
sides for agreement talks in Turkey. 
  Ataman said humanitarian aid by Kizilay (Red Crescent) to 
northern Iraq will continue in Dahuk and that because of the 
clashes those to al-Sulaymaniyah and Irbil have stopped.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that a new era 
condoning the changing of borders and the gaining of territories 
through the use of force will begin in the world unless the 
Azerbaijani territories occupied by Armenia are returned. 
Addressing a meeting in Ankara marking the independence and 
freedom day of Azerbaijan, Demirel expressed his views on the 
developments in the region. 
  In his speech, Demirel explained that the Azerbaijanis are 
trying, on one hand, to improve their economic situation, and, 
on the other hand, to recover their territories from the 
Armenians through the use of international diplomacy. Pointing 
out that the developments in this region concern the entire 
world in addition to Azerbaijan and Turkey, the president 
stressed that Turkey does not want relations based on enmity 
with its neighbors. 
  [Begin Demirel recording] We said to the Armenians: 
Whatever happened in the past, we cannot live in the past. If 
you want to live here, then you must improve your relations with 
Azerbaijan. As long as you are in conflict with Azerbaijan, you 
will be in conflict with Turkey. Moreover, if you are in 
conflict with both Azerbaijan and Turkey, then you cannot live 
here. [end recording]

  [Text] Ankara (AA) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat 
Ataman has said that the allegations to the effect that Turkey 
is a party to the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia "are 
legally and logically invalid as well as completely unfounded." 
  Karen Baburyan, the acting speaker of the Armenian 
parliament 
[name and title as received] unilaterally declared in 
Nagorno-Karabakh, told the latest issue of the weekly ROSSIYA 
published in Russia that "Turkey is directly involved in the 
conflict, and therefore, as a party to the conflict, must cosign 
any peace agreement." 
  Replying to a question on the issue by an ANATOLIA 
correspondent, Ataman pointed out that the UN Security Council 
and the CSCE resolutions clearly cite the parties to the 
conflict. 
  Commenting on Baburyan's allegation that "the fact that 
certain Turks participate in the fighting in Azerbaijani ranks 
as proof that Turkey is a party to the conflict," Ataman said: 
"It is impossible to find any proof that any officers or 
noncommissioned officers of the Turkish Armed Forces -- be they 
on active duty or retired -- are serving at the front because 
such a thing never happened. On the other hand, it has been 
proven that the Armenian Republic is actively involved in the 
fighting, not only through documents found on prisoners of war 
but by other findings as well."

  [Text] Ankara (AA) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat 
Ataman has said that it is long overdue for Greece to remember 
its international responsibilities regarding terrorism, for it 
to fulfill them without further delay, and to end the unfriendly 
policies it has been pursuing against Turkey. 
  Replying to a question during his news conference today, 
Ataman recalled the confessions of PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] militants who were caught after they came to Turkey 
to carry out terrorist activities. The militants said that they 
arrived in Athens from Frankfurt on 20 February, underwent 
terrorist training in a camp in Greece, and then infiltrated 
into Turkey from Meric river in order to attack tourist, 
economic, and military targets in Turkey. Ataman pointed out 
that these confessions were videotaped. 
  In the wake of this development, the spokesman said, Foreign 
Ministry Deputy Under Secretary Unal Unsal summoned the Greek 
ambassador to the ministry. 
  Ataman went on: "Ambassador Unsal conveyed the information 
to the Greek ambassador, told him that it is understood that the 
PKK is being trained in Greece and is receiving material and 
moral support in that country. Unsal asked the ambassador for 
information in connection with this matter and stressed that 
this is a grave development." 
  Ataman explained that after this meeting, Ambassador Unsal 
invited the U.S., French, British, and German ambassadors to the 
ministry and briefed them on this grave situation. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out that the 
requested 
information has not yet arrived from Greece. He stressed that 
backing terrorist organizations against Turkey will not lead 
Greece anywhere. He said: "Those who sow wind today should 
never forget that they will reap a storm tomorrow."

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has left for Ukraine, 
the first leg of his official tour to Ukraine and Moldova. 
  In a statement at Ankara Esenboga Airport before his 
departure, Demirel said that this will be the first visit to 
Ukraine and Moldova by a Turkish president since the two 
countries gained independence. He pointed out that Turkey was 
one of the first countries to recognize and to establish 
diplomatic relations with Ukraine and Moldova. 
  [Begin Demirel recording] Turkey attaches great importance 
to the strengthening of the independence of these two countries 
-- which gained their independence and took their rightful 
places in the world -- and to the success of their political and 
economic reforms. In particular, Turkey is trying to share its 
experience in the transition to a free market economy to the 
benefit of these friendly countries. In line with this aim, I 
would like to announce that the Turkish Development and 
Cooperation Agency will open an office in Moldova during my 
visit. 
  Turkey considers friendly Ukraine one of the most important 
countries in our region. [end recording] 
  Demirel pointed out that the approval documents for the 
friendship and cooperation agreement signed by President 
Kravchuk in Ankara in 1992 will be exchanged during his visit to 
Ukraine. He added that agreements on sea and highway 
transportation and on tourism will be signed, as well as a 
protocol on the Ceyhan-Kirikkale-Samsun oil pipeline project 
that will carry Middle Eastern oil to the Black Sea and Ukraine 
over Turkey. 
  [Begin Demirel recording] As you know, Crimean Turks live in 
Ukraine and Gagauz Turks in Moldova. These Turkish communities 
make up very important bridges of friendship between Ukraine and 
Moldova and Turkey. We attach great importance to the happiness 
of these Turks in the countries, to their living as free 
citizens whose equal rights are guaranteed and who can uphold 
their ethnic and social identities, and to the establishment and 
development of mutual understanding and strong cooperation 
between them and the local and central authorities. Our Crimean 
Turkish brothers in Ukraine were expelled from their lands and 
massacred in 1944 during the Stalin era. The 50th anniversary 
of this shameful incident of humanity was marked on 18 May with 
sorrow and contempt. The Crimean Turks are still trying to 
return to their historical homeland, the Crimea. Despite the 
help of the Ukrainian Government and its desire to make this 
return easy, the Crimean Turks are faced with serious problems 
in their return to Crimea. Turkey will try to be of as much 
help as it can to alleviate these problems. [end recording] 
  Demirel said that in Moldova, a series of documents will be 
signed that will constitute the contractual basis of the 
relations between the two countries. He explained that the 
agreements to be signed will cover friendship and cooperation, 
ground and air transportation, culture, judicial cooperation, 
and the struggle against organized crime. 
  Demirel announced that the Chief Consulate in Kishinev in 
Moldova has been raised to the level of an embassy. He said 
that he will inaugurate the new embassy building during his 
visit. 
  The president pointed out that in Moldova he will meet with 
the leaders of the Gagauz Turks and tour the areas in which they 
live. He added that he will lay the cornerstone of the brick 
and tile factory the Turkish private sector is building for 
close to $1 million in the Gagauz region. 
  Demirel was seen off by Turkish Grand National Assembly 
speaker Husamettin Cindoruk. Acting Prime Minister Necmettin 
Cevheri, Chief of the General Staff General Dogan Gures, certain 
ministers, and officials were present at the ceremony. Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin and Transportation Minister Mehmet 
Kostepen are accompanying Demirel on the visits.

  [Excerpt] Vienna, May 28 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] admitted failure Saturday [28 May] in its 
attempts to monitor the refuelling of a nuclear reactor in North 
Korea as Pyongyang defended the operation. 
  In Seoul the South Korean Government called on the North to 
stop the controversial refuelling at the five-megawatt Yongbyon 
reactor, warning that the situation could degenerate into a 
crisis. 
  The IAEA issued a statement confirming that North Korea had 
refused to allow its inspectors to check that no fuel was being 
diverted to make nuclear weapons. 
  "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) rejected 
all IAEA proposals put forward with the aim of maintaining the 
IAEA's ability to select, segregate and secure fuel rods for 
later measurements so as to be able to verify the history of the 
reactor core, specifically to verify whether this is the first 
core," the statement said. 
  "The DPRK continued to maintain that it could not accept the 
IAEA verification measures proposed." 
  It said two senior Agency members who had travelled to North 
Korea would return to Vienna Saturday, but that two other 
inspectors would remain behind to further developments. 
  IAEA Director General Hans Blix said earlier in a letter to 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that North Korea had 
resumed refuelling at the Yongbyon reactor, defying the 
international inspectors and making it impossible to make a full 
accounting of weapons-grade fuel. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] A condemnation of violence and support for 
political dialogue and the economic reforms launched by 
President Zeroual's regime are the results of the brief visit to 
Algiers by the Greek, German, and Belgian troika of European 
Union foreign ministers. After he returned to Brussels last 
night, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes spoke to Quentin 
Dickinson: 
  [Begin Claes recording] It seems clear to me that if Algeria 
does not receive financial and economic aid from the 
international community, it will find it very difficult to 
overcome two challenges simultaneously: terrorism as evolved by 
the fundamentalists on the one hand; and public opinion, which 
in fact is suffering financially and economically from the 
consequences of the policy on structural reform. If we want to 
provide a social safety net, if we want to give a concrete 
signal to the people that something is starting to move and 
changing in the right direction, aid has to come from abroad. 
Otherwise, I really do not see how the Algerian Government can 
make its program successful. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vienna, May 29 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) has rejected a proposal to keep nuclear 
material from a reactor in North Korea "in a safe place, under 
seal" an IAEA source confirmed Sunday [29 May]. 
  Dimitri Perricos, head of the IAEA's team of experts in 
North 
Korea, who left Pyongyang Saturday, said in Beijing, "the North 
Koreans proposed a procedure which was not workable on a 
technical front." 
  IAEA experts here said storing the nuclear rods would not 
have allowed the agency to verify whether any had been diverted 
for the possible manufacture nuclear weapons. 
  "The only effective method of control is to immediately stop 
the downloading of the reactor and take samples from the nuclear 
rods," one expert said. 
  "The North Koreans have said it would cost too much to stop 
the downloading of the reactor." 
  Two IAEA inspectors at Yongbyon continue to observe the 
operations at the reactor. 
  The United States and IAEA officials have said repeatedly 
that they do not think North Korea has been using the 
downloading of the reactor to divert nuclear material to a 
possible weapons programme. 
  But they think the previous occasions, dating back to 1989, 
have been used to build up a stockpile of weapons-grade material. 
  "The only means of verifying that is to take samples which 
can tell us with certainty the progress of the nuclear material 
since the reactor was brought into service in 1986," an IAEA 
expert said.

  [Text] For the past 11 years a war has been going on in 
Sudan between non-Muslim rebels and the Muslim government. Over 
1.3 million people have died in this war, more than 3.3 million 
refugees have left the country. Some 300,000 have found refuge 
in Uganda. For [Ugandan] President Museveni this is a reason to 
work out a peace solution for Sudan together with Djibouti, 
Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Kenya. The bilateral talks in Muerzsteg 
[Austria] might have given a new impetus to the IGADD 
[Inter-Governmental Authority on Draught and Development] peace 
initiative. President Museveni did not release any details 
about the talks, probably so as not to endanger the dialogue 
with Sudan. 
  [Begin Museveni recording, in English with superimposed 
German translation] We have worked out a method to clarify open 
questions, including a peace settlement for southern Sudan. 
[end recording] 
  And Sudan's head of state 'Umar al-Bashir adds: 
  [Begin al-Bashir recording, in Arabic with superimposed 
German translation] In our talks we have agreed to improve 
relations between Sudan and Uganda and to remove all the 
obstacles to a peace settlement for southern Sudan. [end 
recording] 
  On 18 July in Nairobi, the African IGADD states, Sudan, and 
the warring factions of the southern Sudanese resistance want to 
meet for fresh negotiations. 
  [Austrian] President Klestil expressed satisfaction with the 
talks and he said that this proves that in spite of 
concentrating on the European Union, Austria has maintained a 
global outlook.

<F P=106> [Report by Josef Kirchengast: "Secret Meeting in Styria"] </F>
  [Text] Muerzsteg -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni 
spoke jokingly about a "white-brown plot." Under impressive 
antlers in the Muerzsteg hunting lodge, the Austrian president's 
summer residence, Thomas Klestil on Sunday [29 May] at noon 
shook hands with his official guest, Museveni, and Sudanese 
President 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir shook hands. 
  The extremely serious background of the meeting, which was 
kept secret until the last minute, was the civil war in southern 
Sudan, where the Muslim central government has fought against 
rebel troops for more than 10 years. The south, where 
Christians and believers of natural religions live, has resisted 
the policy of islamization that has been enforced by the north 
in recent years. In Sudan, the Muslim law, the Shariah, is in 
force. 
  According to estimates, between 500,000 and 1 million people 
were killed in the war. According to Museveni, there are 
approximately 300,000 Sudanese refugees in Uganda. All peace 
initiatives and mediation efforts, for instance in the framework 
of the IGADD (Inter-Governmental Authority on Draught and 
Development), have been unsuccessful. Members of the IGADD, 
which deals with the consequences of draught and development 
problems, are Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Kenya. 
<H5>  Excursion to a Mountain Pasture </H5>
  Museveni said on 29 May that the meeting in Muerzsteg had 
come about at the initiative of "friends in Uganda and Sudan." 
Al-Bashir had arrived at the hunting lodge on 28 May in the 
afternoon at the head of a government delegation, shortly after 
Museveni. Several rounds of talks were held, and they had 
dinner. On Sunday morning [29 May], the three presidents made 
an excursion to a mountain pasture. According to unofficial 
statements, the negotiations were very tough. 
  Al-Bashir told newsmen that there had been "productive 
discussions on all areas of bilateral relations." They had 
agreed to continue the talks within the framework of the IGADD. 
Museveni said agreement had been reached on the framework of 
the next negotiations. 
  In northern Sudan, which is primarily Muslim, the Shariah 
also applies to non-Muslims. In the south, al-Bashir's 
government has formally renounced this. Answering a question by 
DER STANDARD, the Sudanese president said: "It is a fact that 
the Shariah is not applied in the south. This could be the 
basis of a peace agreement." He said the West was launching a 
"negative campaign" against Sudan, and the West was uninformed 
about the real situation in the country. Klestil hinted 
subsequently that both sides had made "considerable progress" in 
Muerzsteg. Austria's federal state structures were to a certain 
extent viewed as a model. The next step should now be "to get 
the rebels to the table." 
  The southern Sudanese People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) is 
divided into two wings, the "United" under Riek Machar and the 
"Mainstream" under John Garang. Machar advocates full 
independence for southern Sudan. Garang has meanwhile also come 
closer to this position. 
  Museveni considers the secession of the south the "last way 
out," whereas his foreign minister, Paul Ssemogerere, says it is 
the "only solution."

  [Excerpts] Brussels, May 27 (AFP) -- NATO wants to give a 
quick answer to the proposals put forward by Russia before it 
will sign the Partnership for Peace (PFP) programme, NATO deputy 
secretary general Sergio Balanzino said Friday [27 May]. 
  "It's work in progress, it's a dialogue (with Russia) which 
becomes serious and intense and on NATO's side, we'll make our 
position known hopefully pretty soon," Balanzino said. [passage 
omitted] 
  Balanzino said: "We've taken good note of the Russians' 
intention to sign PFP as it is without any change or 
modification." 
  However, he was cautious on whether or not the signing would 
take place during a NATO foreign affairs ministers' meeting in 
Istanbul on June 8. 
  "These are things that need time and reflection. We will 
certainly be active and not wait too long before coming to a 
conclusion and define our position," Balanzino said. 
  "But I don't know if we will be able to reach a signature 
(in 
Istanbul). To dialogue with Russia is not a walk in the park. 
We've to be serious and take time," he said.

<F P=106> [Cristinel Popa dispatch from Oslo] </F>
  [Text] At the yearly spring meeting of the North Atlantic 
Assembly, which is taking place in Oslo, the attention focused 
today on the proceedings of the Political Commission, which were 
also addressed by representatives of the Romanian delegation. 
In the first part of the day, the head of the Romanian 
delegation, Mr. Ion Ratiu [vice president of the National 
Peasant Christian Democratic Party] made a speech on the draft 
report "After the NATO Summit," presented by the British 
delegate Bruce George. Basically, Mr. Ion Ratiu said that 
Russia should not be granted privileges to make it join the 
Partnership for Peace scheme, since this would allow Russia to 
go on fishing in East Europe. What is more, such privileges 
would facilitate its return to a policy of domination in the 
region, something which might affect the fragile stability 
established after the end of the Cold War. 
  In the afternoon, Mr. Petre Roman [president of the 
Democratic Party (National Salvation Front]) presented a draft 
special report entitled: "A Romanian Perspective on Creating 
and Strengthening the New European Security Order." The report 
aims at presenting a concept on the two questions raised after 
the Partnership for Peace initiative took effect. The first 
question is whether this initiative amounts to a closed door, 
for an indefinite length of time, to the countries wishing to 
adhere to the North Atlantic alliance. The second question is 
whether the Partnership represents a concrete prospect for 
expanding the alliance and enhancing stability in Europe. From 
a Romanian viewpoint, the first variant is inconceivable. 
Romania was the first country to sign the Partnership for Peace 
in January 1994. In the opinion of the rapporteur, the 
country's special geostrategic situation, the potential threat 
represented by the presence of Russia's 14th Army in eastern 
Moldova, the fact that the treaties of mutual understanding with 
Hungary and Ukraine have not yet been signed, and the tense 
situation in the Balkans are strong arguments for wanting to 
adhere speedily to the North Atlantic alliance. In Bucharest, 
the Partnership for Peace is not seen as a closed door. All 
political forces consider it as an important step toward the 
expansion of the alliance and hope that the current NATO members 
view it in the same light. Very concisely put, one can say that 
the Partnership for Peace offers a necessary time of reflection, 
not only for the United States and its NATO partners, but also 
for the countries whose security is very important for the 
entire European security system, namely Bulgaria, Czechia, 
Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, on the one hand, and 
Russia, on the other hand. In the rapporteur's opinion, Romania 
cannot feel secure until it finds its place alongside the 
Western democracies and becomes a full- fledged NATO member.

  [Text] Brussels, May 27 (AFP) -- Kazakhstan on Friday [27 
May] became the 19th country to join the Partnership for Peace 
program with NATO, with Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev saying 
it would help contribute to world peace and stability. 
  "This document responds to the interests of our country 
which 
strives for stability," the minister said after signing the 
document. "We do not accept any kind of confrontation or 
conflict." 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation program launched last 
January provides for increased military cooperation between the 
Atlantic alliance and former Soviet bloc states. 
  In response to reporters' questions, Saudabayev said his 
country, one of four former Soviet states to hold nuclear arms, 
along with Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, would continue sending 
nuclear arms to Russia for dismantling "after some technical 
questions are solved." 
  Kazakhstan up to March had transferred to Russia 12 of a 
total 104 SS-18 nuclear missiles for dismantling under terms of 
the START I Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. 
  At the signing ceremony, NATO Deputy Secretary General 
Sergio 
Balanzino hailed Kazakhstan as a signatory of both the START and 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying it was a "sign of 
your commitment to the reduction and elimination of nuclear 
weapons on your territory."

  [Text] NATO Secretary General Woerner has canceled his 
participation in the NATO foreign ministers' meeting, which is 
scheduled next week in Istanbul. In a letter to the 16 member 
states, which was published today, Woerner says that he is 
following his doctors' advice in not attending the meeting. 
After the summer vacations, however, he expects to be able 
fully to resume his responsibilities again. 
  The former FRG defense minister has been suffering from 
cancer of the colon since 1992.

  [Excerpts] About 40 European foreign ministers are meeting 
in Paris today and tomorrow for a conference which, in one 
year's time, is supposed to lead to a pact of stability in 
Europe. [passage omitted] 
  If diplomats call it the Balladur Pact it is because the 
idea 
of the conference was launched by the French prime minister. He 
hopes everything will be over by the end of this year, that is, 
before the presidential elections. The prime minister spoke 
about his project to Philippe Harbart: 
  [Begin recording] [Balladur] This project will be successful 
if, as I hope, all the countries involved sign agreements 
between neighbors recognizing their borders and guaranteeing the 
rights of minorities. What is required for its success is very 
simple. For some countries this means complicated problems. 
Some countries have minorities who speak the same language and 
live in many neighboring countries. This means there are 
difficult problems. But this is the criterion. Will we able to 
solve -- in one year, I hope -- border and minority problems in 
all the European countries, up to the Russian border? This is 
it. 
  [Harbart] Why is Bosnia not on the agenda? 
  [Balladur] As far as the former Yugoslavia is concerned, 
France has made many efforts, last year in particular. France 
proposed the harsher sanctions voted against Serbia. It 
proposed creating safe areas protected by UN soldiers. It also 
put forward the peace plan. France is the country with the 
highest number of soldiers in Bosnia. Really, no one can teach 
France lessons. We have carried out our duty and even more than 
that. Today, we French have the right to tell all those 
involved -- those fighting on the ground and the big powers -- 
that a peace plan has been prepared and it must now be adopted. 
Otherwise, France cannot keep such an important force in Bosnia 
forever. [end recording]

  [Text] President Francois Mitterrand received the 
delegations to the Conference on Stability in Europe at the 
Elysee Palace this evening. During his speech, the president 
pleaded for the creation of institutions capable of promoting 
peace and anticipating conflicts in the old continent. 
  [Begin recording] [Mitterrand] The system relies on the good 
will of states. A strong desire for bilateral or, if necessary, 
multilateral agreements is therefore necessary among countries 
which for centuries have been used to fighting each other, and 
which run the risk of seeing the unbearable order which reigned 
across Europe for so long replaced by a disorder which would 
soon be equally unbearable. 
  As no one wishes to impose his way, one must resort to the 
old principles of every civil, even civilized society, which are 
those of mutual consent. We must resort to dialogue, to 
negotiation, to treaties, to pacts, and to contracts. [end

<F P=106> ["Sto"-signed report: "Latvia Wants Guarantees"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 26 May -- Despite the agreement under 
international law with Russia on the withdrawal of Russian 
troops, Latvia is still concerned about its security. Speaking 
to this newspaper in Bonn, [Anatolijs] Gorbunovs, the speaker of 
the Latvian parliament, said that regarding this issue, the Riga 
government is counting on "support from West Europe and the 
CSCE." He said that Latvia had made "substantial concessions" 
to Moscow to stabilize the European security system. That 
involves, above all, the promise that Russia would be able to 
use the early-warning system radar station in Skrunda for 
another four years. However, the Latvians fear that in the 
future the Russian Government will be able to ignore the pledge 
to withdraw from Skrunda. That is why the Latvians would like a 
"guarantee" from the CSCE regarding the Russian promise of a 
withdrawal. Appropriate signals from the West regarding the 
upcoming ratification of the these treaties by the Latvian 
parliament, the Saeima, would be important. 
  The Latvian parliamentary speaker, who is on an official 
visit to Germany along with a parliamentary group at the 
invitation of the speaker of the German Bundestag, said that, 
despite Moscow's promise to withdraw 18,000 active soldiers by 
31 August, there was concern about retired Russian officers who 
wanted to continue living in Latvia as Russian citizens. The 
government in Riga, which is being advised on citizenship issues 
by the experts from the Council of Europe, is seeking to 
encourage Russian citizens to agree to repatriation on a 
voluntary basis. A foundation has been set up to assist those 
who wish to be resettled. So far, Sweden and the United States 
have contributed $2 million to the foundation. "It would be 
wonderful if all the countries who congratulated us on this 
gesture would...also participate in the foundation," observed 
Gorbunovs. 
  Schaefer, the Foreign Ministry secretary, congratulated 
Gorbunovs on the Russia-Latvia agreements on the withdrawal of 
Russian troops. They were the "expression of a policy based on 
readiness to reach a compromise and not on issuing maximum 
demands." The Latvian parliament should now seek to ratify the 
agreements as quickly as possible. Schaefer gave an assurance 
that Germany would campaign for the "rapid admission of Latvia, 
Lithuania, and Estonia to the European Union." The Federal 
Government hopes that with the beginning of the German EU 
presidency on 1 July, the free trade agreements between the 
European Union and the Baltic states will be concluded. During 
the German presidency, the "Europe treaty" should be implemented.

  [Text] Saarbruecken (DDP/ADN) -- Several Kurds were 
detained today in a large-scale police operation against the 
Kurdish cultural center at the old fire station in Saarbruecken. 
A Saarbruecken police spokeswoman said in response to an 
inquiry that the operation had been conducted on the basis of an 
arrest warrant issued by the Federal Court of Justice magistrate 
against a suspected member of the banned Workers Party of 
Kurdistan (PKK). Officers from the Criminal Investigation 
Office, the Federal Border Guard, and the Saarland police were 
involved in the operation. The Public Prosecutor's Office in 
Karlsruhe is responsible for conducting the investigations. 
  The executive committee of the "Old Fire Station" 
association, responsible for funding the Old Fire Station where 
the Kurdish cultural group, among others, is based, drew up a 
resolution protesting the police operation. A statement 
released by the association says that approximately 100 masked 
officers forced their way into the building wearing combat gear 
and with weapons drawn. They searched all rooms and detained all 
the approximately 50 Kurds present and took them away in 
handcuffs. At least one person was seriously hurt in the 
process. The Germans present were temporarily detained, but 
were released once their personal information had been taken and 
they had been filmed on video.

  [Text] The government of Silvio Berlusconi is facing the 
bitterest criticism, as far as foreign policy is concerned, from 
its partners in the European Union [EU] and from its neighbors 
in the former Yugoslavia. 
  The veto imposed yesterday by Foreign Minister Antonio 
Martino on the inclusion of Slovenia on the waiting list to join 
the EU provoked a bitter reaction from Slovenian Foreign 
Minister Lojze Peterle. He said it would be difficult to have 
good relations with Italy. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman 
was also harsh. He said Croatia was faced with a renewed 
Italian imperialism. 
  France and, above all, Germany support Croatia and Slovenia. 
However, the Italian Government prefers to concentrate on the 
positive aspects of the meetings Martino had yesterday. The 
minister stressed he had received an invitation to visit Croatia. 
  There is also the diffidence of the European partners 
because 
of the presence of members of the National Alliance in the 
government. On 30 May the welcoming ceremony for the minister of 
posts, Giuseppe Tatarella, will be boycotted by Belgian Deputy 
Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo, who said he would not shake hands 
with a neofascist. 
  Finally there is also great embarrassment in light of the 
forthcoming visit to Rome by President Bill Clinton. Because of 
his role as chairman of the Chamber of Deputies foreign affairs 
committee, Mirko Tremaglia from the Italian Social Movement 
could be invited to the luncheon scheduled to be held at the 
Quirinale Palace on 3 June. This promises to be the most 
delicate moment in the whole trip.

  [Excerpts] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Russian 
Liberal Democratic Party, is demanding millions of markkas in 
damages from Finns for defamation. Zhirinovskiy has accused the 
Swedish Theater in Helsinki of linking him with Hitler and the 
newspaper HUFVUDSTADSBLADET of describing him as "mad." 
According to Zhirinovskiy's representative, several other 
similar suits against Finnish newspapers and television programs 
are currently being considered. Marja-Helinae Peltonen reports: 
  [Peltonen] During his visit to Finland this spring, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy authorized his Scandinavian representative, George 
Paile, and his company to deal with articles and performances 
that Zhirinovskiy feels insult him. The first two claims for 
damages have now been submitted to Helsinki district court. 
According to Zhirinovskiy's representative, it is likely that 
several other court cases will be brought during June. 
Zhirinovskiy's representative says that the two claims 
submitted to Helsinki district court are the first court cases 
of their kind concerning Zhirinovskiy in the West. 
  One of the claims concerns the Swedish Theater in Helsinki. 
The first night of the play "Mein Kampf," directed by Dick 
Idman, was in February and the last performance has already been 
given, i.e., the play is no longer being programmed. 
Zhirinovskiy or his representative have not previously voiced 
their displeasure to theater director Georg Dolivo. [passage 
omitted] 
  The other claim today is connected to an article in the 
newspaper HUFVUDSTADSBLADET written by journalist Jutta 
Zilliacus. The article that offended Zhirinovskiy was published 
in mid-April. Zhirinovskiy finds the word "mad" used about him 
in the article as offensive. The claims for damages in the two 
cases submitted to Helsinki district court total about 15 
million Finnish markkas.

  [Text] Robert Lamb, outgoing U.S. State Department special 
coordinator on Cyprus, has expressed the view that in his report 
to the Security Council, the UN secretary general will declare 
the confidence-building measures [CBM's] dead, and will 
criticize [Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas for this. In an 
interview with CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] 
correspondent Apostolis Zoubaniotis, Lamb said that he has the 
impression that the UN secretary general's report will be very 
harsh and that to all appearances, he will terminate this round 
of talks on the CBM's. The United States, Lamb added, will not 
waste its time if one of the parties is not interested in 
negotiating in goodwill. 
  According to our correspondent, Lamb who would have retired 
at the end of May, was asked to remain in his duties for one 
more week. Our correspondent also reports that in the next 
couple of days the State Department leadership will make known 
its position on the developments in the Cyprus issue. According 
to a U.S. official, very few expect Denktas to give a positive 
answer on the CBM's.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou by Notis </F>
Papadhopoulos; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Papadhopoulos] Let us now get 
into the international issues. Do you believe that even if our 
economy gets back on track, Greece will be able to play a 
decisive role in the Balkans at a time when its "fronts" with 
Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] and 
Albania are sensitive? 
  [Papandreou] You are right. We have problems at the present 
time. Your question is very correct. Indeed, Greece is a lot 
more advanced in the economic area than all other Balkan 
countries--it is a member of the European Union, has a business 
world with proven capabilities at the international level, and 
its prospects are indeed bright. However, in the short term we 
have problems that, to a certain degree, throw shadows on our 
expectations and hopes. They include the climate of conflict 
which has developed between Albania and Greece and of course the 
problem with Skopje. It would have been very good if these did 
not exist; we would have been absolutely free in our moves to 
have us, the peoples of the Balkans, all proceed together in a 
new direction of progress and economic cooperation. 
Unfortunately, these two thorns indeed exist. 
  [Papadhopoulos] Can we take these issues one at a time in 
order to see what we could do in each of the two cases? 
  [Papandreou] Regarding the issue of Albania, it is clear 
that the provocations are intentional. The violations of the 
human rights of the Greek minority of Albania are very obvious 
and unacceptable. Our policy, even during the previous PASOK 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government, was one of "open 
doors" toward Albania. We do not have anything to divide. We 
ask and demand that the handling of the Greek minority be 
consistent with human rights. 
  [Papadhopoulos] Do you feel that Berisha's regime is trying 
to kick out the Greeks from their homeland in North Ipirus? 
  [Papandreou] Albania's policy does not seem to be totally 
autonomous. However, I cannot say with certainty what forces 
may be using Albania. 
  [Papadhopoulos] Do you mean that these forces may be from 
outside the Balkans? 
  [Papandreou] Of course, clearly. What is obvious, is that 
Albania's policy appears to be an effort to kick Albania's 
Greeks out of their homes, either to Greece or elsewhere in 
Albania so that there will no longer be any contact by the 
Greeks of Albania with what we call North Ipirus. 
  [Papadhopoulos] Are there large settlements stretching from 
northern Albania to the south? 
  [Papandreou] They are exactly settlements. As a result, 
there is a policy of breaking their ties to a geographic area, 
if you will, and destroying the identity of the Greeks of 
Albania. This is unacceptable to us. Of course we are in a 
position to take measures of our own, but we would prefer not 
to. We would prefer to follow a policy in accordance with the 
established world criteria of human rights and stop the attempt 
at demographic and geographic adulteration of the Greeks. There 
have been many representations; we have talked to Russia, and 
the United States, and to Europe, and of course we are in a 
position to respond both politically and diplomatically. 
  [Papadhopoulos] During your interview with Mega Channel 
[television], you inferred that we are ready to make other moves 
as well. Do you mean, for example, closing the border and 
controlling the traffic flow? Do you mean to control who enters 
and leaves? Do you intend to heighten control so that fewer 
illegal immigrants come to Greece? 
  [Papandreou] This is also included. The only thing we did 
not mention is military action. This is clear. 
  [Papadhopoulos] Let us go on to the issue of Skopje. A few 
days ago, speaking to members of PASOK's Executive Bureau, you 
expressed certain optimism over the Skopje issue. 
  [Papandreou] Of course there is the issue of Skopje, which 
indeed is an obstacle in our acting as a significant factor in 
the Balkans; and I hope--I believe everyone hopes--that this 
wound will heal. Yes, I expressed optimism, but I do not want 
to get into details because the dialogue with [UN Special Envoy 
Cyrus] Vance and [U.S. Special Presidential Envoy Matthew] 
Nimetz continues. I would say that there has been a U.S. 
contribution to this dialogue, but I can not make predictions 
and nor do I want to get into details. I should not. However 
I have hopes, let us put it like that, that the problem will be 
overcome in a short time. 
  [Papadhopoulos] Does this mean that you believe it can 
happen even before [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's elections 
in October? Before the end of this year? 
  [Papandreou] I do not rule it out. However, I do not want 
to imply a climate of optimism, euphoria, that the problem has 
been solved. There is a problem and it still remains; and of 
course our positions are very well known; there is no need to 
repeat them. At this point I should say that the issue of 
Skopje had been buried when we took over. There were 
international recognitions of it every day under the name FYROM 
[as published in English] or "Republic of Macedonia." We simply 
waited until the recognitions, the catalogue, ended. However, 
we overturned this completely with our action and the 
implementation of the embargo. I think it was a critical 
decision. Of course, I knew the reaction it would cause. When 
one fights for his national interests, it is strange to see that 
the solidarity he believed he would find from his partners and 
allies does not come automatically. 
  [Papadhopoulos] During the last couple of days we have seen 
a new attempt by Turkey to trump up tension artificially with 
Greece. They even claim that we train Kurds; and there are some 
in the United States who take these things seriously. 
  [Papandreou] You know that what they say--that we train 
Kurds--is very dangerous. When I visited Washington, I raised 
this issue during our discussion at the negotiating table. I 
raised the issue that Turkey continuously sends signals that 
Kurds are being trained in Greece for terrorist actions against 
Turkey. I want to say it now: Greece has a very clear position 
on this. There are two sides to this coin: Human rights and 
terrorism. We support the rights and the human rights of a 
minority, of the Kurds. But we condemn and protest against 
terrorism as a means of solving the problem they face. And in 
any case, there is nothing in Greece that would even prompt the 
suspicion that we have any such contact with the Kurds who live 
as free citizens in Greece. I raised the issue myself. Because 
it is one of Turkey's techniques to describe Greece as a country 
that helps terrorists, gives cover to terrorists, to back us 
into a corner with regard with our international public 
relations. What is Turkey trying to justify by raising these 
questions regarding our role? This is what we do not know yet. 
Consequently, it is clear that we should be very careful, very 
decisive, not only to deny but also protest this accusation by 
Turkey, which is an intentional move in preparation for 
something. What it is I do not know. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- A group of experts led by Walter 
Hohlefelder, chief of the Department on Reactor Safety in the 
Federal Environment Ministry, left for Ukraine on 30 May to 
prepare steps for closing down the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. 
Two reactor blocs of the power plant are currently still in 
operation, while the third one was closed down following a fire. 
  The experts are primarily developing a concept for gradually 
closing down the whole reactor, setting up a second 
"sarcophagus" for the defective reactor, and ensuring an 
adequate power supply by completing reactor blocs under 
construction at three other sites in Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Article signed PLS/JMK: "Conference on Stability in Europe </F>
Opened"] 
  [Text] Paris, 26 May (BELGA) -- According to [Belgian 
Foreign Minister] Claes, "the Balladur Pact meets the 
requirements first because it is preventative, and second 
because the European Union (EU) cannot be enlarged without 
satisfactory guarantees regarding stability." That was how the 
minister explained his viewpoint to the Belgian press. 
  However, Claes questioned the future of this introductory 
conference. 
  Thus, the 39 foreign ministers will undoubtedly reach an 
agreement by Friday [27 May] on a (probably rather noncommittal) 
declaration with a view to initiating consultations regarding 
minorities and borders in Central and East Europe and the Baltic 
countries. "However, supplements on working methods are still 
open to ratification." 
  Consequently, the approach initially aimed at, namely 
bilateral talks, has been dropped, meaning that the planning 
partially escapes the inspection of those taking the initiative. 
  Moreover, according to Claes, "there are still problems with 
the two round tables. Russia has still not promised that it 
will take part in the round tables on the Baltics. Russia feels 
that the Balladur Pact somewhat thwarts the CSCE activities and 
wants to give Max van der Stoel, the CSCE special envoy for 
human rights, free rein. On this, Moscow could be swayed by the 
United States with the argument that international politics is 
already developed enough. As for the other roundtable, there is 
still disagreement between Hungary and Romania on whether or not 
to allow the Hungarian minorities to take part in the talks." 
  "The most important thing is yet to come," Claes said. The 
upcoming EU presidents, France and Germany, namely, will have to 
work very hard at this.

<F P=106> [Article signed NN/NB/GA: "Conference on Stability in </F>
Europe -- Flavio Cotti Advocates Stability Pact"] 
  [Excerpts] Paris, 26 May (ATS) -- Federal Counselor Flavio 
Cotti expressed his support for a stability pact in Europe on 
Thursday [26 May] in Paris. During his address at the 
conference on stability in Europe, the head of the Federal 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) also reported that Bern was 
willing to contribute to the development of such a pact. He 
added that Switzerland was ready to meet any request to that end. 
  Flavio Cotti was satisfied that the initiative of France and 
the European Union did not aim at "introducing new standards and 
new regulations on the issues of minorities and borders. 
Besides, it initiates a process that will progressively 
contribute to the rapprochement of the peoples living on the 
continent." [passage omitted] 
  The federal counselor eventually said that Switzerland was 
ready to actively participate in any initiative launched within 
the framework of the stability pact. Mr. Cotti told the press 
that he was aware that the problems of the minorities in Central 
Europe could not be solved overnight.

  [Text] Paris, May 27 (CTK) -- Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec said today the Czech Republic would help strengthen 
stability in Central and East Europe as well as across the 
continent, and would take part in a Central European 
"roundtable" discussion if it embraces the whole spectrum of 
regional cooperation. 
  He addressed the Conference on Stability in Europe which had 
proposed the round-table discussion. 
  Zieleniec stressed the best way of solving the problems of 
ethnic minorities and borders was the strengthening of 
democracy, the free market economy, the law-abiding state and 
respect for human rights, the means which had been tested by 
Western countries. 
  On the other hand, the Czech Republic has always taken a 
critical stand on a "selective solution" to the above problems 
in the conference's final document, Zieleniec said. 
  He expressed the wish that "the stability pact" did not 
double the existing European instruments and institutions, 
particularly the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE) and the Council of Europe (CE) which, on the 
contrary, should implement it. 
  He pointed out that the Czech Republic had greatly 
contributed to the completion and final tuning of the final 
document's text so that it comply as well as possible with the 
needs of Central and East European countries. 
  Prague has welcomed especially the fact that these states 
are 
no longer presented as states haunted by a number of problems, 
but as clear candidates for membership of the European Union on 
the basis of "their own achievements," Zieleniec said. 
  He came out in defense of applying flexibility and "variable 
geometry" in European politics. According to him, the conflict 
in Yugoslavia has taught all Europeans a lesson -- it has made 
it clear that stiff Cartesian thinking need not be generally 
applicable in the current complex situation on the continent. 
  "In other words, I am not sure at all that the `Sarajevo 
optics' should be used in dealing with problems in other parts 
of the European continent," Zieleniec stressed.

  [Text] Paris, May 26 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic will not 
attach agreements on good relations which it has concluded with 
its neighbors to the future stability pact in Europe, Czech 
Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told CTK today. 
  Zieleniec, currently in Paris attending a two-day conference 
on the stability pact which opened today, said that the 
conference's final resolution would call on Central and East 
European states to do so tomorrow. 
  Zieleniec explained that the Czech Republic had similar 
agreements will all its neighboring countries and their 
inclusion in the pact was voluntary. 
  He protested against the Western countries' apparent 
tendency 
to present the crisis in the former Yugoslavia as the reason for 
holding the conference. "I see it as a great simplification 
where Sarajevo serves as an argument and simultaneously the talk 
is about the Czech Republic. This logic has no place in Central 
European political thinking," Zieleniec said. However, the 
wording of the final resolution is generally acceptable, he told 
journalists. 
  Positive changes were to a great extent initiated by the 
Czech Republic which emphasized that "economic cooperation was a 
pillar of good relations and roundtable discussions should 
include economic cooperation," Zieleniec said. 
  Regional roundtable discussions should follow up the Paris 
conference resolutions and result in the conclusion of bilateral 
and multilateral agreements on good neighborly relations in 
different regions, Zieleniec said. So far six regions have been 
proposed, among them Central Europe and the Baltic. 
  Zieleniec said discussions should embrace not only borders 
and ethnic groups but also regional cooperation, economic 
cooperation and free trade. 
  Attempts were apparent at the conference that 
representatives 
of minorities participate in these discussions as well. This 
demand was raised by Hungarians living in Romania and Hungary 
supported it, Zieleniec said, considering it unlikely that the 
conference would agree with this. 
  He went on to say that the stability pact was not a pact in 
the legal sense or an international norm, but a "political 
process which is acceptable and natural." 
  The Czech Republic's attitude is reflected to a great extent 
in the words of the former presidential office head Karel 
Schwarzenberg published by today's French paper LE FIGARO who 
said that in the part of Europe to which the stability pact 
would apply "prejudices are deeply rooted and feelings have deep 
historical connections." 
  The conference organizers are not familiar with the problems 
in this part of Europe, Schwarzenberg said. They did not 
realize either that discussing "our intimate problems" could 
result in the "opening of new Pandora's box." 
  "Can you imagine a roundtable discussion in a 
Basque-inhabited region in France dealing with Basque and Irish 
problems in France, Spain, Britain and Ireland indulgently 
observed by Czechs and Americans?" asks Schwarzenberg in the 
paper, and replies with a definite "No."

  [Text] Paris, May 27 (BTA) -- "Bulgaria sees its 
participation in the Stability Pact for Europe as a means of 
integrating into the political and economic structures of 
Europe," Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said in 
his address at the Conference on Stability in Europe. 
  Mr. Daskalov said that stability is a complex problem that 
entails the overcoming of the economic difficulties some 
European countries are facing in the period of transition to a 
market economy, a Foreign Ministry spokesman told the national 
radio. The development of regional cooperation in a variety of 
spheres should therefore be an issue of priority within the 
framework of the process now being launched. 
  The Bulgarian foreign minister also said that the Stability 
Pact for Europe should be committed to the principles and norms 
of international law. All issues pertaining to minorities and 
European borders should be addressed on the basis of 
inviolability and respect for the existing borders, the 
territorial unity and sovereignty of the states and respect for 
the human rights of each individual, including those belonging 
to national, ethnic, religious and language groups.

  [Text] Paris, May 27 (BTA) -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister 
Stanislav Daskalov, who is attending the Conference on Stability 
in Europe, met with Peter Tarnoff, U.S. Under Secretary for 
Political Affairs, head of the U.S. delegation. The sides 
exchanged views on the need to intensify bilateral political 
contacts. They considered possible ways of expanding 
cooperation between Bulgaria and the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, of this country's accession to GATT 
in the near future, and international financing of transport 
infrastructure projects that would resolve Bulgaria's 
difficulties arising from sanctions enforcement against Serbia 
and Montenegro. 
  Mr. Daskalov also met with Latvian Foreign Minister Egils 
Levits to discuss prospects for the development of bilateral 
relations. 
  Mr. Daskalov met with G-24 Secretary General Jean-Claude 
Paye 
and the permanent representatives of the G-24 member states. 
The sides went into the prospects for deepening cooperation 
between Bulgaria and G-24 with a view to speeding up Bulgaria's 
reform process. 
  Mr. Daskalov and French Minister for European Affairs Alain 
Lamassoure discussed matters related to Bulgaria's speedier 
integration into the European Union and the prospects of the 
initiative for signing a European stability pact. Matters under 
discussion also included cooperation between Bulgaria and G-24 
and relaxing entry visa requirements between Bulgaria and France.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Main Points of </F>
Statements Made by Delors Following His Visit to Poland"] 
  [Text] European Commission President Jacques Delors ended 
his visit last week to Poland with a press conference in Warsaw, 
during which he expressed his view on future relations between 
the European Union and Poland, with a view to accession. His 
statements are summarized below. 
  1. Accession is certain and must be prepared. "During these 
meetings, I tried to clarify the European Union's [EU] position 
and its confirmed political will to open its doors to other 
countries, beginning with Poland, and especially to see how 
entry can be best prepared. This was the meaning of my visit. 
The inevitable preliminary is an institutional reform of the 
EU. We have the same institutions as those handed down to us by 
the Fathers of Europe, institutions which have no equivalent 
anywhere in the world. As Twelve, their working has become 
cumbersome; as Sixteen, it will be even more difficult. These 
institutions must therefore be adapted to a European Union of 
greater dimensions. This is not a pretext for not welcoming 
Poland. It is inevitable. How will powers be determined in a 
Union of 25 or 30? How can we reconcile the interests of a 
country with 55 to 80 million inhabitants and another with 
200,000 to 500,000 inhabitants? These are tremendous problems. 
How can a country that will join the family not have a say in a 
debate of such importance, which could condition for the next 
century the future of Europe and its influence in the world? 
This is why I have proposed that the Poles make their 
contribution in this area, not to leave today's architects alone 
while tomorrow the Poles will have to live in the house. 
Meanwhile, Poland must continue adjusting to new conditions. 
There is no need for new institutions to do so. We have all 
the procedures we need to work together." Mentioning the 
Baldwin Report -- which estimates Poland's entry as some 20 
years away -- Mr. Delors commented: "My general impression is 
more optimistic than the conclusion reached in this report." 
  2. Preparatory work, the case of agriculture. Mr. Delors 
commented: "Now that the Europe Agreement has been set in 
place, it must be made the principal means by which Poland is 
prepared economically, financially and socially for joining the 
European Union. This of course implies efforts on the Polish 
side, but also adaptation on the part of the EU, notably the 
PHARE [Program for the Economic Reconstruction of Poland and 
Hungary] programme. An economic strategy for accession must be 
agreed together. The Europe Agreement offers every possibility 
for development of a strategy to prepare the Polish economy for 
entry into the EC and for close political consultation. We now 
must simply continue our work, develop it seriously and help 
facilitate Poland's task. Of course, in the meantime, events 
can change. There are factors of agitation in Europe, there are 
attempts to extend European security, the CSCE, the Partnership 
for Peace, the Pact for Stability in Europe. I told my dialogue 
partners that I was very concerned about giving priority to 
security problems, given the dangers of destabilization existing 
in Europe, the most tragic of which is Bosnia." 
  Asked about the particular case of agriculture, Mr. Delors 
replied: "It is incumbent upon Polish authorities to determine, 
as part of their general concept of economic and social 
development, what they wish to make of their agriculture. For 
our part, and with a view to Poland's joining the EU, we are 
prepared to help them with our experience and know-how. We have 
already worked discreetly with experts to examine how 
agriculture as it exists in Poland or Hungary could be adapted 
to the modern world and today's conditions for the practice of 
agricultural activity." The President of the European 
Commission noted that there can be no united Europe without the 
presence of Poland, now that "we have returned to the 
geographic, historic and spiritual origins of Europe." He added 
that Poland also serves as a bridge between Europe and the Slav 
world, which can help prevent a split between Europe on the one 
hand and Ukraine, Belarus and Russia on the other. For his 
part, Polish Prime Minister Mr. Pawlak declared that Mr. Delors' 
visit had lent "dynamism" to work following on from his 
country's request for admission and noted that the problems of 
agriculture "will necessitate seeking joint prospects." Mr. 
Pawlak also insisted on the importance he attaches to the 
European Union's decision to develop major infrastructure 
networks and an information society.

<F P=106> [Ian Black article: "Britain Expels Iranian Official"] </F>
  [Text] Britain has ordered the expulsion of a diplomat 
from Iran's embassy in London but is keeping the move quiet in 
the hope that Tehran will not retaliate for the latest in a 
series of open rows between the two countries. 
  Iran's charge d'affaires, Gholamreza Ansari, was told of the 
decision on Thursday [26 May] when he was summoned to see the 
Foreign Office Minister of State, Douglas Hogg. 
  Foreign Office officials refused to comment yesterday on the 
meeting except to insist it was not linked to the fatwa calling 
for the killing of Salman Rushdie, the author of The Satanic 
Verses -- the main irritant in Anglo-lranian relations. 
  Iran's embassy also refused to comment. 
  The expulsion follows recent British charges that Iranian 
intelligence has been in clandestine contact with the IRA. This 
was denied by Tehran, which then made the charge -- 
conspicuously not denied -- that Britain's M16 had planted a bug 
in the London embassy. 
  Unusual secrecy surrounded the expulsion decision, and it 
was 
not clear whether it was related to the IRA row or to other 
bilateral strains. Suggestions of a Bosnian link were played 
down. Mr Ansari was told there was irrefutable evidence of 
wrongdoing. 
  Britain wants to keep the expulsion quiet to preclude 
Iranian 
tit-for-tat expulsions. Both countries are limited, by mutual 
agreement, to 15 diplomats in each other's capital. 
  Reticence about the decision stems from concern that 
publicity given to the IRA allegations last month was 
counterproductive, provoking anti-British hostility in Iran, 
including calls for a boycott of British trade or even the 
severing of links. 
  Relations between the two countries have been stormy since 
Iran's Islamic revolution in l979. Ties were severed in 1989 
over the Rushdie affair but restored in 1990.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister John Major by Chris Buckland; </F>
place and date not given: "How I See the Future for Britain in 
Europe"] 
  [Text] [Buckland] The 50th anniversary of D-Day takes place 
on June 6, three days before the Euro-elections. What relevance 
does one have to the other? 
  [Major] D-Day launched the liberation of a Europe that has 
twice this century been the catalyst for world war in which 
millions were killed. The advent of Europe over the past 40-odd 
years has meant it is inconceivable that there could be a war 
started in West Europe. 
  Their interests, their trade, are now so interlinked that 
the 
prospect of a war among them is quite impossible. So the first 
thing Europe has done is to give us 50 years of peace. 
  The second thing it has done is spread democracy. Portugal 
and Spain were run by dictatorships not all that many years ago 
and now they are both mature democracies. 
  I want to see the widening of the Community for several 
reasons. It will extend democracy, it will make Europe a better 
and safer place to live. That is one very direct lesson for 
D-Day. 
  [Buckland] How does this affect the European elections? 
  [Major] It is a long time since there has been such a sharp 
difference in European policy between that of the Conservatives 
and the Labour and Liberal Parties. 
  They are more inclined towards a centralist, federalist 
Europe that we do not favour. We are very much in favour of a 
deregulated, decentralised Europe. We want to cut down on 
expenditure they will increase the level. 
  We want to retain Britain's veto. They -- in the case of the 
Liberals quite clearly and in the case of Labour by subterfuge 
-- wish to diminish or wreck entirely the national veto. 
  I don't believe their policies are remotely acceptable to 
the 
British people and that is why they are determined to fight this 
election on anything other than European policies. 
  They want to treat British voters as though they were not 
entitled to a mature debate on Europe. We are not going to 
accept that. We are going to set out our vision of Europe in 
the future and expose the policies that they are trying to hide. 
  [Buckland] But it appears that some people want to vote on 
the Governments record, not on Europe. 
  [Major] I don't think people have appreciated the importance 
of stopping the sort of policies that activate Labour and the 
Liberals. The British instinct on Europe is that they recognise 
that our interests lie there. 
  They want Europe to be a success. They realise it is 
economically important for us but they are very worried about 
two things. 
  They believe Europe may be dragging us in a direction we 
don't wish to go and they can see that all across the European 
Union [EU] the people of Europe have lost affection for the way 
in which it has been developing. These are vitally important 
issues that need to be discussed in this election. 
  [Buckland] Generally voters only get a chance once every 
five 
years to exercise their democratic rights. Can you blame them 
for using this chance to send the Government a message? 
  [Major] No politician should blame the electorate -- they 
have a sovereign right to vote as they wish. I would simply say 
that we have to persuade them these elections are important. 
  Europe has been the poison in the well of British politics 
for a very long time. It would be a very great oddity if having 
aroused all those emotions people would then be persuaded to 
vote on matters quite unrelated to Europe. 
  [Buckland] Do you think it is time to rein in the powers of 
the Commission in Brussels to make them more like the unelected 
civil servants they are? 
  [Major] Yes. I think they need controlling by the European 
Council, the elected ministers of all the European nations. 
  [Buckland] What about the veto? 
  [Major] We have to cut down the amount of legislation, we 
have to deregulate and we have to pass more powers back to the 
individual states of Europe. 
  I believe the people of this country and across Europe will 
be much more settled when they are satisfied that Europe is not 
going to interfere with their culture and traditlons. I don't 
believe it will in the way people fear, but it must be clear to 
the people before the Union regains the popularity it once had. 
If we didn't have a veto on foreign policy that would mean that 
the EU could decide our policy on Hong Kong as far as China is 
concerned. That has nothing to do with the Belgians and the 
Greeks and Dutch, friends though they may be. And if we had not 
had the veto we would have lost the rebate Lady Thatcher fought 
for in the 1980s. That is worth 3 billion pounds a year to the 
taxpayer. 
  [Buckland] Do you expect to see a single European currency 
in 
your lifetime? 
  [Major] I plan to live a very long time. I do not see a 
single currency for a very long time. I'm not sure it will 
happen. 
  [Buckland] The next Inter-Governmental Conference is in 
1996. 
If there are changes in Europe of the magnitude of Maastricht 
surely the argument for a referendum is unanswerable -- if only 
for domestic political reasons. After all you will then be 
approaching a General Election and won't want the Tories divided 
on what may have been agreed. 
  [Major] If I think there is a deal that is not in the 
interests of this country I won't accept it. If I think there 
is, I shall put it to Parliament and expect support. I don't 
believe anv issues suitable for a referendum are likely to 
emerge. 
<H5>  Why We're Right Back on Track </H5>
  There is no gain without pain, John Major once told the 
nation. And his party is still suffering because of the voters' 
perception of the state of the economy. Here he explains his 
hopes for economic recovery turning the political tide. 
  [Buckland] Why is it taking so long for the gain to come 
Irom 
the pain? 
  [Major] We are getting the gain already, but it isn't 
apparent to people. 
  A couple of years ago, we had inflation at double figures -- 
it is now below 3 per cent. We had interest rates at 15 per 
cent, now down to 5 per cent, We had unemployment rising rapidly 
which is now falling quite rapidly. 
  In addition we now have exports running at record levels, 
production back to the peak of the late 80s. All that has 
happened, but history tells us that after a recession it takes 
some time before the good news filters through. 
  We have the best chance of sustainable growth with low 
inflation for as long as I can remember. 
  [Buckland] But people just laugh when you say the country is 
on the up and up. Despite all the statistics they think it is a 
joke. And they have just had big tax increases. 
  [Major] The tax increases arg a good deal smaller than many 
people imagined. Everyone said they were going to stop the 
recovery stone dead. They have not. We have had to do what is 
necessary to put this country on a consistent growth pattern and 
improve living standards in the medium and long term. 
  [Buckland] The economic prospects look good for the next two 
years at least. But how are you going to capitalise on that 
politically? 
  [Major] It is not quite so much one single big idea, but to 
ensure this country actually becomes more prosperous and that 
means better services across the board. 
  What concerns most people is the prospects that exist for 
themselves and their family. So what we need to do is to make 
sure we carry through the economic and other reforms to maximise 
the freedoms and opportunities of families. 
  [Buckland] Why muddy the waters with a highly unpopular idea 
like privatising the Post Office? 
  [Major] We are eonsidering that, but we are living in a very 
competitive world and need to be able to compete if we are to 
improve our living standards. At the moment British industry is 
the most efficient in West Europe. Our job as this recovery 
matures is to stay that way and make ourselves even more 
competitive. There is a world beyond West Europe, the Pacific 
Basin and the United States and we must beat them too. 
  [Buckland] Whose side are you on -- Norman Lamont's who says 
you should go back to Thatcherism with continual revolution, or 
do you believe people here have lost the stomach for painting 
pillar boxes a different colour and deregulation all over the 
place? 
  [Major] I'm in favour of common sense and will judge policy 
on the basis of whether it is good policy or bad policy and 
whether it is common sense or not.
