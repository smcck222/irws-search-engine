<F P=106> [Commentary by Mia Doornaert: "NATO Caught Between Two </F>
Fires in Relationship With Russia"] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will perhaps provide 
clarification at the end of this week regarding whether, and 
under what conditions, Russia is willing to join the Partnership 
for Peace (PFP). 
  Twenty states of the former East Bloc and ex-Soviet Union 
have already joined the PFP. On Friday [10 June] in Istanbul, 
Kozyrev will meet his colleagues from NATO and the other 
countries of the former East Bloc at the meeting of the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council. This will take place, in 
accordance with tradition, after the meeting of the NATO Council 
of Ministers. 
  Russia wants its entry to the PFP, greatly desired by NATO, 
to be accompanied by an agreement which recognizes its status as 
a major power, in the form of a special relationship between 
Russia and NATO. This point will be one of the major subjects 
of the Council of Ministers on Thursday. But in that respect, 
NATO is caught between two fires. All 16 member states agree 
that a good relationship between the alliance and the major 
power in the east of this continent is of the greatest 
importance for European security. 
  But at the same time, NATO must not give the impression to 
the countries of Central and East Europe, which regard Russia's 
ambitions toward its "near abroad" suspiciously, that their fate 
is being fixed without them being consulted, that they are in 
some way second-class states. 
  The relevant formula of British Foreign Minister Douglas 
Hurd, that the dialogue between NATO and Russia must be one 
"without vetoes and without surprises," has already been adopted 
by Russian leaders. Nevertheless Russia, which rejects the 
eastward expansion of the alliance, is using a kind of veto 
against the Central and East European countries pushing for 
membership of the alliance. 
  In any case, the alliance is also contributing to this. 
Various of its leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
have said that NATO "does not want to draw any new lines in 
Europe." From which Russia concluded that the old partition 
continues to exist in a lesser form. 
  While all NATO countries agree on the importance of a good 
relationship with Russia, attitudes differ regarding the 
question of to what degree this special relationship can 
overshadow the plans of the Central and East European countries. 
  The United States gives the highest priority to the best 
possible relationship with Russia. They want no initiatives 
which could destabilize President Boris Yeltsin and the 
government team of Vyktor Chernomyrdin. Just the fact that 
Russia has enough nuclear weapons to destroy the whole world 
makes it for the United States a partner which far outweighs the 
aspirations of Central and Eastern European countries. In 
addition, Washington is striving for the closest possible 
cooperation with Moscow in combating the spread of technology 
and material for nuclear weapons, one of the priorities of the 
Clinton government. 
  At the other end of the spectrum, Germany is now pushing 
less 
openly than in the past for the Central European countries, to 
start with, to join NATO as quickly as possible. But the fact 
remains that Germany does not want to remain the eastern border 
of NATO (and the European Union), that it gives precedence to 
integrating Central and East Europe in the Western institutions. 
  All this will provide new matter for discussion at the NATO 
Council of Ministers on Thursday in Istanbul. And as yet there 
are also no clear answers to the question of what form can be 
given to the special relationship between NATO and Russia. 
  NATO is a strict intergovernmental alliance. There is no 
question of its secretary general starting political dialogue 
with Moscow in the name of the 16 member states. Should there 
be NATO Councils of Ministers in which their Russian colleague 
participates? Or should there be special consultation about 
questions in which Russia wants to have its say? And what 
answer will be given when for example Poland, which has so often 
in its history been the victim of the ambitions of powerful 
neighbors, asks why Iceland is involved in dialogue between NATO 
and Russia over European security, but Poland is not? 
  These are all questions to which there is as yet no answer. 
The communique of the Council of Ministers in Istanbul will 
probably talk about "substantial dialogue" between NATO and 
Russia. But its content will remain vague and will also depend 
on the price wanted by Russia for joining the PFP.

  [Text] Our guest in the second part of this broadcast is 
Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes. He is a member of the 
European Union troika which has expressed its support for the 
economic reforms and political dialogue in Algeria while 
condemning violence in that country. This took place last 
Monday after a short visit to Algiers by the three ministers. 
Willy Claes therefore talks about the result of this visit to 
Algeria. The interview was conducted by Anne-Marie Mouradian in 
Brussels: 
  [Begin recording] [Claes] First, the government authorities 
as well as the presidency are firmly determined to continue the 
monetary and economic reform policy. Second, in order to 
establish a pluralistic democratic system where human rights are 
fully respected, they confirmed that they want to continue the 
dialogue with any political tendency or faction which expresses 
the willingness publicly to reject the use of violence and 
terrorism. 
  [Mouradian] Europe has expressed its determination to help 
Algeria to overcome the economic difficulties on which Islamic 
fundamentalism thrives. How is Europe helping? 
  [Claes] The European effort should be seen in combination 
with the activities and actions of other international 
institutions. As for the European Union [EU], we already 
decided a few weeks ago to grant the last instalment of a 
financial aid package to Algeria's balance of payments worth 
ECU150 million. Now we have realized that this is not enough. 
We are now waiting for a concrete proposal by the president of 
the European Commission to strengthen this aid to the balance of 
payments -- this could amount to ECU200 million -- as well as 
helping the social policy program which, with the job creation 
program, is the absolute priority of the Algerian Government. 
It would not surprise me if, within the next few months, the EU 
Council of Minister mandates the Commission to start 
negotiations with the Algerian Government in order to sign a 
partnership agreement along the lines of what is also being 
negotiated with the other Maghreb countries, Morocco and Tunisia. 
  [Mouradian] Mr. Claes, a recent NATO report stressed the 
rise 
of Islamic fundamentalism in North Africa, particularly in 
Algeria. Is this Islamic fundamentalism a major threat to the 
West at the moment? 
  [Claes] I believe that the EU is threatened by the rise of 
nationalism and racism on its eastern borders and by Islamic 
fundamentalism, which is fanaticism based on religion, on its 
southern borders. We should not underestimate this danger which 
is threatening us in Europe. Hence our responsibility to fight 
against this fanaticism by trying to work out social and 
economic answers. It is clear in fact that the fundamentalists 
take advantage of social and economic weaknesses to make 
progress and do away with democratic regimes. 
  [Mouradian] Isn't there a fundamental difference of approach 
between the United States and Europe? The Americans seem to 
have encouraged Algiers to negotiate with the fundamentalists 
even if this means their participation in government, while the 
Europeans seem to be more reluctant? 
  [Claes] First, this is not an official opinion of 
Washington. 
But I cannot deny that officials of different ranks have 
recently adopted positions in favor of this approach. I know 
North Africa quite well. I honestly think that this U.S. 
approach is naive, because embarking on such a dialogue requires 
partners. As far as I am concerned, I don't know where these 
so-called moderates are. I would say that the moderate 
fundamentalists were at the National Conference and are in the 
government in Algeria. Up until now, I have not been able to 
see anyone within the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], that famous 
movement, coming out as valid partners, rejecting extremist 
options and, above all, violence. 
  [Mouradian] A last question: Are there not differences among 
the Twelve? Is there really a common European foreign policy 
vis-a-vis Algeria? 
  [Claes] I am not sure if we can speak of big differences. It 
is true that some countries have always been more interested in 
a community Mediterranean policy than others. This is not 
surprising in fact. Having said this, let's be honest, there is 
not, as yet, a common foreign policy on North Africa. The 
Maastricht Treaty only came into force on 1 November last year: 
we cannot expect miracles. As you know, we have agreed on some 
common actions in the Middle East, South Africa, and in the 
former Yugoslavia. But I think I can say that basically, the EU 
Council of Minister unanimously agrees that the policy of 
economic and monetary reform absolutely must be supported in 
order to help -- in the case of North Africa -- the fight 
against fundamentalism. There are no contradictions on this 
matter among the Twelve. [end recording]

  [Text] Brussels, June 7 (AFP) -- Jacques Delors, chief 
executive of the European Union [EU], called here Tuesday [7 
June] for the creation of an economic security council to 
promote world economic stability. 
  Delors, president of the European Commission, said urgent 
action was needed towards "global management of economic 
problems." 
  He was speaking at the end of a three-day session of the 
Commission on Global Governance, a body comprising 28 men and 
women established by world leaders in 1992 to study global 
cooperation following the end of the Cold War. 
  Delors identified the growing swell of world capital 
movements as a particular threat to economic stability and 
sustainable economic growth. 
  "If the rationale of the capital market goes against the 
interests of the global neighbourhood, who can react?" he asked 
at a press conference. 
  Delors's answer was an economic security council comprising 
the United States, Japan, the EU, China, Russia and countries 
heading regional economic organisation in Africa, Latin America, 
Asia and the Pacific. 
  He proposes that such a council meet regularly with 
representatives of such institutions as the World Bank, the 
International Monetary Fund, the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade and the International Labour Organisation. 
  "We cannot go on talking about the global and the world 
economy without knowing how to tackle the problem," Delors said. 
  He stressed the need to take a global view of a world 
economy 
becoming ever-more unified, and to establish links between 
"trade, currencies, finance, the environment and polulation 
growth." 
  Delors said that the international capital market had to 
bear 
much of the blame for the current rise in longterm interest 
rates. 
  Co-chairing the Commission's meeting were the former 
secretary-general of the Commonwealth, Shridath Ramphal, and 
former Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson. 
  They said the meeting had also discussed a United Nations 
peacekeeping force to extinguish flare-ups of violence, and ways 
to make the UN more accountable to ordinary people and 
organisations as well as governments. 
  But Ramphal would not be drawn on what action should be 
taken 
to bring countries such as China into line with international 
standards of human rights. 
  "Good government doesn't need the suppression of one set of 
values in favour of another," he told journalists when asked 
whether the Asian drive towards economic development might clash 
with individual human rights.

<F P=106> [Article by "Sto.": "European Arms Agency Under </F>
Consideration--Cooperation With France; `Restrictions Are Not 
Being Circumvented'"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 24 May--The Federal Ministry of Defense wants 
to create a European armament agency with comprehensive 
jurisdiction, which is to decide on arms exports. The arms 
industry in the European Union [EU] is to be linked more 
closely; armament efforts are to be harmonized. The ministry 
hopes to save money through joint procurement. 
  A working paper of the ministry states that such an EU 
armament agency would make sense only if past and present 
national jurisdictions were relinquished. In the words of a 
spokesman, the paper reflects "initial thoughts" for 
negotiations in the "Western European Armament Group" of the 
Western European Union [WEU]. 
  An EU armament agency with corresponding jurisdiction could 
possibly circumvent the restrictive German export regulations. 
However, on Tuesday [24 May] the Defense Ministry emphatically 
pointed out that the aim of the consultations is "not a 
loosening of arms export regulations." It is still completely 
open how a joint EU arms export policy is to be shaped. 
  Negotiations in the WEU are to be concluded by fall. Since 
the Maastricht Treaty, the WEU is an "integral component of 
development in the EU" for defense policy questions. This 
subject is reserved for direct cooperation of the EU governments. 
  In the view of the German Defense Ministry, the future EU 
armament agency is to be based on "close defense policy 
cooperation with France." This is to provide "the European 
armament integration process with the necessary dynamism." The 
paper states that EU members, which are seen to be hesitant on 
this issue, initially should not be integrated, since a minimal 
solution without relinquishment of national jurisdictions would 
promise little success. Evidently the Federal Defense Ministry 
assumes that Great Britain, with whom many cooperation 
agreements exist, is not willing to give up the ultimate 
national decision on questions of exports. 
  The position paper, worked out in the Defense Ministry, 
proposes to amend Article 223 of the EC Treaty--which had not 
been changed by the Maastricht Treaty--during the revision of 
the Maastricht Treaty planned for 1996. With regard to present 
rules on competition, the article states that "each member state 
can take those measures which in its opinion are necessary to 
preserve its essential security interests, as regards the 
production of weapons, munitions, war materiel, or trade 
therewith...." The Defense Ministry now proposes that the 
armament agency advance the bundling of arms activities "through 
a mutual waiver by countries willing to integrate to cite 
Article 223 of the EC Treaty." 
  The Defense Ministry paper also states that, by establishing 
a joint armament agency, jobs would have to be sacrificed. But 
the productive German arms industry "overall will emerge as a 
net gainer" from unimpeded competition.

  [Text] The Nordic countries have undertaken to assist the 
Baltic countries in the establishment of their joint 
peacekeeping battalion. The countries' defense ministers have 
signed an agreement on the matter in Visby, Sweden. The Nordic 
countries will support the project with both training and 
material assistance. Timo Seppaenen reports from Visby: 
  [Seppaenen] The Baltic countries' joint peacekeeping 
battalion will be set up to operate in duties defined by the 
United Nations and the CSCE. The battalion will be formed by an 
Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian infantry company as well as 
the countries' joint logistics company and headquarters. The 
Baltic countries' readiness to create a modern peacekeeping 
force is very poor. For that reason, the countries need the 
assistance of the Nordic countries in handling even the most 
fundamental matters. 
  Under the agreement concluded today, the Nordic countries 
will be supporting the establishment of the peacekeeping 
battalion for three years. The first step in the project is 
language training. As early as the beginning of September, the 
Baltic peacekeepers are to be taught English-language military 
terms. The main part of the assistance offered by the Nordic 
countries consists of various forms of training. For instance, 
Finland's contribution to the cooperation consists mainly of 
that. The Baltic peacekeepers can receive training for instance 
at the Military Academy or at Niinisalo [near Helsinki] where 
military observer training is given. 
  The Nordic countries have also promised material aid to the 
Baltic countries. For the time being, only a small part of it 
will consist of weapons, but in time the Baltic peacekeepers are 
also likely to receive weapons from the Nordic countries, says 
Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn. 
  [Begin Rehn recording] When we are thinking of the 
peacekeeping battalion to come some time in the future, it might 
be quite natural that if they want, if the personal armaments 
used by our UN peacekeepers [as heard], we might perhaps sell 
them later. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Major Does Not Veto Dehaene"] </F>
  [Excerpts] British Prime Minister John Major will not veto 
Jean-Luc Dehaene as the successor to Jacques Delors, president 
of the European Commission (EC). Major said on BBC television 
that such a veto was "risky." The British attitude means that 
Lubbers' chances of getting the EC presidency have become 
extremely small. 
  Yesterday, in an unusual declaration, the parliamentary 
leaders of the four major Netherlands parties supported outgoing 
Prime Minister Lubbers' candidacy for the EC presidency. Kok 
(PvdA [Labor Party]), Brinkman (CDA [Christian Democratic 
Appeal]), Bolkestein (VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy]), and Van Mierlo (D66 [Democrats 66]) announced that 
they supported Lubbers "with conviction." 
  The race for the EC presidency is still formally entirely 
open, but if the rumors emanating from the European Union [EU] 
capitals are true, then a large majority of countries favor 
Belgian Prime Minister Dehaene. Lubbers' few remaining chances 
depended on Major's support. 
  In Brussels there was speculation on this possibility. The 
threat of a British veto probably could have led to a turnaround 
in the considerations of the other EU leaders. Now that Major 
is refusing to use such drastic means at the European Council on 
Corfu, Lubbers has lost his international supporters. 
  It had been assumed up to now that London had serious 
objections to Dehaene as EC president. But, according to the 
FINANCIAL TIMES, the Major government does not view Dehaene as 
the great advocate of a European superstate. The Belgian prime 
minister has more of a reputation in government circles as a 
"political fixer," the Belgians call him "the plumber," rather 
than a "European visionary." [passage omitted] 
  Outgoing Foreign Minister Kooijmans praised the initiative 
of 
the four parliamentary leaders at a CDA meeting on Monday 
evening. He praised Lubbers as the best candidate for Europe 
because "extreme adroitness will be required to keep the 
countries in the heart and on the edges of Europe together." 
  "Considering that the Netherlands, which is the only 
founding 
country of the European Community that has not provided a 
president, has put forward such an excellent candidate, can you 
tell me what is wrong with this candidate?" Kooijmans asked, 
almost desperately. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report signed "tom/APA": "Harsh Criticism of Haider by </F>
Busek: `A Minor in Terms of Democracy'"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- On Monday [6 June] Austrian People's Party 
[OeVP] Chairman and Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek reacted with 
extremely harsh words to the latest statements by Freedom Party 
of Austria [FPOe] Chairman Joerg Haider against Austria's 
membership in the European Union [EU]. Busek accused Haider of 
fanning fears among the population "against his better judgment." 
  The FPOe chairman is making claims that are "highly 
irresponsible" and, in the end, are "no longer justifiable" if 
one assumes a minimum standard of politics. 
  The OeVP chairman was referring to answers that the FPOe 
chairman gave to the KURIER readers' service. Among other 
things, Haider confirmed "incorrect" rumors that Austrian 
drinking water will be passed on to Brussels. He claimed that 
Chancellor Vranitzky is following orders "from outside Austria" 
issued by the Free Masons or, for instance, that in northern 
Germany several people have already died as a result of "mad-cow 
disease," the main source of which is England and which also 
threatens Austria, "because then there will not be any import 
restrictions anymore." 
  Busek said that in saying this Haider not only "confirmed 
that he is still a an adolescent in terms of democracy" but he 
had also made an "essential contribution" to "reducing 
credibility in politics as a whole." 
  The OeVP chairman was optimistic that the EU referendum will 
result in a positive vote. A result over 53 percent would be "a 
good result." The point is "a decision for the young 
generation." During the discussion over the past weeks, too much 
"pea counting" had been done. He would like the citizens to 
feel "a bit of the breath of history," Busek said. 
  On Monday the conference of provincial governors unanimously 
adopted an EU declaration, in which the citizens are called upon 
to vote "yes" on EU membership. It cites the following four 
main arguments: peace and security, the development of Austria 
as a business location, the development of a varied but 
integrated Europe, an Austrian voice in Europe. 
  EU State Secretary Brigitte Ederer said in an APA interview 
that she does not believe that the mood has changed toward 
rejection. However, the referendum is "certainly not yet over. 
The result will be narrow, but it will be narrowly positive," 
Ederer said. She appealed to those in favor of EU membership to 
"go to" the referendum. If the result should be "no," we will 
suffer from a "hangover" relatively quickly. Among other 
things, one has to expect investment to decline.

<F P=106> [Report by Herta Scharsach: "The Economy Is Picking Up"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- Following export successes during the 
first quarter and rising employment, the reviving economy now 
finally seems to have an effect on tax revenues: During the 
first five months of 1994 gross revenues rose by 10.6 percent to 
212.1 billion schillings. After transfers to provinces and 
localities, and spending, the federal government was left with 
139.9 billion schillings, which is 22.4 percent more than during 
the same quarter in 1993. 
  This "record increase" in revenues is, however, deceptive: 
It only came about because the dates on which taxes are due 
were shifted from June to May and because deductible import 
turnover tax soared as a result of of rising imports. However, 
according to financial experts, now "prospects are better that 
we will get closer to the forecasts." Thus, this year tax 
losses will probably be lower than the feared 5 billion 
shillings. "It is at least true that we are not losing any 
more, but the improvement is weak," Wifo [Economic Research 
Institute] tax expert Gerhard Lehner says. 
<H5>  Boom in Imports </H5>
  In the wake of tax reform, payroll tax revenues were rather 
weak with 52.5 billion schillings (minus 6.1 percent); on the 
other hand, value-added tax revenues increased by 13.4 percent, 
to 80.3 billion schillings. An Austrian buying spree is 
indicated by imports, which increased by 9.5 percent to 148.2 
billion schillings during the first quarter. However, in view 
of the advance burdens associated with potential EU membership, 
in particular for agriculture, an "explosion" of the net deficit 
(80.7 billion schillings) can be prevented only if the federal 
government receives the planned billions in revenues from 
various sales (such as the federal share in Vienna airport, the 
Creditanstalt bank or Bank Austria). 
  Unemployment remains high (6 percent of 4.5 percent 
according 
to the seasonally adjusted OECD model). The OECD is discussing 
this problem in Paris today. According to a Wifo study, the 
economy would have to grow by 2 percent to maintain the current 
number of jobs.

<F P=106> [APA report: "Wifo: Further Reduction in Number of Jobs in </F>
Industry"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Production in industry would have to 
increase by 4.5 percent per year for the number of jobs to 
remain unchanged. In order to maintain the number of jobs at the 
same level, the economy has to grow by 2 percent altogether, a 
study of the Economic Research Institute (Wifo) says. 
  In the event of economic stagnation, the number of 
employees, 
including the self-employed, would decrease by about 0.5 
percent. This year, with the same growth rate, the progress in 
productivity is the same as in the past, the Wifo stresses. 
  The struggle against unemployment is, above all, complicated 
by the relatively low long-term economic growth and a major 
increase in the labor supply: If economic growth were to 
increase by 1 percentage point, employment would increase by 0.4 
percent or about 12,000 persons. 
  Despite the decrease in the average retirement age in the 
past 15 years, the labor supply increased by well over 1 percent 
per year. Almost half of it is due to the influx of foreign 
labor. 
  Therefore, in the long-term, unemployment will only 
stabilize 
when the economy grows by 3 percent. 
  The domestic labor market shows a clear discrepancy in its 
structure. Many new jobs in the services sector and in 
construction were not filled with unemployed, but largely with 
persons from the "hidden reserve" and from abroad who were 
looking for jobs.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Europe: Six Questions to Four </F>
Flemish Parties"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  1. What Should the Role of the European Parliament Be? </H5>
  CVP [Christian People's Party]: The European Parliament (EP) 
is still too limited in its ability to take action. The joint 
decisionmaking procedure, political control of the European 
Commission (EC) but not of the Council, and budget control are 
all inadequate. The EP must be a legislative pillar. 
  VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats]: The Maastricht Treaty 
strengthened the EP legislative role. This is apparent in the 
decisionmaking power it shares with the Council in some areas. 
Be that as it may, Europe is led by a small group of national 
leaders who are not elected, or at least not directly. We must 
lean toward an EP which is on an equal footing with the Council. 
The EC must be able to count on a majority. 
  SP [Socialist Party]: The EP played an important role in the 
European unification process. It managed to impose important 
measures: Lowering the price of unleaded gas, limiting food 
additives, maintaining travel reductions for young people, etc. 
Moreover, the Maastricht Treaty granted it new powers. 
  Live Differently: The EP is working in a situation of 
democratic deficit. It does not have the same powers as 
national parliaments. We suggest that the future EC president as 
well as the future commissioners, be chosen from among the EP 
members. 
<H5>  2. Europe Has Almost 20 Million Unemployed People. What </H5>
Solution Do You Recommend for This Dramatic Situation? 
  CVP: Unemployment can only be fought with the support of a 
strong economy. The redistribution of labor is one path, which 
can be adapted to the various sectors. In addition, greater 
flexibility as well as a lowering of indirect labor costs 
(employers' contributions, etc.) will make our economy more 
competitive and will facilitate recruitment. The European 
social model of bilateral negotiations offers the best weapon 
for fighting unemployment. 
  VLD: In order to combat this immense problem, both 
structurally and permanently, it is essential that wage costs be 
reduced throughout Europe. An employment policy must go hand in 
hand with an increase in motivation. We must therefore close 
the gap between the minimum wage and unemployment benefit 
payments. Furthermore, the current regulations governing 
working time, professional careers, and the legal retirement age 
must be made more flexible. 
  SP: We want a coherent recovery plan that takes account of 
ecological and social issues. Money must be reinvested in 
labor, not in speculation. Every year we want to offer 5 
million Europeans the chance to get trained or retrained. 
However, labor too must be reorganized and tailored to the 
workers. Flexibility and the four-day working week must create 
jobs. Meeting social needs can also create jobs. 
  Live differently: While in 1985, the official report on the 
Single Market predicted 5 million new jobs, the gap between the 
rich and poor has widened. This is proof of the failure of the 
traditional vision which holds that economic growth is a valid 
solution to the crisis. We advocate the creation of new 
"ecological" jobs, the four-day or 32-hour workweek, etc. 
<H5>  3. In Order To Slow Down Relocalizations by Businesses, Do </H5>
You Support a Social Clause in Trade? 
  CVP: The basic conventions of the International Labor 
Organization (ILO) must be applied across the board (freedom of 
trade union association, collective bargaining, ban on forced 
work, etc.). We favor positive measures, since negative 
measures lead too easily to protectionism. 
  VLD: The elimination of Europe's internal borders has had a 
positive impact on the economy. Tightening up regulations 
cannot slow down this development. The development of 
homogeneous legislation in the various member states regarding 
the siting of businesses (e.g., legislation on the environment) 
will be much more effective. 
  SP: The SP defends the social clauses of international 
treaties. Economic development and social progress must go hand 
in hand. Social clauses make it compulsory to respect the limits 
of social morality. 
  Live differently: A European economic area which does not 
have a strong social dimension will increase imbalances and 
reinforce social dumping. We advocate the adoption of measures 
to prevent social and ecological dumping, such as the obligation 
to include the ILO social clause in all agreements. The Union 
must impose customs duties in order to compensate for 
differences in social and environmental protection [among 
different countries]. Revenue thus generated will be earmarked 
for development projects and the correction of factors 
responsible for creating social and economic distortion. 
<H5>  4. What Are the Broad Lines of Your Economic Policy? </H5>
  CVP: There are two essential paths: Coordinating action in 
the Twelve (like the overall plan), and developing actions at 
European level (continuing the construction of the Single 
Market, social dialogue within the Union, etc.). We must 
maintain the competitiveness of the European economy, without 
slipping into a permanent spiral of layoffs and downgrading of 
the people's well-being. 
  VLD: The consistent increase in the German money supply is 
forcing the central banks to keep interest rates high. This, 
combined with our low productivity and harsh labor legislation, 
plunged Europe into the worst recession in the postwar era. The 
member states must lean toward greater economic and monetary 
convergence. Moreover, European labor legislation must be made 
more flexible. 
  SP: The current problems are the result of the economic 
crisis. Social Europe was never given consideration. Some 
people recommend that we let competition have a free rein. 
However, this competition risks leading to a debacle in which 
the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Europe has a 
choice: egoism or solidarity. We are opting for solidarity. 
  Live differently: The Maastricht Treaty is increasing 
economic competition among European states and regions. We 
support the development of economic policies that allow the 
weakest to catch up with those who are better armed. We do not 
support the uniform application of austerity measures. We 
advocate a regulation limiting speculation. 
<H5>  5. What Is Your Program on Immigration? </H5>
  CVP: Refugee rights to be protected, as guaranteed by the 
Geneva Convention, must be maintained or even extended to become 
a humanitarian status which grants temporary protection. We 
need a European policy to channel and curb refugees as well as 
combat the reasons for it (prevention of economic refugees). In 
addition, the situation of refugees who are not acknowledged but 
who have become integrated, must be regularized. 
  VLD: There is serious tension in our society between various 
population groups. Some conceal these problems. Other advocate 
inhuman solutions. There is a third way: Integrating 
foreigners by having them adapt to our values and way of life 
(freedom of expression, the democratic decisionmaking process, 
equality of the sexes) 
  SP: We want Europe to be a completely safe and welcome land 
for political refugees. Procedures and guarantees must be equal 
for everyone. A European regulation must be implemented for 
economic migrants. Europe must prevent and combat illegal 
immigration and illegal work. However, refugees fleeing famine, 
war, or natural disasters must also be taken in for a limited 
time. 
  Live differently: Europe has to recognize that it is a 
region of immigration. A new European immigration policy 
(quotas) must replace the halting of immigration that has been 
in place for 20 years. Asylum procedures must be unified as 
must actions to combat illegal work. We advocate the right to 
vote for all immigrants who have been residents for five years. 
<H5>  6. What Are Your Three Priorities in Agriculture? </H5>
  CVP: 1. Food safety: sufficient and varied production. 2. 
Farmer incomes: Sound and well-structured farms must be able to 
generate a reasonable income. 3. The environment: Farmers have 
a mission to preserve nature. 
  VLD: The VLD is opting for a liberal agricultural policy 
which is socially minded and which respects the environment. 
Liberal in that production is tailored to the interplay of 
supply and demand to avoid surpluses; aid from the public 
authorities must be selective. Social in that we advocate a 
maximum level of employment in the agricultural sector; the 
system of guaranteed prices should be advantageously replaced by 
a system of guaranteed incomes for productive farmers. 
  SP: The Socialists want another agricultural policy, one 
which will help farmers have decent incomes for a qualitatively 
better production that respects the environment. We will have 
to put the emphasis on income supports, but this goes hand in 
hand with a reduction in production. The regions must be able 
to follow their own policies. 
  Live differently: 1. Parity of incomes for farmers and other 
social categories. 2. Improvement in the quality of foodstuffs 
and safeguards for genetic diversity. 3. The reform of the 
Common Agricultural Policy by abolishing export subsidies. 
Policies ensuring suitable prices for "ecological" farms.

<F P=106> [Article signed WP/KvdB: "Flemish Socialists Are Only </F>
Winners in May Survey -- Flemish Liberal Democrats Drop Slowly, 
Christian People's Party Remains Below 22 Percent"] 
  [Excerpt] The SP [Dutch-speaking Socialist Party] is the 
only Flemish party to make clear progress in the May survey 
which the Dimarso polling bureau, commissioned by DE MORGEN, 
carried among of 1,000 Flemings, 1,000 Walloons, and 400 
inhabitants of Brussels aged 18 and above. 
  The Flemish Socialists appear to be slowly recovering from 
the uproar caused by the BBTK [Socialist Union of Employees] 
scandal in March. Back then, the SP dropped from 17.6 percent 
to 15.3 percent. In May, the SP climbed back to 16.2 percent. 
That is still 3.4 percent below the result obtained in 24 
November 1991. 
  The VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] has not managed to reach 
the 30 percent mark again since January. In May, the VLD party 
dropped half a percent from 29.2 percent to 28.7 percent. 
  The CVP [Christian People's Party] is stagnating at 21.7 
percent (up 0.2 percent), and since September 1993 has not 
exceeded 22 percent. Live Differently [Ecologists], however, is 
the big loser. The Ecologists lost 1.1 percent of their support 
and dropped to 10.6 percent. The VB [Flemish Bloc] scored 11.3 
percent after a climb of 0.3 percent. The VU [The People's 
Union] was forced to give back some of the ground gained in 
April and dropped 0.4 percent to 7 percent. Rossem is at 3.1 
percent (up 0.2 percent). 
<H5>  French-Speaking Socialist Party Drops </H5>
  In Wallonia, the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party] saw 
another 1.1 percent of votes flow away. The atmosphere of 
scandal is continuing to pursue the French-speaking Socialists. 
With 30.5 percent, Busquin is only 0.4 percent above February's 
historic low point (30.1 percent). 
  The PSC [Social Christian Party] managed to benefit a little 
from PS losses and climbed by 0.6 percent to 19.9 percent. Ecolo 
also is on the increase: up 0.7 percent (to 16.5 percent). Jean 
Gol's PRL [Liberal Reformation Party] stagnates at 22.9 percent 
(down 0.2 percent). The "others" category, including the United 
Left and National Front, also stagnates at 10.2 percent. 
  Dimarso's survey traditionally covers voter preferences for 
national parliamentary elections, therefore it is not per se 
representative for the upcoming European elections. 
Nevertheless, it is probable that in the middle of the European 
campaigns, telephone surveys give a good indication of 
intentions for the European elections. Reference is made to the 
strongly domestic character of this European campaign, which 
would reduce the chance of differences between surveys covering 
European or national elections. 
  In the latest Dimarso poll, 17.2 percent did not answer. 
That is a few percentage points lower than the normal average. 
In April, the "don't know, refuse" category was 18.9 percent.

<F P=106> ["Lm"-signed article: "On the Difficult Path Toward the </F>
Goal"] 
  [Text] Understandably it is the prime minister who has the 
broadest powers. He has a far from unsubstantial influence on 
the policies of the individual department ministers, though in 
most cases it is only the departmental ministers themselves who 
are judged on these policies. 
  In the past five years international relations (not to be 
confused with foreign policy), the broad lines of financial 
policy through the Treasury Ministry, and media and culture were 
the direct responsibility of the head of government. 
  Strengthening Luxembourg's position with regard to the new 
orientation of the European Union has understandably been a 
constant theme in recent years. 
  With regard to the single internal market, as of 1 January 
1992 the country was certainly able to take advantage of the EC 
presidency in the first half of 1991, Prime Minister Jacques 
Santer believes not without pride. In particular it was able to 
fashion the harmonization of tax and excises in such a way as 
not to damage Luxembourg's competitive position vis-a-vis its 
partners. 
  Naturally, a mechanical effect on national price development 
could not be excluded, he admits, but the key thing is that it 
proved possible to maintain an advantage toward neighboring 
countries. 
  When it comes to "monetary union," the prime minister points 
out, it has been possible to keep the Belgian-Luxembourg franc 
within the hard currency group. The Luxembourg Monetary 
Institute [IML] has been expanded with a view to the transition 
to phase three. He is "very pleased" that, despite many 
difficulties, our country has been able to stick to all the 
convergence criteria, and that right now it is the only country 
which still fulfills these. 
  To carry out the governmental work more effectively, the 
government declaration included a draft bill on the reform of 
the Audit Office. For a long time, however, this topic was 
gradually forgotten, and it was not until a few weeks ago that a 
bill to this effect was submitted by CSV [Christian Social 
People's Party] representative Francois Colling as president of 
the Finance Committee. Santer nonetheless energetically refutes 
any government responsibility in the bill's delay. 
  The Audit Office is a body which is at the disposal of the 
Parliament, which is responsible for its restructuring in 
cooperation, of course, with the government, given that this 
action also requires the reform of government accounting. Here 
the preparatory work has been largely concluded, so that both 
reforms can now to carried through in parallel. 
  Luxembourg, which proudly sees its place confirmed as the 
world's seventh largest financial marketplace, has been very 
concerned in recent years to improve its supervisory activities, 
so as to prevent abuse, money laundering and insider offenses. 
The bursting of the BCCI [Bank of Credit and Commerce 
International] scandal into the midst of these efforts, should 
not, in Santer's view, be overvalued. This scandal clearly did 
not originate in Luxembourg. Nor should one be under any 
illusion that laws provide absolute protection against scandals. 
  Overall supervision has been notably increased in recent 
years not only by the transposition of all the EU directives, 
but also through the expansion of the IML, the law against tax 
evasion and on legal aid. This has confirmed the seriousness of 
the banking market, which has also been reflected in 
international assessments. 
  Not without pride Santer also points to the fact that it was 
the Luxembourg authorities which succeeded in bringing to 
justice one of the largest international drug dealers in the 
person of Franklin Jurado. 
  The second field with which Jacques Santer identifies 
himself 
(also personally), is the media sector, in which in 1989 people 
were optimistically expecting a renewal of the licence with CLT 
[Luxembourg Line Broadcasting Company]. In the meantime the 
negotiations ran aground. 
  "Over the last two months" the prime minister has "become 
optimistic again," though pointing out in the same breath that, 
given the deadline of 1 January 1996, there is no urgency. 
Reaching an accord will be "one of the new government's first 
jobs." 
  One of the most controversial draft bills of the past 
legislative period was the liberalization of the national media. 
Santer does not consider the fact that the initial euphoria has 
givewn way to a large extent to a more sober approach as a 
failure of this project. Completely new paths have been taken. 
Difficulties will always be there. It is the same in every 
country. 
  The standards which the government has set provide the 
starting conditions: it is now up to the individual radio 
stations to fight it out. For Santer, the same applies also to 
sociocultural radio. He does not want to exclude the possibility 
that many changes could still occur. For him, this is normal.

<F P=106> [Article by Lucien Lux, Socialist representative: "Lies by a </F>
Flop"] 
  [Text] Every Saturday the LUXEMBURGER WORT publishes a 
special page that is called "CSV [Christian Social People's 
Party] Profile" when in reality it is a Juncker [minister of 
labor] fan magazine trying increasingly to find its place among 
satirical papers from which it differs, however, by its shabby 
style. 
  On 28 May, the undersigned received a dubious honor in this 
page's column. My name was bandied about with and animal 
comparisons were made. One could feel the almost childish fun 
that must have overcome the author when writing this lampoon, 
something which I last enjoyed in second grade. 
  Mr. Juncker is to be pitied. He who, in the early stage of 
the election campaign, had announced objective explanations 
because politics is "no beauty contest," he who likes to present 
himself as the prototype of elevated political standards has to 
live with the accusation now of having dragged serious topics 
down to a very low level and having degraded the ideological 
debate to playpen standards. 
  To the issue itself, Juncker blames me for praising the 
minister of labor in Parliament on 18 May and criticizing him in 
TAGEBLATT on 21 May and even accuses me of cowardice. 
  The dilemma of the minister of labor is obvious. But it 
still does not entitle him to resort to lies that could 
doubtlessly win him an honorary membership in Mr. Mehlen's club. 
One membership card more or less would not matter anyway, when 
Juncker is also a member of the initiative against the same 
hazardous waste dump which he supported as a member of the 
administration. 
  On 18 May I praised the legislative results of the minister 
of labor because the five statutes of labor law passed during 
this parliamentary term were positive. 
  On 21 May I criticized the minister of labor because his 
overall performance as minister of labor is completely 
inadequate. 
  Why it is unsatisfactory I explained in detail on 18 May in 
Parliament in the presence of the minister of labor by listing 
his omissions: 
  1. There were no impulses or new ideas for humanization of 
the work environment and work safety. Failure no. 1! 
  2. For five years nothing has happened to encourage 
participation in decision making, a broad and important field. 
Failure no. 2! 
  3. Instead of discussing working time regulations, new types 
of working time, etc., there has been a five year silence. 
Failure no. 3! 
  4. In the field of plant inspection there was hardly any 
progress worth mentioning. Failure no. 4! 
  5. Nothing happened to bad weather settlements despite the 
possibility of preliminary work. Failure no. 5! 
  This review is all the more alarming because the reform 
plans 
were part of the 1989 government statement, in fact some had 
already been promised in 1984. Not to mention the numerous 
unanswered letters and inquiries, or the committees under the 
responsibility of the minister of labor which have not met in 
months and years...! When Juncker regretted on 28 May that 
unemployment was a "non-topic" in Luxembourg, he concedes that 
he not only reacted too late in this matter and that his 
measures did not work, but also that he has failed socially and 
as a political ideologist, even though he is not bad at 
influencing the masses. But it seems that he did not want to 
waste his skill on the Ministry of Labor which hardly interested 
him.... 
  This view is shared by the independent LETZEBUERGER LAND, 
which writes on 14 January 94: "The eloquent ministerial 
introduction of the press conference (...) was probably meant to 
make one forget that the Ministry of Labor so far has been 
somewhat neglected." 
  How little Juncker was interested the Ministry of Labor over 
the past five years is illustrated by another fact: 
  The recently passed laws on subcontracted labor, on the 
office for disabled workers, on part-time work and on collective 
dismissals had been introduced in the chamber of deputies on 30 
May 1989 (!) or 9 May 1989 (!!) or 18 January 1983 (!!!) or 1 
October 1980 (!!!!) respectively. The law on job safety itself 
is the implementation of a European directive that earned 
Luxembourg a reprimand from the Brussels Commission because of 
delay of application! Thus during five long years nothing new 
came from Juncker, not a single new regulation in labor law was 
introduced during this period! 
  It takes a good share of political impertinence and 
brazenness in view of this pathetic performance, to present 
oneself as a great workhorse and to toast oneself as a 
successful minister of labor. How come nobody else is joining in? 
  The fact is that, due to Juncker, there is an enormous 
backlog in the Ministry of Labor. The fact is also that the 
Ministry of Labor would never be neglected in Socialist hands. 
  Even the propaganda of lies by the current flop cannot hide

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bolkestein Sees Kok as Purple </F>
Coalition Leader"] 
  [Text] VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] 
leader Bolkestein feels that PvdA [Labor Party] leader Kok 
should be prime minister in a "purple" coalition government 
[comprising the VVD, the PvdA, and the D66 [Democrats 66]. Kok 
himself and D66 leader Van Mierlo did not wish to make any 
comment on the matter this morning [6 June]. 
  Before the coalition negotiations between the PvdA, the VVD, 
and the D66 could go further in the First Chamber this morning, 
Bolkestein said: "I think that the present coalition, if it at 
least works, will govern during the next four years under the 
leadership of Mr. Kok. That seems rather obvious." 
  Bolkestein was reacting to the outcome of a survey carried 
out last weekend by the firm Infomart ISM at the request of the 
television program "Focal Point" news show which showed that 53 
percent of VVD voters would have no problem with a PvdA prime 
minister. In addition, 80 percent of the VVD voters support a 
coalition with the PvdA and the D66. Bolkestein concluded this 
morning by saying that this means that he can go ahead with the 
negotiations on a coalition with the PvdA and the D66. 
  During a VVD congress last week, the party leader was 
already 
receiving the support of the VVD party officials. Bolkestein 
said: "So I can go ahead, on the condition of course that the 
right policy comes out of this. In any case, I do not notice 
any reluctance among my supporters or my party with regard to 
the negotiations currently under way." 
  It is expected that some links will be forged this week on 
the social, economic, and financial fronts. If that is indeed 
the case, then it will not be long until we have a definitive 
coalition agreement. There should be no talk of ideological 
differences in any of the points currently being negotiated. 
  The survey among VVD supporters also shows which points in 
the VVD platform must, according to the VVD voters, remain in 
the policy of a "purple" government. Combating crime was named 
by 85 percent as being essential, while 80 percent of the VVD 
voters felt that asylum policy was essential. Of the surveyed, 
48 percent felt that budget cuts of 9 billion guilders were 
essential and 40 percent felt that a "minimal" social security 
system was needed. 
  Otherwise, 21 percent of the surveyed VVD supporters said 
that they supported a PvdA prime minister. Of the opponents, 39 
percent would prefer Bolkestein, 21 percent Van Mierlo, and 14 
percent would like Wiegel back. 
  H. Vonhoff, the Groningen police chief and prominent VVD 
supporter, expressed his surprise yesterday in the same 
broadcast of "Focal Point" news show about the popularity of a 
"purple" coalition among the VVD voters. He felt that the 
chances were good that a "purple" coalition would be set up. 
"If there is a time when such a coalition could exist, then the 
chances for it over the past 25 years have not been great." 
According to Vonhoff, the choice of a PvdA prime minister is a 
sign of "political realism" among VVD supporters. "There is a 
great deal of confidence in Bolkestein; I am convinced of that. 
However, nobody is committed to the impossible, and VVD 
supporters understand that quite well." He feels it is 
understandable that the VVD supporters want to retain a number 
of essential points. "If you win such a stunning victory on the 
back of such a clear platform, then naturally you must not 
distance yourself from these points."

<F P=106> [Julie Kirkbride report: "African Landmine Contract Angers </F>
MP"] 
  [Text] The Prime Minister has been asked to clarify 
Britain's policy on the manufacture of landmines following 
reports that Royal Ordnance, along with other armament 
manufacturers, has won a UN contract to clear landmines from 
Mozambique. 
  The reported award of the multi-million-pound contract to an 
international group of arms manufacturers was called into 
question by Mr Tom Clarke, Labour's Overseas Development 
spokesman, yesterday. 
  The British Mines Advisory Group has expressed alarm at the 
prospect that money earmarked by the UN for humanitarian 
purposes could be given to munitions factories who profit twice 
-- from the production and then the clearance of landmines. 
  The concern follows reports that Royal Ordnance successfully 
headed a consortium, including Lonrho and Mechem of South 
Africa, that won a 3.3 million pounds UN aid contract to clear 
landmines from 1,200 miles of road in Mozambique. 
  Royal Ordnance now run privately by British Aerospace, has 
not produced landmines for a decade, but was recently involved 
in a Ministry of Defence programme to develop a new generation 
of anti-tank mines which was cancelled due to defence cuts. 
  Mr Clarke said he had written to Mr Major demanding to know 
whether the Royal Ordnance factory planned to manufacture 
landmines. 
  He said: "Parliament should take the issue of landmines more 
seriously. They are a huge problem in the Third World." 
  More than 100 million mines are estimated to be scattered 
around 62 countries. 
  A Foreign Office spokesman said that while Britain supported 
a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel landmines which 
endangered civilians, it did not approve a blanket ban on their 
production. 
  Royal Ordnance was unavailable to comment on the contract 
last night.

<F P=106> [By Joe Quinn, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Text] Twenty-two people were arrested by police guarding 
military trucks which protesters claim are used to move nuclear 
missile warheads around Britain on public roads. 
  The arrests were made last night at Balloch, Strathclyde, 
near the Royal Navy base on the Clyde where Polaris and Trident 
nuclear submarines are sited. 
  The Scottish skirmish was the latest in a series of clashes 
between the convoys, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and 
other peace protesters. 
  Trucks with police motorcycle outriders were briefly halted 
earlier today by protesters at Albermarle, near Newcastle upon 
Tyne, and then Stirling in Scotland. 
  Anti-nuclear campaigners claimed the convoy was one of those 
which regularly took warheads between Burghfield, Berks, and the 
Clyde submarine base. 
  Pat Freeborn said it was impeded near Balloch when 
demonstrators chained themselves to vehicles and daubed them 
with paint in protest at warheads being carried on public roads. 
  "If they are going to have such dangerous weapons, there 
must 
be another method of moving them," he said. "They are going to 
end up blowing up the very people they are supposed to be 
protecting." 
  The Ministry of Defence said there were "incidents" today 
involving a military convoy, but described them as minor and 
would not confirm the presence of nuclear warhead carriers. 
  Police said 15 men and seven women were arrested over an 
alleged breach of the peace but could not say if they would 
appear in court.

<F P=106> [Interview with Social Democratic Party chairman Ingvar </F>
Carlsson by Mats Hallgren and Rolf Gustavsson in Stockholm; date 
not given] 
  [Text] [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Sweden now has a package that 
is the result of the negotiations with the European Union [EU] 
and soon the Social Democratic Party congress will make up its 
mind about EU membership. Are you still as committed a 
supporter of membership as you were? 
  [Carlsson] The answer is yes. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Was the package that emerged from the 
membership negotiations largely as you expected? 
  [Carlsson] Yes. It was more or less what I had been 
expecting. I think that the government handled the negotiations 
well. On the decisive issues we were in close contact. But it 
did end up a little expansive. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] It could be you who has to find the 
money -- around 20 billion a year. How is this to be done? 
  [Carlsson] It is a lot of money, but put it in the 
perspective of what unemployment costs. More than 40 billion a 
year in cash support alone! Twice as much as the EU membership 
fee. Since I view membership as a major opportunity to combat 
unemployment, it is my assessment that if we pursue sensible 
policies we will more than get our money back. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But the membership fee has to be 
financed out of a budget that already has a deficit of 200 
billion. Will you make savings or will you raise taxes? 
  [Carlsson] It is our view that production should chiefly 
bear the cost since it is production that will chiefly benefit 
from membership, but we have not discussed this fully. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] The money we get back goes to farmers 
among others, and there seems to be a Social Democratic idea of 
increasing real estate taxes for farmers. 
  [Carlsson] I do not want to say anything other than that 
production must meet the cost. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] If we were to summarize your approach it 
is an unreserved yes to membership in the European Union? 
  [Carlsson] Yes. Now we know the terms, and my 
recommendation to the congress will be that we should say yes to 
the package that emerged from the negotiations. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] And it is you assessment that the 
congress will say yes? 
  [Carlsson] That is my assessment and it is of course 
important for me that that is the outcome. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] You have two major tasks as party 
leader: regaining government power and getting a yes in the 
referendum. Do you see any link between the two? 
  [Carlsson] I myself will push the yes line whether we win or 
lose the election. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But surely it would be a position of 
strength to be able to push that line in government? 
  [Carlsson] Yes, it is probable that people will listen more 
to me as prime minister than as leader of the opposition and as 
a loser. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Do you believe that a continuation of a 
nonsocialist government will benefit the no side in the 
referendum? 
  [Carlsson] If I may be allowed to engage in some polemic, I 
would say that first Bildt frightened off the supporters of the 
EU in the Social Democratic Party by linking the EU issue with 
Moderate policies. Now he is frightening off his own people as 
a result of the thoroughly foolish treatment of Bjorn von der 
Esch [Moderate Riksdag deputy removed from party list for his 
opposition to the EU], which I think is damaging the yes side. 
If we were having the referendum in two weeks, as Bildt 
suggested, I would be very worried. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] How should those Social Democrats who 
want a no to the EU vote in the Riksdag elections? Can they vote 
for you? 
  [Carlsson] Of course. I have committed myself to voting no 
in the Riksdag if there is a no in the referendum. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] You have just said that your chances of 
winning sympathy for a yes vote would increase if you became 
prime minister. Then surely a Social Democratic opponent of the 
EU should vote for Carl Bildt? 
  [Carlsson] As Social Democrats people must make up their 
minds about whether or not Social Democratic policies are to be 
pursued, either inside or outside the EU. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] If you win the Riksdag election and 
there is a yes in the referendum you will be the man who speaks 
for Sweden when the EU considers reforms in 1996. There are two 
approaches. One wants to deepen the EU with greater integration 
and more majority decisions. The other approach wants to water 
down the EU and strengthen the right of veto. Where do you 
stand in this debate? 
  [Carlsson] I am not on the British side, which wants to 
water down the EU. The British Conservatives want as little 
politics as possible in the EU. This is a neoliberal position. 
I want to join Europe because I want to be involved in shaping 
European policy. Whether on unemployment, environmental policy, 
or the social dimension. If you want to achieve anything, 
political decisiveness is needed in Europe. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So you do not want to strengthen the 
right of veto? 
  [Carlsson] No, I do not think so. On the contrary, we 
should give consideration to extending majority decisions in the 
fields of environmental policy and social issues, for example. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So a Sweden ruled by the Social 
Democrats will not help to water down the EU? 
  [Carlsson] No, I do not think so. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] In 1996 the EU will reach a decision on 
joint defenses. What position will you adopt then? 
  [Carlsson] We are in favor of joint security. As was Olof 
Palme in his day. But we draw the line when it comes to 
military nonalignment. That is something that we are not 
prepared to give up. We cannot abandon one security policy 
stance without knowing what the next one means. And we do not 
intend to seek NATO membership. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] What is your position on the plans for 
economic and monetary union (EMU) and the transition to a common 
currency? 
  [Carlsson] I think that we have to strengthen currency 
cooperation, which means that countries can support each other. 
I cannot say today what form this should take, but a strong 
counterbalance to the market's speculators is needed. A more 
intense discussion of this question is needed. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Do you want Sweden to abandon the 
floating exchange rate and enter into a currency community? 
  [Carlsson] We will have to do this sooner or later, whether 
we join the EU or not. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] There is a concern that crime and drugs 
will flood in across the borders if border controls are removed. 
How are we to prevent this? 
  [Carlsson] The problem is that we are beginning to have 
global crime, arising in part from the collapse of the old 
Soviet Union and from the drug dealers. This is extremely 
serious for the whole of Europe, but I think that we will never 
be able to solve the problems of controls within Europe; the 
important thing is how we organize customs and police 
cooperation throughout Europe. We will never come to grips with 
this problem on our own if we stay outside the EU. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Do we not give away more power if we 
join the EU? 
  [Carlsson] We also win more power. The no side wants more 
power over what is a growing powerlessness. If you want power 
over the issues that are normally decided by the Riksdag and 
government, you have to meet the threats where they are to be 
found. And today that is at a level above national boundaries. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] If we are to believe the opinion polls 
half of Social Democratic voters say no to the EU. What is the 
explanation? 
  [Carlsson] There are four reasons. The Maastricht 
procedure harmed the EU. The referendums in Denmark and France 
created further uncertainty. Then the nonsocialist government 
declared that the lower taxes and the razing of social welfare 
benefits were adjustments to the EU. The fourth is the 
recession and unemployment. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Have not you and the party leadership 
failed to win a sympathetic hearing? Are you out of step with 
the movement? 
  [Carlsson] That is something we cannot judge until we arrive 
at the referendum. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] What will be your arguments for EU 
membership? 
  [Carlsson] I will ask the fundamental question that every 
Social Democrat must ask himself: Do you think that we can best 
realize our ideas about the welfare society if we are members or 
if we are not? This is the simple and the difficult question. 
My response is that I am absolutely convinced that we have a 
better chance if we are members. And this covers everything 
from peace in Europe to how I am to be able to earn a living 
from my own work. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Do you believe then that a no would 
threaten social welfare ideals? 
  [Carlsson] I believe at least that it would be more 
difficult to achieve those goals -- employment, for example. In 
addition we believe that we have a contribution to make. Social 
democracy is not just Sweden. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] You have made a rational calculation, 
but the problem is that the debate is emotionally charged. 
  [Carlsson] Yes, but as a politician one has a duty to 
present one's rational arguments. Over and above this I will 
speak with feeling and involvement about Europe. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Could it not be the case that the 
opposition to the EU has its roots in mistrust of you and other 
politicians? 
  [Carlsson] It is possible that people incorporate me in the 
mistrust of Maastricht that I mentioned. I believe that in the 
final analysis it is a question of credibility. Who do you 
trust? And I hope that those who trust me in other respects will 
also do so on this issue. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But if it is a question of credibility 
it looks today as if [the Green Ecology Party's] Per Gahrton and 
[Left Party leader] Gudrun Schyman have greater credibility than 
Ingvar Carlsson and Carl Bildt. 
  [Carlsson] I would have been very nervous if we were to have 
had the referendum in two weeks. We would then have to resort 
to emergency measures to tackle this problem. Now people have 
an opportunity to think over the issues and then we will see who 
has most credibility. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Are you willing to put all your 
credibility on the line? 
  [Carlsson] Not in the sense that I am threatening to resign. 
It is a bad strategy to threaten. Our approach is positive 
faith. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] If the result in November is a no, will 
there then be renegotiation and a new referendum? 
  [Carlsson] No, the referendum will decide the matter for a 
long time to come. There is no chance of any renegotiation. A 
new referendum in a year's time is completely out of the 
question. 
  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So we would then have to make do with 
the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement? 
  [Carlsson] It is lucky that we have it, but it does not give 
us any political influence. If I was head of the Export Council 
I might perhaps say that it was enough, but it is not enough for 
me as Social Democratic Party chairman.

<F P=106> [Dick Ljungberg report: "A Majority of Their Own for Social </F>
Democrats"] 
  [Text] The Social Democrats would have achieved a majority 
of their own with 184 seats, the four parties in the current 
coalition would have taken 150 seats, and the Left Party would 
have had a chance of the remaining 15 seats if there had been a 
Riksdag election in May. This is the rough result of the 
Central Bureau of Statistics [SCB] most recent poll on party 
sympathies in the lead-up to the election. 
  The SCB carries out the largest opinion polls: The sample 
between 2 and 24 May was 9,300 people, of whom 19.7 percent did 
not respond for various reasons. 
  Since the last poll in November three parties show 
statistically reliable changes: progress for the Moderate 
Coalition Party and the Center Party, and a three-point collapse 
for New Democracy. Since November New Democracy's voters have 
moved -- in order of magnitude -- to the sofa (don't knows), the 
Moderates, the Social Democrats, and the Center Party. 
  In an otherwise fairly stable situation, with a continued 
large majority for the Social Democrats, interest chiefly 
centers on which parties will clear the 4-percent threshold for 
representation in the Riksdag. This could have a decisive 
effect on the question of who forms the government after the 
election on 18 September. 
  New Democracy and the Green Ecology Party clearly lie below 
the threshold. The Left Party is balancing on the edge with 3.9 
percent, but the party is no longer "reliably" under the 
threshold -- which it has been since May 1992. The Christian 
Democratic Party [KDS] has 4.4 percent -- something that is 
hardly reassuring. The margin of error for the KDS as for the 
Left Party is plus/minus 0.5 percent. 
  This would have been the result of an election in May, with 
the changes since November in parentheses: 
  Center Party 7.9 percent (plus 1.2), Liberal Party 6.7 
(minus 
0.2), Moderate Coalition Party 21.8 (plus 2.2), KDS 4.4 (plus 
0.4), New Democracy 2.3 (minus 3.0), Social Democrats 50.1 
(minus 0.8), Left Party 3.9 (plus 0.4), Green Ecology Party 2.6 
(plus 0.1), and other parties 0.4 (minus 0.1). 
  The gains from New Democracy are the Moderates' and the 
Center Party's only clear net gains since November. In the past 
six months the Social Democrats have chiefly made gains from the 
don't know group. 
  In an election in May the nonsocialists -- including New 
Democracy -- would have won 42.0-43.9 percent of the vote, the 
Social Democrats and the Left Party 53.0-54.9 percent. 
  Counting only the parties that would probably have cleared 
the 4 percent-threshold in May, the four parties in the current 
coalition would have 42.9 percent and the Social Democrats 52.9 
percent in the Riksdag. The SCB reckons that the Left Party has 
a chance to take the others, but even without the support of the 
Left Party the Social Democrats would be bigger than the 
nonsocialists in the Riksdag. 
  Together the government parties have lost around 6 
percentage 
points since the 1991 election. However, they have increased by 
around 3.3 percent since November and now have the support of 
40.6 percent of the electorate. 
  The Social Democrats have increased by 11.3-13.5 percentage 
points since the 1991 election and made net gains from all the 
other parties -- chiefly the Liberal Party, the Moderates, and 
New Democracy. 
  The Moderates are the only party that is at almost exactly 
the same level as the old election result. Under the surface 
the Moderates have lost voters to the Social Democrats, and also 
some to the Green Ecology Party. This has been offset by net 
gains from New Democracy and the Liberal Party. 
  The Center Party has lost 0.0-0.2 percentage points since 
the 
election, mostly to the Social Democrats but also to the Left 
Party. 
  Since the election the Liberal Party has lost 1.9-3.0 
percentage points. The net losses have been to the Social 
Democrats and the Moderates, while there has been a small gain 
from the KDS. 
  The KDS share of the vote has fallen by 2.3-3.3 percentage 
points since the election, mostly to the Social Democrats, but 
also to the Liberal Party and the Green Ecology Party. The Left 
Party has lost 0.1-1.1, chiefly to the Social Democrats. 
  Since the election New Democracy has lost all of 3.9-4.9 
percent, chiefly to the Social Democrats and the Moderates. 
  The Green Ecology Party has lost 0.3-1.3 percentage points. 
The net losses have gone to the Social Democrats, while a small 
gain has been made from the Moderates and the KDS.

<F P=106> [Dick Ljungberg report: "SSU Voted No to EU"] </F>
  [Excerpt] "At present I see only European Union [EU] 
membership offering the possibility of working as a democratic 
socialist," chairman Karl-Petter Thorwaldsson said when the 
Social Democratic Youth League (SSU) held its extraordinary 
congress on the EU on Saturday [4 June]. But he did not win 
over to the yes line the 250 delegates who had gathered at 
Cirkus in Stockholm. 
  Late on Saturday night after 12 hours of debate the congress 
voted, as had been tipped, by 131 votes to 117 against EU 
membership. Two delegates abstained. 
  Social Democratic Party secretary Mona Sahlin told 
TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA after the vote that she has great 
respect for the decision even through she herself takes a 
different view of the EU question. 
  The SSU adopted a strategy that was more or less the same as 
that of its Social Democratic mother party. At the regular SSU 
congress last year it was decided that an extraordinary congress 
should be held once the negotiations with the EU were complete. 
  The SSU leadership, like the party's, has spoken out in 
favor 
of membership. The SSU board was split: 10 for and 3 against 
membership. 
  There is one decisive difference between the party and its 
youth organization. The same delegates will attend the Social 
Democrats' extraordinary congress 18-19 June as attended the 
regular congress last year. 
  The SSU delegates -- the vast majority of them born in the 
seventies -- had, however, been elected at annual conferences 
around the country on the basis of their attitudes to the EU. 
The SSU leadership had therefore a pretty clear picture of the 
situation prior to Saturday's extraordinary congress. 
  The heavyweight delegations from Stockholm and Goteborg had 
called for a no in their motions. Remarkably enough Skane 
arrived with a delegation consisting entirely of no sayers, 
while Norrbotten fielded a majority from the yes side. Usually 
interest in EU membership becomes cooler the farther north in 
the country one travels. 
  For the youth organization as for the mother party the 
important thing is to keep ranks united in the future despite 
the split on the EU question. 
  "There are those who hope that we will battle to the death 
here today. They want nothing more than to see the SSU and the 
Social Democratic movement politically wounded in the run-up to 
this fall's Riksdag elections," Thorwaldsson said when he opened 
the congress. "But they have underestimated our strength in 
being able to hold dangerous free debates and then reach 
decisions in comradeship." 
  He said that the congress was about whether the EU is the 
right or the wrong way to go in order to achieve the common 
goal: to tame market forces and set up rules for international 
capitalism. 
  There were delegates who said that the SSU should not reach 
any decision at all on the EU. After all the decision does not 
tie members' hands in the referendum. 
  It was decided that the SSU will not be a campaigning 
organization in the referendum, but members of the 
organization's board will follow the organization's line when 
they represent the SSU on the EU question. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl have said that Spain and Germany agree 
totally on European construction. At the end of the 10th 
Spanish-German summit held yesterday and today in the town of 
Schwerin, both leaders emphasized that it is more important for 
EU [European Union] countries to consolidate monetary stability 
and to further their economic recovery than to stick to the 
deadlines set for the introduction of a single currency. 
  Gonzalez and Kohl agree on Jacques Delors' replacement as 
president of the European Commission, but the name has not been 
made public. 
  Concerning the SEAT car factory, Gonzalez and Kohl hope that 
the crisis will be resolved, while keeping as many jobs as 
possible. Representatives of the Spanish Government and the 
German multinational Volkswagen will meet in Madrid this week 
and next to try to resolve the problem.

<F P=106> ["Lt."-signed report: "Kohl and Gonzalez To Push European </F>
Integration"] 
  [Text] Schwerin, 7 Jun -- Germany, France, and Spain are 
seeking to achieve "the highest possible degree of agreement" 
regarding European policy and leadership in the European 
Council. Beginning on 1 July, the three countries will each 
have the presidency of the council for six months in succession. 
Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Spanish Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez said at the end of the German-Spanish talks in 
Schwerin on 7 June that in view of the "specially friendly 
relations between the three countries," there was a "great 
chance for the three to start work jointly." Kohl briefed the 
Spanish prime minister on the talks he held with French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur and President Francois Mitterrand last 
week. The chancellor said he had "personally the impression" 
that he had also reached a "very high degree" of agreement with 
Felipe Gonzalez on problems related to the "building of Europe." 
  Kohl said that prior to the meeting of EU chiefs of 
government on the Greek island of Korfu on 24 June, there would 
be "intensive" talks with the governments of the partner states 
in the European Union [EU], not least to achieve agreement on 
the succession of outgoing EU Commission President Jacques 
Delors. Kohl said he had also discussed this topic with 
Gonzalez. He added that bringing about such a coordinated 
approach prior to the Korfu meeting also referred to the white 
paper submitted by Jacques Delors, which contains, among other 
things, proposals on employment, economic recovery, and the 
improvement of the infrastructure within the EU. 
  At the Schwerin meeting, differences of opinion between 
Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt and the Spanish economics 
minister came to light on whether the EU Commission should in 
the future have the right to raise loans on the capital market. 
Reportedly, the option sought by both sides was not to give the 
relevant permission generally, but at best only on a 
case-by-case basis. 
  Kohl said he agreed with Gonzalez that a "consistent 
continuation of the policy of European integration" was "of 
importance for the whole continent." He had discussed with 
Gonzalez the problem of bringing the Central and East European 
states closer to the EU. It was "an essential goal" of both 
politicians to further deepen relations with the EU neighbors; 
this held also true for the Mediterranean countries, which are 
of particular interest to Spain. 
  Germany, France, and Spain also intended to cooperate in 
preparing the EU conference in 1996, which would examine the 
question of whether the conditions for further steps on the road 
to monetary and economic union were met. Kohl said it was a 
"good coincidence" for the three countries to hold the EU 
presidency in succession; this should, however, not be 
misunderstood as "hegemony of the three." 
  The chancellor stressed that monetary union, which is 
envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty, is linked to stability 
criteria. He said these criteria were more important for the 
implementation of monetary union than the "time schedule." Kohl 
said he was "absolutely satisfied for people to say that we are 
working for it as fast as possible." Gonzalez added that for 
the Spanish Government, too, stability was the most important 
thing. He said there was "a certain strictness" regarding the 
convergency criteria, and "a certain flexibility" regarding the 
timeframe agreed upon. 
  Kohl also said that the Federal Republic had reached the 
limits of its possibilities regarding financial aid for the 
Central and East European states. The Federal Government 
believed that new funds for EU programs or projects should be 
paid by member states on a new basis of assessment. He said in 
this context that it was advisable to make the per capita income 
in member states the basis of assessment. Commenting on 
economic difficulties of the Spanish Volkswagen subsidiary, 
Seat, Gonzalez said the Spanish Government would hold talks with 
the Volkswagen management. The Spanish Government was willing 
"to a certain extent" to do something to preserve the jobs; 
however, only such aid could be granted as was in line with EU 
directives.

  [Text] Defense Minister Volker Ruehe and his Swedish 
counterpart Anders Bjoerck agreed today in Stockholm to closer 
arms cooperation. Sweden has awarded a contract to the German 
arms industry worth 2 to 3 billion German marks [DM], which 
American and French firms had bid for without success. 
  [Begin recording] [Gabriela Gube, identified by caption] 
Defense Minister Ruehe and his Swedish counterpart Anders 
Bjoerck hope that this agreement will integrate Sweden into 
Europe. Sweden's support for the Baltic republics is intended to 
secure Europe to the East. 
  [Ruehe] If the Baltic states see that the way to the West is 
not only via the center [as heard] but in this case via the 
north, then all Scandinavian states, particularly Sweden, will 
be doing something here which is in the interests of all of 
Europe. 
  [Gube] German-Swedish cooperation extends to all kinds of 
arms. Areas in which the two countries used to compete, for 
example in submarine construction, they will now develop 
together. Swedish knowledge in air defense systems and 
simulators will help German arms. 
  The core of the deal, however, is the Leopard 2. Sweden 
thinks that 50 new and 200 used models of the best tank in the 
world will prove themselves in the tough northern climate. The 
background to the DM2.5-billion deal is the concern about the 
unpredictability of the East, particularly Russia, in spite of 
the party mood. 
  [Bjoerck, in English with superimposed German translation] I 
hope the Russians will not say about this deal that we Swedes 
have not waged war for 200 years. [sentence as heard] 
  [Gube] It is a bitter fact that the end of the East-West 
conflict does not mean detente but a greater degree of 
insecurity. That, at least, is how it is in Scandinavia. The 
German defense minister is of course pleased about the Swedish 
purchase of arms, not only for commercial reasons. The 
intractable Swedes are slowly being drawn toward Western 
alliances, including military ones. That would have been 
inconceivable even two years ago. Security is more important 
than neutrality, even in Sweden. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Charima Reinhardt and Hannes Gamillscheg: </F>
"Sweden Buys German Tanks -- Bonn Promises Compensation"] 
  [Text] Bonn/Stockholm, 7 Jun -- The FRG and Sweden have 
agreed on a joint arms deal worth about 1.5 billion German 
marks. As the FRG Defense Ministry confirmed in Bonn on Tuesday 
[7 June], in return for the 120 new and 160 old Leopard II 
tanks, 809 MTLB armored personnel carriers, and 350 Russian BMP 
armored vehicles from the stocks of the National People'e Army 
(NVA) that the Swedish Government wants to buy; the FRG commits 
itself to concluding a compensation deal of equal size over the 
next 10 years. 
  In order to get the billion-mark order for 160 or perhaps 
even 200 new tanks from Sweden for the German armament industry, 
FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) 
has made concessions. 
  In April last year it still looked as if the FRG were to be 
defeated by the competition of Britain and the United States for 
the armament deal, because Ruehe hesitated to agree to Sweden's 
demand for a corresponding compensation deal. At that time the 
Swedes were irritated that the German side required "rather a 
lot of time" for the negotiations. 
  The skeleton agreements, signed by Ruehe and his Swedish 
counterpart Anders Bjorck in Stockholm on Monday, now provide 
for 100-percent compensation as demanded by Sweden, in addition 
to the almost free old NVA materiel, but they do not set down 
specific projects for this purpose. Details are to be 
determined in agreements that are to be extended from one year 
to the next. The point will not be the purchase of Swedish 
"large-scale systems" for the Bundeswehr but equipment 
components, e.g. for the Navy or the Air Force, a spokesman of 
the ministry in Bonn said. Thus, one might conceive of the 
purchase of engines, drive aggregates, or guided missiles. 
  For Bonn there is very little prospect of a compensation 
deal 
involving the Swedish JAS-Gripen fighter plane, which is favored 
by Sweden, since the FRG is involved in the development of the 
"Eurofighter 2000" aircraft, and next year the decision on the 
procurement of this "Eurofighter" must be made. Future 
cooperation in the development of a new generation of combat 
aircraft and submarines is being considered, however, it was 
said in Stockholm. 
  It was also learned from the Swedish Defense Ministry that 
75 
percent of the compensation deal will involve the sale of 
Swedish armament goods and 25 percent the sale of civilian 
high-tech products. 
  In addition, both sides agreed that only 30 of the new tanks 
for the Swedish Army will be built by Krauss-Maffei in the FRG; 
all others are to be produced in Sweden with a license. 
  Instead of being scrapped, the 350 Russian armored vehicles 
from NVA stocks are to be offered to Sweden to replace its 
vehicles which have been used up in the UN mission in Bosnia. 
  Bjorck justified the purchase by citing better protection 
for 
troop transports -- in Sweden the armored vehicles are to 
replace tarpaulin-covered trucks -- as well as the favorable 
price. The Swedish Army has bought the NVA vehicles at the 
"unit price of a used Volvo," Bjorck said.

  [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- German Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe has spoken in support of including volunteers in the 
Bundeswehr. Professional associations should be set up to 
represent a high proportion of volunteers alongside professional 
soldiers, Ruehe said in Hamburg this evening. He referred to 
Denmark, where brigades with 5,000 volunteers were already in 
existence for international missions. 
  Ruehe stressed that the Bundeswehr had to become more 
"differentiated" to be deployed in a more versatile way. Belief 
in an army that carries out only one mission is outmoded in view 
of the changed international situation. Ruehe said it was 
"nonsense" to talk of the danger of a two-class army. Every 
section of the armed forces must receive the equipment and 
structure needed for its task. The defense of Germany and the 
Alliance would however remain the main mission of the Bundeswehr. 
  Ruehe spoke in favor of entering into a dialogue with Russia 
and the other CIS states on nuclear security and the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons as soon as possible. He was 
confident that there would be an enlarged membership of NATO 
within the framework of the Partnership for Peace by the year 
2000.

  [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
(Christian Democratic Union) is pressing for Bundeswehr 
participation in international UN missions. In a speech marking 
the renaming of the General Schwartzkopf barracks as the 
Lieutenant General Count von Baudissin barracks, Ruehe called 
for German "sharing of responsibility for the protection of 
freedom, against genocide and against disregard for human 
rights." 
  If Germany does not take on this responsibility, then it is 
isolating itself in the community of nations. International 
Bundeswehr missions are therefore not a secondary military 
issue. They take account of increased international 
responsibility and are decisive for determining Germany's 
abilities as a member of Europe and its credibility as an 
alliance partner. 
  Ruehe added that during their UN missions in Iraq, Bosnia, 
Cambodia, and Somalia the Bundeswehr soldiers had "proven their 
military capability and their great ability to empathize." In 
this way they visibly showed their support for the values of the 
constitution and solidarity in the community of nations.

  [Excerpt] Moscow (DDP/ADN) -- Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the 
Russian parliament [State Duma], described relations 
between Germany and Russia as exemplary. "There are good 
opportunities to further develop the constructive and 
businesslike relationship which also exists between the two 
countries' parliaments," Rybkin said today in an interview with 
the DDP/ADN news agency in Moscow. This aim will also be served 
by his first visit to Germany as chairman of the State Duma. 
Rybkin will come to Germany next week on Wednesday [11 June] as 
the head of a Duma delegation. 
  Germany's experiences in the development of a democratic and 
economically strong social state could be very useful for 
Russia. "In this connection, we want to acquaint ourselves with 
the move of the economy in the former East Germany from central 
planning to market economy principles," said Rybkin, who was 
elected chairman of the Duma on 14 January. The solution of 
this problem is a priority for Russia, too, to further advance 
reforms. 
  Rybkin, who described his relationship with President Boris 
Yeltsin as "very good and constructive," came out in favor of 
continuing the democratic and economic reforms in his country. 
However, the changes must be well considered and implemented 
with the required social provision. "The time of quick 
decisions is past," the Duma chairman stressed. Russians have 
the capabilities and the will decisively to improve their lives. 
"But this requires effort from everyone every day -- from the 
president down to the ordinary citizen." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [`DW' report: "Hungary Returns Toxic Waste to Germany"] </F>
  [Text] Budapest -- Hungary is returning to Germany toxic 
waste that was shipped there illegally by a German-Hungarian 
firm in June 1993. The waste stems from chemicals, paint 
residues, and other dangerous substances from a closed-down 
plant of the former GDR. After news of the illegal transport 
had been received, the approximate 200 tonnes of waste were 
placed in temporary storage in Hungary. It was said in Budapest 
that those responsible for the toxic waste scandal cannot be 
made answerable for it, because the relevant legislation 
contains loopholes and the persons responsible have disappeared. 
The toxic waste, which Germany is getting back "after long 
talks," is to be handed over at the Austro-German border. 
Storage and transport costs amount to about 170,000 marks. 
  In 1993, Lower Saxony exported almost half its toxic waste 
to 
other German laender and abroad. Altogether, some 417,562 
tonnes of special waste were disposed of, said Schulze-Rickmann, 
the general manager of the Lower Saxon Company for the Disposal 
of Special Waste, yesterday. In addition, there were several 
hundred thousand tonnes of toxic waste that were disposed of by 
producers internally.

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Turks Control Heroin Trade"] </F>
  [Text] Wiesbaden -- Members of extremist organizations 
banned in Germany are suspected of not only being involved in 
the political underground in Germany, but also in international 
heroin deals, Klaus Juergen Timm, chief of the Criminal Office 
of the land of Hesse, told DIE WELT. Members of the Turkish 
right-wing extremist organization, Green Wolves, and of the 
militant Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] have been identified 
in this connection. 
  Turkish nationals are unquestioned market leaders in heroin 
dealings. The dealers who are linked mainly to Turkish-Kurdish 
drug organizations have also expanded their domination. 
According to the Criminal Office of Hesse, in 1993 Turks 
already formed 32.3 percent of all those suspected of being 
involved in the organized drug trade and drug smuggling. 
  Timm is convinced that "conspiratorial PKK command and 
communications structures" continue to exist even though they 
have been outlawed. Internationally coordinated activities are 
still possible. "The PKK must be considered an organization 
that is not only responsible for massive violent activity on 
German soil, but also deals harshly with its own people who 
break the rules, and does not shy from assassination," says 
Timm. "There is also evidence that the PKK is collecting money 
from Kurds living in Germany, and in large quantities. Whoever 
fails to donate willingly is compelled to donate, even with the 
use of force." 
  In addition, the PKK is being investigated for blackmail. 
Timm: "The problem is that we do not have witnesses who could 
confirm the criminal nature of the money-gathering activity. 
This is because the PKK places witnesses under pressure and is 
not afraid to use violence. One cannot normally investigate 
illegal financial dealings on the basis of acquired receipts 
alone."

<F P=106> [Elisabeth Noelle/Neumann report: "The CDU/CSU Is Leading </F>
Before the European Election"] 
  [Text] After the depressive winter months, the Germans' 
mood has given way to downright boisterousness in May. However, 
not all are equally optimistic. Among Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] adherents, 54 percent 
expect an economic improvement. In February, only 27 percent 
had such hopes. Among Free Democratic Party [FDP] adherents, 
the confidence increased from 14 to 45 percent. However, those 
who are close to the Social Democratic Party [SPD] are 
pessimistic: 14 percent in February and 23 percent at the end 
of May expected an economic upswing. 
  The dissimilar mood in the political camps is influencing 
the 
upcoming European election. From the beginning to the end of 
May, the share of CDU/CSU adherents who think that it its 
"particularly important" increased from 35 to 53 percent. Among 
FDP adherents, 44 percent (early May: 36 percent) are of this 
opinion, as compared with 43 percent in the SPD (early May: 29 
percent), and only 39 percent (early May: 31 percent) in the 
Alliance 90/Greens. Among all voters, CDU/CSU adherents are 
most firmly determined to participate in the election. From the 
beginning to the end of May, the share of those who are 
determined to participate increased. "I will certainly 
participate in the election," said 61 percent of the CDU/CSU 
adherents at the end of May, as compared with 48 percent in 
early May. Among the FDP adherents, the "certain intention to 
vote" increased from 44 percent to 60 percent. However, there 
was stagnation among the SPD's friends. "I will certainly 
participate in the election," said 46 percent of them both at 
the beginning and the end of May. 
  This dissimilar intentions result in a turnout of about 60 
percent, as in 1989. In western Germany, it will presumably be 
five points higher than in the east. 
  After the poll concluded on 27 May, the presumable election 
result in the European election would be as follows: 36.5 
percent for the CDU/CSU, including the votes for the CSU of 
about 6 percent, 35.5 percent for the SPD, 10.5 percent for the 
Alliance 90/Greens, 6.0 percent for the FDP, 3.0 percent for the 
PDS, and 2.5 percent for the Republikaner. The upward tendency 
for the CDU/CSU is continuing. Regarding the second-vote 
intention ("if the Bundestag election were held next Sunday"), 
the SPD has a narrow lead before the CDU/CSU with 37.3 percent 
and 36.0 percent respectively. The FDP gains about 8.6 percent 
and the Alliance 90/Greens 10.6 percent; 3.3 percent want to 
vote for the Republikaner and 3.1 percent for the PDS.

<F P=106> ["wtr." report: "Chancellor Kohl Cancels `Elephants' </F>
Round'"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 7 Jun -- On the evening of the European 
elections next Sunday [12 June], the television viewers will 
wait in vain for the "elephants' round," where the party 
chairmen discuss the results. ARD and ZDF canceled the program, 
which is rich in tradition, after Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU] Chairman Helmut Kohl had declined the invitation and the 
chairmen of the two smaller coalition parties, Klaus Kinkel 
(Free Democratic Party of Germany -- FDP) and Theo Waigel 
(Christian Social Union -- CSU), had followed the chancellor's 
example. In response, Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
Federal Manager Guenther Verheugen talked of the "arrogance and 
complacency of a chancellor who has been in office for too long" 
and disregards the voters' need for information in an 
"absolutist way." The Greens talked of an "affront to 
democratic media policy." Greens spokeswoman Anne Nilges said 
that Kohl prefers to talk only "with partisans" in front of the 
camera. ARD and ZDF had invited the chairmen of the CDU, SPD, 
FDP, CSU, Greens, and the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. 
  Both the Chancellor's Office and the FDP substantiated their 
refusal by the large number of participants, to whom two 
moderators would be added; in the bare half hour that is 
available, "less than three minutes" remain for everyone. 
Useful things cannot be said there. However, ZDF chief editor 
Klaus Bresser said that the television stations had been 
prepared to extend the program to 45 minutes, as the news agency 
Reuter added. 
  However, Kohl had offered CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze 
as a substitute to the television stations. ARD and ZDF, on 
their part, declined this.

<F P=106> ["for"-attributed report: "SPD's 20-Item Concept for Growth </F>
and Employment"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- In the view of the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany [SPD], there will be no leeway for distribution 
without a significant economic recovery and higher tax yields. 
On presenting a 20-item program for "more ecological growth and 
more employment," Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine said that all 
cost-intensive projects envisaged by the SPD if it wins the 
Bundestag elections will be subject to strict ecological 
standards. However, the SPD wants to strengthen the dynamics of 
growth by improving economic framework conditions. 
  According to the 20-item concept that was presented by the 
SPD's economic experts, overcoming unemployment and a major 
growth in employment are among the priorities of the future 
government. One of the SPD's proposals is to support the 
creation of part-time jobs by means of special premiums. 
Employees sharing their jobs with someone who is unemployed 
should be rewarded by being exempted from paying unemployment 
contributions in an unbureaucratic way. These subsidies could 
be funded by the expired unemployment benefits, 
Baden-Wuerttemberg Economics Minister Dieter Spoeri (SPD) said. 
  Lafontaine said that the 1.5-percent growth rate indicated 
by 
the Federal Government is not sufficient to stop the wave of 
layoffs in Germany. Relying on a higher demand from abroad is 
not enough either. What is necessary are better framework 
conditions for investment and the strengthening of domestic 
demand. But it is also necessary to support the opening up of 
new foreign markets by an active foreign-trade policy. The SPD 
rejects a specific economic policy program. Economic 
development in the new laender has to be given a wide scope. 
  The SPD expressly advocates an improvement in framework 
conditions for medium-size companies and newly established 
firms. It is necessary to improve access to private risk capital 
through a "medium-size company offensive" and to strengthen 
joint industrial research in medium-size companies. An 
investment facilitation law is to provide more favorable 
depreciation conditions and investment subsidies as of January 
1995. The SPD wants to promote future investment by tax 
incentives, and the tax reliefs granted for research and 
development to small and medium-size firms and to freelance 
inventors, which were abolished by the government coalition, 
shall be reintroduced. 
  Special emphasis is put on a market-economy-oriented 
technology transfer, the marketing of new communication 
technologies, and the introduction of new media-oriented 
services as sectors with the greatest future job potential. 
Ecological modernization of industry and increased efforts in 
environment protection will also create hundreds of thousands of 
new jobs, Lafontaine said. 
  The SPD politician confirmed his party's intention not to 
increase the tax burden, to cut the state's new indebtedness in 
the medium term, and to make all new projects subject to strict 
financing clauses. To stabilize public funds, all public 
services, including social benefits, will have to be checked 
regularly. The high indebtedness of the state and the interest 
burden that has increased to 100 million German marks [DM] per 
year is a huge burden on the future government's work. An SPD 
government will, however, conduct a consolidation policy that is 
socially balanced. In abolishing taxation of the minimum 
subsistence level, the SPD will only be able to ease the burdens 
of the taxpayers concerned step by step, due to the high costs 
of DM40 billion involved.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Alfred </F>
Merta and Friedemann Weckbach-Mara; place and date not given: 
"Scharping -- Everybody Makes Mistakes"] 
  [Text] [BILD AM SONNTAG] You have been fiercely attacked 
for your reaction to Roman Herzog's election as president. Do 
you, meanwhile, believe that you made a mistake? 
  [Scharping] We criticized the standards of the elections, 
not the person elected. Roman Herzog has a right to 
cooperation; but even the FDP's [Free Democratic Party] Ms. 
Hamm-Bruecher spoke of "power calculations." I was angry at 
first, but everybody makes mistakes. Today I see things more 
calmly. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Yet SPD Minister-Presidents Schroeder and 
Stolpe strongly criticized you in public. Are you going to 
strike back? 
  [Scharping] These two must not be lumped together. One 
person clearing his throat does not mean that the whole SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany] suffers from pneumonia. 
Every Social Democrat must contribute to the election victory 
instead of acting out their personal vanities. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Strong words, when will they be followed 
by actions? 
  [Scharping] At its party conference on 22 June, the SPD will 
present a solid picture and will clearly support me. And we 
will adopt a convincing government program. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] What will it say? 
  [Scharping] Among the things we want are a cut in government 
costs and a modern state. The number of ministries will be cut 
from 19 to 15 or 16, and of the 60 state secretaries, some 40 
will remain in office. We want to introduce reforms in public 
service regulations. Public servants will only perform tasks 
such as police, inland revenue, and judiciary functions. The 
top positions in the public service will be temporary ones. 
Salaries for young, qualified persons starting a vocation will 
be higher from the beginning. We will weed out the system of 
grades of seniority drastically. There must be more competition 
in public services, including privatization, as long as this 
does not mean a deterioration in quality. The number of 
regulations and approvals needed, say in building, must be 
reduced significantly. In a nutshell: The Kohl policy of 
constantly increasing taxes and quickly growing debts will be 
over. This requires an efficient state. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Opinion polls indicate that you have lost 
a great deal of support. Is there still a chance that you will 
win the Bundestag elections and put your program into practice? 
  [Scharping] Serious polls show that we are still the 
strongest party. And I am clearly in the lead ahead of Mr. 
Kohl. The European elections on 12 June and the Saxony-Anhalt 
Landtag elections will be further indicators. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] But you will need a coalition partner in 
Bonn. The FDP has clearly decided in favor of the Union 
[Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union], thus giving 
the SPD the brush-off. Does this mean that there will be a 
red-green coalition after all? 
  [Scharping] No. Our position is clear and it will not 
change: We want to be the strongest party. This way we will 
always find a partner. We are ruling out a grand coalition. 
The FDP did not say that it will join the Union as an 
opposition party if the elections turn out unfavorably for them. 
This means that after the elections the supply of partners will 
be greater than the demand. But there is one thing that I will 
not grant: exclusive rights for small parties. This way the 
tail would wag the dog. The only way things will change in 
Germany is if the SPD wins a majority. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Who shall be part of the SPD government? 
  [Scharping] We will present our cabinet team after the 
summer recess. I have talked to several people. And I have 
always made sure that governments include people from outside 
politics, as is the case in Rhineland-Palatinate. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Will you establish a reconstruction 
ministry? 
  [Scharping] I will personally look after reconstruction in 
eastern Germany. And I hope I will be able to get Wolfgang 
Thierse to coordinate this, perhaps in the Chancellor's Office. 
The share of east Germans in government will be higher than it 
is now. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Would Chancellor Scharping prescribe a 
130-km speed limit on all German highways? 
  [Scharping] On most highways. But there will be exceptions. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] There have been voices in your party 
calling for a ban on the Republikaner. Are you in favor of such 
a ban? 
  [Scharping] I am in favor of having them observed closely by 
the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. This has 
turned out to be successful over the past few months. The 
Republikaner have been unmasked. We must succeed in keeping 
them out of all parliaments.

<F P=106> [Report by Martin S. Lambeck: "Resistance Against Scharping </F>
Forming in SPD"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- After a meeting of the party's managing 
board, Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf 
Scharping for the third time this week felt compelled to call 
for unity within his party. This time, his appeal was 
particularly self-critical and dramatic. The SPD leadership has 
found "unanimously" that the party has lost the clear lead in 
voters' support over the past few weeks "also through its own 
fault." Scharping threatened to tick off critics in public 
should they blemish the image of party unity in the future. 
  Commenting on statements by Lower Saxony Minister-President 
Gerhard Schroeder, Scharping said that this reminds him of 
earlier traditions in the party that have been acted out "ad 
nauseam" and which "are not very helpful." In an interview 
Schroeder had said that Scharping should conduct an election 
campaign against Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian 
Democratic Union --CDU) instead of fighting with President elect 
Roman Herzog, or even soccer trainer Berti Vogts. 
  Scharping admitted that the situation "is not as favorable 
for the SPD as would be desirable." The candidate for 
chancellor also admitted that he has made mistakes -- thus, he 
had reacted "angrily" to the election of Union candidate Roman 
Herzog as president. At the same time, he is convinced that he 
will win the elections. But in SPD leadership circles, 
criticism of the SPD election campaign is growing. An 
increasing number of members speak of a "current low" in voters' 
support for the party. 
  Critics say, only secretly so far, that Scharping has bad 
advisers and that his election campaign schedule is far too 
tight. The candidate's surroundings complain that the press work 
done for Scharping is lousy. Thus, no one considered it 
necessary to mention that the SPD chairman spoke before an 
audience of 30,000 in Dortmund last week. Quote: "The 
marketing of our top man is simply bad!" The whole campaign is a 
weak imitation of the Clinton campaign in the United States, 
without taking into account the fact that the American situation 
cannot simply be transferred to Germany. Also, it was not 
realized in time that the motto "Time for a Change" is not very 
suitable at a time when the German economy is recovering. 
  The same fears have been voiced concerning Gerhard Schroeder 
and Oskar Lafontaine, SPD economics expert and Scharping deputy. 
What is striking is that the two minister-presidents, known to 
be opponents, have been praising each other on several occasions 
recently. Both officially deny that they doubt the victory of 
their candidate Scharping. But at the same time the behavior of 
the two rivals is giving rise to rumors in the SPD. 
  The latest one: If Scharping fails at the October Bundestag 
elections, Gerhard Schroeder, who will remain in Lower Saxony, 
wants to become party chairman. Lafontaine, who wants to win a 
Bundestag seat, is then to become parliamentary group chairman 
and leader of the opposition. Commentary from the SPD 
leadership: "Even if the two were planning such a thing, they 
will then fight in the chair like hell." Critics say that 
Schroeder and Lafontaine have only one thing in common: "Each 
of them thinks he is the greatest." 
  Scharping, who is said to be an "extremely hard worker" even 
by his critics, is meanwhile counting on the elections in 
Saxony-Anhalt on 26 June. There the SPD quite rightly expects 
to win a clear victory over the Bonn coalition parties.

<F P=106> [Martina Fietz report: "Kanther Wants Security in One </F>
Piece"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- FRG Interior Minister Kanther has 
appealed to the laender ruled by the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] to agree to the anticrime law in the Bundesrat on 
Friday [10 June]. The law does not contain anything that would 
not be acceptable to the SPD, the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU] politician said. 
  Kanther indicated that he does not think anything of 
"unraveling" the package of laws and of adopting it one part 
after the other. Thus, Hesse, for instance, wants to deal with 
measures on combating right-wing extremism in a separate draft. 
The law must live up to its name, the minister stressed. It 
must be directed against all fields of crime, also against 
organized crime. Kanther said it is incomprehensible that the 
SPD should advocate the bugging of apartments "in an unsuitable 
procedure" but rejects the bugging of telephones "in a suitable 
procedure." Internal security cannot live with policy out of 
the party box. It should be kept out of the election campaign. 
  Kanther said that he is watching the SPD-led laender's 
deportation practices with concern. The CDU politician sees the 
deportation of asylum-seekers who are not recognized as having a 
right to asylum as an essential pillar of the asylum compromise. 
He admonished Rudolf Scharping, SPD chairman and 
Rhineland-Palatinate minister-president, not to establish an 
independent regulation for old cases. Scharping should 
consistently stick to the asylum compromise, which was achieved 
across party lines. 
  To have this compromise be even more effective, securing the 
borders remains a great challenge, the minister stressed. The 
border police are facing their most difficult task between 
Saxony and the Czech Republic. An agreement to return illegal 
immigrants, similar to the one with Poland, is in the offing. 
Obviously, the adoption of such an agreement has so far failed 
because of domestic problems in the Czech Republic. [passage

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Export controls in sensitive areas 
are to be intensified. This, according to the Federal Economics 
Ministry, is the aim of the revised version of the export list, 
which the federal cabinet approved today. The revised version 
also brought with it both an easing of export regulations and a 
simplification of procedures. The raising of the limits in the 
computer and electronics sectors is worth particular emphasis. 
  This will noticeably reduce the number of export permits 
required from the Federal Export Office. This will, in its 
turn, take a considerable burden off the export sector. The 
situation following the abolition of the common export controls 
by the Western world for goods suitable for military purposes 
(COCOM) was given consideration when the new version of the 
export list was drawn up.

<F P=106> ["Stue"-signed report: "German Investment Abroad Decreased"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 3 Jun -- German direct investment abroad 
significantly decreased in 1993. A table by the Economics 
Ministry indicates that new investment negative return flow was 
18.04 billion German marks [DM], which is a 27-percent decrease 
over last year's figure. Investment in European countries 
declined by almost DM5 billion. However, at DM15.2 billion, 
these countries still accounted for the major part of German 
direct investment. In the Central and East European reform 
states, German involvement went up from DM1.59 billion to DM1.76 
billion. Hungary alone had a share of DM707 million. 
Investment in America decreased from DM3.7 billion to DM1.8 
billion, DM1.7 billion of which went to the United States, which 
ranks second behind Belgium in terms of German investment 
abroad. Net investment in Africa was only DM91 million in 1992; 
and in 1993 the return flow from there was even DM3 million 
higher than new investment. The "Asia Offensive" announced by 
politicians has not yet affected investments by German industry: 
They declined from DM953 million to DM801 million. Investment 
in Australia and New Zealand jumped from DM24 million to DM179 
million. The sectors indicating the highest investment figures 
were banking, followed by the chemical and electrical industries. 
  Foreign investment in the FRG increased from DM4.6 billion 
to 
DM5.1 billion in 1993, DM199 million of which were invested in 
the eastern laender. The United States, at DM1.7 billion net 
transfer the biggest investor, particularly stepped up 
involvement. At DM2.8 billion, the European countries invested 
DM500 million more than in 1992. Net transfers from Asia 
further decreased from just under DM1.2 billion to DM358 million.

<F P=106> [Report by Reimund Westmeier: "New Laender Want To Build </F>
Their Own Satellite"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- The German Agency for Space Flight Affairs 
(DARA) wants to support the development and construction of a 
satellite by the new laender. The small satellite, called 
"NBL-Sat," is to be primarily used for gathering information on 
environmental damage in the new laender from space. Speaking at 
the ILA 94 international aerospace fair at Berlin-Schoenefeld on 
Saturday [28 May], DARA General Director Jan-Baldem Mennicken 
said that he envisages concentrating the resources available to 
eastern Germany on this project. 
  The plan is in line with Dara's goal of commercializing 
space 
flight and achieving the greatest possible benefits for the 
economy with the help of a state-subsidized space program, 
explained Mennicken. 
  Last year, DARA and the European Space Agency, ESA, provided 
52 million German marks [DM] to the new laender, the sum being 
distributed among 29 industrial companies, 14 research 
institutions, and eight universities. The space budget for the 
new laender amounts to just DM80 million and is thus less than 
4.4 percent of the total budget, says Ralf Joachim, the head of 
the DARA coordination bureau. 
  Speaking to NEUE ZEIT, Klaus Berndt, head of space 
technology 
sales at the Jena-Optronik GmbH, said that with the NBL-Sat 
project, DARA has finally stopped applying "the principle of 
giving everyone a slice of the cake." With this new plan, which 
will involve the participation of nine east German space 
technology companies and institutes, DARA will be able to show 
something concrete and will have an opportunity to demonstrate 
that it is acting in the interest of the laender. Berndt 
stressed that the participation of east German companies in the 
satellite project would serve as a reference for them. There 
were no doubts in his mind about their competence with respect 
to space distance measuring and analysis technology, as well as 
optical sensors. To develop the new satellite, one will, of 
course, need the support of companies in the old laender, but 
know-how and technical means are abundantly available in eastern 
Germany. 
  Klaus Meyer, the executive director of the Freiberg Space 
Sensor GmbH, who initiated the project, assumes that the NBL-Sat 
project will use up about 50 percent of the space research 
funding available to the new laender. He expects the costs to 
reach a maximum of DM100 million over the next four years. The 
sum is tiny compared to the benefits to the environment. Thus, 
it might finally be possible to shed some light on radiation 
levels in Saxony's mining region. Meyer said that Saxony would 
have been able to launch such a small satellite project by 
itself if DARA had not become involved. However, with DARA 
participation, the use and benefits of such a satellite can be 
extended to all five new laender.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] First we come to the D-Day celebrations in 
Normandy. NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG notes: The events of the 
past naturally formed the focus of the ceremonies. But it was 
mainly Bill Clinton who bridged the gap between the past and the 
future, saying that the fight for freedom was still continuing. 
The Longest Day is not yet over, said the first U.S. President 
to stem from the postwar generation. The victims of the 
terrible fighting could not have been honored in a better way. 
Clinton demonstrated the great impact that the victory of the 
Allies continues to have to this very day, says NEUE 
OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG. 
  KOELNISCHE RUNDSCHAU writes: There is no reason to glorify 6 
June 1944, the Longest Day. Instead, today one must reflect and 
ask oneself where cruel tyrants can and must be stopped, and 
when one should carry the banner of freedom and democracy 
further with determined action. These questions continue to be 
faced by the Allies of World War II and those who have coalesced 
with them since that time. The answers are more difficult to 
find today than they were at that time, also because the number 
of tyrants seems to be increasing without pause, says KOELNISCHE 
RUNDSCHAU. 
  DEISTER UND WESER ZEITUNG, which appears in Hameln, notes: 
D-Day, 6 June 1944, was a veritable death sentence for the 
first Allied troops to land on the beaches. Under defensive 
fire from German artillery and in close combat, a large number 
of soldiers lost their lives. Some died for freedom, and others 
in defense of the Nazi dictatorship. Fifty years have elapsed 
since then, and although Germany in the meantime has returned to 
the orbit of equal countries, also in a political sense, and has 
undergone a reconciliation with its former enemies, no German 
representative had a place at the D-Day celebrations in Great 
Britain and Normandy. It is simply stupid to criticize Helmut 
Kohl for not having made a greater effort to get invited to the 
ceremonies, says DEISTER UND WESER ZEITUNG. 
  The DIE WELT daily writes: One can note in a critical tone 
that the commemoration of the Longest Day on the coast of 
Normandy was more than a mere taste of Hollywood. But who is 
going to criticize the fact that the former war enemies are 
using today's media resources to once again cast a favorable 
light on the high quantity of blood spilt by their sons in the 
vivid past? This is going to be the last time to do it in this 
way. The number of those with memories of direct experience is 
dwindling. 
  Thus, there can be no repetition in the future of the 
senseless debate on whether or not the Germans should have been 
present on the Channel coast. Where would Chancellor Kohl have 
stood? At the bows of Queen Elizabeth's yacht, or on the bridge 
of the U.S. aircraft carrier George Washington steaming toward 
the former German positions? Or perhaps even in the ruins 
there? DIE WELT asks.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Helmut Schmidt: "Untying the Knot"] </F>
  [Text] On 25 May Russian Defense Minister Grachev 
presented the following demands to NATO: The North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council should separate from NATO and in the future 
guide and coordinate, together with the CSCE, both NATO and the 
European Union [EU], as well as the CIS. 
  There is no doubt that this is a maximum position. Almost 
simultaneously, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev presented in 
the U.S. magazine, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, similar, but a bit more 
vague ideas about the future role that Moscow is striving for in 
the CSCE. In addition, the following things are remarkable in 
his article: 

  -  The demand for the recognition of Russia as a 
superpower, which advocates, just as does the West, democracy, 
human rights, and responsible international action; 
  -  The term 
"NATO-mania," which Kozyrev uses in connection with Poland, the 
Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, but without citing these 
states by name; 
  -  The West should recognize Russia's "problems 
with Georgia and Tajikistan" and support the Russian role. Only 
if the need for close cooperation in the CIS is recognized, can 
a repetition of the Yugoslav tragedy be avoided. Kozyrev 
equates the nature and structure of the CIS with those of the 
EU; 
  -  The safeguarding of the rights of Russian minorities in the 
"near abroad" is a real problem for Russia. 

  Both Russian ministers expressly do not speak about the 
security interests of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
Hungary (the so-called Visegrad states), and the three Baltic 
republics. However, their statesmen are very worried about 
domestic developments in Russia, which they fear might lead to 
an imperialistic foreign policy and endanger the independence of 
their states. They watch the current Partnership for Peace with 
suspicion, because here Russia is placed on the same footing as 
they are. 
  So far, the West has, however, shied away even from 
promising 
the four Visegrad states NATO memberships or a security 
guarantee. The EU does expect to accept them as members within 
a few years, but their future role in the framework of the 
intended "common foreign and security policy" of the EU remains 
unclear for the time being. 
  The West is facing a dilemma: On the one hand, it is in the 
interest of all Europeans to effectively ensure the security of 
the Visegrad states (and the three Baltic republics). For them, 
a security policy condominium of the West with Moscow must not 
come about, because the Poles, but also the Hungarians (because 
of 1956!) and the Czechs (because of 1968!) would reject 
Russia's position as a guarantor power. Neither have the four 
divisions of Poland been forgotten in Warsaw, in which not only 
Moscow but -- in addition to Vienna's participation three times 
-- also Berlin was involved every time, nor has Prague forgotten 
the invasion of German troops under Hitler and its consequences. 
  On the other hand, Moscow's demand for the recognition of 
its 
status as a superpower and for institutionalized cooperation 
with the West is sensible. However, neither the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council nor the Partnership for Peace are suitable 
for that as long as they both put Russia on the same level as 
small states. 
  Conversely, the Russian proposal for giving the CSCE 
executive powers rights to the fringe of the Pacific Ocean is 
unacceptable; one just has to think of the effect on China. In 
a few years everyone will recognize that the United States, 
China, Russia, Japan, and the EU are superpowers. All five must 
learn to respect each other in every way as big powers. 
  The North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which was 
established 
upon proposal by the United States, and the Partnership for 
Peace may have been useful as improvised interim solutions. 
Now, however, this concept rather proves to be a knot that must 
be untied. It is time to invite both Russia and China to fully 
participate in the annual G-7 meetings, the so-called 
international economic summits. This would serve both mutual 
understanding and Moscow and Beijing's legitimate need for 
recognition. 
  Furthermore, the current system of security agreements 
between the West and Moscow must be supplemented with a general 
strategic consultation and cooperation treaty between Russia and 
the West. The NATO Consultation Council would then remain an 
episode. 
  Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia will soon 
become members of the EU. Russia is not happy about this, but 
it cannot object. It is only logical to put these states under 
NATO protection. But do not water down NATO and the Atlantic 
alliance! 
  Kozyrev has repeatedly warned against a return of the 
centuries of Russian imperialism to get foreign policy successes 
from the West, which are necessary for the reform forces in 
Russia. However, despite all Russia's current economic and 
political weaknesses, the West cannot avoid the actual 
recognition of this gigantic country's historical, current, and 
future role as a superpower.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] On the subject of the German-Spanish consultations, 
the following can be read in the MITTELDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG of 
Halle: Will European unity soon receive more impetus again? 
The prospects are not bad, because within the next 18 months, 
the Germans, French, and Spaniards will assume the presidency of 
the European Union [EU] one after another. After his talks with 
Spain's Prime Minister Filipe Gonzalez in Schwerin, Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl was already enthusiastic about the troika at the 
head of the EU until the end of 1995. Nevertheless, the 
triple-team will not find things easy, for it will consist of 
large European member-states, and in the past this has 
repeatedly given rise to mistrust, if not opposition, on the 
part of smaller countries, says the MITTELDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG. 
  NEUE ZEIT of Berlin says on this topic: Considering the 
substance of the observations made at the 11th German-Spanish 
consultations, one may be permitted to have doubts. Everyone 
wants the best. Success depends on specifics. But more 
important than all good intentions is the climate this time. It 
was good to bring the Spanish Prime Minister Gonzalez, 
representative of southern interests in the EU, to 
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and discuss an eastward expansion 
there as well. The partners must be convinced that this 
expansion does not lead to a German special path, that doing the 
one thing does not automatically mean abandoning the other, the 
consolidation of the EU, says NEUE ZEIT. 
  NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG represents the following view: The 
formation of a European triple-team consisting of Germany, 
France, and Spain, announced by Helmut Kohl and Felipe Gonzalez, 
will not encounter unanimous support in every EU country. Above 
all, in Great Britain there is profound suspicion about such a 
troika, but one cannot assume a leadership function if one 
applies the brakes all the time. Without the boost supplied by 
Germany and France, stagnation would have been almost 
inevitable, and there would have been no EU. Also in future, 
the EU needs such pioneers, not bosses, and it is to be 
considered highly positive that Spain is placing itself in this 
group of kinetic forces, says the NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG.

<F P=106> ["kas"-attributed commentary: "A Summit in the Lowlands"] </F>
  [Text] At the German-Spanish summit in Schwerin, Helmut 
Kohl will perhaps complain to his friend [Spanish Prime 
Minister] Felipe Gonzalez that Gonzalez could have spared him a 
lot of trouble about the new European Union [EU] Commission 
president, if Gonzalez had run for this office himself in time. 
The Spaniard, on the other hand, could admit that the chief's 
chair in Brussels would have promised him a brighter future than 
the fate of his minority government, which is darkened by 
corruption scandals. 
  In fact, the two Euroenthusiasts, who have been inseparable 
for years, must now seriously discuss disturbances in their 
relationship. Until recently Gonzalez favored Ruud Lubbers as 
Commission president, when Kohl, together with Mitterrand, had 
already dropped the Dutchman. It is questionable whether Spain 
will now turn toward Belgium's Jean-Luc Dehaene. There are 
enough signals of bitterness in Madrid about the reckless 
rotation of the German-French axis. At the summit in Granada in 
1993, Gonzalez agreed with Kohl on a three-part coordination of 
the three consecutive EU presidencies of the three countries. 
Now he, as the junior partner, must realize that the two 
seniors first agreed on the further enlargement of the EU 
without him. 
  Spain's resistance against EU enlargement had caused outrage 
in Bonn, the echo of which has not yet vanished. The EU's 
enlargement to the north and the east makes Madrid fear that 
Brussels' generous subsidies for the south, of which Spain gets 
the lion's share, might abate. Since the establishment of a 
competitive economy is, however, lagging behind because there is 
a lack of capital and innovation, Madrid will have to ask for 
help for a long time to come.

<F P=106> [Report by Marie Pierre Subtil: "France Moves Out of </F>
Rwanda"] 
  [Text] It needed hundreds of thousands of deaths before 
French popular opinion took a stand on France's role in Rwanda. 
The presence of French soldiers side-by-side with troops of the 
Rwandan Government Army, from October 1990 to December 1993, had 
been met with general indifference. 
  When international organizations and the press condemned 
this 
situation, stating that it was not limited to the protection of 
French nationals, their arguments fell on deaf ears. Not once 
was this especially bizarre presence the subject of political 
debate, and never did the issue become an intellectual hobby 
horse. 
  Now everyone is making France responsible for the massacre 
of 
moderate Tutsis and Hutus. This outcry is both late in coming 
and excessive -- excess that is doubtless due to the irrational 
aspect of events and the flagrant barbarism that we would like 
to understand and explain. 
  Nevertheless, France, considered as being "pro-Hutu" because 
of the president's support for the murdered Rwandan president, 
Juvenal Habyarimana, is in an awkward situation. The proof of 
this can be seen in France's sidestepping, in the early days of 
the massacre, when it evacuated its nationals as quickly as it 
could. Then there was the rejection of France by the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF], which looks likely to win the current 
conflict. 
  The RPF does not even want Paris to supply the equipment of 
the Senegalese or Congolese blue helmets. This is a logical 
rejection: Comprising mainly Tutsis, the RPF would have 
overturned the Hutu authorities at the start of the 1990's had 
it not been for the French Army, which opposed it by backing the 
Kigali regime. At the height of this support (700 soldiers), 
while French public opinion remained indifferent, the experts 
were getting all wrapped up in conjecture. They debated whether 
it was a question of preserving the French-speaking zone faced 
with the expansion of the English-speaking area (the RPF was 
backed by Uganda). Should not a Socialist France intervene to 
avoid a majority community (Hutus represent 85 percent of the 
population) from being subjected to the laws imposed by a 
minority? They asked also whether the friendship between the 
French and Rwandan presidents was strong enough to permit France 
to step in to save the Hutu regime, even though Rwanda is not a 
former French colony. 
  All three proposals are, even today, open to debate. The 
third suggestion is the most convincing, however. A real 
friendship existed between Francois Mitterrand and Juvenal 
Habyarimana. Moreover, on the morning of 7 April, the day after 
the Rwandan presidential plane was blown up, the first 
instruction issued by the Elysee [office of the president] to 
the Foreign Ministry was: Take care of the evacuation of the 
president's widow and family. 
  Ministerial sources say: "The Elysee not only assumes but 
also confirms the statement justifying France's intervention in 
support of the Rwandan Armed Forces." The Elysee, moreover, in 
no way denies its Rwanda policy from 1990 to 1993, and, on the 
contrary, justifies its stance by citing the results obtained 
from Kigali in exchange for French support: the end of the 
party-state and the commitment of the Hutu authorities to start 
negotiations with the RPF. Elysee sources confirm: "Without 
the presence of French troops, the Arusha Agreement would never 
have been signed and the UNAMIR [UN Aid Mission in Rwanda] would 
never have existed. How, by implementing this policy, can 
France be held responsible for the massacres? On the contrary, 
for four years we have tried to avoid it." 
  And so it was. However, did France really apply all the 
pressure it could? In particular, it is surprising that despite 
the pressure that was applied, a holder's ethnic origin remained 
on Rwandan identity cards -- a useful tool for the 
exterminators! Similarly, we may wonder how it was that in 
January 1993 an international commission of inquiry uncovered 
atrocities committed against Tutsis while 150 French soldiers 
were present in Rwanda and 14 million French francs [Fr] had 
been spent by Paris in 1992 in military cooperation with Kigali. 
<H5>  Two Schools of Thought </H5>
  It is an open secret that the Rwandan Armed Forces were 
equipped by France. The Socialist government did begin to 
change its policy in 1992, a few months before the victory of 
the Right, when work was begun that led to the Arusha 
negotiations. However, the military "establishment" [previous 
word in English] did not follow suit: The French military, which 
was opposed to the arms embargo decreed by France a year ago, is 
still opposed to it today. Ministerial sources say that "there 
are currently two schools of thought in France: On the one 
hand, you have those who still want to rearm the Rwandan forces, 
while on the other hand you have all those who believe that 
nothing can be settled without the RPF." 
  Faced with this choice, the French Government made up its 
mind: Rearming Paris's former ally is out of the question. 
France flatly refused Tanzania's request that Paris arm the 
scattered Rwandan Army -- a solution that was hoped for by many 
countries in the region that fear the RPF becoming too 
influential. 
  Having chosen not to take sides with any of the 
belligerents, 
France has very limited room for maneuver; its only means of 
applying pressure being on the other side of the border in Zaire 
which is the transit hub for weapons to the Rwandan Armed 
Forces. Meanwhile, the Americans and the British are trying to 
pressure Uganda through which weapons to the RPF are shipped. 
Here again, French influence is now considerably reduced, since 
all cooperation between France and Zaire has been suspended. 
  Marked by its recent "pro-Hutu" stand and handicapped by a 
lack of relations with Zaire, France today seems unable to exert 
any influence at all in this region. This is doubtless why it 
prides itself in doing most humanitarian work, by granting 
unprecedented funds to the non-governmental organizations 
operating in Rwanda and Burundi. It is as if the government, 
lacking the necessary political resources, is now passing the 
torch to these organizations.

  [Text] Paris, June 7 (AFP) -- French voters will choose a 
successor to President Francois Mitterrand in a two-round ballot 
next year on April 23 and May 7, Interior Minister Charles 
Pasqua said on Tuesday [7 June]. 
  Setting the date for the presidential ballot, Pasqua told 
the 
French Senate, or upper house, that the Socialist head of 
state's second seven-year term ends at midnight on May 20, 1995. 
  Mitterrand, aged 77, has shrugged aside any idea of standing 
for a third term. 
  First elected head of state in 1981, he has been sharing 
power with a conservative coalition government since the ouster 
of the former Socialist administration in elections in March 
last year. 
  He also shared power with a conservative government from 
1986 
to 1988.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Pierre Briancon: "U.S. President in National </F>
Assembly -- Clinton Safe on Atlanticism"] 
  [Text] As the only diplomatic area in which the U.S. 
President has retained his credibility, relations between Europe 
and the United States are expected to be at the core of his 
address to the French National Assembly today. 
  Bill Clinton will deliver today to the National Assembly the 
only "political" speech of his European tour, at a time when his 
ability to show real leadership in foreign affairs has been 
increasingly in doubt. Several international crises -- North 
Korea, Bosnia, Haiti -- have proven tough tests for America's 
determination and leadership, casting an unflattering light on 
Bill Clinton's weaknesses as well as those of his diplomatic 
team. 
  In Paris, his aides indicated, he will likely insist on the 
future of Europe and transatlantic relations. This is a 
presumably safe issue, as it is the one on which the U.S. 
President has proved the least fumble-footed. 
  Europe is probably the only field in which Bill Clinton has 
not committed any blunder since taking office, one in which he 
has actually been rather successful. Due to his intellectual 
and generational background, he is the first U.S. President to 
believe in European integration, as a result of a combination of 
convictions and self-interest, and to favor it unreservedly. 
  Owing to his training, culture, and analysis, he does not 
have the protective -- sometimes imperial -- reflex which his 
predecessors, because of their war experience, tended to harbor 
with respect to Europe. He considers the Old Continent as 
politically mature and an economic competitor. Therefore he is 
ready to embrace equality, but also competition. 
  To be sure, there have been many inept moves, especially in 
the administration's first months, on the part of Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher, who bluntly told the Europeans they 
were no longer at the center of U.S. diplomacy and that Asia and 
its potential markets were now Washington's chief concern. To 
be sure, there was the lingering feeling that on the Old 
Continent itself Russia mattered more to Washington than did its 
former allies. However, since he came to power, Bill Clinton 
has managed to avoid major disputes with Europe. 
  He even displayed some imagination: His idea of a 
partnership for peace -- a way to extend NATO's sphere of 
influence without altering its structure for the time being 
while crossing old military divides -- was adopted by every 
Alliance member in January. Even Russia chose to join. The 
confrontation with Europe -- and France in particular -- on GATT 
is now forgotten, with people mostly remembering that the 
agreement meant to deregulate world trade was eventually signed 
by all parties. 
  However, relations between Europe and the United States are 
not just bilateral. At the moment, Mr. Clinton's main problem 
is one of credibility with regard to public opinion. His 
European partners are visibly unconcerned by the fact that the 
President who is commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 
Normandy landing was never himself a soldier. Nor is his 
supposed lack of a "vision" of the world and its future, of an 
operational concept that he could navigate by -- a charge 
leveled by Henry Kissinger in NEWSWEEK -- the main concern of 
Europeans. 
  What they worry about is a diplomacy that is exceedingly 
responsive to U.S. opinion, and the botched jobs observed in 
Bosnia or Haiti, with the President too often appearing to agree 
with the most vocal lobby, as dictated by the sophisticated 
political and strategic calculations of his pollsters or the 
latest pictures broadcast by CNN. 
  In the last few days, Bill Clinton and his aides have faced 
an onslaught of questions on the North Korea crisis and 
Pyongyang's statement that any sanctions would be considered an 
"act of war." This inquisitiveness on the part of U.S. media 
mostly reflects a will to find an answer to the following 
question: In a crisis that would directly involve U.S. 
strategic interests, would Bill Clinton prove equal to the 
situation?

<F P=106> [Report by Jean Leclerc du Sablon: "Chinese President </F>
Expected in Paris This Fall -- Beijing's Revenge"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin is due to 
be Francois Mitterrand's guest in France in the fall and not 
after the French presidential elections, as was suggested in 
Edouard Balladur's entourage during the prime minister's visit 
to Beijing in April. This is what French business circles and 
some Chinese sources are reporting. 
  The Chinese leaders are, it seems, in a hurry to see this 
visit materialize because it represents for them a source of 
pride since it was Paris that most energetically condemned the 4 
June 1989 Tienanmen Square massacre. 
  Beijing diplomacy has brought down the wall of condemnation 
with which the West intended to isolate the regime. Jiang Zemin 
was received by Bill Clinton in Seattle in November. In July, 
Prime Minister Li Peng is expected in Austria and Germany, where 
Chancellor Kohl intends to use the "Chinese card" to revive the 
economy through contracts signed with Beijing. 
  Despite the speed with which the "normalization" of 
Franco-Chinese relations, undermined by the 1989 protests and 
then by the sale of Mirage planes to Taiwan, is taking place, 
the economic effects of this improvement in relations will take 
a long time. 
<H5>  Longuet's Mission in July </H5>
  The chapter was "closed" in January thanks to secret 
negotiations carried out by UAP [Paris Insurance Union] 
President Jacques Friedmann, but the Chinese apparently wanted 
to speed things up for political reasons. The timetable has 
scarcely allowed time for the French to negotiate economic 
compensation with the Chinese. 
  French officials are apprehensive about the approach of the 
visit by Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet, who 
is expected to arrive in early July with almost 150 businessmen: 
The harvest of contracts promises to be small. A few good 
deals have been concluded by Alcatel. Dumez has just won a 
share of the construction of a hydroelectric power station on 
the Yellow River, worth $130 million, but it lost the 
construction of the dam proper which went to an Italian company. 
However, some French industrialists working in China hope that 
this visit will make it possible to prepare the ground for the 
medium and long term, particularly in the areas of 
telecommunications and energy. 
  Jiang Zemin, who is 68 years old, an electrical engineer and 
former trainee at the Stalin autombile works in Moscow, became 
head of the Communist Party and then the Army after the crushing 
of the Tienanmen Square demonstrations five years ago. He then 
replaced General Yang Shangkun as head of state in 1993. He is 
the official heir of Deng Xiaoping, who will be 90 in August. 
However, none of the successors appointed by Deng has survived 
at the top.

  [Excerpts] There is no coldness on the part of the Israeli 
Government towards Italy, only friendship: these were the words 
of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who recalled that a 
Jerusalem daily newspaper today said that the views of the 
Israeli deputy foreign minister, Yossi Beilin, on the Italian 
Government were irresponsible. [passage omitted] 
  Avi Pazner, the Israeli ambassador to Rome, met with Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino for the second time in three days. 
This is what he told our reporter at the end of the meeting: 
  [Begin recording] [Pazner] We had a good meeting with 
Foreign 
Minister Martino. We spoke of the relations between Israel and 
Italy -- relations which we hope will continue to be good in the 
future. We spoke of the future meeting between Martino and 
Shim'on Peres in Luxembourg next Monday [13 June]. 
  [Correspondent Paolo Borelli] Will the misunderstandings be 
overcome? Will this cultural protocol be signed? 
  [Pazner] We hope that the misunderstandings will be overcome 
because there is a willingness on the part of Italy and Israel 
to overcome these difficulties. 
  [Borelli] In general, does the Israeli Government remain 
concerned at the presence of members of the National Alliance in 
our government? 
  [Pazner] There is a debate currently taking place in Israel. 
All that has happened in the last few days is a result of this 
debate. We must now find a way of continuing the good relations 
which exist between Israel and Italy. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Political Asylum for Bettino?"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Tunis -- If he wanted it, [former Italian 
Socialist leader] Bettino Craxi would be given political asylum 
by Tunisia. And, with asylum in his pocket, he could say 
farewell for ever to Milan, the Clean Hands judges, 
investigations, and possible prosecution. Thus the Tunisian 
Government would be granting the former Socialist leader -- and 
former head of the Italian Government -- the understanding that 
he deserves as someone "persecuted" by Italian justice, and 
therefore the right to live undisturbed in Hammamet. 
  The possibility of "asylum" being granted to Craxi was 
publicized yesterday by Italian press agencies, who were 
reporting a statement made by a "Tunisian Government official 
source" --not further identified--who was quoted in the last 
issue of the weekly JEUNE AFRIQUE. The statement in question is 
very curt, almost resentful, and rather undiplomatic. The 
official source said the following: "If Bettino Craxi requests 
political asylum, we will give a response. Tunisia is free to 
grant political asylum to whomever it chooses, just as European 
countries are. In such a case, the extradition agreement we 
have with Italy would not apply." 
  As a matter of fact, Italy and Tunisia maintain rather 
friendly relations, and these have resulted in bilateral 
agreements in many fields, including judiciary matters. The 
offenses for which Craxi is being indicted are all covered by 
the treaty. 
  The source, whose statements were denied by the Tunisian 
Government a few hours later, made further "revelations" to the 
weekly, explaining, among other things, the meticulous and 
strict security service established around the Craxi family's 
home, in the following words: "We do not want to have a new 
Abu-Jahad case on our hands (Abu-Jahad, a key aide of Yasir 
'Arafat, was killed in Tunis by an Israeli commando -- LA 
REPUBBLICA editor's note): After all, an assassin might be 
hiding among the journalists." 
  However, as reported above, the source was disowned almost 
at 
once. Tunisian diplomats stressed that, so far, the Tunisian 
authorities have made no offers of political asylum to Bettino 
Craxi, nor has indeed the former Italian Socialist Party 
secretary submitted any such request to this north African 
country's government. [passage omitted]

  [Text] An agreement has been reached between the government 
and Marco Pannella. The latter and his supporters will now form 
part of the ruling government coalition. The news was released 
during a joint news conference given by Silvio Berlusconi and 
Pannella. Berlusconi said that the agreement "is a visible 
signal that the government is of the center." Pannella stressed 
that some points of the agreement "could bind us for the entire 
legislative term." 
  The agreement, Berlusconi stressed, is a reply to the demand 
for change expressed by the country. The agreement envisions, 
among other things, a single round for elections and 
establishing a UN tribunal in order to try those responsible for 
crimes against humanity.

<F P=106> [Interview with Marco Taradash, chairman of the Italian </F>
Broadcasting Oversight Committee, by Maurizio Ricci; place and 
date not given: "How I Will Free Italy From the RAI" -- first 
two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- The RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] 
stands with respect to the system of party domination as the 
Republic of Salo stood with respect to the Fascist regime. "We 
freed ourselves from the latter, now we must free ourselves from 
the former." Marco Taradash has become the first chairman of 
the RAI Oversight Committee of the Second Republic and has a 
specific plan in mind: radical reform of public broadcasting as 
the precondition for any discussion of a reorganization of the 
Italian television system. A representative of Pannella's 
"reformers" group, ready to proudly declare his membership of 
the liberal Left, though elected on Forza Italia's lists ("There 
is a Right that is democratic to a greater or lesser extent, but 
that in any case behaves democratically now. On the other hand, 
there are the post-Christian Democrats and the 
post-Communists"), Taradash has always been accustomed to 
controversy and is not frightened by the polemic sparked by his 
initiative to report the spoils system within the RAI to the 
legal authorities. Nor is he frightened by the reserve with 
which his move was received by the majority to which he belongs. 
  "Who says Berlusconi has distanced himself from it? Whoever 
says so is committing journalistic libel, displaying a lack of 
professionalism and correctness. Anyone who knows about 
terrorism knows that the people who distance themselves are 
those who, having done something together with others, 
subsequently change their minds and say: I will never do it 
again." 
  [Ricci] What about Berlusconi? 
  [Taradash] Berlusconi knew nothing about it, and there was 
no 
reason to involve the prime minister in this matter. Indeed, he 
merely said that he knew nothing about it, that he did not 
criticize it, and admitted that it was a personal initiative on 
my part, meaning that it was an initiative of the reformers' 
political movement. That is all there is to it. 
  [Ricci] So are all these reservations expressed by forces 
which, after all, belong to the same majority, not part of the 
atmosphere of ill feeling that exists at present between you and 
the Berlusconi government? 
  [Taradash] I am doing what I have always done. Already two 
weeks ago I condemned the prejudiced and discriminatory attitude 
that Fininvest adopted, especially toward the smaller lists, in 
the European election campaign. I think that Fininvest has the 
duties of a public service, even though these are not envisioned 
by the law. 
  [Ricci] Do you not think that your institutional role as 
chairman of the Oversight Committee limits your flexibility, 
your ability "to do what you have always done"? 
  [Taradash] I prefer to say that it liberates. I presented 
the judiciary with documents concerning the past, in order to 
avert a vast whitewash in connection with the RAI's domination 
by the parties. This has nothing to do with the future work of 
the committee, which is what concerns me since I became 
chairman. I see no conflict here. 
  [Ricci] Who is under investigation in the RAI? The Justice 
Ministry has not confirmed any names. 
  [Taradash] If anyone asks me whether they are under 
investigation, I have always said, I do not know. But 
journalists have always stated the opposite. 
  [Ricci] Nevertheless, [RAI Chairman] Dematte and the other 
"professors" of the RAI top management seem convinced that you 
do not have your sights set on them, as you do on previous 
administrations. 
  [Taradash] That is true. I have no issue with them. The 
problem is that when the system of party domination collapsed, 
the regime entrenched itself within the RAI. I suspect that 
even the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] eventually allowed 
itself to become involved in a system of party domination 
entirely internal to the RAI, even when this system of party 
domination no longer existed outside. Consider the fact that 
such people as Dematte and [RAI Managing Director] Locatelli, 
who have backgrounds as in academia or journalism: They have 
been destroyed. Or involved in a kind of Stockholm syndrome -- 
the psychological link created between a bank robber and his 
hostage. 
  [Ricci] So is their time over? 
  [Taradash] I am not interested in manhunts, which some 
people 
on the Left, however, would like very much. I want a war to 
liberate the RAI from this regime. The Salo Republic, too, must 
be liberated. 
  [Ricci] How? 
  [Taradash] I cannot reveal my plan for the Oversight 
Committee because that would be unfair to the other Committee 
members. What I can say, is what I think its objective should 
be: Managers, producers, officials, and journalists must be 
chosen on the basis of criteria of efficiency, productivity, and 
professional skills. This is the way to end the Salo Republic 
and to enter the democratic republic. 
  [Ricci] How can those appointed according to the spoils 
system be identified? 
  [Taradash] It is enough to turn on the radio or television 
to 
see whether or not this applies to a particular producer. 
  [Ricci] But the issue here is not the assessment of the 
average listener. I want to know what the Oversight Committee 
will do: Will it pass judgment on individual programs, say 
which are subject to the spoils system and which are not? 
  [Taradash] Thank heavens, the Committee has neither the 
legal 
nor the administrative powers to do this. The Committee will 
assess broadcasts to the extent that it can. The Committee can 
adopt a political stance. Then it is up to the government, the 
judiciary, the IRI [Institute of Industrial Reconstruction], the 
management board, the director general, or the director of the 
individual program to act. 
  [Ricci] How is this "liberation" of the RAI connected with 
containing Fininvest's hegemony, the issue of efficient 
antitrust legislation with regard to the media? 
  [Taradash] The two things are connected chronologically, 
though the RAI is a public broadcaster and has different 
problems from private broadcasters. The building of a 
commercial RAI network, that is, with commercials, means that 
the commercial competitor that is being established must have 
the same dimensions and that we cannot now consider reducing 
Fininvest's strength without first taking action on the RAI. 
  [Ricci] Would such action extend as far as shielding it in 
terms of advertsing? 
  [Taradash] Definitely not. Advertising distorts public 
broadcasting. Furthermore, only if the RAI does not compete in 
the advertising market will the resources be made available that 
will ensure that an antitrust authority will not penalize firms 
capable of being active at the international level and that will 
favor the growth of new alignments. If on top of this we add 
new technologies -- cable and satellite -- which are not so new 
abroad and which must be made available to both new and old 
users, the problem of monopoly and duopoly will acquire a 
completely different aspect. 
  [Ricci] Do you mean that these three steps -- reform of the 
RAI and its advertising, the introduction of new technologies, 
and the formation of new alignments -- are dependent on one 
another and that the technological revolution cannot be carried 
out unless the RAI is reformed and reduced and that antitrust 
legislation cannot be implemented unless the other two steps 
have been carried out? 
  [Taradash] We could draft antitrust legislation even now and 
say that it takes effective in six monthse or in two years, 
depending on the fulfillment of the other two conditions.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Pietro Armani: "A Foreign Policy Founded on </F>
New Premises"] 
  [Text] The unseemly outbursts by various members of the 
European Left against the alleged "fascist revival" in Italy 
upon the inclusion in the government of five AN [National 
Alliance] ministers and 12 under secretaries are mainly rising 
-- as was only to be expected -- on the wave of the Strasbourg 
parliament election campaign. As AN leader Fini has rightly 
said, this empty, sterile upsurge against AN must be allowed to 
simmer down, to get the election campaign out of the way, and 
the facts left to speak for themselves, the facts being the 
actual conduct in government of our ministers and under 
secretaries, which will reveal the falseness of the many 
prejudices cunningly being spread to date. 
  Indeed, it must be acknowledged that our foreign minister, 
Antonio Martino, has determinedly and effectively helped sweep 
away a lot of the preconceptions and misinformation in both the 
United States and Europe, which have been built up against the 
new governing majority over recent weeks. Martino's actions 
have also served a useful purpose in sending out precise signals 
to the international community as to the new government's 
intention to establish new foundations for Italian foreign 
policy which will make its premises and objectives clearer and 
more visible. 
  The end of the Cold War; the breakup of the Soviet Union; 
the 
emergence from its ashes of new state entities over which the 
Russian Federal Republic wants to reestablish its hegemonic 
influence; the unification of Germany and its resumption of 
political and economic expansion toward East Europe and the 
former Soviet world itself; the implosion of the former 
Yugoslavia with the birth of the new sovereign states in the 
area and the consequent return to the traditional instability of 
all the Balkan states; Turkey's new bid for an international 
role and the resumption of its potential conflict of interests 
with Greece; the Palestinian movement's progress toward autonomy 
and its new relations with Israel; Iran's dynamic policy toward 
the new central Asian republics that used to form part of the 
Soviet Union: These are just some of the many issues that are 
inexorably forcing Italy, too, to redefine its geopolitical role 
in Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. The election 
of Mirko Tremaglia as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee 
in the Chamber of Deputies is also significant in this 
connection, giving an unequivocal sign of the new, active 
attention that the governing majority is devoting to the matter 
of a nontraumatic, constructive revision of the Osimo Treaty and 
the reinstatement of millions of Italians who live and work 
abroad into the life of the nation. 
  However, this is neither the time nor the place to discuss 
the foreign policy decisions that are a matter for the new 
government and its parliamentary majority. Although we fully 
agree with these decisions, they obviously remain outside our 
field of expertise. We merely wish to stress that any foreign 
policy adopted by the Italian state with the claim to be serious 
and credible and with the intention of successful implementation 
requires the use of effective instruments to carry it through, 
particularly in the economic and military spheres. 
  Indeed, if it wants to acquire credibility abroad, Italy 
must 
prove itself capable of reducing the public deficit, of 
reversing the soaring growth rate in its public debt, of 
boosting its economy and, with it, employment and the national 
income. Only a country with a strong economy can play an 
incisive role on the world stage, where relations are governed 
by trade in goods and services, by exchange rates, and by the 
increasingly close socioeconomic links between the various 
geographical areas in the world, which has turned into a true 
"global village." 
  A country without the proper credentials as to its overall 
economic clout in the concert of nations will perforce pursue a 
wishful, drifting foreign policy lacking credibility. Suffice 
it to mention the importance attributed nowadays to the area of 
economic and financial aid to the developing countries, toward 
which we must channel resources for the creation of local 
facilities for the production of wealth capable of absorbing the 
local workforce, which is otherwise destined to turn into waves 
of migration; and the higher the rate of demographic growth in 
their countries of origin, the wilder the waves will be and the 
greater the turmoil that they create. Suffice it to mention 
also the savings capacity, and the resulting investment 
potential, that an industrialized country with a strong economic 
structure can yield to defend its share of the export market and 
its imports of raw and semifinished materials. All these are 
vehicles for "showing the flag," for acquiring credibility when 
confronting foreign policy issues as well, and may be seen as 
the natural projection of vitality at home. 
  But an appropriate specific weight in terms of the economy 
is not enough in itself for the pursuit of a credible, effective 
foreign policy. Credibility at the military level is needed as 
well, not, of course, to pave the way for aggressive policies, 
which have long ago ceased to be in our national interest, and, 
indeed to be part of normal international relations, especially 
now that we live in a "post-Cold War" world, beset as it sadly 
is by grave local and/or multiethnic conflicts that had been 
quelled for decades under the bipolar domination of the two 
opposing power alliances. The role of the United Nations, NATO, 
the Western European Union, and perhaps the CSCE in controlling 
and peacefully resolving all the tensions that have sprung up in 
the world -- and in particular those nearest our own doorstep, 
in Yugoslavia, the Balkans, northern Africa, and the Middle East 
-- can be backed up and enhanced only by credible military 
forces at the service of the economically stronger states, among 
which Italy rightly wishes to be numbered. 
  This is why our country must have at its disposal -- to 
perform this role properly, without groundless ambitions and 
empty posturing, but with the serene awareness of carrying a 
weight commensurate with our strength -- a largely career-based 
Army, Navy, and Air Force equipped with modern defensive weapons 
and machinery and manned by motivated, fully trained personnel: 
a military instrument that is no longer overweight and 
bureaucratized (as it still is today), but lean, flexible, and 
rapidly deployed in response to the changing, and often 
unexpected, requirements of "international policing." Moreover, 
the factor that could weld economic structure and military 
structure together for the purposes of the new Italian foreign 
policy would be the revival of our disaster-ridden arms and 
military electronics and interception, aircraft, and 
shipbuilding industries. 
  A lean, efficient, professional military apparatus cannot do 
without national industries to supply it with products produced 
alone or in international joint ventures, at least at the 
European level, as visions of protectionism in this field would 
be anachronistic now, given the research, development, and 
production costs typical of this type of product. Nevertheless, 
no clear distinction can now be drawn at a technical level 
between military and civilian output in many sectors of industry 
(electronics, for example): Either we give up national 
representation in the sectors concerned, thus clipping the wings 
of industrial development in the country as a whole, or we must 
agree to the production of military goods alongside those made 
for civilian purposes. A resumption of state arms procurement 
would thus make it possible to modernize our armed forces and 
turn them into a viable instrument of foreign policy and, at the 
same time, to set these sectors of industry, which have long 
been on the brink of collapse, back on their feet. (Moreover, 
most of the companies are publicly owned, and likely to remain 
so for a long time in view of the low profitability that results 
from the high level of investment and associated costs 
involved.) Lastly, as domestic demand alone will certainly not 
suffice to keep these industries working to capacity, our 
foreign policy (like, on a large scale, those of France, 
Germany, and Great Britain) should also be able to use the said 
industries to channel exports to its own specific purposes, 
without this contributing to the "gun running" logic that must 
never influence our objectives or our national interest. 
  In conclusion, therefore, economic policy and military 
capability must be regarded as necessary premises for the 
foreign policy of the advanced industrialized country that is 
Italy; without them, Italian foreign policy would be in danger 
of remaining wishful and confused, and this is something that 
the government and majority can no longer afford.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dino Frescobaldi: "Our Soldiers to Bosnia?"] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Martino's first action was 
to demand a greater international role for Italy. What might 
the substance of this greater role be? We know that Italy is 
making at least two demands. The first is that our country be 
considered for one of the permanent seats when the reform of the 
UN Security Council comes under discussion. In view of our 
current international image, it is unfortunately likely that 
this demand will remain no more than a pious wish. 
  However, there seem to be better hopes for the other demand, 
namely, that Italy participate in the special "contact group" 
established by the major powers, which is supposed to find a 
solution to the Bosnian conflict and which is meeting in 
Switzerland. But here too there are some reservations to be 
noted. It is certainly illogical that our country is not a 
member of that group, in view of our proximity, our interests in 
the area in question, and also the fact that the NATO aircraft 
deployed in operations there take off from Italian bases. 
  So there may be good reasons for supporting the Italian 
Government's viewpoint, especially since there is now plenty of 
talk about using Italian troops as "blue helmets" in that 
theater of war. Hitherto the United Nations rejected this 
possibility for two reasons. The first was that, in the case of 
Italy and the former Yugoslavia, the two countries shared a 
border. However, two new states -- Slovenia and Croatia -- have 
now occupied the space between us and Bosnia, so at least on 
paper this reason against an Italian presence on the battle 
front seems no longer to exist. However, there remains the 
other, and more compelling, reason against deploying Italian 
blue helmets. Italy was one of the occupiers during the last 
war, so that unfavorable opinions among the local populations 
might act against it. 
  However, the United Nations desperately needs not only 
troops 
but also men to carry out its peace mission. This is why, in 
the interview that he granted us a while ago, Secretary General 
Butrus- Ghali said: "Of course, in those territories there 
could be dangers to the Italian troops stemming from the past, 
as, for that matter, would be the case with the Turks, but the 
greatest danger that we have to face now is that we have 
insufficient UN forces." 
  However, recently other factors have emerged that could 
jeopardize any Italian policy directed toward our disputatious 
neighbors to the east. Is it conceivable that Italian troops 
could take part in the peace mission in the former Yugoslavia 
when there are people in our country who want to challenge the 
territorial order that was one of the painful consequences of 
the war that we lost? 
  Fortunately Minister Martino made a point of stressing that, 
despite the intention to reconsider some aspects of the 
implementation of existing agreements, there is no intention on 
Italy's part of revising existing borders. The fact remains that 
those who are talking about a revision of borders occupy 
prominent positions within a movement that now has 
representatives in the government itself. It is they who are 
jeopardizing our initiatives in the international field. The 
man who allowed himself to get so carried away as to talk about 
the "Italian-ness" not only of Istria and Fiume [Rijeka] but 
also of Dalmatia is the sanguine Deputy Tremaglia, who holds the 
chairmanship of the e Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber 
of Deputies, albeit by a single vote. So even within the 
majority there are those who are undermining the foreign 
minister's comforting reassurances. 
  This is in fact the problem which, though it mainly concerns 
the Balkan issue, obstructs the greater role that the foreign 
minister is demanding for our country. It is unnecessary to 
recall the climate of exacerbated nationalism into which the 
entire Balkan world could plunge. It may be that the Yugoslav 
tragedy is just the first chapter in a process that threatens to 
spread to other lands and that the countries with a greater 
sense of responsibility, including Italy, should strive to halt, 
first and foremost by avoiding any kind of demonstration that 
could inflame people's feelings. 
  Those acquainted with the opposite shore of the Adriatic 
know 
that it is always necessary to draw a distinction. Italy's 
influence was strong even in the immediate postwar years, which 
were marked by sharp political disputes. At that time, not only 
the literature and movies of the new Italy, but also its songs 
and products as a whole held a prevalent position. It is 
tempting to say that our culture caused people to forget the sad 
times of war and the occupation and that a kind of victory was 
won over adverse events. But all it took was a few 
demonstrations by some politically insignificant groups 
displaying revanchist intentions to prompt sharp accusations 
against Italy and the Italian people. It is as though we were 
witnessing a conditioned reflex response having the power to 
unite everyone, irrespective of their differences. This was 
confirmed a few days ago when the Croatian leader, Tudjman, took 
advantage of a few remarks by some Italian figures to express 
heated opinions in public in excessive and furious language. 
  Minister Martino is right to consider it unacceptable that 
Italy is absent from a forum in which the future of a region so 
closely bound to us is discussed. But he must guard against 
those who are in practice sabotaging his efforts to gain 
credibility. Only if he does so can he gain more credibility 
and be better heeded.

    [Editorial Report] The results of a number on polls on the 
European Parliament elections, the popularity of political 
parties, and presidential preferences have been published in the 
Portuguese press. 
<H5>  Poll on Euroelections </H5>
  The results of a NORMA/SEMANARIO telephone poll on voter 
preferences for the European Parliament elections in early June 
were published in the 4 May Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO. The poll 
was conducted between 30 April and 3 May among 500 individuals 
residing in continental Portugal and had a margin of error of 
plus or minus 4.5 percent. The Socialist Party (PS) was chosen 
by 32.0 percent of the respondents, up from 27.5 percent in 
March, followed by the governing Social Democratic Party (PSD) 
with 27.1 percent (up from 24.0 percent), the Communist Party 
(PCP) with 8.6 percent (down from 10.3 percent), and the Center 
Social Democratic Party (CDS) with 8.0 percent, almost double 
its 4.5 percent March score. The undecided vote was 22.3 
percent, down from 33.6 percent in March. 
<H5>  Parties' Popularity </H5>
  The 30 April Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO published the results of 
an EXPRESSO/EUROEXPANSAO telephone party preference poll 
conducted on 26-27 April among 435 regularly participating 
individuals residing in continental Portugal and had margin of 
error of plus or minus 4.7 percent. Results showed the PSD 
preferred by 35.3 percent of respondents, up 1.2 percent since 
March. The PS gathered 34.6 percent, down 3.3 percent since 
March, the PCP obtained 5.6 percent, up 0.3 percent since March, 
and the CDS was chosen by 5.2 percent of respondents, up 0.6 
percent. The rate of undecided voters was 16.3 percent and the 
rate of abstention 7.8 percent. 
<H5>  Presidential Preference </H5>
  The 28 April Lisbon weekly VISAO published the results of a 
VISAO/Marktest telephone poll conducted between 12 and 30 March 
among 812 individuals residing in the Greater Lisbon and Greater 
Porto areas. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 
percent. Respondents were asked their preference for president 
of the Republic. Former President Ramalho Eanes came first with 
16.6 percent, followed by Prime Minister Cavaco Silva with 9.6 
percent, and Lisbon Mayor and PS official Jorge Sampaio with 9.0 
percent. Lower scores were received by former CDS luminary and 
Eurodeputy Lucas Pires (4.6 percent), Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes 
(4.4 percent), PS leader Antonio Guterres (4.1 percent), Eurico 
de Melo, present head of the PSD Euroelections list (3.3 
percent), former Prime Minister and press magnate Francisco 
Pinto Balsemao (2.0 percent), and former CDS leader Diogo 
Freitas do Amaral (1.4 percent). Results showed that the largest 
bloc of voters were undecided, with 36.3 percent of the 
respondents stating they still did not know what their choice 
would be.

  [Excerpt] The government and the management of SEAT said 
today that the Spanish car make will not disappear. According 
to Juan Manuel Eguiagaray Ucelay, the minister of industry and 
energy, the Spanish Government is willing to help SEAT, but 
without disregarding the European Union [EU] rules set down for 
competition and as long as the work force reduction of 4,500 
jobs wanted by Volkswagen is carried out in a nontraumatic way. 
  [Begin Eguigaray recording] The Spanish Government will of 
course have to contribute what it can; I underline, it will be 
done according to the rules. 
  The cut in the work force will cost all Spaniards -- through 
the state's budget -- some 30 billion pesetas, and if we have to 
add subsidies for technological equipment -- and we are quite 
willing to do so -- it will cost us more money. [end recording] 
  The government's subsidies are to be conditional on 
Volkswagen -- the parent company to which SEAT belongs -- 
fulfilling its promises regarding research, development, and the 
survival of the make and its distribution and repairs network.

  [Text] Four people were arrested this morning in the Basque 
province of Guipuzcoa for their suspected links to ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty]. In France, a further 10 people were 
arrested; they are linked to ETA's network of people taking in 
terrorists. 
  A further 13 people had already been arrested. Four of them 
are suspected of belonging to ETA's (Kiruli) Commandos, and they 
are accused of murdering a Civil Guard in September, 1993 in 
Andoain, and of killing an employee of a Telefonica subsidiary 
they had mistaken for a policeman. 
  According to Jose Maria Gurruchaga Zapirain, the civil 
governor of Guipuzcoa, four ETA commandos used the arsenal found 
yesterday in the Guipuzcoa town of Usurbil. 
  He then went on to describe the operation as a big blow for 
ETA, because some of those arrested had been long-standing ETA 
members.

<F P=106> [Article by Ertugrul Ozkok: "Two Important but Unpublicized </F>
Decisions"] 
  [Text] Turkey is preparing for an interesting waltz with 
the two superpowers, Russia and the United States. The waltz 
will probably be the most striking in the domain of quiet 
diplomacy in the next few days. The developments that are 
expected to take place will be important enough to have a 
bearing on Turkey's relations with Russia and the United States. 
The first is the implementation of Turkey's new rules on the 
[Dardenelles] Straits and the second is the resumption of the 
truck traffic across the Habur Bridge on Turkey's border with 
Iraq. 
  Turkey is determined to implement the new rules and to 
resume 
traffic on the Habur bridge. So determined is Ankara on the new 
rules for the straits that Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin reacted 
to Russia's memorandum in early May as follows: "Let's step up 
the procedure that is necessary to implement the new rules that 
will apply for the passage through the straits." 
<H5>  Implementation of the New Rules Being Stepped Up </H5>
  Far from abandoning the new rules, Turkey is moving to step 
up the procedure that is necessary to put them into action. The 
government is taking a determined approach on the matter. 
However, the new rules will be applied without publicity. 
Meanwhile, Ankara has made initiatives to Russia to explain 
Turkey's decision. In short, Turkey will implement the new 
national rules on the passage through the straits on 1 July. 
<H5>  Open the Habur Bridge Without Publicity </H5>
  The second development is related to the resumption of 
traffic on the Habur Bridge. The bridge is not officially 
closed, but there has been almost no traffic on it since 1992. 
There is no heavy truck traffic between Turkey and Iraq at the 
present time. Consequently, Turkey is preparing to set the 
trucks rolling between the two countries again. But how will it 
achieve that? Several countries regard the resumption of 
traffic between the two countries as a violation of the embargo 
on Iraq. There was congested traffic on the Habur Bridge in the 
immediate aftermath of the Gulf War. Trucks carried to Iraq 
commodities that were not covered by the embargo, such as 
foodstuffs, pharmaceutical drugs, and cigarettes. They brought 
back fuel oil in large containers. The truck traffic on the 
bridge was suspended because the PKK was reported to have 
received a significant share from the business done by the truck 
owners in 1992. 
<H5>  Extraordinary Figures </H5>
  The decision to suspend the traffic on that bridge caused 
significant economic stagnation in the region. Some 400,000 
people earned their living from the trade across the border. 
The filling stations provided additional jobs to 20-25 persons 
in the region. Other economic benefits existed as well. Fuel 
oil costs 1,000 Turkish lira per liter in Iraq. It is sold for 
12,000 Turkish lira per liter in Turkey. It has been 
ascertained that Turkey acquired 3.5 million tonnes of fuel oil 
across the Habur Bridge in 1992. The refineries in Turkey meet 
70 percent of the demand for fuel oil; consequently, Turkey has 
to import the remaining 30 percent. Importing fuel oil over the 
Habur Bridge is the cheapest way Turkey can get what it needs. 
The amount of foreign currency Turkey saved at the time also 
has to be considered. 
  Some 180,000 trucks crossed the Habur Bridge in 1992. The 
number of trucks that cross that bridge has fallen to 
20,000-30,000 at the present time. 
<H5>  Karayalcin's File </H5>
  Considering all that, Turkey is determined to resume the 
truck traffic on the Habur Bridge. The government's decision 
would have been put into effect at the end of 1993. However, it 
was postponed as a result of intensive Western pressure, which 
was prompted by the extensive publicity ministers gave the 
matter at the time. The government's decision will be put into 
effect without publicity. It was to have been implemented 
during the past few days. The clashes between the supporters of 
Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud Barzani and 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani forced the 
officials to postpone it. Ankara is waiting for an appropriate 
time. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin has studied the 
matter 
in detail. The outcome of his research has been or is about to 
be submitted to the Council of Ministers. The government's 
decision will then be put into effect without publicity.

<F P=106> [Column by Mehmet Ali Birand: "Talabani: Turkey Must </F>
Mediate in the Dispute"] 
  [Text] An explosive situation still exists in northern 
Iraq. The Democratic Party of Kurdistan [DPK], which is headed 
by Mas'ud Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], 
which is headed by Jalal Talabani, are involved in a serious 
struggle for power. Ankara has been very worried by the 
clashes, which began over an insignificant piece of territory 
and which quickly turned into a war between the two sides. 
Turkey is worried that the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] may 
benefit from the internal clashes in northern Iraq and 
strengthen its position in the region. 
  Receiving reliable information on the clashes, particularly 
on whether or not one of the two sides has established 
superiority, has been difficult. The intelligence reports 
Ankara has received are not clear. It is difficult to determine 
which side tells the truth and which side distorts the facts. 
  DPK leader Mas'ud Barzani has held PUK leader Jalal Talabani 
entirely responsible for the clashes. He has accused Talabani's 
forces of starting the clashes in order to expand the territory 
they control. Furthermore, Barzani has claimed that Talabani 
has cooperated with the PKK and allowed that organization's 
armed units to join his forces. 
  We conferred with Jalal Talabani in Damascus yesterday 
morning. His views were different. He said that a personal 
problem does not exist between him and Mas'ud Barzani and that 
he frequently confers with him by telephone. Talabani argued 
that the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan [IMK], which is headed by 
Ethem Barzani and supported by Iran, is the main problem. 
Talabani also argued that several DPK units have joined the 
clashes with the arms they have received from Iran. He 
asserted: "Iran has interfered. It has armed the IMK groups 
and sent them to our region through al-Sulaymaniyah. Several 
DPK groups also have been involved. Mas'ud Barzani has failed 
to intervene. It may be that he is unable to do so. The matter 
is an Iranian design." 
  According to Talabani, the situation in al-Sulaymaniyah has 
been placed under control. Nevertheless, clashes have continued 
from time to time. In other words, the tension has not been 
completely defused. 
<H5>  Turkey's Mediation Is Essential.... </H5>
  Talabani rejected DPK's allegations that he secretly 
cooperates with the PKK. He said that he does not need that 
organization. Talabani asserted: "Most of PKK's militants are 
in Turkey. The rest were in the camp in Zalakh. Turkish 
aircraft have intensively bombed it. Only the wounded and sick 
militants are in that camp now. We have never been involved in 
secret bargaining talks with the PKK." 
  However, Foreign Ministry officials in Ankara and the 
intelligence units are skeptical. They have said that Talabani 
maintains an unreliable policy and supports the PKK from time to 
time. A Turkish official has asserted: "Compared with the 
peshmerga forces of the DPK and PUK in northern Iraq, PKK's 
armed groups are more ambitious and reckless. Consequently, the 
PKK gains from divisions and clashes." The same official also 
asserted that the clashes must end in order to prevent the PKK 
from benefiting from the present situation. 
  Turkey has made an effort during the past week to have 
Barzani and Talabani hold talks on the situation. The officials 
of the Internal Affairs Ministry, the intelligence organization, 
and the Foreign Ministry met several times to consider what 
Turkey can do. Talabani informed us during our telephone 
conversation that Turkey must intervene to mediate between the 
two sides. He said: "Turkey must make its weight felt because 
Iran's intervention will upset the balances in the region. I am 
prepared to meet Barzani in any part of Turkey. I am prepared 
to hold talks with him to end the dispute. I have explained my 
approach to the Turkish officials. I am waiting for them to 
respond." 
  The officials maintained their contacts in Ankara the night 
before last and yesterday. Messages were conveyed to the two 
leaders. However, a final result was not yet achieved by the 
time this column was written. The meeting will take place in 
Turkey. Talabani does not wish to meet Barzani in northern Iraq. 
He said: "I shall either go to Turkey or remain where I am at 
the present time." 
  On his part, Mas'ud Barzani prefers to meet Talabani in 
northern Iraq. He wants only the Turkish officials to attend 
the summit he will have with Talabani. Furthermore, he wishes 
to avoid creating uneasiness in Baghdad. That is why he prefers 
not to involve the Iraqi opposition groups in the matter. 
<H5>  Foreign Ministry: Talabani's Supporters Are To Blame for the </H5>
Incidents 
  Considering the intelligence reports, the Foreign Ministry 
is 
convinced that the incidents in northern Iraq were caused by 
Talabani's supporters. Officials have said: "Nevertheless, we 
shall approach the two sides and try to convince them to end the 
fighting." 
  Foreign Ministry officials are convinced that Saddam Husayn 
stands to gain from the clashes between the two most important 
groups in northern Iraq and they believe that they have 
exaggerated the dispute between them. A high-ranking official 
has explained Ankara's position as follows: 
  1. We cannot ignore an attempt by Saddam Husayn to suppress 
the Kurds in northern Iraq yet again. 
  2. Peace must be established in the region. A cease-fire 
must be imposed in order to normalize the situation. 
  3. The problems must be resolved in accordance with the 
principle of maintaining Iraq's territorial integrity. We 
cannot condone any activity that may be aimed at the 
establishment of a Kurdish state in the region. 
  The Foreign Ministry officials' approach on the possibility 
of establishing a Kurdish state is very clear. They have 
persistently reiterated that a satisfactory guarantee has been 
given to Turkey and that the possibility is no longer considered. 
  Ankara is gradually encouraging Talabani and Barzani to 
reach 
an agreement with the Baghdad administration. Officials have 
suggested that the two leaders should hold talks with the Iraqi 
Administration on all the formulas, including the concept of 
autonomy for the Kurds. However, a significant distance has not 
yet been covered in that direction.... 
  Northern Iraq is the number one problem in Turkey's foreign 
policy. Obviously, any confusion in that region will make 
Ankara feel uneasy.

  [Excerpt] Ankara, June 7 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry Deputy 
Undersecretary Tugay Ulucevik said on Tuesday [7 June] that 
Turkey called the United Nations Security Council members to 
have a positive approach toward an agreement on Cyprus that will 
not pave the way to destroy a possible agreement.

<F P=106> [Faruk Balci report: "A Stern Warning to Greece"] </F>
  [Text] Ankara -- Turkey is preparing to retaliate against 
Greece, which has recently created a wave of tension in 
relations between the two countries by supporting the Kurdish 
Workers Party militants, making an effort to extend its 
territorial waters in the Aegean Sea to 12 miles, and 
maintaining an intransigent approach on the Cyprus problem. In 
a surprise move, Turkey has decided to extend the Gokceada 
Airport's short runway to accommodate jet aircraft. Meanwhile, a 
small airport will be constructed in Bozcaada. 
<H5>  Gokceada Airport's Runway </H5>
  The General Staff conveyed a written request to the Ministry 
of Communications and Transport for the extension of Gokceada 
Airport's runway some time ago. The ministry has complied by 
deciding to dispatch a group of experts to the island to start 
the work on the runway during the current week. 
<H5>  National Security Council Assesses the Situation </H5>
  The National Security Council [NSC] met on 28 May to assess 
Greece's approach, which has created tension in the relations 
between the two countries. The NSC also established the 
measures Turkey can adopt to deal with the situation. The 
meeting discussed the possibility of the extension of Gokceada 
Airport's runway and the construction of an airport in Bozcaada. 
The General Staff later conveyed a written request to the 
Ministry of Communications and Transport for the extension of 
the runway. 
<H5>  Kostepen Takes Quick Action </H5>
  In a statement to HURRIYET, Minister of Communications and 
Transport Kostepen has confirmed the decision to extend the 
runway. He said that the 1,200-meter long runway will be 
extended to at least 2,040 meters and that a group of experts 
will be dispatched to the island during the current week. 
Kostepen noted: "The runway will be extended for logistical 
purposes and for meeting requirements in the tourism sector." 
  Kostepen asserted that the runway will be used by civilian 
aircraft after it is extended. He noted that the use of the 
Gokceada Airport by civilian aircraft will promote tourism in 
the region. Kostepen added that plans have been made for the 
construction of a small airport in Bozcaada. Regarding Gokceada 
Airport, he said: "The runway is not used at the present time. 
Gokceada is important for the tourism sector. It is also a 
strategically important island." 
  The status of the islands in the Aegean Sea has been 
outlined 
in international agreements. That is why Greece claimed in the 
past that it would enlarge the airport in Meyisti island and 
construct airports on the other Greek islands for civilian 
purposes.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has declared that 
Turkish foreign policy is not based on hostility, and the 
extension of the landing strip at the airport on Gokceada should 
not be interpreted as a stand against Greece. Demirel also 
revealed that he informed Greek President Karamanlis in a 
message that Turkey is disturbed about PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] activities in Athens. 
  Demirel replied to reporters' questions on various issues in 
Afyon today. Asked by a journalist to comment on the extension 
of the landing strip at Gokceada Airport, Demirel recalled that 
various problems were related to him during his visit to the 
island. Pointing out that access to Gokceada is a problem, and 
it takes two to three hours to go and come back from the island, 
the president remarked that the extension of the landing strip 
on the island is necessary for transportation. 
  Demirel said: The extension is not aimed at adopting a stand 
against Greece. After all, the island is ours. It is our 
affair how we will serve the island. Therefore, do not 
interpret the matter as a stand adopted against Greece. This is 
not correct. Soon, we are planning to lay the cornerstone of the 
Bodrum Airport. Will this constitute a stand against someone? 
An airport is a means of transportation to a corner of the 
country. It does not have other motives. There is no need to 
adopt a stand against anyone. For the moment, there is no such 
need. 
  Commenting on a remark that his message to Karamanlis was 
published by the Greek side, Demirel said that Karamanlis is an 
old friend and this friendship is over 30 years old. He added: 
Turkey and Greece have bilateral problems, but these problems 
are not new. They have been inherited from the past. We want 
them to be resolved peacefully. Our policy is not one of 
hostility.

<H8>  Naksibendi Tariqa </H8>
  The founder of the Naksibendi tariqa [religious brotherhood] 
is Sheykh Muhammad Baha'-al-Din Naqshbandi [Naksibendi]. He was 
born in the village of Qasr-i 'Arifan in Bukhara. The 
Naksibendi tariqa, which is very active in the Muslim world, 
gets its strengths from the fundamental principle of "devotion 
to the sheykh." After Sheykh Naqshbandi, the tariqa was led by 
'Ala-al-Din 'Attar, Ya'qub Carphi, and Muhammad Parsha. This 
tariqa is classified as a simple tariqa to follow, because it 
does not interfere with worldly needs such as eating, drinking, 
sleeping, marrying, and working. The other fundamental 
principles of the tariqa are: Shari'ah, the religious order, 
truth, and spiritual knowledge. The first pioneers of the 
Naksibendi tariqa in Turkey were Ali Haydar Efendi and Mehmet 
Zahid Kotku. There is a Naksibendi tariqa in every city in 
Turkey, and there are about 2 million Naksibendi followers in 
Turkey. The religious communities of the Naksibendi tariqa are 
known to vote for the Motherland Party [ANAP], the Prosperity 
Party [RP], and the Grand Unity Party [BBP]. The main 
Naksibendi publications are ISLAM, ALTINOLUK [The Golden 
Channel], and BIZIM DERGAH [Our Dervish Monastery]. The 
following are the religious orders of the Naksibendi tariqa. 
<H5>  Menzil Cemaati </H5>
Founder: Mehmet Rasit Efendi 
Leader: A new leader has not been named since Mehmet Rasit 
died. 
Party it supports: BBP. 
Area where it is influential: Adiyaman, Ankara, and Istanbul.

effective struggle against the PKK. 
<H5>  Carsamba Cemaati </H5>
Founder: Mahmut Efendi 
Leader: -- 
Party it supports: RP. 
Area where it is influential: Istanbul Fatih District. 
Publications: -- 
Tenets: Among the Naksibendi religious orders, this pays the 
most careful attention to the Muslim way of living. The order 
gives a lot of importance to Koran courses. The Koran readers 
trained by the order receive high marks in international Koran 
reading competitions. 
<H5>  Iskender Pasa Cemaati </H5>

Association] of Izmir, and Temel Hak ve Hurriyetler Dernegi 
[Fundamental Rights and Freedoms Association] of Adana. [as 
published]. 
Tenets: According to a recent analysis, the order's aim is to 
infiltrate the state and make it a Muslim state. It advocates 
developing heavy industry, even though it opposes a consumer 
society.

Leader: -- 
Party it supports: The order recently began to support the RP.

Leader: -- 
Party it supports: RP 
Area where it is influential: Istanbul 
Its publications: ALTINOLUK magazine and ERKAM YAYINLARI [Erkam

Tenets: Within a mystic discipline, the order explains its 
"truth of faith" without feeling the need to resort to the 
sciences. It believes that alcohol, gambling, and prostitution 
are the causes of social collapse. The order has ample financial 
means. 
<H8>  Nurcu Tariqa </H8>
  The founder is Said-i Nursi. Risale-i Nur is the 
fundamental work of the tariqa's theoretic and practical views. 
Said-i Nursi said that Nurcuism was not a tariqa. In 1907, he 
attached the word "Bediuzzaman" (which means wonder of the age) 
to his name. Said-i Nursi, the most frequent exile in the 
history of the republic, acquired thousands of supporters and 
extended his influence to the places where he was exiled. In 
addition to the areas where the Kurds live, the tariqa has large 
numbers of supporters in northern Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, India, 
Saudi Arabia, England, and the United States. The Nurcu tariqa 
strenuously opposes capitalism and also criticizes secularism. 
Said-i Nursi gave significant sermons on social justice, law, 
and equality. The tariqa was close to the MNP, MSP, and Justice 
Party [AP] in the past. Today, it supports The True Path Party 
[DYP] and the ANAP. Its publications are ZAMAN [Time], YENI 
ASYA [New Asia], SIZINTI [Leakage], ZAFER [Victory], SUR [City 
Wall], and BIZIM AILE [Our Family] newspapers. The tariqa has 
many local radio stations and one private television channel 
called Samanyolu [The Milky Way] in Anatolia. The following are 
the religious orders of the Nurcu tariqa. 
<H5>  Fethullah Hoca Cemaati </H5>
Founder: Fethullah Gulen 
Leader: -- 
Party it supports: ANAP 
Area where it is influential: Istanbul, Izmir, Adapazari, 
Afyon, and Isparta. 
Publications: ZAMAN, SIZINTI, SUR and ZAFER. 
Tenets: The order is not shy about giving small concessions to 
reach the "great ideals." It has a closed circuit TV broadcast 
for sympathizers. A secret code language is used within the 
community. Audio and video cassette productions are considered 
important. 
<H5>  Yeni Nesil Cemaati </H5>
Founder: Mehmet Kutlular 
Leader: -- 
Party it supports: DYP 
Area where it is influential: Istanbul and Central Anatolia. 
Publications: YENI ASYA newspaper and its publications. 
Tenets: The order organizes inside the government. It has close 
relations with the Muslim bourgeoisie. 
<H5>  Aczmendi Cemaati </H5>
Founder: Muslim Gunduz 
Leader: -- 
Party it supports: -- 
Area where it is influential: Elazig 
Publications: -- 
Tenets: Its hostility toward the United States is so great that 
the order might even cooperate with Russia to struggle against 
the United States. It does not see Fethullah Hoca as a student 
of Risale-i Nur. 
<H5>  Kadiri Cemaati </H5>
Founder: -- 
Leader: Haydar Bas. 
Party it supports: -- 
Area where it is influential: Trabzon and Tokat. 
Publications: ICMAL [Summary] and OGUT [Advice] 
Tenets: The order is open to embracing all Muslim groups with 
the exception of radical groups. It leans toward a 
nationalist-conservative concept. It defends democracy and 
secularism in the "real sense." It follows an anticommunist 
line and favors a national identity in industry. 
<H8>  Suleymanci Tariqa </H8>
  This was founded by Suleyman Hilmi Turahan, a Muslim judge 
of 
Silistre. After Turahan, the former deputy of AP, Kemal Kacar 
became the first man of the tariqa. The tariqa's specific 
tenets are: strength and missionary spirit, legality and 
modernism, and discipline and obedience. The tariqa believes 
that the Office of Religious Affairs has nothing to do with 
Islam, and has declared the Office and the Principles of Ataturk 
as foes. The tariqa has about 300 Muslim culture centers. It 
plays a role in politics. As far as the order is concerned, 
Turkey is Dar-al-Harb [abode of war], and the religious 
communities outside its own are not considered Muslims. When 
greeting people outside its own, "Essamualeykum" [blight be upon 
you] is used [instead of "Selamunaleykum" which means peace be 
upon you]. The tariqa supports the DYP and ANAP. By designating 
pilot regions in the Mediterranean area, the tariqa gained 
substantial amounts of supporters. The tariqa has retreated from 
its hard line in recent years. Its present leader is Huseyin 
Kumas, and it carries out its activities under the umbrella of 
courses and aid associations in schools. 
<H8>  Isikci Tariqa </H8>
  This is also known as the Turkey Group. It was founded by 
Huseyin Ilmi Isik. In his work entitled Saadet-i 
Ebediye [Eternal Happiness] he points out the fundamental 
principles of the tariqa. After Isikci, the true theoretical 
leader of the Isikcilar tariqa is said to be "Feyz alan" 
[Knowledge Receiver] Abdul Hakim. The tariqa supports whichever 
party on the Right is most likely to come to power, places great 
importance on commerce, and considers every kind of commerce 
permissible in the name of its struggle. The present leader is 
said to be "sincere" businessman Dr. Enver Oren. The tariqa has 
weekly and monthly magazines, including TGRT [Radio and 
television network of TURKIYE GAZETESI] and TURKIYE GAZETESI, 
addressing every sector. 
<H8>  The Other Tariqas </H8>
  We can group these tariqas under two main headings. The 
first group is those that are mystically inclined: Mevlevi, 
Rifai, and Cerrahi tariqas. The second group is those that are 
radically inclined: Vehabi [Wahhabi] tariqa (greatly influenced 
by Iran, Syria, and Egypt), Ihvan-i Muslimin [Muslim 
Brotherhood], and the Muslim clergy supporters. While the 
radically inclined ones are not able to find much support from 
people, mystically inclined groups are gaining support every day.

  [Text] The National Council convened a meeting 
approximately one-half hour ago to continue discussion on the 
situation after the deadlock in the confidence-building measures 
[CBM's] and the UN report which established the lack of 
political will by the Turkish side. 
  The debate opened last Friday [3 June] and President Glavkos 
Kliridhis verbally submitted suggestions. There was an initial 
exchange of views on the UN report and the future of the Cyprus 
issue. 
  Attendees at today's meeting include Ioannis Matsis and

  [Text] The political parties began discussing Cyprus 
developments, in light of the Butrus-Ghali report and tomorrow's 
National Council meeting. 
  The Democratic Rally [DISI] political bureau met this 
morning, and the meeting will continue this afternoon. The DISI 
parliamentary caucus will also meet. 
  The political bureau of the AKEL [Restorative Party of the 
Working People] Central Committee also met this morning. The 
Democratic Party [DIKO] political committee will discuss Cyprus 
developments this afternoon. 
  In a statement released after today's meeting of its Central 
Committee's political bureau, AKEL notes that our side must 
immediately become active and systematically work to avert any 
plans to continue the confidence-building measures [CBM's] 
process. The AKEL statement, which was issued a short time ago, 
states that to break the deadlock the UN Security Council must 
implement measures that will bend Turkish intransigence. The 
Security Council must also implement measures to prevent Turkish 
acceptance of a solution based on principles, the UN resolutions 
and the summit agreements, and then a discussion of the 
substance should follow aimed at achieving the framework of an 
overall solution. 
  The AKEL statement adds that convening an international 
conference would be helpful, as well as the proposal for a visit 
to the area by members of the Security Council. The statement 
also notes that even now, despite the UN secretary general's 
affirmation of the Turkish Cypriot intransigence and lack of 
political will, the Security Council will insist on the CBM's as 
a result of systematic efforts by the British and the Americans.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said that if an 
attempt is made for diversion, that is continuing with the 
confidence-building measures [CBM's], after the UN report, we 
will not follow this course. He added: We believe that such a 
development is absolutely unjustified following the content of 
the UN secretary general's significant report. 
  In a statement to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] 
this 
morning, Mr. Mikhailidhis noted that continuing the discussion 
of the CBM's cannot lead anywhere, it detracts from the report, 
and it can only cause damage. Mr. Mikhailidhis also said that 
some people believe that there is still room for the CBM's and 
reiterated categorically that we would consider it a fatal blow 
to the entire process if we continued something which is already 
obsolete. 
  Concerning a letter that Rauf Denktas conveyed to the United 
Nations, Mr. Mikhailidhis said that Denktas is starting with a 
premise that ise absolutely unacceptable to us and are in 
complete opposition to the UN resolutions. He stressed: 
Neither our side nor the United Nations, through its 
resolutions, have ever accepted the fact that Cyprus can be 
anything but a unitary sovereignty, a unitary citizenship. Mr. 
Mikhailidhis also pointed that Denktas reiterated in his letter 
his well-known demands for partnership, equal participation, and 
separate rights.

  [Text] Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has stated that 
the report UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali submitted to the 
Security Council will act as a deterrent in achieving a just 
solution to the Cyprus issue and even cause a deadlock. 
Recalling that President Rauf Denktas had accepted those 
agreements reached at the meetings held with UN representatives 
in Vienna which were within the framework of the 
confidence-building measures, Ciller continued: The Turkish 
side agrees to the package but the report creates an obstacle in 
the way to a just solution to the Cyprus issue. 
  Addressing the True Path Party National Assembly caucus in 
Ankara, Ciller discussed the Cyprus issue and criticized the UN 
secretary general's report. Ciller indicated that previous 
experiences have proved that it is impossible to achieve a 
solution to the Cyprus issue by coercion and threats. 
  Stating that Turkey supports a just, realistic, and viable 
Cyprus solution based on the equality of both communities, 
Ciller stressed that Turkey will continue to support the Turkish 
Cypriots to the best of its ability.

<F P=106> [Report by John Vickers] </F>
  [Excerpts] January 1 saw the long-overdue implementation of 
the island's new Copyright Law, the main aim of which was to end 
once and for all the booming sales and rental of pirated video 
films, music tapes and computer software. [passage omitted] 
  According to figures from the Cyprus Federation Against 
Copyright Theft [CYFACT], the police have not been inactive 
since January, having raided a total of 36 premises on receiving 
information that pirated material was on sale or for rent. 
  Only three weeks ago a video club in Xylotymbou village was 
raided and a total of 4,642 tapes were seized, together with 27 
video recorders and 3 amplifiers which were being used for 
copying. 
  CYFACT's legal adviser, Akhilleas Dimitradhis, said this 
week 
that five months after the implementation of the new copyright 
law, certain changes are obvious to all: "We've seen a dramatic 
decline in pirated products being offered for sale. The 
souvenir shops and supermarkets which had given Cyprus such a 
bad reputation internationally appear to have taken the law 
seriously and have stopped selling illegal copies of films. In 
the case of the video clubs, a number of them have conformed to 
the provisions of the law, but there are still a few which are 
stubbornly refusing to do away with their pirated stock. It is 
here that we are hoping that the police will vigorously enforce 
the law." 
  Asked to suggest ways in which the situation could be 
improved, Dimitriadhis noted that "other than better 
enforcement", the government's promised anti-piracy sticker 
guaranteeing a product's authenticity had still not 
materialised, whilst the question of classification and 
censorship of video films still remains to be addressed. 
  It is estimated that only a third of the video clubs that 
flourished in the 1980's are still in business today. Although 
original videotapes are now being imported for sale and rental 
(some 3,500 titles are now officially on release in Cyprus, the 
official video release date in Greece applying here too), 
business has been hit, ironically, by the rebirth of the cinema 
and the growing number of TV channels available. 
  Stricter regulations have put a stop to the huge export 
business in pirated films, and the sales of blank tapes which 
reached almost 3.5 million in 1991 were down to 874,000 last 
year. 
  This year figure is likely to be considerably lower. It is, 
of course, in the interest of the film companies that the video 
clubs and sales outlets remain in business, since the officially 
sanctioned home video market is a large and lucrative one, but 
they are determined to stamp out once and for all the blatant 
theft of their property. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Controversy" column by Akranis: "CBM's or </F>
Substance"] 
  [Text] No one can question the fact that in his report, the 
UN secretary general blames the Turkish Cypriot side. However, 
the government's claim that this is happening for the first time 
is false. As the UN secretary general ascertains "the Security 
Council is already facing a well-known scenario: the lack of 
agreement due to the lack of political will by the Turkish 
Cypriot side." 
  Certainly, a well-known scenario cannot be happening for the 
first time. Indisputably the same scenario of attributing blame 
clearly and directly was played in November 1992. The only 
difference was that the blame concerned Turkish Cypriot leader 
Rauf Denktas' position on the substance of the Cyprus issue, 
while now the lack of political will is being blamed for the 
rejection of the confidence-building measures [CBM's] package. 
The UN secretary general said the CBM's package was repeatedly 
modified to take into account the "Turkish Cypriot leader's many 
comments." 
  However, it is more significant to look at how we will 
proceed. The government, which had placed all of its hopes on 
alternative ways of action, cannot be vague anymore. Five 
alternatives have been proposed, but in the final analysis 
there are merely two options: the CBM's, or the substance of the 
Cyprus issue. One does not have to be particularly wise to 
realize that the Security Council aims to promote the CBM's, 
possibly through procedures and actions that will be more 
effective. 
  What is our side doing? We are concerned with the government 
spokesman's interpretation that the UN secretary general does 
not favor dealing with the substance of the Cyprus issue. The 
UN secretary general's evaluation, that the status quo will not 
change as long as there is lack of political will, does not mean 
that the substance of the issue is being abandoned. On the 
contrary, it gives us the chance to argue in favor of 
alternative means of action to promote the substance of the 
Cyprus issue, not the CBM's. That is, to combine the second and 
third options: to keep the compulsory measures of the second and 
the return to the substance of the third. This goal can be 
achieved not only because it is provided for in the report, even 
as a combination, but because this was essentially the provision 
of UN Security Council 789: The Turkish Cypriot side either 
complies with the Security Council's conditions on the substance 
of the Cyprus issue or alternative ways of action will be 
adopted. 
  The margins for maneuver seem to be narrowing. The 
government has to act immediately before the Security Council 
adopts a resolution. We repeat that the choice is between the 
CBM's and the substance of the issue. No matter how much one 
disagrees with the framework proposed by the United Nations on 
the substance of the Cyprus issue, one must recognize that it is 
clearly better than the CBM's that bear the tangible danger of 
becoming the solution, not merely a catalyst for a solution.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias left for Tehran 
at 1000 today on a two-day visit to Iran. The foreign minister 
will then proceed to Istanbul where he will participate in the 
spring conference of NATO foreign ministers on 9-10 June. 
  In a statement made shortly before leaving for Tehran, the 
foreign minister described these upcoming visits as very 
interesting. Concerning his visit to Iran, Mr. Papoulias 
stressed that it is in the mutual interest of both countries to 
maintain and develop their existing good relations. He added 
that Iran is a strategic area, a regional power with influence 
in the area and that Greek foreign policy is interested in this 
broader region. 
  The foreign minister also noted that he will met with 
Turkish 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin on the sidelines of the NATO 
foreign ministers conference in Istanbul. Responding to a 
journalist's question on whether there has been any Turkish 
reaction to the Patriarchate's demand for greater security and 
what his comment is on this demand, the foreign minister said: 
The demand is certainly justified after the recent terrorist 
attacks against the Patriarchate. You know that the Greek 
Government has reacted strongly in all directions. We also 
protested to the European Union about this situation. I think 
this issue will be one of the main topics of discussion with Mr. 
Cetin. Mr. Papoulias concluded: We certainly have every reason 
to demand this reinforced safety of the Patriarchate.

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said 
that Greece condemns every act of violence and terrorism but it 
does not accept becoming the victim of an orchestrated effort to 
export Turkey's domestic problems to Greece. 
  Venizelos repeated that no office of the PKK [Workers Party 
of Kurdistan] operates in Athens, and once again described the 
Turkish claims as ridiculous, unfounded, and slanderous. 
Venizelos said that President Konstandinos Karamanlis will soon 
give his answer to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel's letter 
and the Turkish claims regarding the PKK action.

  [Text] The KKE [Greek Communist Party] will not vote in 
the Chamber of Deputies for [Prime Minister] Andreas Papandreou 
as president, but will discuss the issue if another candidate is 
presented. 
  Responding to a question on the election of a new president, 
KKE Honorary Chairman Kharilaos Florakis said yesterday in 
Larissa: "Is it in the country's best interest to have 
elections? If a political party believes that it is, it will 
move toward elections regardless of the nominee. However, if a 
political party believes that there is no need for elections 
now, it is the candidate's name that will determine the party's 
stance. If you ask whether we will vote for Papandreou, I 
answer: We will not vote for him. Don't you see his policy? 
How is it different from the policy of New Democracy? The 
basic goals of their policy are the same. Their difference is 
that one was in love with the Germans, and the other in love 
with the Americans."

  [Text] Greece's most subdued preelection period in living 
memory took a bloody twist on Friday [3 June] night, when a man 
concealing a knife in a bouquet of flowers stabbed three Greek 
Communist Party [KKE] candidates for next Sunday's 
Europarliament elections. 
  Right at the end of a party rally in the centre of 
Thessaloniki, the attacker had approached the speakers' stand 
and suddenly pulled out the 12-inch (30 cm) knife. 
  Eurodeputy Vasilios Efraimidhis, Greek General Confederation 
of Labor (YSEE) secretary Ioannis Theonas, and KKE Central 
Committee member Mikhail Spiridhakis were rushed to the nearby 
AHEPA [American-Hellenic Educational and Progressive 
Association] hospital, with deep stab wounds in their hips and 
thighs. 
  The assailant was later identified as Manolis Theodhorakis, 
54, a Greek emigrant worker who had recently returned from 
Germany, and his suspected accomplice, ironsmith Evangelos 
Radhos, 26. Immediately after the attack, outraged supporters 
beat Theodhorakis, who is now in critical condition in the 
hospital. 
  All parties condemned the attack and demanded a full 
investigation, the apparent motive for the brutal attack still 
unknown.

  [Text] Some 57 percent of Greeks do not believe that the 
European Union [EU] operates democratically because of the 
stance of some of our partners on the issue of Skopje [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. This came to 
light because of a public opinion poll, which was released 
today, and caused concern for the EU Commission. Correspondent 
Nikos Bellos has the following report from Brussels: 
  [Begin Bellos recording] The stance maintained by some EU 
members on the issue of Skopje has cause great dissatisfaction 
in Greece. This dissatisfaction in practice translates into a 
significant decrease in the number of Greeks who believe that 
the EU operates democratically. The latest poll conducted in 
the 12 EU member countries last April for the EU Commission was 
made public today and caused concern and anxiety for EU 
officials in Brussels. 
  The Greeks, who up until recently were the warmest 
supporters 
of the EU among European citizens, today appear to be 
particularly reserved and suspicious. Specifically, in a 
statement issued today the EU Commission admitted that the issue 
of Skopje and the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina have negatively 
influenced the Greek public's view toward the EU. 
  According to the poll, 57 percent of Greeks believe that the 
EU does not operate in a democratic way. This represents an 
increase of 22 percent in relation with the last poll in October 
1993. Despite their bitterness, the majority of Greeks still 
believe that the accession to the EU was particularly positive 
for our country. Specifically, 69 percent believe that Greece 
has benefited from its accession to the EU. Furthermore, 64 
percent believe that Greece's participation in the EU is a good 
thing. In comparison with the poll taken last October, there is 
also a decrease in positive answers by 10 and 9 percent 
respectively. 
  Regarding the 12 June elections for the European Parliament, 
the country's domestic political and economic situation will 
play a decisive role in the choice of parties by the voters. 
This was the answer of 85 percent of those asked, whereas only 
11 percent will vote European, that is based on the EU's current 
picture. Finally, the majority of Greeks, 57 percent, are in 
favor of increasing the authority of the European Parliament. 
This is the largest percentage among EU members after Italy.

<F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "A Pipeline of Development"] </F>
  [Text] The promotion of Greek-Russian economic cooperation 
and the convergence of plans by the two governments for alumina, 
natural gas, and primarily Russian oil confirm the extent of 
Greece's possibilities for a more substantive role in the 
Balkans and the further development of its economic relations 
with the Eastern countries. 
  Upon his return from Moscow, Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias said the following about his talks with President 
Boris Yeltsin and the Russian ministers: "In both the political 
and economic sectors, we have achieved what we both -- Greeks 
and Russians -- wanted. That is, we agreed on the big economic 
plans that the two governments are making in such things as 
alumina, gas, and oil." 
  The most important plan, which also has political 
significance, is the plan dealing with the construction of a big 
pipeline for the transfer of Russian oil from Burgas, Bulgaria, 
to the port of Alexandroupolis. 
  This project will make it possible to bypass the Canakkale 
Straits and to address Turkey's threat to ban the passage of 
tankers through the straits. 
  At the same time, the pipeline for the transfer of Russian 
natural gas to Greece as well as the further development of 
economic relations with Russia, Bulgaria, and the other Black 
Sea countries to Alexandroupolis port will acquire international 
importance and become an interesting transit center. 
  All these facts strengthen the possibilities for success of 
the Thrace development program, which would make the region 
Greece's third economic focal point, as was proposed in the 
feasibility study by the Athens Academy's Research Center. 
  Thrace can and must become Greece's third economic focal 
point, it must become an economic and cultural center in the 
Balkans. 
  The government must consider the Athens Academy's proposal 
and utilize it. It would be a mistake to shelve it. 
  The development and improvement of Thrace is a task of 
national significance. The Greek-Russian cooperation projects 
will help in both the development and defense of this sensitive 
border region.

<F P=106> [By Philippe Debeusscher] </F>
  [Excerpts] Geneva, June 7 (AFP) -- Bosnia's warring 
parties remained far apart Tuesday [7 June] on the terms and 
length of a proposed cease-fire as they entered a second day of 
peace talks here, UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi said. 
  Serb forces meanwhile resumed intense shelling of the 
northern Bosnian town of Gradacac and neighboring villages, 
Radio Sarajevo reported. 
  "There are some significant differences which have to be 
bridged," Akashi told AFP just before resuming a series of 
separate talks with Bosnia's Croat and Moslem allies on the one 
hand and Bosnian Serb leaders on the other. 
  Akashi, working alongside UN peacekeeping chiefs General 
Bertrand Lapresle and General Michael Rose, is trying to 
convince both sides to accept a countrywide four-month 
cease-fire proposal put forward by international mediators 
attempting to negotiate a political solution to the conflict. 
  Leaders of the Croat-Moslem federation have demanded only an 
initial four-week cease-fire, with possible extensions being 
conditional on progress in the political talks. 
  In its latest proposals submitted late Monday, the 
federation 
also demanded that any cease-fire be supervised jointly by the 
UN peacekeeping force and NATO and that UN troops be stationed 
not along the front lines but behind them so as to better 
monitor the belligerents -- a demand UN officials said was 
another point of contention. [passage omitted] 
  Before entering Tuesday's talks, Akashi ruled out any UN 
approval of a cease-fire shorter than four months. 
  Asked if he would be prepared to accept the Croat-Moslem 
plan 
for the four-week renewable truce he answered firmly: "No, I am 
not." 
  The Moslem-led Bosnian Government fears that a lengthy 
cease-fire will simply freeze the situation on the ground in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the Serbs control about 70 percent of 
the territory, and encourage the Serbs to stall in the political 
negotiations. 
  Those talks, mediated by the so-called contact group of 
European Union, Russian, UN and U.S. officials, are promoting an 
administrative breakup of Bosnia-Herzegovina which would give 
the Croat-Moslem federation 51 percent of the territory and the 
Serbs 49 percent. 
  Despite the persistent differences, Akashi expressed hope 
that Tuesday's talks would yield a truce accord and said he 
planned to return to his headquarters in Zagreb later in the day. 
  "Our negotiation with both parties separately is proceeding 
exceedingly well. The atmosphere is businesslike, frank and 
friendly." 
  While there were still "a few difficult questions which have 
to be resolved," he said, "we will make every effort possible to 
anchor the agreement by tonight." 
  Although the cease-fire talks were "separate from a 
political 
settlement...of course the two agreements have to be closely 
linked," he added. 
  Akashi first met the Serb delegation led by Radovan Karadzic 
on Tuesday morning for an hour before joining a meeting between 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the joint heads of 
the Bosnian-Croat and Moslem delegation, Kresimir Zubak and Ejup 
Ganic. 
  "Then we will see the Bosnian side and the Serb side and we 
will repeat this throughout the day," Akashi said. 
  The UN envoy said he did not envisage the Bosnian 
delegations 
would sit at the same negotiating table except "for the 
signature" of an agreement.

<F P=106> [Report signed "D.N.": "Clear Majority for Membership?"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- The dramatic final period before the 
European Union [EU] referendum next Sunday [12 June]: From a 
summary of three Ifes [Institute for Empirical Social Research] 
polls that were conducted over the past three weeks, Ifes head 
Ernst Gehmacher reaches the conclusion that there is a clear 
trend among those who are thus far undecided: The majority of 
them will vote for EU membership at the referendum. 
  Yesterday, Monday, at a press conference Gehmacher said: "A 
negative result would be conceivable only if something important 
happens during the final stage" that would produce a protest 
against the government parties or a "profound influx of 
pessimism." As an example, he cited the collapse of a large 
company. 
  The decisive thing is to what extent voters can be mobilized 
during the last days. If the turnout for the EU referendum is 
85 percent, Gehmacher even expects 56 percent to vote for 
membership. Only if the turnout were 60 percent "would the 
result be very narrow." However, the sociologist thinks: "Such 
a low turnout is no longer very likely." 
  According to the results obtained by Ifes, the ratio of 
those 
who are firmly determined to vote for or against EU membership 
is 31:31. However, among those who are still undecided, those 
who sympathize with EU membership are in the majority. This 
trend has developed over the past three weeks. 
  The reason: The entire "establishment," from the church to 
the trade unions, advocates EU membership. "It has been 
possible to produce a climate of opinion that says one should 
vote for EU membership," Gehrmacher said at the press conference. 
  Gehmacher stressed that the attitude toward the EU is 
primarily determined by whether or not economic trends in 
Austria over the next five years is seen positively. A total 
of 58 percent of the optimists are firmly determined to vote for 
membership. In contrast, 61 percent of the pessimists say that 
they will vote against EU membership at the referendum. 
  According to this Ifes classification, those skeptical about 
the future are the largest group of the population -- 52 
percent. A total of 45 percent of them are still uncertain. 
Mobilizing this group would result in a clear increase in yes 
votes, Gehmacher said.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister John Major by </F>
George Jones in London on 7 Jun: "Majority `Back Tory Instincts 
Over Europe'"] 
  [Text] Only 48 hours before the European elections, Mr 
Major was in a bullish mood during an interview yesterday at No 
10. A Gallup poll suggesting that more than half the electors 
are ready to vote Labour tomorrow has stiffened his resolve to 
stand and fight. Interviewed in the No 10 Cabinet room, Mr Major 
made clear he is ready to be more aggressive in convincing the 
public over the Government's "unpopular but right" decisions to 
curb inflation and spoke on policies covering a range of issues. 
<H5>  The EC: `Surveys Reinforce All Our Instincts' </H5>
  Asked to clarify his vision of a "multi-speed Europe", Mr 
Major produced a copy of yesterday's DAILY TELEGRAPH from his 
Ministerial box by his side on the Cabinet table. He pointed to 
a report of the latest Gallup poll headlined: "Britons Remain 
Ambivalent About Europe." 
  Clearly pleased by the results, he said: ``Almost all 
Anthony 
King (author of the report) has written in this morning's paper 
could have been extracts from my speeches. He states: `They 
want the benefits that a Strong European Union can bring but are 
worried that Britain may lose control of its affairs'. 
  ``That has a familiar ring. It is very interesting that the 
instincts we have on Europe are strongly reinforced in attitude 
surveys. 
  ``Most people are not Eurosceptic or Euro-enthusiasts. The 
argument is conducted at these two extremes, but down the middle 
of these extremes is a broad highway of public and political 
opinion that says: we must be part of Europe because it is in 
our economic interests to do so; we must co-operate where it is 
appropriate with our European partners; that co-operation often 
must be by agreement, by consensus and not by direction from 
Brussels. We must look at things in a pragmatic and practical 
way in making decisions on Europe. We should not commit 
ourselves now to things that may or may not happen in a long 
time in the future in circumstances we don't know with partners 
we can't be certain of. That is a very straightforward view of 
Europe that would carry 95 per cent of the population with it.'' 
  Mr Major searched in his box again for the latest Foreign 
Office telegrams; on the Euro-election campaign in Germany for 
proof that he was not alone in Europe in trying to curb the 
centralising tendencies of Brussels. 
  "It is very instructive to look at the election campaign in 
Germany," he said. ``Only the FDP [Free Democratic Party], the 
Liberals, are really Euro-enthusiastic. If you take the CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union], Chancellor Kohl's party, their 
poster is a large German flag superimposed on a less visible 
European flag and the Slogan `For Germany's sake.' 
  ``If I had produced that in this country I would be accused 
of running a nationalist campaign. Nobody accused the Germans 
of running a nationalist campaign. They are not. 
  ``The truth is Germany -- like Britain, France and Spain -- 
has to put its national interest at the heart of their concerns 
in Europe and they do. And that is what we do.'' 
<H5>  The Economy: `We Have Rightly Taken Unpopular Decision' </H5>
  Mr Major was upbeat about improvement in the economy: "You 
are seeing it in production, productivity growth, borrowing 
figures," he said. ``All of those indicate we are on target for 
our growth estimate of 2.5 per cent in the current year. 
  ``That will be getting on for probably twice as high as 
anyone else in the rest of Europe, unless they revise their 
present growth estimates upwards. 
  ``We are not a short-term Government; we are a long-term 
Government. We are unpopular because we have taken unpopular 
decisions that will prove to be right in the long term. 
  ``I sense people are getting bored with personality 
politics, 
trivial politics, and they want a rational, sensible debate on 
the matters that will affect their future. We are taking long 
term decisions. 
  ``Getting inflation down -- that has meant high interest 
rates, but we have got it down to levels that most people cannot 
remember seeing before. We have set an inflation bracket of 
between 1 and 4 per cent that we intend to maintain.'' 
<H5>  Unemployment: `The Sixth Largest Nation in Europe' </H5>
  "We have 20 million people unemployed in Europe. Only one 
country in Europe -- the UK -- has unemployment going down," 
said the Prime Minister. 
  ``The rest have unemployment going up. Unless we are able to 
become more competitive, that trend will continue --22, 24, 25 
million. 
  ``At what point does that stretch the democratic elastic too 
far? At what point do people rebel across Europe? 
  ``The unemployed are the sixth largest nation in the 
European 
Union. We need unemployment going down not up. Those 
politicians who just play to the gallery by asking for extra 
costs on employers will just put unemployment up. 
  ``I believe the responsible thing to do is to try to take 
action to get those people back to work. That is what we are 
doing here. and what the rest of Europe is not doing.'' 
<H5>  Northern Ireland: `More Has Been Done Than People Realise' </H5>
  Mr Major said last week's Chinook helicopter disaster which 
killed 25 of the most senior anti-terrorist figures in Northern 
Ireland, was "a great personal tragedy and a considerable loss 
to the public service." 
  He said others would come forward to do their work against 
terrorism -- "That is in hand already." 
  But he dismissed reports that the tragedy would hasten the 
appointment of a new national security co-ordinator to oversee 
all terrorist investigations on mainland Britain. 
  Mr Major said it was an idea that had been around for a long 
time. "We examined it. There are some very compelling and 
practical arguments against it." 
  "It is not the case that we are planning to introduce a 
brand 
new supremo in this field. It is not going to happen. We have 
decided the balance of argument is against it." 
  He voiced his confidence that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein 
leader, would not be given another visa to visit the United 
States. "I don't believe you will see him back." 
  He believed that people had underestimated the importance of 
the Downing Street declaration on the future of Northern 
Ireland, which had resulted in the IRA becoming increasingly 
isolated. 
  "Areas where they could have expected support in the past 
have drained away from them. We must continue to isolated them, 
put them on the back foot, keep them as an unpalatable aspect of 
life in Northern Ireland and diminish their influence and 
support." 
  He said talks with the constitutional parties had moved 
forward a long way. "Further than most people may imagine. But 
there is still quite a lot to be done. It is a slow, grinding 
business. It involves a huge amount of detail and 
consideration. But more has been done than most people realise." 
<H5>  Drugs: `For Us the Issue Is a Higher Priority' </H5>
  With police chiefs meeting today to discuss their strategy 
against a background of growing demands for cannabis possession 
to be decriminalised, Mr Major said he had decided against that 
though he understood the arguments of its proponents, whom he 
respected. 
  ``But my instincts go in the other direction. I don't 
instinctively favour decriminalisation of soft drugs. I believe 
the best way to tackle drug abuse and trafficking is not to 
legalise drugs but to reduce their demand and to cut off their 
supply. 
  ``The danger I see in legalising drugs is that it will send 
precisely the wrong signals to young people. It would appear to 
make drugs socially acceptable and might be likely to spread 
their use. I can see there are arguments both ways. 
  ``We have to reduce the demand and cut off the supply. The 
drugs issue is a higher priority for us. A lot has been 
happening across Government. But I need it to be more focused.'' 
<H5>  Compensation: `Awards Based on a Very Odd Directive' </H5>
  Asked about some of the recent high compensation awards to 
servicewomen who lost their jobs because of pregnancy, Mr Major 
said: ``It is a very odd and old European directive that is the 
basis of this -- a 1978 directive, accepted by the then Labour 
Government accepting everything put to them, just as the current 
Labour opposition appear to be willing to in the future. 
  ``One or two cases have been highlighted and many people 
think they are very silly. They are rulings by an industrial 
tribunal and are under consideration by the courts.'' 
  "Of the 4,000 valid claims, over 2,000 have been settled at 
around 7,000 pounds a time. A few have produced these out 
landish figures and they are the subject of court consideration 
at the moment. There is nothing more we can say until we have 
the judgment."

<F P=106> [Report by Aslak Bonde: "Government: Withdrawal From EU </F>
Possible"] 
  [Text] In its report on the European Union [EU] to the 
Storting, the government plays down the significance of the 
Maastricht Treaty. The report also states that Norway can 
withdraw from the EU. 
  "It is natural to see the introduction of economic and 
monetary union with a common currency as a further development 
within the framework of the Single Internal Market and the 
gradual convergence of member states' economic policies that 
have been the goals of the EC since the Treaty of Rome was 
adopted in 1957." 
  This quotation from the report to the Storting on EU 
membership is not perhaps so very controversial for most people, 
but it will give rise to reactions. It is an illustration of 
how the government now views the Union treaty. 
  After the treaty came into existence -- at the Maastricht 
summit in December 1991 -- there was general agreement that the 
EC had taken a big step in the direction of integration. 
Economic and monetary union (EMU) was seen as something 
qualitatively different from the existing community. In 
addition there were formulations in the treaty that could pave 
the way for foreign and security policy union. The treaty also 
provided for citizenship of the union and opened the way for 
coordination in the fields of justice and policing. The EC also 
changed its name to the European Union. 
  The government does not view these changes as fundamental. 
In a discussion of the Constitution's paragraph 93 (the 
so-called EU paragraph) reference is made to legal evaluations 
made in 1967, and it is stated that the changes that have 
happened since then are not so great as to indicate that new 
conclusions should be reached. 
  This could be of great significance. If it happens at some 
point in the future that the Storting has to decide whether the 
krone is to be replaced by a common EU currency, it will not 
necessarily have to do so with a three-quarters majority. Trade 
Minister Grete Knudsen confirmed this at Friday's [3 June] news 
conference on the EU report. 
  On the other hand the further development of cooperation in 
the justice sector or in the foreign and security policy area 
will need a three-quarters majority in the Storting. 
  An important point in the report to the Storting is that the 
Maastricht Treaty's stipulations in these areas only have the 
status of international law. Norwegian membership now will not 
give the various EU bodies any direct authority over Norwegian 
citizens or companies in the field of justice or in the security 
field. 
  We are not relinquishing any sovereignty in the traditional 
sense of the word. 
  The government is also discussing what will happen if 
conflicts arise between EC law and Norwegian law. Initially 
membership means that EC law takes precedence -- particularly in 
the economic field. 
  The Storting report states that it is a Norwegian court that 
will have the job of reaching a judgment if there is a conflict 
between the EU's rules and Norwegian legislation. The 
government does not think that such conflicts will arise. If 
they do, the report asserts that the EU Court has little scope 
for action. It could declare that the Norwegian legislation 
conflicts with EC law, but it cannot declare decisions made by 
national authorities to be invalid. 
  Both the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht Treaty state that 
they are valid for an unlimited period of time, and they contain 
no rules covering withdrawal from them. This has led many EU 
opponents and lawyers to claim that Norway's decision this fall 
is irrevocable. 
  The government makes use of legal and political 
counterarguments. 
  In the legal context the government refers to the Vienna 
Convention on treaty law and concludes that the EU treaties are 
of a type that can be terminated. It also points out that 
Greenland actually withdrew from the EC and that Britain had a 
referendum in 1975 in which the question asked was about a 
possible withdrawal. 
  "A `no' would naturally have led to withdrawal," the report 
argues. 
  However, this presupposes that Norway and the EU negotiate 
the terms of a withdrawal, if this were to happen.

<F P=106> [Interview with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Kai </F>
Diekmann; place and date not given: "Mr. Kohl, How Important Is 
Friendship in Politics?"] 
  [Text] [Diekmann] Mr. Kohl, how important is friendship 
in world politics? 
  [Kohl] It would be a mistake to expect personal friendships 
to remedy real political problems. 
  But, if the chemistry is right, if you get on with each 
other 
right away, if you have walked a common path, and if a personal 
relationship has developed, everything gets much easier. Then 
you can say: "Listen, there is no way I will do that. I could 
not make my people at home understand that." 
  [Diekmann] Who among the heads of state do you count as your 
friends? 
  [Kohl] Francois Mitterrand of course, and certainly Felipe 
Gonzalez; also Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton. But there is a 
number of others as well. 
  [Diekmann] How did French President Mitterrand become your 
friend? 
  [Kohl] What is important in our relationship is that, like 
me, Francois Mitterrand tends to break through the rigid 
framework of protocol. When I am in Paris and the official part 
is over, we sometimes get away, go for a meal together. To 
ordinary places, restaurants where students go. 
  We talk to each other on the phone frequently, even if it is 
not about politics. I will never forget how he immediately 
called me at the hospital when my son Peter had a serious 
accident. They called me out of the intensive care unit, 
because Francois Mitterrand was on the phone next door, 
comforting me. 
  [Diekmann] What was it like with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, who is a whole generation younger than you? 
  [Kohl] The ice was broken during our first meeting. I 
simply told him: Before talking about politics we should talk a 
little about ourselves, who we are, what our family backgrounds 
are. He told me about his parents, I told him about mine. 
  My father worked for the inland revenue, we were not 
wealthy. 
I paid for most of my university education myself. With Bill 
Clinton things were very similar. 
  We obviously got along, for, as the official talks ended he 
went for his mother. And the three of us sat together talking 
for a long time. 
  In my experience, the relationships with their wives, but 
also with their mothers, are among the most important things in 
men's lives. 
  [Diekmann] What was your reaction when Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin first suggested that you go to the sauna together? 
  [Kohl] We found out on an earlier occasion that we both like 
going to the sauna. When I was in Moscow last time I did not 
have much time, I was only passing through. No way did I want 
to go to the sauna. It was a very, very chilly evening, we met 
at a chalet near the airport. Boris Yeltsin was already there 
saying: "Let us go to the sauna right away." 
  I replied: "Just a moment, I am not at all in the mood for 
that." 
  But he was determined to go. So we went to the sauna, went 
swimming, and talked about all our affairs. 
  [Diekmann] Boris Yeltsin also visited you at your home at 
Oggersheim.... 
  [Kohl] In private life it is quite normal to invite 
colleagues, who are also friends, to your home. In world 
politics it is the greatest gesture you can make. Boris Yeltsin 
enjoyed very much seeing what my home country, my home, is like. 
  Boris Yeltsin and I have a very friendly relationship. He is 
a very sensitive man. The great big frame must not blind you to 
that. He has a distinct feeling for moods. 
  There is another thing, which also goes for Bill Clinton, 
Boris Yeltsin, and Francois Mitterrand: We all like our food, 
myself maybe most. 
  [Diekmann] Do you sometimes phone up Yeltsin and Clinton 
even if you do not have any important business to discuss? 
  [Kohl] Yes. It is the same as in private life: When I see 
that the other person has problems I call them and say: I just 
wanted to tell you, keep your chin up, I will keep my fingers 
crossed.... 
  My mother always told us: When people are doing fine you 
need not go and see them, because then everyone is going there. 
But it is when they are having problems that you need to go.

  [Text] Bill Clinton spent an extra hour at the prime 
minister's office with Edouard Balladur. The U.S. President 
talked about the major current issues, such as GATT, the G-7, 
Bosnia, and Europe. 
  Clinton and Balladur also talked with journalists for a 
while. The French prime minister seized this opportunity to say 
how much he appreciated U.S. security policy in Europe: 
  [Begin Balladur recording] I still have confidence in the 
U.S. Administration and in the actions of President Clinton. We 
may not hold the same views on some issues -- the opposite would 
be surprising -- but what is of the utmost importance is our 
common desire to maintain peace and security in Europe. 
  I must say that I found President Clinton to be very 
open-minded with regard to European issues and the need for 
Europe to be better organized. This is what he repeated earlier 
as we were finishing our lunch. 
  I think that most of the reasons why we may have 
misunderstood each other have now disappeared. [end recording]

Bambino Gesu hospital where 11 Rwandan children have been 
admitted. When asked about the possible solutions to the Rwandan 
tragedy, Berlusconi said: 
  [Begin Berlusconi recording] I believe that if we have a 
true 
conscience as world citizens, then I believe we must find a way 
to intervene. We must find a way to intervene adequately, 
quickly, in an effective way; I believe that the world, those 
countries that are democratic and civilized, must find a way of 
setting up an army, a permanent task force for exactly this type 
of intervention. This task force could be made up perhaps of 
ordinary troops or volunteers. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Burak Bekdil] </F>
  [Text] Moldova -- President Suleyman Demirel said Thursday 
[2 June] that the path that has been followed on the Cyprus 
issue has been ineffective and a new one should be found. 
  Demirel gave information about his trip to Ukraine and 
Moldova and he expressed his views on foreign policy issues in 
his news conference in Kishinev. 
  Demirel rejected the claims that the Cyprus issue was in a 
deadlock, saying there would be a reasonable solution. "What is 
the deadlock in Cyprus? Is there a Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus (TRNC)? Has it a flag? It has. What will be done with 
Ghali's report? Will this situation disappear? The flag and 
soil are wanted from you. We gave neither. What is being 
sought after? A federation with two societies. Will the 
dispute be solved if you bring together two different nations in 
the same crucible?" Demirel concluded. 
  He pointed out that the Western countries recognized the 
Greek Cypriot administration as being the whole of Cyprus and 
stressed that this was unjust and wrong. One hundred fifty 
thousand people have been isolated on an island in the 
Mediterranean, Demirel said. "This is against humanity. Several 
countries act as if Turkey invaded the island. Turkey had the 
responsibility to protect the peace and did it. If it had not 
done so, would it be better? The United Nations work has had no 
result. Both soil and flag are wanted. You cannot offer such a 
solution to anybody. It is possible to find a reasonable 
solution which will be accepted by the Turkish people and the 
TRNC." 
  Demirel pointed out that Turkey was one of the very first 
countries to recognize Ukraine and Moldova's independence. 
"Now, we are looking for cooperation with them," he said. 
Demirel disclosed that the situation of the Gagauz Turks and 
Tartars had been discussed during his visit. The Crimean 
Tartars and Gagauz have to be given more importance on Turkey's 
agenda, he said. 
  Demirel characterized the treatment of the Tartars as a 
shame 
for humanity and said their resettlement on their land was of 
concern to Turkey. 
  Ottomans and Tartars were together in all victories, Demirel 
said. "Nobody should take this as an offense. This is our 
humanitarian department. Nobody should be uneasy about our 
cooperation with Moldova and Ukraine. Our relations with Russia 
are good. Our bilateral relations will not create hostility 
with a third country. Our goal is to make the Black Sea a sea 
of peace." 
  Demirel also announced that Turkey would build residences in 
Crimea for Tartars with the $100 million credit from the Europe 
Reconstruction Fund. 
  He pointed out that Turkey was helping Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
northern Iraq and Azerbaijan and Moldova and Ukraine should be 
added to this list. "This is the concept. Turkey has to be 
interested if it is to be an important state. Turkey has a 
historical responsibility. These problems are all the heritage 
of our past. We cannot say (who cares about the Ottomans). 
These people speak fluent Turkish. They preserved their 
traditions. Turkey has to show interest in Turks who are living 
outside of Turkey," he concluded. 
  While responding to a question, Demirel disclosed that 
Turkey 
was implementing a policy of friendship. "This visit has caused 
repercussions in the foreign press. Turkey is implementing an 
independent and free foreign policy and it is Turkey's right," 
Demirel stressed. 
  He also said that there was instability in northern Iraq. 
Stressing the importance of Iraq's territorial integrity, 
Demirel said. "If Iraq disintegrates, the problem in the Middle 
East will not end in 450 years." 
  In answering a journalist's question, he said that a 3,500 
strong tribe that had been cooperating with the PKK (outlawed 
Kurdish Workers' Party) had gone to northern Iraq. They went 
after the security forces' successful operations against the 
separatist organization, and the security forces did not open 
fire on them. Demirel said: "They had a guilt complex. They are 
obeying the PKK's orders. They have camps over there. They 
(the PKK) are trying to create a civilian belt around them." 
<H5>  Russia Is Not a Threat </H5>
  Moreover, Demirel said that he would not accept that Russia 
is a threat to Turkey. 
  Demirel received Stepan Topal, the leader of the Gagauz 
Turks, his deputy Peter Buzaci and Parliament Speaker Mikail 
Kendigelen on Friday. After the reception, Demirel 
participated in the ceremony of the opening of the Turkish 
Embassy's temporary building in Kishinev with his Moldovan 
counterpart Mircea Snegur. The two leaders held a joint news 
conference after they signed eight accords in various fields. 
  During a news conference a journalist asked Demirel if 
Russia 
was a subject of threat or cooperation. Demirel disclosed that 
the talks with Moldova were aimed to serve peace and welfare in 
the region. "The two countries are not preparing a plan or 
threat to a third country. Escalation of cooperation between 
countries is an advantage to everybody. Russia is our neighbor. 
I have signed the agreement of friendship and cooperation with 
Yeltsin. There is no relation between the accords that we 
signed today and Russia and threat," Demirel noted. 
  Snegur said he agreed with Demirel on this subject and noted 
that the talks would escalate the cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  Demirel also disclosed that Turkey would provide $35 million 
worth of credit to Moldova to develop the southern part of the 
country, which is mainly inhabited by Gagauz Turks. Turkey and 
Moldova signed accords of friendship and cooperation, land 
transportation, civil aviation, agriculture, culture, to 
struggle against international drug trafficking, terrorism and 
to struggle against organized crime.

<F P=106> [Irfan Sapmaz report: "Russia Active in the Caucasus Again"] </F>
  [Text] Baku -- Russia has moved again to direct diplomatic 
pressure on Azerbaijan to force it to agree to the plan it has 
drawn up for peace in Daghlyk Karabakh. Vladimir Kazimirov, 
President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy, arrived in Baku and 
held talks with President Geydar Aliyev the day before 
yesterday. It has been reported that Aliyev and Kazimirov 
argued rigorously in their six-hour talks in camera. It has 
also been reported that no calls were transferred to their 
meeting. 
  Several sources have said that Vladimir Kazimirov adopted a 
hard line approach and outlined Russia's determination to deploy 
troops in Daghlyk Karabakh, noting that Moscow will do whatever 
is necessary to achieve its objective. However, they quoted 
President Aliyev reacting to Kazimirov as follows: "Russia 
cannot deploy its troops in Azerbaijan by itself. They will 
have to tread over my dead body first. Russia's troops can be 
deployed within the framework of an international force, which 
the CSCE will establish." 
  Kazimirov shuttled between the presidential palace and the 
parliament yesterday. He held talks with Speaker of the 
National Assembly Resul Guliyev and Foreign Minister Gasan 
Gasanov for five hours. It has been reported that heated 
exchanges took place in that meeting. Guliyev and Kazimirov 
were received by Aliyev in the evening. 
  Kazimirov has had intensive talks in Baku during the past 
three days. However, the reluctance of the officials to make a 
disclosure and the measures they have taken to avoid the 
correspondents have drawn attention. In view of that, the 
correspondents have been unable to establish the changes 
Kazimirov may have proposed in Russia's peace plan on Karabakh. 
The latest reports said that Azerbaijan objected to Russia 
deploying its troops in Daghlyk Karabakh by itself and insisted 
that an international force be deployed in that region. 
  It has been reported that Kazimirov will travel from Baku to 
Yerevan to hold talks with the Armenian officials. He will then 
return to Azerbaijan.

Warren Christopher and Japanese Government representative Nobuo 
Matsunaga on Wednesday [8 June] agreed that the two nations

issue, Japanese officials said. 
  The agreement came as they held talks at the Organization

Paris. They were attending the two-day OECD ministerial meeting. 
  Christopher expressed strong concern over the situation in 
North Korea. Matsunaga, former ambassador to the United States, 
said the Japanese Government will in principle take concerted 
action if the United States imposes economic sanctions on North 
Korea, the officials said. 
  However, Matsunaga stressed the necessity to maintain 
further 
efforts for a peaceful settlement of the issue, they added.

  [Text] Vienna, June 8 (AFP) -- Almost all fuel rods have 
been removed from the core of the experimental reactor believed 
by western experts to be feeding a covert North Korean nuclear 
arms programme, the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] 
said here Wednesday [8 June]. 
  Discharging of the five megawatt reactor had now been 90 
percent completed, said a spokesman for the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. 
  Pyongyang has repeatedly refused to allow IAEA inspectors 
access to the reactor and one other nuclear site where the 
Agency suspects solid and liquid nuclear waste from a military 
nuclear programme are stocked. 
  IAEA Director General Hans Blix told the UN Security Council 
last week that 70 percent of the fuel rods from the experimental 
reactor had been removed, and that the organisation was no 
longer in a position to prove whether North Korea was building 
bombs. 
  Blix said the IAEA knows "undeclared plutonium" exists in 
North Korea but does not know if it amounts to grammes (ounces) 
or kilogrammes (pounds). At least eight kilos (17.6 pounds) of 
plutonium are needed to build a nuclear weapon. 
  The IAEA board of governors is due to meet behind closed 
doors here Thursday, with the Pyongyang nuclear crisis likely to 
head the agenda, an IAEA spokesman said earlier Wednesday. 
  On Tuesday North Korea repeated its categoric refusal to 
allow access to its two sites.

  [Text] Paris, June 8 KYODO -- In the communique, the OECD 
ministers described the December signing of the Uruguay Round 
world trade accords and the planned creation of the WTO as 
"historic events which mark an important step toward a universal 
trading system." 
  The ministers then clarified their commitment to "do 
everything" to ensure the round's accords will be ratified so 
that the WTO can take effect on Jan. 1 next year. 
  The ministers also agreed the OECD will "resist 
protectionism 
in all its forms and continue to work toward further trade 
liberalization, proper functioning of market mechanisms and 
deregulation." 
  The communique underscored the importance for the OECD to 
continue to build up "contact, dialogue and cooperation" with 
nonmember countries, which it says are "gaining relevance in the 
world economy and are basing their development on market 
principles, pluralist democracy and respect for human rights, as 
the OECD countries have long done." 
  Specifically, the communique said the OECD will pursue 
policy 
coordination with China by exploring "possibilities for dialogue 
and cooperation...where mutual interests exist." 
  The communique supported South Korea's bid to join the OECD 
club in 1996. 
  "(South) Korea has established further close links with the 
OECD and is now taking part in a number of activities on the 
same footing as member countries," the ministers said, noting 
Seoul plans to file a formal application for membership by the 
end of the year. 
  The OECD ministers also called for further dialogue with 
other Asian countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, former 
communist bloc countries and Latin American nations. 
  This year's OECD ministerial meeting was divided into three 
major topics -- "promoting growth and employment," 
"strengthening the multilateral system" and "the role of the 
OECD in an evolving world." 
  Proposals under the first topic were unveiled on the first 
day of the ministerial conference. The unusual advance release 
of part of the communique reflects the growing sense of crisis 
within the OECD about the world jobless issue. 
  As prescriptions for the unemployment problem, in which 35 
million people are out of work within the OECD group, OECD 
Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye issued a special statement 
Tuesday [7 June] appealing to OECD member countries to formulate 
action programs to rectify structural problems that hamper job 
creation in the world. 
  In order to spur global creation of jobs, Japan and Europe 
were indirectly requested under the communique to quicken their 
economic recoveries through further fiscal and monetary steps. 
  "Where recovery is not yet sustained, eased monetary policy 
should be maintained...where possible, consistent with the 
medium-term policy objective of budget consolidation, fiscal 
measures will be implemented as necessary to ensure sustained 
noninflationary growth led by strong domestic demand," the 
communique said. 
  After the closing of the ministerial meeting, the 33rd of 
its 
kind since 1973, the Paris-based think tank signed a cooperation 
pact with Russia aimed at smoothing its shift to a market 
economy for the country's eventual integration into the world 
economy. 
  During the signing ceremony, the OECD ministers and Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev confirmed mutual cooperation in 
crafting a market-oriented reform program that focuses on 
establishing a legal, institutional and statistical framework in 
Russia. 
  The pact calls for an annual review of implementation of 
reform measures proposed. 
  The joint communique warned against the use of unilateral 
retaliation-oriented measures as a tool for settling bilateral 
trade disputes. 
  "Any trade-restrictive or distortive measures that would 
contradict" the Uruguay Round trade accords should be avoided, 
the communique said in an apparent reference to the recent U.S. 
move to resort to retaliatory steps like the Super 301 trade 
clause. 
  Nobuo Matsunaga, Japanese Government representative for 
external affairs, told Tuesday's ministerial session that 
unilateral measures run the risk of eroding the multilateral 
trade system. 
  The communique called for any country in trade wrangling to 
use dispute settlement procedures under the WTO, which will have 
more enforcing power than GATT. 
  The ministers agreed to promote "effective observance" of 
recommended measures intended to curb bribery in international 
business transactions. 
  The measures are targeted at schemes by individuals and 
corporations to bribe public servants in other nations to smooth 
their business. 
  The ministers also agreed to extend its anti-money 
laundering 
program for an additional five years.

  [Text] Paris, June 8 KYODO -- Following are the highlights 
of a communique adopted at a ministerial meeting of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
Wednesday [8 June]: 
<H5>  Promoting Growth and Employment </H5>

  -  Where the economic 
recovery is not yet sustained, eased monetary policy should be 
maintained or the scope for further easing should be exploited 
as far as possible. Where possible, fiscal measures will be 
implemented as necessary to ensure sustained noninflationary 
growth led by strong domestic demand. 

<H5>  Strengthening the Multilateral System </H5>

  -  Member countries 
undertake to do everything to ensure the new World Trade 
Organization (WTO) will enter into force on the targeted date of 
Jan. 1, 1995. 
  -  Member countries undertake to avoid any 
trade-restrictive or destructive measures that would contradict 
the letter or spirit of the new rules and disciplines under the 
WTO, and to conform to multilateral dispute settlement 
procedures. 
  -  The OECD will actively support the preparatory 
committee and the WTO in implementing the Uruguay Round 
agreements and their work programs. 
  -  Members undertake to resist 
protectionism in all its forms and continue to work toward 
further trade liberalization, proper functioning of market 
mechanisms and deregulation.

  [Excerpt] The spring meetings of the NATO Foreign 
Ministers Council has started in Istanbul. 
  The opening session was held this morning. The foreign 
ministers of the 16 member countries are participating. At the 
opening session, speeches were delivered by Foreign Minister 
Hikmet Cetin, honorary chairman British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd, and acting NATO Secretary General Sergio Valencino. 
  The first speech was delivered by Cetin who said that under 
the changing world conditions, like other international 
organizations, NATO saw itself insufficient. He pointed out 
that difficulties are being faced at times in positing the will 
that can bring about any changes. Within this framework, he 
said, the decisions reached during the NATO summit held in 
January were very appropriate. 
  Assessing NATO's functions so far, Cetin stated that the 
alliance must be able to meet the needs of the political and 
strategic conditions in Europe. He stressed that first and 
foremost NATO must have credibility. I consider the alliance as 
a basic vehicle in establishing European stability, he said, 
adding that NATO should be able to play a more effective role in 
areas where stability has been upset. 
  Cetin said: The developments of the past few years should 
teach us some lessons. One of them is that even though we are 
on the eve of the 21st century, certain communities do not 
refrain from resorting to barbaric methods to further their own 
interests. In such situations where all the values and 
principles we uphold are violated, it is impossible for the 
alliance to avert its eyes and hope that the conflict will go 
away. 
  Foreign Minister Cetin stressed that when it has to act, 
NATO 
must do so in a timely fashion and with determination. That is 
the only way to prevent barbarism in crisis areas, he said. 
  Cetin pointed out that the success of the alliance should be 
ignored, adding that its determined approach in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina prevented the conflict from spreading further 
and contributed to peace. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel (Free Democratic Party) has rejected Russian ideas for a 
European security system. Subordinating NATO to the Conference 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), as Russia has in 
mind, "would run counter to our security interests and is not 
acceptable," Kinkel said today at the NATO foreign ministers' 
spring conference in Istanbul. NATO remained the anchor for 
security and stability in Europe, the advance release of 
Kinkel's speech said. It is important for Russia to take an 
active part in the Partnership for Peace. Over and above that, 
relations should be deepened, Kinkel stressed, calling for the 
meeting to give a signal to that effect to Moscow. However, 
this "by no means meant a directorate of NATO and Russia for 
European security questions." Nor can Russia "receive any kind 
of right of veto over alliance decisions."

<F P=106> [Interview with Egon Klepsch, speaker of the European </F>
Parliament, by Jacques Docquiert; place and date not given: 
"Egon Klepsch: `Codecisionmaking Powers of Parliament Must Be 
Expanded'" -- first two paragraphs are LES ECHOS introduction] 
  [Text] Since 1 January 1992, Egon Klepsch has been speaker 
of the European Parliament. This influential member of the 
German CDU [Christian Democratic Union], 64 years of age, is 
very familiar with this institution because he has held a seat 
in it since 1973, and from 1984 to 1992 he chaired one of its 
most influential political groups: the European Peoples' Party. 
So he is one of the authors of Parliament's increasing powers, 
something which Germany in particular has wanted. 
  In his opinion, the only body of the European Union [EU] 
which "meets and makes decisions publicly" should be given more 
powers, in particular "codecisionmaking powers for all 
legislative activities which are decided by the Council by a 
majority vote." His successor will also have to guarantee "the 
full implementation of the Maastricht Treaty" and "the 
deepening" of the EU through future enlargement. Therefore, the 
EU Parliament will have to "participate appropriately in the 
preparations for the intergovernmental conference in 1996." 
  [Docquiert] What is the main lesson you have learned from 
the 
legislative session just ended? 
  [Klepsch] Since the third direct election of June 1989, the 
European Parliament has increased its importance, influence, 
powers, and prestige considerably. It has made a decisive 
contribution to the economic and political progress of the last 
few years. It participated in the implementation and entry into 
force of the Maastricht Treaty, the European Economic Area, and 
a number of agreements with third countries. It has managed to 
strengthen its role as a democratic supervisory body defending 
the interests of the people. Outside the Union, the European 
Parliament is considered a model for democratic development. 
  [Docquiert] What strengths and weaknesses of the European 
Parliament have been highlighted? 
  [Klepsch] One of the strengths of the Parliament lies in the 
fact that it has continually managed to find compromise 
solutions across national borders and the boundaries of the 
political parties. Moving beyond national interests and 
barriers, a European way of looking at things has taken root. 
In some cases, however, the contradictions proved too great, in 
particular with respect to the Commission's white paper on 
economic growth and employment, on which it was impossible to 
define a uniform position. This is undeniably one low-point of 
the legislative session which has just ended. 
  [Docquiert] Do you feel that, because of Parliament's 
debates 
and work, the commitments made in Maastricht are beginning to 
take concrete form? 
  [Klepsch] Even before the entry into force of the Maastricht 
Treaty, the European Parliament had finished the preparations 
needed to implement it. Several interinstitutional agreements 
have entered into force since late October 1993. Since then, a 
number of reconciliation procedures with the Council of 
Ministers have been successfully concluded. The Parliament 
stressed its point of view several times, especially during the 
procedure for adopting the new multiannual research program. 
The newly elected Parliament will shortly make use of its new 
right to ratify the nomination of the president of the 
Commission and the entire composition of the Commission. Thus, 
the practical implementation of the provisions of the Maastricht 
Treaty is continuing without a break. 
  [Docquiert] The Treaty on European Union grants new powers 
to 
the Parliament. How do you see its role in the future vis-a-vis 
the Council and the Commission? 
  [Klepsch] The European Parliament, which is the European 
Union's only directly elected institution, is also the only body 
which meets and makes decisions publicly. The Council and 
Commission work behind closed doors. It is important to make 
the activities and decisions of these two bodies more 
transparent. We must make Europe more understandable to the 
people. The European Parliament must broaden the 
codecisionmaking powers that it currently enjoys in the internal 
market and the key sectors to include all legislative activities 
which are approved by the Council with a majority vote. 
  In addition, the Parliament demands full budget powers, 
i.e., 
powers which cover obligatory spending as well as "receipts." 
Moreover, it demands the right to approve amendments to the 
Treaty. Only under these conditions will the European Parliament 
be able to fully assume its role in the democratic debate and in 
the cooperative efforts with the Council and Commission. 
  [Docquiert] What must the priorities of your successor be? 
  [Klepsch] My successor, whether a man or a woman, should 
make 
it a priority to go after the full implementation of the 
provisions set out in the Maastricht Treaty. The comprehensive 
institutional reform and the parallel implementation of 
enlargement and deepening demanded by the European Parliament 
are still current issues. It is important that the European 
Parliament participate appropriately in the preparations for the 
intergovernmental conference to be held in 1996. The new 
Parliament and its 567 deputies representing 346 million EU 
citizens must make the most of this occasion to successfully 
push through other legitimate demands.

<F P=106> [Interview with European Competition Commissioner Karel Van </F>
Miert by Willy Biesemans; place and date not given: "GAZET VAN 
ANTWERPEN Readers Meet European Commissioner Karel Van Miert -- 
`We Need More Europe'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Excessive Labor Costs </H5>
  In his address, Van Miert points out that the economic 
crisis 
is reaching further than was expected. He urges to join all 
forces to combat the crisis and believes that the implementation 
of the Maastricht Treaty should be subordinate to fighting to 
crisis and unemployment. 
  [Van Miert] We must recognize that the present crisis is not 
just cyclical and that there are also structural weaknesses. 
For example there is not enough investment to get the engine of 
the economy working again. We cannot reduce unemployment 
without normal economic growth. With growth of 2.5 percent, we 
are only able to stabilize unemployment. Growth must be higher 
if we are to force it down. 
  We must look for other ways and in the meantime we have 
realized that it will become more difficult for a number of 
categories of people to find jobs. I am thinking of workers 
with little or no qualification. The cost of labor is far too 
high. I am not saying that people earn too much, but that the 
social charge is pushing wage costs up. And then right away you 
reach the problem of financing social security. This financing 
is a real problem, at least if you do not want to throw the 
basic principles of the system overboard. And neither I nor the 
Commission are prepared to repudiate these principles. Let us 
be honest: Even if we get some economic growth in the coming 
months, the unemployment problem will still not be solved. 
  All these problems are linked to one another. To solve them, 
European cooperation is necessary. Only "more Europe" offers a 
way out. Of course I can see that other trends are raising 
their head and calling for withdrawal into national approaches, 
in the false hope or false expectation that things will go 
better then. And note that I am saying a false hope or false 
expectation. 
  [Biesemans] But this position says nothing about the 
tendency 
of European companies to move and produce in areas where wage 
costs are lower and social protection represents virtually 
nothing. Aren't agreements in this field necessary? 
  [Van Miert] The European Union is indeed not an island and 
the problem of delocalization cannot be denied. We must 
certainly strive for rules which apply throughout the world. 
The recent GATT agreement on freer world trade does not solve 
everything. It is incomplete. We must strive to add social 
clauses and minimum agreements on environmental protection to 
international treaties. The fact that a number of developing 
countries or China are able to produce so cheaply is in part 
related to child labor or the forced employment of prisoners, 
while environmental standards are scarcely respected, if at all. 
Europe must work closely with the United States to push through 
such agreements. I believe that there is a common interest.

  [Text] Brussels, June 8 (AFP) -- The European Union's [EU] 
executive Commission Wednesday [8 June] urged the 12 member 
states to adopt a concerted strategy to fight drug trafficking 
and drug addiction. 
  The EU commissioner in charge of justice and internal 
affairs, Padraig Flynn, said "drug addiction and trafficking 
present a major threat for Europe's citizens." He said the 
problems called for a "coordinated reaction by the Union and its 
member states." 
  The action plan presented by Flynn suggests better use could 
be made of the Netherlands-based Europol to achieve police, 
customs and legal cooperation to fight drug trafficking. 
  The plan also suggests greater cooperation with third 
countries either in the framework of existing international 
agreements or by negotiating specific agreements.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Focus on Austria's Security'"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Four days before the European Union [EU] 
referendum a series of statements on the various aspects of EU 
accession was made on Wednesday [8 June]. Federal President 
Thomas Klestil, Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak, and Defense 
Minister Werner Fasslabend concentrated on security. 
  At an information rally "Youth for Europe" in Vienna, 
Klestil 
emphasized that as far as the EU entry is concerned the main 
focus would be Austria's security. He pointed out that the 
Germans and French alone engaged in 27 battles against each 
other, "while today war between the two great European peoples 
had become unthinkable." Klestil also argued that, as a small 
country, Austria was unable to deal with such new threats such 
as mass immigration, organized crime, or risks related to 
nuclear power, by itself. 
  Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak said that Austria's 
accession to the EU will increase the security of our country. 
After EU entry, the judicial authorities would be able to 
directly cooperate in the sphere of criminal investigations to 
fight organized crime. According to Loeschnak, Austria can also 
expect support from the EU on immigration policy: "After all, 
it is indeed hard to understand that one and the same person 
should file applications for asylum in several states, while the 
various states shift the burden of illegal immigration to one 
another instead of joining forces and seeking solutions 
together." Moreover, Austria, which has made the greatest 
contribution to the temporary accommodation of Bosnian war 
refugees, can expect at least some easing of the situation from 
fair, European-wide burden sharing. 
  Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend expects EU membership to 
enhance security. Many Austrians underestimate the danger of 
possible crisis spots in the region. For Fasslabend it is clear 
that an attack against an EU member state is less likely than 
one against a state outside the European system. 
  A "no" in next Sunday's EU referendum would not mean the 
rejection of something new but rather a departure from Austria's 
present course, Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek said. Austria's EU 
accession is the logical consequence of its current cooperation 
with the west European states, with which one must react to the 
political changes in Europe and economic developments. Busek 
also stressed that all over countries are joining together in 
regional blocs, as the United States and Mexico have done. 
Austria must not remain alone in these developments. We have 
to provide for security in our country. "In the cold war" 
Austria "benefited from its situation" and was well protected, 
"but now one must not expect other states to fight for us only 
because we are so nice or because of our Lipizzaner stallions." 
The vice chancellor is convinced that within the EU our country 
would be protected by the other states, while the EU would 
hardly fight as actively for third countries. 
  Transport Minister Viktor Klima pointed out that even within 
the EU there would be enough room for Austria to pursue a 
transportation policy of its own. Austria should continue to 
play the pioneering role it has played so far in this sphere 
even once it is a EU member, and not pursue a narrow-minded, 
isolationist policy. 
  On Wednesday, the three presidents of the Nationalrat, Heinz 
Fischer, Robert Lichal, and Heide Schmidt repeated their appeal 
to the electorate to turn out in as large numbers as possible 
for the 12 June referendum. The poll is one of the most 
important decisions in the Second Republic, and every citizen 
should participate in it after fairly weighing all arguments in 
favor against those against membership; Sunday's vote should 
neither be a decision on the government nor on the opposition 
but a vote on Austria's future. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Call for High Voter Turnout"] </F>
  [Text] Five days before the referendum on Austria's 
accession to the European Union [EU], a number of leading Social 
Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] and Austrian People's Party 
[OeVP] officials issued appeals. Among others, Federal 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Vienna Mayor Helmut Zilk, and 
Economics Federation President Leopold Maderthaner, and Johann 
Hoechtl, chairman of the OeVP's Workers' and Employees' 
Association [OeAAB], appealed to all Austrians to participate in 
the referendum this coming Sunday [12 June] and to vote with yes. 
  Vranitzky asked the EU supporters, in particular, to 
exercise 
their right to vote. Of course, all citizens should make use of 
their democratic right to vote. Asked about the result of the 
referendum, Vranitzky said that he did not expect an 
overwhelming decision. The result will be clear and 
unambiguous, albeit not overwhelming, the chancellor said. 
  Economics Federation President Leopold Maderthaner and OeAAB 
Chairman Josef Hoechtl said that a clear majority was in favor 
of EU entry. Yet, the question was whether all these people 
would cast their vote on 12 June. For Maderthaner the question 
is whether, as of 1995, Austria would belong to West Europe or, 
together with Switzerland, to the group of states of the former 
East bloc and the former Yugoslavia. 
  Both officials strongly warned against the threatening loss 
of jobs as a result of a negative referendum result. A total of 
100,000 jobs were at stake, Hoechtl said: 43,000 new ones by the 
end of the century in the case of a positive outcome, or the 
loss of 60,000 in the case of a no. As a result of the 
rejection of the European Economic Area [EEA] 18 months ago, 
150,000 jobs were lost in Switzerland. 
  Only EU membership can safeguard Austria as a financial 
center, Maderthaner emphasized. In the case of a no, a dramatic 
slump in investment would have to be feared similarly to 
Switzerland, where investment has fallen to a minimum since the 
no to the EEA. Maderthaner emphasized that a no in the EU 
referendum would also threaten Austria's function as a bridge 
to--and center for--the states of the former East bloc. 
  On the occasion of the 45th-anniversary celebration of the 
Lawyers' Association, Justice Minister Nikolaus Michalek 
welcomed the fact that the legal aid associations had taken a 
clear public position and, after a critical examination, said 
"yes" to EU entry. 
  A study on "European integration under ecological and social 
criteria" was presented by the Greens on Tuesday. The study, 
which was sponsored by the Greens' think tank and carried out by 
the Advisory Council for Economic, Social and Environmental 
Alternatives, describes the alternative to the Maastricht Treaty 
in terms of economic and monetary policy. The authors 
emphasized that the study does not present a clear stand for or 
against Austrian EU entry. Madeleine Petrovic, chairwoman of 
the Greens caucus in the Austrian Parliament, emphasized that 
the question of yes or no on 12 June was beyond the scope of 
the study but that one could conclude the necessity for change. 
Johannes Voggenhuber, Greens spokesman for European affairs, 
emphasized that the Greens doesn't intend to teach the 
government a lesson on the day of the referendum, only wants to 
"teach the EU a lesson." 
  Economist Wolfgang Polt said that economic and monetary 
union 
as envisioned under the Maastricht Treaty, would have positive 
effects on growth and cost and eliminate speculation in foreign 
currency. However, in his view, the treaty's convergence 
criteria are unattainable for most countries within the next 
15-40 years. These criteria could be achieved only at the price 
of "stabilization crises." The creation of a single currency by 
1999 is most unlikely. On Tuesday, the Freedom Party of Austria 
[FPOe] strongly criticized the Corrao Pirzio-Biroli, the EU 
ambassador to Austria, who said that if Austria were to vote 
with no on 12 June, membership would not be renegotiated. FPOe 
Chairman Joerg Haider spoke of a Federal Government "EU 
blackmailing campaign" along with "foreign helpers and 
panicmongers." 
  The Association of Austrian Doctors has advocated Austrian 
EU 
entry on conditions that Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina keeps 
his promise that the additional financial burden resulting from 
EU entry would be compensated as promised. 
  On Tuesday, the Council of Catholic Laymen pointed to 
solidarity as a basic value of Catholic social teaching. As an 
integral part of the EU, Austria could do a lot for the poorer 
countries in the world, while as a poorer, isolated country, 
Austria could do nothing. 
  A majority of the provincial government of Lower Austria 
decided on Tuesday to recommend a vote in favor of EU entry to 
the citizens of the province.

<F P=106> [Report signed by B.L.: "Libya -- Reaction From the </F>
Embassy"] 
  [Text] Following our article entitled "Strange 
Belgian-Libyan Tension" published on 28 May, the Libyan Embassy, 
or, to be more precise, "The People's Bureau of the Great 
Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in Brussels," 
expressed its "regret" at our "insinuations" concerning 
Belgian-Libyan relations which, according to the embassy, are 
tension-free and, on the contrary, "under the sign of the 
greatest serenity." 
  Notwithstanding a foreign visit of the Libyan ambassador 
accompanied by a Libyan member of parliament that was made 
without the Foreign Ministry authorization, an event that the 
embassy's clarification does not deny, we had been impelled to 
use the word "tension" by the Libyan ambassador's lament printed 
on the front page of DE STANDAARD on 27 May. Here the diplomat 
complained that Belgium was showing rather more zeal than its 
European and U.S. partners in applying Security Council 
Resolution 883 (requiring the toughening of economic sanctions 
against Tripoli from last December). Indeed, the funds of the 
Libyan Embassy were frozen around the end of April, thus 
preventing the diplomatic mission from continuing to function. 
  On verification, it does appear that this Belgian "zeal" was 
indeed excessive because of technical and administrative 
confusion surrounding the freezing of the Libyan accounts. The 
Finance Ministry charged with applying the royal decree of 17 
March which set out the manner in which Resolution 883 would be 
applied, finally last week had to reopen the embassy's current 
account. 
  Was this a storm in a teacup, as all the interested parties 
are now at pains to point out? Maybe it was. However, as we 
mentioned, mystery still surrounds the "safe deposit box" in 
which our sources, who request anonomity, claim the gendarmes 
found some "strange" things. The Libyan Embassy says it does 
not possess any such box in a Belgian bank.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "How Lasting Is the VLD's Success?"] </F>
  [Text] For Jean-Luc Dehaene, things can hardly go wrong any 
more. His main opponent for Delors' succession, Netherlands 
Prime Minister Lubbers, seems to be virtually defeated. Indeed, 
generally well-informed Spanish newspapers reported that Prime 
Minister Gonzalez no longer supports the Netherlands Christian 
Democrat's candidacy. There was good news from Great Britain, 
too. John Major allegedly no longer intends to pronounce a veto 
against Dehaene. Things would take a dramatic turn for Dehaene 
to be kept out of Delors' seat. 
  For the government, this is obviously not very good news, 
because it will become difficult to keep this coalition together 
without Dehaene. If the outcome of the European elections is 
far from brilliant, the top ministers will certainly want to get 
into the spotlight in the next few months. Coming to the fore, 
as it is called. It is a well-known fact that this is generally 
bad for a cabinet's harmonious functioning. However, if the 
polls published in recent days are confirmed on 12 June, the 
coalition partners have every reason to go on through the end of 
their legislative period. The VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] no 
longer succeeds in reaching the 30 percent it had a few months 
ago. Quite on the contrary, the percentage is slowly but surely 
crumbling off, which could indicate that the VLD's success is 
inflated and far from lasting. It is not inconceivable that the 
recipe worked out by [VLD chairman] Verhofstadt is quite 
perishable. In that case, the situation might brighten up for 
the government parties. All they should do then, is stay in 
power, avoid futile disputes, and postpone the elections as long 
as possible. If, in the meantime, unemployment decreases and a 
better economic situation reduces the public deficit, they could 
present a fairly positive record to the voters at the end of 
1995. 
  At present, there is hardly any sign that the economic 
situation is changing for the better. Moreover, the population 
is just discovering the new taxes and savings included in the 
global plan. So it is possible that the government's popularity 
has now reached rock bottom, and that the future can only be 
better. If it turns out next Sunday [12 June], that the VLD is 
already past its peak, the government parties would have every 
reason to be satisfied. Even if they concede further ground 
compared to 1991, they could breathe more freely, and hope that 
the VLD danger can be averted within the foreseeable future, 
thus keeping Verhofstadt from implementing his liberal ideas. A 
VLD image-building operation can only be implemented once within 
a political career. For the VLD chairman, the next few months 
might well turn out to become an agony.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "People's Party for Freedom and </F>
Democracy and Labor Party Differ on Health Care"] 
  [Text] Health insurance threatens to be a stumbling block 
to the formation of a "purple" coalition comprised of the PvdA 
[Labor Party], the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy], and the D66 [Democrats 66]. That became clear 
yesterday following negotiations between the leaders of the 
three parties, Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo respectively. 
  The VVD and the PvdA have serious differences in viewing the 
future of health care. The PvdA wants to avoid people on the 
lowest incomes paying much more for health care. The PvdA wants 
to make any personal contribution dependent on earnings. If that 
does not seem possible, the PvdA wants a risk insurance linked 
to incomes. The VVD believes that the risk insurance must be 
the same for everyone. 
  Last night Kok described the talks on health care as "a test 
case for the `purple' coalition." Kok believes that extra 
charges for the lowest paid in this area must be "limited as 
much as possible" because "they already find it difficult to 
meet these costs." 
  Yesterday, Kok and D66 leader Van Mierlo did not reject VVD 
leader Bolkestein's suggestion to form the new government on a 
5-5-4 basis: Five ministers for the PvdA, including the prime 
ministership, five for the VVD, and four for the D66. 
  Van Mierlo described Bolkestein's proposal as "workable and 
conceivable." Kok stated that "the negotiations must first be 
concluded in terms of content before considering the question of 
the allocation of ministerial posts." The PvdA has 37 seats in 
the new parliament, the VVD 31, and the D66 24. Kok: "Working 
on the basis of 14, a 5-5-4 split seems logical in a way, but 
other forms of reasoning are perhaps possible." 
  Bolkestein repeated yesterday that he would not be a member 
of the new cabinet. "I do not want to commit myself, but my 
preference is to be party leader, for the simple reason that I 
am a supporter of dualism and my hands would be tied too much as 
a minister." He stated that if Kok were to be prime minister, 
it is likely that he would be assisted by two deputy prime 
ministers, one from the VVD and one from the D66. 
  The negotiators were again hopeful yesterday on the progress 
of the talks. Van Mierlo: "It is getting more difficult, but 
we are getting there." Bolkestein: "I have become steadily 
more optimistic in recent weeks." 
  Prime Minister Lubbers said in Leiden yesterday that "the 
party leaders and the politicians who have been appointed by the 
Crown to assess the feasibility of the various coalitions, 
should try to complete their work this month. I am not against 
a `purple' coalition, but it is desirable for it to be achieved 
in the short term. The country needs a government," Lubbers 
stated. A "purple" coalition is considered to be a good outcome 
on the basis of the election results.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Vietnamese Must Leave the Country"] </F>
  [Text] The 350 Vietnamese asylum-seekers who fled to the 
Netherlands from Czechoslovakia a few years ago have until the 
end of the year to leave the country. If they don't go, they 
will be repatriated to Vietnam. 
  Tomorrow in Hanoi, the Netherlands and Vietnam are to sign 
an 
agreement determining the procedures for the return of this 
group, Foreign Minister Kooijmans told the Second Chamber. Some 
350 people are involved. Vietnam has agreed not to persecute 
them on their return. That was the condition required by the 
Second Chamber before it would approve the agreement. The 
Justice Ministry has given the refugees six months to leave the 
country of their own accord, after which time they will be 
forcibly expelled. 
  Asylum-seekers who return to Vietnam of their own accord can 
count on assistance from the International Organization of 
Migration and from UNICEF, the UN refugee organization. The 
group in question are Vietnamese who worked as contract workers 
in Czechoslovakia before fleeing to the Netherlands following 
the "velvet" revolution, for fear of discrimination. A total of 
500 Vietnamese came to the Netherlands, about 150 of whom have 
since voluntarily returned to Prague or Vietnam. 
  The Netherlands did not want to recognize them as refugees 
as 
Justice Minister Kosto did not believe there were any grounds 
for doing so. The Second Chamber found return to Vietnam 
undesirable as long as the Vietnamese Government had not 
guaranteed they would not be persecuted.

<F P=106> [Report by Anne Segall: "OECD Sees Healthy UK Economy"] </F>
  [Text] Paris -- The outlook for the British economy is 
favourable, according to an Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development [OECD] report prepared in Paris and 
due to be published in the middle of next month. 
  The OECD, which has just completed its annual review of the 
British economy, is confident that the April rise in taxes will 
fail to dent the recovery. 
  It believes that consumers will dip into their savings to 
maintain spending with higher exports and a revival in 
investment helping to broaden the base of the recovery 
  The OECD report includes a marginal downward revision from 
2.9 per cent to 2.8 per cent in the forecast for economic growth 
this year, but an upward revision to 3.25 per cent in its 
forecast for 1995. 
  Unlike the European Commission which recently warned that 
the 
British economy would lose momentum, the OECD believes that the 
recovery will gather pace through this year and into 1995. 
  It is also sanguine about the outlook for inflation, which 
is 
expected to remain comfortably below the 4 per cent ceiling set 
by the government for both this year and next. 
  However, senior officials are concerned about the recent 
shakeout in the gilts market and believe a modest rise in bank 
base rates should be delivered "quite soon" to prevent the 
deterioration in inflation expectations from feeding through 
into wage setting behaviour. 
  Draft copies of the OECD's assessment of British economic 
prospects have been seen by the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, who 
was in Paris on Tuesday for the organisation's annual 
ministerial meeting. He returned to London early yesterday to 
discuss interest rate policy with Eddie George, the governor of 
the Bank of England. 
  The OECD dismisses fears that the brisker than expected 
recovery will create capacity problems which could rekindle 
inflationary pressures. To the delight of Treasury ministers, 
the forthcoming report will argue that the performance of the 
economy has been transformed by the reforms of the 1980's and 
that Britain is now highly competitive and well placed to take 
advantage of the recovery currently under way in Europe. 
  While talk of a miracle is seen as exaggerated, officials in 
Paris note that "something positive has definitely taken place." 
  Next month's reports will include graphs showing that while 
Britain used to be able to achieve higher levels of productivity 
only during periods of cyclical expansion, efficiency gains were 
made right through the 1990's recession. 
  Since leaving the European exchange rate mechanism in 
September 1992, the British economy has achieved an unusual 
combination of reasonably rapid growth low inflation and a net 
improvement in its trade position, something that the OECD 
describes as a "hat-trick." 
  The Treasury is also in the process of revising up its 
forecasts of 2.5 per cent growth this year and next but is 
likely to take a slightly more cautious view. 
  The OECD's upbeat assessment of the British economy will be 
accompanied by a special section in which the government's 
health service reforms will receive enthusiastic approval.

<F P=106> [Article by Klaus Wickel, president of the IG Metall Metal </F>
Workers Union: "`The Economic Community Has Been Successful, 
But Social Problems Are Mounting'"] 
  [Text] The Europe saga illustrates the opportunities and 
dangers that lie in the unions relationship with Europe. Zeus, 
who worshipped the king's daughter Europa, assumed the form of a 
white bull and behaved so gently that the girl climbed onto his 
back. Before she knew what had happened, the steer swam across 
to Crete with her where she became Zeus' lover. Not only was 
the girl deceived, but so was Zeus' wife Hera, who in fact 
realized what was going on very quickly. 
  What does this old myth have to do with the unions and 
Europe? Well, the unions neither want to be the betrayed wife 
nor do they want to be the seduced innocent. The European 
integration process has created an enormous economic and 
financial zone, but Europe as a social policy zone has remained 
an illusion. From the very beginning, the German trade unions 
were positively disposed toward Europe. They grinned and bore 
it as economic integration made progress over decades and social 
considerations were neglected. They came out in favor of the 
Rome treaties although social questions were excluded. There 
are good reasons why Europe should exist. One motive is that of 
securing peace in Europe, and that hope has not been 
disappointed. Europe has experienced a long period of peace, 
and the war in former Yugoslavia reminds us how valuable peace 
is. It also reminds us that peace is always in danger and that 
nationalist and ethnic excesses can quickly turn into war. The 
European economic community was an exceptionally successful 
venture. To quote Willy Brandt, it has become "a unique zone of 
prosperity." However, these successes cannot conceal the fact 
that social problems in Europe are mounting up. It is a scandal 
that there are almost 20 million unemployed people in Europe. 
Almost one-fifth of people under the age of 25 are without 
work. I do not want to become Cassandra, but this challenge 
must be addressed. If that is not done, then there is a danger 
that the entire European integration process will run into 
difficulties. We should consider the current weariness and 
skepticism with regard to Europe to be a warning sign, the 
writing on the wall. The writing on the wall reads that Europe 
must be democratic and social, or it will not exist at all. Is 
it really surprising that support for Europe has been crumbling 
away? Is it really surprising that anti-Europe groups are being 
formed and that the contradictions that are appearing in the 
European unification process are being used to achieve political 
capital? 
  The unions also face the challenge of having to rethink 
their 
position on Europe. I am not concerned about formulating 
radical, verbal positions on Europe, but, within the limits of 
what is possible, to use the German presidency to place concrete 
proposals on the table. Three demands are of key importance for 
the German unions. First, the guidelines for European employee 
councils have been discussed for over 20 years and they must now 
be approved despite the policy of obstruction being practiced by 
Unice [European employers union]. The Federal Government 
supports this demand and the next council meeting, at which the 
guidelines will be on the agenda, should be considered an acid 
test. The commission's patience with respect to the formulation 
and reformulation of the guidelines knows no end and that also 
applies to the unions. 
  Second, a European policy on employment must be implemented 
so that the Europe of the future is not a Europe of the 
unemployed. The hopes contained in the Ceccini report, which 
forecast the creation of millions of jobs proved to be illusory. 
French President Mitterrand has assured [EU President Jacques] 
Delors of his support. By contrast, the German Government has, 
in an irresponsible manner, blocked the employment policy 
initiative with its monetary veto. 
  The Federal Government should abandon these stances. A 
Franco-German package solution is conceivable, one in which both 
sides will have to bear their costs. Why should we not embark 
on unconventional paths and not seek a reduction for the 
duration of the reconstruction of eastern Germany according to 
the British pattern? Why should we not respond to the French 
side with regard to the European bond issue, which, by virtue of 
its job creation impetus can also satisfy German interests? 
This kind of package would satisfy all sides, because an end to 
the skepticism about Europe, which is spreading like a plague, 
would also benefit Europe as a center for business. 
  Third, the British, who want to use the fact that they have 
not signed the protocol on social affairs in order to improve 
their position as a center for business, should be forced to 
sign the protocol. Why should we not attempt to reduce British 
skepticism by bringing about an intelligent reshaping of the 
agriculture sector and thus make them more ready to achieve a 
compromise. 
  The issue of shaping Europe as a social policy zone is also 
a 
question of Europe's political legitimacy at the same time. 
Acceptance of the European unification process can only be 
increased if European agencies adopt a resolute approach in 
eliminating shortcomings in social policy and democracy. In 
following such a course, they can rely on and count on the 
support of the German trade unions.

"The Test"] 
  [Text] For their grandfathers it was a vision, for their 
grandchildren a bit of reality: united Europe. On 12 June, 
Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer will decide on the makeup 
of the next European Parliament. 
  Whom the grandsons will vote for is no secret. The Frenchman 
will vote for "the other Europe." No surprise, since the 
descendant of the great general is himself running for this 
bourgeois ticket that has a strong nationalist bias. Konrad 
Adenauer will probably back his grandfather's party, which he 
wants to represent in the Cologne City Council in October. How 
the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the other German 
parties will do in the European election has been examined by 
the Basis Research Institute between 16 and 20 May exclusively 
for FOCUS. 
  Only three of 26 parties (23 nationwide, the CDU with 15 
land 
tickets, in Bavaria the Christian Social Union [CSU], the German 
Family Party in the Saarland) can be certain that they will be 
represented in the European Parliament: CDU/CSU, SPD, and 
Alliance 90/Greens. 
  The CDU/CSU and the SPD come neck-and-neck when people are 
asked: "Whom would you vote for if the European election were 
held next Sunday?" Of the approximately 1,500 citizens in 
eastern and western Germany who were asked in the middle of May, 
38.5 percent opted for the two major parties each. A possible 
explanation for this stalemate: What the two parties say in 
connection with Europe is only marginally different. Peace, 
internal security, and jobs are the main issues. Alliance 
90/Greens follows with a clear margin: 8.5 percent. 
  June 12 will be thrilling for the CSU. Because the number of 
people entitled to vote increased by 15 million since the 
conclusion of German unity, the 5-percent hurdle is now higher 
for the CSU. So for them it is decisive to mobilize as many 
voters as possible in Bavaria to prevent a landslide as in 1989, 
when the CSU lost 11.8 percent compared to the 1984 European 
election, even though in absolute terms it scored 216,000 votes 
more. 
  If, say, the turnout is 62 percent at the national level, 
but 
only 51 percent in Bavaria, the CSU will need some 42.5 percent 
of the Bavarian votes. "No problem," says Ingo Friedrich, the 
always optimistic leading CSU candidate. "Realistically," he 
anticipates "45 percent plus x," even though CSU Chairman Theo 
Waigel has set a higher goal -- "50 percent plus x." Not 
without reason: For the CSU it may become difficult to get in 
if, as a result of the many local elections to be held on the 
same day, the voter turnout is very high at the federal level. 
There is agreement within the CSU leadership on one thing: It 
would be a "fatal signal" for the Landtag election on 25 
September if the party were to be thrown out of the Strasbourg 
Parliament. 
  In the 1994 super election year, the European election is 
going to be a test for the Free Democratic Party of Germany 
[FDP]. With a projected score of 4.5 percent, its reentry into 
the European Parliament is touch and go. The FDP might still 
manage to get in again, but there is a serious danger that it 
will not. The argument that the FDP is needed as a party that 
can help create a majority is irrelevant on 12 June. Europe's 
citizens only elect a parliament --not a government. 
  The situation is particularly sensitive for leading 
candidate 
Uta Wuerfel. "On principle, I do not make any predictions 
regarding the election result," Wuerfel, who is one of the very 
few really prominent German candidates for the European 
Parliament, said. She knows what is at stake. "For the FDP 
this election is of particular importance. It is not merely a 
question of the liberal voice in the European Parliament," but 
the voters will determine Europe's future course. 
  There is also more at stake for Uta Wuerfel personally: If 
the FDP were to fail she would have to look for a new job. She 
will not run again for the Bundestag, and she rejected a 
position in the party presidium. Moreover, the FDP must refute 
the downward trend that has been projected for the Bundestag 
election. 
  The smaller parties and Maastricht opponents who want to 
mobilize protest voters in the European election will stand no 
chance. The Republikaner, who scored 7.1 percent in the last 
election, are currently projected to score 2 percent. The Party 
of Democratic Socialism [PDS], which is running for the first 
time in the European election, stands at 4 percent. All others 
-- from Manfred Brunner's "Alliance of Free Citizens" to the 
Instead Party and the "Ungovernable" -- can count on no more 
than 4 percent together. 
  The Federal Government and the Bundestag, the European 
Parliament and the German mission of the EU Commission have 
spent no less than 14 million German marks [DM] to mobilize 
Germans for the 12 June poll. Not without reason: "In the view 
of the citizens, the European election is of rather little 
importance," Werner Langen, leading candidate in 
Rhineland-Palatinate complains. Langen has so far been the head 
of the CDU Land group, and now replaced longstanding European 
Parliament President Egon Klepsch at the top of the ticket, has 
noticed a "certain tiredness with Europe" on the part of the 
Germans. Claudia Roth, number one of the Greens, even speaks of 
"disenchantment with Europe." 
  Yet, the FOCUS survey has not confirmed these assessments. 
The expected turnout of approximately 63 percent is slightly 
superior to that of 1989, while as many as 69 percent even said 
that they intend to participate in the vote. What is more, 
two-thirds are in favor of a united Europe and regard Germany's 
membership in the European Union [EU] as "a good thing," even 
though one cannot ignore the differences between east and west: 
People asked in the old laender are significantly more 
enthusiastic about Europe than east Germans (72 and 69 percent 
in the west, compared to 45 and 52 percent in the east). 
  So is the European election more than just a token election? 
This is certainly what the candidates would say. Bundestag 
deputy Peter Kittelmann, nominated as number one by the Berlin 
CDU group, points to the "process of continual expansion of 
powers of the parliament since the first direct election in 
1979," such as the right to codecision in the lawmaking process 
and the establishment of commissions, which has become possible 
since Maastricht. 
  Yet, what SPD leading candidate Klaus Haensch has to say on 
the importance of the European election will probably play a 
much more significant role for the Germans: "The German parties 
know that the election result will set trends for all elections 
of the year. This is why 12 June is being taken so seriously."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Hans Joerg Sottorf: "Kinkel Practices </F>
Tightrope Walk With Moscow"] 
  [Text] After NATO defense ministers told the Russians at 
the Brussels North Atlantic Cooperation Council meeting that 
they would not be conceded a special status in their 
relationship with NATO, not even within the framework of the 
Partnership for Peace program, the foreign ministers of the 
Atlantic alliance at their meeting in Istanbul now want to prove 
their diplomatic skills and make this position clearer to the 
prestige-oriented Russians, which, in this case, means that they 
will have to make their position appear more attractive. 
  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will play a special role in 
this connection, because the NATO allies, the Americans in 
particular, have entrusted Germany with a crucial role for 
shaping relations between the members of the North Atlantic 
alliance and the states or successor states of the former Warsaw 
Pact. Typically, the diplomats will act more cautiously than the 
defense ministers, who tend to prefer a clear language. 
According to internal preliminary discussions, in Istanbul 
Kinkel will defend the principle that participants will not be 
treated differently within the Partnership for Peace scheme, not 
even Russia, which has still not signed the framework agreement. 
  In diplomatic circles in Bonn, it has been pointed out that 
one must understand the claims of an international and nuclear 
power such as Russia to an outstanding position in European 
foreign and security policy. However, it has been said that one 
could not formalize such a position, but, at the most, 
"institutionalize" it. Yet, so far nobody knows exactly how this 
can be done without upsetting the other members of the program 
and making them call for full NATO membership immediately. In 
Bonn the question marks that determine the discussion on the 
future European security policy are by no means being ignored. 
In such cases, the diplomats tend to bank on the time factor -- 
and this is what they are doing now. From the period of 
transition, Russia has belonged to the NATO Cooperation Council, 
which was conceived as a bridge to NATO. Some members of this 
council were seeking early full membership, which caused 
controversial debates. That Russia should not and would not 
become a NATO member was obvious to everybody. This is what 
generated the American idea to create a kind of preparatory 
program through Partnership for Peace for countries that will 
one day achieve the political and economic conditions for full 
NATO membership. 
  Strictly speaking, Russia does not belong to this group, 
because it wants to remain outside NATO. However, out of 
political considerations, nobody would or could exclude Moscow 
from participation either, which has created an almost 
schizophrenic situation. 
  Officials in Bonn meanwhile know to what extent Moscow is 
anxious, for reasons of domestic policy, not only to make the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council superfluous but to devalue 
NATO in general by upgrading the CSCE to an umbrella security 
institution. Yet, this plan should not work out, something on 
which the Federal Government and its Western partners all agree 
on. "In these insecure times of change we still need NATO," 
they say. Whether the Russians will jump on the tightrope of 
noncommittal declarations of intent, which the NATO foreign 
ministers intend to put up in Istanbul, remains, however, 
uncertain.

<F P=106> ["cr"-attributed report: "Negative Image Deters"] </F>
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 4-5 Jun -- The Federation of German 
Industry (BDI), the Federation of German Chambers of Industry 
and Commerce (DIHT), and the Ibero-America Association (IAV) 
will shortly establish a "Latin America Discussion Group." The 
activities in the region must be coordinated and strategically 
oriented, the Latin America initiative of the three supporters 
mentioned above says. The starting point of their concept is 
the insight that the negative image of Latin America, where 
involvement has long been stable but rather limited, has 
deterred new investors or people interested in exports from 
German industry. 
  The profound reform process of Latin American states, the 
"victory of the market economy," is seen only by insiders. "For 
German industry, Latin America threatens to become a continent 
for specialists only," the associations warn. Above all, 
medium-sized and smaller companies have missed new opportunities 
for getting involved in Latin America, the authors of the 
initiative criticize. In contrast, large German industries can 
partly point to positions that dominate the market. 
  The expansion of the foreign trade infrastructure, the use 
of 
foreign trade instruments as a whole, but also the lack of 
planned diplomacy by visits and contacts are seen as the main 
reasons for the dismal situation. As a result, the framework 
conditions for entrepreneurial involvement are deteriorating 
even further, it is said. In addition, the BDI clearly 
criticizes Bonn's thrift policy, which has led to dramatic 
cutbacks also in the system of chambers. The bad classification 
of the Latin American trading partners in connection with the 
reform of the Hermes system is also felt to be of little help. 
  After its founding, the discussion group of the three 
associations, which will be joined by the Foreign Ministry, the 
Economics Ministry, the Development Aid Ministry, and the 
spokesman of the Latin American chambers, will engage in similar 
activities as the APA [Asia-Pacific Committee]. One of the most 
urgent tasks consists of: 

  -  Working out a political framework 
concept of the Federal Government for Latin America; 
  -  Planning of 
regional conferences in Latin America and of entrepreneurs' 
conferences in Germany, which is to address primarily 
medium-sized companies; 
  -  Improving the transparency of activities 
of the Federal Government and the laender as well as of the 
economic promotion companies, institutes, chambers, and 
associations; 
  -  Improving public relations work; 
  -  expanding and 
further developing foreign trade instruments with the goal of 
making involvement in Latin America also possible for 
medium-sized companies and of promoting cooperation with Latin 
American companies. 

  In detail, this means the expansion and interlacement of the 
network of foreign trade chambers and the coordination of a 
concept of fairs and exhibitions with regional focal points. In 
addition, there is the improvement of the coordination of 
officials sent by chambers, the Technical Cooperation 
Association (GTZ), and political foundations. Furthermore, it 
would be desirable to jointly plan trips by Federal Government 
officials and industrial figures, giving priority to regional 
focal countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wolfgang Schauble, chairman of the CDU/CSU </F>
Bundestag Group, by Heinz Riebsamen and Cornelia von Wrangel; 
place and date not given: "`We Must Continue Consistently 
Curbing Expenditure'"] 
  [Excerpt] [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] The CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union]/CSU [Christian Social Union] has 
provided the interior minister for the past 11 years. Is the 
security situation getting out of control and the government 
unable to keep up with these developments? 
  [Schaeuble] The development of crime is something that the 
government can only influence in a very limited way. People's 
belief in values has become much weaker. We concentrate on 
material values. That is also a consequence of these past 
decades that have seen such a growth in prosperity. Perhaps it 
is also a consequence of the fact that we have avoided certain 
basic questions about the state community. This rigid 
concentration on increasing material prosperity promotes a 
tendency for people to concentrate on their own gains to the 
extent that they only feel that regulations can impose 
limitations on their conduct if there is a danger of being 
caught. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] Does the state not 
lose the basis of its existence if it can no longer ensure 
security for its citizens? 
  [Schaeuble] Things go even further than that. The basis of 
every liberal form of life is that people adhere to certain 
norms with respect to human coexistence, that they feel bound by 
respect for the life, property, and basic rights of others. If 
that can only be sanctioned and implemented by means of state 
norms, bureaucracy, surveillance, and the police, a basic 
foundation of freedom is already endangered. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] The interior 
minister has advised citizens to care more about their own 
security. Is that a form of partial capitulation? 
  [Schaeuble] No, the interior minister simply pointed out 
something that is quite obvious. In a liberal democracy, the 
state cannot do everything. That does not mean that people 
should install as many burglar alarms as they can in their 
homes. It means that one should feel a measure of 
responsibility for the broader social context, follow what is 
going on, and overcome the anonymity that probably also has some 
bearing on the massive increase in crime. 
  [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] How has the world 
of politics responded to this development? 
  [Schaeuble] Citizens always expect solutions from politics. 
There is no patent solution for developments where a variety of 
factors are involved. That does not mean that politicians do 
not have to act. The laender, which are responsible for 
security, must make security a high priority. That the police 
get bogged down in a mass of paperwork is, of course, an evil 
that one can change. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A special commission of the Bavarian Land Office of 
Criminal Investigation [LKA] has crushed an international drug 
ring. A spokesman for the LKA said in Munich today, that in a 
large-scale operation in Munich, Hamburg, Duesseldorf, and 
Nuremberg earlier this week, police apprehended 14 Germans and 
Turks. They are suspected of having imported tonnes of heroin 
to Spain, Italy, and Germany. The spokesman added that another 
10 persons were arrested in northern Italy and Spain. In the 
operation, the officials also detected comprehensive money 
laundering practices.

<F P=106> [Report by Franz Nickel: "Hardly Any War Without German </F>
Arms"] 
  [Text] It was hardly of any news value when the 300 
participants in the annual general meeting of the Goettingen 
"Society for Threatened Peoples" strongly criticized German arms 
exports to almost all crisis spots in the Third World, and to 
dictators and governments that "violate human rights." After 
all, the statement in the relevant resolution that "in the past 
few years, there was hardly a genocide that did not also involve 
fire from German arms..." is meanwhile regarded as a sure fact. 
  Even two years ago, the United Nations demonstrated that 
with 
arms exports totaling $2.53 billion in 1991, Germany, for the 
first time, moved up to third place in the list of major arms 
exporters behind the United States and Russia. 
  What is probably less well-known are the deals in connection 
with the dissolution of the National People's Army (NVA) of the 
GDR, and the "scrapping" of its sizable military technology. 
  After the last NVA flag was lowered on 2 October 1990, 
experts from the Defense Ministry in Bonn and the Bundeswehr 
Command East could hardly believe what they counted: They had 
not expected the more than 2,200 combat tanks, 7,000 armored 
vehicles, 2,400 artillery pieces, 400 combat aircraft, 57 
warships, 296,000 tonnes of ammunition, and 1.2 million handguns. 
  However, other things came to light, too. After the Modrow 
government stopped all arms sales on the part of the GDR, the 
last GDR Government under De Maiziere decided to sell as much of 
the sensitive heritage as possible. Defense and Disarmament 
Minister Rainer Eppelmann, a former priest of the opposition and 
conscientious objector, and now a deputy for the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] in the Bundestag, in the summer of 1990 
issued Order 31/90 to "step up efforts...to sell military 
materiel." This was done through "effective marketing." A few 
days before German unity, in August/September 1990, Eppelmann's 
ministry concluded 44 contracts with other countries or private 
companies on the supply of NVA material. 
  According to insiders, the trick was to conclude these 
armament sales still under the GDR Government so that the future 
all-German Government could not be held responsible. 
  It was bad luck for Eppelmann that a short time after 
unification he was charged with extensive shady NVA dealings, 
resulting in billions [currency not specified] of damage to the 
Bundeswehr through the squandering of national assets. Yet, 
investigations came to nothing.... 
  Independent of such dubious last-minute sales, after the 
GDR's accession to the FRG, the question remained: What should 
one do with the old burden inherited from the NVA? The 
objective was to get rid of everything by 1995. Yet, the 
Defense Ministry in Bonn expected that getting rid of the almost 
300,000 tonnes of ammunition alone would take 10 years and cost 
5,000 marks [DM] for each tonne to take apart and discard -- 
altogether DM1.5 billion. Moreover, the guarding and clearing 
of the 3,315 buildings cost a lot of money each day. 
  Requests for second-hand NVA arms from more than 70 European 
and oversees countries created the idea in the Defense Ministry 
to turn "scrap" into money and political assets through generous 
donations. 
  The Federal Government donated NVA equipment worth DM740 
million to the United States for its Gulf war forces. 
Air-to-air missiles, launcher vehicles, guided missiles, motor 
vehicles, and ammunition went to Israel. Turkey received German 
tanks, artillery pieces, and aircraft free of charge. 
  Uruguay's fleet bought five minesweepers from the NVA 
heritage and two barges for DM3.1 million. The U.S. Navy picked 
up, among other things, the Hiddensee of the Tarantul rocket 
fast patrol boats. The Belgian BEIJ-MA group took the Dessau, 
Tangerhuette, Genthin, and Rosslau minesweepers. The Indonesian 
Navy bought 39 warships from GDR stocks at a price of $1.1 
billion. The United Nations received L60-type trucks. A total 
of 475 water transporters went to Uruguay and Ecuador in 
humanitarian aid, 751 trucks were sold to Russia and Ukraine, 
pontoon vehicles to Greece, ammunition to Finland and Greece. 
In eastern Germany itself, all kinds of motor vehicles, 
multicars, fork trucks, tank trucks, snowplows, cranes, field 
bakeries, fire trucks, and emergency power generators from the 
enormous stocks are being sold to private persons. 
  How much money has been made or what infringements against 
the arms export laws there were remains an open question. 
  Exports of NVA material to Turkey has become a permanent 
political scandal. 
  Apart from Bonn's arms exports to Turkey, which have caused 
a 
great deal of controversy for decades, according to official 
information from the Federal Defense Ministry, the following has 
been supplied to the Bosporus since April 1994 from the stocks 
of the former GDR Army: 300 BTR-60 PB armored personnel 
carriers; 4,996 RPG 7 bazookas, including 197,130 grenades; 222 
heavy machine guns; 2,491 light machine guns; 303,934 
Kalashnikov submachine guns; 20 KMT 5 mine detectors; 500,000 
steel helmets; and hundreds of millions of rounds of various 
ammunition -- altogether worth $1.6 billion. 
  For two years, human rights organizations, former NVA 
officers, and journalists have documented in letter and picture 
that such arms from GDR stocks have been used to suppress the 
Kurds. This is why the Federal Government put a temporary halt 
to arms supplies in early April. Yet already in May it was said 
that the accusations that German military technology would be 
used against the Kurds have "not proved sound." Exports have 
resumed. Last week, Ankara reported officially that 1,168 
Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) guerrilla fighters had been 
killed since April....

<F P=106> ["J.J."-signed editorial: "Economic Spring"] </F>
  [Text] The latest economic data leave no doubt about the 
fact that economic spring has set in. The economic situation in 
Germany is improving. Recovery following the long and deep 
recession is gaining strength. This is not just a favorable and 
politically helpful message for the government in the 1994 super 
election year, but also a sign of hope that could improve the 
mood in the country. As is so often the case following a 
cyclical slow-down, the mood is worse than the situation. The 
substantial increase of economic output in western Germany shows 
that economic recovery is progressing. In eastern Germany, too, 
the growth rate has probably accelerated. Anyway, the 
production decline apparently has largely ended. 
  However, there is no reason for excessive euphoria. The 
sharp increase of the GNP in the first quarter is also 
attributable to the fact that in the same period of the 
preceding year there was one of the largest postwar slumps. The 
current economic recovery is only owing to exports and a 
gradually decreasing construction boom. However, investment, 
which is a typical driving force for growth, has not been 
stepped up. In addition, because of the financial burdens on 
consumers and lasting unemployment, the demand for consumer 
goods will probably remain low. Moreover, irrespective of 
economic recovery, there will still be many difficulties. In 
international competition, wage costs and taxes in Germany as an 
investment and production center are still too high. This is 
above all reflected by the gloomy situation on the labor market 
where demand is increasing slowly and structural change 
represents a heavy burden. 
  Nonetheless, the longer-term prospects have improved. The 
low pay settlements and further rationalization measures allow 
companies to produce more profitably. They have become more 
competitive. These are favorable conditions for new investment 
and -- consequently -- the creation of new jobs. However, in 
addition to low interest rates, this also requires the tax 
burden to be reduced as soon as possible, not as a reward, but 
as an encouragement for more growth.

<F P=106> ["bag"-signed report: "Eastern Towns Invest Twice as Much </F>
as Western Towns"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- In 1995, east German municipalities 
will invest about twice as much per inhabitant as their western 
counterparts. Despite substantial reductions in personnel 
levels, personnel costs will remain the main problems for 
municipality financial departments. Municipalities in the east 
employ 370 full-time employees for every 10,000 inhabitants 
compared to just 136 in the west. 
  According to a study conducted by the Institute for the 
German Economy [IW] published in IW-TRENDS, revenue in the 
eastern municipalities will rise by an annual average of 6.5 
percent and will thus increase more substantially than 
expenditure, which will grow by 4 percent. This means that the 
deficit will fall from 5.5 billion German marks [DM] to DM3 
billion. 
  Compared to the west, the revenue and expenditure of the 
municipalities in the east will grow substantially faster: 
Between 1991 and 1993, revenue in the east rose by an annual 
average of 10 percent and by 6.5 percent in the west. On the 
expenditure side, the ratio was 17 percent to 7.5 percent. 
  There is a substantial difference between the structure of 
municipal finance in the east and in the west. In the old 
laender, tax revenues account for barely 40 percent of the 
budgets. In the east, they account for just 5 percent. 
Alongside the collapse of production and the extremely high 
level of unemployment, the sum of DM600 free of income tax is 
also a factor. In addition, the tax on business assets will not 
be levied until the end of 1995. 
  Starting from a low level, tax revenue rose as a result of 
substantial increases in wages and salaries. In 1993, it 
amounted to DM5 billion, which is twice as much as in 1991, and 
thus accounted for a good 9 percent of expenditure. The IW 
assumes that in 1995, the share will be 11 percent. 
  The second direct source of revenue, municipal charges, 
contributed more to municipal budgets than taxes (4.9 percent). 
In 1995, the ratio should be 9 percent to 11 percent, according 
to the IW. The explanation for the relatively low revenue from 
charges -- in municipalities in the west, it estimated that 
charges will account for 15 percent of revenue in 1995 -- in 
those in the east, some charges are not collected, such as those 
for sewage treatment and street cleaning. About half the 
revenue from charges in the east is used for kindergartens and 
nursing homes. 
  The low level of self-financing capacity on the part of east 
German municipalities makes it clear that they are dependent on 
being allotted funds at the federal and laender levels and from 
the German Unity Fund. The latter will cease at the end of this 
year, but allotments for specific purposes and assistance with 
debts will increase at the same time. Compared to 1991, the 
revenues from taxes and charges will only rise by 8.6 percentage 
points to 20 percent of overall revenue. That will represent an 
improvement in financial capacity, but "not to an adequate 
degree," says the IW. 
  In 1991, municipal revenue per inhabitant reached 96 percent 
of the level in the west and will be somewhat higher than in the 
west in 1995: DM3,898 in the east compared to DM3,534 in the 
west. Expenditure has evolved in a similar direction. In 1991, 
personal and materials expenditure as well as investment were 
slightly above the western level, whereas interest rates and 
social services were markedly below it. According to the IW, 
the last two elements will be closer to western levels by the 
end of 1995. In the case of per capita expenditure on 
personnel, there will be a slight increase in the gap with the 
west and a substantial one in the case of investment. 
  According to the IW, "only slight progress" is being made in 
reducing personnel. Towns without administrative subdistricts 
"only" reduced personnel by 18 percent between the middle of 
1992 and the middle of 1993, and those with administrative 
subunits reduced personnel by 30 percent during the same period. 
Only "forced reductions" can create more room for maneuver for 
self-financed investment. 
  The continued increase in investment is striking. The IW 
estimates that in 1995, the eastern municipalities will invest 
twice as much as their western counterparts. In 1993, local 
communities financed 13.4 percent of all investment in the new 
laender, whereas the figure in the west was only 7.9 percent. 
  The rapid increase in debt on the part of eastern 
municipalities has led to a situation in which per capita 
interest payments have increased by a factor of 10 between 1991 
and 1995. The per capita level of debt is DM1,406. It is true 
that it is only half the level in the west, but in 1991, eastern 
municipalities had practically no debts at all, the institute 
stressed.

<F P=106> [Report by Francoise Varenne report: "Clinton-Chirac </F>
Discussions"] 
  [Text] Jacques Chirac [mayor of Paris and Rally for the 
Republic, RPR, president] met yesterday with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton. The half-hour meeting took place in U.S. 
Ambassador Pamela Harriman's residence on the rue du Faubourg 
St. Honore. The mayor of Paris was accompanied by Didier 
Quentin, the city's international relations director, and Pierre 
Lellouche, his foreign policy and defense adviser. Bill 
Clinton's delegation included U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and Thomas McLarty, the President's chief of the 
staff. Jacques Chirac and Bill Clinton spent most of the 
meeting discussing international affairs, and in particular the 
Bosnian conflict. On this issue, they were agreed that the arms 
embargo should not be lifted. The RPR president also stressed 
the seriousness of the situation in Algeria, which threatens to 
destabilize the whole Maghreb region. Where nuclear testing is 
concerned, Jacques Chirac stressed the need for France to carry 
out a few more tests before switching over to test simulations. 
For his part, Bill Clinton expressed his concern about the 
growing risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
(nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological) and the danger that 
this represents, insofar as they could be used by terrorist 
groups. 
<H5>  Working Group </H5>
  Moreover, Jacques Chirac explained at length to the U.S. 
President his views on the urgent and vital need to tackle the 
narcotics problem at the production stage. In particular, he 
stressed the considerable increase in the production of heroin 
and its consequences, especially for young people. 
  Chirac also underscored the need to define a policy and take 
action, possibly under the aegis of the United Nations, to 
encourage countries producing narcotics to think about promoting 
alternative sources of revenue for their farmers. 
  President Clinton showed much interest in this proposal. The 
two men decided that regular contacts would be established 
between experts on both sides and that a working group would be 
set up to define a policy for the fight against narcotics 
production.

<F P=106> [Report signed "O.P.": "Clinton Tells National Assembly: </F>
`America Wants Europe To Be Strong'"] 
  [Excerpts] Every measure had been taken to guarantee the 
safety of the President of the United States. Even inside the 
National Assembly, everything had been strictly ordered: 
Journalists were banned from the corridors, elevators had been 
locked, etc. It would appear that these precautions were 
"imposed" by the FBI [as published], which was represented in 
force at the National Assembly. 
  Bill Clinton spoke to parliament for half an hour yesterday 
afternoon. He was the third head of state to be accorded this 
honor, following in the footsteps of President Wilson in 1919 
and the king of Spain last year. It is true that the National 
Assembly is expected to play host to more heads of state since 
[Assembly Speaker] Philippe Seguin took the initiative. 
Yesterday, almost all the deputies were present to hear the 
President of the United States speak, and they gave him 
sustained applause. [passage omitted] 
  Philippe Seguin had welcomed President Clinton and recalled 
"the magnificent heroism and immense sacrifices" that had 
enabled "the liberation of General de Gaulle's France" and 
"victory over a common enemy." 
  The Assembly speaker then stressed the need to be vigilant: 
"Today, as in 1919, everything seems possible, the worst and the 
best of things. On the one hand, we are witnessing the return 
of the hates and conflicts that had been buried in history and 
which are now coupled with the previously unknown threats 
regarding the environment and the proliferation of weapons. On 
the other hand, in southern Africa and in the Middle East, hopes 
have sprung up of a peace that we thought was unattainable, 
while the cause of liberty seems to be scoring many points." 
Mr. Seguin continued: "We are living what could be described 
as a new postwar period, one of those rare and ephemeral periods 
where history hesitates between peace and chaos, between justice 
and strength. The hope is there, amid many different dangers, 
of a new, fairer, and more peaceful world order." We therefore 
have to work at building "a new world order," he said, with a 
view to "organizing a fair and equitable international society." 
  The Assembly speaker concluded his speech by saying: "Let us 
have no doubt about it, this fresh impetus will find France and 
the United States side by side, as at every decisive moment when 
freedom and world peace were at stake. The shared commitment of 
our nations has been sealed by this brotherhood in arms and 
hearts which, from the battlefields of Virginia to the beaches 
of Normandy and the liberation of French soil, symbolizes the 
common destiny of our two peoples."

  [Text] Valery Giscard d'Estaing is calling for a "European 
referendum" on the future of political integration. In an 
interview published in yesterday's LES DERNIERES NOUVELLES 
D'ALSACE, the former president of the Republic wonders whether 
it is necessary to have "two currents within the European Union 
[EU]," one which "brings together only those states which 
approve the idea of a political union," and "one which brings 
together the other countries which only want a good organization 
of relations among the twelve European partners." "This 
distinction is important for the future," stated Giscard, who 
suggested that the question be "clearly put," in a referendum, 
"to the public of every member state." "If the referendum turns 
out to be negative in some countries, we would have to draw the 
appropriate conclusions," added Giscard, who, it needs not be 
repeated, sides with those who "approve of political union." In 
addition, the former president of the Republic repeated that he 
remains "very attached to a federalist conception of the EU," 
adding: "And I think that no other solution exists." This 
contradicts Dominique Baudis, the head of the UDF-RPR [French 
Democratic Union-Rally for the Republic] list, who considers the 
federalist conception "outdated."

  [Excerpt] After the Libyan withdrawal from the Aouzou Strip 
in Chad, Colonel al-Qadhdhafi demanded that the French troops 
stationed in Chad leave. He believes that their presence is no 
longer justified. Paris does not agree. Minister Alain 
Lamassoure explained this during the traditional question time 
at the National Assembly: 
  [Begin Lamassoure recording] After this withdrawal, an 
agreement, a treaty of friendship and cooperation was signed by 
Chad and Libya, and we also welcomed this. The French troops 
currently in Chad -- what is called the Epervier operation, 
consisting of 800 men -- are there as a result of an agreement 
made with the Chad Government. That government has not asked 
France to modify its operation. Given that fact and given the 
precariousness of the situation in the country and in the 
region, there are no plans either to modify and certainly not to 
reduce this operation for the moment. [end recording] 
  The French minister for European affairs was answering 
questions this afternoon in place of the foreign minister who is 
currently in Germany. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Pascal Virot: "Socialist Party: Rocard Calls </F>
For `New Alliance'"] 
  [Excerpts] Because his European campaign has been 
foundering, because his Socialist "friends" have been hoping for 
a dismal showing, and because, after all, the 12 June election 
appears to be no more than a warm-up before the presidential 
election, [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard 
called yesterday, in a meeting in Creteil (Val-de-Marne), for "a 
new alliance" between the forces of the Left, "born of a will to 
work together in view of the presidential and municipal 
elections" of 1995. Even though his friends deny any 
similarity, this initiative is strongly reminiscent of one taken 
on 17 February 1993 in Montlouis-sur-Loire, where the former 
prime minister called for a "big bang" of the Left in the 
immediate run-up to a parliamentary election that turned out to 
be disastrous for the PS [Socialist Party]. This time, Michel 
Rocard has drawn up a timetable, with the first major event 
scheduled for 13 June. On that day, he intends to address the 
Communist Party [PC]; the Greens; the friends of Charles 
Fiterman and Philippe Herzog, who are currently marginalized 
within the PC; as well as the "orphans of the Left," so that 
they can tackle "the organizational, electoral, and policy 
initiatives needed to shape the new alliance" and achieve a 
federation of the Left. Is this last-ditch attempt likely to 
turn the tide? Michel Rocard's friends have not concealed that 
since his European campaign took a turn for the worse, he had no 
choice but to "take an initiative." [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Excerpts From Rocard's Creteil Speech </H5>
  The PS leader was in Creteil yesterday evening. Here are a 
few excerpts from the speech he made there. 
  ``We must fight fragmentation and pull together. No less is 
expected from us.... The European campaign will end in a few 
days. We cannot wait to give it a sense of purpose for the 
future.... Ours is the task of forging a `new alliance' for all 
those who want to reform society. I intend to work toward this 
new alliance, born of the will to work together in view of the 
presidential and municipal elections, which will dominate 1995. 
No single party, no single force can hope to achieve that. 
There is a strong connection between the revival of the Left and 
that of the Socialist Party: One cannot happen without the 
other. We Socialists know that our party cannot remain a closed 
shop. What we need is a broad and open movement able to unite 
today's progressive aspirations, those that are being expressed 
from within the various parties of the Left, those of the 
various associations, the demands of women to have their say in 
political life, the concern intellectuals feel at being left out 
and having no other choice than remaining silent or having their 
words distorted by the media. 
  ``Today, being part of a movement that unites all those men 
and women who share the same reform goal must be our common 
ambition. 
  ``As of 13 June, with all those who deem it necessary and 
are 
willing to participate, I shall take the organizational, 
electoral, and policyh initiatives needed to shape this `new 
alliance' that I have been looking for, that we have been 
looking for in the country for months. Provided we are up to 
the task, be assured that our hope for actual solidarity both in 
France and in Europe will be fulfilled.''

<F P=106> [Report signed "G.P.": "Strengthening Franco-German </F>
Industrial Cooperation"] 
  [Text] From bilateral summits to conferences, it is always 
good form to welcome the perspectives of Franco-German 
industrial cooperation. Even so, these perspectives still have 
to be more clearly defined and both sides need to find the means 
of strengthening this cooperation. This was the subject of the 
report drawn up by [former president of Credit National] Paul 
Mentre at the request of Foreign Trade and Industry Minister 
Gerard Longuet and European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure, 
and which should lead to "the making of operational decisions by 
the end of the year." 
  Whether in studies produced by the European Commission in 
Brussels, the French national planning office, or in the German 
study on "Standort Deutschland," [Germany as a Business 
Location] the conclusion is the same: For the last 10 years, 
Europe's export competitiveness has dropped compared with that 
of the United States and newly industrialized countries. Paul 
Mentre's report states: "On the basis of a comparison of wage 
costs in the manufacturing sector, the Commission in Brussels 
noted in 1993 that Europe's competitiveness has fallen globally 
by 5.2 percent, and by 11.4 percent compared with the United 
States." Neither France nor Germany have escaped this trend. 
  Thus, moving straight on to make proposals, Mentre suggested 
three avenues of approach. 
<H5>  Encourage Investment </H5>
  In this area, it is true, we would not be starting from 
scratch. Where the French are concerned, the privatization of 
companies in eastern Germany has given investment opportunities 
to a number of large groups including L'Air Liquide, 
Lafarge-Coppee, Saint-Gobain, and Elf which, in association with 
Thyssen, has bought the Leuna and Zeist refineries. However, we 
need to go further along this road and in particular develop 
cooperation between the major national operators. France 
Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have already established ties (with 
the joint subsidiaries of Eucom and Eurocom in the Atlas 
project), and the report recognizes that they will have the 
opportunity of pushing further in this direction with the 
three-phase privatization of the German operator. Nevertheless, 
the report admits, industrialists think that there are also some 
opportunities left for vertical integration (e.g., Siemens' 
stake in DT [Deutsche Telekom], or Alcatel-Alsthom's 
participation in the capital of France Telecom). 
<H5>  Dynamize Industrial Research </H5>
  In this area, the structures are different and France could 
use German practices as a model. 
  In Germany, applied research is heavily centralized in 
essentially professional institutes favoring the dissemination 
of research, notably to small- and medium-sized companies. The 
shared concerns of both countries should, for example, make it 
possible to create a Franco-German fund for the dissemination of 
industrial research, with independent means gradually rising to 
amount to 1 billion French francs. 
<H5>  Cooperation With Third Countries </H5>
  The idea whereby France and Germany would go into 
partnership 
with the establishment of a consultancy group for privatization 
has fallen through. However, Paul Mentre suggests that this 
same path could be reopened in the direction of certain eastern 
European countries (Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldavia), or in 
specific sectors (energy, transportation, and distribution).

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F>
`g.p.' in Milan; date not given: "Fininvest's Networks Are the 
Worst"] 
  [Text] Milan -- [LA REPUBBLICA] Mr. Bossi, have you heard 
Prime Minister Berlusconi's statement about RAI? 
  [Bossi] Does he want to return to the past? 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Berlusconi says that a situation in which 
the 
public service goes against the government is an anomaly. 
  [Bossi] Taking this bit in isolation, the reasoning is not 
at 
all absurd, but... 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What? 
  [Bossi] But heading the government is someone who already 
has 
three TV networks which daily manipulate people's ideas, second 
by second. It is enough just to look at what they are doing 
right now. In this situation, to give the government RAI would 
be like giving it six TV channels. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] You then like the idea of a public 
television 
which is asked to be attuned to the government? 
  [Bossi] Normally speaking, in a balanced and democratic 
system, whose government does not include one person with three 
TV networks, it makes sense to have a public TV, one which 
supports and emphasizes the government's action. This support 
should not be blind but aimed at the stability of the country, a 
support which does not harm the opposition. The situation in 
Italy is not like this. We have inherited the moral and 
party-dominated decadence of RAI. In addition, we have -- 
something which has never happened before in a civilian or 
noncivilian country -- one person owning three networks and 
being the head of government. What is clear is that, beyond the 
chit-chat, it is Fininvest which is in the line of fire. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] And then? 
  [Bossi] The logical solution is to break the duopoly, that 
of 
RAI and of private TV. But it seems to me that there is no wish 
to change this situation, to achieve a solution rapidly. 
Whatever the declarations are, the problem is to break the 
duopoly. The League has been repeating this for years. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] RAI and Fininvest, which of them functions 
most poorly? 
  [Bossi] RAI, for all the damage it has done, is nothing 
compared with Fininvest's closed and implacable system. 
Berlusconi manipulates his televisions much more than RAI has 
ever done. Where do we put the Fininvest of the last few days? 
Here we would have to sack [media watchdog] Santaniello; one no 
longer understands what game he is playing. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Berlusconi says the RAI problem will be 
placed on the government's agenda, a government which includes 
five League ministers. What will you do? 
  [Bossi] When the time comes, we will see. We will see, don't 
you worry. I repeat that we wish to get out of the duopoly. 
The League voters are not the upper crust, but normal people, 
workers, artisans, small industrialists. For them, no duopoly. 
This is the choice we must make for the good of the country.

<F P=106> [Report by Mario Tedeschini Lalli: "Alarm at Fascism From </F>
Croatia And Slovenia"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- No sooner has one rip in the government's 
international image been repaired than another has appeared. 
The polemic over the statements made by Israel's deputy foreign 
minister and by European Commission President Jacques Delors was 
just beginning to subside when a crisis flared up again, this 
time in the northeast. Slovenia and Croatia have decided to 
join forces against "neofascist claims," and have made a point 
of stating this publicly through their presidents. 
  The two republics have never been on particularly friendly 
terms. As a matter of fact, according to Slovene President Milan 
Kucan, yesterday's meeting with his Croatian counterpart Franjo 
Tudjman in Zagreb was "polemical and very tough." However, 
faced with the "danger from the West," they found it expedient 
to overcome their differences quickly. The more outspoken 
statement came from Croatian President Tudjman, who included 
"Italian neofascist claims on some Slovene and Croatian 
territories" among the reasons making it imperative for Zagreb 
and Ljubljana to "coordinate their policies." Kucan was more 
subdued, but nevertheless adamant: "The disquieting statements 
made by some politicians in Italy" and war in Bosnia require "a 
prompt solution to reciprocal problems." 
  Kucan was obviously referring to National Alliance's [AN] 
presence in the majority government as well as to the request 
put forward by MSI [Italian Social Movement] member Mirko 
Tremaglia (who is now the lower house foreign committee 
chairman) to modify the eastern borders. The new Italian 
Government has always denied having any such intentions, but the 
MSI's statements have underscored Foreign Minister Antonio 
Martino's decision to ask for a conclusion to current 
negotiations on minority rights and the assets of the 1945 
refugees before giving the go-ahead to the two countries' entry 
into the European Union. 
  Tudjman tried to draw a distinction between the government's 
and AN's respective positions by stating that he hoped that the 
government would "continue to pursue previous governments' 
policies based on democracy and friendly relations." However, 
he added that "we cannot ignore certain voices in Italy that are 
making an open apology for fascism and its imperialist policies." 
  In short, AN and the positions put forward by some of the 
latter's members are beginning to weigh heavily on the 
government's foreign policy and leaving its flank exposed to 
criticism from such characters as Tudjman who, for some time 
now, have been riding the wave of nationalist feeling in their 
own countries. As a result, living conditions for Italians in 
Istria--now divided between Slovenia and Croatia--may become 
worse in the short term. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by former Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa: "Put </F>
a Stop to Italian Debt-Making"] 
  [Text] The recession in the Italian economy touched bottom 
around the third quarter of last year. Since then, we have 
begun to see signs of a recovery, strengthening in the first 
months of 1994. In the fourth quarter of 1993, GDP rose. Since 
December, household confidence has improved uninterruptedly and 
employment expectations have reversed. Again, since the fourth 
quarter of 1993, industry's confidence, recorded by the ISCO 
[National Institute for the Study of the Economic Situation]- 
MONDO ECONOMICO surveys, has improved. The balance on 
short-term order and production trends has turned positive and 
is increasing. Industrial sales and the retail sales index are 
rising. Capacity utilization levels remain low but are improving. 
  Since February, on the other hand, the downward trend in 
medium- and long-term interest rates has first stopped and then 
reversed. In 1993 this trend permitted a 4.7 percent reduction 
in the yield-to-maturity of 10-year treasury bonds and a halving 
of the yield differential with corresponding German paper. 
Foreign holders have sold, at times substantially, prices have 
fallen, and yields have risen. 
  Obviously it would be out of place to establish any 
connection between the observed events, whether favorable, such 
as the end of the recession, or unfavorable, such as the rise in 
interest rates, and the arrival of a new government. There is 
no need for "sensations" or for "surveys not covering the whole 
country" in order to obtain "signs of a recovery which has 
already begun." An ample mass of data and commentaries from 
official and private sources demonstrate that the turning point, 
as we have seen, lay between the end of 1993 and the beginning 
of 1994, well before "confidence and enthusiasm" had any 
opportunity (or reason) to show themselves. As for interest 
rates, the increase has come since March, in other major 
countries just as in Italy. 
  The "good fortune of having inherited an economy which was 
strongly improving" (according to the Goldman Sachs analysts), 
on the one hand, and the reversal of the downward trend in 
interest rates, on the other, compose a framework which both 
offers opportunities and presents problems. 
  In the Bank of Italy report we find that, in 1993, "the 
Italian economy has achieved results, not only in reducing the 
government deficit, but also in rebalancing its foreign 
accounts, starting a restructuring of the services sector, 
recovering profit margins, and containing inflation which are 
unprecedented taking into account the unfavorable economic 
climate." Certain of these results are solid; others need to be 
consolidated or improved. 
  Last year, the process of bringing public financing back 
into 
balance was hindered by the recession and facilitated by the 
reduction in interest rates. The structural adjustments 
achieved by the 1992 and 1993 budgets, leaving aside interest 
charges, were imposing (as can be seen by comparing the trend 
forecasts calculated by the Treasury Ministry for the coming 
years before and after the interventions), but fell short of the 
objectives, despite the supplementary measures adopted during 
1993. The recession's effects, in terms of lower income and 
higher expenditures, have been felt and continue into 1994. On 
the other hand, thanks to the reduction in interest rates 
(promoted by a shrewd debt management policy), interest 
expenditure was some 20 trillion lire lower than forecast in 
1993 and will be some 30 trillion lower in 1994. More 
precisely, the average cost of state indebtedness, which went 
above 11 percent in 1992 and was a little lower in 1993, should 
be scarcely more than 9 percent in 1994. 
  Adding to this an excess of tax income over expenditure, 
apart from interests, a reduction in the average cost of 
indebtedness represents an essential ingredient in restoring the 
financial situation. It serves to reduce the current deficit. 
In particular it alleviates the budget correction (on 
expenditure and/or income) necessary to stop the growth in the 
debt to national product ratio. The "cost" of attaining this 
objective by 1996, in terms of cuts in expenditure or increased 
income, diminishes by some 22 trillion lire for every one 
percentage point reduction in the average cost of the debt. 
  But can we be certain that the reduction in the cost of the 
debt will continue? Unfortunately not, because the achievable 
level for the year will turn out roughly equal to today's cost 
of medium- and long-term borrowing. Let us say straightaway 
that monetary policy is unable to influence long-term interest 
rates, as international experience has taught us. Or rather, a 
lax monetary policy, which arouses expectations of inflation, 
far from reducing them, will run the risk of increasing them. 
Should we therefore resign ourselves, and place our confidence 
solely in the development of external rates on the international 
markets, which is not favorable today? Not necessarily, because 
Italian yields still have some way to go on their own. 
  The yield differential between long-term Italian securities 
and similar German or French paper, even if it has halved 
compared with the beginning of 1993, still remains three points 
or a little less. This is due in small part to the "country 
risk," due in part to expectations regarding inflation, and in 
particular to the size of the debt and the continuing 
uncertainty on the budget adjustment. This is a differential 
which can be reduced, if the adjustment policy is incisive and 
is perceived as such by the markets. But it can also increase 
the other way, and even more if the purse strings are opened 
wider, with the idea of financing lower income today with the 
hope of higher income tomorrow. In the first case, the course 
of Italian rates could become in part untied from that of 
international rates, making use of a margin for further descent; 
in the second case, a reduction in international rates would not 
provide us with any relief, and the negative effect of their 
increase would be heightened. 
  There are good reasons which should induce us to continue, 
unhesitatingly, on the first path. An economy which is out of 
recession, in which the impetus of exports promoted by the 
undervalued exchange rate is now consolidated by the European 
recovery, not only has no need of fiscal incentives, but makes a 
further decisive step toward budget adjustment easier and more 
bearable. Today, the average cost of the debt is still lower 
than that forecast last July in the economic and financial 
programming document. As a result, the necessary 1995 and 1996 
correction has decreased compared with what was then estimated. 
Decisive intervention in 1995 could further reduce it, 
permitting and supporting a reduction in rates. 
  In the final years of the past decade, we had ideal 
conditions for arresting the growth of the debt in terms of the 
domestic product. This chance was squandered, and the cost of 
adjustment rose, leaving it to begin in much more difficult 
years. Another opportunity, even if less favorable than the 
previous one, appears to be on the horizon today. We need to 
seize it. It could be the last one.

    [Editorial Report] The Portuguese press reported the 
results of polls focusing on the next presidential elections, 
the 12 June European Parliament elections, and political 
leaders' popularity. 
  The results of a VISAO/Marktest poll conducted between 26 
March and 23 April among 994 residents of the Greater Lisbon and 
Greater Porto areas, 18-64 years old, appeared in the 26 May 
issue of the Lisbon weekly VISAO. The poll had a margin of error 
of plus or minus 4.1 percent. Respondents were asked to express 
their preference for president of the Republic. Former President 
Ramalho Eanes ran ahead of his potential competitors with 14.6 
percent. He was followed by Prime Minister Cavaco Silva with 
10.1 percent, Socialist Party (PS) official and Lisbon Mayor 
Jorge Sampaio with 8.9 percent, and PS leader Antonio Guterres 
with 3.1 percent. "Other candidates" received 15.2 percent, 
"none of the above" was chosen by 7.6 percent and a large 
majority (40.4 percent) did not know or did not answer. 
  The results of an EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao poll conducted 
nationwide among 1,051 individuals between 11 and 18 May, with a 
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent, appeared in the 21 
May Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO. In this poll the PS, with 39.4 
percent, led other parties by a wide margin for the 
Euroelections. The governing Social Democratic Party (PSD) 
obtained 26.2 percent, the Unified Democratic Coalition (CDU) 
9.0 percent, and the Center Social Democratic Party-Popular 
Party (CDS-PP) 7.4 percent. The undecided vote was 10.8 percent. 
Following the PS's victory in the December 1993 municipal 
elections, this party is now in a favorable position to run in 
next year's parliamentary elections, the EXPRESSO article 
contended. 
  The popularity of political leaders was measured by the 
Marktest organization in a telephone poll of 800 individuals 
18-64 yeara of age residing in the Greater Lisbon and Greater 
Porto areas. Poll results appeared in the 19 May VISAO. 
President Mario Soares led the list with 64.1 percent, followed 
by Cavaco Silva with 37.5 percent, Antonio Guterres with 33.8 
percent, the CDU's Carlos Carvalhas with 22.3 percent, and the 
CDS's Manuel Monteiro with 39.7 percent. In the same poll, 1,398 
individuals between 18 and 64 were asked to rank their 
preference for the next legislative elections. The PS again led 
the list with 43 percent, followed by the PSD with 27.9 percent, 
the CDS-PP with 14.0 percent, and the CDU with 8.00 percent. 
"Other parties" received 1.3 percent, blank ballots amounted to 
5.2 percent, 8.2 percent of the respondents said they would not 
vote, and 29.1 percent did not know or did not answer.

    [Editorial Report] There are two large groups in the 
governing Social Democratic Party (PSD), wrote Fernanda 
Mestrinho in the 28 May Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO, and they 
revolve around Minister of Defense Fernando Nogueira and 
Minister of Internal Administration Dias Loureiro. While the 
latter exerted tight control over the party during his tenure as 
PSD secretary general, Nogueira has been able to create his own 
"enormous network of dependencies," which could nevertheless 
change as soon as this "retinue" would "no longer be fed." At 
the ideological level, Dias Loureiro embodies liberal, free 
market principles, while Nogueira represents social democracy. 
Between the two stand the technocrats, who carefully remain 
equidistant from both and tabulate the losses in the conflict. 
According to Mestrinho, Dias Loureiro has dropped out of the 
race to succeed Prime Minister Cavaco Silva, for he knows that 
the next PSD leader will be only "transitory" and prefers to 
wait. While he holds "strong" trump cards in his attempt to 
prevent Nogueira's rise, he is beginning to pay more attention 
to "cold and calculating" Minister of Foreign Affairs Durao 
Barroso, whose career in achieving his high position has been 
"autonomous," Mestrinho asserted. According to the results of a 
May Catholic University/O INDEPENDENTE poll (no further details) 
published in the 20 May Lisbon weekly O INDEPENDENTE, Durao 
Barroso is the most popular minister in the Cavaco Silva 
government. 
  For his part, Nogueira is aware that despite his ability to 
secure the succession to Cavaco Silva, he can only do so by 
remaining in the government, and will never be able to claim, as 
Cavaco Silva has, that "I am the party," Mestrinho asserted. His 
ascension will depend on negotiations with other PSD "barons" 
eager for action after years of "forced domestication." 
  Mestrinho then commented on other possible successors to 
Cavaco Silva. Former Prime Minister Francisco Pinto Balsemao is 
one, but he is only interested in the presidency, and thus 
depends on Cavaco Silva. Rui Machete is another; however, he was 
already PS leader in the past, and "criminals never return to 
the scene of the crime." Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Joao 
de Deus Pinheiro, now a European Union (EU) commissioner, is 
often mentioned because of his openness to dialogue and the 
ability to negotiate with the various party factions. Two other 
names to remember, Mestrinho added, are Minister of Public Works 
Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, a key member of the government with 
high visibility because of the large-scale building of roads and 
bridges, and former Minister of Agriculture Cardoso e Cunha, a 
member of the PSD national political commission now in charge of 
Expo-98, a project that will bring changes to half of Lisbon.

    [Editorial Report] There are no ideological differences 
within the Socialist Party (PS), wrote Orlando Raimundo in the 
21 May Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, but only different roads to 
power. The "saga" of the PS, which has already "sacrificed" two 
secretaries general--Vitor Constancio and Jorge Sampaio--is 
permanently marked by a lack of faith in the leader, Raimundo 
continued, fomented by a president [Mario Soares] who "insists 
that everything be done his way." Besides his own--mostly 
young--allies, PS leader Antonio Guterres seems to have only 
poll results on his side. Were Guterres to lose the 12 June 
European Parliament elections, hostilities would immediately 
begin, centering on how to bring about Prime Minister Cavaco 
Silva's downfall, the socialists' "great obsession" in recent 
years, Raimundo contended. However, if the PS wins, victory 
would be "devalued" and Guterres would only get, once again, 
"the benefit of the doubt." Meanwhile, Raimundo continued, 
various party officials are waiting in the background to decide 
about reentering the scene. 
  According to Raimundo, the PS's "hard core" is formed by 
Guterres partisans who throw themselves wholeheartedly in the 
struggle to prove the validity of their strategy, which aims at 
removing the PS's leftist stigma and waiting for disillusioned 
"Cavacoists" to join them. Their rallying point is the clash 
with President Soares. The group includes Antonio Vitorino, who 
heads the PS list for the Euroelections, Jorge Coelho, Jose 
Lamego, Arons de Carvalho, and Jorge Lacao. 
  The group around former Minister of Defense Jaime Gama 
includes Eduardo Pereira, Jose Lello, and Miranda Calha. Absent 
in recent years from the political debate because of their 
leader's "desertion," they are attempting a comeback by 
supporting Gama as an alternative to Guterres. While Gama seems 
to be a "born loser," he still wields a measure of influence, 
according to Raimundo. 
  The Sampaio group--Joao Cravinho, Alberto Martins, Antonio 
Costa, Lopes Cardoso, and Ferro Rodrigues--aims at ensuring 
Sampaio's candidacy for the presidency and reunifying the Left. 
Like President Soares, they want internal diversity and a 
plurality of opinions. 
  Betting on the values of humanism and of the Left, the 
Soares 
group, formed by Almeida Santos, Manuel Alegre, and Antonio 
Campos "cannot reconcile itself with the `tragedy' of a country 
governed by the Right," but lacks a strategy and an alternative 
to Guterres. 
  Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes "runs on his own track," keeps 
intact his presidential ambitions, and is best placed to succeed 
Guterres, according to Raimundo, despite his trumpeted 
solidarity with the PS leader. 
  The "free" group, which includes PS official Joao Soares, 
former General Workers Union (UGT) leader Torres Couto, and PS 
luminary Vitor Constancio, is awaiting electoral results to 
decide its future course.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Vegar: "F-16: United States Dictates Rules </F>
of the Deal to Portugal"] 
  [Text] The Portuguese Government did not have any 
money, and it wanted 20 F-16 fighter planes. The United States 
gave it the money and dictated the rules. Then the United States 
lent the money and took over the game. Finally, Fernando 
Nogueira is asking for counterpart deals, but the manufacturer 
is holding all the trump cards. The game is almost over, and the 
government is losing. 
  The 20 F-16 fighters are vital to the defense and 
sovereignty 
of Portugal. As one Portuguese Air Force general lucidly 
explained, "those aircraft are an attribute of sovereignty in 
peacetime, in times of crisis, and in wartime. The simple reason 
is that it is essential that Portugal know who is using its 
airspace, that it have the means to deny access to that airspace 
if it wants to, and, mainly, that all countries know that it is 
capable of denying entry into our airspace." 
  In the name of that attribute of sovereignty, Portugal is 
standing by with eyes on the ground and letting the United 
States dictate all the rules of a two-way deal--with immediate 
financial and industrial harm, elimination of its own will, and 
abandonment of its original objectives as the result--and now it 
is doing the same with Lockheed, the firm that manufactures the 
aircraft. And all because of a powerful lack of political clout, 
according to what is being whispered in Lisbon and said aloud in 
Washington, D.C. 
  The deal began in August 1990 with the signing of the 
contract between Portugal, represented by the Ministry of 
Defense; the United States, represented by the USAF (U.S. Air 
Force); and the manufacturer, General Dynamics (which Lockheed 
bought in 1992). Quantity: 20 aircraft. Type: F-16A, Block 15 
(the most advanced version of type A), all brand-new. Price: 
$400 million (60 million contos). 
  Source of the money: the U.S. Administration. The fact that 
Portugal does not have 60 million contos with which to buy the 
F-16's has been a crucial issue throughout the deal. First of 
all, because the Portuguese Government was required to buy the 
aircraft from a U.S. manufacturer. Second, because the money was 
to be delivered over four consecutive fiscal years (1990 to 
1994) in exchange for American use of the Lajes Base in the 
Azores. The only problem is that when it comes to business, the 
Americans put their own interests in first, second, and third 
place. The United States regarded the money as foreign aid being 
granted to Portugal, not as payment for the use of Lajes. In 
other words, the Portuguese Government did not insist on 
acceptance of its argument that it was receiving the money in 
exchange for something of value to the United States. The 
Americans prevailed with the idea that they were helping 
Portugal. A lot. 
  The result was that Portugal never even considered demanding 
counterpart deals from Lockheed totaling the value of the 
purchase, although that is common practice in deals of this kind. 
  The main argument in defense of that stand by the Portuguese 
Ministry of Defense is that U.S. law forbids the negotiation of 
counterpart deals when U.S. money being used for the purchase. 
But that is not true. Actually, Clinton said--in a statement 
made in April 1990 under the title "Policy on Counterpart Deals 
for Exports of Military Materiel"--that "no department of the 
U.S. Government must be directly involved or involve U.S. firms 
in counterpart agreements related to the sale of military 
materiel. The U.S. Administration's money must not be used to 
finance counterpart deals in transactions involving defense 
materiel." 
  Fine. The only thing is that in that same statement in which 
he defends the interests of U.S. firms--as is proper for him to 
do--President Clinton is clear to the point of saying that "the 
decision to become involved in counterpart deals and the 
responsibility for negotiating and implementing counterpart 
contracts belongs to the companies involved." Because, 
"recognizing the commercial reality of those contracts in a free 
market, the President's policy does not restrict the negotiating 
rights of U.S. industry when it comes to establishing 
counterpart contracts with foreign purchasers of U.S. goods and 
services." 
  The only possible conclusion then, and the one painfully 
drawn by Portuguese officials, "is that Portugal lacks the 
political clout to impose counterpart deals in the value of $400 
million. The United States would not agree, and it would cut off 
the financing." 
  At the very start of the deal, the Portuguese Government 
chose to sign a contract with the U.S. Administration rather 
than sign one with Lockheed directly. That choice has had 
positive and negative consequences. 
  The department in charge of the sale was the FMS (Foreign 
Military Sales), an agency of the USAF. 
  The reason for that choice, according to what SEMANARIO was 
told by a Portuguese officer involved in the acquisition, "is 
that the FMS handles all sales and hires all the subcontractors 
under a single contract. If we tried to do that ourselves, we 
would have to negotiate and sign some 40 contracts, with all the 
resulting delays and problems." Obviously, the FMS collects a 
small percentage for its services: in this case, 3 percent of 
the value of the sale. 
  At the same time, the FMS operates as a system for 
consolidating orders, meaning that it sends the manufacturer 
several requisitions under a single "package," a procedure that 
theoretically results in lower costs. Portugal was included in 
the same "package" as Pakistan and the U.S. Air Force itself. A 
few months ago, however, a minor "windstorm" blew that order 
down. The United States reduced the size of its order, and for 
political reasons, Congress placed an embargo on the sale of 
F-16's to Pakistan. Even though it renegotiated and obtained a 
reduction in the cost of some items such as spare parts, 
Portugal found the price of its aircraft rising by a hefty 
600,000 contos. 
<H5>  Best of the Cheapest </H5>
  But on the other hand, choosing the FMS brought Portugal a 
few advantages, specifically in the type of F-16 chosen. These 
fighter planes are divided into Type A (up to Block 15) and Type 
C (up to Block 50). The C's, which are more advanced 
technologically, came about because of a stated need by the U.S. 
Air Force to design for itself a fighter with improved ground 
attack capability. The C's have more powerful engines and more 
weaponry. Portugal ended up with the most advanced model of the 
F-16A--the so-called Block 15--because it is cheaper but mainly 
because Portugal was able to be included in the EPG (European 
Group, comprising Belgium, Denmark, Norway, and Holland, which 
have F-16's), which is going to design a Middle-Life Upgrading 
(MLU) program by 1996. That program will make the F-16A's 
technologically equal to the F-16C Block 50's (the current 
state-of-the-art version of the F-16), which Greece and Turkey 
recently acquired. 
  Procurement through the FMS also had another benefit for 
Portugal. In an effort to cooperate in keeping the price under 
$400 million, the Americans made a present of the Pratt &amp; 
Whitney engines. Those engines had come from secondhand F-16's, 
but they were overhauled and updated on the USAF's assembly 
lines along with others for the USAF itself and ended up as 
top-of-the-line engines: F100-PW-220E's, the jewel in Pratt &amp; 
Whitney's crown. "The best guarantee of quality that we could 
have," said someone who has kept tabs on the process. 
  In November 1992, a figurative bomb exploded on the eighth 
floor of the Ministry of Defense, which is where Fernando 
Nogueira has his office. Because Congress had reduced the 
defense budget by $267 billion, the United States was 
eliminating the military equipment funds being given to Portugal 
annually. Three months later, an envoy from the Pentagon visited 
Lisbon with a solution in his briefcase: the United States would 
lend Portugal the shortfall at 5 percent interest. The 
alternative for Portugal was to cancel the purchase or find 
other financing. The Portuguese Government made a halfhearted 
protest, alleging that the U.S. Administration had not fought 
hard enough with Congress, but the noise it made was not very 
loud. And Cavaco Silva and Fernando Nogueira even accepted the 
loan. The outcome of a vital purchase: $225 million given by the 
United States and $90 million granted as a loan in 1993 at 5 
percent interest. In 1994 there was another surprise. The 
remaining $81 million would be lent to us, but at 6.17 percent 
interest. Again, Portugal accepted. 
  However, with $170 million of its own money (40 percent of 
the total purchase) involved, Portugal finally decided to demand 
counterpart deals from Lockheed. In the course of 1993, the 
Secretariat of State for Defense Technologies (SEETD), headed by 
Eugenio Ramos, sent the manufacturer several letters asking it 
to negotiate the matter. The only sound heard from Texas, where 
Lockheed's offices are located, was the wind whistling across 
the prairie. Until November, that is, when the SEETD--in an 
action agreed on with Cavaco Silva's office and the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs--sent a tough letter warning Lockheed that 
Portugal would cancel the program if negotiations on counterpart 
deals were not started. 
<H5>  Lockheed Offers Very Little </H5>
  It did not take the Americans long to cross the Atlantic, 
but 
the first meeting was not held until a week after Eugenio 
Ramos--who had been directly in charge of the matter--had 
resigned his post. 
  Obviously aiming low, Lockheed put $18 million on the table. 
Its proposal was rejected by the Portuguese. First of all 
because, as is true in any deal of this kind, they were entitled 
to demand 100 percent of the purchase value in counterpart 
deals. Second, because a cabinet decision approved in 1987 
requires that very thing. Inexplicably, however, Fernando 
Nogueira went to Texas in February to accept the first two 
aircraft. As an adviser involved in the deal says, "Portugal 
weakened its negotiating position by accepting the aircraft. It 
should not have done so until all the negotiations were 
concluded." Lockheed had stated at a meeting in January that it 
would not go beyond $42 million worth of counterpart deals, as 
SEMANARIO reported exclusively in March. 
  For its part, Portugal wants $90 million. Oddly, the 
argument 
used by the Ministry of Defense is that that is the amount being 
received by Lockheed. But that is not true. What is really 
happening is that Lockheed has hired a number of 
subcontractors--several dozen of them--as is usually the case 
when "complex machines" such as the F-16 are being manufactured. 
To mention just the main ones, Westinghouse is supplying the 
radar, McDonnell Douglas the injection system, Linton the laser, 
General Electric the cannon, and the TEC the video system, while 
the EPG is supplying 20 components of the aircraft structure 
itself. However, Lockheed is responsible for hiring those 
subcontractors and sharing the profits, so Portugal is fully 
justified in demanding counterpart deals corresponding to the 
sales amount that will be collected by the prime manufacturer. 
SEMANARIO has learned exactly how the cake will be divided up: 
$240 million for Lockheed and $160 million for the FMS. 
  By using Lockheed's isolated share of the profits as its 
reference point, the Portuguese Government is unquestionably 
lowering its own stake. In terms of Lockheed's $240 million and 
in terms of the $171 million that Portugal will have to pay out. 
And as experts involved in the negotiations unhesitatingly 
admit, "between the $42 million being offered by Lockheed and 
the $90 million being demanded by the Portuguese, the 
negotiations are going to lead to some figure in between, as is 
natural." The difference adds up to quite a few million dollars 
that a weak industry cannot afford to throw away. 
<H5>  Counterpart Deals Are Essential </H5>
  When complex equipment as marketable as the F-16 is being 
acquired, counterpart deals are absolutely essential to the 
purchaser. The main counterpart deals in this case involve 
technology transfer, future subcontracts for Portuguese firms 
enabling them to manufacture and repair aircraft components, and 
the purchase of goods and services in Portugal. A memorandum 
presented by Lockheed and based on the $42 million being 
proposed by that firm--it will soon be discussed in Lisbon at 
the same time that the negotiations are being concluded--names 
the Portuguese Air Force, the EID [expansion not given], 
Edisoft, and TAP [Portuguese Airways] as the main beneficiaries 
of the counterpart deals. 
  There is no doubt that Portugal needs the F-16's. There is 
no 
doubt that it ought to have conducted the negotiations 
differently from the start. A clearheaded Portuguese general 
puts it all very clearly: "We should have come up with the money 
ourselves. We could have said what we wanted and gotten all the 
manufacturers to do what they promised. We could have chosen the 
best." Exactly.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has sent a letter to UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali stating that the Turkish 
Cypriot side has the will to conclude an agreement on the 
confidence-building measures issue. Denktas also requested 
including developments that occurred after 30 May. 
  According to information obtained by the ANATOLIA AGENCY, 
Denktas pointed out in his letter that he has shown flexibility 
on the issues concerning access to Maras [Varosha] as well as 
the map submitted by the United Nations; he added, however, that 
these positive developments were not conveyed in Butrus-Ghali's 
Cyprus report. 
  In his letter Denktas noted: I have inspected the report 
regarding your mission of goodwill and I will communicate to you 
my assessment on this subject at a suitable time. Despite the 
items in the report which are unacceptable and detrimental to 
the Turkish Cypriot side, however, we are not in favor of 
stopping the negotiation process on the confidence-building 
measures. 
  Stating that these views were already conveyed to Gustave 
Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special 
representative to Cyprus, Denktas pointed out that the Turkish 
Cypriot side had made its position on access to Maras quite 
clear. 
  Recalling that the UN secretary general's report does not 
reflect developments which occurred after 30 May, Denktas 
requested that an addition to the report to include these 
developments.

  [Excerpt] President Rauf Denktas has called on the Greek 
Cypriot side for mutual disarmament, stressing that this is the 
wish and will of the Turkish side. Denktas inaugurated the 
central siren system established by the Civil Defense 
Organization. 
  In a speech which was broadcast through the siren system he 
inaugurated today, Denktas called for mutual disarmament. 
Denktas said: Come let us sign a disarmament agreement and let 
our people be comfortable. Let us be good neighbors and let 
these good neighborly relations lead to peace. This is our wish 
and will. Armament is of no help to anybody and only instigates 
enmity. Within this awareness, I repeat my call for peace on 
this historical day, for signing an agreement on condition that 
the flag of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is not 
lowered from its flag-post. Indicating that the whole world 
knows the Turkish side's feelings concerning this issue, Denktas 
added that he wanted the Greek Cypriots to be aware of the 
Turkish side's sentiments as well.

  [Text] It is not difficult for one to realize that the 
United States and Britain encourage the new Turkish maneuver to 
block the promotion of new, more effective, processes on the 
Cyprus issue. A plan to amend Butrus-Ghali's report to the UN 
Security Council supposedly to include Denktas' intentions is 
already under way in New York. It is obvious that this attempt 
aims at changing the climate that has been created following the 
points made in the Butrus-Ghali report regarding Turkish 
intransigence. 
  Once again, the United States and Britain rush to support 
the 
Turkish side. Once again, the United States and Britain attempt 
to prevent developments which are not satisfactory to Ankara and 
Denktas. Again and again, the United States and Britain render 
useless, or at least attempt to render useless, every 
possibility to steer the Cyprus issue onto the right course. It 
is natural that these attempts concern us and we should deal 
with them in a decisive and vigorous manner, because we do not 
have the margin to be dragged into a process which derails the 
Cyprus issue even further from its correct direction and 
framework.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou sees a simple 
decrease in the ever-increasing number of Turkish provocations 
behind tonight's appeasement attempt by Ankara following the 
strong reaction caused by Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's 
statement. Replying to correspondents' questions this evening at 
the Astir Hotel in Vouliagmeni, Prime Minister Papandreou also 
referred to other current issues. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Roula Kambouryiani] Prime 
Minister Papandreou sees an increase in the Turkish 
provocations, despite the attempts by Turkish Foreign Minister 
Hikmet Cetin and Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to calm the 
situation. Papandreou talked about an attempt by Turkey to 
create an artificial tension that is dangerous. 
  [Papandreou] As you know, a short while ago Cetin said there 
was no such meaning in Ciller's statement, and what appeared 
momentarily as an artificial tension with an unknown aim has 
been relieved somewhat, which we welcome. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you expect Turkish 
provocations to increase following the Kurdish issue? 
  [Papandreou] There is already an increase. There has been a 
small drop off in that increase of tension, because Demirel also 
made a statement referring to President Konstandinos Karamanlis, 
saying that they signed agreements together. This is an attempt 
to tone down their rhetoric. We hope that this continues, 
because all these problems are artificial and, of course, 
dangerous. 
  [Correspondent] The issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] is at a new round of negotiations. 
Next week Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will meet Cyrus 
Vance. What do you expect? 
  [Papandreou] What do I expect? I do not know. We hope that 
this issue ends quickly. [FYROM President Kiro] Gligirov thinks 
it will take time. We will see. Nothing is assumed. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by G. Lakopoulos: "Intelligence Service Factions"] </F>
  [Text] For the past several months, a storm has been 
brewing on the top floors of the Katekhakis Street skyscraper 
which houses the offices of the National Intelligence Service 
[EIP]. The internecine conflict, whose outcome to date remains 
undecided, has escalated thanks to the actions of a group of 
Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK] party members who hold 
official trade union status within EIP. Critical of their 
director, they are demanding certain changes in the structure 
and administration of the Service. The administration in turn 
believes its critics' motives to be "largely self-serving and 
vengeful." Service director Admiral Leonidhas Vasilikopoulos, 
an officer with a brilliant career and a democratic past, is in 
the eye of the storm and is observing in-house developments with 
composure, and waiting for the waters to calm before giving in 
to a counteroffensive trade. 
  Nevertheless, things are extremely serious. The trade 
unionists who are criticizing the administration are members of 
PASOK--some even participated in party congresses. In this 
capacity, they sent two letters to the executive bureau on 14 
January 1994 and 14 February 1994, seeking the removal of the 
director. This was after the bridges between them had already 
been severed. 
  Mr. Vasilikopoulos' reaction, though discreet, matched their 
own style of operations: Being himself a member of the PASOK 
Central Committee at the time, he addressed himself to the same 
executive bureau in his vested capacity and, in the name of the 
party, asked them to resume their duties. 
  At the next congress, the trade unionists were ready for 
him: 
they lobbied energetically to prevent his reelection. He got 346 
votes and came in 190th. This "victory" was celebrated 
appropriately, yet the admiral does not seem to mind. What 
exactly is going on? 
<H5>  Tempest in Intelligence Sanctum </H5>
  The situation which has developed within EIP can be 
characterized as explosive and dangerous. In a service sensitive 
about its bad past, this escalating power struggle takes on at 
times the form of an "unorthodox war" which threatens to reveal 
to the public information--whether true or not--that could 
damage even the service activities of EIP. Threats and 
accusations are flying about, unsigned denunciations are 
circulating, and personages known as "Anonymous" threaten old 
EIP members with public disclosures. Throughout the mess, in 
this atmosphere of reciprocal mistrust and blackmail, party 
factionalism is rising rapidly, while "democrats" vs. "junta 
supporters" and "greens" vs. "the Gryllakis people" coexist in a 
silent balance of terror. 
<H5>  Incriminating Dialogue </H5>
  The trade unionists are asking for a "dialogue" and claim 
that they already have the plan for the "democratization of 
EIP." The administration counters that this "is not a matter of 
trade unionism, but of party members who wish to control a 
service which can no longer be influenced by political 
parties--as was the case in the past." Serious insinuations hide 
behind such declarations from the two sides. The trade unionists 
are threatening to release "documents" detrimental to the 
director, since they will prove that he "is collaborating with 
people who were in power in the past." In a flyer signed by the 
"Coordinating Committee" of the "Democratic Cooperation" one 
finds the following statement: "Our national conscience obliges 
us at present to keep our silence." The administration, on the 
other hand, insists: "Even if Admiral Vasilikopoulos does belong 
to PASOK, his very record does not allow him to repeat within 
EIP what occurred in the past, and especially during that period 
between 1981 and 1989, that nobody can be proud of." The trade 
unionists reply that "The director has not honored the 
preelection promise he made at a public rally, namely, to lend 
his support to those who had been ousted previously." To this, 
Mr. Vasilikopoulos' aides reply that "the fact that he 
participated in a public rally in his capacity as a PASOK 
official cannot be used to hinder the director of the EIP from 
performing his duties." And the mess goes on. 
  The government, for the time being, is following these 
events 
with some embarrassment. Minister to the Prime Minister Mr An. 
Peponis, nominally in charge of EIP, is avoiding any 
involvement, knowing that Mr. Vasilikopoulos enjoys the full 
trust of the prime minister. Nevertheless, the trade unionists 
claim that they have been assured by departing PASOK members of 
the executive bureau that the director will be replaced or, at 
the very least, that their own demands will be accepted. When 
Mr. Vasilikopoulos was informed of this--what kind of EIP 
director would he be, had he not been?--he redefined the dispute 
on a different basis: "Either you hold them back, or I'm getting 
the hell out of here." Nevertheless, a few individuals are 
trying to negotiate a compromise which will achieve a 
frictionless coexistence between the director and the party 
members, and eliminate the danger of having the dispute escalate 
to the point that it would end up making public "documents" that 
would hurt not only EIP but also the government. Already, 
certain "papers" are circulating, which one side considers to be 
"hot," while the other side thinks they are "counterfeit and 
created for base purposes." What is their content? Terrorism, 
which seems to be the "favorite game" of some EIP members, even 
though legally EIP has no authority to play it. 
  From a certain point of view, all this is the result of a 
peculiar kind of trade unionism that has been developing over 
the past several years in EIP--a work place where, 
significantly, the workers cannot even reveal their occupation. 
<H5>  Retirees and Career Officers </H5>
  In the beginning of the 1980's, the New Democracy [ND] tried 
to "govern EIP from the outside," through a staff of retired 
officers formed by the party to control--perhaps even more 
decisively than the regular administration would have done--many 
officers of the service. After 1989, PASOK countered this effort 
by encouraging trade unionist activities within EIP. The ND has 
already paid the price for its decision. PASOK is in danger of 
doing so. The "retirees" of the one faction and the "trade 
unionists" of the other are tending to develop into 
complementary forces. How things develop during the present 
period will be critical for the future. At the moment, the only 
winners are the faceless and impersonal mechanisms of EIP, which 
are often made to serve very opaque interests. In intelligence 
work, the question what is "democratic" and what not often does 
not have an easy answer. 
<H5>  [Box, p A39] </H5>
<H5>  Power Play </H5>
  A certain theory says: "If you want to turn out good 
pursuers, pick them from among the most pursued." The power 
struggle that is going on at present in EIP is violating all the 
rules of service operation. PASOK officials are asking to be 
"vindicated" and wish to have their "persecutors" removed from 
office. The director of EIP is sufficiently wise and experienced 
to realize that playing with fire in this situation is 
dangerous. Before he intervenes, he prefers to get to know in 
depth the service in his trust and take stock of his own 
strengths. On the other side, the trade unionists and party 
officials appear to be in a hurry and demand "changes here and 
now." The rift between them was unavoidable and was bound to 
take on the characteristics that dovetail perfectly with the 
specificities of the service itself. On Katekhakis Street there 
is only one modus operandi. And so the theory is 
confirmed: "If you want to turn out good pursuers, pick them 
from among the most pursued."

  [Text] Prosperity Party [PP] leader Necmettin Erbakan has 
said that the real aim of Poised Hammer is to divide Turkey. 
Its mandate should not be extended again, he said. 
  Addressing a PP assembly group meeting, Erbakan alleged that 
it has been documented that Poised Hammer extends food and 
medical aid to the separatist terrorist organization PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan]. 
  Erbakan also said that it is wrong to extend the state of 
emergency, which has been in effect for so long, by another four 
months. 
  [Begin Erbakan recording] We want every kind of freedom to 
reign in every part of our country. We hold our country's unity 
and integrity above all else. While upholding our country's 
unity and integrity, however, we want the rules to be the same 
throughout the country. [end recording] 
  Erbakan charged that constitutional amendments are the 
business of the parliament not of the government. He welcomed 
the decision to set up an interparty committee to prepare the 
constitutional amendments.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has announced that 
exports rose by 13 percent during the last month and, that for 
the first time in many years, exports and imports reached the 
same level. She also announced that as of this month, monthly 
credits of $250 million will be extended for exports. Within 
this framework, she said, credits of $61 million have been 
extended during the past six days. 
  The prime minister said: All the action is in exports. If 
you export, you emerge from this situation. 
  Ciller pointed out that everything is working as planned, 
stage by stage. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] I can say easily today that the 
current transactions deficit which stood somewhere between $6 
billion and $7 billion will be zero at the end of the year, in 
six months time. This is an extremely great success, to be able 
to eliminate totally one of two deficits, a foreign deficit, so 
quickly, in six months. We are receiving the first signs at the 
levels we estimated. [end recording] 
  Ciller stressed that the economic struggle will be waged in 
a 
decisive, and determined way, till the end, just like the 
antiterrorist struggle. She pointed out that the first results 
of the economic struggle will be received next year. We will 
restore to Turkey the health it has not had for a long time, she 
said, adding: We stand behind our promise, we are confident we 
will fulfill it. I repeat, the economy will improve no matter 
what. 
  Ciller stated that the antiterrorist struggle has been waged 
effectively especially during the past five months. The number 
of terrorists caught during that period, she said, is half as 
many as were caught during the 113 months before that. 
  The prime minister pointed out that the public is 
increasingly believing that a significant distance will be 
covered in the fight against terrorism by the end of this year. 
  Ciller stressed every measure included in the economic 
package is being implemented, and that the Treasury will reduce 
its pressure on interest rates in the coming months.

<F P=106> [Report by Sedat Sertoglu: "An Appalling Trap for Turkey"] </F>
  [Text] Several groups in Europe, which are supported by 
pro-Greek-Cypriot and pro-Armenian elements in the U.S. Congress 
and Mrs. Danielle Mitterrand, have put into effect a very 
dangerous plan, which can fragment Turkey. These groups, which 
have not been effective enough in their initiatives in Europe, 
have managed to raise the Kurdish problem in Washington. In 
fact, they have already made several initiatives to influence 
the U.S. Congress and the newspapers. Several U.S. officials 
have already cautioned Ankara on the plan to divide Turkey. The 
Turkish Foreign Ministry officials have launched an effort to 
have the necessary measures put into effect against the new plan. 
  According to the experts, the plan, which has been drawn up 
by several groups that support the Greek Cypriots, Armenians, 
and the Kurds, is as follows: The United States will be 
frequently informed that Turkey's military operations against 
the PKK are aimed against the entire Kurdish people in that 
country. Turkey will be accused of committing an act of 
genocide against all the Kurds. Speakers will be selected to 
address the U.S. Congress commissions and international 
platforms on the matter. That will create a wave of pressure 
against the Clinton administration. Next will be a move by 
those who are aware that Turkey will not hold talks with PKK 
leader Abdullah Ocalan, to persuade that organization to reduce 
its terrorist activities and publish bulletins to defend its 
case. The PKK bulletins will be similar to those the PLO 
published in the past. 
<H5>  New Headquarters </H5>
  The next step will be an effort to find a country that will 
agree to host Abdullah Ocalan and his organization. An effort 
is being made at the present time to determine whether or not 
the PKK can be moved, as in the case of the PLO moving its 
headquarters to Tunisia after the defeat it suffered in Lebanon 
in the past. Two reasons have been given for that. The first 
is that the PKK will not be able to remain in Damascus after 
Syria and Israel conclude a peace agreement and the second is 
that Saddam Husayn will not agree to allow Ocalan and his 
organization to remain in Iraq because he eagerly waits for the 
embargo to be lifted. The experts have said that several 
initiatives have been made to find a new host country for the 
PKK either in north Africa or in Europe. 
  As soon as Ocalan and the PKK are transferred to a new 
country, the Western capitals, Washington in particular, will 
direct pressure on Ankara to force it to hold talks with Ocalan, 
who will have assumed a position similar to that of 'Arafat. 
Ankara will be informed that Ocalan is no longer involved in 
terrorist activities. 
  Meanwhile, the architects of that appalling plan will make 
every effort to disrupt relations between Ankara and Washington. 
They will use every opportunity to create friction between 
Turkey and the United States in the foreign policy domain. 
Furthermore, they will try to create a reaction in the U.S. 
public opinion against Turkey. 
  Considering all that, the experts have warned Ankara to be 
very careful.

  [Text] The photograph that the newspaper SABAH published 
last Tuesday [24 May] under the headline "Dirty Alliance!" 
exposed this paper's ties with the "intelligence units" and how 
it is being used by these circles. 
  It has been ascertained that the photograph of PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] leader Abdullah Ocalan and M. Yohanna, the 
Syriac Metropolitan of Aleppo, Syria, came from the archives 
that were seized during the 10 December 1993 police raid on the 
paper OZGUR GUNDEM, whose publication was banned last month by 
the Supreme Court. 
  SABAH resorted to an unbelievable lie to "prove" 
PKK-Armenian 
cooperation. It began its front page report on 24 May issue 
with the following statement: "`PKK-Armenian cooperation,' 
which Turkish Governments have known about for years and which 
was being denied particularly by pro-PKK circles, has finally 
been confirmed with specific documents." Claiming that after 
prolonged work by the Turkish intelligence units, PKK-Armenian 
cooperation was proven by photographs, SABAH asserted that the 
priests of the Armenian Gregorian Church met with Ocalan in 
al-Biqa', and that the extremist nationalistic Armenian Tashnak 
[Armenian Revolutionary Federation] Party has been providing 
arms and financial assistance to the PKK through the church. It 
also claimed that Ocalan wants to find shelter in Armenia and 
that Armenians play an important role inside the PKK. 
  It has now been determined that the Ugur Sefkat's report 
accompanying the photograph, which the paper described as a 
"document," is a complete lie. 
  The priest standing near PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is 
described as an "Armenian priest." In actual fact, however, the 
man in the photograph is M. Yohanna, the Syriac Metropolitan in 
Syria. 
  The second lie concerns the date. The date of the meeting, 
which Ocalan and Yohanna held on 10 March 1993 and which was 
then distributed to subscribers by KURD-HA and which was 
published in the monthly magazine OZGUR HALK in Turkey in July 
1993, has been "changed" to 3 May 1994. [sentence as published] 
  What SABAH called a "secret" meeting was fully published in 
a 
monthly paper that anyone can buy and read in Turkey. 
  According to SABAH's "news," following a tip off about the 
meeting the Armenian priests held with Ocalan, the Turkish 
intelligence officials went into action and photographed the 3 
May 1994 meeting. However, no explanation was given as to why 
Ocalan was wearing a winter overcoat in May, as shown in the 
photograph. 
<H5>  The Photograph Comes From OZGUR GUNDEM's Archives </H5>
  This photograph, under which some concocted information has 
been sprinkled and which was supposedly taken by the Turkish 
intelligence officials, was "seized" during the police raid on 
OZGUR GUNDEM on 10 December 1993. 
  The report, which was published in the magazine OZGUR HALK 
and which was transmitted with the photograph to OZGUR GUNDEM on 
the same day by KURD-HA, said that M. Yohanna, the Syriac 
metropolitan of Aleppo in Syria, paid a familiarization visit to 
PKK leader Ocalan on 10 March 1993 in Barr Ilyas in Lebanon. M. 
Yohanna and Ocalan discussed the problems of the Syriacs in 
South Kurdistan [Iraqi Kurdistan] and in the Mardin region and 
conversed on the common history of Assyrians and Kurds. 
  In the meantime, the press secretary of the Armenian 
Patriarchate in Istanbul told a television station that the 
attire of the priest in the photograph is not what is worn by 
the Armenian priests and that no such meeting took place.

  [Text] Erzincan, June 8 (A.A.) -- Fifty-four terrorists 
have been killed during operations carried out by security 
forces in the last five months in eastern Erzincan Province, it 
was reported on Monday [6 June]. 
  Erzincan Governor Recep Yazicioglu told the ANATOLIAN AGENCY 
that the operations were carried out in the rural areas and in 
the town center, without interruption and that the organization 
was crippled in the region. 
  `Twenty-five people who provided logistic and material 
support to a terrorist organization were also captured and 
arrested,' he added. 
  He also said that handguns, machine guns, ammunition and 
prohibited publications were also seized, adding four security 
force members were also killed. 
  Yazicioglu also stressed that the arrested terrorists' 
average age was 16 and this shows the organization is having 
problems recruiting new members.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Omer Ozturkmen: "Hypotheses, Projections"] </F>
  [Text] What would happen if Turkey had nuclear weapons? 
If I asked my friend at the Cankaya Mansion or Motherland Party 
leader Mesut Yilmaz this question, they would surely answer that 
they do not comment on hypothetical situations. 
  It is indeed necessary to think of hypothetical situations, 
however, in order to foresee the future. For futurists, every 
hypothesis is an alternative. Hypotheses are projections into 
the future, in a way. Refusing to comment on hypothetical 
situations is avoiding the issue. 
  If Turkey had nuclear weapons, the United States and Europe 
would not act like spoiled children in their relations with us. 
The United States would not even dream of slashing its aid to 
us under the pretext of human right violations. European 
countries would beg us to join the European Union. Customs 
restrictions would be lifted immediately and there would be no 
obstacles to the free circulation of Turkish workers in Europe. 
  While slashing its aid to us, the United States does not 
dare 
impose sanctions on Red China, where human rights are violated 
most. Why? Because Red China has nuclear weapons. 
  When the seven rich countries, including the four European 
countries, extended $80 billion in aid to Russia, did they ask 
what the situation was in connection with human rights? 
  Today, China and Russia are the two places where human 
rights 
are violated most. Remember a few months ago, the Russian 
parliament was raided and its members arrested. 
  While extending aid to Russia, did the United States or the 
Europeans question it about human rights? No, because Russia 
has nuclear weapons. 
  Even Vietnam has more prestige than we do today, because it 
has nuclear weapons. 
  Could we not build nuclear weapons? The experts must answer 
this question.

<F P=106> [Interview with Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring by </F>
Veronique Meutey; place and date not given: "Northern Ireland: 
Voting for Peace" -- first two paragraphs are LE FIGARO 
introduction] 
  [Text] The European election which takes place today in 
both Northern Ireland and Britain will be dominated by the 
conflict that has been racking the province for 25 years. 
Candidates fielded by three major parties are expected to be 
reelected: Ian Paisley for the Democratic Ulster Party (DUP), 
Jim Nicholson for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP, moderate), and 
John Hume, a Catholic, for the Social Democratic Labor Party 
(SDLP, moderately nationalist). 
  "European stakes transcend our traditional fault lines. If 
we can cooperate with other European countries in view of a 
common interest, then we can work together at home," John Hume 
pleaded, to no avail. Once again, political and religious 
differences will prevail. And both the SDLP, which has been 
defending the Anglo-Irish document, and the UUP, which still 
favors it, fear the disenchantment of moderate voters with the 
slowness of the peace process. In this context, Irish Foreign 
Minister Dick Spring explains Dublin's views on the European 
election's immediate stakes as well as the conditions for a 
potential referendum on Irish reunification. 
  [Meutey] What is at stake in this European election? 
  [Spring] It affords citizens a possibility of participating 
directly in the activities of European institutions. The powers 
of the Parliament have been significantly increased, and today 
it has a real decisionmaking role. As the leader of the Labor 
Party, I am confident. The Socialists will remain the major 
parliamentary group. 
  [Meutey] Has Euroskepticism taken hold in your country? 
  [Spring] No. The Irish are aware of the importance of the 
European Union [EU] and the need to increase its role in the 
years to come. Since Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, polls have 
shown that two-thirds of the Irish are in favor of it. 
  [Meutey] Which foreign policy do you think the EU should 
follow? 
  [Spring] More than ever before, the Europeans must be able 
to 
speak as one and to act together when faced with situations such 
as the Bosnian crisis, the repercussions of the former Soviet 
Union's collapse, and the problems in Northern Africa and the 
Middle East. Implementing the Maastricht Treaty is the only way 
to establish a European foreign policy. 
  [Meutey] How can the conflict in Northern Ireland be ended? 
  [Spring] Right now, the best way would be for the Loyalists 
and Republicans to seize the chance offered them by the Downing 
Street declaration and subsequent texts. If they acknowledge 
these texts, they agree to support negotiation efforts between 
London and Dublin. 
  [Meutey] Do you favor reunification? 
  [Spring] All we want today is to put an end to the killing 
in Ulster. For the time being, reunification is not on the 
agenda. We must show respect for the Loyalists, who want to 
retain their links with Britain. The identity of the 500,000 
individuals who want to retain their connections with the Irish 
Republic must be respected as well. 
  [Meutey] When would reunification actually happen, then? 
  [Spring] When a majority of Ulster's population has 
expressed a wish to see it happen.... 
  [Meutey] If Sinn Fein agrees to stop the violence, when 
would the referendum take place in Northern Ireland? 
  [Spring] Even if violence were to stop tomorrow morning, at 
least 12 months of talks would be needed. So the referendum 
could be held in both Northern and Southern Ireland within a 
year. 
  [Meutey] Will voters in Northern Ireland be asked the same 
question as in your country? 
  [Spring] Ideally, yes. But we must take into account 
differences between the two countries. There will likely have 
to be two different questions. 
  [Meutey] Will the referendums be held on the same day? 
  [Spring] Same day, same time....

<F P=106> [Report by Josef Joffe: "England and Germany United Against </F>
Europe?"] 
  [Text] Who is interested in Europe? The Germans have 
become skeptical since reunification and the British have always 
been so. The Danes said "no" to Maastricht on one occasion; in 
France, Europe just made it in the referendum. However, with 
just two weeks to go to the Strasbourg European Parliament 
elections, Europe fans have at least one consolation. The 
turnout will be particularly high. Eight out of 10 people 
eligible to vote said that they would "definitely" go to the 
polls; a further 15 percent said that it would be "very" likely 
or "quite probable." 
  Only 5 percent do not want to vote at all; even in England, 
the number of people who do not want to vote only accounts for 6 
percent of the electorate. What is the motivation of those 
radicals who do not want to vote? Almost a quarter of them 
across Europe said that the "election is unimportant" or "my 
vote does not count." Almost every fifth of those who are 
reluctant to vote do not know what is at stake. 
  Essentially, what one should assume is that the future of 
European integration is at stake. Should one proceed along the 
Maastricht path, should one do so more slowly, or should one 
just go back? This indicates a high degree of skepticism about 
Europe. In all 12 EU countries, 40 percent of those polled 
still say that they would like "less" integration. Half of 
those polled want "more," but there are some unexpected 
differences among individual member states. The figure for 
Britain is not surprising: Over 60 percent opt for "less 
integration." 
  Of course, the Germans, who were once so favorably disposed 
toward integration, have now become "British": Six out of 10 of 
those polled want "less" of a community, while those who are in 
favor of integration have fallen to about a third. The Germans 
and the Anglo-Saxons are in one boat -- that is the biggest 
surprise to come out of the poll conducted by SUEDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG and six other European partner newspapers during the 
second half of May. 
  The leading Europhiles are the Italians, closely followed by 
the Spaniards and the Dutch. Even the "Gaullist" French exceed 
the Germans in their support for integration. 
  Another way of measuring the support for integration is 
offered by questions on the powers of the European Parliament 
and the EU Commission. Do these supranational institutions have 
too much or too little power? If someone says "too little," 
then it can be assumed that he wants a stronger European state. 
In this respect, the European Parliament fares slightly worse 
than the community as such. Exactly half of the European 
electorate wants "more integration," but only 46 percent believe 
that the European Parliament has too few powers. Does it have 
too much power? That is the view -- this could have been 
foreseen -- held by the British (58 percent), but also by the 
Irish (43 percent), and the Greeks (37 percent). The 
percentages for these countries are similar with respect to the 
question of whether the EU Commission has too much power. 
  The EC Commission has always seen itself as the engine 
behind 
integration. Of course, it cannot draw too much strength from 
the poll, because the European public is undecided: The camps 
that say the commission has too much or too little power are of 
about the same strength (about 30 percent). 
  In short, the poll does not provide much ammunition for 
those 
who want a faster rate of progress on the way to a "closer" 
Europe. The picture is clearer with regard to expansion -- 
there are significant differences between the various groups of 
candidates for admission. Put bluntly: "Those who are like us 
can come in, but we are not so sure about those who have a 
different political and economic tradition." 
  Almost four-fifths of the 12-member community welcome the 
admission of Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Switzerland whereas 
not even 10 percent oppose that. That indicates a clear "yes" 
to expansion. The picture is more complicated in the case of 
the Central European applicants Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and 
the Czech Republic. Only half of those polled want to have them 
in the European Union [EU] and a third oppose their membership. 
With an approval rating of 60 percent, the Germans are above 
the EU average, but they are still significantly behind the 
Italians, who have turned out to be the East Europeans' best 
friends. 
  What about the issue of a European currency? The answer is 
on the one hand yes and on the other hand no. Half believe 
there will be a currency union composed of at least three 
currencies by the year 2000 and the other half does not want to 
believe that. Only the British stand out in this respect. 
Two-thirds believe -- or, to be more precise, fear -- that they 
could be confronted with a European currency in the next few 
years. 
  In a very indirect way, the poll sought to gauge the basic 
political climate in Europe, the question being "who trusts 
whom?" The results confirm a well-known picture: The French and 
the Germans trust each other the most. The French and the 
Germans trust the English, followed by the Italians, the least. 
However, cracks are appearing in the Franco-German marriage. 
Almost just as many French (17 percent) mistrust the Germans as 
trust them (20 percent). However, the Germans do not consider 
the French to be formidable opponents: Only a tiny number 
mistrust the former "archenemy." 
  Are the Europeans prepared to do more about the Balkans 
other 
than talks and reason? The clear answer is: "no." Not even a 
fifth of those polled support aerial bombardments; exactly 16 
percent support the deployment of ground troops. The German 
picture corresponds precisely to the European one. 
  The conclusion is that there are only European majorities on 
two issues. Almost everyone wants to go to vote and about 80 
percent support the expansion of the EU to include the 
Scandinavian and neutral states. The question of Europe's 
future -- should we continue along the path leading to the 
united states of Europe? -- remains open: Exactly half say 
"yes," 40 percent want a looser union, and the rest do not know 
what they want.

<F P=106> [Interview with Presidents Bill Clinton and Francois </F>
Mitterrand by correspondents Christine Ockrent and Patrick 
Poivre d'Arvor at the Elysee Palace in Paris--live; Clinton 
speaks in English with simultaneous translation into French] 
  [Excerpt] [Ockrent] Good evening, President Mitterrand. 
Welcome, President Clinton. You are not of the same 
generation, but yesterday in Normandy you shared the same 
emotions and used the same words to articulate freedom, and the 
sacrifices and efforts that we should make today to avoid war-- 
although war is still being waged in Europe and elsewhere today. 
Do you think, President Clinton, that this means neither Europe 
nor the United States have the determination they had 50 years 
ago. Is the today's Europe disappointing you? 
  [Clinton] No, because I do not think the two situations are 
easily comparable. I think the real question is how Europe is 
today as compared with the end of World War II, or even at the 
end of World War I. I think the answer is that we are doing 
much better than we did after World War I. Well, certainly, 
there are many uncertainties in the world, but no one's security 
seems to be immediately threatened. I see Europe coming 
together politically and economically. In terms of security, I 
see more cooperation with the United States--and economically 
with GATT--and with NATO and the Partnership for Peace. I see 
us working together in dealing with the problem in Bosnia. I 
know the Bosnian conflict has not been resolved, but we have 
made progress, and we are on the verge of a territorial 
settlement. So, I think Europe is on the way to a better 
situation in the 21st century. Have we resolved all the 
problems? No! But I am optimistic, especially after this trip. 
  [Ockrent] President Mitterrand, this is the first time, with 
President Clinton, that a Europe integrated politically or even 
militarily has received such support from the United States. Do 
you think--despite public opinion believing it less and less, as 
opinion polls indicate--that Europe should be integrated 
politically and militarily, or is it too late? 
  [Mitterrand] The United States contributed a lot when Europe 
began its integration. It helped and encouraged the founders of 
this Europe a lot, which was then called the community of six. 
This has now become a union of twelve and is about to become a 
union of 15 or 16. So, it helped us a lot. Then its attention 
was deflected by many problems. One can say it became less 
involved. It is true that a real interest in European 
integration has manifested itself with President Clinton. You 
asked a short while ago whether we were disappointed, when you 
asked President Clinton. As far as I am concerned, I believe 
less in the dissatisfaction of the public.... 
  [Ockrent, interrupting] Despite the opinion polls? 
  [Mitterrand] Yes, despite the opinion polls. Opinion polls 
are indicators and are important. One should take them into 
account, but I think Europe remains a major interest for 
everybody. This will be understood, but should not the 
defenders of Europe understand this first? 
  [Ockrent] Who are you thinking of there? 
  [Mitterrand] I am not thinking of anyone in particular. I am 
not trying to start a polemic. I am just saying that we need a 
lot of energy and persistence. It is difficult to create a 
successful Europe. After World War II, in 1945, we made a lot 
of progress right away with the United Nations. Gradually, with 
the disappearance of the Soviet Union, we have a chance for 
peace; however, we have not done enough yet. There are still a 
lot of problems to be settled. History is a long game of 
patience. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] I would like to ask President Clinton a 
question--hopefully your problems with the translation be 
resolved quickly. Philippe Seguin, the speaker of the Assembly, 
who welcomed you not long ago, drew a parallel with the 
situation in 1919 when they received your predecessor, Mr. 
Wilson. He said that, as in 1919, everything seems possible 
today, the worst as well as the best. 
  We have just come out of a long period of cold war. Are you 
sure that this is the best that we can hope for, first of all, 
and then do you see any place in Europe where perhaps you might 
imagine asking your boys [preceding word in English] to 
intervene--for example, in Bosnia? 
  [Clinton] Well, I do think the situation is similar to 
1919-- 
not the same, but similar. The difference, however, is that 
Europe did not unite in 1919, and the United States withdrew. 
In 1994, Europe is growing together in terms of the economic, 
political, and security system. The United States is still 
actively engaged in Europe. 
  Are there circumstances under which we might commit American 
troops? Absolutely, there are. We have a commitment to NATO, 
which we are honoring. We have already put our pilots at the 
disposal of NATO in Bosnia and also to enforce the no-fly zone. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] But could you do more on the ground? 
  [Clinton] We also have troops in Macedonia, at least to 
limit 
the conflict. We will do what is necessary to enforce an 
agreement if one is made, but we decided we should not intervene 
to settle the conflict on one side or the other. If we were to 
do it now, I think we would only create controversy. If we can 
get an agreement between the sides--I think the president and I 
are agreed--the United States is prepared to work with our 
allies, to make sure that the settlement is honored. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] And you, Mr. Mitterrand, are you 
disappointed by the lukewarmness of the U.S. commitment -- to 
repeat an expression used by Bill Clinton during his election 
campaign two years ago? 
  [Mitterrand] The U.S. commitment for peace, including for 
peace in the former Yugoslavia, is full and complete. 
  You know my position. I do not think this war will be 
resolved by creating another, more general, war. The United 
States will give us powerful help -- along with the Russians and 
all of the countries of the European Union -- not to impose 
conditions, which is not our role, but to stress issues in such 
a way that the belligerents will know that it is in their 
interest to reach conciliation. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] You both visited together the sites of the 
destruction of the war of 50 years ago. You know what is 
happening in Bosnia now. What ties does France want to develop 
with the United States? Are you ready to commit yourselves more 
to NATO, for example, to returning to the situation as it was 
before General de Gaulle's bomb shell? 
  [Mitterrand] No, that is not necessary. We participate in 
what might be called the political discussions of NATO -- that 
is to say, the alliance that we belong to and to which we are 
loyal. We do not participate in the discussions in the general 
staff, or in the military discussions, because we do not belong 
to the integrated command. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] And this position will not change? 
  [Mitterrand] No, it will not. Or at least, it will not as 
long as it depends on me. I do not think France will change its 
position on that for a long time. 
  You were saying just now that nothing had changed. I would 
just like to say a couple of words. Just remember that it was 
not so long ago that the world was cut in two, or at least 
Europe was. We had two military pacts facing each other; we had 
the Cold War. All that is behind us. Problems remain, as you 
said, and I will not repeat it. 
  [Ockrent] Among these problems there are some that affect 
our 
country in a special way: I mean Algeria. There were two more 
killings in Algiers this morning. It has been noticed that your 
administration has made several calls recently, Mr. Clinton, to 
the fundamentalists. Do you think that a dialogue should be 
opened with them, perhaps that they should even be allowed 
access to power? 
  [Clinton] Let me make sure I understand your question by 
restating our position. We try to support the current 
government, in working with France to reschedule their debt, for 
example. However, we have also encouraged this government to 
reach out to dissident groups who are not involved in terrorism, 
who disavow terrorism. 
  We have had some very low-level contacts with people who 
themselves have not been involved in terrorism. We do not 
support people using violent means anywhere in the world. We 
hope that the present Algerian Government will be able to 
broaden its base and reach out, and be able to work with those 
who have difficulties, but who have committed themselves to a 
peaceful solution. 
  We are very concerned about the rise of militant 
fundamentalism in the Islamic states. Seventeen of the 22 
Islamic states in the world [as heard] have declining incomes. 
Seventy percent of the Muslims in the world today are young 
people. The potential for explosion is great. We have a great 
stake in promoting governments like the Moroccan Government, for 
example: King Hassan has run a very responsible regime, and 
been helpful in peace in the Middle East and in many other ways. 
We share the concern of [word indistinct] for the potential of 
the situation in Algeria getting out of hand. But what the 
United States wants to do is to stand up against terrorism, and 
against the structure of fundamentalism, and to stand with the 
people of Islam who wish to be full members of the world 
community according to the rules that all civilized people 
should follow. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] Let us continue with Africa. The Americans 
were involved in great numbers in Somalia. Today, the Somalis 
are no longer dying of hunger, they are well fed. Further 
south, in Rwanda today, hundreds of thousands of people are 
butchering each other. Are the Americans ready to intervene? 
  [Clinton] No, but we are willing to help. We have already 
offered several million dollars. We have discussed with our 
African friends the prospect of an African force, which we will 
help to finance and support with equipment and transportation 
systems. We can help and we should help, but many African 
countries are interested in providing troops. I think this is 
the only thing we can do at the moment. We have troops in Korea 
and Europe. We will perhaps have new commitments in Bosnia if 
we manage to establish peace. We are trying hard to put the UN 
agreement on Haiti back on track. We want to help in Rwanda. 
We are ready to finance and provide the necessary aid if 
African countries provide troops. I don't think so many are 
needed to stop the fighting, if several African countries get 
together. 
  [Ockrent] And France, Mr. President? There has been a lot of 
talk about the support provided by France over a long period of 
time to the Rwandan Government whose situation we are aware of 
today. Could France.... 
  [Mitterrand, interrupting] France gave assistance to Rwanda, 
to the legitimate government of the day. Rebels rose up against 
this government and they had their valid arguments. They are 
winning some victories. It seems today that the Rwandan 
Government -- whose president was assassinated -- has 
practically been defeated. It was us, the French, who organized 
a dialogue between the belligerents and it was us who managed to 
broker an agreement, which is no longer valid today. We were 
thanked by the Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
  [Ockrent] What could be done today? 
  [Mitterrand] I would like to say to Mr. Clinton that I am 
very happy to receive him at the Elysee. I think that the 
countries chosen by the United Nations, that is Ghana, Senegal, 
and others, should be encouraged to provide the 5,500 men 
requested. We have already said that France was ready to 
provide logistical aid and any necessary support so these 
African forces, representing the OAU, will be able to intervene. 
  [Clinton] If I might make one point about that. One of the 
things we learned in Somalia, where we were able to save 
hundreds of thousands of lives, and we lost some of our people, 
mostly in one unfortunate incident, was that even a humanitarian 
mission will inevitably be caught up in the politics of the 
country, unless people are starving and dying because of a 
natural disaster. But if there is politics behind it, and in 
this case it is even more obvious what the political and 
military problems are, I think the United Nations was absolutely 
right to ask African countries to intervene, because they are 
the ones who will be there in the long term, and it is their 
frontiers that have to be respected. 
  France and the United States must support them, but I think 
it is an important test, and if we succeed, then that will be 
much more important for Africa in the long term. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] Since we are talking about the role of the 
United Nations, in an interview on foreign policy two and half 
years ago, before you were president, you said you were in favor 
of Japan and Germany having a permanent seat in the UN Security 
Council. Do you still agree with this principle? 
  [Clinton] Yes. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] Doesn't this worry you, Mr. Mitterrand? 
  [Mitterrand] It does not worry me that the Japanese and the 
Germans should join the Security Council as permanent members. 
I simply think that this membership of the highest body of the 
United Nations cannot be reserved for the Japanese and Germans 
alone. Because there is a whole area of the world, the most 
heavily populated part, which is not represented. So, this 
requires a little more general negotiation. But as for the aim 
of Japan and Germany, there is no reason to refuse these 
countries -- which are great powers, and very active ones, which 
play an important role -- the right to be there, with us. 
  We will not feel ourselves diminished if, instead of being 
five we are seven, eight, nine, or 10. But we will have to have 
slightly different procedures. 
  [Ockrent] What do you think of the idea put forward today by 
Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, of 
having an economic security council that would help to 
coordinate policies, in particular on the financial markets -- 
we are seeing at the moment the difficulties in short-term 
interest rate policies. Do you think it is a good idea, Mr. 
Mitterrand? Perhaps Mr. Clinton could react straight away. 
  [Mitterrand] I would say it is an interesting idea, because 
it is new, and it comes from a man who has had a lot of 
experience, and is highly competent -- Jacques Delors. I have 
my reservations, because we have to be careful lest the few 
richest countries in the world -- including France -- exercise a 
sort of control over multinationals, and transform themselves 
into a sort of global council Or else the makeup of this new 
body would have to be very carefully studied, so as to maintain 
a balance. 
  [Clinton] I think this recommendation is the result of the 
work Mr. Delors has already done, including problems of growth 
in Europe and job creation, and this is an issue we will tackle 
when the G-7 meets in Naples. I think that many people believe 
that there is a discrepancy between everyday life and what 
happens on financial markets -- the latter may react too much 
before there is even an inflation risk. This is something that 
must be discussed. 
  As for the idea of an economic security council, don't 
forget 
that the UN Security Council aims to solve all the main 
problems, one after the other. What would be the jurisdiction 
of such an economic council? I think that what Mr. Delors is 
doing is the following: He is asking us to tackle a problem for 
which no solution has as yet been suggested, but I am not sure I 
endorse this idea. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] On an economic level, you Americans have 
spent a lot of energy and a lot of money on the fight against 
communism. Are you ready to make the same kind of effort to 
help the former communist countries recover from their economic 
slump? 
  [Clinton] We are prepared to invest quite a lot in it. We 
have already cut down on defense quite a lot, as much as we can, 
I think. I am discussing this with my Congress and I am asking 
them not to make further cuts in the military budget but to 
increase aid, namely to the former Soviet Union, including 
Russia, Ukraine, and other newly freed countries. A significant 
part of what we must do is to get more investment and more 
exchange with all these new countries, but it is necessary for 
all Western countries to be concerned that what replaces 
communism succeeds, now that communism is gone. We do not want 
something that would be reminiscent of the past: A market 
economy must succeed, and we hope that it will succeed. 
  [Ockrent] In your speech to the National Assembly earlier, 
you highlighted the need to help democracies through their 
access to the market economy. The OECD said today that our 
countries, our developed countries, are far too rigid and that 
this may be one of the reasons for unemployment, which is an 
obsession in France and the United States. Mr. President, do 
you think that our societies are now ready to make sacrifices 
for more flexibility, which may enable us to open our markets 
wider to developing countries, which, in their turn, would buy 
from us? Do you think that this is an idea that the French 
public -- as well as the U.S. public -- is ready to listen to? 
  [Mitterrand] I would answer you easily if I was sure that I 
understood your question properly. After all, what does 
flexibility mean? I hear many people say that flexibility is 
needed. What is flexibility? If it only means asking for cuts 
in wages, getting rid of the arsenal of social laws protecting 
workers, then it should not be done. This is why I do not think 
it is wise to want to solve the crisis by making workers and 
those earning low or medium wages poorer than they were. Their 
situation is not that good to begin with. I would like to 
understand what you mean by flexibility. 
  [Ockrent] Mr. Clinton is perhaps able to tell us something 
about that. 
  [Clinton] First of all, let me say that there is no simple 
answer to your question. The United States may have a more 
flexible labor market than most European countries because, for 
instance, unemployment benefit is lower and income supplement is 
not as high. We may have a more open economy and perhaps less 
unemployment, but we pay the price for this. Our unemployment 
rate is quite low, but the growth or our wages has been very low 
over the last 20 years and inequality -- the gap between the 
poorest and the middle class -- is getting wider. This is not a 
good thing for a democracy. 
  What I hope we can do, through G-7 and perhaps the 
OECD....[pauses] is to see what all of us can do to solve this 
problem and see how we can make the best of employment while 
respecting the rights of the middle classes. It will be 
necessary for these issues, as well as the issues about the 
environment, to be dealt with together. This is not only about 
investment by our countries and the buying of our products but 
this is also about the increase of payment in their countries. 
  [Mitterrand] One cannot always talk about the economic 
aspect 
of things and omit the social aspect. Of course, I agree with 
all the measures that may make it possible for the economy to 
grow, but at the same time it is necessary to take social 
measures. I am very happy to see that we are currently making 
progress with the United States of America. The discussion that 
has taken place, which should enable us, in the framework of 
GATT for instance, to have a social clause and which could 
already lead to a ban on child labor, a ban on prison labor, the 
authorization -- the encouragement even -- to organize union so 
that it is not harassed or banned. All this means progress. It 
is only a start, a timid one, at an international level, within 
GATT, but it is already very good, and curiously, it is the 
United States, Mr. Bill Clinton, and the France of today that 
are at the forefront of this struggle. 
  [Ockrent] Unfortunately, you have not set an example. 
  [Mitterrand] No, we are currently holding talks. No, you 
should not say that, not at all. I am fighting within the 
European Community, which has become the European Union -- and I 
am not the only one -- for this Union, these 12 countries, to 
adopt social legislation. It was unbearable to think that we 
are always trying to develop the economy and that no guarantees 
are given to the most humble people. [passage omitted]

  [Text] There is a head-on clash between the government and 
RAI. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's attack on the public 
service broadcaster was immediately rejected by the opposition 
parties, which called for President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to 
intervene. Scalfaro and Berlusconi are scheduled to meet this 
afternoon. Atillio Romita reports: 
  The Council of Ministers will shortly turn its attention to 
RAI, but in the meantime the views expressed by Berlusconi have 
provoked the inevitable reactions. The head of government 
believes RAI is not only biased but also debt-ridden. He also 
believes an anomaly exists in that in a democratic country, 
public service television cannot go against the elected 
government. The opposition's reaction has been immediate. They 
have asked President Scalfaro to intervene. Nappi from the 
Communist Refoundation Party has lodged a complaint with the 
Rome prosecutor's office against Berlusconi and the Marco 
Taradash, chairman of the RAI watchdog committee. 
  RAI journalists who had been called out by their union, 
USIGRAI, and by the Italian Press Federation to protest against 
Berlusconi were outside the Chamber of Deputies building in Rome 
this morning, with protesting miners from the Sulcis company 
based in Sardinia, with are protesting to safeguard their jobs. 
  [Begin recording] [Giorgio Balzoni, secretary of USIGRAI] If 
the aim is to bring RAI under the control of the government, 
then I think the government will encounter our most fierce 
opposition. 
  [Vittorio Roidi, chairman of the National Press Federation] 
I 
believe this morning's demonstration outside the Chamber of 
Deputies building can signal the start of a great battle. It 
seems to me that the most important thing is that the 
journalists do not fight alone. [end recording] 
  Berlusconi will be received by President Scalfaro this 
afternoon to talk about the problem of public service 
broadcasting. Gianfranco Fini, the secretary of the National 
Alliance, has said that the antitrust laws and RAI were two 
interlinked problems that would have to be tackled by the 
government.

    [Editorial Report] Writing in the 28 May Lisbon weekly 
SEMANARIO, commentator Antonio Pinto Leite formulated a series 
of scenarios on the possible results of the 12 June European 
Parliament elections. The first scenario presupposes a rate of 
abstention of over 50 percent, not an impossible outcome, Pinto 
Leite commented, given that European issues "have lost their 
potential for drama" and that 13 June is a Lisbon holiday. Good 
weather could also aggravate the situation, he added. In this 
case, elections would lose their political-partisan meaning and 
highlight the gap separating Portugal from European issues. Both 
the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Socialist Party (PS) 
would bear the brunt of abstention, according to Pinto Leite, 
because of the affirmative vote they are asking their 
constituents to cast. In contrast, the Communist Party (PCP) and 
the Center Social Democratic Party (CDS) would gain because of 
the anti-European feelings they are attempting to arouse. 
  A second scenario would have the PS slightly overtake the 
PSD 
by 4 or 5 percentage points, a near-tie not of excessive concern 
for the PSD. In fact, Pinto Leite pointed out, a "thin" PS 
victory would last no more than a few weeks in the political 
debate and be "consumed by the summer season." A third scenario 
envisions a clear PS victory over the PSD, an outcome to which a 
number of polls lend credibility, which would "consecrate" an 
Antonio Guterres now under fire from President Mario Soares' 
entourage as the uncontested PS leader. Moreover, it would "set 
in stone" Guterres's strategy of a "PS without the PCP" for the 
1995 parliamentary elections. On the other hand, according to 
Pinto Leite, a clear-cut PS victory would push the PSD into a 
"mobilizing mood" for the last quarter of 1994, as it is always 
more difficult to "invert a logic or a tendency" than "manage an 
advantage." In spite of poll-induced indications; however, Pinto 
Leite commented, a PSD electorate that averted political defeat 
in the last municipal elections because it feared instability 
would wish to protect itself against this eventuality and would 
flock to the polls. 
  A fourth scenario is a PSD victory, which would cause 
sharper 
difficulties for the PS and Guterres, whose strategy would be 
questioned. The PCP is betting on this scenario, Pinto Leite 
asserted, for it alone allows the party to "dream" of an 
alliance with the PS. For its part, the CDS "ardently wishes" 
that such a scenario not come true, given that a clear-cut PS 
victory over the PSD would allow the CDS to maintain that the 
PSD "does not deserve an absolute majority," and that, 
consequently, a useful "vote of the Right for this party makes 
no sense," Pinto Leite contended. 
  While the previous scenarios presuppose that the CDS and the 
PCP obtain "reasonably good" results--perhaps 10 to 15 
percent--it is necessary to also take into account a bad outcome 
for the CDS, which would have "important" repercussions, as it 
would enshrine the idea that the party and the way it conducts 
policy are erroneous. In contrast, satisfactory results would 
return the party to the "heady first days" of Manuel Monteiro's 
leadership, Pinto Leite concluded.

today's three-hour meeting that discussions on the 
confidence-building measures have been terminated. 
  In a statement after the National Council meeting, 
Government 
Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the decision was made due to 
the lack of political will by the Turkish side, which has been 
ascertained by the UN secretary general. The spokesman also 
noted that the National Council examined options that the Greek 
Cypriot side should support, and added that these options will 
be finalized at a National Council meeting scheduled for 0900

<F P=106> [Report by New York correspondent Yavuz Bayder] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk 
concluded his Paris-Washington-New York chain of contacts, which 
were aimed at rescuing the Iraqi oil pipeline, with meetings he 
held in the United Nations yesterday. 
  In a news conference he held for Turkish and foreign 
reporters prior to his departure for Ankara, Sanberk stated that 
his contacts were constructive and that a common view was 
reached in connection with the oil pipeline with the five 
permanent member countries of the UN Security Council. 
  Using a very reserved language when discussing the outcome 
of 
his contacts in the United Nations, Sanberk said that, for now, 
he will not be able to give a detailed account of the accord 
reached with the five permanent member countries of the United 
Nations. Sanberk added: The preliminary accord focuses on a 
draft resolution which will enable a technical exemption in 
connection with the oil pipeline repairs. The applicability of 
the draft resolution within the framework of the embargo imposed 
on Iraq was emphasized during the discussions, Sanberk indicated. 
  Pointing to the importance of the resolution being in line 
with the United Nations decisionmaking mechanism, Sanberk 
stressed that he expects the draft resolution to be presented to 
the UN Security Council in a couple of weeks. 
  Sanberk indicated an additional meeting with the Baghdad 
administration will be necessary following these chain of 
meetings.

  [Text] Ankara, June 8 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
Ferhat Ataman said today that the straits regulations prepared 
and declared by Turkey have not been debated by the 
International Maritime Organization [IMO] and that the rejection 
of the regulations was out of the question. 
  He was reacting to a recent claim by the Russian Foreign 
Ministry that the IMO had not approved the proposals of Turkey 
on the straits and that Turkey was asked to adapt its 
regulations to the IMO resolutions. 
  Ataman said that it was not possible to share the Russian 
interpretation that the Turkish regulations were rejected by the 
IMO. 
  `The IMO Sea Safety Committee has reviewed and adopted all 
rules and recommendations for the passage of ships and traffic 
rules,' Ataman said. 
  Ataman recalled that the straits regulations were issued in 
the Official Gazette dated January 11, 1994 and the traffic 
charts were approved by the IMO. 
  `Turkey believes that the regulations to be put into force 
on 
July 1 and which are in harmony with the IMO regulations, 
contain all arrangements to provide security and environmental 
protection and are in the interests of all the countries and the 
world maritime,' he concluded. [sentence as received] 
  The straits regulations were prompted by the March 14 
collision in the Bosporus of an oil tanker and a freighter which 
killed 20 crew members and dumped thousands of barrels of oil 
into the waterway.

<F P=106> [Report by Flemming Behrendt: "Helveg Petersen: </F>
Flexibility Creates Jobs" -- from the ERHVERV section] 
  [Text] Paris -- On the first day of their meeting 
yesterday, the ministers from the OECD countries were able to 
reach agreement that worldwide competition, technical progress, 
and long-term structural changes are in the interest of member 
nations. From this, it follows that protectionism, 
old-fashioned production structures, and social rigidity -- to 
say nothing of stubbornness -- are to be condemned. 
  In his speech, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen 
(Radical Liberal Party) warned especially against state support 
which can harm competition -- a pointed message to the host 
country, among others. And the minister was able to voice 
particular thanks for the OECD's contribution to the 
normalization of the competition in the shipyard sector. 
  The meeting of ministers was able to give its backing to the 
OECD's major analysis of unemployment and job creation. On the 
subject of Denmark's modest position in the overall job creation 
picture in the 1980's, Helveg Petersen told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE: 
  ``The report clearly shows that there is a need to do more 
on 
the labor market side than we have done hitherto in the way of 
labor market reforms and the cuts in income tax which have been 
an important Danish structural problem. 
  ``But we have a good tradition in Denmark and it is that it 
is the two sides of industry which not only have the right to 
fix, but also the responsibility for the consequences of wage 
and working conditions. This is something that we will not 
change. 
  ``We must not start fixing minimum wages or other working 
conditions in law. A more flexible system would be an 
advantage.'' 
  [Behrendt] The meeting of ministers has spoken of the 
"inadequate and apathetic adjustment" of member nations' 
economies to the rapid changes resulting from technological 
progress, competition, and "globalization." 
  [Helveg Petersen] The two sides of industry would be very 
wise to study this material in detail and be inspired by what 
the wise people here have been sitting discussing. 
  But I remain very firm that this is their -- the two sides 
of 
industry -- problem. It is they who have to work to make 
adjustments and keep up the good tradition in order to create a 
more flexible system. 
  [Behrendt] Does the high level of social support in Denmark 
have a role to play? 
  [Helveg Petersen] I do not think we can attack the problem 
that way and immediately create a more satisfactory level of 
employment by changing the rules we already have. 
  [Behrendt] What can the Danish Government do in order to 
avoid the same defeat over proposals for lower wages for those 
entering the labor market as suffered by the French Government 
here this spring? 
  [Helveg Petersen] We can only emphasize to the two sides of 
industry that because of their great influence they have a joint 
responsibility for the employment situation. 
  They have to accept part of the "blame" for those things 
which go wrong. [Helveg Petersen ends] 
  Helveg Petersen was unwilling to speculate about which of 
the 
many recommendations in the OECD report will determine Denmark's 
profile when the secretariat comes to report on national 
profiles in the fall. 
  "But on the training and education side in particular, we 
have a big job to do."

  [Text] It is possible that Sweden will give Estonia 
support, both for dismantling nuclear reactors in Paldiski and 
for helping the Russian retired officers moving back home from 
Estonia. This was revealed during Prime Minister Carl Bildt's 
two-day visit to Estonia. Our correspondent in Helsinki 
Christina Gustafsson reports: 
  [Gustafsson] The Baltic News Service, BNS, reports that 
Prime 
Minister Carl Bildt said -- somewhat surprisingly -- that 
Estonia should not sign an agreement like the one between Russia 
and Latvia. Prime Minister Bildt did not say which aspects of 
the agreement should be different. The Estonian criticism of 
the agreement between Russia and Latvia has mainly been that all 
retired officers are allowed to stay in Latvia. Ever since the 
agreement was signed, the Estonians have stressed that such an 
agreement will never be topical for Estonia. Estonia cannot 
accept the fact that those officers who have, for example, 
worked in the intelligence services, the KGB, or the GRU, would 
be allowed to stay on Estonian territory. This constitutes an 
all too great security risk, according to the Estonians. 
  Parallel to Prime Minister Carl Bildt's visit, there was a 
new round of talks on the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Estonia. Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin headed the 
Russian delegation. He expressed a certain optimism when the 
talks were over. He did not think it impossible that an 
agreement will be reached enabling the Russian soldiers to leave 
Estonia before the last day of August. During the last few 
weeks, this timetable has been questioned by the Russians, 
because time is starting to run out. The negotiations will 
continue next week in Moscow. 
  The training submarines at the Russian military base in 
Paldiski, with two nuclear reactors, are another growing problem 
in the negotiations. Prime Minister Carl Bildt visited the top 
secret base today and said later that it is easily possible to 
tear it down in a couple of weeks. The Russian side says that 
it will take from three to 10 years to dismantle the base. 
Because the Russians consider that Paldiski contains military 
secrets, neither Estonian nor foreign experts will be allowed to 
enter the base. The Estonian negotiators are of the opinion 
that Paldiski and all other bases should be handed over to 
Estonia on the last day of August.

<F P=106> [Ewa Thibaud report: "Social Democratic EU Supporters </F>
Polish Their Arguments"] 
  [Text] Yes, indeed. Of course it will be possible to 
pursue Social Democratic policies if Sweden becomes a member of 
the EU [European Union], in the view of the Social Democratic EU 
supporters. Yesterday they made public their debate document in 
preparation for the party extraordinary congress. 
  "It will be harder work and more difficult to pursue a 
Social 
Democratic policy in Sweden if we remain outside th EU," Mats 
Hellstrom, the party's EU spokesman, said. 
  The Social Democrats' pro-EU group is therefore voicing 
views 
that are completely different from those of the no-side which 
made its view public last week. While the no-side believes that 
membership is a threat to democracy, the yes-side says that 
membership will save Sweden from the "dictatorship of the 
market." 
  "First we have to get a Social Democratic government. But 
that is not enough in itself," Ines Uusman, chairman of Social 
Democrats for the EU, said. 
  She explained her reasons for making propaganda for the EU 
somewhat in the manner of Pastor Jansson by comparing the EU to 
a potato peeler. 
  "Politics is like a potato. It is good and useful, and can 
be used for many things. But it is more useful if you have a 
potato peeler. The EU is one such potato peeler." 
  Mats Hellstrom's argument was a little simpler. He talked 
about the reshaping of Europe. 
  "It is now that things are happening. And we Social 
Democrats in Sweden are self-confident. We know that we have 
something to contribute and we want to be involved and exert an 
influence." 
  To questions of finances the Social Democrats have woolly 
answers. According to Mats Hellstrom, they do not need to put 
forward any detailed proposals about how the contribution to the 
EU is to be paid, not before the government has made it clear 
how the contributions from the EU are to be allocated and how 
great the net cost of membership will be. The Social Democratic 
yes-group is expecting a bill of 10 billion kronor. 
  "The money must come from production," Ines Uusman replied. 
  She gave some clarification by mentioning large farmers and 
property owners. These will have an "EU duty" imposed on them. 
  "The end result must be neutral from the point of view of 
the 
distribution of wealth," Mats Hellstrom. 
  This means that no one should profit from Sweden's becoming 
a 
member of the EU. If anyone does profit that profit must be 
taken from him or her. Mats Hellstrom also thought that the 
government and the Federation of Swedish Farmers are currently 
overestimating the profits for farmers. 
  "The contribution from the EU will chiefly go to compensate 
for price cuts," he said. 
  Leif "Blomman" Blomberg and Kerstin Alnebratt from Goteborg 
also took part in yesterday's presentation of the yes-program. 
  "Blomman" said that his strongest reason for being in favor 
of membership is trade union cooperation. Kerstin Alnebratt 
said that the EEA [European Economic Area] is not enough. 
  "It is not enough to be part of a market." 
  However, the program declares that the biggest tragedy if 
the 
Swedes were to choose to remain outside the Eu is that the 
Social Democratic Party would then lose its membership in the 
ESP, the European social democrats' party.

  [Text] Vienna, June 9 KYODO -- The following is the full 
text of a proposed resolution concerning the International 
Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] call for North Korea to comply 
with the nuclear safeguards agreement. 
  Implementation of the agreement between the Agency and the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the application of 
safeguards in connection with the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [NPT] (infcirc/403) 
  The board of governors, 
  (a) recalling the board of governors resolutions gov/2636 of 
25 February 1993, gov/2639 of 19 March 1993, gov/2645 of 1 March 
1994, and the general conference's resolution gc 
(xxxvii)/res/624 of 1 October 1993 finding the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to be in non-compliance with 
its safeguards agreement (infcirc/403), 
  (b) taking account of the fact that the DPRK remains a party 
to the NPT and is therefore bound by its safeguards obligations, 
  (c) recalling also that the board, in accordance with the 
statute and the safeguards agreement between the DPRK and the 
IAEA, has reported the DPRK's non-compliance to the United 
Nations Security Council on 1 April 1993 and on 22 March 1994, 
as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance 
of international peace and security, 
  (d) noting with deep regret the director general's written 
and oral reports of 2 June 1994 and 3 June 1994 and his 
statement to the board on 7 June 1994 in which he reported that 
the limited opportunity which remained for the IAEA to select, 
segregate and secure fuel rods from the DPRK's five megawatt 
reactor for later measurements in accordance with Agency 
standards had been lost, and that the Agency's ability to 
ascertain, with sufficient confidence, whether nuclear material 
from the reactor had been diverted in the past had also been 
lost, 
  (e) recalling further the 30 May 1994 statement by the 
president of the Security Council, particularly the request to 
the IAEA director general to maintain IAEA inspectors in the 
DPRK to monitor activities at the five megawatt reactor, 
  (f) noting also that the Agency has been able to perform 
certain safeguards activities in the DPRK and the director 
general's reaffirmation that the secretariat remains available 
to conduct inspection activities as required by its safeguards 
agreement with the DPRK or requested by the United Nations 
Security Council, 
  (1) deplores the DPRK's failure to implement essential 
elements of resolutions of the board and the general conference 
concerning its non-compliance with its safeguards agreement 
(infcirc/403), 
  (2) finds that the DPRK continues to widen its 
non-compliance 
with its safeguards agreement by taking actions which prevent 
the Agency from verifying the history of the reactor core and 
ascertaining whether nuclear material from the reactor had been 
diverted in past years, 
  (3) strongly supports and commends the tireless efforts by 
the director general and the secretariat to implement the 
safeguards agreement, 
  (4) calls on the DPRK immediately to extend full cooperation 
to the IAEA secretariat, in particular by providing access to 
all safeguards-relevant information and locations, 
  (5) encourages the director general to continue his efforts 
to implement fully the safeguards agreement and, in particular, 
to retain all IAEA safeguards measures effectively in place, and 
to make available safeguards inspectors and equipment in the 
DPRK as requested by the United Nations Security Council, 
  (6) decides, in conformity with the provisions of article 
xii.c. of the statute, to suspend non-medical assistance to the 
DPRK being provided by the Agency, 
  (7) requests the director general to transmit this 
resolution 
to all members of the agency and to the Security Council and the 
General Assembly of the United Nations, and 
  (8) remains seized of the matter and requests the director 
general promptly to report all relevant developments on this 
issue to the board.

  [Text] Istanbul, June 9 (A.A.) -- NATO does not foresee 
any basic changes in the Conventional Forces in Europe [CFE] 
Reduction Treaty, except in a number of flexible articles of the 
agreement, it was reported on Thursday [9 June]. 
  Sources said that Russia would be involved in `far-reaching' 
but informal cooperation going beyond a simple Partnership for 
Peace accord. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier said this 
was natural given `Russia's size, broad interests, resources and 
military capabilities.... Russia is and will remain a vital 
actor in European security affairs.' 
  `But Moscow must first sign a Partnership for Peace accord 
which 18 of its Cold War allies have already signed,' he added 
in his address. 
  The allies agreed to promise Russia cooperation and 
consultations outside a Partnership accord, notably nuclear 
safety and disarmament issues, sources said. 
  The allies invited Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
to 
sign a Partnership accord soon at the NATO headquarters in 
Brussels, Belgium. Simultaneously, the two sides would then 
issue a declaration spelling out in detail their future 
cooperation, officials said. 
  Thursday's meeting opened with a promise to NATO's immediate 
neighbors to the east that the alliance has no plans to use 
Moscow to draw `new dividing lines across Europe' as happened at 
the February, 1945, Yalta conference by Russia, the United 
States and Britain. 
  NATO Deputy Secretary-General Sergio Balanzino said Russia 
`is and will remain the single most powerful nation in Europe.' 
But NATO has no intention to cooperate with Moscow `in 
so-called Yalta-2,' he added. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said better relations 
with Moscow was `a matter of huge importance' as NATO seeks to 
craft a new European security order after the cold war. 
  The Partnership for Peace provides for broad political and 
military cooperation, including joint maneuvers. NATO will also 
help the East European nations draft defense budgets and convert 
arms industries to civilian purposes. It stops short of 
providing any security guarantees, but will allow for eventual 
NATO membership for some East European countries.

  [Text] Istanbul, June 9 (A.A.) -- British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd said at the opening ceremony of the NATO 
foreign ministers meeting that the Cold War is over and now the 
time is coming for cooperation and partnership. 
  He said that relations with Russia have a great importance 
for NATO, expressing satisfaction upon the announcement by 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev that Russia will sign the 
Partnership for Peace [PFP] document. 
  Referring to a demand by Russia on `flexibility' within the 
document, Hurd said that the PFP has a very realistic character 
and it is large enough for including each country. 
  He also recalled words said earlier by Foreign Minister 
Hikmet Cetin, adding that NATO will make every effort for 
bringing lasting peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Excerpt] Istanbul, June 8 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister 
Hikmet Cetin on Wednesday [8 June] said that Turkey supports the 
expansion with time, of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
adding however that NATO-Russia relations should not overshadow 
its ties with other members. 
  He was speaking to reporters prior to a NATO ministers 
council meeting and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council 
meetings which will start in Istanbul and will end on Friday. 
  Reminding that Russia accepted the Partnership for Peace 
plan 
during the meeting last January, he added that the most 
important factor there is that former Warsaw Pact members and 
Russia will sign a single agreement. 
  A joint document is expected to be signed at the end of the 
NATO meetings and paragraphs directly concerning Russia are 
expected to take place in the meeting. [sentence as received]

  [Text] Ankara, June 10 (A.A.) -- President Suleyman 
Demirel said on Thursday [9 June] that the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization was the main pillar of the principle of the 
superiority of law, democracy and human rights. 
  `We wish that the Black Sea, Aegean and Mediterranean will 
bring the nations nearer rather than separating them,' he said. 
  Demirel hosted a dinner for the foreign ministers of the 
countries which participated in the NATO foreign ministers 
meeting at the Dolmabahce Palace. 
  In his address Demirel recalled that Turkey had hosted in 
1980 a similar meeting. 
  `I was prime minister at that time, I believe that I am in a 
position capable of evaluating developments that occurred in 
Europe in politics and security since then,' he said adding that 
at that time Europe was divided by hostile blocs and Germany was 
divided. 
  `We've travelled great distances since then. The NATO 
meetings took place in a Europe where hostility between the 
blocs has been replaced by cooperation for security. Our 
continent is no more divided by the abyss of the Cold War,' he 
said. 
  `Globalization is becoming the sole concept for peace, 
developments and prosperity,' he added. 
  Pointing out that the Dolmabahce Palace was situated on the 
Bosporus, which overlooks the other continent, Demirel said, 
`This is an excellent place for such an occasion because it is a 
living symbol of the Turkish society. This is a point where 
continents join each other, cultures and civilizations interact 
and strategic interests conflict.' 
  He added that the modern city of Istanbul in Mustafa Kemal 
Ataturk's Turkey is a typical symbol of all dynamics which make 
Turkey an inseparable part of the West. 
  `NATO has extended its arm to countries which were our 
enemies in the past. Our approach has been expressed in the 
initiative of the Partnership for Peace accord which increases 
mutual trust, facilitates the filling of the confidence vacuum, 
creates a discussion forum and shows our search for a global 
peace,' he said. 
  Demirel went to on say that the massacre in Yugoslavia was a 
disgrace and the reluctance of the international community to 
bring an end to this ethnic cleansing, was a very dangerous 
example. 
  On terrorism, Demirel said no reason or pretext could 
justify 
terrorist actions. 
  `All of us have a responsibility when one of our members 
becomes a target of terrorism which targets the territorial 
integrity of a country,' he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr Lorenz Schomerus, ministerial director in the </F>
FRG Ministry of Finance: "The Framework for the New World 
Economy--Where Do We Go After Marrakech?"] 
  [Text] The eighth round of the multilateral trade 
negotiations between 125 GATT partners, the Uruguay Round, was 
formally concluded in Marrakech a few weeks ago. With the 
proviso of ratification, Federal Economics Minister Guenter 
Rexrodt signed the Final Act for Germany, the treaty on 
establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the 
agreement on the public procurement system; Sir Leon Brittan 
signed for the European Union [EU]. The results achieved are a 
very essential contribution to the further liberalization of 
world trade. At the same time, this conclusion also lastingly 
strengthens the credibility of an open, predictable and 
dependable multilateral trade system as well as confidence--so 
very important in the present economic situation--in the growth 
and job creation effectiveness of international trade. 
  The spread of the final results, as well as the spectrum of 
prospective tasks after the Marrakech conference, cover a very 
wide range and require differentiated consideration. Above all, 
it now concerns rapidly implemented ratification procedures in 
the national parliaments of the member states. This step is 
necessary since the Final Act of the Uruguay Round, comprising 
over 20,000 pages, touches not only upon Community [EU], but 
also upon national jurisdictions of the Federal Government and 
the laender. Only subsequently, forseeably by 1 January 1995, 
can the important general conditions for a dynamic economic 
development and for global growth impulses be further improved 
by the agreed-upon regulations, such as 

  -  an average 
30-percent lowering of tariffs on market access for industrial 
goods, 
  -  the agreement on protection of intellectual property, 
  -  the 
new subsidy and antidumping clauses, 
  -  reduction of nontariff 
trade obstacles, and 
  -  founding a World Trade Organization as the 
new institutional and legal framework of multilateral trade 
relations. 

  On all other issues, not yet--or not yet 
completely--resolved 
through agreements, such as audiovisual and financing services, 
basic telecommunications, ocean traffic, steel, and civilian 
aviation, subsequent negotiations will have to be conducted 
within the framework of the new WTO. 
  In addition, there is the large sector of entirely new and 
ever more complex tasks, due to the growing integration of the 
economies of the member states in world trade, for the time 
after Marrakech. They must be resolved within the framework of 
the WTO as the future permanent forum for multilateral trade 
negotiations, as the place for implementation of integrated 
arbitration proceedings, and as the institution for cooperation 
with international organizations (IMF, World Bank). 
  Even during the Uruguay Round negotiations, which lasted for 
a period of seven years, several sides demanded inclusion of 
additional issues, such as the problem of interfacing trade and 
environment. Both areas are linked to each other in many ways 
since, for example, the production and transport of goods, and 
their global export and import often are not environmentally 
neutral. Vice versa, environmental protection policies, often 
with direct intervention, have a restrictive effect on 
international trade. Environmental standards in international 
agreements, which could bring relief, to this day are very 
little in harmony. That is why it is now urgently necessary to 
deepen the analysis of this problem to develop generally 
accepted substantial guidelines, which will also take into 
consideration the special sensitivities of developing countries. 
The WTO, in the wide-ranging framework of its functions and in 
the preamble of the agreement, which expressly embodies the goal 
of protecting the environment, possesses a solid foundation for 
this work. Precisely for this purpose, a permanent WTO 
commission was established in Marrakech, whose members are 
recruited from experts of the trade and environment sectors. 
<H5>  Now Come Social Clauses </H5>
  Without a doubt, the question of linkage between trade and 
social standards, primarily discussed in U.N. agencies, will 
soon also be on the agenda of trade policy bodies. This already 
became clear in Marrakech, above all because of the insistence 
of the United States for incorporation of a social clause in 
GATT or WTO, respectively. The Federal Government recognized the 
urgency of defusing this tense situation, but warned at the 
minister conference in Marrakech against rash steps. 
  The discussion of social standards will not be easy to 
conduct. Fundamental economic interests of the developing 
countries are affected. Demands for social standards are met 
with suspicion, especially by developing countries. They suspect 
that the often demanded import measures and obligation to mark 
the origin of goods in reality are protectionist aims of 
industrial countries to the detriment of their advantages of 
location. Such shortsighted, misunderstood protective interests 
would rob developing countries of the gains in prosperity and 
growth resulting--especially for them--from increased global 
trade, and which are the important, even decisive, basis and 
prerequisite for better working conditions and higher social 
standards in those countries. 
  Introduction of social standards cannot be forced on 
developing countries by threatening import measures, which, with 
regard to the groups affected (children, prisoners, etc.), 
probably would have little effect. Thus it is better to link the 
purposeful liberalization of global trade with an open--and 
mutually understanding--political discussion with the developing 
countries on improved work and social standards in order to move 
these countries to constructive cooperation. In principle, the 
WTO is open to dealing with this problem. However, with a view 
to a fruitful discussion, one should avoid the mistake of 
completely excluding the bodies originally in charge of dealing 
with these issues, just because a new organization has been 
created. The work of the WTO can only build meaningfully on the 
expertise and clarity developed by U.N. agencies and the ILO 
[International Labor Organization]. Also, the overall work of 
the WTO must not be dominated or especially not paralyzed by 
this subject. 
  Past GATT practice, and also the negotiations in the Uruguay 
Round, have shown that not all trade-related problems can be 
covered by existing trade policy regulations. With the 
increasing internationalization of entrepreneurial activity and 
the globalization of the markets, the overlapping of policies on 
trade and competition on the international scene has grown. 
Competition-distorting practices such as managed trade, export 
cartels, laser beaming and structural barriers, either by 
enterprises or governments, or by the interplay of both, also 
have trade-restrictive effects which considerably limit access 
to markets. 
  Vice versa, the application of "legal" trade policy tools 
such as antidumping or countervailing subsidy measures also can 
have a distorting and trade-restrictive impact if used in a 
manner impairing competition. Political pressure, such as 
reacting with trade policy measures to such distortions in 
competition, can easily arise in such a situation and lead to 
making GATT agreements and concessions worthless. To avoid this, 
an international organization on competition as a regulative 
framework for global activities seems the most sensible solution 
for this problem. An agreement should be achieved as soon as 
possible on the "whether and how" of a possible integration in 
the WTO. 
  The integrating goals of the Uruguay Round, and hence the 
direction of multilateral trade relations, are confronted with 
every kind of protectionism. A comprehensive liberalization of 
world markets, particularly also with regard to the newly 
adopted areas of services and intellectual property, has a real 
chance only in open markets. Integration of the countries of 
East Europe also will succeed only with open markets. Naturally, 
under the pretext of the job argument, it would be easier at the 
moment to close the markets to cheap Eastern imports, whether in 
the EU or in Germany. It must be remembered that all countries 
in the Community have assumed political responsibility for the 
economic recovery in the East. 
<H5>  Open Up the Markets </H5>
  In this context, monetary transfers are indispensable and 
justified in the short term. In the longer term, however, they 
contradict the logic of the market economy, and they are not 
bearable in view of the resulting burdens on the economies, 
especially that of Germany, which additionally has to cope with 
the economic restructuring of the new laender. They affect the 
economy and consumers in the form of higher taxes and levies, in 
their final impact endangering jobs from the other side. Hence 
opening markets for products is the only adequate possibility to 
promote economic stability in the reform countries, to 
meaningfully support the structural adjustment process and 
integration into the multilateral trade system, based on 
division of labor. 
  But opening the markets also means including regional 
federations such as ASEAN, NAFTA, APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation], and EU, already liberalized as free trade zones. 
GATT, or the WTO as the active organ of multilateral 
negotiations, can build on these successful regional integration 
processes when it is a matter of implementing further 
integration efforts. At the same time, one must not ignore the 
dangers resulting from these agreements with regard to bloc 
formation, sealing off regional markets, etc. Thus the WTO, in 
interaction with these federations, will also face the task of 
finding ways for their further integration into the multilateral 
trade system.

<F P=106> [Article by Antoon Wouters: "Belgium Thwarting European </F>
Packaging Directive Today"] 
  [Excerpts] Belgium does not agree with the amendment by the 
European Parliament (EP) to the European Directive for packaging 
and packaging waste, and will oppose the directive. This was 
announced by Federal Environment Minister Jacques Santkin in 
Luxemburg yesterday. The issue will be discussed at the 
European Environment Council today. Germany, the Netherlands, 
and Denmark are also rejecting the directive. Santkin took the 
decision at the request of Flemish Environment Minister Norbert 
De Batselier, and after a verbal dispute at the interministerial 
foreign policy conference. 
  According to Santkin, the changes made by the EP to the 
directive, disturb the balance which was reached at the end of 
1993 between environmental protection and the safeguarding of 
the internal market. This compromise was reached thanks to the 
European Union's Belgian presidency. As a result of the 
directive's blocking, the Commission and the Environment 
Ministers will have to find a new compromise with the EP. 
[passage omitted] 
  De Batselier and Santkin fear that the amendment could 
jeopardize the Belgian ecological tax on disposable packagings.

<F P=106> [Ferdinand Hennerbichler report: "Neutral Austria Welcome!"] </F>
  [Text] WEU [Western European Union] Chief Eekelen tells 
NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG: If Austria joins the European Union [EU], 
it need not give up its neutrality. Wars among EU partners 
would be impossible. If we were attacked, multinational WEU 
troops would come to our rescue. Regarding EU security issues, 
Austria need not do anything that it does not want to do 
voluntarily. 
  "Neutral Austria is welcome in the WEU. It can participate 
fully and can play an important peace role." In an exclusive 
interview with NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG, WEU Secretary General Dr. 
Willem van Eekelen confirms: Austria can fully participate in 
the EU's security policy without having to give up its tried and 
tested neutrality. 
  The WEU chief's statements in NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG are the 
most effective arguments so far against storytellers in our 
country who claim that we would have to give up our neutrality 
if we joined the EU. 
  As Dr. Eekelen makes clear, all of Europe has changed 
drastically -- the WEU like the issues involving neutrality. We 
would approach each other, grow together. Neutrality is "no 
obstacle to actively participating in the EU's security policy." 
The three great principles of Austria's military neutrality -- 
not to join any military alliance, not to tolerate any foreign 
troops, and not to declare war on anyone -- are nowadays 
accepted all over Europe as general principles for safeguarding 
peace. First, there are no longer and Cold War military 
alliances. Van Eekelen: "The WEU is a military alliance that 
is changing in the direction of a global European security 
system." Austria is playing "a vital peace role" in this 
process. Second, the question of having foreign troops on 
Austrian territory is no longer topical if we join the EU. In 
case of war the EU would come to rescue Austria from attackers 
and would drive away enemy troops. Third, the WEU "will never 
declare war on anyone." 
  Asked whether Austria would then have to shed all its blood 
on Europe's battlefields in the WEU's defense wars, Eekelen 
gives a determined answer: This is "not the case at all." The 
WEU is establishing a "multinational task force" for 
emergencies. This task force is organized along national lines. 
It will ensure peace with arms. Participation is "voluntary." 
A WEU army is not planned. Further, Austria will "not be 
forced to do things it does not agree with." Decisions on 
security issues are "made only unanimously" in the EU. Austria, 
too, has the right to veto decisions. 
  Regarding international peacekeeping missions, the WEU would 
"not do anything without the United Nations and the CSCE." Van 
Eekelen: "Let us build this European security system together!"

<F P=106> [Report signed "SN": "Zernatto's Election: Problems to the </F>
Last"] 
  [Text] Klagenfurt -- On Tuesday [7 June] Carinthian 
Austrian People's Party [OeVP] Chairman Christof Zernatto was 
elected Carinthian governor with the votes of the OeVP and the 
Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe]. Shortly before the 
elections, the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] presented its own 
candidate: SPOe caucus leader Peter Ambrozy. The SPOe, 
fulfilling the condition imposed earlier by FPOe Chairman Joerg 
Haider [that the SPOe, as the party with the highest number of 
votes, must present the proposal to elect Zernatto], presented 
Zernatto as its candidate for governor. 
  The FPOe supports the principle that the party with the most 
votes should provide the head of government, FPOe caucus leader 
Martin Strutz said, justifying the FPOe's election proposal. 
After an interruption in the meeting, Ambrozy himself made it 
clear that he is not available as a candidate. He called 
himself one of the builders of the SPOe-OeVP coalition; 
therefore, he will abide by this agreement and exercise his 
personal right to renounce running for governor. 
  Christof Zernatto was elected provincial governor with 20 of 
the 36 votes cast. On 13 ballots -- as many as the FPOe has 
seats in the Landtag -- the name "Ambrozy" was written; three 
votes were invalid. 
  Michael Ausserwinkler, Dietfried Haller (both SPOe), and 
Robert Lutschounig (OeVP) were sworn in as new government 
members. Karin Achatz (SPOe), Joerg Freunschlag, and Mathias 
Reichold (both FPOe) were already members of the Carinthian land 
government during the previous legislative period. 
  In his government statement, Zernatto noted that all three 
political parties have made mistakes over the past three weeks, 
and this has confirmed one argument: Carinthia needs political 
unity more than ever before. Therefore, confidence-building 
measures should be implemented step by step.

<F P=106> [Report by Werner Hofer] </F>
  [Text] Attentive customs officials in the area of the 
Linz-Hoersching airport have prevented an illegal export of war 
materiel. Spare parts for Russian MiG fighters were involved. 
The security authorities have not ruled out that the shipment 
was intended for the war zone in Bosnia. 
  Twelve crates were delivered by truck to Hoersching on 
Tuesday [7 June] and stored intermediately at the customs office 
there. The goods arrived from a CIS state. Security authorities 
have so far not revealed which one. The truck entered the 
country at some border crossing. The freight documents were 
issued in cyrillic letters. They were not translated by the 
customs officers. Thus, no one knew that the consignment 
contained spare parts for MiG fighters. The documents 
themselves were fine. When the goods were stored at Hoersching 
airport, attentive customers had the documents translated. Then 
the suspicion arose that war materiel might be involved the 
import and transit of which is not permitted. The freight was 
to be transported to Amsterdam from Hoersching. Officially, the 
spare parts were to be forwarded by air freight from there to 
India. However, the security authorities do not rule out that 
the MiG spare parts were really destined for the war zone in 
Bosnia. 
  The 12 crates were confiscated, and legal 
proceedings--against unnamed individuals--have been initiated 
given the violation of the war materiel law has been initiated. 
It has to be clarified whether the truck drivers knew what the 
sealed crates contained.

<F P=106> [Report signed "sig.": "Special Troop on New Drug Route"] </F>
  [Text] Klagenfurt -- At the Thoerl-Maglern checkpoint, the 
Austrian customs authorities have established a new six-member 
special unit against international drug smuggling. "Since the 
beginning of the war in former Yugoslavia, a new drug route has 
developed from Turkey to the port of Trieste," Helmut Gram, 
chief of the Carinthian customs guard, reported on Monday [6 
June]. 
  Direct ferries from Turkey with up to 140 truck trains on 
board arrive in Trieste three times a week. As international 
investigators know, for the major part of illegal drug 
smuggling, these new opportunities are used for supplies to 
Germany. About 50 percent of the arriving trucks cross the 
Italian-Austrian border in Thoerl-Maglern. For some weeks, five 
male and one female special officers, with the most modern 
equipment and a drug sniffer dog, have been on duty around the 
clock. Three members of the drug squad have had experience in 
Burgenland, where the first Austrian special unit against drug 
trafficking was established and is working successfully. 
  There will also be more controls on tourist traffic. "If 
there is any suspicion, it might take hours to search a 
passenger car," Gram said, "but in general it will been seen to 
that there are no major obstructions of the tourist traffic." 
Cooperation with the Italian customs and port authorities has 
is going well, the drug specialists reported.

<F P=106> [Article by Ruben Mooijman and Nadia Dala: "We Are Not </F>
Engaged in Politics Here; Spokesman for Milli Gorus Toning Down 
Allegations About Fundamentalism"] 
  [Excerpts] Is the Turkish Islamic organization Milli Gorus 
a hotbed of dangerous fundamentalism, as is claimed by the 
Flemish Bloc? On the evening before the European Milli Gorus 
congress in Antwerp, DE MORGEN spoke with Necmettin Efe, a 
member of the board of the Federation of Islamic Associations, 
Milli Gorus' Belgian section. 
  Although virtually unknown to most Belgians, Milli Gorus 
(Turks for Islamic Perspective) is a very powerful organization 
in the Muslim world and in Flanders. In addition, the 
organization is expanding at a terrific pace. In 1976, the 
Belgian Milli Gorus was formed by 16 people. Today, the 
organization has 5 to 10 thousands members and supporters. "I 
estimate that within a few years, half of the 85,000 Turks in 
Belgium will be either members or supporters of Milli Gorus," 
Necmettin Efe says. "We have a lot of influence." 
<H5>  Islam Rules </H5>
  In Flemish circles, Milli Gorus is often described as a 
fundamentalistic movement. Efe is not happy with that. Not 
because the organization is not strictly religious, but because 
the term evokes associations with, as Efe puts it, "the 
troublemakers from the Mideast." 
  "We are no advocates of an Islamic state at all," Efe says. 
"On the contrary, we do not want the state to interfere in 
religion. That is why we are not in favor of so-called secular 
states such as Turkey and Belgium, either. Officially, the 
Church and the state are separated there, but in reality the 
state controls religion. This is also true for Belgium. The 
Catholics have a lot of influence in the state structure. Every 
year, an average of 1,200 Belgian francs [BFr] of tax money per 
citizen is appropriated for the official religions, against only 
BFr10 for every Muslim." 
  Efe immediately seizes the opportunity to eliminate several 
misconceptions. Such as the contacts with the Gray Wolves. "I 
am a member of the board, and I am unaware of any such contacts. 
It is sheer nonsense." An alleged move of the European 
headquarters from Cologne to Antwerp? "I had to laugh about 
it." Money from Saudi Arabia? "I wish it were true." 
  And how about the statements of the Turkish Milli Gorus 
leader Necmettin Erbakan? Last year in Genk, he said that Islam 
should determine the state's rule. Efe says: "Of course, I can 
hardly speak for Mr. Erbakan. I agree with some of his 
statements, I disagree with others. Erbakan is not familiar 
with the Belgian situation, and a statement like this is 
obviously not applicable to this country." [passage omitted] 
  Another tricky matter when it comes to Milli Gorus is 
politics. In Turkey, the Refah party, the Turkish Milli Gorus' 
political wing, aims at an Islamic organization of society. 
"However, in Belgium we do not interfere in politics," Efe 
says. "Our only political view is that we are in favor of 
voting rights for migrants. An Islam party is out of the 
question. This way, we would only play into the hands of the 
Flemish Bloc. But I must admit that Milli Gorus did ask its 
members to be as actively involved in existing political parties 
as possible."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "What the Parties Want To Achieve </F>
After 12 June; Five Election Platforms Under Eight Headings"] 
  [Text] This coming Sunday [12 June] when, depending on 
electoral district, voters will be presented with up to 12 
different lists of candidates for the new composition of the 
Chamber of Representatives, it will be important that the people 
are aware of each party's manifesto. In recent weeks, the 
public has been bombarded with a overflow of advertising 
material and statements about the programs of the various 
parties, both by the media and by post, which is not exactly the 
ideal way of gaining information. 
  To help our readers, we have therefore compiled, below, a 
comparative analysis of the individual election statements of 
the five relevant parties represented in the Parliament. While 
this comparison is by no means complete, it will nevertheless 
give an impression of what the various parties have to say on 
different topics. We have restricted ourselves to matters which 
are currently under discussion or which relate to fundamental 
social issues. 
<H5>  Christian Social People's Party [CSV] </H5>
  Income Tax: Thinks isolated tax benefits are possible, if 
necessary; stands by tax rehabilitation for married couples and 
the family as opposed to the unmarried and wants Luxembourg to 
keep the lowest indirect taxation in Europe. 
  Index: Is in favor of maintaining indexation in inflationary 
times. Prospect of negotiations with the social partners on 
index modulation for those on higher incomes if inflation soars. 
  Shorter Working Hours: Rejects legal reduction in working 
hours; this is more a matter for unions and management at 
company level. 
  Security: Wants to increase numbers of police by 200 and set 
up additional police stations. 
  Ecotaxes: Wants to introduce ecotaxes (on sewage 
purification, packaging, carbon dioxide products and special 
waste); for products and goods for which consumer alternatives 
exist, the ecotaxes should be entirely or partially immunized in 
the index. 
  Hospital Insurance: Has own model of compulsory hospital 
insurance (for domestic or hospital nursing). 
  Pensions: declares itself in favor of closer link between 
the 
two systems. Pensions should be further matched to the 
development of wages and prices and contribution rates frozen at 
their current level. 
  Protection of the Unborn Child: Wants to protect the unborn 
child. 
<H5>  Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg [LSAP] </H5>
  Income Tax: Wants to replace tax reduction for children by 
higher family allowance. 
  Index: Wants to preserve index but advocates a maximum 
income 
threshold for index adjustment. 
  Shorter Working Hours: In theory in favor of shorter working 
hours, which should chiefly be negotiated in a collective 
agreement. 
  Security: Wants to introduce planned law on increase in 
numbers in police force up to the year 2000. 
  Ecotaxes: Says yes to ecotaxes if they have a controlling or 
deterrent effect and are used for a specific purpose. 
  Hospital Insurance: Wants to introduce compulsory hospital 
insurance which insures all those in need of care. 
  Pensions: Aspires to the progressive adjustment of both 
systems, among other things by the introduction of a maximum 
pension. 
  Protection of the Unborn Child: Wants to introduce a limit 
on 
the timing of abortion. 
<H5>  Democratic Party [DP] </H5>
  Income Tax: Wants to lower direct taxation in a few isolated 
cases, make reclassification retrospective but increase indirect 
taxation. 
  Index: No statement. 
  Shorter Working Hours: No statement. 
  Security: Wants to increase security forces and improve 
their 
training and organization. 
  Ecotaxes: Supports the introduction of a system of 
specifically introduced ecotaxes. 
  Hospital Insurance: No formal statement; consideration 
should 
certainly be given to hospital insurance. 
  Pensions: Wants to critically analyze system of care for the 
elderly. Three principles govern: 1. Consideration of 
contributions paid in (for guaranteed minimum pension); 2. No 
overtaxation of working force people; 3. Long-term financial 
security. 
  Protection of the Unborn Child: No statement. 
<H5>  Green Alternative Party/Green Ecologist Initiative List </H5>
[GAP-GLEI] 
  Income Tax: Believe that there should be a system of more 
socially fair individual taxation. 
  Index: In favor of standard basic amounts for index changes. 
  Shorter Working Hours: Demand reduction in working hours to 
35 hours per week in the short term. 
  Security: Instead of one large central prison, want to 
create 
semi-open prisons. 
  Ecotaxes: Say that products which threaten the environment 
and health should be subjected to an ecotax to make them 
unattractive to manufacturers and consumers. 
  Hospital Insurance: Demand official hospital insurance, i.e. 
hospital allowance graded in accordance with hospital 
requirements. 
  Pensions: Advocate a standardized pension scheme which 
insures everyone in their old age, irrespective of whether they 
are in employment or not, and which prevents the loss of social 
achievements. 
  Protection of the Unborn Child: Want exemption from 
punishment for abortion. 
<H5>  Action Committee for Democracy and Pension Fairness [ADR] </H5>
  Income Tax: Declares itself in favor of an easing of the 
indirect tax burden and a stronger shift in the tax burden 
toward direct taxes. 
  Index: No statement. 
  Shorter Working Hours: Is in favor of voluntary reduction of 
the working week brought about by the social partners in 
companies. 
  Security: Demands increase in numbers of police and 
extension 
of the prison. 
  Ecotaxes: Would like to achieve a reduction in energy 
consumption through gradual introduction of a carbon dioxide tax. 
  Hospital Insurance: Is only in favor of hospital insurance 
(within the context of health insurance) if it precedes pension 
reform. 
  Pensions: Demands the introduction of universal insurance 
with equal rights and obligations for all those insured, in both 
the private and public sector, with the introduction of a 
minimum and maximum pension. 
  Protection of the Unborn Child: No statement.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Games Which Are Easy To See Through"] </F>
  [Text] In election times political parties are less 
inclined than ever to heap compliments on each other. Wooing 
the electorate notoriously leaves no holds barred, and political 
opponents come in for their share of the mud which is slung. 
  So, when politicians of differing hues lay into each other 
without pulling any punches, their behavior should not be 
examined too closely. Not all their expressions, descriptions, 
and modes of addressing each other should be taken too 
literally. Provided their comments are relevant, fair, and 
remain within the bounds of decency, there is no cause for 
complaint. 
  Unfortunately, though, the man is often played, rather than 
the ball. Personalities are dragged into the gutter. Untruths, 
half-truths, and sweeping statements are the currency. Utter 
cock-and-bull stories and deceit are used to portray the 
opposite camp in a bad light, while putting a halo round one's 
own head. 
  Anyone descending to these depths and hitting below the belt 
to gain attention not only abuses the rules of the game; he also 
shows himself lacking the very qualities required to engage in 
politics on behalf of the people. This is the opposite of 
politics understood primarily as serving mankind. The first 
stage of serving mankind is having respect for people, and 
consideration. Anyone indifferent to the personal dignity of 
others should not enter politics. 
  The 1994 election campaign now approaching its end cannot, 
thank God, be said to have degenerated into mudslinging. There 
have in the past been primaries when attempts were made to 
overcome political opponents not through factual arguments, but 
rather through insult, character assassination, and the like. 
In this respect, there seems to have been an improvement in 
this country's political life, which is to be definitely 
welcomed. 
  For the past five years, the Christian Social Party and the 
Socialists have governed the country together, as they 
previously did between 1984 and 1989. This was a coalition 
which at first glance was certainly not forged by love. The 
governmental alliance between the CSV [Christian Social People's 
Party] and the LSAP [Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg] was 
more of a marriage of convenience, based on the voters' verdict. 
The arithmetical balance of power between the coalition 
partners was decided by the voters. The two major parties 
committed themselves to a joint governmental program, which 
guaranteed our country's economic, social, and financial 
progress, while placing a new emphasis on social policy. 
  The CSV and LSAP have now been sharing power for ten years. 
They have achieved much, and managed to implement a great deal. 
Luxembourg's prosperity has perceptibly increased. We 
Luxembourgers are now better off than ever, as is confirmed by 
all available international statistics. Other countries envy us 
for this. 
  There is therefore a whiff of pettiness and meanness of 
spirit when a party such as the LSAP now seeks to take all the 
credit for the social achievements, the prosperity created, the 
protection of jobs, and the continued economic diversification 
during this period. But this is what it is doing when its 
leading candidate brazenly claims the CSV is planning a "massive 
authoritarian policy," and has ordered a "total halt on 
welfare." The conservatives, he claims, would not shrink from 
"interfering with the minimum wage, protection against wrongful 
dismissal, and working hours." 
  This move by the Socialists to distance themselves is 
schizophrenic. Are they so naive as to assume the voters are 
unaware which party is responsible for the major welfare 
legislation over the past 10 years? The reform of protection 
against wrongful dismissal, early retirement legislation, 
increase in minimum wages, tax reductions for low and medium 
wage earners, the substantial increase in housing assistance, 
improvements in family benefits, and the raising of students' 
grants, are without exception the work of CSV ministers. Why 
should these ministers do the exact opposite, after the election 
on 12 June 1994, of what they did after the 1984 and 1989 
elections? 
  The Socialists, taking stock of the 1984-1994 period, 
proudly 
offer such figures as the 83 percent increase in the welfare 
budget between 1988 and 1994, to 54.7 billion Luxembourg francs 
[LF], or the average 63.4 percent rise in pensions between 
December 1985 and December 1992, only 17.7 percent of which 
resulted from indexing. But all this is not just to the credit 
of the Socialists, as they would have the voters believe. Are 
these improvements not largely down to the budgetary policies of 
the finance and budget minister [Jean-Claude Juncker], who as is 
well-known belongs to the CSV? 
  The socialists also look back to 1990, claiming that the 
then 
average income of a Luxembourg family, after taking account of 
inflation, was 34 percent higher than in 1985, and that since 
1990 a great deal more has been done, including tax reform which 
for example raised tax thresholds from 29,400 francs per month 
(for a married couple with one child) to 59,700 francs in 1994. 
When the Socialists say this, they are again trying to persuade 
the voters that they should take the credit for it. But the 
voters know very well that the tax reform so trumpeted by the 
Socialists was the work of CSV Minister Jean-Claude Juncker. 
  We could go on listing further examples where the LSAP 
claims 
"There are no comparable achievements anywhere in the European 
Union." They are mainly the work of CSV ministers in the 
coalition government. Despite this, however, the LSAP's leading 
candidate proclaims to the country that the CSV's antagonism to 
social welfare must be resisted, and the LSAP must be the 
barrier against the CSV's attacks on the welfare state. It's 
enough to make you laugh!

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Liberals To Oppose Defense Cuts"] </F>
  [Text] The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] 
has great difficulty in accepting cuts of 300 million guilders 
[G] in the defense budget, a legacy of the present government. 
The VVD wants to reduce these cutbacks to zero. The PvdA 
[Labor Party] on the other hand wants to see even more defense 
cuts, of as much as G1.4 billion in all. 
  The three party leaders who are negotiating to form a 
"purple" coalition government comprising the PvdA, the VVD, and 
D66 [Democrats 66] are today to discuss defense policy. 
  In the election program, the Liberals position was that 
defense should be spared any cutbacks. But, since the present 
government is leaving behind it a "hole" of G5 billion, the VVD 
may also be unable to escape defense cuts. 
  In the election campaign, the VVD referred to this legacy of 
the present government as "[outgoing Finance Minister] Kok's 
hole." On calculating the cost of the election programs of all 
parties, the Central Planning Bureau concluded that all 
ministries would have to contribute to the G5 billion shortfall. 
The VVD later regretted that this "cheese-slicing method" also 
involved defense. 
  D66 also ran an election campaign in which defense was to be 
spared any cuts. But the Democrats have now reconciled 
themselves to a maximum of G600 million being cut from the 
defense budget. 
  The only conclusion reached by talks on public health, 
pursued by the three party leaders yesterday, is that there are 
to be no major changes to the system. PvdA leader Kok reported 
that the negotiators agreed that a "practical, businesslike 
approach" must be adopted to achieve costs management in the 
health sector. 
  Kok said that "no negotiating took place yesterday." 
Instead, 
the negotiators drew up a list of "major questions" to which the 
public health experts from the three parties must find an answer.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Tories were crushed almost into oblivion in 
five crucial by-elections early today during a night of shame 
and humiliation -- and possibly even peril -- for the Prime 
Minister and his Government. 
  They were forced into third place in three of the contests 
-- 
even in the so-called blue-chip stronghold of Eastleigh where 
the Liberal Democrats stampeded to a stunning victory with a 
9,000-plus majority. 
  Meanwhile, Labour sailed home comfortably in Bradford South, 
Dagenham, Newham North-East and Barking -- during what Jack 
Straw, their campaign chief, described as a "stunning night of 
victories" for his party. 
  But now, threatening rumblings are inevitable from 
malcontents on the Tory back-benches with the prospect of a 
dangerous challenge to John Major's leadership in the autumn 
looming even larger. 
  And what makes the outlook even bleaker for the Conservative 
leadership is the likelihood of another night of disaster and 
debacle on Sunday [12 June] when the European election results 
are announced. 
  All the signs are that the news from Europe will be as grim 
on Sunday, if not worse, for the Tories, as their performance 
overnight. 
  And although a clearly shocked Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory 
Party chairman, blamed the appalling results on mid-term blues, 
there is no doubt that the outcome was far more serious than he 
and other Conservative business managers had feared, even in 
their gloomiest moments. [passage omitted] 
  The lowest point in a night of misery was when their 
17,000-plus majority at Eastleigh was wiped out with ease by the 
jubilant Liberal Democrats, with 9,000 votes to spare. 
  It was the spectacular completion of an astonishing 
hat-trick 
by the Liberal Democrats since the general election, in 
capturing from the Government three supposedly impregnable Tory 
seats, the others being Christchurch and Newbury. 
  But even in Eastleigh, where Tories have ruled for decades, 
they plunged into third place behind Labour, the worst 
humiliation of all. 
  And in Barking and Bradford South, the Tories ended third, 
behind the Liberal Democrats, and with only a fraction of the 
vote they secured in these seats at the general election, both 
in terms of numbers and proportion. 
  It was probably only the eleventh-hour defection of the 
Liberal Democrat candidate at Newham North East which saved the 
Tories from plunging into third place there as well. 
  At Dagenham, the Tory vote slumped from 15,294 at the 
general 
election to a pitiful 2,130 today. 
  Despite his excuses, it is clear that Sir Norman believes 
that this is far more grave a matter for the Tories than mere 
mid-term unpopularity. 
  These results, added to the local government election 
calamity last month, and the likelihood of more of the same on 
Sunday from Europe, will be seen as clear evidence that the 
Conservatives are lodged deep in the hole which Chancellor 
Kenneth Clarke has grimly spoken about. 
  Now, it is almost certain that sometime next week the Prime 
Minister will call an urgent council of war, involving top party 
personnel, to devise a strategy to put the Conservatives in 
fighting trim again. 
  Mr Straw could not contain his glee at the results as Labour 
increased their majorities in the seats they already held, and 
added the ignominy of forcing the Tories into third place in 
Eastleigh. 
  He said: "We are delighted with the result at Eastleigh. To 
have pushed the Tories into third place is a complete 
vindication of our campaign. For the Tories it just gets worse 
and worse." 
  Mr Straw spoke of Labour's "stunning night of victories," 
adding, "the Tories have done abysmally." 
  Sir Norman appeared to be almost in a state of shock as the 
results unfolded. Dismay was written all over his face. 
  "These are very disappointing results," he told BBC TV. 
"There is no question about that. However, these are mid-term 
by-elections. We have had mid-term by-elections which have been 
bad before. But we have come back and won." 
  He added: ``The country has been bruised by the recession. 
Although a general recovery is taking place, it is not having 
the individual impact that it might be expected to have. 
  ``That is because of some of the measures that have had 
necessarily to be taken to ensure the recovery takes place -- 
the tax increases. 
  ``I believe we can win back these voters and that clearly is 
what we have got to put our minds to now.'' 
  The Tories had privately resigned themselves to losing 
Eastleigh. But the scale of the trouncing was far, far worse 
than they had envisaged, and even greater than the victorious 
Liberal Democrats had foreseen. [passage omitted] 
  All this leaves the Government with an overall majority of 
only 16 in the Commons -- with the Labour-held Monklands East 
by-election still to come. It requires only a handful more of 
Tory by-election defeats for the Government's majority to 
disappear altogether. 
  And the stark calculation by the BBC shows that if today's 
results were translated into a General Election, Labour would 
have a colossal Commons majority of 339 -- fielding 495 MPs 
against only 156 opposition members. And the Conservatives 
would be reduced to a pathetic rump of only 69. 
  The Tories now face the biggest struggle in their history if 
they are to catch up with and overtake in the period between now 
and the next general election.

  [Text] [Labuhn] Hans Stercken, CDU [Christian Democrtic 
Union] deputy and chairman of the Bundestag Foreign Affairs 
Committee, went to Iraq for political talks where yesterday he 
was also received by President Saddam Husayn. Before his 
departure Stercken said that his intention was to improve the 
preconditions for normalizing relations between Germany and 
Iraq. Meanwhile, Hans Stercken has moved on to Jordan's 
capital, Amman, where he is talking to us on the telephone. 
Good morning, Mr. Stercken. 
  [Stercken] Good morning, Mr. Labuhn. 
  [Labuhn] Can you tell us something about the detailed 
discussions that you had with Saddam Husayn? 
  [Stercken] Let me say first of all that I did not go there 
on 
behalf of anybody. I accepted a personal invitation and was 
accompanied by my colleague Dr. (Riedel), who supports a charity 
for Iraqi children in Munich. As far as the Iraqi side was 
concerned--and I had the opportunity of talking to virtually all 
the major politicians of that country--the talks revolved around 
the country's policy following the [eventual] lifting of the 
blockade. The future handling of this important position in the 
Middle East must not be an issue that is discussed by military 
circles. It is a political question. Neither is it an economic 
issue to be discussed by the many lobbyists in Baghdad hotels 
where you can meet businessmen from every corner of the globe 
who already discuss the policy following the lifting of the 
embargo. That is not politics. It was for that reason that I 
wanted to learn from the Iraqis themselves the kind of policy 
that they believe they (? should) pursue. 
  [Labuhn] What was the reply? 
  [Stercken] I believe that the lesson has been learned. I am 
saying this quite openly and clearly. I do not believe that any 
illusions are being cherished, not even concerning the 
determination of the West not to permit any such operations. 
Secondly, speculation that such an embargo might bring about 
political change in the country has not proved correct. I have 
talked to many people, including some who oppose the regime, who 
say that solidarity was never greater. If phosphorous is used 
to burn down wheat crops to complicate the food situation in 
that country, then one cannot expect the citizens to see that as 
a contribution toward their political freedom. Furthermore, 
there are many people who support the realization of Iraq's 
original intentions, to permit a multiparty system, and to 
finally change the Constitution as was decided at the end of the 
1980's, to set up an electoral system and an electoral law that 
would also apply to the future state president. All these are 
things that must be insisted upon now, and interestingly this 
was discussed with me openly and in great detail. 
  [Labuhn] Can Saddam Husayn's hints at political reforms in 
the country be taken seriously, Mr. Stercken? Can they be taken 
seriously, bearing in mind that this dictator has been ruling 
Iraq ruthlessly for decades? 
  [Stercken] Well, I would dearly like to see Westminster 
democracy prevail everywhere in the world. But my impression is 
that politics is always the art of the possible. How do we lead 
this important factor--for this is one of the most powerful Arab 
countries--back toward a civilized form of relations with the 
states in that region, with Turkey, Iran, and Kuwait. What are 
the factors that would induce change? Only from such changes 
can there emerge political change, political tolerance. What 
other options are there? After all, the intention of those 
businessmen who are already trying to feather their own nests is 
not to stabilize the situation by means of democracy. In fact, 
they will achieve the exact opposite. Hence, now is not the 
time for another quarrel over oil, but for a political dialogue 
that takes advantage of this hour in which the lessons of 
history have been learned to promote the development of this 
country in this spirit. 
  [Labuhn] Do you, Mr. Stercken, call for economic sanctions 
to 
be lifted as a precondition for the resumption of political 
dialogue between Iraq and the international community of states? 
  [Stercken] Well, I will talk about this with all those who 
have voiced numerous concerns about the UN resolutions. But I 
will also ask whether it is sensible to do it. For instance, 
there exists at present a willingness to conclude relevant 
accords with Kuwait. We really should proceed from the premise 
that without eliminating the causes of the present tension no 
development inside the country itself will take place. Too few 
people, and not only in Europe but also in the United States, 
are aware of that. When you have dealt with the Arab world for 
40 years you realize, for instance, that Saddam Husayn compares 
his incursion of Kuwait with incursions of Austria and 
elsewhere--although I should add that I had no intention of 
discussing this when talking about the future and the past--when 
he says that that too once belonged together. It is a different 
mentality. What is more, we did not spend time looking back on 
these German issues. The issue now is to avoid future conflicts 
and wars, and to ensure that this takes place on an appropriate 
and politically acceptable basis. 
  [Labuhn] In other words, you would advocate lifting UN 
economic sanctions in the foreseeable future. 
  [Stercken] What I advocate is the strictest adherence to the 
UN accords, namely, once the conditions have been met, then the 
sanctions should be lifted, but this must be linked to a 
political concept. We cannot allow this to degenerate into a 
military, economic, or oil issue. 
  [Labuhn] The Kurds in northern Iraq, Mr. Stercken, live in 
peace only because they can now live in a UN protected zone, 
virtually protected by allied troops. Likewise, the Shiites in 
the south of Iraq cannot be certain of survival. How can these 
minorities be protected when the aim is the normalization of 
relations between Iraq and other countries? 
  [Stercken] Well, I was shown the agreements with the Kurds 
that Barzani had intended to sign. It is interesting to note 
that Tariq Aziz, the former foreign minister and present deputy 
prime minister, said that the U.S. secretary of state was 
totally unaware that following the detailing of this accord, 
Barzani was invited to the United States where he was told that 
this would mean an end to all opportunities for cooperation with 
the United States. All this must be clarified. If this is 
indeed the case as claimed-- and I will discuss this with 
Barzani--then I can only say that they are no contribution 
toward a political solution of these issues. The Kurds do want 
to remain part of Iraq, and the autonomy treaty that they 
negotiated with Baghdad--I would say, looked at 
superficially--is indeed already a great help for the Kurds, and 
it is something that they agreed with the authorities in 
Baghdad. The question now is, if there is any doubt about this 
then guarantees must be given. But surely the path toward a 
solution should not be blocked in the mistaken assumption that a 
political change in Baghdad could be brought about in that way. 
That is discernible nowhere. Even the dissidents--as well as 
many journalists who made no attempt to disguise their 
attitude--have told me that in that way no political change 
could be brought about in Iraq. It must come about through 
dialogue, and on that point we count especially on the 
Europeans, saying again and again we count on the Germans, the 
French, and, interestingly, on the Spaniards. In fact, they 
seem to have anticipated Schwerin somewhat [sentence as heard]. 
I really do feel that serious thought should be given to this 
matter. After all, we do not want victory, but we want peace, 
reconciliation, and cooperation. 
  [Labuhn] Mr. Stercken, you are among the very few Western 
politicians who have had a face to face meeting with Saddam 
Husayn after the Gulf war. What impression did you have of him? 
  [Stercken] Very relaxed, very calm. I believe that the 
general situation in the country gives him no cause for any 
great worries. But I told him, do not be deceived, the issue is 
not just relations with your neighbors. Kaiser William II once 
spoke of many enemies, much honor, but Kuwait, Syria, 
Turkey--and then relations with Iran especially--must be added. 
If no easing, no relaxing of the situation comes about which, 
in any case, we cannot enforce everywhere by means of manpower 
but only on the basis of the status quo, and if there is no 
recipe, then it simply cannot be that [words indistinct] 
  [Labuhn] That was Hans Stercken, CDU deputy and chairman of 
the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee.

<F P=106> ["M.K"-initialed report: "Restrictions on Imports From </F>
China Restricted"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Four leading German economic associations 
-- the Foreign Trade Association of Retail Trade, the Federal 
Association of German Industry, the German Industrial and Trade 
Congress, and the Federal Association of German Wholesale and 
Foreign Trade -- are calling for an end to the restrictions on 
imports from China, and have also expressed disappointment with 
talks between the European Union Commission and a Chinese 
delegation that yielded no results. 
  Quotas of Chinese imports are even lower than in 1993, so 
that trade deals that have already been concluded can no longer 
be implemented. Last but not least, virtually no orders can be 
placed because it is not known how many import permits will be 
issued. This is endangering the existence of importers. All 
this can be blamed on EU errors in the management of quotas. 
The restrictive practice is jeopardizing export chances.

<F P=106> ["vwd"-attributed report: "Escape Routes to Europe Should </F>
Be Blocked"] 
  [Excerpt] During the forthcoming European Parliament 
consultations, Finance Minister Theo Waigel wants to attain 
political agreement on the gradual attainment of a joint 
European tax rate on interest rates during Germany's duty 
presidency of the European Union [EU]. Only with a coordinated 
tax rate can the outflow of German capital to other countries be 
prevented, a phenomenon that has been observed ever since the 
introduction of tax on interest rates in Germany. 
  In an interview with this writer, Waigel said the subject 
will not be finally settled while Germany holds the presidency, 
"but we will probably reach political decisions that can be 
implemented. One cannot place excess demands on others. 
Negotiations on this matter can be continued under France's EU 
presidency." 
  Waigel spoke out in favor of pursuing the principle of 
subsidiarity. He said there is a compulsory tax on interest 
rates in every EU country, but each country applies a different 
tax system. "Things should remain that way," said Waigel. "All 
we are concerned with is preventing a citizen of one country 
from evading this tax by going to another country. Such an 
evasion would not lie in any country's interests." The finance 
minister spoke out in favor of including as many OECD countries 
as possible in a suitable agreement. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial by Josef Joffe: "Clinton's Crucial Test"] </F>
  [Text] Bill Clinton has never been good at foreign policy; 
his statesmanship is limited to saying "yes," "no," or "perhaps" 
-- and this in quicker succession than would be advisable in the 
interests of credibility. Bosnia, Haiti, Somalia -- these three 
case studies of "postmodern" foreign policy following the Cold 
War reveal a pattern showing neither priorities nor interests. 
"Anything goes," seems to be the motto of this President who 
takes less pleasure in foreign policy than any of his 
predecessors since the isolationist twenties. 
  But now Clinton has reached the border of postmodern foreign 
policy, and this border goes right across the Korean Peninsula. 
On the other side of this border is North Korea, the last 
Stalinist fossil, which makes even Castro's Cuba appear a model 
of an open society. Kim Il-song, the 82-year-old permanent 
dictator, has confronted Clinton with an impudent nuclear 
challenge that could develop into a "definite crisis" of his 
presidency -- like the Cuban missile crisis in the second year 
of Kennedy's presidency. 
  For two years now, Kim Il-song has staged a nuclear gamble 
according to the motto: "Where is the bomb?" Inspectors of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are hoaxed or locked 
out, while Pyongyang threatens to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, which would abruptly mark the end of 
any inspection. In the center of the most recent escalation are 
8,000 fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor core. In other words, 
if the inspectors cannot access the rods, they cannot say how 
much plutonium has been "bred" and how much bomb-grade material 
can be extracted and secretly put aside following the 
cooling-off phase (approximately a month). By rough estimates, 
the rods are good for five or six atom bombs. 
  Filling the cup to the brim, Pyongyang simply reacted to the 
United States' threats of sanctions by stating: "Sanctions will 
promptly mean war, and war will be merciless." Clinton cannot 
leave this poker game now to deal with the health reform at home 
or the financial trouble in which his wife, Hillary, is involved 
in connection with the "Whitewatergate" affair. What is at 
stake is not just the United States' credibility, but also a 
pillar of the postwar order -- the nonproliferation regime, 
which has ensured for more than 30 years that the number of 
official nuclear powers does not exceed five, and the number of 
unofficial ones does not exceed two. Some would-be bomb 
builders (such as Sweden or South Africa) gave up, while others 
(Iraq) were forced to do so. 
  The crux of the matter is this: If North Korea goes to the 
end of the road upon which it embarked in 1989 and which it has 
continued since then, this would mark the end of containment. 
The signal would be that the United States as a superpower and 
the "international community" (meaning China, Russia, Britain, 
and France) are not even able to enforce an interest that unites 
them all -- nuclear nonproliferation. Those waiting for such a 
signal are no lambs -- Libya, Iran, Iraq, Algeria, Pakistan. In 
addition, a North Korean bomb would entail a South Korean and a 
Japanese bomb. 
  Clinton is not to be envied. His presumptive allies are no 
allies. China suddenly talks about "blood friendship" with 
North Korea and even strictly rejects any sanctions. Russia 
wants a conference of the big powers, which would, however, be 
intended to serve its own status rather than as punishment for 
Pyongyang. Japan is afraid, and South Korea hesitates, even 
though they are both threatened most by Kim Il-song's bomb. By 
the way, sanctions do not make sense with a country that has 
adopted autarchy as its policy principle. There are only one 
and a half levers. The half-lever is the sum of $1 billion that 
Koreans in Japan transfer to their home country. The whole 
lever consists of the oil products (75 percent of its total 
demand) that North Korea buys from China. No gasoline, no war 
-- however, Beijing will not use this lever. 
  Would "bribery" help, meaning economic aid or diplomatic 
recognition? Hardly, because, first, relevant offers have long 
been on the table, and, second, the construed picture of a 
hostile outside world is the breeding ground on which the 
stone-age dictatorship lives. Those who are serious about the 
containment of atom bombs must face a sad reality, which 
requires military countermoves. 
  A minimum is the demonstrative enforcement of the United 
States' presence in South Korea and the Japanese Sea. If Kim 
Il-song threatens war, he must know that a war would fall back 
on him and would destroy him. This would at least be helpful 
for an assessment of the reality, of which even dictators are 
capable. Under this umbrella, Clinton could prove that he is 
able to concentrate on what is essential in foreign policy. 
Combined with persistence, U.S. resolve could even work 
diplomatic miracles and could forge an alliance among Beijing, 
Moscow, Seoul, and Tokyo, which would show Kim Il-song that he 
is isolated. One thing is, however, impossible -- to wring 
one's hands and look on as, at the threshold to the third 
millennium, Korea opens the door to a world in which any 
second-class dictator would play with the bomb.

<F P=106> [Claire Trean report: "Bill Clinton, the European"] </F>
  [Text] It has been rare to see Francois Mitterrand so 
jovial in a television performance, and as relaxed in the 
presence of a U.S. President, as was the head of state on 
Tuesday, 7 June during the interview he granted in the evening 
to the three main French TV stations along with his U.S. guest. 
In Clinton, Mitterrand has clearly at last found a U.S. 
President after his own heart. 
  There was a sure sign: On at least two occasions in two 
days, the president of the Republic permitted himself to say 
"let's go!" [previous words in English] in public. He would 
never have allowed himself this sacrilege to the French-speaking 
cause in the presence of George Bush, and even less in that of 
Ronald Reagan. Mitterrand was visibly relaxed when he received 
Clinton on Tuesday. Not that his old prejudices against the 
United States have completely disappeared. But now that the end 
is approaching of a presidency whose only principal topic in the 
foreign policy area has been the strengthening of Europe and its 
emancipation vis-a-vis the United States, could Mitterrand have 
dreamed of any better U.S. President than this one, who came to 
France with calls for a "stronger" Europe? Could he have hoped 
for a more flattering image than this double portrait which 
appeared on TV screens on Tuesday? An image of himself serene, 
smiling but tenacious, and the leader of the leading world 
power, youthful, falsely inexperienced, giving the appearance of 
malleability at his sides? 
  Mitterrand's words on Tuesday evening would not have to be 
stretched too much to make him say that the United States has 
finally given itself a Socialist president. A president "who 
should allow us, within the GATT framework, to introduce a 
social clause which would lead to the prohibition of child labor 
and forced labor by prisoners, and which would make 
recommendations with regard to trade union activities so that 
they can no longer be made subject to harassment or 
prohibition," Mitterrand said. In this fight for universal 
social progress, "it is Bill Clinton's United States and France" 
which were at the forefront, Mitterrand insisted. Clinton 
played the game, notably by recalling the social preoccupations 
of his administration faced with the problems caused by the 
extreme "flexibility," as they say, of the U.S. labor market. 
Still, one could not believe one's ears, remembering 
Mitterrand's past diatribes against U.S. liberalism and, in 
particular, his warnings to the former communist countries in 
East Europe against a dangerous fascination for the United 
States. 
  Nor could one believe one's ears when the president of the 
Republic stated that the U.S. commitment in Bosnia was "full and 
complete," as if it was a self-evident truth which he had never 
doubted. 
  Forgotten, therefore, are the repeated calls on the United 
States to accept their responsibilities and stop giving lessons 
when they were not present in the field alongside French blue 
helmets in Bosnia; also forgotten is the sarcasm and bitterness 
against the air strikes advocated for so long by the Americans, 
who only consented to show firmness at a very high altitude. 
  But U.S. policies in Bosnia have indeed changed, and 
Mitterrand's praise on Tuesday was addressed to Washington's 
current commitment to a negotiated settlement and against 
lifting the arms embargo. The fact that [French Foreign 
Minister] Alain Juppe managed to obtain this turnaround from the 
U.S. Administration last month was no doubt related to France's 
U-turn three months earlier, when it proved to be the United 
States' most solid partner in NATO at the time of the ultimatum 
to Serb forces in Sarajevo. But on Tuesday evening, Mitterrand 
did not allude to this episode, which constituted a break with 
presidential policy. 
  U.S. policies have also changed toward the European Union in 
general and France in particular. But the major factor in this 
detente, as Clinton let it be understood on Tuesday, was the 
unblocking of the GATT negotiations right after the Balladur 
government took office. These negotiations had poisoned 
transatlantic relations for years. 
  Finally U.S. policies have changed with regard to security 
in 
Europe and the responsibility it to be assumed by the Europeans 
themselves. The U.S. Administration has largely abandoned its 
mistrust, still maintained under Bush, toward European defense 
projects and the initiatives aimed at undermining NATO, which it 
ascribed to Paris back then. But should we simply rejoice, or 
is there also some reason for concern? We should have no 
delusions: The strong Europe which Clinton is advocating in the 
security field is in line with the current U.S. policy in favor 
of withdrawal and against direct intervention, while allowing 
the United States not ot lose too much in terms of influence. 
Mitterrand's policies were aimed at the large-scale 
redistribution of the Euro-Atlantic cards which is being called 
for in this field. But the dice are far from being cast: It 
will take years for Europe to set up its own security system and 
to define its role with regard to the East European countries 
and Russia, in particular, thus making it possible to determine 
the respective shares of the Americans and Europeans in it. 
  More generally, the conflicts which are currently raging in 
various parts of the world raise the question, beyond the 
efficiency of the United Nations, of the willingness of Western 
countries to intervene in outside theatres. Mitterrand and 
Clinton are the leaders of the two single Western countries 
currently likely to enter these theatres. The least one can say 
is that their declarations about Rwanda on Tuesday are hardly a 
cause for optimism.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by Jean-Michel </F>
Lamy; place and date not given: "Juppe: `No' to Europe as Mere 
Free Trade Area"--first paragraph is LES ECHOS introduction] 
  [Text] Just three days before the elections, Alain Juppe, 
foreign minister and secretary general of the RPR [Rally for the 
Republic], stated his beliefs with regard to Europe. France can 
make its voice heard in Brussels, he said, citing the example of 
GATT. He reaffirmed the objective of a single currency and 
called for a return to narrow fluctuation bands within the EMS 
[European Monetary System]. With a view to the reform of 
Community institutions planned for 1996, he proposed, among 
other things, extending the term of the presidency of the 
European Council. With regard to the major issue of enlargement 
to include the countries of the East, the minister pleaded for a 
plan for the gradual integration of candidate members, which he 
listed. Alain Juppe clearly opted for a more efficient and more 
democratic European Union [EU], rejecting the possibility of 
Europe becoming a mere free trade area. 
  [Lamy] Is Europe not starting on a downhill slope? 
  [Juppe] The impression of "Europessimism" that seems to 
prevail in Europe is not shared abroad. The EU maintains a 
strong power of attraction, since numerous states want to join 
it. It is respected not only by the United States but also by 
Russia and Japan. And the image of it in Third World countries 
is that of a fortress rather than of a ship adrift. This being 
so, what is the source of the skepticism that is being 
expressed, especially in connection with the campaign for the 
election of the European Parliament? First, from the feeling 
that successive enlargements of the Community have taken place 
to the detriment of its coherence. Second, from the fact that 
the complexity and weight of EU institutions are now so great as 
to paralyze them. 
  Last, Europe is accused of having failed to provide a 
convincing response to the concerns of Europeans: the struggle 
against unemployment and both internal and external security. 
These criticisms, often justified, must be answered. There is 
no shortage of ideas. 
  [Lamy] How would you evaluate the functioning of the Council 
of Ministers in Brussels? Can France make its voice heard in 
them? 
  [Juppe] My evaluation is clear. Yes, France can make its 
voice heard, as is shown by GATT and Bosnia. But we can do 
better. After 15 months' experience, I think that two kinds of 
improvement can be made. The first is the more simple one: It 
concerns working methods. Everyone can see that the practice of 
systematic "roundtables" consumes a great deal of time -- at 
least two hours among Twelve, perhaps four or five hours if the 
Union some day has 25 members. Some measures of a practical 
nature can be envisaged: to settle more issues at the level of 
the Council of Permanent Representatives (senior officials 
representing France in Brussels), to increase written 
procedures, and also, as the French Government has suggested, to 
organize more frequent meetings of the ministers responsible for 
European affairs. 
  The second class of reforms must aim to improve the 
efficiency of the decisionmaking process. To this end we should 
consider extending the term of the presidencies, creating one or 
more deputy presidencies, or increasing the personnel or 
resources of the Secretariat General of the Council (and thus 
also extending the services of the Commission). We will have 
these suggestions in mind during preparations for the 
intergovernmental conference in 1996. 
  [Lamy] According to the public, Bosnia illustrates Europe's 
impotence to a grotesque degree. What is France's role? 
  [Juppe] Before talking about Europe's impotence, let us 
recall first that it provides the largest share of humanitarian 
aid, which has made it possible to save hundreds of thousands of 
lives over the past two years. This is by no means negligible! 
It is also the Europeans who have deployed the most blue 
helmets in Bosnia. Last, it is Europe that has proposed the 
only plan for a political settlement of the conflict, and this 
plan, having been almost accepted by all sides in December, 
still remains on the table. 
  [Lamy] France has always performed a guiding role among the 
Twelve: It is by far the largest contributor of troops, ahead 
of Britain; it was the initiator, with Germany, of the EU peace 
plan; and it was behind all the political and military measures 
that made it possible to drive back the Serbs: the sanctions 
against the Belgrade regime, the establishment of safe havens, 
and the ultimatum to Sarajevo. In other words, we have no cause 
to feel ashamed about what we have done, and we must not relax 
our efforts to achieve a political settlement, which is the only 
possible solution to this conflict. During President Clinton's 
recent visit to Paris, I noted that the Americans and French now 
hold the same stance: We must do our utmost to persuade the 
three communities to conclude a peace agreement before the 
summer, on the basis of the 13 May Geneva declaration. This is 
a considerable accomplishment for French diplomacy! 
  [Lamy] What role do you envisage for the WEU [Western 
European Union], the body responsible for defense? Could we 
envisage the Eurocorps, as it is now, intervening in the medium 
term? 
  [Juppe] It is the destiny of the WEU to merge with the EU 
sooner or later. European defense depends both on a 
strengthening of the effort made by the Europeans themselves 
ands on maintaining a strong trans-Atlantic link. This is why 
France pleaded successfully at the latest NATO summit for the 
latter to be able, in some instances, to place its resources 
under WEU command. France and Germany are determined to pursue 
this path, as shown by the latest Franco-German summit, which 
achieved in particular a very notable advance on the issue of 
space observation satellites, which Europe will need in order to 
have its own strategic analysis capability. 
  The increased strength of the Eurocorps, to which Belgium, 
Spain, and Luxembourg also contribute, is a priority. If, as I 
hope, Germany succeeds in resolving the constitutional problem 
associated with troop deployment abroad, the Eurocorps will 
grant Europe the military wing that it now lacks. There are 
other major projects under way, such as the establishment of an 
aeronaval force with Spain and Italy, which will contribute to 
the same objective. 
  [Lamy] How are we to deal with an increasingly pressing 
demand on the part of the countries of the East to join the EU? 
How do you intend to handle it? 
  [Juppe] This is a major challenge for Europe in the years 
ahead. We cannot act as though nothing had happened in 1989, as 
though the countries of Central and East Europe had not carried 
out a peaceful revolution, restored democracy, and opened up to 
the market economy. For almost five years France has argued for 
an enlarged Europe at last free from the divisions of the Cold 
War. If we disappoint those countries' expectations, we risk 
both casting them back toward nationalist temptations and 
prompting them to return to their former options. 
  This is why the French Government, in full agreement with 
Germany, believes that the EU must be extended to the countries 
of East Europe. This, moreover, was the conclusion reached by 
the European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993. 
  So it is not the principle of enlargement that is in 
dispute, 
but the means of achieving it. It is necessary, first, to draw 
up a list limiting the number of countries involved: These are 
the countries of Central and East Europe and the three Baltic 
countries, to which Slovenia could be added. Second, the 
adherence of new member states must not entail a dilution of 
European building. As Chancellor Kohl clearly stated at the news 
conference after the Franco-German summit at Mulhouse, we refuse 
to allow Europe to become a mere free trade area. So before 
moving ahead, we must work, with a view to the intergovernmental 
conference in 1996, for a thorough revision of the institutions, 
to make the Union more efficient and more democratic. 
Furthermore, an enlarged Europe must enjoy stability; its 
members must settle their disputes like good neighbors: The 
stability pact, work on which is due to finish at the beginning 
of 1995, provides them with a suitable framework for doing so. 
  Last, imagination will have to be displayed to bring 
together 
within the same Union countries whose levels of development and 
economic conditions are still very different. This is why we 
are considering a plan for the gradual integration of the 
candidates for membership. We have started to work in this 
direction by associating the countries of central and East 
Europe in terms of foreign and security policy and by granting 
them, on the basis of a Franco-German proposal, the status of 
associate membership in the WEU. This organization's council 
spoke out favorably in this regard at its 9 May session. 
  [Lamy] The other major anxiety concerns Europe's inability 
to 
create jobs and to defend itself commercially. Is the record of 
GATT negotiations a positive one, on balance? 
  [Juppe] Europe has created fewer jobs in recent years than 
the United States or Japan. The first reason for this has to do 
with the weak growth -- actually negative in 1993 -- that we 
have experienced since 1990. Some degree of optimism in this 
regard is justified by the fact that all the institutes forecast 
growth of 1.6 percent for 1994 and growth above 2 percent in 
1995. Second, there are structural obstacles in Europe to the 
creation of jobs. Brussels last December embarked, on the basis 
of the Commission's white paper and of the national 
contributions that it received, on a very extensive program 
designed to stimulate job creation. It involves on the one hand 
facilitating major infrastructure networks such as the new 
eastern high-speed train service, which is one of the 10 
priority projects that will be approved at the European Council 
in Corfu. The other objective is to establish EU actions in the 
field of education, increased flexibility of labor, and the 
development of proximity services. 
  As for the GATT negotiations, I think, as I have had 
occasion to say several times, that it is extremely positive. 
Without going back over it in detail, I will mention its 
crucial achievements -- increased openness to third markets, the 
safeguarding of the Common Agricultural Policy, which was 
threatened by the draft Blair House agreement; the recognition 
of cultural exception; the establishment of the World Trade 
Organization [WTO]; and the broaching of new issues, such as the 
environment or different levels of social protection. Of 
course, we must remain vigilant with regard to the 
implementation of the GATT agreement, which must be ratified by 
all sides before their implementation in 1995. 
  France believes that the establishment of the WTO offers 
real 
chances of combating the unilateral trade policies which 
profoundly affect international trade. Moreover, we are now 
better equipped to respond in the event of a continuation of 
such practices. On our initiative, on 15 December 1993, at the 
same time as it approved the results of the Uruguay round, the 
EU strengthened its own instruments of trade policy. 
  [Lamy] Do you think that the credibility of the objective of 
a single European currency has been enhanced now? 
  [Juppe] This remains the objective. In order to achieve it 
we must first strengthen the convergence of the European 
economies. In 1993 we succeeded in surmounting a serious 
monetary crisis thanks to close cooperation with Germany. We 
must now make the best use of the second stage of economic and 
monetary union [EMU], which began on 1 January 1994 with the 
establishment of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt. 
This stage must be marked in particular by a strengthening of 
coordination between central banks, further development of the 
public and private use of the ECU and a coordinated reduction of 
interest rates. 
  We must also establish narrower fluctuation bands among 
European currencies. If these objectives are achieved, the 
transition to the third stage of EMU, that is, the single 
currency, will be within our reach. 
  [Lamy] You mentioned a Europe of "variable solidarity". Is 
it enough? Is it not necessary to envisage a proper reform of 
EU institutions, a new founding act among the real advocates of 
political union? 
  [Juppe] First, I would like to point out that "variable 
solidarity" is not a new idea. It is the principle adopted 
within the framework of the EMS, in connection with industrial 
cooperation (the Airbus and Arianespace are two examples), but 
also in the field of research, where some programs -- such as 
JET [Joint European Torus], which has permitted considerable 
progress to be made in thermonuclear fusion -- do not involve 
all members states and are conducted in association with third 
states. 
  The WEU, whose task it is to formulate a common defense 
policy, does not comprise all the members of the EU. And the 
Eurocorps, which is the precursor of common armed forces, 
permits those who so wish to associate their efforts on a 
voluntary basis. The larger the EU grows, the more this kind of 
process will be necessary, because in a community of 20-25 
members not everyone can do everything together, nor at the same 
pace. This is by no means incompatible with the idea of a 
"tough kernel" of member states wanting to establish together a 
very advanced union. This is the main significance of 
Franco-German cooperation, the vitality of which has just been 
demonstrated again by the Mulhouse summit. 
  Let us not labor under any delusions: The 1996 
intergovernmental conference cannot content itself with what I 
would call technical superficial adjustments; it must examine 
matters in depth and, to use your expression, result in a new 
founding pact guided by our vision of the Europe of the year 
2000. A Europe determined to meet the two great challenges that 
face our societies -- employment and peace. France is ready to 
proceed further along this path.

<F P=106> [Report by Jacques Amalric: "When Clinton Reassures the </F>
French"] 
  [Text] Is the one-month cease-fire signed in Geneva by the 
different sides in the Bosnian conflict a result of the Clinton 
effect? This was the question being asked yesterday evening in 
Paris, 24 hours after the U.S. President had taken a clear 
position -- in public at the National Assembly but also in 
private in talks with [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur, 
[President] Francois Mitterrand, and [Foreign Minister] Alain 
Juppe -- in favor of the European peace plan. This plan 
provides for a division of the territory of Bosnia between the 
Serbs and the Croatian-Muslim alliance (created under the aegis 
of the United States). No one dared answer the question in the 
affirmative, but some senior figures were hoping firmly that the 
cease-fire would not "be broken nearly as soon as it was 
signed," like so many others in the former Yugoslavia. 
  This glimmer of hope was largely due to the determination 
shown by Clinton during his stay in Paris. "His declarations 
before the deputies were very clear," it was said in Juppe's 
entourage. "But his resolution was clearer still during the 
talks in the Hotel Matignon [office of the prime minister 
office] and the Elysee palace [office of the president]." 
Reliable sources confirmed that Bosnia was the only topic of 
the discussions at the Elysee palace, bringing together the two 
presidents, Juppe, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
various staffers. This was at President Clinton's request; he 
was virtually the only one to talk for the U.S. side and showed 
an excellent grasp of such a complex subject. "We were talking 
with a politician," it was said on the French side, "whereas 
when we talk with State Department officials, we have the 
impression of dealing with ideologues who only think in terms of 
good and evil." 
  This sneer obviously refers to Warren Christopher, who four 
months ago reproached the Europeans for supporting an "immoral 
and unjust" plan and confusing "aggressors and aggressed." On 
Tuesday [7 June] in the Elysee he is reported to not have said a 
word, whereas Clinton proved that he had "understood the 
catastrophic scenario" which would result from lifting the arms 
embargo on Bosnia. Clinton gave the impression that he was not 
prepared to allow the Muslims to increase their territorial 
claims much beyond the 51 percent accorded by the European peace 
plan to the Croatian-Muslim federation. 
  The solution could lie in turning a number of urban centers 
currently occupied by the Serbs, but where a large number of 
Muslims lived before the hostilities started, into "gray" zones 
under UN control. Juppe put forward the idea in an interview 
published today in LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. Juppe said in the 
interview that "there is a chance" that the peace plan will 
work. "The Croats accept the Geneva plan. The Serbs accept the 
Geneva plan," the foreign minister said, "I think that the 
Muslims will accept the 51/49 proportion, as they did last 
December in Geneva, if we define another 4-5 percent of `gray 
zones.'" 
  In this interview, given before Clinton came to Paris, Juppe 
also attacked those who accused him of "capitulation." "With 58 
percent, we would be respecting, they say, international 
morality, right, and justice," he said. "But with 51 percent, 
we would be blamed with capitulation and the acceptance of an 
ethnic division! Does the difference between good and evil lie 
in 7 percent more or less land?" Although nothing allows 
Juppe's prudent optimism to be taken at face value as yet, it is 
certain that Clinton's determination has strengthened him. More 
will be known in the coming days, when the contact group, which 
includes the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, 
and Germany, will look again at the subject of territorial 
partition, which was not covered in the agreement signed 
yesterday. This contact group could very soon be enlarged to 
include Italy, and if all goes more or less well, France hopes 
to achieve a meeting of the contact group countries by the end 
of the month, but at the ministerial level this time. 
  Another crucial date, if no solution is in sight in the 
short 
term, is that of the summit meeting of the main industrialized 
countries, the G-7, to be held in Naples from 8 to 10 July. The 
main powers involved in seeking a negotiated settlement will be 
gathered there: the United States, the UK, France, Germany, and 
also Italy and above all Russia. It has been decided that Boris 
Yeltsin, whose country is theoretically responsible for putting 
pressure on the Serbs, will take part in the political part of 
the summit. For France, the Naples meeting is particularly 
important. It is, Juppe said, a sort of deadline after which 
Paris will reexamine the presence of its contingent in Bosnia. 
A way of keeping pressure on negotiations which will have many 
more low points yet.

<F P=106> [Report by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux report: "Inter-Army, </F>
Inter-Allied Defense -- A French-Style Pentagon"] 
  [Text] Who could honestly state that the Armed Forces are 
not continually trying to adapt to the new strategic challenges, 
threats, risks, and conflicts resulting from the current 
post-Cold War times? Assuredly not the military, who have seen 
new reforms introduced year after year. For example, the Army 
has been through Mr. Chevenement's "Army 2000" plan, then Mr. 
Joxe's "Format 1997" plan, before recently embarking on project 
"21," where "21" stands for 21st century. 
  There is not always time to implement such reforms in their 
original format as changes are routinely introduced beforehand. 
The most recent example is the creation of two joint commands 
(EMIA's), one for "European Operations" planning, and the other 
for "Foreign Operations" planning. Established by a ministerial 
decree signed Pierre Joxe and dated 10 February 1993, they were 
scheduled to become gradually operational between July 1993 and 
the summer of 1994. However, even before this deadline expired, 
a new ministerial decree signed Francois Leotard and published 
in the 1 June JOURNAL OFFICIEL has merged them into a single 
"Joint Command for Operational Planning" (EMIAPO). 
<H5>  Better Management </H5>
  Substance-wise, the difference is hardly noticeable, as it 
was decided from the start that both EMIA's would work side by 
side in the same building located in an Air Force base in Creil 
(Oise). Officially handed over to the Armed Forces on Friday [3 
June], the specially designed building is in the shape of a 
cross, with each EMIA being allocated two of its arms, while 
their respective chiefs occupy the central area. A single 
Operational Planning Command headed by Major General Bernard 
Janvier: This attempt at simplification will lead to better 
management. Such a move had been envisioned from the start, but 
had been deferred in order to smooth out the transition and 
avoid ruffling a few feathers. However, it will not entail 
reduced personnel costs. By summer, the total human resource 
figure will reach 200 individuals (four senior officers, 83 
officers, 53 non-commissioned officers, 14 volunteers, and 45 
draftees). Fifty percent of the officers belong to the Army. 
  However, it will lead to better coordination between the 
"European Operations" and "Foreign Operations" teams, whose 
deputy chiefs are Air Force Major General Jean-Pierre Job and 
Rear Admiral Francois de Longueau Saint Michel. 
  The main change, which goes way beyond this 1994 amendment 
to 
the Joxe plan of 1993, is that the establishment of this 
Inter-Army Command (twin-headed, then single-headed) has brought 
together two already existing planning commands, which 
previously operated independently, one from Metz, under the 
chief of the First Army (now broken up), and the other from 
Maisons-Laffite, controlled by the Rapid Intervention Force 
(FAR) commanding officer. Worse, neither of these was an 
"inter-army" command. 
  The Gulf War and subsequent UN operations in Cambodia, 
Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia showed that the participation 
of our Armed Forces required increasing coordination among the 
services. Indeed, the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the 
Military Police, and the health and fuel services must plan such 
operations together, as they must carry them out together. 
  The reform that established EMIAPO was designed and actively 
implemented by Admiral Jacques Lanxade in his capacity as chief 
of staff. It must be viewed as one of the aspects of a 
reorganization that affects the whole range of means needed to 
carry out an operation. 
  A few months ago [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard, who 
noted that in the past his ministry had been called "War 
Ministry," then "Ministry of the Armed Forces," before becoming 
"National Defense Ministry" and, more recently, "Defense 
Ministry," mentioned the (rather remote) possibility of a future 
"Peace Ministry." In the meantime and parallel to this 
evolution, however, as new crises and conflicts crop up at an 
increasing rate, functions such as "military intervention," 
"operations", "crisis management," and "warfare" become ever 
more concentrated in the hands of the chief of staff. 
  True, the chief of staff controls the Joint Operations 
Center 
(COIA) in charge of all national or international operations 
involving French soldiers. And to perform such "real-time", 
24-hours monitoring, the chief of staff/COIA tandem needs as 
much firsthand information as possible. 
  Thus, in three years time, a sort of French-style "Pentagon" 
has been created. Not in the field, as this would be too 
costly, but at the conceptual and decisionmaking level. In 
addition to the EMIAPO, it places the Military Intelligence 
Command (DRM) and the Special Operations Command (COS) under the 
control of the Armed Forces Chief of Staff. Of course, it 
maintains close contacts with the "force reserves" of the three 
armies. 
  This structure would not be fully operational without a NATO 
dimension being added to the integration of the services. While 
General de Gaulle's 1966 decision of leaving NATO's Integrated 
Command remains valid, close relations have been developing with 
NATO commands. Either between the Armed Forces Chief of Staff 
and NATO commands through French military missions, or between 
EMIAPO and the planning groups of the various NATO commands. 
Such relations are not exclusive. The Inter-Army Command 
includes liaison officers sent by our NATO partners. It also 
exchanges information with the WEU [Western European Union] 
Planning Group. Thus, in times of peace, networks are being 
woven that prepare the potential participation of Inter-Army 
Command components in NATO or WEU operations.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Philippe Tesson] </F>
  [Text] Paradox: It was from the mouth of a foreigner, 
namely the President of the United States, that Europe just 
heard the mobilizing language which it is so cruelly lacking in 
this time of self-doubt. Bill Clinton, whose trip to France 
will leave an unexpected mark and who surprised people with his 
determination, skill, and charisma, stressed his strength in a 
speech before the National Assembly to express his faith in 
Europe, to point the way to its future, and to offer it American 
support. Would it be an offense to the memory of Kennedy to 
speak of a new frontier regarding the grand European design 
evoked by Clinton? At the very least, the U.S. President had 
pledged he would give impetus to a cause which we wrongly felt 
had been relegated to secondary standing on the White House's 
list. 
  Of course, allowances must be made. Clinton could not come 
to Europe without boosting Europe. The specific circumstances 
of his visit were doubly binding on him. Lastly, his commitment 
to Europe was not given free of charge. He is actually 
responding to American interests, and it will be no coincidence 
if the "Europe according to Clinton" closely follows these 
interests. Indeed, such a Europe will not be to the taste of 
all the various attitudes found in Europe. He has such a 
pragmatic vision that we will grant him the mental reservation 
of seeing Europe as the Trojan Horse of American interests 
[sentence as received]. Is he not actually preempting this 
suspicion by coming out in favor of a European defense identity 
and by hoping for a strong Europe alongside a strong America? 
  It is up to us, Europeans, to assess the common aspects and 
overlapping between our interests and those of the United 
States. Who would contest Clinton's analysis of the necessary 
development of a market economy in the countries of East Europe, 
and who would contest that Europe has a dominating role to play 
in this strategy? In this respect, Clinton taught us a good 
lesson yesterday. Have we not wasted enough time? Similarly, 
who would deny that Europe and the United States have a joint 
responsibility to export democracy? 
  Yesterday, Clinton set us back on the track of our European 
obligation. We should at least recall this lesson drawn from 
encouraging words which -- even if they have some underlying 
reservations -- should lead us to overcome our disillusion.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance deputy Mirko Tremaglia, </F>
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Chamber of 
Deputies, by Federico Bianchessi in Rome; date not given: 
"Tremaglia: `We Shall Return to Africa'" -- first two 
paragraphs are LA VOCE introduction] 
  [Text] Mirko, and the world...trembles [pun on 
interviewee's surname]. He wears neither the fascist uniform of 
coarsely woven woolen cloth nor a black shirt, but can it be a 
mere coincidence that it has fallen to him, Mirko Tremaglia, the 
former sublieutenant under the Republic of Salo who now chairs 
the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, to 
break the news of al-Qadhdhafi's surrender over the Lockerbie 
affair? Yes, it is true, yesterday, the colonel of the 
Jamahiriyah, the supreme head of Islamic Libya, informed the 
veteran of the Empire -- via his ambassador in Rome -- that he 
will consent to the trial of the two men suspected of planting 
the bomb on the Pan Am jumbo. The trial will be held at the 
International Court of Justice in The Hague. 
  But, a native of Bergamo through and through, the 
indefatigable Tremaglia has also succeeded, in the very same 
hours, in hammering home to Russian Ambassador Valeriy Kenyaykin 
the need for Moscow to expedite the return of the remains of our 
war dead to Italy. In exchange, of course, for substantial aid, 
the Russian Government is also to withdraw its veto on the 
former communist countries joining NATO. 
  [Bianchessi] Full steam ahead, then, Mr. Chairman. What else 
do you have in mind to give Italy back its -- how did He 
[Mussolini] put it? -- place in the sun? 
  [Tremaglia] I am working on various matters. The unsettled 
legal dispute with Slovenia and Croatia takes first place. 
  [Bianchessi] Is that what it is, an unsettled legal dispute? 
  [Tremaglia] No doubt about it. The Osimo Treaty is a thing 
of the past. 
  [Bianchessi] What do you mean, a thing of the past? 
  [Tremaglia] It ceased to exist when the party that signed 
it, 
by which I mean Yugoslavia, became extinct. I have never called 
for territorial reviews. The legal dispute was opened by Italy 
in September 1992 with bilateral committees, whose findings were 
negative, however. We are pressing for two things: first, the 
right of the 350,000 exiles forcibly expelled in 1947 to go back 
to their homeland and have their property returned to them, 
though let us also remember the thousands massacred by Tito's 
forces in the canyons; second, safeguards for the Italian 
minority in Slovenia and Croatia, including the right to 
bilingualism. These are rights recognized by the Council of 
Europe and the Vienna Summit. The problems faced by the 
Italians have become much more serious since the territory was 
divided by the border between Slovenia and Croatia, which has 
done away with one of the basic principles, that of ethnic 
unity. We call on Slovenia and Croatia to treat the Italians as 
we treat the German-speaking population of the Alto Adige region. 
  [Bianchessi] Francesco Rocchetta, under secretary for 
foreign 
affairs, is about to set off for Sarajevo. What do we intend to 
do for Bosnia? 
  [Tremaglia] Rocchetta's trip will be a humanitarian mission, 
as in Rwanda. But it is not enough. All the political 
solutions have foundered by now. We must make our minds up to 
go in with air strikes to neutralize the shelling positions on 
the ground. This is the only way to enable the UN peacekeeping 
forces to help get the true political solution under way. 
  [Bianchessi] How about a quick look at Africa? 
  [Tremaglia] Yes, there are two things here that need rapid 
action. One concerns the northern African countries on the 
Mediterranean seaboard: a European investment program to 
provide work for 20 million North Africans in their own 
countries. This will curb the flood of immigration, not for 
racist motives, but for reasons of solidarity. We shall be 
talking about this in Cagliari in a month's time. Secondly, 
Somalia. It must absolutely not be allowed to end like this. 
Pulling out was a mistake. 
  [Bianchessi] Do you think that we will have to send our 
soldiers back there? 
  [Tremaglia] The peoples of the Horn of Africa are waiting 
for 
us. I have many contacts there who are telling me so all the 
time. I propose another initiative, even a solely Italian 
initiative, in Somalia, again under the aegis of the United 
Nations, and provided, of course, that the Somalis ask us to go. 
This time, it must really be a peace mission, bringing 
humanitarian aid, reconstruction, and reconciliation, and not a 
war operation. I believe that we can and must do it. We have a 
century of friendship with the peoples there that we must honor. 
  [Bianchessi] And your battle on behalf of expatriate 
Italians? 
  [Tremaglia] It continues. Indeed, I have called for the 
European election to be declared null and void because tens of 
thousands of our fellow countrymen have not received their 
voting papers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Maurizio Boccacci, leader of outlawed </F>
"Political Movement," by Carlo Chianura; place and date not 
given: "We Naziskins Will Construct a New Fascist Party" -- 
first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- The future? "A common way forward with a 
certain section of the Left." The enemy? "This government." 
[National Alliance leader] Fini? "A street-peddler of the new 
Right." Buontempo? "A new reference point, perhaps." What 
about immigrants? "They should be educated and sent back home." 
To this must be added the naziskins, the possible formation of 
a new fascist right-wing party, the articles appearing in 
FRIGIDAIRE, and the unbearable odor of anti-Semitism. This is 
Maurizio Boccacci, the 37-year-old leader of "Political 
Movement," which was outlawed through the law against fascism. 
When he is speaking away from the TV cameras he dispenses with 
his declamatory and militant demeanor, and adopts the more 
subdued tones of a self-made theoretician. Strikingly -- and 
disturbingly -- intelligent, he is riding the wave of nihilistic 
discontent currently sweeping through Rome's suburban slums. 
Solidarity with the five thugs who were arrested for beating up 
an immigrant and three Italians on the Ostia-Rome railway line 
has been the response of this "recooked capital," to use one of 
[film director] Pasolini's phrases. Boccacci is cashing in on a 
consensus which does not seem to be merely coincidental. 
  [Chianura] As on other occasions, you have expressed your 
solidarity with the aggressors, rather than with the victims. 
This is not surprising. Still, the question is: Why do people 
now show solidarity with those who are violent? 
  [Boccacci] You will never understand this until you know how 
young people live in a slum like this. 
  [Chianura] You tell us. 
  [Boccacci] A vacuum. Can you imagine absolute vacuum? The 
despair of living in slums with no future. The wish to emerge 
from this vacuum and this despair. 
  [Chianura] O.K., but it is not only young people who are 
attacking blacks. Their parents are involved too. Are they all 
sympathizers of yours? 
  [Boccacci] Whether our ideas are close, I cannot say. 
Certainly we share the same needs. This is why official 
politics has no say in these sections of town. 
  [Chianura] Whereas you in the "Political Movement" do have a 
say. However, your group has been outlawed. 
  [Boccacci] The movement has been disbanded, but not the 
area. 
  [Chianura] How do you strive to fulfill these "shared 
needs?" 
  [Boccacci] To begin with, our action against drugs is very 
strong. Apart from that, we have set up cultural and sports 
centers in the slums where nothing of the sort existed before. 
Furthermore, we aim to safeguard the rights of the people who 
live in those areas. 
  [Chianura] Safeguard in what sense? 
  [Boccacci] In the sense that first come Italians, and 
secondly immigrants, who will be tolerated if there are not too 
many of them. 
  [Chianura] How many is "too many?" 
  [Boccacci] When their numbers exceed the resources that 
local 
government can use for their integration. 
  [Chianura] After which, you will proceed to some 
"cleansing?" 
  [Boccacci] We do not do any cleansing. However, exasperation 
reaches unbearable levels. We want immigrants to become 
integrated. They must either become integrated -- among other 
things, through social welfare provision -- or go back home 
after studying here. In this way, they will be able to 
contribute to development in their own countries. 
  [Chianura] What happened after you were disbanded? 
  [Boccacci] I may seem presumptuous, but we grew. We are now 
500. 
  [Chianura] Where do you meet, given that your branch offices 
have been closed down. 
  [Boccacci] They thought that by pulling down a shutter they 
could shut us up too. But all we need is a square or a bar to 
meet. They made a crass mistake. They turned us into a myth. 
And now people like us even more. 
  [Chianura] Do you persist in your attacks on the Jewish 
world? 
  [Boccacci] I have the honor of having started the tendency 
to 
historical revisionism in Italy. We have shattered a taboo. 
But we are not anti-Jewish, we are anti-Zionist. Even the far 
Left, although they do not agree with us 100 percent, are 
beginning to say: They are not altogether wrong. 
  [Chianura] What sort of far Left are you speaking of? 
  [Boccacci] If you read the May issue of the monthly 
FRIGIDAIRE you will find an article, written by an independent 
commentator, dealing with economic globalism and racism, and in 
which self-determination is considered a fundamental issue. (In 
fact, the article in question is rather far removed from the 
Political Movement's positions -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) 
  [Chianura] Who is your worst enemy at the moment? 
  [Boccacci] Undoubtedly the present government. It is a 
liberal-capitalist government, which is exactly the opposite of 
fascism. It is easier to establish a rapport with 
serious-minded forces within the far Left than with such a 
system. 
  [Chianura] However, Gianfranco Fini is part of this 
government. 
  [Boccacci] Look here, we and him are on opposite sides. I 
have known him for some time and I can assure you that he has 
never been a fascist. He speaks of the good things that were 
done until 1938, but true fascists have fond memories of the 
march on Rome and the Social Republic [of Salo], more so than of 
the Twenty Years [of fascist rule] understood as the exercise of 
power. Fini is more a right-wing conservative leader, 
representing the bourgeoisie, the Christian Democrats. He has 
nothing to do with the revolutionary Right. 
  [Chianura] Fini will send you a telegram to thank you. 
However, now that National Alliance [AN] exists, what will you 
do? Will you try to take over the MSI [Italian Social Movement]? 
  [Boccacci] The MSI must remain faithful to its origins. 
  [Chianura] Otherwise? 
  [Boccacci] Otherwise we will build a movement capable of 
recovering this heritage. 
  [Chianura] Another party? Possibly with Buontempo in it? 
  [Boccacci] He may become a point of reference for this new 
formation.

Is it too early to give us a balance sheet? 
  [Speroni] No, I would like to say that at the next Council 
of 
Ministers I will present a bill aimed at revising the 
constitution and which would allow the regions to establish 
their own electoral laws. 
  [De Scalzi] What other powers have you promised to the local

  [Speroni] I have promised the regional authorities that 
there 
will be a revision of the Constitution in order to make it more 
federal. We are already in the process of setting up a 
committee to look at this. Afterwards, with the procedures laid 
out under Article 138 of the Constitution, we will go toward a 
revision which, on the basis of federalism, will hand more to 
the local authorities. 
  [De Scalzi] Are there any administrative measures in the 
bill?

of the Ministry for Institutional Reform but are the 
responsibility of the Civil Service Ministry

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Area' Born as Bridge Movement </F>
Between Center and Left"] 
  [Text] Rome -- A bridge between the two opposition forces, 
that of the Left and that of the center. This is the plan 
formulated by Ferdinando Adornato, former spokesman for the 
Democratic Alliance [AD], who yesterday left the mixed group in 
the Chamber of Deputies to become part of the progressive 
alignment. But Adornato will carve out his own independent niche 
within the left-wing front, an Area, as the group will be 
called, to "multiply the opportunities for dialogue and debate, 
with the aim of facilitating in as many instances as possible 
opportunities for mutual coordination in parliament." 
  The plan carries 12 signatures. Apart from Adornato, 
Deputies Serafino Pulcini and Enzo Torre also left the mixed 
group, while nine other Area deputies have come from the 
progressive group. There are former representatives of the 
Democratic Alliance such as Giovanna Melandrini, Miriam Mafai, 
Pasquale La Cerra, and Nicola Magrone, constituting part of the 
AD leadership which split when the time came to choose 
parliamentary groups. Willer Bordon, however, with the group of 
former Republicans elected on the AD lists, did not support the 
decision, and has stayed in the mixed group. Area has been 
joined, however, by a number of members elected on the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] lists, including Fabio 
Evangelisti, Ennio Grassi, Marco Pezzoni, and two independents, 
Ferdinando Schettino and Sergio De Julio. Thus, as the 
progressive forces' caucus leader, Luigi Berlinguer, noted with 
satisfaction, the diaspora of left-wing deputies that took 
different paths after the elections, is rallying together again: 
"With the three new members, we have reached 167 and are by far 
the largest group." 
  Adornato stressed that Area "will not be a political 
subject" 
but an instrument for "policy discussions" of 
"liberal-democratic, Christian, and environmentalist" leanings, 
open to contributions from "all interested parliamentarians." 
It will be active on two major fronts: rules and 
modernization. In order to "rejuvenate" the country it has a 
"program for life" comprising three main points: a form of 
capitalism featuring widely distributed ownership, educational 
reform, and the defense of human and social relations and of the 
vulnerable sectors of society -- "all issues rarely the subject 
of comprehensive dialogue." With regard to rules, the promotion 
of an institutional and socioeconomic federalism, the direct 
election of the prime minister (with a system of checks in order 
to ensure a balance of power) and antitrust legislation whereby 
no single television company has more than one channel. 
"Berlusconi," Adornato said, "cannot represent an impartial 
viewpoint with regard to the television system. His attack on 
the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] was the first time he 
showed himself reasoning as a politician and not as a 
businessman." Adornato suggests "making state contributions 
subject to open criteria of efficiency and productivity." He 
was scathing with regard to the opinion polls that the prime 
minister has produced on the subject of the RAI: "I too have 
conducted some opinion polls, and it emerges that what the 
voters are demanding from the RAI is not a policy program but 
efficiency; they want an end to the duopoly, and they consider 
Berlusconi too biased." His final proposal for a comprehensive 
reform of the television system was to entrust the plan to a 
committee of experts, "perhaps comprising [author] Umberto Eco, 
[LA VOCE editor] Indro Montanelli, former directors of 
television news programs, and former chairmen of the 
Constitutional Court."

  [Text] Once again Silvio Berlusconi spoke about the 
controversy concerning media and press freedom. Berlusconi paid 
a visit to the Saxa Rubra television studio today in order to 
take part in a European election debate. Giovanni Masotti 
reports: 
  [Masotti] There were smiles after the controversy: Silvio 
Berlusconi said that he felt at ease during his visit to the 
RAI. At Saxa Rubra he met Claudio Dematte and Gianni Locatelli, 
the chairman and managing director of the company, and 
immediately afterward was besieged by television cameras. 
Berlusconi was asked whether President Scalfaro's speech on 
freedom of information was a direct reference to his remarks: 
  [Berlusconi] "No, I do not think so because if there has 
been 
one thing that the newspapers have not done during these past 
few days, it is to take dictation [from the government]. If 
they were writing in this way there would certainly have not 
been the arguments following what I said, for example about the 
RAI." 
  [Masotti] The prime minister is not worried by the imminent 
lapsing of the RAI regulation on 28 June. He said the 
government had not yet dealt with the RAI issue. 
  [Berlusconi] "As of next week we will begin to talk about 
the 
RAI and we will be begin to discuss the RAI with an attitude 
that will be completely open and with the respect that is owed 
to a company that has many advantages." 
  [Masotti] The prime minister said that he had never 
envisaged 
exerting control over the RAI. 
  [Berlusconi] "This idea has never even entered my mind. I 
have never thought that the government could want to have a RAI 
that was pro-government. This would be squalid if it were to 
happen." 
  [Masotti] Berlusconi, who does not rule out the possibility 
of selling off parts of Fininvest, defended Giuseppe 
Santaniello, the media ombudsman. 
  [Berlusconi] "The ombudsman has always fulfilled his mandate 
with a great independence and with, I must say, a lot of 
balance." 
  [Masotti] The prime minister was friendly and open. In 
contrast, the atmosphere at the assembly of RAI employees that 
was taking place nearby, was less so. There was concern and 
great alarm. The editorial committees of the three channels 
stressed that public service broadcasting had to represent the 
whole country and all sections of society. They said that the 
right of citizens to the media was at stake.

<F P=106> ["Synthesis" of interview with Senate speaker Carlo </F>
Scognamiglio by RAI Uno's Demetrio Volcic in Rome on 8 June, 
reported by "ri.lu.": "Scognamiglio: `Senior Management Must 
Be Appointed by the Government'" -- first paragraph is LA 
REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- If it had been up to Carlo Scognamiglio, his 
"colleague" Claudio Dematte [RAI chairman] and the other RAI 
[Italian Broadcasting Corporation] wise men would not have been 
pilloried. However, once the problem had hit the fan -- "due to 
a number of newscasts which were too partisan" -- the Senate 
speaker joined issue and, in an interview with TG1 [RAI 
newscast] director Demetrio Volcic, which was broadcast 
yesterday during the "23.00 Hours" program, he agreed with 
[Prime Minister] Berlusconi on the fact that the public 
broadcaster ought not be antigovernment, and he added that, in 
the future, the company's top management ought to be appointed 
by the government. Here is the gist of what he said. 
  [Volcic] Is it good or bad that the issue of the broadcast 
media has been posed now, and in such terms? 
  [Scognamiglio] The problem must now be tackled, but it would 
have been better if it had never been posed and if things could 
have continued the normal way. However, I do not think that 
this was a piece of naivety, but rather a reaction against an 
attitude that called for such a reaction. What attitude? The 
broadcast media in general, not only the RAI, were showing a 
marked hostility toward the government. However, when a 
political force becomes the "state," the tone used must be 
adapted accordingly. 
  [Volcic] Do you think the RAI is too critical of Berlusconi? 
  [Scognamiglio] I think so. I do not watch TV very often, but 
two days ago I watched the TG3 newscast, which was an example of 
factiousness against the government. 
  [Volcic] Must the company's senior management go? 
  [Scognamiglio] The board of directors will stay legitimately 
in office until the end of its term. Afterwards, in the 
unfortunate event that once again the parliamentary speakers 
are called upon to appoint the top management, I can anticipate 
that another power-sharing agreement will not take place. 
  [Volcic] Who should appoint the RAI's board of directors? 
  [Scognamiglio] Just as in the United States the "agencies'" 
top management is appointed by the government under the control 
of a parliamentary commission, I believe that also in the RAI's 
case the government should be entrusted with the task of 
appointing the management, and the opposition forces should be 
entrusted with the task of critically vetting the appointments 
made. 
  [Volcic] Does this not involve the risk that the winning 
tribe will eat up the losing tribe? 
  [Scognamiglio] In a democracy, every rule can be used 
against 
the majority eventually when citizens, through their vote, 
decide to send the majority into opposition. 
  [Volcic] Would you place public broadcasting in the 
government's hands? 
  [Scognamiglio] Information should remain neutral, but 
someone 
must be responsible for appointing the top management. Whoever 
has been chosen by the citizens to govern the country must 
assume responsibility for the appointments. The citizens will 
judge. 
  [Volcic] Is this not an unrealistic position? 
  [Scognamiglio] In the United States, the vetting process 
undergone by the government's appointees is such as to make it 
very difficult for a professionally and morally unqualified 
person to be vetted.

  [Text] "The matter is closed", said Claudio Dematte, the

  The prime minister "told me that his plan is very clear: The

who along with RAI Managing Director Gianni Locatelli, met 
Berlusconi at the Saxa Rubra television center. "We agreed to

<F P=106> [Commentary by Indro Montanelli: "Europe, A Case of Public </F>
Forgery"] 
  [Text] Next Sunday [12 June] the European Community as a 
whole will vote in the European elections. It is easy to 
predict that, in terms of the turnout, Italy will be the most 
diligent. We will be much praised for this prelacy, which has 
been ours for some considerable time, and which will be 
interpreted as evidence of strong European commitment on our 
part. But, among ourselves, this is not really the issue at 
stake. 
  Only a very small proportion of Italians who will vote will 
do so thinking of Europe or in the hope of contributing to its 
unification. Out of the 80 European deputies who will be 
elected only a fraction will make their way to the parliament in 
Strasbourg with the aim of attempting to achieve something 
there. As for the vast majority of both candidates and voters, 
Sunday's elections are only a testing ground for national 
politics, one which will reveal the actual balance of forces, 
not so much between the majority and the opposition as between 
the parties within the majority. 
  In other words -- and so much for Europe -- the real issue 
will be to decide who among [National Alliance leader] Fini, 
[League Secretary] Bossi, and [Prime Minister] Berlusconi is the 
strongest. In the continuing and, indeed, increasingly marked 
absence of effective opposition forces (namely, the center and 
the Left), accounts are essentially to be settled among the 
ruling Right's three bosses. Of course, we resort to such 
labels -- center, Right, and Left --only for the sake of 
expediency and simplicity. In fact, these terms belong to the 
language of archaeology. So much so that, in order to give some 
sort of contents to their arguments, what do they focus on? On 
the merits and shortcomings of statesman Mussolini, or on the 
"values of the Resistance." No less than 50 years later. 
  We are not saying all this in order to discourage voters 
from 
going to the polls, but rather to prevent any misunderstandings 
about the significance of the elections. Nobody, or hardly 
anybody, will cast their vote with the Maastricht Treaty in mind 
(in fact, nobody or hardly anybody knows anything at all about 
Maastricht). Everybody, or almost everybody, will vote thinking 
of Bossi, Fini, or Berlusconi, as apparent from the fact that 
all three are heading their respective lists, even thought 
everybody knows that Berlusconi will never be able to go to 
Strasbourg since this is incompatible with his post as prime 
minister; that Bossi will never want to go there because the 
Lombard dialect is not yet one of the official languages in 
Strasbourg; and that, as far as Fini is concerned, it would be 
best if he does not go to Strasbourg because too many rumors (of 
an ideological kind, of course) are circulating about him in 
Europe. 
  All three, should they be chosen by voters, will delegate 
their duties to their henchmen. However, they will not be the 
sole absentees in a European Parliament in which Italian 
representatives have always held -- with a few rare exceptions 
-- three not very honorable records, namely those of 
absenteeism, salaries (the highest in Europe), and incompetence 
on almost every issue tabled. Indeed, it is equally notorious 
that, despite the financial rewards and the numerous related 
benefits, Italian politicians (once again, I repeat, with a few 
commendable exceptions) consider a seat in Strasbourg as a 
"consolation prize" which the bosses reserve for their most 
zealous, albeit dumb, minor vassals. 
  All this turns Sunday's European elections into a sort of 
public forgery, without however any penal consequences. Yet, 
there is no choice but to vote. Not for Europe's sake, since 
nobody is interested in Europe, anyway. Rather, in order to see 
how much Berlusconi will manage to bleed Bossi, and therefore to 
what extent he will have to reach an understanding with him or, 
alternatively, get rid of him. This is not an irrelevant issue. 
Many things, both good and bad, may result from it. For us, 
though -- not for Europe.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Gianni Baget Bozzo: "Europe and the </F>
Countries of the East"] 
  [Text] The issue of the Italian ministers belonging to the 
National Alliance has created a controversy with regard to the 
elections to the European Parliament. Having raised some 
problems in the field of public ethics, Italy now poses a 
growing issue with regard to Europe's identity as a community 
based on certain values. But it is not Italy alone that makes 
the 1994 elections different from all its predecessors. 
  Now Europe extends no longer from the Atlantic to the Elbe, 
but from the Atlantic to Vladivostok, the city where 
Solzhenitsyn is deliberately beginning his voyage of rediscovery 
through Russia. Basically, this strengthens the cohesion and 
force of attraction of the Twelve. As long as the communist 
empire existed, the Russian system had a rigid and limited 
scope. Now between the borders of Russia and those of the 
European Union [EU] there extends a no man's land that is bound 
neither to the West nor to the East and that is seeking links 
with the West because it fears another Russian era in the 
European East. 
  It is as a consequence of this innovation in the East that 
the innovation in the north has occurred: The Nordic countries 
and Austria are becoming part of the Community, while other 
countries of the East have applied. The EU may become a focal 
point on the continent in the face of possible developments in 
Russia. 
  What is certain is that Russia will try to regain influence 
over the lands of the former USSR, offering as an alternative to 
the West a guarantee of balance in the East. But this is no 
easy objective, because Ukraine is a difficult problem to 
resolve. Be that as it may, the East, starting with Russia, is 
in a state of flux, and this is causing a real change in the 
Europe of the Twelve. 
  Postcommunist parties are in power in all the countries of 
the East that aspire to join the Union, apart from the Czech 
Republic. 
  This does not mean that the membership of the countries of 
the East is imminent, because it is impossible for them to 
implement EU policies, starting with agriculture. But it does 
mean that Europe will be governed by different systems of 
association with the Community, which already exist within the 
EU as a result of the exemptions granted to the British and 
especially the Danish in order to secure their adherence to the 
Maastricht Treaty. 
  National differences are therefore destined to prevail. For 
that matter, the principle of subsidiarity established in 
Maastricht is basically the reverse of the principle of 
federalism. Under European federalism it is a virtue to 
transfer responsibilities from the nations to the European 
authorities: Under the principle of subsidiarity, the opposite 
is true. In any case, in Italy's domestic debate federalism 
correctly means increasing local powers to the detriment of the 
central authorities. In some European countries, the principle 
of subsidiarity established in Maastricht is cited as an 
addition to the responsibilities of local authorities. The era 
of European federalism seems to have come to an end, and what is 
starting now is basically similar to an ancient institution, 
that of the "European concert of nations," in other words, the 
accord among the major European states to establish the common 
interests of the whole. 
  The protagonists of this European concert of nations can 
already be seen: They are Germany and France. The old 
Carolingian Europe is at the center of the new European system, 
particularly because it has determined its course. And it is 
certainly Germany that is steering events: If Chancellor Kohl 
wins the elections, it will be not because he is Adenauer's 
successor, but because he has radically updated policy, pushing 
Germany eastward in accordance with an ancient tendency -- 
Germany as organizer of the Slavic world. 
  From the viewpoint of the Community institutions, this means 
an increase in intergovernmental activity, that is, in the role 
of the Council of Ministers and of the permanent 
representatives. For that matter, in the years before 
Maastricht the most important event, established in the Single 
Act of 1985, was political cooperation, that is, a body not 
envisaged by the treaties, which established permanent meetings 
on all matters of common interest on the part of the foreign 
ministers of the Twelve. Maastricht incorporated this 
institution into the Treaty of Rome, and perhaps this is one of 
the most significant modifications. 
  Overall European cooperation, at the military level too, 
will 
become all the more demanding as America's foreign policy 
becomes vaguer with the accession to power of the Vietnam 
generation: The "new order" and the "unipolar world" envisaged 
by Bush's strategists lasted less than a year. Now Europe must 
provide with its own forces. The terrible tragedy in Bosnia, 
far from being over, will cause us further difficult times, when 
we can even foresee a European disengagement, open warfare 
between the sides involved, and an end to the arms embargo. It 
is a very different Europe from that of 1989 that is about to 
elect its fourth Parliament.

<F P=106> [Article by Pekka Vaisanen: "Opposition to EU Has Lessened </F>
Now That Results of Negotiations Are Clear -- Support Nearly 
Unchanged, More People Uncertain Than Before"] 
  [Text] According to a recent Trade and Industry Commission 
(EVA) poll, about 40 percent of all Finns now support membership 
in the European Union [EU]. About 37 percent of them oppose 
membership. More than a fifth of all citizens cannot yet say 
where they stand on the issue. 
  In comparison with the last EVA poll conducted last fall, 
support for membership has increased by about a percentage 
point. Opposition to it has decreased by about 4 percentage 
points. Now that the results of the membership negotiations are 
clear, it is surprising that the percentage of people who are 
uncertain of where they stand on membership has increased by 3 
percentage points since last fall. 
  Men are still clearly more enthusiastic supporters of 
membership than women. Nearly a third of the women are uncertain 
about it. 
  The biggest change since last fall is in how young people 
view it. Support for membership among those from 18 to 25 years 
of age has considerably dropped. On the other hand, support for 
membership has increased in the oldest age group. 
<H5>  Center Party Still Opposes It </H5>
  EVA has been reporting on how Finns view EU membership a 
couple of times a year since the beginning of the decade. This 
time 1,900 replies to an interview conducted by mail were 
received between 30 March and 6 May. 
  SAK [Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions] members' 
position on EU membership has become more positive than before. 
Nevertheless, there are still more opponents of membership in 
SAK than supporters. On the other hand, opposition to membership 
has increased in the STTK [Finnish Central Federation of 
Technical Functionaries]. AKAVA [Academic Professional 
Commission] members are still the most enthusiastic supporters 
of membership among wage earners. 
  Three-fourths of the farmers and MTK [Agricultural Producers 
Association] members still oppose membership. The interviews for 
the EVA poll were conducted mainly in April when national 
measures in support of agriculture had largely not yet taken 
shape. 
  Center Party supporters now take a slightly more positive 
view of membership than before, but there are clearly still more 
opponents of it in the party than supporters. The party 
leadership's vigorous policy of promoting EU membership is 
beginning to take effect among SDP [Social Democratic Party] 
supporters. There are already twice as many supporters of 
membership as opponents of it. 
  On the other hand, enthusiasm for the EU is fading among 
supporters of the Greens and the Left League. Opposition to it 
has grown in both parties since the fall. 
  Sixty-eight percent of all citizens feel certain that they 
will vote in the consultative referendum next fall. 
<H5>  Media Will Determine Result </H5>
  The results of the negotiations achieved by Finland in early 
March are, in Finns' opinion, mainly satisfactory. Only a small 
number of supporters felt that they were very good. Most of the 
supporters described the results as satisfactory. Most of the 
opponents felt that the results were poor or very poor. 
  In the opinion of many of the respondents, there was too 
much 
emphasis on agriculture during the membership negotiations. In 
the opinion of the majority of the respondents, we should not 
have agreed to removing restrictions on foreign ownership of 
summer cottages in the negotiations. 
  Over half of the citizens feel that they are not very well 
informed on the results of the negotiations. Young people, 
students, and women are most uninformed on them. 
  Fully 81 percent of the respondents feel that the media will 
have a decisive effect on the outcome of the referendum. 
  Many of them mentioned the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation 
television news and the local newspaper as being their most 
important sources of information. In Uusimaa they felt that 
HELSINGIN SANOMAT was almost as important a source as the 
television news. 
<H5>  Finland Will Probably Be a Member Within Next Few Years </H5>
  Finns feel it likely that Finland will be a member of the EU 
within the next few years. Fully 81 percent of the interviewees, 
that is, at least one out of every two opponents of membership, 
are of the same opinion. 
  How Finns view the most important goals of the Maastricht 
Treaty was also followed for a couple of years in the course of 
the poll. Forty-three percent of them now support a common 
foreign policy, but 46 percent still oppose it. 
<H5>  Over Half Opposed ECU </H5>
  Fifty-one percent of all Finns supported Finland's 
committing 
itself to common EU security and foreign policies and 51 percent 
to a common economic policy as well. 
  However, only 37 percent of all Finns wanted a common 
currency, the ECU, while 52 percent opposed the idea. 
<H5>  Citizens Hope Finland Will Avert Disadvantages of EU </H5>
Membership 
  "In the final analysis, whether EU membership is good or bad 
for our country is a matter of faith, regarding which no one has 
certain knowledge." This, according to the EVA poll, is what one 
out of every two Finns thinks. 
  This time the Trade and Industry Commission also explored 
citizens' fears and hopes with regard to EU membership during 
its EU opinion poll. 
  Most of the respondents felt that Finland would be labeled a 
fringe area, isolated from West Europe if membership in the EU 
is not realized. Most of them also felt that, as a member of the 
EU, Finland would before long become a member of a military 
alliance, either NATO or the WEU. 
  Frightened by the unrest in Russia, Finns feel that, "with 
an 
unstable Russia as its neighbor, it would be safer for Finland 
to be a member of the EU than to stay out of it." Fifty-four 
percent of the respondents were of this opinion, while 22 
percent differed on this. 
  Half of all Finns think that Finland does not have a chance 
of influencing EU decisions but, on the other hand, just as many 
also feel that Finns would not even notice membership in their 
daily lives. 
  If the decisionmakers were to respect citizens' opinions, 
they would organize the referendum on the EU to be held 
simultaneously with those to be held in Sweden and Norway. 
Forty-nine percent of all citizens want a simultaneous 
referendum, while 24 percent do not feel that that is necessary. 
  Many Finns do not regard the EU "as a paradise." We may 
infer 
from this that citizens hope that Finland will, as a member of 
the EU, first and foremost avert the disadvantages they fear 
will result from membership. 
  Finns do not think that EU membership would help Finland 
maintain control over international crime. Seventy-seven percent 
of the respondents feel that Finland should further the 
combating of international crime in particular in the EU. 
<H5>  Women Worried About Social Security </H5>
  In citizens' opinion, the third most important concern to be 
promoted in the EU would be the protection of [members'] right 
to self-determination. Citizens also hope that Finland will try 
to reduce the EU bureaucracy, promote environmental standards, 
and defend the Nordic social security model. Forty-four percent 
of the respondents fear that Finland would not be allowed to 
determine its own level of social security as a member of the EU. 
  Both supporters and opponents of membership have the same 
sort of list of objectives. Women are more worried than men 
about women's status and Nordic social security. 
  Finns take a more pessimistic view of the future of the 
labor 
union movement in the EU than do labor leaders. Forty-five 
percent think that the status of the labor union movement and 
its opportunities to influence decisions will be reduced with 
membership, and they cannot muster any faith in the labor union 
movement's chances of influencing international decisions either.

<F P=106> [Article by Unto Hamalainen: "SDP Backs Finland's Membership </F>
in EU"] 
  [Text] The SDP (Social Democratic Party) unreservedly backs 
Finland's membership in the European Union [EU]. 
  A decision will be made at a meeting of the party executive 
committee to be held at Finlandia House next Wednesday [18 May]. 
<H5>  Challenge To Be Seized </H5>
  "The SDP's position is clear: Membership in the European 
Union is a big challenge for Finland, an opportunity that must 
be seized now," the executive committee says in a draft of its 
position paper that was discussed at the SDP executive committee 
meeting on Wednesday. 
  The position paper was drafted by the integration committee, 
headed by MP Erkki Tuomioja. 
  According to the committee's draft, the SDP will also 
support 
expansion of the EU in the future. The SDP supports "an open 
union of European countries that meet the prerequisites for 
membership and are committed to democracy." 
  According to the draft, EU membership must not be allowed to 
become an issue that divides the nation. The Union must be 
developed in an open and democratic direction. 
<H5>  Parliamentarianism Must Be Strengthened </H5>
  "For the same purpose too, we must continue to pursue 
constitutional reform that strengthens parliamentarianism in 
Finland before membership is implemented," the SDP thinks. If 
the party executive committee approves the proposal, it would 
mean altering the Constitution so that the power to determine 
foreign policy would be transferred from the president to the 
government and parliament even before the start of next year. 
  The SDP has announced that its goal is a Europe modeled 
after 
the Nordic welfare state. The SDP wants to restore the exercise 
of power, which internationalization has taken away from 
national decisionmaking, to "democratic decisionmaking" in the 
Union. 
<H5>  Monetary Union Is a Proper Goal </H5>
  The SDP wants to develop common Union foreign and security 
policies based on "sovereign states." Finland must be willing to 
participate in joint peacekeeping missions whenever they do not 
jeopardize its vital interests. 
  It views a common monetary union as a proper goal. Before we 
can proceed to that, however, we must agree on special measures 
required to reduce unemployment.

<F P=106> [Article by Renny Jokelin: "Germany Expects Finland To Be an </F>
Ally in Union; German Ambassador Would Reduce Number of 
Commissioners"] 
  [Text] Germany regards Finland, the other Nordic countries, 
and Austria as natural allies in developing the European Union 
[EU] once these countries have become members of the EU. 
Germany's ambassador to the EU serving in Brussels, Dietrich von 
Kyaw, believes that Finland and Germany will find that they have 
common interests particularly as the EU develops its relations 
with East Europe, the Baltic countries, and Russia. 
  Speaking at a German-Finnish Chamber of Commerce gathering, 
von Kyaw outlined, among other things, the goal of turning the 
Baltic into a real Union inland waterway surrounded by EU 
members in the Baltic countries, Poland, and Germany. Russia 
would not be a member, but it would be bound to the Union by 
many political and economic ties. 
  Von Kyaw reminded his listeners that Germany had recently 
helped Finland to get into the Union. The Finns had declared in 
Brussels that they would walk out of the membership negotiations 
unless the Nordic agricultural model was accepted as part of the 
membership agreement. The Germans intervened at the time and 
talked the EU into approving the agreement. 
  Von Kyaw said that he views EU membership as being of both 
economic and political benefit to Finns. According to him, it is 
very hard in present-day Europe to solve problems any more at 
the national level. 
  "If anyone thinks that Finland's membership in the EU will 
resolve all of Finland's problems quickly, he is mistaken," von 
Kyaw, however, noted. 
  Von Kyaw said that he believes the EU is progressing toward 
a 
monetary union, a common currency, and a central bank, among 
other things, in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty, his own 
countrymen's doubts notwithstanding. 
  According to the German ambassador, "in the long run," the 
Union may also move toward a common defense policy. Finland can 
stick to its own security policy line "under the present 
circumstances." 
  The EU will decide on its new defense policy approaches in 
1996 and Finland, in von Kyaw's opinion, can at that time 
"present its own view of defense and get the Union to move in a 
favorable direction." 
<H5>  Finland May Lose Commissioner's Seat </H5>
  Germany wants to intensively tighten up the Union. Von Kyaw 
said that the administrative organs in Brussels must be made 
more effective at that time. This, among other things, means 
that the present number of EU Commission members will be 
reduced. The ambassador to the EU did not specify the number of 
commissioners Germany is aiming for. 
  The chief German Government parties have earlier talked of 
10 
commissioners, in which event Finland, among others, would lose 
its commissioner. 
  Germany would also like to endow majority decisions at 
ministerial meetings with more authority and increase the EU 
Parliament's legislative powers.

<F P=106> [Guest commentary by Pekka Tiainen, special investigator in </F>
Labor Ministry statistics unit: "Our Debt Burden Will Grow in 
EU"] 
  [Text] Pekka Tiainen estimates that Finland will be paying 
the European Union [EU] over 3 billion markkas more than it 
receives from it but, as a result of membership in the EU, there 
will be a total deficit of 55 billion markkas for the public 
sector to cover between 1995 and 2000. 
  Membership in the European Union will be considerably more 
costly for Finland than those responsible for the negotiations 
have so far publicly stated it will be. An error produced by 
counting subsidies for disadvantaged areas twice was discovered 
later. Therefore, Finland will be making net payments to the EU 
right from the start. However, the net cost to Finland is also 
estimated at too low a figure in a report, "The Impact of the 
EU, a Summary," published on 29 March 1994. Neither the funds to 
be paid to the EU Development and Cohesion Fund nor the 6.1 
billion markkas for funding to be granted to the European 
Investment Bank (EIB) and loan commitments are included in the 
summary figures. They too must be counted as expenses since none 
of the funding representing solutions to problems is for 
Finland; quite the contrary, the EU will try to use these funds 
to finance its East European ventures. The permanent EU farm 
subsidies (CAP [Common Agricultural Policy] subsidies) will 
presumably still remain the same, even though they are tied to 
production, which is decreasing. 
  When we make these adjustments and use estimates of economic 
growth and inflation rates that correspond to the basic tenor of 
the Finance Ministry's latest "Economic Policy Line" report, we 
get a Finnish payment to the EU for the years 1995-2000 
averaging 9.5 billion markkas a year and funding for Finland 
from the EU amounting to about 6 billion markkas a year. Over 
these years Finland will pay the EU a total of 57 billion 
markkas and receive 36 billion markkas from it; that is, it will 
be paying it over 20 billion markkas more than it receives from 
it. 
  Conservatively estimated, a fifth of our domestic demand for 
food products will be covered by additional imports worth about 
20 billion markkas between 1995 and 2000. Our net payments to 
the EU and the additional imports will burden our trade balance 
with a total of 40 billion markkas. If EU participation in the 
marketing of Finland's agricultural surplus at first compensates 
for this to the tune of a billion a year and EEA [European 
Economic Area] expenditures are reduced, we will still be in the 
hole to the extent of over 30 billion markkas. In addition to 
that there will be the expenditures for interest. 
  From the standpoint of the Finnish public sector deficit, 
the 
situation looks even much worse. We will be contributing 9.5 
billion markkas a year to the EU budget, 300 million markkas of 
which we will be spared because of the elimination of EEA 
expenses. In addition to this, 6.3 billion markkas a year will 
be expended for national limiting conditions stemming directly 
from the EU agreement and for northern subsidies. 
  We will lose nearly 13 billion markkas a year in excise 
taxes 
and taxes and duties on farm products. During the first year we 
will also suffer 2.5 billion markkas in grain storage losses. If 
the domestic demand for farm products declines by a fifth and 
structural changes result in about 1 percentage point more 
unemployment elsewhere, that will cost us 4 billion markkas a 
year in expenditures for unemployment and in loss of tax 
revenue. This will result in a gross sum of 32 billion markkas 
to be covered. 
  Current farm subsidies will be reduced by the gross sum of 7 
billion markkas a year. After deducting this, there will still 
be 25 billion markkas a year to be covered. If reductions in 
excise taxes are covered with new taxes, we will be able to save 
an average 11 billion markkas a year. By cutting current funds 
for employment as well as regional and construction subsidies by 
an amount equivalent to what comes in from EU funding or 
national subsidies stemming directly from the EU agreement, we 
will be able to save 4 billion markkas. Funds from these sources 
amount to 23 billion markkas a year. 
  But over 10 billion markkas a year on average will still not 
be compensated for. The public sector will be left with a total 
deficit of 55 billion markkas to cover between 1995 and 2000 as 
a result of EU membership.

<F P=106> [Article by Charles Clover: "Fury Over Norway's Whaling </F>
Defiance"] 
  [Text] Britain yesterday condemned Norway's decision to 
kill 301 minke whales this year in defiance of a worldwide 
whaling moratorium. 
  Norway has given its whalers a quota of 29 more whales than 
last year despite International Whaling Commission [IWC] advice 
that stocks could tolerate a quota of only one whale, even if 
the moratorium was overturned. 
  The decision, 10 days after the International Whaling 
Commission meeting in Mexico, is likely to bring international 
condemnation and may bring sanctions from the United States. 
  Under the quota set by Norway's Labour government, 189 
whales 
will be killed by the commercial fleet and 112 for research. 
  Last year Norway declared its first commercial whaling quota 
for six years in defiance of the 1986 moratorium and had hoped 
to get the moratorium overturned. 
  A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture said last night 
"The government deplores Norway's decision to whale for a 
further year particularly in view of the uncertainty there 
currently is about the number of minke whales in the North 
Atlantic." 
  At the Mexico meeting the scientific committee of the IWC 
took issue with Norway's assertion that there were 86,000 minke 
whales in the North East Atlantic The scientific committee said 
there were only 50,000. 
  Greenpeace said that it was appealing to companies to step 
up 
boycotts of Norwegian fish. 
  Last year Safeway and Iceland stores imposed boycotts of 
Norwegian products.

<F P=106> [Johan Schuck report: "Support for Our Policy"] </F>
  [Text] Paris -- Finance Minister Anne Wibble is satisfied 
with the conclusions reached by the OECD in its study of work 
and employment. They lend support to what the government wants 
to do with the Swedish economy, she claimed. 
  Wibble was referring among other things to a reduction in 
the 
level of unemployment benefits, changes to labor law, and her 
past statements about the need for lower wages for young people. 
She was also thinking about the proposal that is on the 
government's desk awaiting discussion on Thursday [9 June] whose 
thrust is to prevent the unemployed from moving backward and 
forward between unemployment benefit and labor market stimulus 
measures for an unlimited period. 
  According to Wibble, the level of unemployment benefit in 
Sweden is higher than in any other industrialized country, if 
all measures designed to help the unemployed are brought into 
the equation. She takes the view that this is something that 
the OECD has missed in its study and this means that Sweden on 
the contrary ends up around the average in this respect. 
  Strengthened by the support from the OECD report Wibble 
wants 
to go further -- for example, by tightening up the requirements 
at employment centers relating to what are to be considered 
suitable jobs for those seeking work. For example, distances of 
several dozen kilometers should not necessarily be seen as an 
obstacle to accepting a job, she said. 
  The finance minister also noted that the Social Democratic 
proposal for a coordinated financial stimulus from the countries 
of Europe does not have the support of the OECD. 
  Nevertheless she is optimistic about Sweden's chances of 
escaping much of the structural unemployment that has hit the 
majority of countries in Europe: 
  "Long-term unemployment is still relatively low in Sweden. 
We are lagging behind the others and can learn from their 
mistakes. The measures the government is taking are aimed 
precisely at increasing flexibility, so that more people can 
find jobs," Wibble said. 
  However, Wibble is not entirely uncritical of the OECD 
report. It ought to have been clearer on the subject of the 
priorities given to various measures and stated more clearly 
which countries they were intended for, she said. The finance 
minister does not think that the proposed tax cuts contained in 
the report are suitable for Sweden. In Sweden budget 
consolidation goes before everything else.

<F P=106> [Interview with Owe Wiktorin, Armed Forces Supreme Commander </F>
designate, by Sune Olofson; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Olofson] You will be a supreme commander who will 
probably have to pilot the defense forces into yet another 
period of cuts. Money is tight and the JAS [multirole combat 
aircraft] project, with the high rate of exchange of the dollar 
and the low rate of exchange for the krona, threatens to explode 
the defense forces' overall budget. How will you sort all this 
out? 
  [Wiktorin] After the 1992 Defense Bill came the crisis 
package, which reduced our scope for action. Then there was the 
Navy's strained budget and the uncertainties of the price 
compensation system that could possibly affect the Jas project. 
These are uncertainty factors affecting how we are to deal with 
things. 
  We should not be raising problems at the present time, for 
when I look around in the defense forces I see optimism for the 
future, drive, professional colleagues, and a strong sense of 
loyalty. I think that we will be able to comply with the 
Defense Bill if we are not hit by further cuts. Within the 
framework of an almost unchanged budget, we have cut the 
organization by almost one-third, with the concomitant stresses 
for personnel. Now we need peace and quiet in which to work, 
order and stability to put into practice the decisions already 
made. 
  [Olofson] Do you really believe that the defense forces will 
be able to afford to modernize 16 Army brigades? 
  [Wiktorin] The Defense Bill says that 16 brigades are to be 
modernized up to the end of the century. I am assuming that the 
decision reached by the Riksdag remains in force. There is no 
other thrust I know of. 
  [Olofson] Since 1987 the number of Army brigades has fallen 
from 29 to 16. The Social Democrats, with a majority of voters 
behind them, are proposing 8 to 10 brigades. Sweden's land area 
is large, its coast long. Are you prepared to administer just 
any old watered-down military organization? 
  [Wiktorin] Regardless of the color of the government it has 
the responsibility for the security of the country. It is 
impossible to water down the Army's wartime organization just 
any way. If the amount of money is cut considerably we will not 
be able to modernize and sharpen the defense forces that remain. 
We would then be in a very bad position. It is my view that we 
are very close to the point of no return. 
  [Olofson] But is it not the case, Owe Wiktorin, that if the 
modernization of the Armed Forces is to continue their concrete 
organization must become even smaller? 
  [Wiktorin] I do not rule out the possibility that more such 
steps could come; this depends to some extent on technical 
developments and on what solutions we can find together. 
Sixteen brigades, 16 Air Force divisions are not fixed figures 
for me. 
  Regardless of whether we have an increased, unchanged, or 
reduced budget it is possible that we might want to reduce the 
number of units so that they are sufficiently sharp. It is the 
overall defense strength and potential in a new security 
situation that is decisive. Increases in quality must continue. 
  [Olofson] You have proposed a new sort of doctrine, the 
three-dimensional war, which requires quicker and more mobile 
units with different sorts of defense missions. Does this mean 
that you advocate attack helicopters? 
  [Wiktorin] If we have fewer units we will have to 
compensate for that weakness with increased mobility. Otherwise 
things do not fit together. We would not be able to defend the 
whole country. An orientation involving increased mobility was 
laid down in part in the 1992 Defense Bill. That was when the 
decision for 120 mobile tanks was taken and we hope to receive 
an additional 80 in a later option. 
  Attack helicopters are a very desirable complement, but 
given 
the budget we have today reflection is needed. It is doubtful 
whether we can afford these expensive systems at the present 
time, but studies are being carried out. 
  For the time being at least we can make do with more 
powerful 
engines in the lightweight SK-60 attack aircraft. It is true 
that they cannot do everything that helicopters can, but they 
can do quite a lot. 
  [Olofson] We taxpayers pay out 40 billion a year to the 
defense forces. But what do we actually get to know about the 
defense forces' capacity and what we in the end get for our 
money? 
  [Wiktorin] After the far-reaching changes in Central Europe 
and Russia we can probably sleep pretty soundly at night. The 
problem is that the situation could change rapidly, and as the 
next supreme commander I would like us to be in an even better 
position. But we are strong in several areas. 
  There is much of which we can be proud in the defense 
forces, 
but it is so un-Swedish to give oneself a pat on the back. 
International experts shower words of praise on Swedish UN 
soldiers. Our defense industry has never been at such a high 
technical level as it is now. We must defend it. 
  [Olofson] In your years as chief of the defense staff in 
Stockholm and military commander in southern Sweden did you know 
about the defense forces' secret cooperation with NATO countries? 
  [Wiktorin] During my career as an officer I have never had 
any impression or indication that we officers had overstepped 
the limits of the security policy decided on by the government 
and Riksdag. 
  [Olofson] The whole of the Swedish people has been thought 
to have been duped; there has never been any real neutrality to 
speak of, has there? 
  [Wiktorin] I have read the report of the commission on 
neutrality policy with great interest and note that an 
overwhelming amount of information exists at the political 
level, in defense committees and elsewhere, but no one debated 
the matter. On a broad front there was a "lid-on" approach that 
we can be surprised by and criticize. After all we do want an 
open society. 
  [Olofson] Will you, like your predecessor, Bengt Gustafsson, 
be taking the step in the direction of a Nordic defense alliance? 
  [Wiktorin] In the current situation I see no base for such 
an alliance; if such an alliance does come about, it is a 
process that will have to be thrashed out in a political debate. 
On the other hand I want a continuation and deepening of the 
positive defense cooperation we already have in the Nordic area, 
in the materiel field, for example. 
  [Olofson] Have you ever had any doubts about the submarine 
violations? 
  [Wiktorin] Yes, about one or two individual events, but not 
the overall picture. I have consciously adopted a doubting and 
critical approach in order to be as unbiased as possible when 
looking at analyses and reports. 
  [Olofson] What orientation does the Swedish military 
intelligence service have after the fall of the Warsaw Pact? 
  [Wiktorin] In the past few years it has to a large extent 
followed the withdrawal of troops from the Baltic region. The 
new world that is now emerging has unfortunately led to a number 
of new sources of conflict that we should also study. 
  [Olofson] MUST [Military Intelligence and Security Service], 
the military intelligence service, claims that it will take 
Russia at least 10 years to build up a new military force with 
invasion capability. Is this not to underestimate the Russians' 
potential? 
  [Wiktorin] It will probably take 10 years to build up the 
military capacity that the former Soviet Union had. But the 
resources for a directed military attack -- nuclear arms, 
aircraft, tanks, and conventional arms -- are still there on a 
frightening scale. 
  Russia's problems are probably more to do with low morale 
and 
a lack of discipline that lead to a deterioration in the 
capacity to develop military effectiveness on a large scale. 
  It is not easy today to put forward long-term prognoses for 
developments in Russia. Things could move off in any direction 
at all and we should probably accept this uncertainty . 
  [Olofson] Have you ever noted that the defense industry, the 
intelligence service, and the whole of the military 
establishment have an interest in upholding a threat scenario? 
  [Wiktorin] Personally I have no need of this. If the world 
moves in a peaceful direction and the surrounding world disarms, 
we should do so too. There is no reason to maintain expensive 
defense forces as a goal in itself. I am no preserver of 
organizations. 
  [Olofson] Today the defense forces are too little in favor 
of conscription. Many people want to do their national service, 
but are not allowed to, others do not, but are forced to. How 
do you want to solve this problem? 
  [Wiktorin] I am an advocate of universal conscription, not a 
professional army. But combat units have to have quality and 
training. Already today it is impossible within the defense 
budget we have to go back to full universal conscription. This 
would be too expensive and would lead to excessive numbers and 
the quality side of training would be lost. 
  Nevertheless, if we choose to retain universal conscription, 
a solution which could help to solve the problems is short-term 
training for conscripts lasting two to three months for guard 
duties in the framework of the Home Guard, for example. 
  But I will not be heavy-handed in pushing the call for 
short-term training. The operational need militarily for guards 
with short-term training is not particularly great. 
  Political talks about conscription, about how we should 
solve 
the problems, should be given greater depth. A new system of 
conscription will not be on the agenda until after 1997.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias met in Istanbul 
with his U.S. counterpart, Warren Christopher, who asked Greece 
to disarm its fighter planes that engage in interceptions over 
the Aegean--as did Turkey--to reduce tension between the two 
countries. During a news conference, Christopher said he made 
this proposal believing that it would be very constructive if 
the Greek side replied positively. The U.S. secretary of state 
said Greece promised to study his request. 
  Correspondent Foivos Karzis reports on Papoulias' meetings 
in 
Istanbul: 
  [Begin recording] [Karzis] Papoulias met Stephen Oxman, the 
U.S. assistant secretary of state for European affairs, and 
mainly discussed the Cyprus issue. The Greek foreign minister 
stressed that the latest round of talks on Cyprus noted the 
clinical death of the confidence-building measures [CBM] 
procedure. Christopher disagreed with this evaluation. 
  Papoulias raised the issue of the Greek minority in Albanian 
with his Italian counterpart, Martino. They also discussed the 
issue of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, which took a new turn when 
35 Turkish deputies asked the Turkish National Assembly for an 
investigation into the activities of the Patriarchate. 
  At a news conference after the meeting of the two ministers, 
Papoulias said: 
  [Papoulias] I noted that this is an issue dealing with 
Greek-Turkish relations and that surely there would be no need 
to refer to this issue if Turkish airplanes did not violate 
national airspace. I asserted that raising one's voice does not 
create the necessary climate for overcoming the great 
difficulties in Greek-Turkish relations. I noted to Turkish 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin that unfounded allegations against 
Greece about the supposed support of terrorist activities are 
unacceptable and do not contribute to smooth bilateral 
relations. I called on him to inform us if there is any 
evidence. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today met his 
Turkish counterpart, Hikmet Cetin, on the sidelines of the NATO 
ministerial conference in Istanbul. The two ministers discussed 
the issues of artificial tension in Greek-Turkish relations and 
the Ecumenical Patriarchate's security. 
  The foreign minister described the meeting as positive and 
said he hopes there will be a positive results in the future. 
Papoulias added that he and his Turkish counterpart agreed that 
shrill diatribes do not help to create an appropriate climate to 
deal with the existing problems. He said unfounded accusations 
that Greece is supposedly backing terrorist organizations in 
Turkey are unacceptable. He also raised the issue of the recent 
attacks against the Patriarchate. Papoulias said he was 
satisfied with yesterday's statement by his Turkish counterpart 
denying Turkish press reports on Turkish Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller remarks. 
  The foreign minister said he and Cetin agreed to promote 
bilateral cooperation in combating drug trafficking and the 
issue of illegal immigrants. The two sides also agreed to 
promote the treaty on economic cooperation in the Black Sea and 
establish a cooperation bank in Thessaloniki. Cetin described 
the meeting as very useful and stressed that the two sides must 
closely follow actions that undermine the common view. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today that 
remarks by Cetin yesterday were more careful and moderate, 
adding that the government considers them an effort within the 
more general climate of artificial tension that is being 
cultivated by Turkey. Venizelos said the Government reacted 
carefully and calmly, adding that Cetin's remarks were positive. 
He stressed that Ciller's statement has significance, even if 
it was made in a private discussion. Greece has to ascertain 
Turkey's policy. 
  Asked if Ciller's remarks are linked to developments in the 
Cyprus issue, Venizelos said the Cyprus issue is an 
international problem, not a Greek-Turkish problem. He added, 
however, that Greek-Turkish relations depend on the Cyprus issue 
and whether Turkish Cypriot intransigence will continue. 
  Thirty-five Turkish deputies submitted a question in the 
Turkish National Assembly asking for an investigation into the 
activities of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. At a news conference 
at the National Assembly, the Turkish deputies referred to a 
betrayal of the Patriarchate and asked that decisive measures be 
adopted.

  [Text] Athens, June 9, IRNA -- Public order and security 
were among the issues which Greek Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias discussed with his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati in Tehran, Greek Government spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos told a regular press briefing Thursday [9 June]. 
  In reply to a Greek journalist's question if Papoulias 
raised 
the issue of "terrorism" during his talks, Venizelos replied 
that he discussed a number of topics with Velayati and other 
Iranian officials including the issues of public order and 
security. 
  Papoulias Wednesday flew to Istanbul after a two-day visit 
to 
the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Last month the british newspaper INDEPENDENT alleged that 
members of the greek guerrilla organisation `17 November' had 
met Iranian officials. 
  The news was also reported in the Greek press. Tehran 
rejected the report as "baseless and false."

<F P=106> [Report by Washington correspondent Alexis Papakhelas] </F>
  [Text] Greek foreign policy remains attached to the Skopje 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue. At 
the same time, Turkey manages--despite all its problems--to be 
strengthened both strategically and politically by Washington. 
The Clinton Administration is showing already, with very clear 
moves, that it is determined to continue arming Turkey 
excessively and even ignore its own concerns over the imbalance 
being created in the Aegean and the danger of a Greek-Turkish 
conflict. It is interesting that at such a time, when many U.S. 
analysts are concerned about the possibility of a "hot summer" 
in Greek-Turkish relations, that Washington is making new 
efforts to strengthen the Turkish war machine. 
  U.S. officials revealed to I KATHIMERINI that the White 
House 
has decided to approve granting five or six KC-135 
aircraft-tankers to Turkey. These are aircraft that can refuel 
fighter planes of the Turkish Air Force and will extend their 
range of action considerably. The decision was made by the 
White House interagency committee before Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou's visit to the U.S. capital, but was not announced to 
prevent it from spoiling the climate of Greek-U.S. relations. 
  This decision has already been conveyed to Congress. While 
it is not certain how many of these aircraft are involved, a 
Pentagon official said that the number may be 10. The Turkish 
Government will also have to pay a considerable amount of money 
to modernize the aircraft, as some of them were built in the 
1960's. 
  Another important development is President Clinton's 
decision 
to approve the transfer to Turkey of part of the money that was 
collected by former President George Bush to strengthen the 
Turkish armed forces. Mr. Bush had promised Turgut Ozal that he 
would collect $3.5 billion from the Arab countries (Kuwait, 
Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates) and the United States to 
finance the program to build 100 additional F-16 planes for the 
Turkish Air Force as well as for manufacturing F-16's for the 
Egyptian Air Force. 
  This sum was what Ozal collected for Turkey's stance during 
the Persian Gulf war. The United States contributed $500 
million, but it is not yet clear what budget it came from or 
whether it has been approved by Congress. It is certain that 
President Clinton approved the transfer of $1.2 billion for the 
strengthening of the Turkish war industry, apparently acting 
under the commitment of his predecessor. 
  Undoubtedly, we have to face a de facto disassociation of 
Washington's policy toward Ankara from the Athens-Washington 
relations. The U.S. Government is exploiting the Greek-American 
lobby's activity and the Greek foreign policy on the Skopje 
issue to promote the long-term plans for the strengthening of 
Ankara. As Senator Paul Sarbanes recently pointed out very 
correctly, the Greek foreign policy's expanding fronts have 
"tired" Congress and Washington in general. 
  However, Washington also shows "fatigue" on the Cyprus 
issue, 
which unfortunately has disappeared from the White House's list 
of priorities. The Americans exerted pressure on UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali to delay the release of his report because 
they wanted to give Rauf Denktas every opportunity to accept the 
confidence-building measures [CBM]. State Department officials 
insist--in briefings to Congress and during discussions with 
Turkish counterparts--that the Greek Cypriot leaders also do not 
really want the CBM's. 
  Consequently, the State Department leadership believes that 
pressure on the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot side alone is 
unfavorable and even... [ellipsis as published] unjust. Some 
analysts go one step further and for the first time begin to 
discuss a "final" scenario, which is based on the idea of 
recognizing the "pseudostate" and giving an official status to 
partition as quid pro quos for the return of all the Famagusta 
area to the Greek Cypriot community. This scenario is even 
being discussed at closed seminars and is the subject of 
confidential reports, while the U.S. agencies are again 
promoting the formula of a quadripartite conference to hold 
negotiations on all aspects of the Cyprus issue. 
  It is a fact that Washington rules out the adoption of 
measures against Turkey or the Turkish Cypriot community, 
particularly at a time when it believes that Turkish Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller is facing serious domestic problems. 
  It is always noteworthy that the mechanism of Turkey's 
supporters converts every development or problem into a reason 
for the support of Turkey. The inability to solve the Kurdish 
problem and the upsurge of Islamism make it necessary--according 
to this logic--for even more political, economic, and strategic 
strengthening of Turkey. The theory, which is being heard more 
often in closed seminars, that "Turkey will be the next Iran" 
concerns the Americans and urges them--in a rather strange 
manner--to adopt even more pro-Turkish directions. 
  There should be no doubt that Washington takes its 
relationship with Turkey very seriously. There is also no doubt 
that the most important U.S. promises for the strategic 
strengthening of Turkey were given during the Mitsotakis-Bush 
idyll and that these promises "were cashed in" during the 
Papandreou-Clinton idyll.

  [Text] Istanbul (AA) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has 
said that Turkey is justified regarding its requests concerning 
the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline. 
  Cetin was speaking after his 50-minute meeting with British 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd held during the North Atlantic 
Council meetings in Istanbul today. He said that he told his 
British counterpart that Turkey's sole aim is to save the 
pipeline. Cetin continued: 
  I explained to him that this cannot be compared to other 
countries' relations with Iraq, that it is a very special 
problem, and that we are justified in trying to save the 
pipeline. 
  Cetin noted that relations with the European Union [EU] were 
also discussed in detail at the meeting. 
  Recalling that Germany and France will be chairing the EU 
meetings consecutively as of July, Cetin said: We view this 
period as a significant one in Turkey's relations with the 
Customs Union as well as the EU. 
  Cetin stated that the situation in Iraq and the 
Azerbaijani-Armenian clashes were also discussed at the meeting. 
  Pointing out that they also dwelt on the benefits of 
extending the tripartite meetings process among Turkey, Britain, 
and Germany to include France as well, Cetin concluded by saying 
that the tripartite meetings can be converted into quadripartite 
ones.

  [Text] Istanbul (AA) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has 
announced that they have agreed with Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias to `introduce a new atmosphere' into 
Turkish-Greek relations. 
  Cetin and Papoulias met at the Ciragan Palace this 
afternoon. 
  Papoulias said that it is necessary to create `a good 
atmosphere' in order to overcome the problems in Turkish-Greek 
relations. He added, however, that this can only be achieved 
through the efforts of both sides. Cetin stated that mutual 
cooperation is needed to overcome misunderstandings. 
  In a statement after his meeting with Cetin, Papoulias said 
that `the meeting had gone well and that the results would be 
good.' 
  Pointing out that the two ministers decided to establish 
`habitual relations' to be attended by officials from their 
respective ministries, Papoulias further `welcomed' the 
statement made by Cetin on relations with Greece at his news 
conference yesterday. 
  Papoulias said: It is my personal view that this meeting was 
positive and that it will yield good results. 
  Also making a statement after the meeting, Cetin described 
his meeting with Papoulias as a `beneficial' one. 
  Noting that at the meeting they dwelt on the need to 
cooperate in order to prevent mutual misunderstandings, Cetin 
added: At the meeting we discussed the statements and comments 
made by the Turkish and Greek publics from time to time. It was 
very beneficial. We discussed refraining from behavior that 
might incite the public, that both sides should be careful on 
the issue and that there should be cooperation to prevent 
misunderstandings. 
  Cetin said that at the meeting Papoulias noted that Greece 
also suffers from terror and added: He told me that they are, 
therefore, ready to discuss the issue if there is any 
information on it, that they are ready to assess it and that 
they categorically do not and will not support terror. We also 
dwelt upon the fact that it will be beneficial to get together 
more frequently in order to develop relations. 
  Cetin later met with Douglas Hurd, British secretary of 
state 
for foreign and commonwealth affairs.

organization as a member, Ankara has warned the EU countries 
that they "will have to accept the consequences of south Cyprus 
becoming an EU member and that such a development will mark the 
end of the negotiating process in Cyprus." 
  It has been reported that the messages Ankara has conveyed 
to 
the EU countries at various levels can be taken to mean that the 
TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] will unite with 
Turkey if the Greek Cypriot side is admitted into the EU as a 
full member. Turkey defends the view that the Greek Cypriot side 
becoming an EU member will mean the de facto annexation of south 
Cyprus to Greece. 
  Meanwhile, a number of officials in Turkey have maintained 
that several points in UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's report on Cyprus, which has elicited strong 
reaction in Turkey, can be justified. A Turkish Foreign 
Ministry official has said that the fact that Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali has agreed that the Cyprus problem has continued 
for 30 years is "a very positive development." The Greek 
Cypriots have maintained that the Cyprus problem was created as 
a result of Turkey's intervention in the island in 1974. 
Furthermore, Ankara has regarded Butrus-Ghali's view that "the 
limited UN resources may be used to resolve other disputes" as a 
positive suggestion.

<F P=106> [Report by Yavuz Baydar in New York] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The report issued by the UN 
secretary general yesterday on the extension of the UNFICYP [UN 
Forces in Cyprus] mandate triggered harsh reaction both from 
Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC]. 
Ambassador Inal Batu, Turkey's permanent representative to the 
United Nations, described this new report as a text by the UN 
secretary general that ignores the wishes of the Turkish side on 
the island. 
  Osman Ertug, TRNC representative in New York, said that the 
report pours salt on the wounds. Turkish Cypriot officials say 
that the report, like the previous one, is politically oriented, 
whereas it should have been primarily a technical report. 
  Ertug said: In our view, the fact that the accusation 
concerning the lack of political will is directed -- even though 
only by implication -- against the Turkish Cypriot side 
constitutes the most dangerous factor in the report.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by Seyyat Agababali and Kabil Huseyinli </F>
from Istanbul on 9 June; recorded] 
  [Text] [Agababali] President of Azerbaijan Geydar Aliyev 
arrived in this country for a brief working visit on 9 June at 
the invitation of Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. 
  President Suleyman Demirel, Istanbul Mayor Kozakcioglu, and 
other officials welcomed Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev at 
Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. President Aliyev inspected the 
guard of honor. Afterwards, Geydar Aliyev and Suleyman Demirel 
made statements to the press at the airport. Later the two 
presidents held a private meeting at Demirel's residence in 
Istanbul, after which Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev 
received British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd, who is on a 
visit to Istanbul. Dear listeners, after this brief report on 
the president's visit, I now give the telephone to state adviser 
Kabil Huseyinli. 
  [Huseyinli] Today Istanbul has been transformed into the 
epicenter of world politics. This is because, alongside the 
NATO countries, delegates from 41 countries who have signed 
NATO's Partnership for Peace program have gathered in Istanbul. 
Truly, the most important political problems of the world are 
being examined here. From this angle, Azerbaijani President 
Geydar Aliyev's participation in such a high-level ceremony is 
undoubtedly of great importance for explaining Azerbaijan's 
problems to the world and thus initiating a search for a 
political solution to these problems. 
  It must also be noted that there were significant talks on 
these problems from the very first moments of the visit. Our 
president discussed a number of practical matters pertaining to 
a political solution in Daghlik-Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh] with 
Suleyman Demirel at Istanbul airport and during the meeting with 
British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd. The noteworthy fact is 
that the view is gaining ground that a solution to this sore 
spot of the world might henceforth be achieved mostly through 
international organizations. This issue will be discussed in 
more detail during talks tomorrow morning, and practical ways to 
resolve the problem within the CSCE framework will be examined 
once more. The Azerbaijani president's participation in these 
high-level talks and the expected allocation of time to discuss 
the Daghlik-Karabakh problem at this meeting will undoubtedly 
bring a political solution of this problem closer. 
  Dear listeners, we want to conclude our report from Istanbul 
with Suleyman Demirel's statement at the airport. Turkish 
President Suleyman Demirel said that it is a shame for the major 
world powers to turn a blind eye to these occupationist 
developments in Azerbaijan, and that he will discuss these 
matters with the U.S. secretary of state.

  [Text] Istanbul, June 9 (A.A.) -- President Suleyman 
Demirel on Thursday [9 June] said that Azerbaijan has suffered 
great losses from the Armenian invasion, adding responsible 
countries should not remain spectators to this situation. 
  He called it a crime against humanity that the country 
should 
be left in this situation adding that 1.2 million people have 
become refugees and that a very harsh winter has led to heavy 
losses. 
  Demirel said that it is unacceptable that a country seizes 
another country's territories by force and in this situation it 
is impossible that Turkey establish good relations with the 
invading country, Armenia. 
  He said Turkey will take steps to bring peace in the region 
and will continue to voice the injustices done to Azerbaijan, 
adding he will take up the issues during his meeting with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
  Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev said that a number of 
agreements have been signed with two friendly countries Turkey 
and Azerbaijan and that bilateral high level meetings are also 
contributing to the development of relations.

the Montreux Convention. Cetin declared: 
  [Begin Cetin recording] If necessary, we can clarify some of 
the issues again and explain that they do not violate the 
Montreux Convention. It is possible that some technical issues 
are not entirely clear, but Turkey cannot allow a city of 10 
million people to be threatened. A new arrangement is 
absolutely necessary, and the Russians also concede this point. 
[end recording] 
  Cetin added that the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict and the 
Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline issues were also discussed with 
Kozyrev.

  [Text] Ankara--A series of mystery murders in the past week 
have prompted allegations that some State forces in Turkey are 
linked to a systematic campaign to intimidate pro-Kurdish 
businessmen and politicians. On Saturday [4 June] a group of 
fishermen discovered the bodies of pro-Kurdish businessman Savas 
Buldan and two of his colleagues, Haci Koray and Adnan Yildirim 
near the Melen river in the Yigilca township of Bolu province. 
The three had been shot in the back of the head. Police 
sources said the three had also been tortured and were without 
identification papers when found. Relatives identified the 
bodies which were brought to Istanbul on Sunday. 
  Buldan was a wealthy Istanbul businessman who is in the 
hotel 
and restaurant business. He comes from the township of 
Yuksekova in the southeastern province of Hakkari. His 
colleagues Koray was also from Yuksekova while Yildirim came 
from the township of Lice in Diyarbakir province. Buldan's 
brother Necdet Buldan is the former mayor of Yuksekova and 
belongs to the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP). The killings 
follow the killing of Muhsin Melik and his driver in the 
southeastern provincial center of Urfa by four or five 
unidentified persons. Melik is the founder of the People's 
Democrat Party (HADEP), a new pro-Kurdish party set up to 
eventually replace DEP. Melik was the former provincial chairman 
of DEP. 
  Before his death Melik reportedly told his brother that he 
had been shot by plainclothes policemen just outside his office. 
Melik allegedly shot and wounded one of his assailants. The 
governor of Urfa said two persons were in custody related to the 
murder. 
  Buldan and his two companions were allegedly taken into 
custody by a group of policemen outside Istanbul's Cinar Hotel. 
The persons who apprehended them reportedly showed their police 
identification cards and then took them away in unmarked cars, 
according to the personnel of the Cinar Hotel who witnessed the 
incident. 
  The death of Buldan was the latest in a chain of murders 
committed against persons who allegedly have links with Kurdish 
separatist militants. The first case concerned pro-Kurdish 
underground figure Behcet Canturk and his driver Recep Kuzucu 
who were found murdered near the Sapanca section of the 
Istanbul-Ankara highway. Canturk was also from the Lice 
township. 
  Later the body of Canturk's lawyer Yusuf Ziya Ekinci was 
found near Ankara's Golbasi district in February. He had been 
killed by seven bullets. 
  In March another prominent figure from Lice, contractor 
Fevzi 
Arslan, and his brother Sahin were kidnapped at gun point in 
their Aksaray office in Istanbul and their bodies were later 
found on the Istanbul-Ankara highway. 
  Buldan was previously taken into custody in 1992 when 
police raided his house in Istanbul and discovered he was 
hosting DEP Diyarbakir Deputy Leyla Zana, her husband Megdi Zana 
and seven other people who were allegedly linked to the outlawed 
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). There were claims that Buldan 
had provided PKK with guns and financial aid. He was later 
released. Conservative Turkish papers claimed Buldan may have 
been killed by the mafia because of drug trafficking. 
  Pro-Kurdish daily Ozgur Ulke, however, pointed the finger at 
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and said the prime minister had 
warned on November 4, 1993 that the government has information 
about businessmen and other personalities who give extortion 
money to the PKK and had threatened to "make them pay." The 
paper claimed Ciller was now making the businessmen "pay." 
Ozgur Ulke quoted former National Intelligence Organization 
(MIT) member Professor Mahir Kaynak as saying "the murders were 
planned by those who had provided the list of pro-Kurdish 
businessmen to the prime minister." Kaynak also said the 
murders were being planned and carried out by those in the State 
cadres who do not want a political solution to the Kurdish 
problem. The Turkish Daily News learnt that at first police had 
confirmed Bulan and his friends had been taken into custody but 
later denied this. The Bulan family members reportedly had some 
sources inside the police and they alleged that they were told 
"do not follow up your complaints." 
  Buldan's brother contacted Deputy Prime Minister Murat 
Karayalcin who allegedly told him "this matter is way above my 
head." Meanwhile, in Ankara DEP officials charged also that 
Muhsin Melik was killed by police in Urfa. DEP Acting Chairman 
Remzi Kartal said the police were at the scene of the incident 
only two minutes after Melik was shot. Melik was then wounded 
and refused to get into the police car saying "you are the 
people who shot me." 
  Kartal said eye witnesses identified the license plate of 
the 
car used in the murder of Melik as 06 ED 246. It was a white 
Renault Broadway. He claimed a similar car was seen being 
driven into the Urfa police headquarters the same day carrying a 
wounded person. Kartal claimed "those who oppose state policies 
are either silenced or eliminated."

Democracy Party," HADEP Chairman Murat Bozlak said Monday [6 
June]. "The government is under an obligation to find the 
murderers, especially since it was reported to officials that 
the three men had gone missing," he added. "The state is under 
suspicion until it finds those responsible." 
  Buldan and his two companions were allegedly taken into 
custody by a group of policemen outside Istanbul's Cinar Hotel. 
The persons who apprehended them reportedly showed their police 
identification cards and then took the three men away in 
unmarked cars, according to the personnel of the Cinar Hotel who 
witnessed the incident. 
  DEP Acting Chairman Remzi Kartal, meanwhile, appealed to 
President Suleyman Demirel "to find those who are responsible 
for the killings." 
  "The government, the Parliament and the media are 
insensitive. We do not have anywhere to turn," Kartal said.

  [Text] Ankara--In the opening speech of the Emergency State 
Coordination Council meeting held in Ankara at the Gendarmerie's 
social complex on Monday [6 June], Interior Minister Nahit 
Mentese said, "Turkey is being manipulated by foreign centers of 
power." Mentese stressed that all ethnic groups living in 
Turkey have equal rights. "People who talk of a Kurdish entity 
or equal political rights are playing with words. Whose 
identity or political rights are we talking about?" 
  Criticizing the outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), 
he 
said, "The PKK terror organization has diverted the issue and 
has been operating behind a false claim, mainly that the 
fighting is being conducted for the sake of the Kurdish identity 
and the freedom of the Kurdish people." 
  The interior minister blamed the creation of a "Kurdish 
problem" on certain centers of power, which he said have 
intentionally projected this image to the public based on 
unfounded and groundless claims. 
  Mentese emphasized the tolerant atmosphere in the country by 
claiming that "there is no differentiation between Kurdish, 
Turkish, Circassian, Bosnian, and Albanian citizens of Turkey. 
Everybody is free to choose his or her profession freely and 
the same is true for our Kurdish citizens." He concluded that, 
"Therefore, these accusations result from games played by 
foreign centers of power." 
  During the speech, Mentese also said that people who murder 
babies, women, children and the elderly without any hesitation, 
hiding behind the cover of "fighting for the salvation of the 
Kurdish people," cannot be tolerated and accepted. 
  Referring to the harsh living conditions in the Southeast, 
Mentese said: "The current situation in the Southeast cannot be 
interpreted as a `Kurdish problem.' The problem is the 
geographic nature and position of the region. Due to this, 
neither the government nor the private sector has been able to 
make investments to reverse the existing economic conditions or 
to assist in the creation of jobs in the region. Necessary 
measures will be taken to upgrade the living standards in the 
region." 
  The interior minister assured the audience that necessary 
socioeconomic measures have already been taken to encourage the 
development of the region and attract investors. 
  As the purpose of the gathering was to seek ways of 
establishing an environment of peace and security in the 
Southeast, many government officials from a variety of 
ministries attended the meeting. Attendees included the 
undersecretaries from the ministries of Foreign Affairs, 
National Security, Justice, Finance, Education, Agriculture, 
Forestry, Public Works and Housing, Labor and Social Security 
and Transportation. The undersecretary of the National 
Intelligence Organization (MIT) also participated in the event 
as did the Higher Education Council (YOK) president, the general 
director of the Youth and Sports Ministry, the undersecretary of 
the Emergency State Coordination Council and a representative 
from the general staff of the Turkish Armed forces.

<F P=106> [Article by Ergun Aksoy: "Heavy Blow to Hezbollah"] </F>
  [Text] Security forces reportedly arrested 22 militants of 
the "Menzil" branch of Hezbollah, including its "jihad director" 
Emin Teysi, in an operation against the "Menzil" and "Ilim" 
branches of Hezbollah. Diyarbakir State Security Court (DGM) 
noted that the suspects interrogated were responsible for 
carrying out more than 30 perpetrator-unknown killings. The 
leader of the Menzil branch, which aims to establish an 
independent Kurdish state based on Islamic principles, is wanted 
in Istanbul, it was announced. 
  In the southeast, where approximately 1,600 unresolved 
killings have been committed since 1990, the operation is 
reportedly continuing against Hezbollah, called "Contra-Hezbol" 
by some. The Menzil branch of Hezbollah has reportedly been 
largely wiped out as a result of the operations concentrated in 
Diyarbakir, Batman, Silvan, and Van. Twenty-two of the 
organization's militants were arrested along with the head of 
its military wing (jihad director) Emin Teysi. Twelve weapons 
used in actions were also seized along with the militants, and 
more than 30 unresolved killings were cleared on discovering 
that the suspects were responsible for them, it was stated. Emin 
Teysi and the 22 militants are now under interrogation at the 
Diyarbakir DGM. The investigation will reportedly be completed 
this week. 
<H5>  Mumcu, Ucok, Aksu </H5>
  Speaking to CUMHURIYET, Diyarbakir DGM authorities said that 
the militants' activities were concentrated in the southeast. 
"They have no connection with the well-known murders of Ugur 
Mumcu, Bahriye Ucok, Muammer Aksoy, Mehmet Sincar, and Musa 
Anter. The organization has two leaders, but they have not been 
apprehended yet. We sent wanted notices for these two persons to 
all units. They are most likely in hiding in Istanbul." 
Authorities pointed out they were unable to establish any link 
between the Menzil members and Iran and said that the 
organization's goal is "to establish an independent Kurdish 
state based on Islamic principles" in the southeast. Authorities 
said: 
  "We can describe the Menzil branch as a splinter group 
broken 
off from the Ilim group, but there is not much information about 
the reasons for the split. These two groups are still fighting. 
Many of the killings committed by the Menzil members are 
directed at Ilim members. Actions against the PKK [Workers Party 
of Kurdistan] and PKK sympathizers are relatively few. The 
Menzil is a new movement. They presented themselves to the 
public as an antiviolence movement when they first emerged. 
However, they have changed their policies in the past year and 
become defenders of violence. They want to get their own forces 
accepted instead of the Ilim branch. They want to be sole 
leaders of the organization." 
<H5>  Ilim Branch </H5>
  The Ilim branch of the Hezbollah which has defended armed 
struggle since its origin reportedly has its headquarters in 
Diyarbakir. Huseyin Velioglu, a native of Batman who is said to 
be the leader of the Ilims, who meet near the Ilim Library, 
reportedly has connections with Iran. It was noted that security 
forces do not have much information about the Ilims, whose 
organization resembles Iranian Hezbollah. Diyarbakir DGM 
authorities said the following in relation to the Ilim branch of 
Hezbollah: 
  "Ilim is a more dangerous movement than Menzil. Members of 
the Ilim group have been arrested, but we cannot get a breakdown 
of the organizational structure because they are only from the 
ranks. Hezbollah is called the `Party of God,' but we have no 
information as to whether Ilim and Menzil are connected with the 
true Hezbollah in Iran and Lebanon. However, we have heard that 
the Ilim group is close to the Iranian Hezbollah and its 
militants are trained in Iran. It is difficult to draw an 
organization chart as long as no top level administrators can be 
apprehended."

<F P=106> [Article by Nursun Eren: "Election Bill High"] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--The best example of an election economy is 
seen in the Central Bank's actions. It sold foreign exchange 
worth $6.857 billion on the market in the past six months, thus 
reducing its foreign exchange reserves to $3.29 billion as of 8 
April. The Central Bank's available foreign exchange reserve is 
reportedly down to $600 million. 
  Economic circles are stressing that the political 
responsibility for developments lies with the government, 
commenting, "The refusal to take serious measures on the eve of 
elections and just selling lots of foreign exchange virtually 
put the brakes on exchange rates, and 100 trillion lira [TL] in 
profits were distributed. Is no one going to ask for 
accountability in this?" 
  According to information obtained by CUMHURIYET from Central 
Bank circles, the Central Bank's foreign exchange sales began to 
"climb" in November last year and reached a record level in 
March, when local elections were held. In March alone, $2.2 
billion in foreign exchange was sold on the markets. 
<H5>  `Government Distributed Profits' </H5>
  Economic circles draw attention to the average exchange rate 
of TL15,000 to the dollar in the past six months and made the 
following evaluation: 
  "It was quite clear that there was an expectation of 
devaluation on the markets. However, the government, prior to 
the local elections, had the Central Bank sell a total of 
$6,857,192 in foreign exchange to force exchange rates to stay 
low so the markets would not experience this shock prior to the 
local elections, and a negative impression of the government 
would not be formed among the people. In other words, if you 
figure the average dollar exchange rate at TL15,000, over TL100 
trillion in profits were distributed. Central Bank reserves were 
at the level of $7.198 billion at the beginning of these 
operations, but dropped to $3.2 billion through depletion as 
profits. Only $600 million of these reserves are available for 
use at present. Is no one going to ask for accountability in 
this?" 
<H5>  Lost Donkey Found </H5>
  The same circles recall also that Prime Minister Ciller's 
U.S. trip was intended to "create fresh resources" and say the 
following: "In finding resources, the consequences are 
important. There is a saying: `Even the mountain cannot 
withstand it.' You are going to fritter away $6.8 billion in 5.5 
months, then get the U.S. president into the act to find $1 
billion. God willing, resources will be obtained, and we will be 
happy because we had lost our donkey and you found it." 
<H5>  Treasury Status </H5>
  It is pointed out that short-term advances "were completely 
used up" as a result of the Treasury's cancellation in recent 
months of perpetual contracts and insistence on low interest. 
Because the Treasury could not have recourse to short-term 
advances in recent weeks to recover from its cash shortage, it 
is trying to finance itself by selling cash-equivalent bonds to 
the Central Bank. 
  Central Bank authorities point out that this was experienced 
also during the Gulf crisis and say that they have transferred 
TL10 trillion in cash to the Treasury in recent weeks by this 
method. 
<H5>  TL70 Trillion Expected </H5>
  While the tax laws sent to the Turkish Grand National 
Assembly are expected to create TL70 trillion in revenues, some 
say that this situation will increase the Treasury's domestic 
debt burden because of rising interest and that "one must at 
this point consider that TL70 trillion as already spent." 
  One official draws attention to the goal in the 1994 budget 
of paying TL216 trillion in principal and interest on domestic 
loans. 
  The official says, "Think of this figure as at least TL300 
trillion."

<F P=106> [Article signed MBO: "East European Drug Trafficking </F>
Prospers"] 
  [Text] The Russian drug empire is preparing to conquer West 
Europe. Western amphetamine laboratories (ecstasy and others) 
are moving one after another, mainly to Poland. From the 
Netherlands, hashish plants are being taken by truck, mainly to 
Russia. As soon as the drug mafia has established itself 
properly in the former East Bloc, much cheaper drugs will flood 
the West European market. The European Commission (EC) is 
preparing a large campaign against drug abuse. Interpol 
Secretary General Raymond Kendall in London called for the 
decriminalization of drug possession. 
  Drug trafficking from former East Bloc countries to West 
Europe are assuming disturbing dimensions. That was the 
conclusion of a three-day international conference on helping 
drug users which took place in the Russian town of Kaliningrad. 
Carlo Baeten of the Center for Alcohol and Drug Problems (CAD) 
in Hasselt was the only Belgian to attend and addressed an 
international group of specialists, at the invitation of the 
Narcotic Federation of Moscow. 
  "The drug abuse problem is growing enormously over there due 
to the lack of economic perspectives and any belief in the 
future among young people," Baeten said. "The drug mafia is 
throwing itself into this virgin territory. A daily dose of 
heroin costs scarcely 200 Belgian francs [BFr] over there 
compared with nearly BFr3,000 in Belgium. The Russian police 
are finding that an increasing number of amphetamine 
laboratories are starting up. They also know that there are new 
trafficking routes for heroin and cocaine. They are not just 
targeting the local market, but West Europe as well thanks to 
their competitive prices." 
<H5>  European Plan </H5>
  The EC has drawn up a plan for combating drug abuse. Its 
main points are: Reducing drug use and implementing 
preventative measures among high-risk groups (young people, 
prisoners); combating drug trafficking by more controls on money 
laundering, more cooperation between police, customs and justice 
departments and the expansion of Europol; international 
agreements at the United Nations and the Council of Europe 
levels and agreements with other countries. 
  The action program will start next year and last until 1999. 
The EC will set aside 960 million [currency not specified] for 
combating drug abuse. The number of addicts in the European 
Union is estimated at 1 million. Five million Europeans are 
believed to use drugs occasionally. 
  In London yesterday Raymond Kendall called for drug 
possession to be decriminalized. He believes that drug use is 
more of a social and health problem rather than a matter for the 
police. 
  "Combating symptoms is inefficient," Kendall said, expecting 
little benefit to be gained from the fight against drug dealers 
without tackling the problem situations which lead to drug use.

<F P=106> [Article by Christophe Boval: "Europe Dependent on Member </F>
States for Control on Subsidy Allocations"] 
  [Text] The European Commission (EC) has knowledge of 16 
billion Belgian francs [BFr] in illegally allocated subsidies or 
lost revenue in 1993. This amount represents 0.5 percent of the 
European budget and is just the tip of the iceberg. Estimates 
indicate that in fact 10 percent of European subsidies have been 
improperly allocated, of which a fraction only has been 
recovered. In the last 20 years, only just over 10 percent of 
identified fraud in the agricultural budget has been recovered. 
  The principal explanation for these poor results is that 
responsibility for combating fraud lies in the first instance 
with the national authorities. They alone have the police 
services and legal apparatus, carry out checks in the field, and 
notify the EC of cases of fraud. Although the Treaty of 
Maastricht expressly states that European states should combat 
fraud involving European money just as stridently as fraud 
involving their own money, in practice they put their own 
interests first. 
  This is especially true as far as subsidies from the 
structural funds for regional and social development are 
concerned. In this case, control is exercised by the very same 
authorities that request the money. Proposals to give the EC 
more powers in this area have encountered the opposition of 
member states, primarily Great Britain where politicians are 
nevertheless frequently given to complaining of fraud in the 
European Union (EU). 
  The EC's role is thus limited to coordination, support, and 
encouragement. Whenever an EC official is present on the spot, 
it is always announced in advance and he is accompanied by a 
national civil servant. The member states had even planned to 
trim the EC's antifraud budget, but the European Parliament put 
a stop to that. This year, as many as 50 experienced 
investigators may be involved in following up suspected fraud, 
which is nothing compared to the scale of the problem. 
  The second problem is the complexity of many regulations and 
directives. They virtually amount to an invitation to find the 
loopholes. Agricultural policy, which still swallows up half 
the EU budget, has certainly not been made any more transparent 
since the reforms. Europe has a budget for everything, from 
grants for suckling cows up until guaranteed prices for 
carcasses at a fixed weight, compensation for fallow land 
included. More limited policy areas, such as culture and 
consumer protection, are also teeming with subsidy 
possibilities. To be honest, obscure money transfers do not 
only occur in Europe. 
<H5>  Telephone Number </H5>
  A third problem is the lack of cooperation between national 
authorities. In order to know whether products really have been 
exported to a third country, they are dependent on documents 
from that third country. This is not always a simple matter. 
But even within the EU member states, the cooperation is far 
from perfect, and border controls have disappeared. There is no 
uniform definition of what exactly constitutes fraud of the 
agricultural budget and sanctions are not uniformly applied. 
  Faced with these problems, the EC is now seeking to appeal 
to 
the people themselves. It is planning to set up a free call 
number where citizens can report on suspected fraud while 
enjoying total anonymity.

<F P=106> [Marc Paoloni report: "Public Infrastructure: The Twelve </F>
Divided on Union Bonds"] 
  [Text] The European Union's image will not be tarnished by 
a quarrel on the funding of major European transport and energy 
networks. Finance ministers agreed yesterday in Luxembourg to 
recommend to heads of state and government that they only 
approve the list of 11 priority projects submitted to them. 
They considered that in the current state of affairs, a 
decision on a potential "Union Bond" issue could wait until the 
next European Council meeting, scheduled for next December in 
Essen. In other words, projects will go ahead and the Union 
will worry later about additional funding if need be. 
  Perfectly aware that the dispute has been taking a turn for 
the worse, the Twelve's finance ministers will no doubt be in a 
hurry to confirm this approach next Monday [13 June]. Jacques 
Delors himself seemed to have reconciled himself to the notion. 
That is, he appeared to accept that studies on priority 
projects should carry on without the European Council committing 
itself right away to letting the Union turn to capital markets 
in order to raise the funds needed to complement those already 
earmarked. The latter are funds to come from national public 
organizations, the EU budget, the European Investment Bank 
(EIB), and private investors. The notion of a large-scale 
"Union Bond" issue is therefore postponed indefinitely. 
  Of course, the quarrel appears rather preposterous in view 
of 
the actual amounts involved. These are rather trivial when 
compared to the Twelve's initial ambitions. The white paper 
approved at the Brussels Summit in December 1993 envisioned a 
ECU220 billion investment from 1994 to 1999, including ECU120 
billion to come from the Union. The problem was then to find 
another ECU8 billion annually to complete funds earmarked in the 
EU budget (ECU5 billion) and EIB loans (ECU7 billion) and hit 
the yearly target of ECU20 billion. 
  Today, the amounts at stake are much lower. According to 
estimates provided by European Commissioner Hennig 
Christophersen, the mark has now been lowered to a mere ECU32 
billion over six years for the various investments concerning 
the 11 priority projects. With maximum contributions of ECU3.8 
billion from the EU budget, ECU2 billion from the EIB (applying 
its 15 percent maximum participation rule), about ECU11 billion 
from member states, an estimated ECU1.6 from railway operators, 
and ECU7 to ECU8 billion from private investors, the shortfall 
would be a mere ECU4 to ECU5 billion by 2000. Nothing here that 
warrants starting an EU crisis! 
  True, the European Commission wanted a precedent-setting 
agreement in principle. However, one can understand most 
capitals -- with Paris foremost among them -- when they consider 
that this is no pressing issue. Especially since the EIB 
indicated on Monday in Luxembourg that it would strive to 
contribute more to the creation of the large networks under 
consideration. "Provided that projects are viable and member 
state determination and commitment are significant," EIB 
President Brian Unwin said. 
  So, in the coming months, the projects selected so far will 
be refined, with special attention being devoted to their cost 
and the financial arrangements that could be devised. In such a 
context, Brussels may try to show that such networks are 
intended to nurture an economic synergy and therefore that the 
self-funding approach is inappropriate: Instead, all regions 
and industries likely to benefit from such networks should be 
made to contribute more, one way or another.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by Thomas </F>
Sautner and Walter Osztovics; place and date not given: "As a 
Patriot One Must Vote for It"] 
  [Text] [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Mr. Minister, you will probably 
not want to hear this question anymore: How are you? 
  [Mock] (laughs) And you will probably not want to hear the 
answer anymore: Ask me on 13 June, after the referendum. No, 
seriously, I am very well. Just after the operation I was a bit 
suspicious, because I did not feel any pain at all anymore. The 
next two, three months will be important, then I can overdo it a 
bit again. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] You are not worried about your health, 
are 
you? But what about membership in the European Union [EU]? 
  [Mock] If one is dedicated to something, one is always a bit 
worried. But, in the end, I trust Austrians will understand. 
Voters realize that this is not just any election, but a 
decision that will determine the country's entire position for a 
long time to come. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] How would you evaluate the current EU 
debate, do you have any objections? 
  [Mock] Arguments like the ones that we have to supply water 
to Spain and must build nuclear power plants, are simply 
irresponsible, they annoy me. I respect anyone who votes "no" 
for certain reasons, but I do not respect such arguments. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Which brings us to the role of the 
opposition. You are one of those who do not exclude Freedom 
Party Chairman Joerg Haider from fundamental considerations. 
Will you stick to this position even if accession to the EU 
fails because of, among others, him? 
  [Mock] I have often talked with Haider and also with 
Voggenhuber [of the Greens], who certainly does not play second 
fiddle to Haider as regards rhetoric. Even in the case of 
failure we must continue to be ready to talk to each other. The 
fact that Haider is now often using excessive rhetoric is his 
business. It is profoundly regrettable for our country, but it 
does not excite me much. I do not think of Haider so highly 
that I would say that he alone has prevented membership. 
However, Haider's extremely harsh rhetoric is certainly not 
healthy for our country, and if the referendum fails, Haider 
will have to be held largely responsible for it, but the same 
also goes for the government. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Haider, who, until recently, said that 
the Austrian nation is a monstrosity, now argues that one must 
vote against membership of the EU out of patriotism for Austria. 
  [Mock] Quite apart from the problem that arises when such 
arguments come from this side, in particular as a patriotic 
Austrian one must vote for membership. Membership strengthens 
our country. One must also include history in one's 
considerations. In 1948, when the Marshall Plan was initiated 
and the first schedules were established: It was said, the 
Dutch need loans for seven or, I do not know, 10 years, the 
Germans for 15 years, just as the Belgians, and only for one 
country was no specific date set; this country was not viable, 
it had to be subsidized longer. This was Austria. And today 
one has to defend the fact that we are net payers. This is 
absurd. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What kind of feeling is it to know that, 
if the outcome of the referendum is yes, you will enter history 
as the foreign minister who led Austria into the EU? 
  [Mock] I do not know whether there is any way to examine 
whether, in 100 or 150 years, I will have entered history. Many 
people believed that they would figure in the history books and 
then did not find themselves there, others have been there for a 
very long time for good or bad reasons. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What would it mean for you personally if 
Austria became an EU member? 
  [Mock] In my political career, EU membership is the most 
important thing. I would be enormously glad if we became a 
member. I am really very dedicated to this matter. My heart is 
really in it. Austria would be able to have its say in Europe 
and would not be some sort of appendage. This would mean very 
much to me. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Do you see the future of the EU only in a 
rosy light or are there also dangers? 
  [Mock] The greatest danger is that integration is not yet 
irreversible. Making it irreversible requires another 
generation of forming an awareness and of interaction. Another 
outbreak of nationalism in the EU cannot be ruled out. And the 
demons of the past are, unfortunately, not yet dead. They are 
stored in the cupboard of history, and a wrong policy can bring 
them out again. The door to the cupboard has already been 
rattled, but it has remained shut so far --thanks also to Helmut 
Kohl, who has worked long on integration with great intensity. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Perhaps also out of fear of the strength 
of one's own country? 
  [Mock] Perhaps not out of fear, but out of concern, because 
if integration is reversed, if it fails, then, sooner or later, 
there will again be the realistic and great danger of a 
development toward war in Europe. One must also beware, also of 
oneself. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Could there be a problem for Austria if 
the EU referendum results in only a very narrow positive vote? 
  [Mock] Yes, this can be a problem, because then someone will 
naturally contest the referendum, and this may lead to a 
terrible mess and an enormous loss of reputation. Many 
countries are waiting for our referendum results: Switzerland, 
the Scandinavians. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] If the referendum were negative, could 
you 
then imagine that another referendum would be held soon 
afterwards? 
  [Mock] No, the opportunity would then be over for five, 10, 
20 years. The Norwegians, who said no in 1972, would be very 
happy today if they were already members. At that time there no 
Spanish and Portuguese, and fishing rights would not have been 
any problem. And, with all due respect, I would not want the 
Hungarians and the Poles to dictate the new conditions for 
membership to us at some time in the future. Now the 
negotiations were good, and this opportunity should be seized. 
There are even many in the EU who say that we have been given 
too much because we were so stubborn. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What historic significance does the 
result of the EU referendum now have for Austria? 
  [Mock] Apart from the State Treaty, this is the most 
important decision in the Second Republic. The State Treaty 
turned us into a member of the community of states again, and 
now there is the question of whether we want to remain a member 
in the future or to become a subject. It is strange that people 
say we must reform the EU from the outside and, at the same 
time, claim that, if we are inside, we have no say at all. For 
our country this is the most important decision for a long, long 
time to come. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] There are polls that say that you are 
enjoying the highest credibility both among advocates and 
skeptics. Is this not a reason for you to tell the voters: You 
are doing me a favor if you vote for the European Union? 
  [Mock] I think they are not doing a favor to me, but to the 
country if they vote yes. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Would you also consider announcing your 
resignation to influence voters? 
  [Mock] No, this would be the wrong thing. With this I would 
exert pressure, and this is not what I want to do. I want to 
convince them. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] There are many things that speak for 
Austria's membership in the EU. Some things speak against it. 
Which ones, for instance? 
  [Mock] There are a number of difficulties that we will face 
if we join the EU, for instance stronger competition or the 
adjustment of the monopolies to the free market. But without 
the EU we would have to implement even tougher reforms to be 
able to keep pace. Basically, we Austrians need much more self- 
confidence. One can acquire this more quickly abroad. I always 
feel five centimeters taller when I come home than I was when I 
left. At home they then make me feel two centimeters shorter 
again. But, I still end up three centimeters taller!. (He 
laughs) 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] On 10 June, two days before the EU 
referendum, you will celebrate your 60th birthday. Do you have 
any wishes for you birthday? 
  [Mock] First, that the Austrians give themselves the present 
of voting yes to be able to participate in decisionmaking as 
equals. Second, that they manage to maintain the ability to 
talk to each other despite the ups and downs of political 
developments, an ability acquired after World War II, and third, 
I want an increase in the standard of living, both in ethical 
and material terms, and the ability to work for something and 
not to get lost in complete passivity, as is currently happening 
in connection with Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Your altruism does you honor, but do you 
not have any private wishes? 
  [Mock] (laughs) I tell my private wishes to my wife. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What are you plans for the future, for 
the time after the referendum? Would you be available for 
another term as foreign minister? 
  [Mock] I feel comfortable with this task and, if I am 
called, 
I will be happy to be available for another term. But, you see, 
I am also pragmatic. I know that we all have our jobs only for 
a certain period.

<F P=106> [By S. C. Chang] </F>
  [Text] Ottawa, June 6 (CNA) -- Overseas Chinese Affairs 
Commission Chairman Chang Hsiao-yen arrived in Ottawa to a warm 
welcome Monday [6 June], the first cabinet minister of the 
Republic of China [ROC] to visit the capital city since Canada 
and Taiwan severed official ties in the early 1970's. Chang, 
who arrived from Vancouver where he attended the annual meeting 
of Overseas Chinese community leaders in North America, said he 
could feel the marked improvement in relations between Canada 
and the ROC. He had visited Ottawa in 1990 as chief of the 
ruling Kuomintang's Overseas Operations Department. After 
receiving flowers from ethnic Chinese representatives, he told 
reporters at the airport VIP lounge that in addition to meeting 
with Overseas Chinese in Ottawa, he will also call on some 
members of Parliament of Canada during his two-day stay. Chang 
will then proceed to Montreal and Toronto, two eastern Canada 
metropolises with large Chinese communities. As the top 
official in charge of Overseas Chinese affairs, he will seek 
their input and help resolve any problems. He recalled being 
welcomed by an 80-year-old Overseas Chinese carrying a walking 
stick, and expressed his deep appreciation for the love shown by 
Overseas Chinese toward the ROC founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen early 
in this century. "Chinese abroad are a growing source of power 
for our country," he said. "It's extremely important to pool 
their forces to serve our national goals." But he stressed 
that the ROC Government would not like to see its rivalry with 
the communist regime in Beijing "extended overseas."

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovene President Milan Kucan by </F>
correspondent Filippo Landi; place and date not given; Kucan 
speaks in Slovene with superimposed translation into Italian -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Among those countries that are keen to join the 
European Community is Slovenia, which has recently had some 
diplomatic disputes with Italy. Our correspondent, Filippo 
Landi, asked the President of Slovenia Milan Kucan, if today 
Slovenia considered Italy to be a hostile country. Let us hear 
what he had to say: 
  [Kucan] It is difficult to think of hostility between one 
state and another. Perhaps there are political orientations and 
parties, or even single individuals who are hostile. At this 
time it is difficult to evaluate official Italian policy with 
regard to Slovenia. We must wait and see what Italy's position 
will be and then we will decide. 
  [Landi] President, would you shake hands with a 
representative of the Italian Government who was also a member 
of the National Alliance? 
  [Kucan] For me shaking hands is a confirmation of the 
respect, of the willingness to talk to a person. The sole fact 
that an individual belongs to a different party, even if that 
party is a fascist one, is not sufficient reason not to shake 
hands. 
  [Landi] Slovenia wants to join the European Union, but in 
that case why is not possible to put an end -- as Italy is 
asking -- to the contentious dispute between the two countries, 
which is a consequence of World War II. 
  [Kucan] I do not understand Italy's position. Here we are 
talking about Slovenia joining the European Union. We must 
satisfy all the criteria, even the economic ones, in order to 
join Europe. We must also adhere to a general European policy. 
What you are talking about refers to a question that concerns 
only bilateral relations.

<F P=106> [Gallup Institute article for BERLINGSKE TIDENDE and Danish </F>
Radio: "Nordics Welcome in EU"] 
  [Text] Gallup has studied [Danish] popular opinion on the 
entry of Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria into the European 
Union (EU). 
  A majority 54 percent of the population believe that Nordic 
cooperation will be strengthened with the entry of the three 
Nordic neighbors into the EU. Only 15 percent think that 
cooperation will be weakened inside the EU, while 25 percent -- 
or one in four -- expect no change. In view of the many 
initiatives over the past four decades in Nordic cooperation -- 
including the Nordic Council -- it is quite interesting that a 
majority of Danes think that the EU can become a catalyst 
further promoting Nordic cooperation. 
  As many as 62 percent of yes voters in the 18 May [1993 
referendum] think that cooperation will be strengthened, while 
only 8 percent see it becoming weaker. Among the no voters there 
are somewhat fewer, specifically 43 percent -- who see a 
strengthening of Nordic cooperation, while more, namely 28 
percent, think it will be weakened. Accordingly, among both yes 
and no voters there are more who believe in a strengthening than 
in a weakening. 
  This positive attitude toward a peculiar "Nordic dimension" 
is also seen in that a large majority think it good that the 
Nordic countries become members in the EU. Sixty-eight percent 
are happy with a Swedish membership, 69 percent with a Norwegian 
membership, and 63 percent with a Finnish membership. At the 
same time, few -- namely around 12-13 percent -- think these 
countries' membership in the EU is a bad prospect. The fourth 
applicant country, Austria, is welcomed by 62 percent. Regarding 
Iceland, a Nordic nonapplicant, two out of three Danes (66 
percent) say they would welcome that country if it wanted to 
apply for EU membership. 
  If Danes are asked what they think the results will be in 
the 
EU-entry referendums, it appears that a majority does not think 
Norway will follow the other three applicants into the EU. 
Fifty-five percent of Danes believe that the Norwegian 
referendum will end with a no, while 34 percent -- or one in 
three -- believe in a Norwegian yes. On the other hand, most 
Danes think that referendums in the three other applicant 
countries will end in a yes vote for membership in the EU. 
  The Gallup survey was conducted 19-25 May 1994. A 
representative sample of 1,004 Danes over age 18 were 
interviewed by phone.

<F P=106> [Report by Emily von Sydow/FINSKA NOTISBYRAN: "EU Subsidy </F>
for Agriculture 3 Billion More Than Expected"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- In the debate on Finland's national 
support package for agriculture almost 3 billion markkas from 
the European Union's [EU] agricultural budget has "disappeared" 
in the calculations. This money is to compensate farmers for 
the fall in agricultural prices and means that the agricultural 
subsidy for 1995 from the EU to Finland is 7 billion and not 4 
billion markkas. 
  This means that the Finnish taxpayers' additional 
contribution for 1995 to farmers will be 1 billion and not 4 
billion markkas -- the figure that has been mentioned hitherto. 
This has been confirmed by Finnish agricultural experts in 
Brussels. 
  The package that resulted from the membership negotiations 
contains a provision that for four years Finland will receive 
738 million ECU's (a little over 4.7 billion markkas) from the 
EU's so-called agrobudgetary package. It is this money that is 
to compensate farmers for the fall in prices (a 50-percent fall 
in prices for agricultural products from the first day of 
membership). 
  The other candidate countries with a high level of 
agricultural subsidies also received similar compensation. 
Sweden also received money under this same heading, despite the 
fact that it has already adjusted its prices to the EU level. 
This is a scarcely disguised budget rebate. 
  The calculation of the national support package is very 
complicated and Prime Minister Esko Aho, who yesterday visited 
Brussels, had his work cut out to explain the need for the 
package to EU Commission President Jacques Delors and Belgian 
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. 
  "We met with the reaction we expected. The Commission will 
have to undertake a swift investigation of the package, so that 
we can have its conclusions in good time before the referendum. 
On this we are agreed," Aho said after his meeting with Delors, 
not going into any details about what Delors' reaction actually 
was. 
  Aho said at least that he had not encountered any 
"insurmountable" difficulties for Finland's national 
agricultural support package. 
  "There is bound to be pretty thorough discussion of some 
points, but the fundamental outlines of the support package will 
probably remain unchanged," Aho said. 
  He refused to say what details in the package the Commission 
is expected to take an especially careful look at. 
  The Commission will scrutinize the national support package 
to see whether it conflicts with the EU's rules. The most 
important thing from the Commission's viewpoint is whether the 
subsidies for farmers and the food industry can be considered to 
distort competition. This would anger farmers in the other 
member nations. 
  One of Aho's main arguments for the national subsidy package 
is that Finland's farmers receive less support than EU farmers 
in Central Europe, since the most important part of the EU's 
agricultural subsidy is related to production. The greater 
production, the bigger the contribution from the EU, and this 
would leave Finland's relatively low-production farmers with 
smaller contributions. 
  The Commission has been critical that Finland has made 
available so little information about the package in the period 
in which it had been prepared. 
  "We could not negotiate with the EU before the decisions on 
the package were made at home, and in my view we have given the 
EU good advance information," Aho said before the meeting. 
  Aho fears that the strongly critical discussion at home in 
Finland could threaten the package's acceptance by the EU, and 
said that he thinks that the whole discussion has been derailed. 
  On the subject of next week's confidence vote, Aho said that 
it will decide whether Finnish EU membership has any future. 
Without the national subsidy package there is no chance, he 
said. 
  "The Eduskunta decided two years ago that Finland should 
apply for EU membership on the present base. If the Eduskunta 
does not consider that it is defensible, I do not think that 
there is any other point of departure from which Finland could 
become a member of the EU," Aho said. 
  Asked whether he considers it important that Pertti 
Salolainen should remain in the government, Aho replied "yes." 
  The delicate subject of Delors' successor was also debated 
over lunch with the Belgian prime minister. Dehaene himself is 
the French-German favorite for Delors' successor. 
  "Dehaene and I have a number of divergent views, about 
federalism in Europe (decisions at central level rather than in 
individual countries), for example, but Dehaene seems to be a 
pragmatic federalist and would probably not be a bad choice for 
president of the Commission," Aho said. 
  The prime minister also said that he does not want to mix 
together a possible election to the European Parliament and 
Finland's Eduskunta elections in March next year. 
  "It is better that the Euroelections take place at the same 
time as the local elections," Aho said.

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin is continuing his 
bilateral contacts with foreign ministers who are currently in 
Istanbul for the North Atlantic Cooperation Council meetings. 
This morning, Cetin met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. 
  In a joint statement issued with Christopher, Cetin said 
that 
bilateral relations, the Cyprus problem, the oil pipeline, and 
issues such as the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict were discussed 
during the meeting. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement he issued later, Cetin declared that the U.S. 
House of Representatives decision to cut aid to Turkey is 
unacceptable. 
  [Begin Cetin recording] I informed Christopher that linking 
25 percent of aid to certain conditions is unacceptable to the 
Turkish public and the Turkish Government and that the U.S. 
Administration must use the necessary influence in the coming 
days to rectify this. I also expressed Turkey's satisfaction 
that the request concerning 10 [word indistinct] planes has been 
referred to the U.S. Congress. Moreover, we discussed the need 
for the U.S. Administration to continue its efforts for the 
positive conclusion of this matter in Congress. [end recording] 
  Cetin explained that in principle, Christopher was positive 
about the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline issue, and the work on 
this subject will continue in the coming days. The conflict 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia was also discussed during the 
talks, Cetin reported, adding that it would be wrong to take the 
issue to platforms other than the CSCE. 
  Cetin later met with Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki 
Haavisto. Bilateral political and economic relations were 
discussed during the meeting.

  [Text] Ankara (CUMHURIYET BUREAU)--While the DYP [True Path 
Party] looks coolly on the request to "implement Article 119 of 
the Constitution" presented to President Suleyman Demirel by 
businessmen Sakip Sabanci and Vehbi Koc, DSP [Democratic Left 
Party] General Chairman Bulent Ecevit announced that he is 
definitely opposed to such a move. Former Finance Minister and 
DYP Deputy General Chairman Sumer Oral said that the situation 
is not such as to require application of Article 119. 
  Sumer Oral pointed out that the president replied to the two 
businessmen that "there is no need for such a move." He said, "I 
do not see any need to invoke Article 19 of the Constitution 
under the present circumstances." 
  Businessmen Sabanci and Koc presented a proposal to 
President 
Demirel that he exercise his constitutional authority to "chair 
the Council of Ministers in serious economic crises" on the 
rationale that Turkey is experiencing "a serious economic 
crisis." Demirel, however, noted that there is a coalition 
government in office and replied, "There is no need for this at 
present." 
  The two businessmen's proposal to Demirel angered Finance 
Minister Ismet Attila. He pointed out that the president "does 
not act at just anyone's behest" and stressed that there is no 
question of any "economic straits" such as to invoke Article 119 
of the Constitution by reason of "economic crisis." He said: 
"The situation the country is experiencing must not be 
exaggerated. At any rate, it is not grave enough to invoke 
certain consitutional provisions. There is a government, and it 
has taken all necessary measures. Moreover, the place for 
discussion and reaching consensus on topics like this is the 
government, not business. This is a separate matter, of course. 
Moreover, even if there were such a situation, the president 
cannot act on his own. These things do not take place just by 
someone's saying so. We took the necessary measures, all that 
need to be taken, during the first three months." 
  Attila suggested that there are those who are trying to gain 
an advantage from this by creating an atmosphere of panic and 
said, "Those who have no love for the country or its people are 
the ones doing this; our political rivals are doing this. They 
are saying, `It will affect foreign exchange rates,' they are 
saying, `Withdraw our money.' But I repeat, all necessary 
measures have been taken. There is definitely no need for such 
an emergency or anything similar." 
  DSP General Chairman Bulent Ecevit called a news conference 
yesterday at which he said the following: ``I am definitely 
opposed. I would hope that the report is not serious. I told the 
distinguished prime minister: What ought to be done is to 
convene the `economic and social council' that is a part of the 
government program but has not been implemented to date. 
  ``With this council, on which workers, farmers, employers, 
and the government would be represented, an approach must be 
followed based on voluntary solidarity on overcoming the 
problem.'' 
  Article 119 of the Constitution authorizes the president to 
proclaim martial law for six months "in periods of great crisis" 
in the country. Article 119 reads: "In conditions of natural 
disaster, dangerous infectious diseases, or serious economic 
crisis, the Council of Ministers meeting under the chairmanship 
of the president may proclaim a state of emergency, not to 
exceed a period of six months, in one or more areas of the 
country or nationwide."

  [Text] Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas today clarified 
the Turkish Cypriot side's positions on the confidence-building 
measures, as they were expressed on 6 May. Denktas made the 
clarification in a meeting this afternoon with Gustave Feissel, 
the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in 
Cyprus, in the occupied areas. 
  In a statement at the Ledra Palace Hotel roadblock, Feissel 
said the clarifications basically concerned the issue of access 
to Famagusta. He said there are some positive developments in 
comparison to the positions expressed by Denktas on 6 May, but 
added that it is uncertain if these developments will lead to 
the desired outcome. The UN envoy said he will brief the UN 
secretary general by tomorrow, who will then inform the Security 
Council.

  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has 
suggested that the UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] mandate be 
renewed for another six months. In his report, which circulated 
tonight, the UN secretary general mentions that UNFICYP's 
presence is still necessary to achieve the Security Council's 
goals. 
  The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent reports 
from New York that the UN secretary general is concerned with 
the lack of progress in the reduction of troops and armaments in 
Cyprus. He blames the Turkish side for the fact that talks have 
not begun on disarmament in Cyprus and on prohibition of using 
arms along the buffer zone other than sidearms. Butrus-Ghali 
also mentions that concern for the lack of progress in this 
sector intensifies if one considers the lack of political will 
that was apparent in the latest efforts to agree on the 
confidence-building measures. 
  The UN secretary general adds in his report that he has 
informed Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller of President 
Glavkos Kliridhis' demilitarization proposal. Butrus-Ghali says 
that the Turkish Government replied that the Turkish Cypriot 
community is the appropriate party to decide on that proposal. 
He also mentions that military equipment on both sides in 
Cyprus has been upgraded and that the number of Turkish troops 
on the island has risen to 30,000. The UN peacekeeping force in 
Cyprus numbers 1,250 men, 110 less than the number provided for.

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the 
Cypriot Government considers UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's report on the renewal of the UNFICYP mandate in 
Cyprus objective. 
  Kasoulidhis said it is important to note that Butrus-Ghali 
describes occupied Cyprus as one of the most highly militarized 
areas in the world in terms of the ratio between numbers of 
troops and civilian population. He added that a positive point 
is that the UN secretary general explicitly rejected Turkish 
claims that our side creates tension along the confrontation 
zone.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis concluded from 
his talks in Moscow that Russia believes now is the right time 
for a new approach in the efforts to promote a Cyprus solution. 
Returning to Cyprus tonight, Mikhailidhis said Russia is 
showing an intense interest in the Cyprus issue. He added that 
he and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev discussed two of 
the alternatives suggested by the UN secretary general in his 
report on the confidence-building measures [CBM], that is, the 
exchange of views and the convening of an international 
conference on the Cyprus issue, as Russia had suggested. 
  Commenting on the possibility that the UN secretary general 
will submit a supplementary report on the talks on the CBM's, 
Mikhailidhis said such an action is completely unjustified and 
not in line with general procedures.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis will go to New 
York this afternoon to brief the UN secretary general and the 
members of the Security Council on the positions of the Cypriot 
Government on the Cyprus issue. 
  In a statement after meeting President Glavkos Kliridhis 
this 
morning, Mikhailidhis said his meetings with the Security 
Council members will begin on Monday [13 June], adding that he 
expects to meet Butrus-Ghali on Thursday or Friday. He said the 
goal of these meetings is to convey the positions of the Cypriot 
Government on the current state of the Cyprus issue as it has 
evolved since the UN secretary general submitted his report. 
Mikhailidhis added: It is well known that negotiations are 
being held among the Security Council permanent members on 
future steps for the Cyprus issue. 
  On his way to New York, the foreign minister may stop in 
Athens to meet his Greek counterpart, Karolos Papoulias. 
Mikhailidhis said he and Papoulias will exchange views on the 
handling of the Cyprus issue. He will also meet Greek Foreign 
Ministry officials to discuss the European Union-Cyprus fourth 
financial protocol.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "British Provocations"] </F>
  [Text] The British Government brutally "dealt us a blow" 
for the third time within a few days. Frankly, cynically, and 
unhesitatingly, Britain has proved its pro-Turkish stance by 
blocking the European Union [EU]-Cyprus fourth financial 
protocol. 
  The Greek presidency's draft plan on the financial protocol 
struck a chord of British reaction. During the meeting of the 
permanent representatives of the EU member states the day before 
yesterday, the British spokesman insisted on securing financing 
for the pseudostate without the necessary consent of the lawful 
Cypriot Government. This British stance exhausts Cypriot 
Hellenism's final margin of patience. In an initial reaction, 
President Glavkos Kliridhis said that if something like this 
happens, we will not accept the EU fourth financial protocol. 
  The president's reaction is correct. But the president, the 
government, and the House of Representatives must not limit 
their reaction to just that. As we have stressed in recent 
reports because of other British blows against us, we are 
obliged to react accordingly. We must react dynamically. Why 
not even strike back at Britain? We are in a position to do it. 
We have the power and the means to harm many of Britain's 
serious strategic and financial interests in Cyprus. 
  We recall that both the president as well as the other party 
leaders have repeatedly described the British bases as the 
remains of the British colony in Cyprus. The State Prosecution 
has opined that the British bases are not sovereign. Therefore, 
we are in a position to deactivate these bases, the remains of 
the British colony. It is time that the government and the 
House of Representatives examine legal ways to implement this. 
The decision must be made based on two basic facts: first, the 
British refusal to reimburse the Cypriot Government for the 
facilities it is offering for the operation of the bases; 
second, the use of the bases for purposes that go against the 
interests of Cyprus and its people.

  [Text] At a news conference in Nicosia today, Israeli 
Ambassador in Nicosia Shemi Tzur said Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres will soon visit Cyprus for talks on the peace 
process for the Middle East. Tzur said Cyprus is becoming more 
involved in the peace process for the Middle East. He added 
that President Glavkos Kliridhis will go to Israel on 8 July in 
conjunction with a sailing competition between Cyprus and Israel 
and he will meet the Israeli president, prime minister, and 
foreign minister. 
  The Israeli ambassador reiterated that his country 
recognizes 
only one government in Cyprus, the legal government of the 
Republic of Cyprus. He also denied reports that Israeli planes 
fly to the occupied areas and described them as exaggerated and 
wrong. He said: There has been no official Israeli activity in 
occupied Cyprus. He admitted, however, that a small travel 
agency, called (?Ricky Tours Inhetera), is cooperating with a 
Turkish agency and takes tourists to the occupied areas. Tzur 
said the Israeli Tourism Ministry has sent a letter to every 
travel agency in the country stressing that the northern part of 
Cyprus is under occupation and that the Israeli Government 
cannot offer any assistance to its nationals who visit occupied 
Cyprus.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has declared that nothing 
has been achieved yet with regard to the confidence-building 
measures [CBM] package because the United Nations is 
continuously making new demands on the Turkish Cypriot side. 
Denktas said that from the beginning, UN officials, who are 
preoccupied with petty issues, have been trying to deny the 
Turkish Cypriots their interests, as well as some of their 
requests, based on psychological reasons. 
  Denktas received Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
assistant special envoy in Cyprus, this afternoon and discussed 
the latest developments concerning the CBM package. In a 
statement after the meeting, which lasted approximately one and 
one-half hours, Denktas said that he conveyed to Feissel 
information concerning the text of the Vienna agreements, which 
the Turkish Cypriot side sent to the UN Secretariat General with 
a view to incorporating it into the 21 March document. 
  The president explained that the Turkish Cypriot side went a 
long way and made significant concessions in order to reach an 
agreement and showed great flexibility with the aim of 
concretizing the rights and freedoms promised to the Turkish 
Cypriots. Despite this, Denktas remarked, nothing has been 
achieved, and the Turkish Cypriot side is continuously being 
presented with new demands. 
  Pointing out that Greek Cypriot Administration leader 
Kliridhis' real concern is to avoid any additions to the 21 
March document, Denktas noted that the UN officials are acting 
in line with the wishes of the Greek Cypriot leader. The 
president stressed that the Turkish Cypriot side does not intend 
to succumb to all the demands of the United Nations, reiterating 
that all the negative developments stem from the fact that the 
United Nations recognizes the Greek Cypriot side as the 
legitimate government of Cyprus. Denktas added that not only is 
the United Nations making continuous demands on the Turkish 
Cypriot side, it is also unjustly holding the Turkish Cypriot 
side responsible for any problems. 
  In reply to a question, Denktas explained that Feissel will 
relay the information he received from the Turkish Cypriot side 
to New York and that a report may be submitted to the UN 
Security Council. 
  Feissel, in turn, refrained from answering any questions 
after the meeting, merely saying that he will convey the 
requests of the Turkish Cypriot side to the UN secretary 
general. Feissel remarked that the issue of access to Maras 
[Varosha] was also discussed during the meeting, which he 
described as a continuation of yesterday's talks.

  [Excerpt] Douglas Hurd, British secretary of state for 
foreign and Commonwealth affairs, has declared that the 
confidence-building measures [CBM] package submitted by the 
United Nations on the Cyprus issue is not dead. U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher also declared: I hope that the 
CBM's are not really dead. 
  Hurd and Christopher expressed their views on the subject in 
Istanbul, where they are currently attending NATO meetings, in 
response to reporters' questions regarding Greek Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias' statement that the CBM's are dead as 
far as Greece and the Greek Cypriot side are concerned. Hurd 
said that he does not share the views of Papoulias, who 
described the package as dead, adding: Efforts are continuing 
in order to reach an agreement. Comprehensive progress has been 
achieved. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Reports by Guy de Jonquieres in London and Frances Williams </F>
in Geneva: "EU To Back Ruggiero to Head the WTO"] 
  [Text] The European Union [EU] is set back Mr Renato 
Ruggiero, veteran Italian diplomat and former foreign trade 
minister to become head of the World Trade Organisation [WTO], 
which is due to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade [GATT] next year. 
  Mr Ruggiero, who is 64 and has been a director of Fiat, the 
Italian motor manufacturer, since 1991, is the first candidate 
to win official support for the post from any Gatt member. 
  Though the EU has yet formally to declare his nomination, 
Sir 
Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner -- who this week 
ruled himself out of the running-plans to canvass backing for Mr 
Ruggiero from the U.S. and Japan. 
  Sir Leon is expected to discuss the issue with Mr Mickey 
Kantor, President Bill Clinton's trade representative, and Mr 
Koji Kakizawa, the Japanese foreign minister, at next week's 
ministerial meeting in Paris of the Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development. 
  The Commission threw its weight behind Mr Ruggiero after the 
Italian government notified it yesterday that it would support 
his nomination. When the matter was discussed by officials from 
the 12 EU governments, none indicated that it intended to field 
a rival candidate. 
  Mr Ruggiero was Italy's trade minister between 1987 and 
1991, 
critical years for the Uruguay Round of world trade 
liberalisation talks. He was one of the first to espouse the 
idea of a powerful world trade organisation to replace the GATT, 
a proposal later supported by the EU. 
  Mr Ruggiero spent much of his 30 years with the Italian 
foreign service on European policy issues. He served 
successively as the European Commission's director-general of 
regional affairs, its official spokesman, and as Italy's 
permanent representative in Brussels. 
  He also represented his government in preparations for 
several world economic summits before becoming foreign trade 
minister and then co-ordinator of Fiat's international 
activities. 
  All the directors-general of the GATT to date have been 
Europeans. Mr Peter Sutherland, the present incumbent was 
previously Ireland's commissioner, in charge of European 
competition policy. 
  However, a growing number of GATT members believe the time 
has come to break with tradition. Developing countries, who 
account for most of the membership, believe they have a strong 
case for providing the first WTO head, though they have yet to 
rally behind a candidate. 
  Latin American candidates put up a respectable showing last 
year against Mr Sutherland, and the name of Mr Rubens Ricupero, 
Brazil's finance minister and a former GATT ambassador, is being 
canvassed. There are also suggestions that the job should go to 
a nominee from the Asia Pacific region. 
  Two New Zealanders have been mentioned -- Mr Philip Burdon, 
the trade minister and Mr Mike Moore, an ex-prime minister.

<F P=106> [Article by David Marsh: "Bonn Casts Doubt on Monetary </F>
Union Timetable"] 
  [Text] Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, 
yesterday appeared to cast doubt on the Maastricht timetable for 
economic and monetary union by saying that a single European 
currency might take until 2001 to realise. 
  Speaking in London, Mr Rexrodt stressed that individual 
European economies had to show "more convergence" before EMU 
[economic and monetary union] would be feasible. 
  "From the German side we are keeping the goal of a common 
currency. But we will not get excited if it takes five, six or 
seven years," he said. The Maastricht Treaty lays down 1997 and 
1999 as the earliest and latest possible dates for introduction 
of EMU. Mr Rexrodt made clear his overall commitment to 
monetary union. "We have to go that way there is no 
alternative." 
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank 
president, have both emphasised recently that maintaining 
currency stability is more important than sticking rigidly to 
the Maastricht timetable. However, Mr Rexrodt is the first 
senior member of the German economic policy establishment to say 
publicly that EMU could be delayed until the next century. He 
made the comments at a conference on investment in Germany 
organised by the German-British Chamber of Commerce. 
  Both Mr Rexrodt and Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK trade and 
industry secretary, who also spoke at the conference, underlined 
the importance of further measures to free European businesses 
from unnecessary regulation. However, the two ministers admitted 
that Britain and Germany had made little progress on setting up 
an Anglo-German panel of business experts to review EU 
legislation. The initiative was announced when the two 
ministers met in London on April 27, but Mr Rexrodt said the two 
sides were still exploring the "structure" of such a body. 
  Mr Heseltine said the delay was partly due to the 
intervening 
six weeks of campaigning for the European elections. 
  Mr Rexrodt painted a relatively optimistic picture of German 
economic recovery. The 1994 German growth rate could top the 
official target of 1.5 per cent, and expansion next year could 
be around 2 per cent, he said. 
  The two ministers showed divergence on the importance of the 
European social chapter, from which the UK won an opt-out in the 
Maastricht treaty. 
  Mr Heseltine claimed that Britain was attracting investment 
from Germany partly because German companies were trying to free 
themselves from onerous EU social legislation. "German 
companies are looking to invest here to shed themselves from the 
responsibilities of the social chapter," he said. Mr Rexrodt 
said the problem of German labour costs and social policy 
rigidities was not linked to the social chapter.

<F P=106> [David Buchan report: "Big Shake-Up of Europe's Labour </F>
Market Urged"] 
  [Text] Mulhouse -- Europe should reduce labour market 
regulation, link pay to productivity and lower barriers to cheap 
imports in order to increase competitiveness and cut chronic 
unemployment, a Franco-German study recommends. 
  A summary of the study, prepared for the German and French 
governments in the run-up to their year-long "co-ordinated" 
presidency of the European Union [EU], was released yesterday 
and coincided with the first day of a two-day Franco-German 
summit in the French border town of Mulhouse. 
  The report was issued by the economics ministry in Bonn and 
was welcomed by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, 
as showing a high degree of agreement between Germany and France 
on structural reform. 
  He described it as "a major contribution to joint 
initiatives 
to solving employment problems in Europe during the forthcoming 
German and French presidencies of the EU." 
  However, Mr Edmond Alphandery, France's economics minister, 
appeared to distance himself from the report, saying it was 
provisional and did not commit his government. 
  Germany takes the EU presidency in July for six months and 
will be followed by France, prompting the two countries to 
co-ordinate their agendas over the next year. 
  Though commissioned by both governments at their Beaune 
summit a year ago, the joint study was headed on the German side 
by Professor Johahn Eekoff, number two to Mr Rexrodt at the Bonn 
economics ministry, and, on the French side by Mr Roger Fauroux, 
a former industry minister in the socialist government. 
  In a separate communique, Mr Alphandery and Mr Theo Waigel, 
the German finance minister, hailed the prospect of low 
inflation and rising growth rates in their two countries, and 
called for measures favouring more flexibility in the labour 
market. 
  The report says the two countries have different employment 
weaknesses. Germany's drawbacks are said to include high wage 
costs, short working hours and products often too complex for 
customers' needs. French companies suffer from a heavy social 
security burden and invest too little in research. 
  However, the study says both countries suffer from 
"far-reaching labour market regulation, insufficient training 
and retraining...and lack of wage differentiation." It 
recommends: Reducing regulation, "above all in services, and 
promoting new companies and technologies, instead of subsidising 
outdated structures." 
  Basing wages policy on productivity, introducing more 
flexible working hours and "reviewing rules governing 
dismissals." 
  Regarding cheap imports from East Europe as a potential 
benefit, rather than a threat, because they "lower production 
costs" for West European industry. 
  While most of the report's conclusions would seem more 
painful for France than Germany, the study would not be without 
consequence for Germany which, it is noted, has even more 
inflexible working hour rules than France.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Commission </F>
Says U.S. Decisions Will Help China's Membership in GATT, Shares 
View That There Is No Direct Link Between Trade and Human 
Rights"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 27 May (Agence Europe) -- The spokesman 
for the European Commission commented favorably on the decisions 
made by President Clinton extending certain trade measures 
(namely the clause of most favored nation [MFN]) towards China, 
and this from a dual point of view: 

  -  Anything contributing 
to the opening and liberalization of trade with China will 
facilitate China's membership in GATT. Sir Leon Brittan said on 
several occasions that the European Union favors this membership 
if the indispensable conditions are met. Two weeks ago, GATT 
Director General Peter Sutherland, after talks in Beijing, 
indicated that a lot of technical problems remained to be solved 
and that negotiations were difficult. At present, they may be 
accelerated; 
  -  The Commission shares the view that there should be 
no direct link between the respect of human rights and trade 
sanctions. Certainly, the fundamental objective of obtaining an 
improvement in matters of democracy and human rights remains 
valid, and some too serious offenses could not be tolerated. 
But in general the link must not be automatic. 

  EUROPE adds that Mr. Sutherland recently declared that 
Taiwan's membership in the GATT has no connection with China's. 
According to him, Taiwan is a country in full expansion, its 
membership would boost the development of the world trade 
system, negotiations are being held in two separate groups, and 
Taiwan will be able to join as soon as it has obtained two 
thirds of the votes."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italy Must Push a Bit More, </F>
Christophersen Says"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, May 25 -- Price and exchange rate 
stability, achieved by reducing the inflation rate by no more 
than 2-3 percent by 1996, were among the primary objectives 
indicated by the European Commission to member states, including 
Italy, in a program document outlined here today by Commissioner 
Henning Christophersen. 
  While several countries have already reached the inflation 
rates indicated by the Commission, Italy, Spain, Portugal and 
Britain must do more to bring down inflation in their countries, 
he said. However, Christophersen added that he expected both 
Italy and Britain to be able to get their inflation rates 
significantly closer to the limits indicated by the Commission 
by next year. 
  The commissioner saw more rigid fiscal policies as the way 
to 
achieve that consolidation of national budgets called for in 
convergence programs. Here again Italy must make an additional 
effort to re-structure its tax system, finding alternative ways 
to bring in revenue -- such as the eco-tax, for example, so as 
to promote employment and not overburden the labor force, he 
said. 
  Christophersen said it was "unacceptable" that unemployment 
levels remained high even in the presence of economic recovery 
like that observed in numerous European nations. 
  Given the recovery, he said it was "illogical" that 
long-term 
interest rates continue rising and he insisted that it was 
necessary to combat this tendency through structural adjustments 
and interventions on the job market so as to the raise the 
growth rate from the present 1.6 percent to 2.5 percent in 1995. 
  Christophersen would not be drawn on the question of when 
Italy might return to the European Monetary System but defined 
as "ambitious" the Italian government's project to create one 
million jobs. Although he admitted he did not know how the 
Berlusconi government planned to achieve this goal, 
Christophersen said that ambitious governments were a good thing 
to have.

  [Text] Mulhouse (DPA) -- Germany and France will take over 
the presidency in the European Union (EU), which both countries 
will hold one after the other for almost a year as of 1 July, 
with a well coordinated work program. This was stressed by 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand 
at the conclusion of their 63d summit in Mulhouse, Alsace, on 
Tuesday [31 May]. 
  Both men emphasized that the EU must not become an "elevated 
free trade zone" because of enlargement. "This was not the 
intention of the founders. This is not our intention," 
Mitterrand said. "For me enlargement and deepening is no 
contradiction," Kohl stressed. 
  The chancellor stated that Mitterrand's announcement that he 
will invite the Eurocorps and those politically responsible in 
the participating countries for the military parade on 14 July, 
the French National Day, is a "wonderful gesture."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers </F>
by Lionel Barber and Ronald van de Krol; place and date not 
given: "Spoiler in the Euro Contest"] 
  [Text] Mr Ruud Lubbers ought to be feeling very sore. This 
week, the Dutch prime minister saw his bid to succeed Mr Jacques 
Delors as president of the European Commission blocked by a 
Franco-German steamroller in favour of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, 
prime minister of neighbouring Belgium. Once the favourite, Mr 
Lubbers finds himself scrambling to salvage his candidacy. 
  The Franco-German preference for Mr Dehaene is a clear snub; 
but Mr Lubbers appeared unruffled yesterday morning as he sipped 
black coffee in his office in the centre of the Hague. "The 
choice that has to be made now is not only a choice to be made 
by Bonn and Paris, ...it is, of course, up to all other 
countries (of the European Union) [EU]." 
  His appeal to a broader constituency remains his strongest 
card; but it poses an explicit challenge to the Franco-German 
axis which has set the direction of the Union for the past 30 
years. Unless he or Mr Dehaene withdraws, there could be an 
unseemly row at the European summit in Corfu on June 24-25, When 
EU leaders are set to decide in secret on the successor to Mr 
Delors. 
  For Mr Lubbers, this is a painful prospect. A 
consensusseeker 
schooled in the art of coalition-building in Dutch politics, he 
has spent 12 years brokering compromises inside the EU with 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois 
Mitterrand -- on issues ranging from the mindnumbing detail of 
the EU budget to German unification and the Maastricht treaty, 
which he pulled off at the end of the 1991 Dutch presidency. 
  Yet the Lubbers candidacy now transcends personalities. It 
is about the place of the Netherlands inside the Union, and the 
dilemma of smaller states struggling to preserve their influence 
ahead of the prospective entry of four new members from Austria, 
Sweden, Finland and Norway. 
  The Dutch dilemma is poignant because the Netherlands has 
never won its fair share of Euro-spoils, despite being an EU 
founder member. Unlike Belgium or Luxembourg, it has failed to 
secure Euro-institutions such as the European Parliament, the 
European Commission or the European Court of Justice, which are 
money-spinners for the local economy. Only last year, the Dutch 
bid to put the European Monetary Institute in Amsterdam was 
dashed by Mr Kohl's insistence on locating the forerunner of the 
European central bank in Frankfurt. 
  The Lubbers candidacy was supposed to redress the balance. 
Here was a prestigious post which Mr Delors has changed beyond 
recognition since he first arrived in Brussels almost 10 years 
ago. Thanks to Mr Delors, the president of the Commission is not 
just a top-flight bureaucrat, he is the public face of the 
Union. With his Christian Democrat background, and 12-year 
membership of the club of EU leaders, Mr Lubbers looked like a 
shoe-in. So what went wrong? 
  Mr Lubbers concedes he may have alienated the French and the 
Germans earlier this year by refusing to commit himself to 
entering the race. He was worried about distracting public 
attention from last month,s Dutch general election at a time 
when Mr Elco Brinkman, his hand-picked successor, was struggling 
to take over his mantle. He had also pledged to Queen Beatrix to 
serve out his term as prime minister, which precluded a public 
campaign for the Brussels post of the kind waged by Sir Leon 
Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator. Sir Leon and Mr Peter 
Sutherland, former head of Gatt, are long-shot contenders. 
  In retrospect Mr Lubbers's reticence looks like 
miscalculation. The French seized on Mr Dehaene, a 
French-speaker on the left of the Christian Democrat party, who 
had impressed during last year's Belgian presidency of the EU. 
Mr Kohl, who favoured initially Mr Wilfried Martens, a former 
Belgian premier, fell into line. 
  Mr Martens did not command the support of his own 
government, 
so "Kohl feared that he was empty-handed," said Mr Lubbers, 
adding mischievously that the rotund Mr Dehaene had the goesting 
(appetite) for the top job. 
  That may not be the whole story. Mr Lubbers and Mr Kohl have 
never been close. Nor did the German chancellor appreciate the 
Dutchman's call for clarity about the German-Polish border 
during German unification, challenging Mr Kohl's preference for 
leaving the question open in order to placate the German right 
ahead of the 1990 general election. So is he too 
independent-minded for Mr Kohl? The Dutch prime minister 
paused: "Perhaps." 
  There is no question that Mr Lubbers has his own views on 
the 
future of Europe. He is keen on a common European defence 
evolving under the umbrella of the NATO alliance, and is 
frustrated with the UK government for dragging its feet. He 
also supports European monetary union, mainly because the Dutch 
are certain to be in the vanguard along with the Germans. 
  Yet he is sympathetic to British warnings about the risks of 
integration moving too far ahead of European public opinion. 
Even in his own country, he feels that enthusiasm for Europe is 
diminishing. Hence the need for Europe's leaders to restore a 
sense of mission. He offered three slogans: 
  1. Efficiency. Mr Lubbers, who comes from a line of 
Rotterdam industrialists, wants tighter controls on the ECU70bn 
annual EU budget and a bigger role for the Court of Auditors, 
the spending watchdog. "People must have the feeling that 
resources are well spent." 
  2. Democracy. He wants more transparency in 
decision-making. He favours a bigger role for the European 
Parliament in shaping legislation, more public debates with the 
Commission, and more involvement by national parliaments in 
areas of inter-governmental co-operation under the second and 
third pillars of the Maastricht treaty, such as foreign policy, 
security and justice matters. 
  3. Credibility. He is worried about the EU stretching its 
ambitions. He cautions against a "Big Bang" conference to 
review Maastricht in 1996 which could introduce more qualified 
majority voting in an expanded Union. He welcomes the 
"inevitable" EU membership of the central European countries 
such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic; but he warns 
against arousing unrealistic expectations about the timing of 
entry. 
  Yet Mr Lubbers wants the EU to work. With out criticising 
the call this week by Mr John Major, UK prime minister, for a 
multi-speed Europe, he said the principle of opting out should 
apply only to the second and third pillars. On EMU [European 
Monetary Union], he conceded that some countries might move 
faster than others, "but there must be a limited time 
difference. We should not accept too easily all sorts of 
exceptions and differences in speeds." 
  On the other hand, Mr Lubbers has little sympathy for French 
calls for a club of "founder members" led by France, Germany, 
the Benelux and Italy -- an idea floated again this week by Mr 
Alain Lamassoure, France's minister for European affairs. 
  "I find this fascinating. Why? Because he suggests that the 
old Six should give a new example of what to do. But he 
(Lamassoure) writes the article on the very same day as two of 
them, France and Germany, come out of the preparations for the 
next (European) Council not as Six but as Two. Italy and the 
Netherlands are included in his architecture, but are excluded 
from consensus-seeking." 
  There is a firmness in tone which suggests that Mr Lubbers 
is 
loath to let a Franco-German diktat push him out of the race. 
So is he ready to take his candidacy "down to the wire" at 
Corfu? "Yes," came the unequivocal response.

<F P=106> [Report signed MTH: "Delors' Succession: Tindemans Comes </F>
Out in Favor of Dehaene"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 2 Jun (ANP) -- On Wednesday [1 June], Leo 
Tindemans of the CVP [Flemish Christian People's Party], who is 
chairman of the Christian Democrats in the European Parliament 
(EP), announced on a Netherlands commercial television station 
that he was in favor of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene 
succeeding Jacques Delors as president of the European 
Commission (EC). 
  The statements by Tindemans were greeted with astonishment 
by 
both his entourage and by Dutch members of his political group. 
The former Belgian prime minister will announce his choice to 
the new group that is elected as soon as it takes up its duties 
after the European elections next 9 and 12 June. The EPP 
[Group of the European People's Party] chairman Wilfried Martens 
said he was "embarrassed" by the statement made by Tindemans, 
for there had been no consultation with him, nor any decision 
within the party on a potential candidate to succeed Delors. 
  Up to now, the only candidate declared by the PPE group is 
former Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, who has 
officially submitted his candidacy to succeed Delors, something 
which the Belgian prime minister has not done. 
  "I would not attach too much importance to these 
statements," 
Martens affirmed. 
  According to him, if the PPE decides to present a single 
candidate for the post of EC president, it will make its 
decision at the summit meeting of the heads of government and 
chairmen of Christian Democratic parties to be held in Brussels 
on 22 June.

<F P=106> [Article by Adrian Hamilton: "Why Union Must Take Its Lead </F>
From Germany"] 
  [Text] Of all the mis-conceptions British politicians hold 
about Europe, the most pervasive and ill-judged is the belief 
that there is a plot by Germany and France to drive the 
continent ever onwards towards a federal superstate, with or 
without all its partners. 
  There is no such plot. What there is, is a community of 
individual countries disillusioned by recession, unnerved by the 
Maastricht debate but badly in need of some renewed momentum to 
meet the challenges of enlargement and unemployment. Contrary 
to the British view, enlargement of Europe has always led to 
greater integration: this is no exception. 
  The question is: who is going to make the running? The 
Franco-German axis indeed remains central, if only because 
without it the European Union would fall apart. That is why 
Chancellor Kohl, who will hold the presidency of Europe from 
July, and President Mitterrand, who follows him in January, made 
so much of their meeting in Mulhouse last week. 
  But the Paris-Bonn link is showing its age. France and 
Germany may talk of longterm plans: in terms of practical 
proposals and real weight it is through Kohl and Germany, 
reunited by history but sobered by the experience, that European 
impetus has to come. An enlarged Europe swings north and east. 
Europe in recovery goes Germany's way. 
  Kohl believes he can win the October election for 
Chancellor. 
Mitterrand knows he is going next spring and will almost be 
certainly replaced by a conservative nearer to German views. 
  The good news for Europhiles is that a resurgent Germany is 
also a Germany anxious to keep within Europe rather than reach 
out for the new opportunities in the east on its own. `Germany,' 
says Dr. Hans-Friedrich von Ploetz, director-general of the 
federal Foreign Office, `is in a unique situation. All her 
neighbours want to work with her. There is no coalition against 
Germany. We want to make this situation permanent.' 
  Therein lies a century of history and generations of 
insecurity. Therein also lies Germany's profound commitment to 
the union. Keeping Germany as part of a dynamic and expanding 
European Union is the way of making security permanent. It may 
be also the only way of keeping the far right under check. 
Hence an obsession that Europe must create a police force and 
common actions to control immigration and racism. 
  The good news for the British, at least for the 
Conservatives, is that much of what Germany wants to do is far 
from inimical to British economic thinking, even if Kohl is dead 
against the idea of leaving a Europe as an `elevated free trade 
area.' Nearly two years of recession and four years of 
reunification have convinced German government and business that 
the road to recovery is paved with flexible labour arrangements 
and lower costs. 
  Equally, there is an almost savage mood against Brussels and 
over-regulation. Reunification has reconfirmed the importance 
of regional devolution. A Europe run by Germany would be a 
Europe of regions, in which the powers of Brussels would be 
strictly circumscribed and the functions of the Council and 
Parliament clearly defined. 
  This owes more to German domestic pressures than 
philosphical 
belief. The past few years have turned the German public 
inwards. Reunification has given it a greater sense of national 
destiny but also a greater consciousness of cost. This has made 
Germany accept that early membership by the Czech republic, 
Hungary and Poland will have to be put off until their economies 
are more compatible. Cost has also made Bonn reluctant to 
sanction high investment in infrastructure, preferring a more 
competitive environment as the means to new jobs. 
  That in many ways puts it on a divergent course to France, 
which still believes in centralisation, federalism and 
investment as the way out of recession. France, which needs 
Europe to give it a central position, would prefer to push ahead 
with an inner core. Germany, which likes to see allies all the 
way to more distant horizons, does not. 
  The great question remains the single currency. The German 
public doesn't want it, its independent central bank is solidly 
opposed, yet Chancellor Kohl persists. The date can be put off, 
he suggests, but the aim must be pursued. 
  It is a commitment that will not necessarily outlast Kohl 
should he lose in October. On Europe, uniquely for so careful a 
politician, he is way ahead of his own public opinion. But if 
Kohl goes and Germany turns inward, Europe has problems. 
  There is no alternative to German leadership at this moment, 
and not just because it has the presidency from July. France, 
following it in the EU presidency, has a domestic presidential 
election in the middle of its European term. Spain, Italy and 
Britain are all weighed down by internal political crises. 
Enlargement is far from a foregone conclusion. 
  The advantage of Germany's presidency is that it has at 
least 
had stable political leadership of its own for the past 
halfcentury. It will take on structural reform of the Community 
and will get decisions moving again. The disadvantage is that, 
in seeking a vision of Europe after so long below the parapet, 
Germany remains confined to its own experience -- regionalised, 
industrialised, self-sufficient and provincial. 
  That leaves much for the British to play for. The whole area 
of security and foreign policy is ill-defined and barely 
nascent. The reformation of the Union structures has still to 
be approached, let alone decided. Monetary Union is now not due 
for consideration until 1997 at the earliest. But, to do this, 
Britain has now to come to terms with German thinking. It's not 
a case of joining them or being left out. That has always been 
one of the more foolish arguments of Euro-enthusiasts. It's 
simply a matter of being in there. For if the German presidency 
goes sour, we are all in trouble.

<F P=106> [David Marsh report: "Voters Divided on EU's Important </F>
Issues"] 
  [Text] Europeans generally favour enlarging the EU 
[European Union] northwards and eastwards, but are deeply split 
over the desirability of deepening integration as laid down by 
the Maastricht treaty, according to an opinion poll commissioned 
by the FINANCIAL TIMES. 
  The poll, carried out for the FT and seven European 
newspapers, reveals great diversity among the 12 EU member 
states on attitudes towards the European parliament and the 
future of European cooperation. 
  The detailed findings are as follows: 
  Only 31 per cent of British people surveyed said they wanted 
a more integrated Europe, compared with 61 per cent favouring a 
looser form of European cooperation. Similar votes were seen in 
eastern Germany, Denmark and western Germany, where scores were 
33 per cent to 62 cent, 26 per cent to 61 per cent and 37 per 
cent to 58 per cent against Maastricht-style integration 
respectively. By contrast, between 64 and 72 per cent of 
respondents in Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Belgium favoured 
more integration. 
  Residents of Ireland and the UK appear to believe most 
strongly that a single currency in at least three EU states will 
be established by the end of the century, with 63 per cent and 
64 per cent respectively saying they believed this was either 
"very likely" or "fairly likely." Greatest scepticism in this 
field came from the "hard currency" countries, with 61 per cent 
of east and west Germans and 52 per cent of Dutch respondents 
holding the view that this was unlikely. 
  Asked about responses to the conflict in former Yugoslavia, 
38 per cent of respondents throughout the EU, spread fairly 
evenly among the 12, argued in favour of continued diplomatic 
efforts to end the fighting. Only 16 per cent and 17 per cent 
respectively called for combat troops or air strikes to bring 
peace. 
  Regarding the European elections, 72 per cent of all 
respondents said they were "absolutely certain" to vote, while 7 
per cent described their turnout as "very likely," 8 per cent as 
"fairly likely" and 6 per cent as "not very likely." 
  Only 49 per cent of British said they were "absolutely 
certain" to vote, compared with 93 per cent in Greece, 89 per 
cent in Belgium and 83 per cent in Luxembourg (in all three 
countries, voting is compulsory). By contrast, 76 per cent of 
respondents in western Germany and 67 per cent of those in 
eastern Germany said they were certain to vote. 
  Of those "absolutely certain" to vote, 56 per cent of the 
Irish, 55 per cent of Portuguese and 53 per cent of east Germans 
said they would do so to support their countries' governments. 
Only 35 per cent of Britons and Danes and 15 per cent of 
Belgians gave this as a reason. 
  A protest vote seems particularly likely in the UK and 
Spain, 
where 25 per cent and 23 per cent of respondents respectively 
said they would vote to voice opposition to their governments. 
  Denmark recorded the highest score -- 35 per cent -- of 
respondents saying they were not certain to vote because they 
"do not understand the (European) issues." Others who admitted 
failure to understand European affairs were the British (32 per 
cent) and Italians (29 per cent). 
  On enlargement, the proposed extension of the EU on January 
1 
1995 to Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria is given particular 
support by west Germans (87 per cent), east Germans (88 per 
cent), and Italians (86 per cent). Even those most lukewarm on 
enlargement to the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] 
countries -- the Spanish and Portuguese -- are 70 per cent and 
72 per cent in favour. 
  There is more divergence over enlarging the EU to former 
Communist countries. The largest scores in favour of bringing 
in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia came from 
Italy (69 per cent) eastern Germany (60 per cent) Belgium, The 
Netherlands and Spain (56 per cent each). The lowest scores 
were seen in western Germany and Portugal (47 per cent), 
Luxembourg and Britain (45 per cent) and Denmark (33 per cent). 
  British and Danish respondents stood out as thinking the 
European Parliament has too much power, with 38 per cent and 37 
per cent of respondents respectively holding this view. By 
contrast, 60 per cent of east Germans, 55 per cent of west 
Germans and Italians, and 54 per cent of Greek and French 
respondents said parliament has too little power -- a view held 
by 46 per cent of respondents throughout the EU. 
  Britons and Danes also believe the European Commission is 
too 
powerful, with 58 per cent and 51 per cent of respondents taking 
this line. 
  The main defenders of the European Commission seem to be the 
east Germans, Spanish, Italians and Belgians -- between 40 per 
cent and 43 per cent of these respondents say the Commission has 
too little power.

will be points in the open ocean. 
  This step is a positive demonstration of the developing

Administration: "Britain Gives Further 5 Million Pounds To Help 
Rwandan Refugees"] 
  [Text] Britain is to give 5 million pounds to provide 
further support for refugees from the conflict in Rwanda, 
Baroness Chalker, Minister for Overseas Development, announced 
today. 
  This will go towards: 

  -  Expanding support for 
non-governmental organisations working in the area to provide 
water, food and health services; 
  -  Helping to protect the 
environment in the ecologically fragile Kagera region of 
Tanzania, including research into alternative fuels to prevent 
deforestation; 
  -  Assisting Uganda with the disposal of 
corpses; 
  -  Improving the management of the aid operation, 
including the continuation of an airbridge at Mwanza in 
north-west Tanzania to ferry in supplies and the exploration of 
the possible alternative uses of road, rail or water. 

  This brings the amount given to help Rwandan refugees to 
over 
11 million pounds since April, including the UK share of EC aid.

<F P=106> [Article by Kevin Brown: "PM Hardens Attack on European </F>
Integration"] 
  [Text] Mr John Major hardened the tone of his attacks on 
European integration last night as an opinion poll suggested the 
Conservatives face disaster in the elections on Thursday [9 
June]. 
  A Gallup poll in today's DAILY TELEGRAPH puts the 
Conservatives in third place behind the Liberal Democrats and 
more than 30 percentage points behind Labour. 
  It estimates support for the Conservatives at just 21 per 
cent, down 3.5 percentage points since early May, compared with 
21.5 per cent for the Liberal Democrats (down 3.5 points), and 
54 per cent for Labour (up 9.5 points). 
  The gap between the Conservatives and Labour is the biggest 
since the height of the poll tax debacle in 1989, when it stood 
at about 30 percentage points. 
  Labour officials said part of the increase in support was 
probably due to public sympathy following the death of Mr John 
Smith, and increased media coverage caused by the contest to 
succeed him. 
  However, the poll suggests that Labour is on course for a 
landslide victory in the European elections while the 
Conservatives could be reduced to a handful of seats. 
  The only consolation for the Conservatives is that the poll 
was carried out between May 25 and May 30 -- before the prime 
minister launched an attack on European Union [EU] integration 
at a rally in Ellesmere Port on Tuesday. Conservative 
strategists believe his concept of a multi-speed Europe, in 
which member states progress at different rates offers the best 
hope of persuading Tory supporters to vote. 
  Senior officials said last night's speech was intended to 
shore up the Conservatives' image as the strongest defender of 
British rights in the EU. In his most forthright comments of 
the campaign, Mr Major said he was unrepentant about his 
criticisms of the EU, and insisted "Europe has gone wrong in 
recent years." 
  He pledged to campaign for an open Europe in which the 
weight 
of bureaucracy and regulation was dramatically reduced, and 
which was not "the remote preserve of an elite circle of 
politicians and bureaucrats." 
  Mr Major's return to the Eurosceptic theme will be welcomed 
by Conservative right-wingers, who believe they have won the 
party's internal battle about its approach to the Union. 
  However, it was seized on by the opposition as further 
evidence of the government's willingness to draft policy to 
paper over Conservative splits rather than in the national 
interest. 
  Mr Jack Straw, Labours European elections campaign manager, 
said the prime minister was "once again selling Britain short in 
Europe."

  [Text] Europe affects us directly and crucially. That must 
be the starting point. Our security and prosperity depend on 
what happens on our own continent. Withdrawal from its leading 
institution -- the European Union [EU] -- is the stuff of an 
entertaining polemic, but unreal. The real question, and a 
vital one for Conservatives, is how to achieve the kind of 
Europe we can feel at ease with. We want it to deliver tangible 
benefits for the citizen, while respecting the identity and 
legitimacy of the nation state. Few people in Britain would 
dissent from that. 
  On June 9 there is a choice between two different ideas of 
Europe. The Conservative Party believes in closer European 
cooperation. We seek it in order to deliver specific benefits 
which are beyond the reach of individual nation states. Unlike 
our opponents, we believe that the EU already has the 
competences it needs. We are saying that the areas of policy 
which go to the heart of the nation state -- like taxes, the 
currency, immigration, and foreign policy -- must remain 
governed by the national veto. We are clear that Europe is 
strengthened by bringing the nation states to work together 
rather than by fusing them into a federal European state. 
  We have had a rough argument inside the Conservative Party 
over Maastricht. We differed on whether the Treaty, as signed 
by Britain with the opt-outs, was a help or a hindrance to our 
idea of Europe. That argument is in the past. I have found in 
this campaign, from Aberdeen to Surrey, that when we discuss the 
future, the overwhelming majority of Conservatives come 
together. For months I have been hopefully predicting this -- 
so it is a relief to find it coming true! 
  The Labour and Liberal vision of Europe is different. They 
see no objection in principle to further transfers of power to 
the centre. Their equivocation over the national veto testifies 
to that. The Liberals even reject the Maastricht idea of 
flexible cooperation between governments outside the scope of 
the European Commission and the European Court of Justice. 
  The divide over economic policy is also clear. Conservatives 
are working for budgetary discipline, deregulation, labour 
market flexibility and the lightening of costs on business. 
Labour and Liberals are committed to a Social Chapter whose 
only certain effect would be to destroy British jobs, along with 
a raft of extra spending on proposals which would punish 
Europe's taxpayers. The arguments here are familiar from our 
own domestic politics -- a choice between jobs and enterprise on 
the one hand and socialism on the other. That is what we mean 
by Europe -- Right or Left? 
  One of the odd things about politics is the way an argument 
suddenly reaches a wide audience some time after it is first 
stated. It is good news that the Prime Minister regained the 
initiative for Conservatives with his speech last Tuesday [31 
May] about a multi-track Europe. It is a thought which he and 
others of us have expounded before. It was a main theme of my 
speech at the Scottish Party conference on May 11. It is a 
statement of reality. 
  Britain has troops in Bosnia alongside the French, Spaniards 
Dutch and some, but not all, other Europeans. We belong to the 
Western European Union -- others don't. Britain is among the 
pioneers of a common European foreign policy based on unanimity 
and cooperation between governments. Where we can agree, it 
makes sense to act together. We do not belong to the Schengen 
arrangement on frontiers. We do not belong to the Exchange Rate 
Mechanism. We are not committed to a single bank or a single 
currency. But we are not alone in any of these positions. This 
flexibility is already part of the Europe of nations working 
together -- and will be even more so as the European Union 
slowly expands to the East. 
  The next question is: Does the European Parliament matter 
enough to vote for? The answer is yes. The Parliament has 
important powers to amend EC laws, along with a new blocking 
power in certain areas. It has new powers to scrutinise EC 
spending, to deal with fraud, to call the European Commission to 
account, and to approve its appointment. It must also give its 
assent to the admission of new members. We need it to work with 
us for the next five years -- not against us, as it does now 
with its Left-wing majority. 
  That means that we need more Conservative MEPs [member of 
European Parliament] in Strasbourg. To increase the influence 
of the Centre-Right, they are allied -- not joined -- to the 
Parliamentary group of the European Peoples Party with which we 
see eye-to-eye on such issues as free enterprise, budgetary 
restraint, law and order, and the Atlantic alliance. The 
arrangement makes good practical sense. But Conservative MEPs 
are standing exclusively on our British Conservative manifesto 
which explicitly rejects the idea of a federal European state. 
  There are now unmistakable signs of a shift away from the 
centralising consensus which has hitherto underpinned the 
Community. This change of climate is becoming apparent across 
Europe. 
  There are several reasons. The influence of the Commission 
looks set to wane as Jacques Delors steps down and the member 
states reclaim the political initiative. In France and Germany 
we are seeing a more assertive mood from national politicians in 
response to real public concern about Europe. Chancellor Kohl 
explains why it is a mistake to follow the American analogy and 
talk of a United States of Europe. The new Italian government 
brings a different international pedigree to its attitude to 
Europe. 
  We are already seeing some real change in the way the 
European Union works. The number of legislative proposals has 
been more than halved -- between 1991 and 1993. The Commission 
estimates that 25 per cent of all existing law can now be 
simplified or scrapped. Meanwhile, Europe's economic script is 
being rewritten around our theme of deregulation and 
competitiveness, with Germany eager to claim co-authorship. 
  So we have everything to gain by arguing from centre-stage. 
There is plenty of tough argument ahead. The Commission is 
still inserting itself into too many of the nooks and crannies. 
The old-fashioned notion that the good European is one who 
believes in the constant transfer of power to the centre in 
Brussels still holds sway in some political establishments -- as 
it does with the Liberal Democrat and Labour Parties here. But 
we should not underestimate our influence. We did not win the 
battles for the Single Market, budgetary discipline, 
subsidiarity, intergovernmental co-operation and EU enlargement 
by sulking on the sidelines. 
  For the next intergovernmental conference in 1996 we need to 
work out a coherent framework for an enlarged union -- one which 
paves the way for a flexible, multi-speed Europe formed around a 
solid core of common policies and rules. This is the only model 
which will enable us to build the new democracies of Central and 
East Europe into our enterprise. 
  If Conservatives vote Liberal Democrat or abstain on 
Thursday. they may find themselves represented at Strasbourg by 
someone working hard for the kind of Europe they most dislike. 
Little has ever been achieved for Britain by staying at home. 
If, as Conservatives and as a country, we take a robust, 
positive and distinctive stand on June 9, that will be an 
important advance towards the kind of Europe we want.

<F P=106> [Colin Brown report: "Gummer Spikes PM's Attempt To Unite </F>
Party"] 
  [Text] John Major's attempt to unite the Conservative 
Party began to come apart yesterday when John Gummer distanced 
himself from the Prime Minister's vision of a multi-speed Europe. 
  The Secretary of State for Environment, a committed 
pro-European, said it did not put Britain in the slow lane. He 
said: "What he (John Major) is absolutely clear (about) is that 
Britain is not going to be at a slower speed than the rest of 
Europe. That would be quite unacceptable. We are at the heart 
of Europe. We have no intention of being at a slower speed than 
the rest." But the Europhobes, including Lord Tebbit, who 
hailed the Prime Minister's words as a turning point, believe he 
has signalled that Britain will not be carried along by other 
member states on a track towards single currency and deeper 
union. The confusion in the Tory camp is unlikely to influence 
the result. 
  Labour strategists used the results of a telephone poll of 
1,000 voters to play down expectations. It gave Labour 43 per 
cent, the Tories 30 per cent and the Liberal Democrats 21 per 
cent. While admitting the survey should be treated with 
caution, Labour estimates that could translate into 50 to 55 
seats for Labour, 20 for the Tories and a handful for the 
Liberal Democrats. 
  The Tory leadership has been planning on the assumption of a 
low turn-out in Thursday's [9 June] poll and has directed its 
"Euro-sceptic" message at its bedrock. It believes it has 
touched a chord with its campaign over the alleged threat to the 
national veto and jobs posed by the Social Chapter. In the 
run-up to polling day the Tory party yesterday continued to 
hammer away at that theme. Mr Major will reinforce that message 
today in his final rally in London. 
  Sir Norman Fowler, the chairman of the party, denied running 
a negative Euro-sceptic campaign. He said: "Right up to polling 
day we are going to keep on pushing home our positive message on 
the key European issues. We are going to keep on pointing out 
the contrast between our determination to stand up for British 
interests and Labour and Liberal willingness to see Britain 
out-voted and walked over." That is the kind of "positive" 
message that has dismayed Europhile Tory MPs. 
  Mr Major has made it clear he will not stand down, however 
bad the results are when they are declared next Monday. But 
back- benchers say Mr Major will be under increased pressure to 
go by the autumn, if a Labour Party under Tony Blair builds on 
its success in the European polls and by-elections on Thursday. 
The Tory high command is prepared to write-off defeats this 
week as a protest vote. But Europhile Tories said it would be a 
disaster if the Tories were left with 15 seats -- a third of the 
seats held before the 1989 election. 
  "It is not the Europhiles who will cause trouble. If Labour 
gets 44 per cent of the vote and we get less than we did last 
time (34 per cent) it will be all those people who suddenly 
realise their seats have gone who will start to get twitchy," 
said one leading pro-Europe MP. 
  Tory Europhiles say Mr Major's leadership can no longer be 
trusted on Europe, as a result of the negative campaign that he 
has led. They are in a minority, but if mainstream Tories fear 
defeat under Mr Major, panic could lead to a clamour for a 
change of leader in the autumn. 
  Michael Heseltine's support is hardening in response to the 
threat of Labour under Mr Blair. One ardent pro-European MP 
said: "I would have voted for Kenneth Clarke, but colleagues are 
saying Heseltine is the one person who can eat Blair alive." 
  They believe the Tory campaign, centred on the threat to the 
national veto, has been used for short-term advantage, without 
taking account of the long-term damage it might cause. 
  "The Prime Minister has pushed some of the right buttons. He 
has pleased the Euro-hostile Tories but they are not the ones 
who are going to go out and fight for a result on Thursday. He 
has very severely demoralised the people who have to go out 
among our traditional supporters." 
  Senior Tory MPs who criticise the campaign as too negative 
point out that the formula of a multi-speed Europe, on which Mr 
Major has fought the election, never appeared in the Tory 
European manifesto. They said it was produced to appease 
Europhobes with private assurances to some leading pro-European 
Tories that a more positive approach would be taken after the 
election.

<F P=106> [Article by Philip Webster and Jill Sherman: "Major Attacks </F>
Deadly Sins of Europe"] 
  [Text] John Major last night issued an impassioned plea to 
Conservative voters to turn out for tomorrow's European 
elections as he used the final hours of campaigning to repeat 
his demand for a multi-speed Community. 
  The Prime Minister gave several stark warnings that the 
European Union would fall apart unless it became more flexible 
and he cautioned stay-at-home Tory voters that they could be 
letting in socialists who wanted a centralised federal state. 
  Success for Labour or the Liberal Democrats would be a 
ticket 
to disaster, he said, since the opposition parties supported the 
"seven deadly sins" of Europe. They wanted more powers to be 
transferred from Britain to Brussels, the social chapter, a 
single currency, taxes to be levelled up, EU [European Union] 
spending raised the veto weakened and Britain's rebate to be 
renegotiated. 
  "Don't stay at home and let others choose the destiny of the 
continent," Mr Major told a rally in London. "Don't stay at home 
and complain when you hear, as you inevitably would, that a 
socialist majority at Strasbourg is calling for more spending, 
more tax, more interference by Brussels in the nooks and 
crannies of your lives." 
  Mr Major's appeal came as an ICM [International 
Communications and Marketing Research] opinion poll for the 
DAILY EXPRESS suggested the Tories could win between 15 and 20 
seats -- more than some recent polls have suggested. The survey 
put Labour on 45 per cent, the Conservatives on 27 and the 
Liberal Democrats 22 per cent. 
  Yesterday Mr Major repeatedly returned to the multitrack 
theme, which Conservative strategists believe may pay dividends, 
brushing aside suggestions that the Cabinet was split over his 
approach. 
  By the turn of the century, the Union could have 20 members, 
he said: "It is a different sort of Community, we have to deal 
with it in a different way. It is bound to be more flexible. If 
it is not more flexible it will break." Later he told LBC that 
people were uneasy at the direction they believed Europe had 
been going, that it was too prescriptive and centralised and had 
taken too many powers from Westminster. It was to combat that 
feeling that he was pressing for a multi-speed Europe. 
  Mr Major's decision to keep playing the multi-speed card, in 
spite of reservations among Cabinet ministers such as John 
Gummer, reflects the support Tory canvassers are detecting for 
it among traditional core voters. Even among Conservative MPs 
not known as strong supporters of the Prime Minister, there is a 
view that he has struck a chord and there is praise, too, for 
the energetic campaign he has fought in sharp contrast to 
Margaret Thatcher's low-key efforts five years ago. 
  Yesterday, Mr Major seized on an international jobs study by 
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as 
evidence that Britain's approach to unemployment was being 
adopted by other countries. But the report sparked an angry row 
as Labour, too, claimed it vindicated the party's policies. 
  The study sets out the case for a compromise between an 
over-regulated and a deregulated jobs market, pointing to the 
dangers of both. Although it leans towards Conservative policy, 
it does not come out against a minimum wage. It does, however, 
call for more flexible working hours, wage and labour costs to 
reflect local conditions and skills. It also spells out the 
need for a highly skilled workforce. 
  Mr Major and Kenneth Clarke insisted yesterday that the 
report was an outright endorsement of their campaign to cut red 
tape and Brussels interference. Mr Major said its 
recommendations had been the core of every Conservative 
manifesto of his political career, while the Chancellor said: 
"It suggests that not only was Britain right to get out of the 
social chapter, but that other countries should get out of it 
too." 
  But Labour's John Prescott accused the Conservatives of 
twisting the word "flexibility" to mean low pay, poor conditions 
and fewer rights. The report had, he said, endorsed Labour 
proposals to impose a training levy on firms, to link education 
to skills training and to create new jobs through improved 
productivity, innovation and technology. 
  Margaret Beckett, Labour's acting leader, meanwhile alleged 
that the Government was so divided over Europe that it could not 
govern effectively. "Mr Major has been trying to play to his 
Eurosceptics to try to placate them, to keep the party 
together," she said. ``There is no substantive rift over Europe 
in the Labour Party. We all agree that the way to do it is to 
put Britain at the top of the heap in Europe while Mr Major 
wants us in the bicycle lane. 
  ``One of the things we have to do is to maintain Britain's 
influence in Europe. Part of the Governments incompetence in 
Europe is that they are depriving Britain of a voice and of 
influence.'' 
  While Mr Major insisted yesterday that the European 
elections 
were not a referendum on his domestic performance, Paddy Ashdown 
again urged voters to use the polls to deliver their verdict on 
a Tory campaign that had broken promises and betrayed hopes. 
  The Liberal Democrat leader told a rally in Plymouth: "The 
Conservatives persuaded people to vote for lies once. I believe 
most people in this country are not prepared to let the 
Conservatives make mugs of them twice. Every Conservative vote 
will be a vote to say that you don't mind broken promises about 
taxation ... to say that honesty doesn't matter. Every 
Conservative vote will be a vote to say to the Government: 
`You're doing a great job, please carry on.'"

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Major Loses Hold of Middle Ground"] </F>
  [Text] This is the week when Conservative Party woes will 
again take centre stage. John Smith's death briefly shifted 
attention away from the Government's unpopularity. But that 
tragedy has now ceased to be a distraction. John Major awaits a 
defeat at the polls on Thursday at least as bad as, and probably 
worse than, the local election debacle a month ago. 
  The Prime Minister may be confident that, having weathered 
that result, he will also survive humiliation in the European 
elections. He can take credit for the public unity his party has 
recently strained to demonstrate. The Tory party has proved 
that it can sing from the same hymn sheet when the need is 
desperate. Mr Major may also feel less threatened by Michael 
Heseltine, his most menacing potential usurper. His 
challenger's history of coronary heart disease has become a 
political liability. 
  Yet these comforts are small beside the problems faced by 
the 
Conservatives. The odds on their retaining control of 10 
Downing Street have lengthened considerably even since the local 
elections. In the process of holding his party together, Mr 
Major has adopted an increasingly right-wing agenda and left the 
middle ground of politics vulnerable to take-over by other 
parties. 
  Mr Smith had begun to attract more centrist voters. Tony 
Blair, his likely successor, is proving even more seductive. 
His speech in Eastleigh last week declared Labour "the party of 
one nation." It was designed unashamedly to lure those Tories 
who long for a revival of values associated with Disraeli, 
Macleod and Heath. 
  If Mr Major is not alarmed by Mr Blair, then he should be by 
his own failure to regain some of the political high ground as 
the economy slowly improves. The Tories have felt quietly 
confident that a return to prosperity would reverse the opinion 
polls by the time of the next election. Yet a study published 
last week by the analysts Kleinwort Benson tells a different 
story. Using econometric models, it finds that the pound's 
withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday 
in September 1992 cost the Government 16 points in popular 
support which it has failed to regain. 
  "Despite the recession, before September 1992, the 
Conservatives had a clear lead over Labour," the study finds. 
"But after Black Wednesday the two parties swapped places; ever 
since then Labour have been as much ahead of the Conservatives 
as they were previously behind." In other words, the sterling 
crisis triggered a political collapse that has proved far more 
difficult to repair than was ever expected at the time. 
  Mr Major faces a heavy responsibility: to hold his party 
together, while reclaiming the affections of ordinary, 
middle-of- the-road voters who trusted his common sense style in 
1992. Before Tory critics bay for his blood again when the 
election results are announced they should be aware how enormous 
that task is. They would be wise to avoid making their leader's 
life any harder than it is already bound to be.

  [Text] Hamburg -- According to Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union), the states in Central and 
East Europe might become NATO members by the year 2000. He is 
convinced that the alliance will be enlarged by that time, even 
though not all countries may be accepted at the same time, Ruehe 
stated today on the occasion of the renaming of the General 
Schwarzkopf Barracks in Hamburg as Lieutenant General Count von 
Baudissin Barracks. Ruehe unveiled the new nameplate in front 
of the new Bundeswehr staff college, which is named after the 
father of the "inner leadership" of the Bundeswehr and peace 
researcher Wolf Count von Baudissin. Baudissin died in Hamburg a 
year ago. 
  Russia, however, will be integrated neither in the European 
Union nor in NATO, but must be included in a partnership that 
corresponds to its size, responsibility, and significance, Ruehe 
pointed out. The integration of the neighboring countries in the 
East must be accompanied by intensified cooperation and a 
dialogue with Russia on nuclear security and the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. "However, it is clear that 
Russia will not have a right of veto concerning the enlargement 
of the alliance. It is also clear that there is no hierarchy 
among the European institutions." Otherwise, the foundations of 
security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic region would fall 
apart. 
  Hamburg Mayor Hennig Voscherau (Social Democratic Party of 
Germany) stressed that the new tasks of the Bundeswehr and the 
acceptance of more responsibility must take place on the basis 
of a political consensus in Germany. "The current insecurity 
has a negative impact on the motivation of the soldiers and 
officers." According to Ruehe, the peacetime strength of the 
Bundeswehr should include 340,000 soldiers on a long-term basis.

  [Text] Augsburg (DPA) -- Bundeswehr Inspector General 
Klaus Naumann has come out in favor of not forgetting Russia's 
contribution on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the end 
of World War II next year. In an interview with AUGSBURGER 
ALLGEMEINE (Tuesday [7 June] edition), Naumann said that a 
celebration with Russia "is not my decision." But one "should 
not forget the contribution and the sacrifices made by Russia to 
destroy fascism and to end the war, even though Moscow's goal 
was the establishment of another dictatorship." 
  Concerning accusations of antisemitic and xenophobic 
statements by drunk Guard Battalion soldiers, as well as the 
arrest of a noncommissioned officer for being the head of a 
defense sports group, Naumann said that he does not observe any 
intensified influx of right-wing extremists in the Bundeswehr. 
Last year 53 such cases were reported, in which 63 soldiers 
were involved, 80 percent of them conscripts. "I think that the 
fact that there were only 53 cases among 390,000 soldiers in 
1993 contradicts the impression of a shift to the right."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said that 
the elections to the European Parliament and the upcoming 
European Union [EU] summit on the Greek island of Corfu are 
important milestones on the road to the unity of the continent. 
About four months before the Bundestag election, the European 
election is also a particularly important domestic policy event, 
the chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU] said in a DPA interview in Bonn three days before the 
voting. 
  "After centuries of bitter wars between neighbors in Europe, 
the fact that elections will be held in 12 countries on Sunday 
[12 June] is a fantastic thing. We Germans need Europe more than 
all others," Kohl said. He announced that the Federal 
Government will make further attempts to considerably increase 
the rights and opportunities of influence of the parliament in 
Strasbourg in the near future. Since the Maastricht Treaty came 
into force, the 581 European representatives of the people have 
had the right of codetermination regarding the appointment of 
the European Commission members, including their president. The 
parliament also has to agree to international treaties and 
decide on the admission of the states that want to become 
members, he said. 
  It is Kohl's objective to discuss how internationally 
organized crime can be more effectively combated and a joint 
European asylum law be agreed upon in cooperation between the 
council, the parliament, and the commission at the conference 
reviewing the Maastricht Treaty in 1996. In the chancellor's 
opinion, the previous regulations are not enough. 
  Meanwhile, Kohl, French head of state Francois Mitterrand, 
and Spanish head of government Felipe Gonzalez have also set the 
course for the council presidency that will be consecutively 
performed by these three countries from 1 July on until the end 
of 1995 for six months each. "In these one-and-a-half years, we 
want to jointly initiate important things, for example, in the 
field of internal security," Kohl said. 
  Among other things, the formulation of a joint foreign and 
security policy is also at issue. "The war in the former 
Yugoslavia stresses the need for increased EU efforts." In 
Kohl's opinion, it is particularly important that, at the EU 
summit on 24 and 25 June in Corfu, attempts at reducing 
unemployment in the EU will be made. One has to focus on 
economic policy questions, for example, an adequate strategy in 
view of the challenge from Asian competitors and the integration 
of the reform states in East and southeast Europe. 
  "It cannot be unimportant to us whether these states are 
successful or not. If they relapse into old structures, this 
would have disastrous effects on all of us," Kohl said. As a 
troika, Kohl, Mitterrand, and Gonzalez also want to initiate a 
trans-European infrastructure, for example, in rail traffic. 
"It must be possible in the future to board a train in London 
and to leave it in Moscow after a trip across Europe. This is a 
first-rate offer of peace," the chancellor said.

  [Text] Heidelberg -- This evening French President 
Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed to the 
young people of their countries to support European unification. 
At a meeting of young people from France and Germany in 
Heidelberg, both statesmen emphasized that Europe's unification 
ensures peace and freedom for future generations. 
  Addressing about 6,000 young people, Mitterrand stressed 
that 
numerous rivalries and passions separated the Germans and the 
French in the past. The things that divide them must be 
overcome with an "invincible will." Franco-German 
reconciliation after World War II has paved the way for Europe. 
The European Union was founded by 12 states in Maastricht. 
Soon it will include 16 countries. "In the 21st century, we 
must think of the whole of Europe," the president stressed. 
Mitterrand pointed out that every country should "maintain its 
identity and be proud of its history," and "we must now develop 
a common history." 
  Kohl called on the young people to support the vision of 
united Europe with all their strength. Without the 
Franco-German partnership after World War II, the work of 
European unification would not have been initiated. The 
chancellor assessed the fact that so many young people 
participated in the meeting, which took place under the slogan 
"Shaping Europe," as proof that the two peoples have become 
friends. Kohl called on the young people to prevent a return of 
the evil specters of nationalism of the past. Every generation 
is facing this challenge anew. 
  Young people from German and French sports and other clubs, 
school and town partnerships, participants in exchange programs, 
and soldiers from the Franco-German brigade are participating in 
the meeting, which was also attended by the foreign ministers of 
both countries, Klaus Kinkel and Alain Juppe, and French 
Minister for Youth and Sports Michele Alliot-Marie and her 
German counterpart Angela Merkel. In the evening, Mitterrand 
and Kohl discussed ideas about a future Europe with 200 young 
people at the youth festival which was accompanied by musical 
and artistic events.

  [Text] Bonn -- Shortly before his meeting with French 
President Francois Mitterrand and young people from both 
countries in Heidelberg, Chancellor Helmut Kohl emphatically 
stressed the close partnership between the two states. The youth 
festival in the old university town, in which 6,000 people will 
participate, should be a "festival of joy" two days after the 
celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the landing of the 
Allied forces in Normandy, Kohl told DPA. 
  The chancellor again reaffirmed that at no point he 
expressed 
the wish to participate in the ceremonies of the allies. "I do 
not believe that the German chancellor should have been in 
Normandy that day." However, on the occasion of the 
anniversary, he and Mitterrand thought about what the French and 
the Germans could do to make it clear that the French and the 
German peoples have become friends "50 years afterward." 
  The deliberations led to the idea to organize a "festival of 
joy and friendship" with young people from both countries in 
Heidelberg. "We want to make it clear that we do not forget 
history, but that we want to learn from history," Kohl stated. 
Without the close partnership and friendship between France and 
Germany, a peaceful future in Europe is inconceivable.

  [Text] Bonn -- Florian Gerster (Social Democratic Party of 
Germany), Rhineland-Palatinate minister for federal affairs, has 
accused the Federal Government of pursuing a defense policy that 
is characterized by insecurity and aimlessness. At a 
security-political forum of the German Bundeswehr Association in 
Bonn today, Gerster called for a defense structure law that 
would stipulate the basic figures concerning the strength and 
deployment of the Bundeswehr. Moreover, "external ideas and 
wishes determine the planning of the Bundeswehr." The 
government should pursue a policy aimed at limiting the armed 
forces to a number that is required for the country's and the 
alliance's defense and for the international obligations. 
  In view of the difficult financial situation of the 
Bundeswehr, Inspector General Klaus Naumann appealed to the 
politicians to show the soldiers "the light at the end of the 
tunnel." The current situation is unbearable. A "critical 
point has been reached." The general mentioned big problems in 
the sphere of material preservation and ammunition for the 
exercises. He emphatically called on all parties to achieve a 
consensus on security issues. The credibility of the politicians 
must be ensured among the members of the Bundeswehr. 
  Former Inspector General Dieter Wellershoff, who is the 
president of the Federal Academy for Security Policy, warned the 
states against a return to nationalism. "This contagious 
disease is not only spreading in East Europe," Wellershoff 
pointed out. With its new political strategy, NATO is showing 
the only possible way out of this dilemma: cooperation. "In 
Europe, we all must find the right path between positive 
attachment to our country and an indispensable openness to the 
world and international solidarity," Wellershoff stressed.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government is concerned 
about the proliferation of carrier missiles and mass destruction 
weapons. An increasing number of Third World countries are 
trying to acquire such weapons, a report of the Federal 
Intelligence Office says, which was presented by State Minister 
in the Chancellor's Office Bernd Schmidbauer to the Cabinet on 
Wednesday [8 June]. 
  According to Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel, it is 
pointed 
out that North Korea is willing to sell its carrier systems to 
anyone who pays the necessary sum of money. It is to be assumed 
that more and more "threshold countries" are offering such 
systems and that missiles with a range of 1,000 km will already 
be available by the beginning of the next decade. The report 
comes to the conclusion that only a strict export regime and 
close international cooperation can prevent further 
proliferation.

  [Excerpts] Stuttgart (DPA) -- Some of the plutonium seized 
in a spectacular operation in Baden-Wuerttemberg comes from the 
production of nuclear weapons. On Wednesday [1 June] night, DPA 
learned from a reliable source about the preliminary results of 
tests carried out at the European Institute for Transuraniums at 
the Nuclear Research Center at Karlsruhe. 
  Ten percent of the total of 60 grams of radioactive powder 
are purest Plutonium 239 with an enrichment grade of 99 percent, 
which is generated only in the production of nuclear arms. It 
was further stated that neither the compound of the remaining 90 
percent of the powder nor its origin are known. This requires 
still further tests. Until now, the authorities had thought that 
the country of origin was an East European state. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to experts, the amount of the discovered plutonium 
is not sufficient for the construction of a nuclear bomb. Under 
optimal conditions, this would require at least 500-600 grams of 
pure Plutonium 239.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- As of immediately, German companies 
must not export antipersonnel mines any more. An export 
moratorium to this effect was adopted by the Federal Cabinet on 
Wednesday [8 June]. The regulation is limited to a period of 
three years, because, in the long term, the Federal Government 
is seeking an international solution. Exports for the purpose 
of examination and training within the framework of German NATO 
obligations are excluded from the moratorium. 
  Even now, the export of such mines are subject to the 
weapons 
export law. Export licenses for such arms were issued only for 
small numbers in the recent past, anyway. 
  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said that antipersonnel mines 
belong to the category of particularly cruel arms. Each week 
many civilians were killed or mutilated through such mines 
everywhere in the world. The current regulations are 
insufficient to protect the population. He was hoping that more 
countries would follow Germany's step, Kinkel said. 
  The Cabinet also made a decision in favor of rewriting the 
export list to step up export checks in sensitive areas. At the 
same time this will make exports easier and simplify procedures. 
The threshold values for computer and electronics will be 
raised. According to the Economics Ministry, the number of 
applications for export licenses filed at the responsible 
Federal Office will decline noticeably, which means a sizable 
reduction of the burden for export enterprises.

  [Text] Duesseldorf (DPA) -- Early Sunday morning [5 June], 
a bomb attack, which caused approximately 30,000 German marks in 
damages, was carried out on the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
district office in Duesseldorf. According to the police, a 
letter in which a leftist autonomous group claimed 
responsibility for the attack was found at the scene of the 
crime. At 0233, the rather amateurish bomb exploded between two 
windows in the courtyard of the office and destroyed several 
windowpanes and parts of the facade of the building. No one was 
injured. The 15 inhabitants of the building were temporarily 
evacuated. 
  The house with the seat of the CDU district association had 
already been scribbled on with paint before. Next Thursday, 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl (CDU) wants to take the floor at a 
European election event.

  [Text] Wiesbaden/Bonn -- Nearly one year after the 
unsuccessful antiterrorism operation in Bad Kleinen, Interior 
Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union [CDU]) has 
initiated the announced restructuring of the Federal Office of 
Criminal Investigation [BKA]. Ministry Spokesman Michael 
Griesbeck told DPA in Bonn today that, as an initial step, 
Kanther familiarized three new BKA main department heads with 
their future tasks yesterday. It is not yet clear when the 
newly created hierarchical level, which is to be controlled by 
the BKA president and vice president, will start its work. 
  According to information from security circles, Rudolf 
Atzbach, the old head of the BKA Central Administration 
Department, is to take over the planned Administration and Data 
Processing Main Department, according to Kanther's wishes. 
Leopold Schuster, the head of the Fight Against Drugs and 
Investigation Department, will lead the whole sphere of 
investigations and the records department. BKA department head 
Manfred Klink will be responsible for the Terrorism and 
Protection of the State Main Department, which will be based in 
Meckenheim near Bonn in the future. 
  Kanther's reform plans met with skepticism and rejection 
among the police trade union [GdP]. The new level of hierarchy 
that is to be introduced among the BKA president, the vice 
president, and the old department heads is in contradiction with 
all modern findings concerning control and organization, 
stressed Arno Falk, chairman of the GdP group in the BKA. The 
appointment of the new main department heads is the "wrong 
consequence from Bad Kleinen." 
  In fact, the GdP sees the need and the opportunity for 
restructuring the criminal office in Wiesbaden. Yet it rejects 
"rash and incompetent decisions, characterized by political 
opportunism." Falk called on the Bundestag officials 
responsible for domestic policy and the budget not to accept the 
plans for the BKA reform. 
  The Bundestag group of the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] 
wanted to adopt the planned amendment to the BKA law that was 
proposed by the interior minister before the summer recess. The 
accusation, leveled by opposition members and the GdP, that, as 
a result of the introduction of a new level of hierarchy, 
Kanther wants to "deprive BKA President Hans Ludwig Zachert of 
his power," has repeatedly been rejected by the interior 
minister. 
  During the bloody operation against the Red Army Faction 
[RAF] at the Bad Kleinen railway station in Mecklenburg Western 
Pomerania, police officer Michael Newrzella and suspected RAF 
terrorist Wolfgang Grams were killed in late June 1993. 
Suspected RAF member Birgit Hogefeld was arrested without being 
injured. The slip-ups during the police operation, for which 
the BKA, among others, was held responsible, led to the 
resignation of Interior Minister Rudolf Seiters (CDU) and 
Federal Public Prosecutor Alexander von Stahl.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by Josette </F>
Alia; place and date not given: "Alain Juppe: What Has Changed 
in Bosnia"] 
  [Text] [Alia] Since you became minister, you have clearly 
defined your positions on Bosnia. But you have not clearly 
explained the reasons why the policy you have pursued in power 
is different from the one you proposed in opposition. 
  [Juppe] Your publication has already expressed such a 
judgment by applying answers written in 1992 to questions posed 
in 1994, which I believe is not very honest intellectually, for 
at least two reasons. First, because the situation in the field 
has totally changed between 1992 and 1994. In 1992, when I 
called for air strikes, there were not 20,000 Blue Helmets in 
Bosnia and the Serbs did not occupy 70 percent of the country. 
We could still have dissuaded the Serbs from attacking -- and 
that is what we should have done -- whereas today we would have 
to eject them, which involves a totally different kind of 
military intervention. 
  Also, the policy pursued since 1993 is not the same as 
previously. We have set three new objectives: to identify and 
penalize the aggressor; to reduce the suffering of the 
population by using force if necessary; and to define and 
promote a peace plan. We first strongly condemned the Serb 
aggressor through the draconian sanctions imposed by the United 
Nations in April 1993. Since then, the embargo on the Danube 
and on the Adriatic coast has been better respected. The 
Serbian economy has been severely hit. If you do not see any 
change in policy in Paris, then let me tell you that they can 
certainly see it in Belgrade! 
  Second, we have pushed for the establishment of safe havens 
and succeeded in involving the Atlantic Alliance in this 
process, with the result that in February 1994 the NATO 
ultimatum and threats of air strikes saved the inhabitants of 
Sarajevo: There is now no bombing, fear is disappearing, the 
town is slowly coming to life, and we can now begin to work on 
its reconstruction. The same people who are now calling for 
capitulation then loudly applauded the ultimatum. Have they 
forgotten everything in four months? Finally, we have patiently 
drawn up a peace plan which enjoys the unanimous support of the 
major powers. Contrary to what [Socialist Party Secretary 
General] Michel Rocard may say, this plan has been adopted by 
the Twelve as the European Union's first foreign policy action. 
  [Alia] The way you stopped the suffering in Sarajevo has 
certainly won you unanimous praise. But there is the feeling 
that you subsequently abandoned demanding or rather obtaining 
the followup to this action, in Gorazde for example. 
  [Juppe] We did not abandon anything. And we also obtained an 
ultimatum in Gorazde. The shelling then ceased, the Serbian 
heavy weapons were withdrawn to outside a 3-km and later a 20-km 
zone. 
  [Alia] After much prevarication. 
  [Juppe] Yes. I said so at the time. They acted too late and 
too feebly in Gorazde. 
  [Alia] Who are "they?" 
  [Juppe] The special representative of the UN secretary 
general and the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander. But 
we can understand their position. They have men under fire. 
They thus prefer to avoid the use of air strikes and the 
potential risk of escalation. If I were in their position I 
would probably think the same. 
  [Alia] Do you believe we should continue with air strikes? 
  [Juppe] Certainly. UN and NATO decisions must be applied. 
When Serbian shells fall on the runway at Tuzla, even if they do 
not cause civilian casualties, we should strike at Serbian 
positions. I regret that we do not do this. We are calling for 
it, but it is not France that decides. 
  [Alia] Let us return to the essentials. This peace plan 
which has the backing of the entire international community. Do 
you find it fair and would it be lasting? 
  [Juppe] It is an essential step. When voices are raised in 
France or the United States to say to the Bosnians: "You must 
continue to fight, because you will achieve through force what 
you will not achieve through negotiation," I tremble! Do people 
who give such advice think of the responsibility they are 
taking? We are on a razor's edge at the moment. The situation 
in the field is stable, but the troops in the field are 
strengthening their positions and hostilities could break out 
again at any moment. 
  [Alia] Perhaps because we are trying to make the Muslims 
sign 
a peace plan which they refuse to accept. They are afraid that 
we are imposing a Serbian diktat. In order not to bring more 
war, some of them may feel that Serbian imperialism is being 
imposed without giving them the means to defend themselves 
against it. 
  [Juppe] We are not seeking to impose anything on anyone. We 
just want everyone to face up to their responsibilities. Is 
there really any question of ejecting the Serbs from Bosnia? 
There are Bosnian Serbs too and they accounted for 
approximately 35 percent of the country's population at the time 
of the last available census! The three "nationalities" (as was 
said at the time of the former Yugoslavia) must find a 
constitutional arrangement and a territorial settlement in order 
to learn how to live together again. That is the basis of our 
proposal. 
  [Alia] This "arrangement" is in fact a partition along 
ethnic and religious lines. 
  [Juppe] What is [Bosnian] President Izetbegovic proposing? 
The division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into two, with a 
Croato-Muslim area covering 58 percent of the territory. What 
does the Geneva plan propose? A Croato-Muslim area covering 51 
percent of the territory. That is the problem. With 58 
percent, we would be respecting, they say, international 
morality, right, and justice. With 51 percent, we would be 
blamed with capitulation and the acceptance of an ethnic 
division! Does the difference between good and evil lie in 7 
percent more or less land? I also remind you that the Geneva 
proposal (51/49) was accepted by all the parties last December. 
  [Alia] But why deny the aggressed the right to defend 
themselves against the aggressors? 
  [Juppe] It is a question of deciding whether you want war or 
peace. If you want war, then you simply have to lift the 
embargo and give arms to everybody. But, even supposing that 
were desirable, how would you do it? You would need a new 
Security Council resolution. But the Russians have already said 
that they would veto it. So would you ignore the Security 
Council resolutions? That would be the end of the United 
Nations. 
  [Alia] Raising the possibility alone could be a means of 
exerting pressure on the negotiations. As when you threaten to 
withdraw Blue Helmets, which would also certainly result in 
massacres. 
  [Juppe] The withdrawal of the Blue Helmets is, as I have 
said 
100 times, the solution of despair. If we fail, we will have no 
alternative but that. But we are not about to resign ourselves 
to failure. The negotiations still have a chance of succeeding. 
The chances are even higher now that the Americans, Europeans, 
and Russians are on the same wavelength. Unless we step up the 
bellicose declarations which can very easily thwart any chances 
of peace. The war will then extend to the Balkans as a whole. 
I want people to know this because that can happen. But the 
purpose of my struggle is to avoid the worst. You do not stop a 
war by supplying arms. You stop it by drawing up a plan which 
all parties can accept. 
  [Alia] Does not this plan based on military gains set a 
terrible precedent for other countries, in particular in the 
former Soviet Union? 
  [Juppe] Military victory for the Serbs would be to retain 70 
percent of the territory they occupy, the disappearance of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina as a state, and drawing a veil over ethnic 
cleansing. We are not going to accept that. 
  [Alia] But is not your solution, at the very least, 
pragmatic 
and imperfect, if not immoral. 
  [Juppe] It is a compromise. I do not know if it is right. I 
feel it is balanced and that it provides a way of stopping the 
fighting. It is not by proclaiming that it is bad that we are 
going to boost its chances of success! 
  [Alia] But we have conducted negotiations while proclaiming 
that we are not going to intervene. 
  [Juppe] These negotiations are in the process of succeeding. 
  [Alia] What guarantees have you that the agreement will be 
applied by the fighters in the field? 
  [Juppe] The signature of all three. And the presence of an 
international force on the spot to see to it that the agreement 
is respected. President Clinton has affirmed that, in such 
circumstances, U.S. soldiers would be present in the field. And 
we would maintain the presence of our Blue Helmets. We are 
already working on achieving international status for Sarajevo; 
the European representative who has to administer the town of 
Mostar has been appointed; credits are being arranged. That is 
the combat we are pursuing. What is the alternative? Today 
there are more than 200 Serbian guns guarded by French Blue 
Helmets in the exclusion zone around Sarajevo. Are we to give 
guns to the Bosnians so that they can go on the offensive? Is 
it not better, on the contrary, to seek to remove heavy weapons 
from those who have them, and to demilitarize zones under 
international control? 
  [Alia] Do you believe that present negotiations are going to 
succeed? 
  [Juppe] There is a chance. The Croats accept the Geneva 
plan. The Serbs accept the Geneva plan. I believe that the 
Muslims would accept the 51/49-percent split as they did in 
Geneva last December, if we also designate 4 to 5 percent as 
"gray areas" under UN control. 
  [Alia] You cannot deny that French public opinion in general 
is deeply affected by what is happening in the former 
Yugoslavia. The entry of the "Sarajevo" list in the European 
election campaign is proof of that. 
  [Juppe] And me, am I not deeply affected? Do you feel, when 
you listen to me, that the situation in Bosnia has not affected 
me over the past 14 months? I believe that France has done its 
duty. And its duty is to prepare for reconstruction in Bosnia, 
and not for war in Bosnia.

  [Editorial Report] "Bloodshed--one's own and that of 
others--is practically a natural element of an emerging 
country," writes Gerard Dupuy in the 27 April Paris daily 
LIBERATION. This "democratic celebration of death, both given 
and received," has marked the history of the two last centuries, 
he continues. However, it is as if those countries that first 
invented this "bloody baptism" have distanced themselves from it 
to the point of considering it a "negation of their own ideals." 
Democracies, Dupuy comments, no longer want to see blood, 
beginning with that of their own people. This "fear of death" is 
one of the fundamental rules of the modern political contract 
and can be "intuitively" understood when applied to domestic 
policy. The inherent contradiction is only revealed when 
crossing into foreign policy, for the principle in no way 
dovetails with the most gigantic accumulation of the means of 
death ever seen. However, the public's "detestation" of violence 
and blood does not lead it to pacifism and the "virtues of 
passive resistance." Leaders are thus confronted by a strange 
demand: obtain the results of war without exposure to the damage 
it entails. The Persian Gulf War was a "remarkable 
interpretation" of this demand, Dupuy argues, since it aimed at 
winning without risking soldiers' deaths, not even the enemies', 
which were reduced to "collateral damage." The "new world order" 
could thus be imagined, since it possessed the adequate 
instrument for regulation. Since then, however, various peoples 
"have not given up killing each other," Dupuy writes. The horror 
of bloodshed has brought back the old contradictory need to use 
naked force while refusing to bear its effects. The term 
"cowardice" has been used a little too quickly, he adds, as if 
leaders needed "courage" to send soldiers to their deaths--for 
which "a good dose of cynicism is sufficient." "Cowardice" is 
apparent among those who advocate an open intervention in full 
awareness of its bloody consequences, because they know that 
even a genuinely concerned public is not ready to witness the 
shedding of its own soldiers' blood, just as it is unprepared to 
bear passively the image of the violence they may have to 
inflict. In reality, neither side is a coward, Dupuy concludes. 
"They are powerless because of internal limitations, and 
paralyzed by a contradiction no one can understand." 
  In his 23 April editorial in the Paris weekly LE POINT, 
Claude Imbert notes the West's powerlessness in preventing 
massacres around the world. While an "American-inspired sudden 
burst" of NATO may temporarily erase the UN's "humiliation" in 
Bosnia, it will not bring any lasting change to Europe's 
inability to have those principles it wishes to export respected 
at home, Imbert writes. While the French must certainly defend 
their values, notably in their own country, the state cannot 
ignore its limitations with regard to "international policing." 
Thus, when this "cold monster" wants to impose French values on 
others, it must secure the means--even if military--to do so, 
"lest it offer an image of bravado." It is thus "audacious" to 
affirm the "universalism of our mission," Imbert continues, 
especially when the West is tolerating the death of hundreds of 
thousands in Africa, where "our compassion does not suggest 
peacemaking expeditions." France's "universalism," he notes, 
"evaporates in the tropics," and for good reason, since "the 
rice sacks seen on television destined for Somalia had to be 
delivered by the military which in turn needed a state apparatus 
to humanize the Somalian crisis, and that, then, implied the 
restitution of a colonial order." At this point, Imbert 
comments, "we silently stole away." Of course, he continues, 
Bosnia is in Europe and while European interests there are more 
closely engaged, it is not as if European nations would declare 
war against Belgrade, given that Europe is faced with the local 
populations' "rabid" desire to carve out a niche of their own. 
"Our European duty," Imbert continues, is to prevent the worst 
massacres and pave the way for a political settlement. The 
United Nations, he writes, "can do only what a Tower of Babel 
can, that is, very little." As for NATO, "it does what U.S. 
public opinion dictates," and Europe, the most directly 
concerned, "does almost nothing because it is a body with a 
divided head and no arms." French foreign policy "circulates as 
it can in this political-military maquis." Imbert asks his 
readers not to condemn it, but rather condemn "our people and 
our guides who for 40 years have rejected a military Europe." 
"Between what is happening, what is expected and what can be 
done, words should conform to acts," he concludes.

  [Editorial Report] What the press has called the "Tapie 
phenomenon"--the rise in popularity of Bernard Tapie, leader of 
the Radical Energy list running for the European Parliament--is 
discussed by Jerome Jaffre in the 5-11 May Paris weekly LE 
NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. 
  Tapie's popularity was confirmed by the results of a SOFRES 
[French Opinion Polling Company] poll conducted on behalf of LE 
NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR from 26 to 28 April among 1,000 individuals 
over 18 who were personally interviewed. Respondents were asked 
the following questions: 
  "Do you have the feeling that in the Euroelections Tapie 
would..." reinforce the Left by attracting voters who would not 
vote for it: 39 percent. Weaken the Left by lowering the score 
of the list of Socialist Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard facing 
the Rally for the Republic (RPR)-Union for French Democracy 
(UDF) list: 36 percent. No opinion: 25 percent. 
  "In your opinion, is Tapie a demagogue who could easily be a 
danger to democracy, or a man who comes from the people and is 
able to speak for them?" A demagogue who could easily be as 
danger to democracy: 30 percent A man who comes from the people 
and is able to speak for them: 56 percent. No opinion: 14 
percent. 
  According to Jaffre, the poll also included some 
"surprises." 
The vote for Tapie cannot spring from the populist behavior of 
anti-Maastricht voters, given that out of 100 Tapie voters, 59 
percent said they voted "yes," in the 1992 Maastricht 
referendum, with only 16 percent voting "no" and 25 percent 
abstaining or casting a blank ballot. Similarly, 62 percent did 
not think that European integration threatens French identity, 
56 percent thought that the disappearance of the European Union 
(EU) would be serious for France, and only 17 percent wished 
that European integration were slower. A second "surprise" was 
that despite President Francois Mitterrand's perceived pro-Tapie 
stance--which has been widely discussed in the press--the Tapie 
electorate is much less "Mitterandist" than Michel Rocard's. 
Some 73 percent of Rocard supporters trust the president, 
compared with 54 percent of Tapie voters. Mitterrand's 
presidential action was judged positively by 77 percent of 
Rocard voters, compared with 61 percent of Tapie supporters. 
Similarly, the Tapie electorate is neither opposed to Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur nor "frankly hostile" to the Right, 
Jaffre commented. Some 55 percent trust the prime minister, 
against 40 percent among Rocard voters, while 41 percent of 
Tapie voters trust Rally for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques 
Chirac, compared with 26 percent of Rocard supporters. Finally, 
on SOFRES' traditional Left-Right axis, 57 percent of Tapie 
voters situated themselves in the center or even on the Right.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Martino Welcomes Accord With </F>
Russia"] 
  [Excerpts] (ANSA) Istanbul, June 9 -- The conditions under 
which NATO has given Russia access to its Partnership for Peace 
reconcile the need for recognising Russian great-power status 
with avoiding any impression of a preferential relationship that 
might leave other East and Central European states in a 
subordinate position, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino 
said here today. 
  "An extraordinarily useful meeting," commented Martino who 
was at his debut with the sixteen NATO nations and added that 
the final shape of the agreement, which could be signed before 
the Group of Seven summit in Naples, provides a "happy wedding" 
between the two requirements. 
  According to Martino, Russia had to be accorded great-power 
status, even after the Soviet Union's disintegration, for 
domestic and international reasons. At the same time, the East 
and Central European countries had to be reassured that they 
would be left in "subordination to a hegemony." 
  Since the debate on Russian relations with NATO began as the 
Cold War faded into the past, the need to accord Russia 
great-power status has been a constant in Italian foreign 
policy, not only because it is a nuclear power, but because of 
the contribution it can make in terms of political stability. 
  The Partnership for Peace has already been signed by another 
20 East European and ex-Soviet states. To reassure them, the 
NATO foreign ministers said the pact would enter specific 
accords with Moscow only as regards issues not covered by the 
partnership. These include nuclear non-proliferation and 
cooperation against terrorism. 
  Martino, who confirmed the continuity of the Italian 
commitment to NATO, said that another problem would be to watch 
out for Russian attempts to water down the alliance's "identity" 
to the benefit of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, with the idea of "somehow legitimising the latter's 
right to interfere in NATO's decisions." Martino also urged the 
European nations to make a greater contribution to NATO and to 
take on greater responsibilities within it. 
  He also told reporters that the situation in Rwanda was 
"extremely complex." He added that something had to be done to 
halt the tragedy, also voicing hope in the success of UN 
attempts to send in a contingent of 5,500 men from African 
countries under a decision taken last night. 
  As far as Italy is concerned, he said, there would be no 
"hasty decisions not linked to the UN or the countries 
involved." He added that the Italian government will decide 
next Tuesday [14 June] on whom it intends to support as the 
successor to Jacques Delors as European Commission president. 
  According to Martino, the government will also be deciding 
on 
the candidates Italy will be proposing for the other major 
international organisations, from the European Union to NATO, 
the Western European Union, and the OECD. To date, the only 
official Italian candidate is ex-Foreign Trade Minister Renato 
Ruggiero to head the World Trade Organisation, which will 
replace GATT. 
  Martino said Italy plans to propose a packet of names, 
deciding in which cases to advance Italian candidatures and when 
the candidates of other countries will be backed. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to NATO's deputy secretary-general, Sergio 
Balanzino, however, today's agreement confirms that NATO and 
Russia have now truly begun on the task of building a new 
security system in Europe. 
  At today's talks, the NATO diplomatic chiefs also agreed to 
keep a closer watch on growing instability in the Mediterranean 
region, studying eventual moves that may prove necessary. 
  (Interviewed on a Fininvest news and chat show in Rome, 
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi noted that a constant 
in Italian policy had been to insist on Russia's presence at the 
Naples summit and in the Partnership for Peace.) 
  (He also said the Italian position had been to insist on a 
more important role for Russia in the partnership than the four 
Central and East European countries that have already joined and 
are seeking EU membership.) 
  ("We'll receive greater consideration internationally, if we 
resolve our problems of public finance, criminality and 
corruption," he added.) 
  In a bilateral meeting, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe' 
told Martino that the section of the Naples summit involving 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin would be an appropriate 
framework for seeking new impetus for a solution of the Bosnian 
crisis at the highest level. Official sources said that Martino 
and Juppe' agreed on the need for a more effective negotiating 
mechanism if a political solution was to be found. [passage

Refugees"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 2 -- Some 30 tonnes of emergency 
aid for Rwanda will be flown on Friday [3 June] from Italy to 
the Ugandan town of Entebbe, where it will be distributed to 
refugees from the Rwandan civil war, the Foreign Ministry said 
on Thursday. 
  Another plane with a further 30 tonnes of aid will fly to 
Bujumbura, Burundi, for refugees there. 
  Medical equipment provided by Italy arrived in Burundi 
today, 
and another consignment will be sent to the Ugandan capital 
Kampala within the next few days. 
  These latest initiatives are part of an emergency programme 
for a total of almost ten billion lire (6.2 million dollars) 
financed by the Foreign Ministry's cooperation department.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda: Pope on Killings, Martino </F>
on Italian Contribution"] 
  [Excerpts] (ANSA) Rome, June 9 -- Recent killings of 
Catholic clergy in Rwanda have left Pope John Paul II "deeply 
upset," the pope said in a letter to Rwandan clergy on Thursday 
[9 June]. 
  Responding to reports that more than 20 members of the 
clergy, including Kigali's Archbishop Vincent Nsengiyimva, were 
killed earlier this week along with over 60 civilians, the 
pontiff called on all those involved in the bloody civil war to 
"do everything possible to ensure that the paths of concord and 
reconstruction are soon opened up in the country, which has been 
so seriously rent apart." [passage omitted] 
  In a vote last night, the UN Security Council gave the 
go-ahead for a 5,500-strong contingent to be sent to Rwanda to 
protect refugees, deciding that the contingent would be made up 
entirely of African soldiers, and that it would not be able to 
resort to arms to end conflicts. Although personnel is standing 
by ready to go to the war-torn African country, logistical and 
support equipment is still lacking and may take three weeks to 
put together, UN sources said. 
  (In Istanbul for an Atlantic Council meeting of NATO foreign 
ministers, Italy's diplomatic chief Antonio Martino ruled out 
any form of intervention which was not closely coordinated with 
the UN. "We all want to do something, and we all should do 
something, but we also have to avoid acting hastily, and not in 
connection with the UN and the other countries involved," said 
Martino.) 
  (According to the Italian minister, the situation in Rwanda 
is "a human tragedy of biblical proportions," and "extremely 
complex.") 
  (Asked whether Italy would be sending any troops to Rwanda, 
Martino recalled the UN's insistence in letting African soldiers 
deal with the problem, and pointed out that even countries with 
direct links with Rwanda, such as Belgium and France, have not 
been allowed to take part in UN efforts despite offers to this 
effect.) [passage omitted]

Riccardo Orizio; place and date not given: "The Foreign

  [Text] "I rule out the possibility that a `sharing-out' 
agreement has been reached, and that Italy has been excluded 
from it. Rather, the truth is that talks are still under way 
and are unlikely to reach a conclusion before the Corfu European 
summit in June. The Italian Government is determined to ensure

account, but all of them. As a matter of fact, over the last 
few days we have been considering some very authoritative 
candidacies on our part, and we are in the process of 
establishing contacts with a number of European partners, which 
are not necessarily those mentioned by THE GUARDIAN (i.e., 
France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and 
Portugal -- CORRIERE DELLA SERA editor's note)." 
  Forza Italia Senator Livio Caputo, who is the foreign under 
secretary in charge of European and security affairs, is 
currently in Cairo attending the conference of nonaligned 
countries. However, he has not lost sight of Brussels and the 
complex negotiations concerning the international organizations' 
key posts. 
  [Orizio] Is it not true that the game is over? 
  [Caputo] No, there is still plenty of time and room for 
Italy. We have been hampered by the fact that the long 
government crisis prevented us from concentrating on the 
negotiations right from their initial stages, but we are still 
in time to join. The prime minister's office is examining the 
candidacies that we intend to submit. 
  [Orizio] What institutions is Italy aiming for? 
  [Caputo] Three in particular: OECD, GATT, and NATO. 
  [Caputo] Of these three objectives, how many will we 
actually 
achieve? 
  [Orizio] It may prove difficult to achieve all three, but we 
will submit a sufficiently broad range of candidates not to be 
excluded from the final agreement. In the end, we will have the 
right man for the right job. 
  [Orizio] Former Minister Renato Ruggiero is being mentioned 
as a possible candidate for one of the great European 
institutions. Is this correct? 
  [Caputo] It is not appropriate to mention any names at this 
stage. 
  [Orizio] As far as NATO is concerned, THE GUARDIAN is saying 
that an agreement has already been reached on the name of 
outgoing Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers. 
  [Caputo] NATO is not solely a European institution. 
Americans have traditionally exercised a strong influence on 
the choice of the secretary general, and I do not believe that 
they will cease doing so in the future. When it comes to 
choosing somebody, therefore, I would not be surprised if an 
outsider wins the race in the end. 
  [Orizio] Belgian Prime Minister Dehaene is being mentioned 
as 
Delors' successor at the European Commission. Does Italy agree 
with this? 
  [Caputo] It is no mystery that France and Germany are 
pressing for Dehaene's appointment. However, there are other 
candidates, too: for example, Irishman Peter Sutherland (former 
EC commissioner and outgoing GATT secretary general -- CORRIERE 
DELLA SERA editor's note). 
  [Orizio] However, should the fact that THE GUARDIAN is 
predicting Italy's complete exclusion from this European 
distribution of posts not be regarded as a further indication of 
our country's international isolation? 
  [Caputo] No. THE GUARDIAN is a newspaper which often runs 
ahead of events, and, in any case, it does not represent the 
views of the British Government, from which in fact it is rather 
far removed. Several European countries taking part in the 
negotiations have unambiguously expressed their friendship and 
appreciation for us, and our government's composition will not 
be an obstacle to the negotiations' success.

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F>
Gianluigi Da Rold; place and date not given: "Bossi: Two-Year 
Armed Truce With Berlusconi"] 
  [Text] Milan -- "[Former League ideologue] Miglio and 
Castellazzi? No, they are not the problems. The last thing we 
need is for someone engaged in politics to have to worry about 
Miglio. The problem is [Prime Minister] Berlusconi, who is now 
returning to his job selling detergent. It is he who is behind 
it all. It is he who, lacking any ideals, is trying to acquire 
other people's." This was the old [League Secretary] Umberto 
Bossi talking, with great frankness when necessary. But this 
time, after his usual "appeals against Berlusconism," he was 
cautious and reasonable too, at a time when it is necessary to 
define the Northern League's course for the coming months. 
  [Da Rold] Mr. Bossi, you talk about a situation in flux. 
When will a balance be reached? 
  [Bossi] In two years, at the next general election. 
  [Da Rold] What? Another general election? 
  [Bossi] No, take this down carefully: A balance will be 
reached in two years, or at the next general election. I will 
not jeopardize the country's governability. At present 
governability is a common asset, an asset demanded by the 
people. In connection with certain legislation, certain issues, 
we will play our part to the full; we are not accustomed to 
betraying the voters. But we will not jeopardize the country's 
governability. [Bossi ends] 
  Bossi did not say so explicitly, but he made it very clear: 
a two-year truce for the Berlusconi government, partly an 
"armed" truce, with sharp distinctions between the League and 
the other government forces, and the possibility that other 
majorities could take shape in Parliament over certain 
legislation. 
  [Da Rold] Pardon me, Mr. Bossi, you emphasize governability, 
but at the same time you are not avoiding causes of conflict. A 
"Tiziana Parenti case" is emerging over the Mafia Committee, and 
you are recommending Pino Arlacchi, that is, the opposition 
candidate. The other day in Da Rold Parenti called you dishonest 
and a destabilizer. 
  [Bossi] She talks virtually like Miglio. She is like Miglio. 
I am mistrustful of magistrates who engage in politics; I have a 
preconceived suspicion in their regard. Be that as it may, let 
us not turn this into a personal issue. I am simply saying that 
it is right that the minority be granted the chairmanships of 
some of the committees. Yes, of course, we have a 
first-past-the-post system. Some people say that we should take 
everything. But it is wrong to believe that everything in this 
country can change all at once. And just consider what the 
opposition is doing. It is just as well that we have the 
Interior Ministry. 
  [Da Rold] Is it not the case, rather, that you are trying to 
flirt with [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto and 
the Left? 
  [Bossi] No, there is absolutely no flirting. What I am 
saying is that we must beware of the problems that could emerge 
in the streets. In other words, if anyone wants to be stubborn 
about that committee, then let them. We will play our part, 
then we shall see, and the country will judge who is more 
democratic or not. 
  [Da Rold] But all this means that in certain instances -- 
such as this business of the Mafia Committee -- different 
majorities could take shape. 
  [Bossi] Other majorities. In connection with certain bills, 
I will defer to nobody. In other words, there are some things 
that are part of the country's assets. For instance, 
privatization, antitrust legislation, federalism, and 
institutional reforms. I repeat: We are not accustomed to 
betraying people. We conducted our election campaign on those 
points, and we will play our part on those points. This, 
without jeopardizing the country's governability, but saying 
what we believe. Then the country will judge. [Bossi ends] 
  This seems like Bossi's old "stop-go" policy. He is obliged 
to govern with Berlusconi, but at the same time to distinguish 
himself from the great television charmer. 
  [Da Rold] Pardon me, Mr. Bossi. Now President Scalfaro is 
challenging anyone to prove that the Sisde funds were misspent. 
But those funds did exist.... 
  [Bossi] I do not want to talk about this business. Why 
should I too start demolishing everything? In these two years 
there will be some major reforms to carry out. And maybe it 
will occur to some people to set presidentialism against 
federalism. Maybe some people want to change the electoral law. 
Everyone knows on which side I will fight. 
  [Da Rold] But is there not an immediate issue concerning Mr. 
Scalfaro? 
  [Bossi] Why should I demolish everything? It is possible to 
talk to Scalfaro. In the meantime let him remain there, 
irrespective of what emerges in his regard. 
  [Da Rold] These two years will be truly decisive. 
  [Bossi] The transition from the First Republic to the Second 
has not taken place yet. It will take place when the 
Constitution is changed. The reforms must be carried out in 
these two years. Now the League has established itself and will 
fight for the new; the battle starts now. Previously we avoided 
this battle; we were in difficulties, on steep paths. Now we 
are on flat ground. 
  [Da Rold] The League too has its problems. Let me remind you 
again of Miglio and Castellazzi. 
  [Bossi] They are like the blind leading the blind. And, like 
in the parable, they will both fall down -- on the Right. 
  [Da Rold] How would you describe the League at present? 
  [Bossi] As a force of struggle and government. Not as 
Berlinguer did with the PCI [Italian Communist Party], because 
he was not part of the government, but only of the patronage 
system. 
  [Da Rold] What about the Berlusconi government hitherto? 
  [Bossi] A few things, some of them good, albeit obviously 
only aspirins. I protest only at the fact that there was no 
support for Slovenia's entry into Europe.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Government Suffers Setback in </F>
Senate Chair Vote"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 2 -- The government of Premier 
Silvio Berlusconi suffered further setbacks in the Senate today 
as voting for the last chairs of the standing committees saw 
three more going to the opposition, for a total of eight, while 
those held by the government coalition rose only from three to 
five. 
  Today's vote saw the election for the opposition of Aldo 
Corasaniti, Democratic Left, to chair the Constitutional Affairs 
Committee, and Giangiacomo Migone, of the Progressives, as head 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee, after government candidate 
Giovanni Spadolini withdrew his candidacy. 
  A run-off vote was held for the Chairman of the Defense 
Committee, after the first ballot draw, with the opposition 
Progressive candidate Raffaele Bertoni edging out Luigi Ramponi 
of the National Alliance, the government's candidate. 
  The government Freedom Alliance took only the Justice 
Committee chair with Antonio Guarra of the National Alliance, 
while Giorgio Brambilla of the Northern League was elected to 
helm the Environment Committee. 
  The 8-5 defeat of the government in securing the Senate 
committee chairs was seen by many observers to be the result of 
conflict within the government coalition, especially between 
Prime Minister Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the Northern League 
of Umberto Bossi, as well as the government's refusal to 
politically bargain with some opposition forces, such as the 
former Christian Democrats of the People's party, viewed by the 
latter as a sign of the government's arrogance. 
  Forza Italia has been particularly critical of the Northern 
League which it has accused of "irresponsible" behavior, just 
short of betrayal for having allegedly bargained with the Left. 
  Tiziana Maiolo, the Forza Italia chairman of the House 
Justice Committee, this morning said it was indispensable that 
the forces making up the government coalition clear up their 
difference and reach an operative consensus. 
  In reference to the "irresponsible" Northern League, she 
said 
"I hope this behavior ends after June 12 (European elections), 
that bit is just a preelection ploy and not permanent, otherwise 
we will have to go to early elections." Any eventual early 
elections, she added, would have to involve both House and 
Senate because at question would be the government coalition 
itself. 
  According to Maiolo, the government coalition's position to 
reject candidates from the opposition was a guarantee for 
Berlusconi to keep the government in the center. 
  Forza Italia House whip Raffaele Della Valle was also in 
favor of the coalition summit and observed "It is never negative 
that a government coalition meet to examine the performance of 
its individual members." 
  Looking at the government setback in the Senate, Della Valle 
said "This result is the consequence of an election which 
produced a framework of total uncertainty in the Senate. I 
don't think it is yet the case to emphasize or dramatize this 
result which is, without a doubt, negative, but which must be 
taken for what it is. I don't think it is cause to take a step 
as drastic as dissolving the Senate. Certainly, it makes it 
harder to work, for the majority." 
  Della Valle then observed "the commission votes should be 
examined carefully for there is something in the coalition which 
isn't working. This is what should be subject to an in-depth 
examination by the majority and the government." 
  Michele Sellitti, Senate whip for the Socialist group, said 
the chair vote was a "warning to the majority on the need for 
dialogue with the opposition.... We recognized its right to 
chair the 13 standing committees and asked that the opposition 
be given the chair of the Commissions for Control. The 
confrontation developed due to the total lack of openness by the 
majority to an absolutely reasonable and legitimate hypothesis 
as this." 
  The Senate whip for the National Alliance, Giulio 
Maceratini, 
had a different view and said "Either the political framework 
changes or we go to new elections because this is no way to 
govern." He, too, agreed that an eventual early vote would have 
to be for both houses of parliament, even though the 
Constitution allows for dissolving only the Senate. "The result 
(of the Senate vote) was undoubtedly negative, but it was a 
battle fought with unequal arms." 
  After being accused by its allies of not abiding to 
coalition 
agreements, the National Alliance today issued a statement 
claiming it had the right to ask that "Forza Italia and the 
National Alliance clarify their positions." 
  A party communique went on to criticize the hard-line its 
coalition partners had adopted in the Senate chair vote and said 
that unless differences were resolved, then early election would 
be necessary. 
  According to the Northern League, Forza Italia and the 
National Alliance had been amateur in not recognizing the 
opposition's right to chair the Bicameral Control Committees and 
had "failed to listen to the Northern League's advice." 
  The results of the election for Senate committee chairmen 
saw 
the government coalition win the chairs for Justice, Budget, 
Public Works, Health and the Environment Committees, while the 
opposition will head the Committee for Constitutional Affairs, 
Foreign Affairs, Defense, Finance, Education, Agriculture, 
Industry and Labor.
