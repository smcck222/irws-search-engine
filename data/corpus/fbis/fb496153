<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Election Campaign Unfair, </F>
Opposition Claims"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 1 -- The European Parliament 
election campaign is being waged unfairly because of the 
government's control over mass media and because media watchdog 
authorities are unable to do their job effectively, according to 
a delegation from eight opposition parties who on Wednesday [1 
June] protested to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. 
  "Today's newspapers said six million Italians on March 27 
voted according to what they had seen on television," Mario 
Segni of the Pact for Italy said after the meeting, adding that 
the opposition has asked Scalfaro and the head of the media 
watchdog body, Giuseppe Santaniello, to make sure that "the 
violations that took place then do not happen again." 
  Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government effectively 
controls the country's six largest television networks and the 
TV election campaign is slanted in favor of Berlusconi's Forza 
Italia and the far-right National Alliance parties, according to 
the opposition. 
  Berlusconi owns the three largest private Fininvest 
channels, 
which are accused of charging exorbitant fees for campaign 
advertising, while debates on the three public TV channels of 
the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] network have been 
virtually "absent" even though the elections are less than two 
weeks away, the delegates claimed. 
  Santaniello reportedly told the delegation he had no way of 
evaluating coverage by RAI because all the computers at Pavia 
University, which traditionally does the job, have been recently 
debilitated by a virus. The University usually provides 
percentage figures and "positive-negative" coverage ratings for 
individual parties appearing on RAI channels. 
  The opposition also claims that thanks to his ownership of 
Fininvest and simultaneous leadership of Forza Italia "clubs" 
throughout Italy, Berlusconi is getting virtually free 
advertizing on his own TV channels. 
  Carlo Ripa Di Meana, a former European Commissioner for the 
environment who is running in the June 12 elections for the 
Greens, said he was "dissatisfied" with today's meeting with 
Scalfaro and called the measures promised by Santaniello 
"unsatisfactory," also because it is now too late to make much 
difference. 
  Opposition parties also told the president of alleged 
widespread violations of laws that provide each party with space 
for campaign posters, and asked that member of parliament 
Vittorio Sgarbi, who is also chairman of the Cultural Affairs 
Commission, should not be allowed to continue broadcasting his 
daily one-man televised political commentaries on one of the 
Fininvest channels. 
  Scalfaro allegedly promised he would meet with Berlusconi 
today to address the issues raised by the opposition parties. 
  Opposition forces that sent representatives to the meeting 
with Scalfaro were the Left Democrats, Pact for Italy, People's 
Party, Liberals, Greens, Network, Democratic Alliance and Marco 
Pannella, leader of the ticket bearing his own name.

<F P=106> [Interview with MSI Youth Front member Alessandro Ambrosini </F>
by CORRIERE DELLA SERA correspondent Massimo Nava; place and 
date not given: "We Are Different From the Germans: Salo Is 
Present in Our Ideals"] 
  [Text] Vicenza--He had joined the Youth Front--the youth 
organization of Fini's party--only six months before and had 
convinced some of his "comrades" to join the National Alliance. 
"It was a tactical conversion, for the purpose of pressing 
forward with our struggles and our values," explains Alessandro 
Ambrosini, 22, a political science student at the University of 
Padua, who wears his beard and hair in the style of Che Guevara 
despite his "Naziskin" past and his predilection for Roman 
salutes, which he says "are for us what the clenched fist is for 
the Left." 
  He was welcomed with open arms, among other things because 
the Front in only a few weeks "reached 150 members" and because 
these young men with their "testicles of marble" had made a 
noteworthy contribution to the MSI [Italian Socialist Movement] 
election campaign in Vicenza with their frenzied activism, which 
consisted of composing handwritten manifestoes at night and 
devoting entire days to distributing fliers door to door. 
  Alessandro Ambrosini in this way obtained his stripes as 
secretary of the Youth Front and also the esteem of the party's 
top leadership, in addition to a provincial notoriety as an 
artist, because Alessandro and his friends--with their "Black 
Rats" rock group--were preparing for the Sanremo festival. 
  But his heart yearned for the surroundings that he had 
frequented ever since his teenage years, and for the Naziskins, 
with whom "you get together on Saturday night, at the 
discotheque or the beer hall." And the rallies in Vicenza--with 
the Roman salutes and the swastikas--held an irrestible 
attraction for Alessandro. He preferred street demonstrations to 
a career in the party. 
  They had warned him in the federation, but he went there 
anyway in the company of his friend Piero Puschiavo, the 
acknowledged head of the Vicenza Naziskins. "It is a friendship 
that I am not going to repudiate. Piero is a valiant fellow--a 
working man, not the head of a gang. They have constructed a 
myth in an effort to discredit him." 
  Puschiavo's parents are of the same opinion, and greet with 
insults and threats any journalists who approach their little 
house in Gambellara. Piero does not talk to the press and has 
made only one telephone call to IL GIORNALE DI VICENZA: "My 
fellow residents of Vicenza," he said, "need not worry. We are 
not going to organize new street demonstrations. The autonomists 
are allowed to hold them, so why aren't we? We certainly did not 
want to cause all this uproar." 
  [Ambrosini] I have marched with my comrades to demand 
justice. I am participating personally, as a gesture of 
solidarity in opposition to the attacks by the autonomists, 
which have gone unpunished. I have had to resign from the party, 
in anticipation of my expulsion, but I repudiate nothing. 
Certain values must be defended. 
  [Nava] Even racial hatred, Mussolini, Hitler, and Hess? 
  [Ambrosini] The Italian Naziskins are different from the 
German ones. We oppose violence against immigrants; we are 
fighting to save our European culture. That is different. The 
Naziskins are not empty heads, as Fini says. We are also putting 
some good ideas into practice. 
  [Nava] Such as? 
  [Ambrosini] Such as the fight against drugs and crime; the 
campaign against homosexual marriages; and a reassessment of the 
Republic of Salo, not as a historical event that cannot be 
repeated but as a set of ideals, of universal values. The 
fascist style, let us say. 
  [Nava] And also the denial of the Holocaust. 
  [Ambrosini] I have read Irwin, but I do not agree with him. 
It is not possible to deny the Holocaust. Nor do I agree with 
anti-Semitism. My friend Puschiavo is of the same opinion. 
  [Nava] Fortunately. From what you say, however, the National 
Alliance is a little too confining for you. 
  [Ambrosini] We underwent a conversion; we were won over to a 
softer [preceding word in English] language. We understood 
Fini's tactics--which have indeed been successful--but I cannot 
agree with the content of the new policy line. The values of the 
Social Movement have been betrayed. Fortunately, Gianfranco Fini 
has at least remembered to say that Mussolini was the greatest 
statesman of the century. It has all been heard before, however. 
I will not be able to reenter the party. 
  [Nava] But they had warned you. 
  [Ambrosini] To be sure. We had spoken with the provincial 
secretary on Friday evening, but my feelings got the better of 
me. I even went to the Blues Bar [preceding two words in 
English] (the meeting place of the Naziskins--CORRIERE DELLA 
SERA editor's note) which the autonomists have destroyed. I even 
received threatening phone calls and found my name on walls in 
Vicenza, but the autonomists remained unpunished. There had to 
be a response; we had to make our voice heard. Do we not live in 
a democracy?

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Solbes Denies `Formal Agreement' To </F>
Delay Single Currency, But Admits That There Have Been Talks"] 
  [Text] Economy Minister Pedro Solbes acknowledged 
yesterday that Felipe Gonzalez, Francois Mitterrand, and Helmut 
Kohl have held talks on the advisability of forgoing the 
European single currency in 1997, as EL PAIS reported Sunday [29 
May]. "The three men have been able to talk, analyze this 
situation, and take the view that it must be left until 1999," 
Solbes told the Servimedia agency. However, in Solbes' opinion, 
it is not a matter of a "formal agreement." "It is an exchange 
of views," he specified. German Finance Minister Theo Waigel was 
more laconic, but did not deny the talks' existence. Asked 
about this, he confined himself to stating: "I cannot confirm 
it." 
  The Spanish economy minister pointed out that it is 
"enormously complicated" for some countries to achieve the aims 
set in the Maastricht Treaty. "We will have to implement 
Maastricht in accordance with the circumstances," stated Solbes, 
in whose opinion the decision to undertake or delay monetary 
union will have to be taken in 1996. That year, "there will be 
a major political discussion on Europe's future," he said. 
  However, French President Francois Mitterrand and German 
head 
of government Helmut Kohl have assured Felipe Gonzalez that the 
European Union (EU) will not set the third stage of monetary 
union under way in 1997, as European officials connected with 
the Economic and Monetary Union [EMU] process confirmed to EL 
PAIS. 
  German Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who took part in a 
Franco-German summit in the French city of Mulhouse yesterday, 
displayed a more ambiguous stance on the talks between the three 
European leaders, according to REUTER. Asked about this by 
journalists attending the summit, Waigel did not deny the 
report, which was also carried by the German FRANKFURTER 
ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG newspaper, and simply stated: "I cannot 
confirm it." 
<H5>  Unlikely Date </H5>
  The Maastricht Treaty envisages that the third stage of EMU, 
which entails the adoption of the single currency, will begin in 
1997, provided that there is a minimum of seven countries that 
fulfill the convergence criteria required. Mitterrand and Kohl 
promised Gonzalez not to take this step, even if there were that 
minimum number of countries able to do so. 
  On the French side, Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery, who 
is also taking part in the Franco-German meeting in Mulhouse, 
asserted that he has no knowledge of any agreement between 
France, Germany, and Spain to delay the adoption of the single 
currency. 
  However, senior French officials made it clear that they 
regard the date of 1997 as unlikely for adopting the single 
currency, in view of many Community states' problems in reducing 
their public deficits. 
  Also during the meeting with Germany in Mulhouse, French 
Minister Alphandery rejected the conclusions on the future of 
the Community's labor market drawn up by a Franco-German 
committee of labor experts, in which they recommend extensive 
deregulation. Alphandery said that the text is provisional and 
does not commit the Paris and Bonn governments. 
  In addition, Secretary of State for Finance Enrique Martinez 
Robles stated yesterday that Spain will not need to make a 
budgetary adjustment this year in order to reduce the public 
deficit, unlike in the past few fiscal years. 
  Martinez Robles, who delivered a lecture on public finance 
in 
El Escorial, stated that the deficit performed better than 
forecast in the first four months of this year, and that it has 
fallen by almost 20 percent. In his opinion, the state budget 
for 1995 will maintain social expenditure and investment in 
infrastructures without increasing the tax burden.

<F P=106> ["M.G." report: "Eight F-18's From Zaragoza Seek </F>
Accommodation at Italy's Aviano Base"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The Air Force has chosen 31 Wing, based 
at Zaragoza, to take part in the mission to provide air support 
for the UN forces in Bosnia, under NATO control. This wing 
comprises two squadrons of fighter bombers and two of transport 
aircraft, from which will come the eight F-18's and two Hercules 
resupply aircraft which will take part in the operation. 
  Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas yesterday discussed 
with Defense Chief of Staff Lieutentant General Jose Rodrigo the 
details of the deployment, which will be approved within the 
next few days, once the outstanding problems have been resolved. 
One of them is identifying the base where the aircraft will be 
stationed. According to military sources, this will quite likely 
be that of Aviano in northern Italy, since eight U.S. F-18's are 
deployed there, and this would enable the Spanish fighters of 
the same model to share logistic support. 
  The Defense Ministry is also seeking to secure assurances 
that the Spanish unit's presence in the area will not be 
prolonged indefinitely, but will be on a rotating basis and will 
be limited to three months in principle. According to the Air 
Force plans, the contingent will comprise around 200 military 
personnel -- including pilots, mechanics, and support personnel 
-- commanded by a lieutenant colonel. The eight F-18's, six of 
which would operate simultaneously, will go with their crews, 
relieved each month, and with the commander of the squadron of 
origin in charge. 
<H5>  Repeated Request </H5>
  The aircraft will join the air operation deployed by NATO in 
Italian bases and aircraft carriers in the Adriatic, comprising 
100 aircraft from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, 
the Netherlands, and Turkey, under the command of the commander 
of the Fifth Tactical Air Force, based at Vicenza (Italy). 
Spain, which had hitherto refused to take part in the 
operation, reconsidered its refusal after NATO repeated its 
request a few days ago. 
  Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas said yesterday that 
the 
decision to send the aircraft will be taken "in the middle of 
this week, when some logistic problems have been resolved," EFE 
reports. "There are problems of maintenance and effectiveness 
which we must discuss" with the United States, he explained. 
  Garcia Vargas stated that the countries taking part in the 
operation "are at the limit of their means, especially as far as 
contributing crews is concerned. That is why we are discussing 
the possibility of our providing this relief for three months." 
He added that he informed the opposition last weekend, although 
"not all the groups as yet, because their leaders are engaged in 
an election campaign." United Left spokesman Antonio Romero, 
who was informed by the minister yesterday, declared himself 
opposed: "We do not agree with taking part in NATO actions, and 
still less with sending F-18 fighters which guarantee not 
peacekeeping but a military escalation."

<F P=106> [Report by V. Ruiz de Azua and L.R. Aizpeolea: "Aznar and </F>
Arzalluz Normalize Relations With Their Second Meeting in Two 
Months"] 
  [Text] The People's Party [PP] and the PNV [Basque 
Nationalist Party] are continuing with the normalization of 
their relations. Their two chairmen -- Jose Maria Aznar and 
Xabier Arzalluz -- held a meeting lasting almost two hours in 
Madrid yesterday, on the former's initiative. Aznar invited 
Arzalluz to his home and then accompanied him to a shopping mall 
so that his companion, nationalist leader Juan Maria Ollora, 
could buy a book on the fall of Mario Conde. According to 
sources in the two parties, the conversation was cordial, and 
occurred "irrespective" of the political differences. 
  The PNV does not share the PP's stance of censuring the 
government, while Aznar holds the PNV and its chairman jointly 
responsible for the impossibility of submitting a censure 
motion. However, the two leaders have held a meeting for the 
second time in two months, and, also for the second time, 
Arzalluz has stated that Aznar seems to him "a good person," and 
that he would trust him to conclude an agreement. The previous 
meeting took place secretly around Easter Week in Burgos, midway 
between Madrid and Bilbao. 
  On this occasion, however, Arzalluz agreed to visit Aznar in 
the morning in his office at PP headquarters, at 13 Genova 
Street in Madrid. When the date of the meeting became known the 
day before yesterday, the PP chairman offered him the 
possibility of going to his home to avoid being hounded by 
cameras. 
  The normalization of relations with the PP enables the PNV 
chairman to reaffirm his independence from the Socialists, with 
whom he is governing in a coalition in the Basque Country. It 
enables Aznar to show that, despite the disagreements, he is 
keeping channels of communication with other parliamentary 
parties open, and that the current disagreement does not mean 
isolation. 
  The conversation was attended by Basque PP Chairman Jaime 
Mayor Oreja and PNV leader Juan Maria Ollora. The two men, with 
other leaders of each party, will undertake to study over the 
next few weeks the PNV's autonomy proposals, which Arzalluz had 
already handed to his interlocutor in Burgos, contained in 
several documents. 
  Mayor Oreja stated in the afternoon that everything was 
discussed a little without prior order, without trying to seek 
any commitment or change of stance by either side. The PNV 
emphasized to the PP its intention to shun extremist stances 
with respect to the Socialist government, intimating that it 
will not take part in a destructive strategy or one of all-out 
resistance. 
  In this connection, Arzalluz asked Aznar to tone down the 
political strategy of tension maintained by the PP, using the 
corruption scandals. The PNV chairman told his host that the 
strategy that "seeks to erode leads to nothing good," according 
to nationalist sources. 
<H5>  Joint Study </H5>
  The PP and nationalist leaders took up again some of the 
matters that were discussed in the conversation held 29 March in 
Burgos. On that occasion, the possibility of setting up a kind 
of committee to study together the implementation of the Gernika 
Statute was raised. This idea of PP Deputy Secretary General 
Mariano Rajoy caught on at yesterday's meeting in producing a 
response from another of those attending the meeting -- Juan 
Maria Ollora. Both Mayor Oreja and Ollora will hold contacts 
and extend them successively with contributions from [Basque 
autonomous government] Councilor of the President's Office 
Joseba Zubia and Councilor of Finance Juan Luis Larrea -- both 
belonging to the PNV -- who are the negotiators on autonomy with 
the central administration. 
  The nationalists believe that this interchange is necessary 
in view of the uncertainty of the political scene that is 
developing not only in Spain but also in the Basque Country 
itself. Next fall's autonomous community elections leave the 
scene open, in the nationalists' opinion, and although the most 
likely outcome is that the current government coalition of 
Socialists and nationalists will continue, a result leading to a 
new government combination in which the PNV's new partner would 
be the PP is not ruled out. 
  But the central aim of the meeting -- arranged last week 
before Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra's appearance in the 
Congress [of Deputies] to answer questions on the Roldan affair 
-- was to relax relations between the two parties. "We are 
experiencing a time when we should all discuss everything, and 
not just in parliament," Arzalluz said yesterday, shortly before 
his meeting with Aznar. Later, nationalist sources close to the 
participants stated that the meeting was "cordial and relaxed." 
"Discussion between the leaders moderates language. The PNV is 
not at the eye of the PP's storm, nor is the PP at the eye of 
the PNV's storm. This meeting will help to calm the general 
political scene," the same sources said.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Antich: "Duran Lleida Asserts That CiU Is </F>
Tired of Receiving `Bad Checks'"] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- "Convergence and Union [CiU] is rather 
tired of paying cash down and receiving (from the government) 
bad drafts or checks. This is finished. Governability yes, but 
not at any price." With this emphatic remark, Democratic Union 
Steering Committee Chairman Josep Antoni Duran Lleida yesterday 
explained to several thousand of his party's supporters filling 
the Blaugrana Palace in Barcelona the Catalan nationalists' 
concern at the scant response, in his opinion, to the Catalan 
nationalists' autonomy demands. 
  The Catalan Christian Democrats yesterday tightened the 
screws on the Socialist government and placed autonomy matters 
to the fore in their demands for the next few months. Before an 
audience that during the two-day ninth UDC [Democratic Union of 
Catalonia] festival has helped make it clear that the veteran 
party is also a broadly based party -- over 14,000 people at a 
meal at the Barcelona Soccer Club premises yesterday, and tens 
of thousands during Saturday's [28 May] and Sunday's events -- 
Duran Lleida asserted that the CiU coalition will have to have 
more than one quid pro quo before continuing to support the PSOE 
[Spanish Socialist Workers Party]. 
<H5>  Discomfort </H5>
  "First deeds (namely, transfers of powers), then the 
confidence that they must earn day by day," he stated 
graphically. "Nobody can criticize us for demanding what, as 
Catalan nationalists, we are entitled to demand from the 
national viewpoint," he added. 
  The same idea was driven home by Jordi Pujol from Amposta in 
Tarragona. The Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] 
president, who was speaking for the first time in the European 
election campaign, pointed out that improving autonomy is not a 
secondary matter for the nationalists "but a priority, and 
Catalonia is entitled to achieve it." 
  But Duran Lleida did not content himself with airing what, 
in 
his opinion, are breaches of promises by the government. He 
also spoke of the discomfort that he has often felt when they 
have had to give the PSOE their support in votes in parliament. 
  "I also feel uncomfortable supporting the Socialist 
government -- the whole Union leadership feels uncomfortable -- 
but life is full of discomforts, and the important thing is that 
there is a government that is carrying out an economic policy 
and an autonomy policy," the Union top leader stated. 
  The Christian Democratic politician asserted that the 
nationalists would have given People's Party Chairman Jose Maria 
Aznar the same support that they have given Felipe Gonzalez, if 
the results of the 6 June general election had enabled him to 
govern. He harshly criticized the conservatives' and United 
Left's conduct as opposition parties, of whom he said that "they 
are interested not in Spain but in destroying the PSOE 
government and attaining power by whatever means." He 
criticized the People's Party for its policy on Catalonia, 
called them destabilizers, and accused them of "jeopardizing 
coexistence in Catalonia" by their attacks on the linguistic 
normalization policy. 
  However, he called on those present to distrust the 
"prudent" 
line practiced by the PSOE when referring to Catalonia, and 
asserted that it is simply electoral strategy. "In the case of 
the PSOE and the People's Party, it is all the same; when the 
PSOE did not need us, Alfonso Guerra also came to Barcelona and 
said things against Catalonia similar to those the People's 
Party is saying today," he asserted.

<F P=106> [Report by Sp. Sourmelidhis] </F>
  [Excerpts] At a time when Turkish Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller appears to be threatening Greece, Cypriot President 
Glavkos Kliridhis is ready to resign from his post as president 
of that republic to protest the secret negotiations between 
members of the UN Security Council and Turkish Cypriot leader 
Rauf Denktas' side and the negative decisions on a Cyprus 
solution being manipulated by the United Nations. 
  Yesterday proved clearly that Greek-Turkish relations mainly 
"pass through" Nicosia and depend on the solution of the Cyprus 
issue. 
  Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will meet his 
Turkish counterpart, Hikmet Cetin, today in Istanbul in a very 
bad climate that Ankara has created, aiming to get Greece 
involved in adventures and divert Athens from supporting the 
Cypriot leadership over the negative Security Council decisions. 
  Papoulias and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
will 
discuss the Cyprus issue and Greek-Turkish relations on the 
sidelines of the NATO foreign ministers' spring conference. 
  The United States is particularly disturbed and dissatisfied 
with President Kliridhis' reaction and is trying to avert such a 
possibility. The United States is aiming to find a way for a 
political dialogue between Greece and Turkey. At the same time, 
however, the Security Council's actions protect Denktas' and 
Ankara's intransigence. 
  A few days ago, Ciller sent U.S. President Bill Clinton 
another letter about the Cyprus issue. Kliridhis also sent a 
letter on the same issue. 
  U.S. Ambassador Thomas Niles yesterday had a surprise 
meeting 
with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and discussed 
Greek-Turkish relations and the Cyprus issue. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  The Cyprus Issue </H5>
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report on Cyprus 
essentially led the Cyprus issue into another deadlock. Of the 
five alternative solutions that Butrus-Ghali suggested, only one 
refers to Denktas' responsibility for the deadlock. 
  The United States, as well as Britain and France, chose the 
solution that will lead to new, quick negotiations--without 
blaming the Turkish Cypriots--and to a new, supplementary report 
by the UN secretary general, which, however, will not refer to 
the substance of the Cyprus issue. 
  When briefed by a U.S. diplomat, President Kliridhis reacted 
strongly to this development, saying that he is ready to quit. 
He also told the Cypriot people that they have been deceived by 
the allies and negotiators. Kliridhis was enraged when he 
learned that the United States wants to include in the 
supplementary report some of the measures it promised to Denktas 
and Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Tugay Ulucevik last month in 
Vienna. The Cypriot Government never learned officially about 
these promises. 
  President Kliridhis is waiting for Papandreou to extend an 
invitation to the Cypriot National Council to confer in Athens. 
He is also waiting for a final date to be set for his meeting 
with European Commission President Jacques Delors in Corfu 
before the EU summit. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today said 
that yesterday, President Glavkos Kliridhis sent personal 
letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime 
Minister John Major on the latest developments in the Cyprus 
issue and the continuing negotiations at the UN Security 
Council. Asked why the letters were sent to these two specific 
leaders, Kasoulidhis said the United States and Britain are the 
two powers that have recently moved toward the alternative of 
continuing the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. 
Kasoulidhis said: Kliridhis' letters aim to promote our side's 
positions. 
  Answering another question, the spokesman said Kliridhis' 
letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, which was conveyed by 
Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis during his visit in Moscow, 
had the same goal. The spokesman said meetings have been held 
on the same issue with France and China. 
  President Kliridhis and the foreign minister met the U.S. 
and 
British ambassadors in Nicosia.

  [Excerpts] The National Council today made specific 
decisions regarding future handling of the Cyprus issue. 
Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that in general, 
there was consensus and unanimity on almost all issues. He also 
said that the government will take the necessary measures to 
deal with the developments as they are outlined. There is no 
reason for concern, he said, and added that the Greek Cypriot 
side has not subsided and will deal with every possibility. It 
is possible, he said, that Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis 
will go to New York in the coming days. 
  Following today's National Council meeting, President 
Glavkos 
Kliridhis briefed Greek Ambassador Alexandros Sandhis on the 
decisions made in order for the latter to convey them to the 
Greek Government. 
  When they arrived at the presidential palace this morning, 
the political party leaders were asked to comment on reports 
that the UN secretary general will submit a supplementary report 
to the Security Council. Democratic Rally Chairman Ioannis 
Matsis said it appears that pressure continues on the UN 
secretary general, and some do not want to abandon the effort to 
lead us where we do not want to go. Socialist EDEK [United 
Democratic Union of Cyprus] Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis said that 
if the UN secretary general submits a supplementary report, it 
will mean that he has given in to pressure. Democratic Rally 
Chairman Spiros Kiprianou [title as heard] said that if reports 
are correct, it would be a new attempt to help out the Turkish 
side. AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] General 
Secretary Dhimitrios Khristofias said that he had no doubt that 
there was an attempt to keep the confidence-building measures on 
the negotiating table so that the two sides could meet each 
other at some point. He added that yesterday's decision by the 
National Council on the confidence-building measures was 
correct, and that the issue is now whether the Greek Cypriot 
side will remain firm in its decisions. [passage omitted] 
  Liberal Party President Nikolaos Rolandhis issued an open 
letter to President Kliridhis in which he expresses the view 
that the National Council has made a serious -- as he put it -- 
mistake in rushing with excessive speed to take a position on 
the UN secretary general's report before the Security Council's 
decision. Rolandhis also said that it was a mistake for the 
National Council to close the book on the confidence-building 
measures, and called on President Kliridhis not to reject a 
proposal for the return of part of Famagusta if Denktas accepts, 
even now, the 21 March document.

  [Text] Moscow (DPA) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's unexpected trip to Mainz for a medical 
examination nourished speculation in Moscow on 9 June that he 
might resign before long. Two leading Moscow newspapers, 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA and NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, citing 
unidentified circles, reported that Chernomyrdin was about to 
resign for health reasons. In that case, First Deputy Prime 
Minister Oleg Soskovets or former Russian Security Council 
Chairman Yuriy Skokov could succeed him. Chernomyrdin said in 
Germany, however, that he was in good health, and there were no 
indications that he might be weary of his position.

<F P=106> [Article by GATT Director General Peter Sutherland: "Spirit </F>
of New Trade Order"] 
  [Text] I doubt there were many FINANCIAL TIMES readers who 
failed to heave a hearty sigh of relief in April when ministers 
signed the Uruguay Round deal in Marrakesh. Relief, partly 
because most of them must have felt war-weary after eight years 
of reading about seemingly interminable negotiations and partly 
-- perhaps predominantly -- because they understood just how 
vital the deal really was. 
  The results of those negotiations will be implemented as 
from 
January 1995 when the World Trade Organisation [WTO] comes into 
being. One can only hope that the major players will not make 
the process of ratification -- which is required before we can 
finally confirm the implementation date -- into an agony of 
indecision and delay. The birth of the WTO should not be held 
hostage to domestic political in-fighting nor to transient trade 
squabbles, which tend to be of mind withering inconsequence when 
measured against the crucial importance of the new multilateral 
trading system. 
  But even when the WTO is in place there will be a 
temptation, 
in some capitals at least, to revert to "business as usual"; 
perpetuating the same kind of preoccupations, justified or not, 
with respect to bilateral trade balances alleged "unfairness" in 
trading practices and so on. It is important that we recognise 
that the WTO is a response to continuing global changes, 
economic and otherwise, and that, as a consequence, its 
activities have to be seen against a background of much more 
than big power trade politics. 
  It will be a truly multilateral institution seeking 
multilateral responses to the economic problems faced by a large 
continuum of countries. This is not to talk of "world 
government"; it is simply to face up to the inter-linkages 
between economies. It is also to reassert the spirit of the 
Uruguay Round in finding meaningful, practicable approaches, 
acceptable to all, which drive forward the creation of wealth 
and sustainable development. 
  Establishment of the WTO does, though, call for a new 
commitment to co-ordination in economic policymaking. Why? 
Think for a moment about one key preoccupation of most 
governments at present: education and training in the context of 
unemployment. 
  There is a convincing argument that expanded trade between 
the developed and developing worlds has, in the past few decades 
and particularly since the mid-1980s, led to significant 
employment shifts in both. And it is not a simple matter of 
jobs lost and gained. While the extent of jobs lost in certain 
industries and gained in others in the developed countries can 
be debated, it seems clear that trade with the developing 
countries has tended to favour the skilled against the unskilled 
and exacerbated the gap between them. At the same time, in 
developing countries, export-oriented policies have encouraged a 
faster rate of learning and investment in education. This has 
opened up a gap between those with little or no education, who 
are unlikely to be involved in anything but the most rudimentary 
manufacturing activity, and those with at least a basic level of 
education. 
  This is an important observation. The results of the Uruguay 
Round, and particularly those related to increased market access 
for goods and services, are designed to expand trade; certainly 
between developed and developing countries and those countries 
in the process of economic reform. Thus the impact of recent 
trade growth on skill demands and on the gap between skilled and 
unskilled, educated and uneducated may be reinforced and, 
perhaps, accelerated over several decades. 
  Nor is it just concessions on market access which will spur 
demands on education and training. New opportunities will be 
opened up through the intellectual property agreement -- 
encouraging technology transfer, for instance -- and the 
services deal will lead to the establishment of foreign service 
providers requiring skilled, educated employees. And this 
should not be seen as a one-way process; opportunities for the 
development of new skills will be as great in industrialised as 
in developing countries. 
  The real question that arises is whether we are thinking 
hard 
enough about the machinery which will help governments identify 
and respond to such trends. 
  After all, it is evident that the most important influences 
on national economies are now, and will be increasingly, outside 
their borders. As a consequence, most governments will be left 
with few policy instruments with which to attempt to affect the 
performance of their own economies. If that is the case then it 
is vital that the international machinery be effective. 
  I have argued previously that the present machinery of the 
G7 
is now inadequate. On almost every measure, it is an 
unrepresentative organism and, consequently, its deliberations 
seldom have meaning or relevance for countries outside the 
select group -- not always, indeed, for those inside. That is a 
big loss. The fact is that the G7 countries must recognise that 
they cannot take sole responsibility for the broad thrust of 
economic management without adequate participation of the 
countries representing new dynamic markets in the developing 
world. There is a need for a grouping of countries that can be 
more effective and representative with some participation, 
perhaps, on a rotating basis. 
  But the key to making such a group effective is not only 
representation but the input participants receive. Here, the 
multilateral institutions must now get their act together. 
  At present we have a multitude of researchers and analysts 
in 
a multitude of organisations producing countless papers and 
reports to be added to those produced by governments themselves. 
Why should the organisations concerned with money, finance and 
trade -- the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the 
WTO -- not evolve a single coherent statement on issues of 
economic concern to a representative forum of the world's 
leaders? And in order to ensure implementation of the decisions 
reached, the same organisations should co-ordinate more 
effectively to give strong institutional support. 
  One thing is for sure. We must concentrate on the long-term 
implications of the agreements which have been reached and must 
be implemented by the WTO and on the way in which this new 
multilateral trading system will spur new approaches to global 
economic management.

  [Text] The North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC] 
foreign ministers conference has ended in Istanbul. A joint 
communique has been issued that mainly discusses the regional 
conflicts in the former Soviet Union, disarmament, and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Sources close to the conference have said that no 
concessions 
were made to Russia's objections concerning the Azeri-Armenian 
conflict and the reduction of Conventional Forces in Europe 
[CFE]. 
  The statement supports the idea of holding a conference 
within the framework of the CSCE to reach a lasting and just 
solution to the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. The statement 
says that the problem can be resolved only through negotiations. 
  The statement points out that the NACC follows developments 
in the Crimean Autonomous Republic with concern. It adds that 
the problem should be resolved within the framework of the 
territorial integrity of the Ukraine. 
  The statement discusses the Russian military presence in the 
Baltic countries without using the word Russia. It says that 
the withdrawal of foreign troops from these areas as soon as 
possible will contribute positively to the security of both the 
regional countries and Europe. 
  On Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement says that a political 
solution should be reached as soon as possible. 
  On arms control and disarmament, the statement stresses the 
importance of fully implementing all the existing agreements on 
the issue. The statement stresses the need to fully implement 
within this framework the CFE, the agreement to prevent the 
proliferation of nuclear arms, and the agreements on chemical 
and biological weapons, as well as poisonous gases. 
  The statement says that an agreement must be concluded as 
soon as possible that completely bans nuclear experiments. 
  NATO Acting Secretary General Sergio Balanzino held a news 
conference at the end of the meeting where he said that Russia 
accepted the Partnership for Peace plan as it is, but that it 
requested a [word indistinct] on how the plan will work. 
  Balanzino stressed that it was very important for all the 
members to reach an agreement. If that had not been achieved, 
he said, we would have given a negative message to the world. 
  Replying to questions, Balanzino said that Russia is a very 
important force in Europe and NATO's close relations with this 
force will contribute to world peace. 
  Asked if Kozyrev's objections to the joint statement are a 
negative sign that Russia might change its policies in the 
future, Balanzino said: I do not know the answer to that 
question. I do not know about the future. However, today, 
there is no change of policy. Maybe Kozyrev lacked sleep, maybe 
he was tired.

  [Text] The foreign ministers of the North Atlantic 
Coordination Council countries held a meeting in Istanbul 
yesterday. A delegation from our country, presided over by 
Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi, participated in this meeting. 
  In a speech he gave at this meeting, Mr. Serreqi stressed 
among other things that Albania assesses that the Partnership 
for Peace [PFP] initiative marks a new qualitative step in the 
direction of setting up trust, security, and practical 
cooperation with NATO and its member countries, as well as other 
East European countries. Albania has supported the PFP idea 
since the very beginning. Albania's signing of a (?framework) 
document at the highest level clearly speaks for the vital 
interest in actively taking part in this process, in the service 
of peacekeeping and peacemaking. 
  Mr. Serreqi said that through active participation in a 
partnership, we aim at closer, more qualitative, and concrete 
cooperation with the NATO, which will pave the way for our 
country's future membership in this vital political and military 
collective security organization. 
  He talked about the democratic reform that is being carried 
out successfully in the Army. He said that we have implemented 
the organization of the Army and ensured transparency in the 
questions of planning the defense and military budget. We are 
confident, he said, that cooperation within the PFP framework 
will play a decisive role in further advancing this reform and 
modernizing the Armed Forces, thus aiming at coming ever closer 
to reaching NATO standards. 
  During his stay, Mr. Serreqi held several private meetings 
with the foreign ministers of NATO countries such as U.S. 
Secretary of State Christopher, German Foreign Minister Kinkel, 
the foreign ministers of Turkey, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, 
Denmark, etc. 
  In these meetings, they discussed aspects of bilateral 
relations as well as the relations of our country with NATO and 
the European Union [EU]. The situation in the region occupied a 
special place in these meetings, particularly the recent 
developments in Greek-Albanian relations, at a time when Greece 
alone continues to block, in the EU Council of Ministers and 
Finance and Economy, the granting of a consensus for aid 
amounting to ECU35 million toward the balance of payments in 
Albania. 
  During the reception hosted for the delegation heads, Mr. 
Serreqi met with Turkish Prime Minister Ciller. She reconfirmed 
her desire to visit Albania soon. 
  During the meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Cetin, Mr. 
Serreqi talked about bilateral relations in the framework of the 
opportunities opened up by the visit to Turkey of President 
Berisha, both at the political and economic level. 
  During the break between sessions, with the initiative of 
the 
Greek delegation, Mr. Serreqi talked with Greek Foreign Minister 
Papoulias. Mr. Serreqi stressed that since the meeting in 
Zurich, and after the acceptance of a second meeting by the 
Greeks, there has been no incident that would make the 
development of dialogue difficult. At this time, the resurgence 
of an anti-Albanian campaign and propagation of absurd claims 
about arrests and repression among the Greek minority, in order 
to justify the cancellation of the meeting of foreign ministers 
and hinder Albania's relations with the EU, is inconceivable. 
  For his part, Mr. Papoulias said he was in favor of lowering 
tones and creating a climate enabling the resumption of dialogue. 
  Mr. Serreqi held a very important meeting with his Italian 
counterpart Maroni. After becoming acquainted with the 
situation in Albania, Mr. Maroni expressed his admiration for 
the results of reform in our country. He said that Albania 
represents a special case in Central and East Europe and is 
characterized by political stability and economic achievements. 
He said that the Italian Government acknowledges Albania's 
great contribution and role toward stability in the Balkans. 
  Mr. Serreqi stated that the Albanian Government does not see 
relations with Italy as a neighbor on a bilateral level alone, 
but as involving priority relations that are being developed 
with a friendly country that plays an important role not only in 
the EU and NATO, but also in other international entities. Thus 
Albanian-Italian relations assume a multilateral dimension. 
  Minister Maroni confirmed to Mr. Serreqi the desire of the 
new Italian Government to further develop relations between 
Italy and our country. 
  They also talked about the practical implementation of 
existing projects, as well as future plans. Mr. Maroni said 
that Italy will be more engaged in strengthening Albania's 
relations with NATO and the European Union. Minister Serreqi 
invited his Italian counterpart for a visit to Albania. The 
date of the visit will be determined through diplomatic channels.

<F P=106> [By Wolfgang Schweitzer] </F>
  [Excerpts] Vienna, June 10 (AFP) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency voted Friday [10 June] to suspend technical 
assistance to North Korea amid growing outrage at the Stalinist 
regime's refusal to allow access to suspected nuclear 
installations. 
  The suspension constitutes one of the toughest forms of 
sanction the world nuclear watchdog can take against a member 
state. 
  The 35-member IAEA board of governors took the decision by 
28 
votes to one with four abstensions, amid Pyongyang's continued 
refusal to allow full inspection of nuclear sites suspected of 
producing material for nuclear arms. [passage omitted] 
  In the IAEA vote, Libya voted against, while China, India, 
Syria and Lebanon abstained. Cuba and Saudi Arabia did not take 
part. 
  The decision by the board of governors provides "in 
conformity with the provisions of...the (IAEA) Statute, to 
suspend non-medical Agency assistance to the DPRK (North 
Korea)." [passage omitted] 
  The IAEA noted in its resolution "with deep regret" that the 
"limited opportunity...to select, segregate, and secure fuel 
rods from the DPRK's five-megawatt reactor for later 
measurements in accordance with Agency standards" had been lost. 
The Agency also regretted it was no longer possible to 
ascertain whether nuclear material had been diverted from the 
reactor. 
  The Agency added it "deplores the DPRK's failure to 
implement 
essential elements of resolutions of the Board (of Governors)" 
and called on Pyongyang to cooperate fully and provide access 
"to all safeguards-relevant information and locations." 
  The IAEA governors strongly commended the "tireless efforts" 
of its Director General Hans Blix and the IAEA secretariat to 
obtain North Korea's cooperation in implementing safeguards 
agreements, calling on them to continue their work.

  [Text] Vienna, June 10 KYODO -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) overwhelmingly adopted a resolution on 
Friday [10 June] suspending technical aid to North Korea for its 
refusal to allow full inspections of its nuclear facilities 
suspected of developing nuclear weapons. 
  The action represented the first punitive step by the UN 
nuclear watchdog agency against North Korea, which promptly said 
that it will order two IAEA inspectors still in the country to 
leave the country. 
  The IAEA's technical aid to North Korea amounted to 270,000 
dollars in 1993. 
  The IAEA board of governors voted 28-1 for the resolution 
cosponsored by the United States, Japan and other countries, 
which have expressed grave concern over Pyongyang's clandestine 
nuclear program as a destabilizing factor on the north Asian 
security scene. 
  Libya was the sole dissenting country. China, North Korea's 
longtime ally, abstained, along with three other countries. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told reporters in 
Istanbul that their countries will push for an international 
conference on North Korea and a resolution of sanctions by the 
UN Security Council against North Korea. 
  Moscow has proposed an international conference on North 
Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program to help defuse tensions 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  After the IAEA's historic vote, a North Korean diplomat in 
Vienna said his country no longer guarantees the continuity of 
nuclear safeguards.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Austria Gives Overwhelming Yes to </F>
EU"] 
  [Text] With 66.4 percent voting in favor, Sunday's [12 
June] European Union [EU] referendum outcome was a clear 
expression of support for Austria's admission to the EU. The 
81.3-percent election turnout was unexpectedly high. 
  Austria will belong to the EU as of 1995. The referendum, 
which was necessary in view of the "overall change" to the 
Constitution that admission would entail, saw 66.4 percent vote 
in favor of membership of the EU and only 33.6 percent against. 
In absolute terms, there were 3,095,260 votes for and 1,566,799 
votes against. 
  With this green light given by the Austrian population and 
the yes given by the European Parliament on 5 May, there are 
only mini-hurdles now in the way of membership: The national 
parliaments of the "original EU" countries must now give their 
blessing to the applicants. However, this will hardly impact on 
the 1 January admission date. 
  Speaking to DIE PRESSE, President Klestil described the 
result as a "victory for all Austrian patriots." Now, future 
European policy will also have to be conducted on the basis of 
consensus. The president did not conceal the fact that he also 
respected those who voted no -- "because they went and voted." 
In addition, he said: "What I said before the referendum -- 
namely, that it has nothing to do with politicians or parties, 
let alone warnings -- also applies today." Visibly moved, the 
politician who has already been described as the "father of EU 
admission," Foreign Minister Mock, spoke of an "overwhelming 
success." Beaming, he said that "the Austrians have shown that 
they are much better than they themselves believe." 
  At a joint news conference later in the evening, Chancellor 
Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor Busek both stressed that they are 
in any event thinking about continuing with the coalition after 
the October elections for "European reasons." 
  The results in the laender were between 56.4 percent in 
favor 
in Tyrol and 74.6 percent in favor in Burgenland. The vote in 
Vienna was 65.8 percent in favor. 
  The first exit polls, but also information about trends in 
last week's opinion polls, made it possible to conclude that the 
content and form of the rhetoric used by opponents also boosted 
support for admission. Above all it led to an increase in the 
turnout which overwhelmingly benefited the number of "yes" votes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Almost Two-Thirds in Favor of </F>
Accession: `Gate to Larger Europe Open'"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Federal President Thomas 
Klestil was not only happy about the effect of the appeals to 
participate in the referendum but also about the result: 
"Austria has passed its European test -- the gate to a larger 
Europe is now open." The result of the referendum is "important 
for the country and good for Europe." 
  Klestil strongly appealed to all parties to "accept the 
decision of the voters in a democratic spirit, to close ranks, 
and to tackle together the major challenges the country now 
faces." It is one of the most important rules of democracy not 
to the day after the election tense with the confrontations of 
before. 
  In their news conference, neither Federal Chancellor Franz 
Vranitzky nor Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek displayed "any 
inclination for experimentation." Both stated that cooperation 
at the level of government with those parties that have taken a 
negative position toward EU [Eureopean Union] entry was "not 
possible" in the coming legislative term, either. Vranitzky 
said that the election campaign would be used to create 
"fundamental trust in our party among the people." "In the 
interest of Euorpean integration," the government parties showed 
"self-evident solidarity." 
  Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek said that the Austrian People's 
Party [OeVP] would "continue the path on which it had embarked." 
[passage omitted] 
  "The Austrians opted for the future and for optimism." This 
is how Foreign Minister Alois Mock commented on the result of 
the referendum. "Once more, the Austrians showed that they are 
better than they themselves think of themselves. The Austrians 
definitely wanted to have a say when it comes to building a new 
Europe, and not remain outside." 
  Heide Schmidt, chairwoman of the Liberal Forum, spoke of a 
decision for openness. As an opposition party, it was not easy 
for the Liberal Forum to support the government line. The "Yes 
to the EU" was, nevertheless, the right decision, because this 
was proof of a responsible opposition policy. 
  On behalf of the Greens, Peter Pilz announced that "as of 
tomorrow, the Austrian Greens" would "keep an eye on Brussels 
and Strasbourg," -- because now Austria would need somebody to 
carefully watch that the transit treaty will still exist in six 
years. [passage omitted] 
  In a reaction late last night, [Freedom Party of Austria 
Chairman Joerg] Haider said "I am neither the winner nor the 
loser," and announced that the government would "not be happy 
for too long about its undoubtedly high level of support." The 
mists would rise, and then those "conditions" of which he warned 
would come into play. 
  In view of the enormous propaganda, the 66-percent support 
was "actually a poor result," Haider said in his analysis of the 
result, in which he described entry opponents as "patriots" and 
supporters as "European-minded Austrians" who "obviously" do not 
"attach great importance" to democratic structures.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Charles </F>
Lambroschini; place and date not given: "Austrians Will Say Yes 
to Europe" -- first paragraph is LE FIGARO introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Banker by profession but socialist by 
conviction, Franz Vranitzky has been chancellor since 1986. He 
governed initially in coalition with the small Freedom Party, 
but was was quick to dissolve this when his partner made 
far-right nationalist Joerg Haider as its leader. Since then, 
Vranitzky's Social Democrats have formed a grand coalition 
government with the conservative Austrian People's Party. Born 
in 1937, Franz Vranitzky earned a doctor of economics. In his 
youth he was a member of the national basketball team. He is 
married, with a son and a daughter. 
  [Lambroschini] The latest polls foretell a "yes" in the 
referendum. But a close one. There is reason for concern when 
we reflect back on the referendum on nuclear power which ended, 
in November 1978, with Chancellor Kreisky's resignation. At the 
time, 31 percent of the no vote three prior to the vote changed 
to a 51 percent on voting day. What is your prediction this 
time? 
  [Vranitzky] I believe that Austrians will say "yes" to 
Europe, but I also believe that the outcome will be very close. 
There are several reasons for this reticence. The euphoria we 
experienced following the outcome of the successful negotiations 
with Brussels could not last. Those who opposed Austria's 
joining Europe thought that the discussions with Brussels would 
never end. For this reason they concentrated their fire on the 
negotiations, rather than immediately attacking the referendum. 
Now that they have adjusted their focus, they are gaining 
points, because the campaign is emotional, whereas, by the 
nature of things, the government's arguments are founded on 
reason. It is always easy to play on people's fears by 
predicting the worst. Finally do not forget that, economically, 
1993 was a very bad year. In Austria, as in the rest of Europe, 
many people therefore reacted as if the economic recession was 
the result of European integration. Despite this, I firmly hope 
that the parallel between this referendum and Kreisky's will 
remain a false one. [passage omitted] 
  [Lambroschini] Austria already enjoys all the trade 
advantages which the European Union [EU] can offer, with the 
Economic Economic Area between the European Free Trade 
Association [EFTA], of which you are part, and the Europe of the 
Twelve. Is not the real reason for your application for 
membership a political one? Is not Austria, which was occupied 
for 10 years by the Red Army, seeking for protection against 
Russia? Is not Austria, which has particularly unstable 
neighbors, looking to sign an insurance contract against the 
risk of another Yugoslav conflict spilling over its borders? 
  [Vranitzky] I never said that our application could be 
explained simply by economic reasons. If that were the case, we 
could be satisfied with out participation in EFTA. I have 
always thought that European integration should be a political 
project. Europe has much more important tasks to accomplish than 
the simple exchange of goods. Whether we are talking about 
monetary union or the continent's security, the solution can 
come only from a shared political will. To confront, as you 
say, the risks of destabilization in East Europe, we need a 
political decisionmaking power. 
  [Lambroschini] Do you really believe that if Europe had had 
a 
common foreign policy four or five years ago, the war in 
Yugoslavia could have been prevented? Do you not rather think 
that the failure was due to the refusal of the major European 
countries -- France, Germany, Great Britain -- to accept their 
responsibility and carry their partners with them? 
  [Vranitzky] We will always come back to the need for common 
action. Today, in Yugoslavia, there are not just French and 
British troops. There are also Belgians, Spaniards, and Danes. 
Even if France and Germany have given the kick-off, the game 
cannot be limited to these two players. 
  [Lambroschini] You therefore reject the view of the 
British, who had hoped that the arrival of four EFTA members 
would have the effect of weakening the camp of the partisans of 
a political Europe. 
  [Vranitzky] I place myself among the proponents of political 
union. 
  [Lambroschini] In joining Europe, will Austria renounce its 
faith in the "state as provider of all?" Will you accept the 
idea that combating unemployment requires you to abandon certain 
social benefits, when confronted with international competition, 
which makes labor costs too high? 
  [Vranitzky] Rather the opposite. For Austria, joining Europe 
means both promoting its economic expansion and strengthening 
its social welfare system. In order to meet the competition 
from countries whose social welfare is not as good as ours, my 
social-democratic convictions forbid me to call into question 
our concept of social progress. We must meet this competition 
by improving the training of our workers, by investing in 
research, by getting out of less well-performing economic areas 
in order to concentrate on leading-edge technology. 
  [Lambroschini] Hardly will Austria have joined the Twelve 
then it will have to participate in the debate on the reform of 
the European institutions scheduled to take place in 1996. For 
you, what needs to be changed to enable the Europe of Sixteen to 
find again the effectiveness which was already seriously 
compromised in the Europe of the Twelve? 
  [Vranitzky] For me, the 1996 intergovernmental conference 
will represent that next step in the process of defining the 
objectives of European integration. First of all we will have 
to work to eliminate the so-called democratic deficit. In other 
words, improving the relationships between European Parliament, 
the Council of Ministers, and the Commission. Second, we will 
have to discuss common foreign policy and common security 
policy. When, in the referendum campaign, people ask me: "But 
why are you in such a hurry to join the EU?," the reply is 
obvious. We need to act quickly because we are determined to 
take part in the 1996 debate. 
  [Lambroschini] But given the differences in the approaches 
of 
the Twelve and in their very different economic situations, do 
you not think that a two-speed Europe is inevitable? 
  [Vranitzky] I am absolutely against a two-speed Europe. Such 
an approach would strike against the very idea of a united 
Europe because it would provide an all too easy excuse to those 
who do not want to accept the reforms. 
  [Lambroschini] In France, many people are afraid at the idea 
that Austria's membership will strengthen the German bloc. 
Certain of them are even talking of a new annexation. Without 
going that far, shortly before the fall of the Berlin wall, 
Francois Mitterrand had welcomed you at the Elysee [office of 
the president] with the rather ambiguous words: "Austria, the 
third German state, is welcome in the European Community." 
  [Vranitzky] Let us be clear. Austria is not a German state. 
Austria is only an Austrian state. That is what I told Francois 
Mitterrand, adding: "We do not see ourselves as members of a 
German bloc." To which President Mitterrand replied: "All 
right, we understand you. We will not insist." A second 
comment: Comparing Austria's entry into the EU to annexation by 
Hitler is to have really totally forgotten the terror involved. 
  [Lambroschini] Economic relations between Austria and 
Germany 
are already very extensive. When you join the EU, what will win 
the day, the intensification of your relations with Germany, or 
diversification? 
  [Vranitzky] Diversification will win the day. But remaining 
outside the EU would, on the contrary, lead to an 
intensification of relations with our largest partners. 
  [Lambroschini] Once Austria has entered the Union, what will 
remain of its neutrality? 
  [Vranitzky] For Austrians, neutrality means that they refuse 
to take part in a war. But I believe that we need to work 
together to set up a system permitting joint action against 
those who violate peace. Joining the EU does not therefore 
impair our neutrality. 
  [Lambroschini] But if a common European security system 
leads 
to a common war, how will you be able to preserve your 
neutrality? 
  [Vranitzky] Under the UN collective security system, as 
provided for by the UN Charter, we have already taken part in 
joint actions, without in this way violating our neutrality. 
Hence, during the Gulf War, we allowed arms to pass through 
Austrian territory and Austrian air space. We would certainly 
not have permitted this in the case of a bilateral conflict. 
  [Lambroschini] Other neutral countries, Sweden and Finland, 
have applied to enter the EU and are interested in NATO's offer 
of a Partnership for Peace. What about Austria? 
  [Vranitzky] Long before NATO dreamed up this Partnership for 
Peace, Austria had worked on developing its relations in the 
military area with the East European countries. With a view to 
peacekeeping operations, we wished to assist them with their 
training programs. The fact is that the development of 
relations with the former Warsaw Pact countries is the main 
objective of the Partnership for Peace. We have told NATO that, 
for the time being, Austria will concentrate its efforts on its 
entry into the EU but that, once it has achieved this goal, we 
will examine this Partnership for Peace very closely. That 
being said, it is clear that, for Sweden and Finland, their 
potential membership in this system will not call their doctrine 
into question. These two countries remain firm in their refusal 
to take part in military alliances. 
  [Lambroschini] Austria will therefore continue to refuse to 
join NATO? 
  [Vranitzky] Precisely. 
  [Lambroschini] Your insistence on demanding the accelerated 
integration of the new Central European democracies is another 
subject which separates you from most of the Twelve. Here you 
opposed Margaret Thatcher when she explained to you that the 
Twelve would commit themselves to advanced cooperation with East 
Europe only when it had built up a market economy. 
  [Vranitzky] My analysis, indeed, is the opposite of that of 
the former British prime minister. I do not believe that these 
countries will be able to establishing market economies without 
first gaining the cooperation of West Europe. The Sixteen will 
have to increase their cooperation with East Europe, and will 
have to do so in a coordinated way. This is, moreover, a 
further reason for insisting on the EU's political vocation. 
Given the risks of destabilization in East Europe, limiting 
European integration to the members of the EU and EFTA is not 
enough. East Europe must be included in the integration process. 
  [Lambroschini] When do you believe that this enlargement of 
the Union to include the East European countries will be 
possible? 
  [Vranitzky] Perhaps by the end of the century. 
  [Lambroschini] And Russia? 
  [Vranitzky] First of all we need to concentrate on the 
countries nearest to our borders. But later, in one way or 
another, Russia too will have to be associated with this process 
of European integration. 
  [Lambroschini] Are you not concerned to see former 
communists 
return to power in neighboring Poland and Hungary, and to 
observe that they are the second largest political force in the 
Czech Republic? 
  [Vranitzky] I have studied closely the programs of the 
parties and the men who represent this new socialist or 
social-democratic approach. I believe that most of them are 
very clearly different from the communist movements of the past. 
They have proved their desire to continue in the path of the 
market economy. 
  [Lambroschini] And what is your analysis of the return of 
another ancient peril, that of fascism, in Italy, another of 
your neighbors? 
  [Vranitzky] Like a lot of people, I believed that what is 
happening today in Italy could never happen again. The most 
serious problem is that, unlike the new socialists in East 
Europe, who have abandoned Stalin and Lenin, Italy's neofascists 
continue to refer to the past, to Mussolini and his regime. But 
we shall see what the Berlusconi government is going to do to 
come up with convincing solutions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt by </F>
Benedicte Vaes; place and date not given: "Flexibility: 
Maystadt Plays It Down"] 
  [Text] The OECD is prescribing massive doses of flexibility 
to its member countries, which are suffering from unemployment 
that is burdening 35 million of its citizens. It says the root 
of all the evil is the "inability of our countries to adapt to 
change." It is advising its member countries to examine 
critically all their social protection measures in order to 
assess the extent to which such measures destroy jobs. 
  Yesterday in Paris, Philippe Maystadt participated in the 
33d 
ministerial session. We asked him if he supports the OECD 
directives. 
  [Maystadt] This report, while stimulating and realistic, 
opens the way to discussion. It rejects simplistic approaches 
and launches a warning about the impasse of protectionism. 
Nevertheless, like some of my colleagues, I would tone it down. 
I do not agree with the conclusion. While flexibility in the 
labor market is essential, it is not a panacea for all our 
unemployment ills. 
  [Vaes] Is more flexibility needed? 
  [Maystadt] I am in favor of strategies to reorganize working 
time. They should be decided on a decentralized basis, such as 
corporate plans. 
  [Vaes] The results are not really convincing. 
  [Maystadt] We have to assess them and perhaps find more 
motivating incentives. 
  [Vaes] The OECD questions the usefulness of minimum wages. 
Do you agree with this? 
  [Maystadt] The OECD is not that categorical. It said that 
the role of legal minimum wages must be reassessed. In those 
places where it is felt necessary to maintain them as a strategy 
in combating unemployment, this is the case for our country, it 
advises minimizing their negative impact on employment. 
  [Vaes] Meaning? 
  [Maystadt] They should be indexed according to prices rather 
than earnings: We are already doing this. In addition, these 
wages should be modulated depending on age and on the 
productivity of the regions. This latter point is not aimed at 
the regions of Belgium: Our regions have identical productivity. 
It remains to be seen if we are sufficiently modifying the 
minimum wage in accordance with age. We have already 
established "springboard jobs," which are paid at a rate of 90 
percent. Perhaps more should be done. 
  [Vaes] If there is not enough flexibility, what other 
solutions are there? 
  [Maystadt] I am advocating two ideas. They are recommended 
by the White Paper, but certain people tend to forget about them 
due to a selective reading of the paper. We must exploit the 
pools of jobs represented by local community services in the 
face of growing social demand due mainly to an aging population. 
I propose taking action on the supply side by further reducing 
the cost of unskilled labor. I also propose taking action on 
the demand side by creating the "service checks" mentioned in 
the white paper, a move which should lead to real jobs. 
  In addition, to alleviate the indirect cost of labor, new 
revenue has to be found through environmental taxes and taxes on 
income from investments. The Austerity Plan is already geared 
to this approach. A harmonized European approach would allow us 
to go further. 
  [Vaes] The OECD wants to limit the payment of unemployment 
incentives, which, it says, "removes the incentive" to look for 
work. Do you agree? 
  [Maystadt] That is the most debatable part of the report. I 
would challenge the cliche that says the right to unemployment 
benefits is unlimited in Belgium. Abnormally long periods of 
unemployment lead to exclusion. 
  [Vaes] You support the inclusion of a social clause in trade 
agreements. Will this ever happen? 
  [Maystadt] I reject disguised protectionism, but I feel it 
is 
legitimate to make access to trade liberalization conditional 
upon the respect of the basic rights of workers. This approach 
is acceptable to the developing countries. We must ban child 
labor and help the targeted countries develop education systems. 
To make this kind of system succeed, I am endeavoring, as 
chairman of the IMF interim committee, and with the agreement of 
Michel Hansenne, BIT [International Labor Office] director 
general, to link the IMF, the World Bank, and the International 
Labor Organization.

<F P=106> [Article by Edouard van Velthem: "Clinton Spurs Europe"] </F>
  [Text] Has Washington decided to change its Balkan strategy 
for the fourth time in four years? Officially, nothing has 
changed: Support for the European plan, without forcing the 
Muslims to accept a "shameful peace." However, there are a 
number of signals in the background to suggest that President 
Clinton has been convinced of the urgent need to find a 
political solution. 
  At a meeting in Istanbul with his Atlantic alliance 
colleagues, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe was able to 
stress his satisfaction that "the United States has, for the 
first time, shown a very strong commitment to quickly arrive at 
a negotiated settlement." London is also said to hold this 
view, which would appear to have taken hold during Bill 
Clinton's recent visit to the Elysee [the French president's 
residence]. Reports from the French and American sides are 
consistent in underlining that, on this occasion, Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher, who favors a heavy-handed approach 
toward the Serbs, wisely chose to remain silent as President 
Clinton agreed with Francois Mitterrand on the need to impose 
the partition plan and that any lifting of the arms embargo 
would risk extending the conflict. 
  An American colleague told us yesterday: "This is a subject 
of great controversy in Washington, not just between the 
Pentagon and the State Department, which is nothing new, but 
also in Congress, where the `lobbying war' is currently raging 
with reports of `ethnic cleansing,' and counterreports on `the 
rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the region.'" In fact, in 
recent weeks THE NEW YORK TIMES and THE WASHINGTON POST, while 
coming down hard on Serbian aggression, have been reporting on 
arms from Iran and the dispatch of new contingents of mujahidin 
to fight alongside the Muslims." 
  As a result, the word sanctions has been revived to threaten 
negotiators blocking the path to peace. The Sword of Damocles 
certainly hit the mark when Germany hung it over Croatia, 
forcing Zagreb into a reconciliation with Sarajevo. THE NEW 
YORK TIMES, however, this time envisages a kind of reverse 
pressure, whereby the possibility of lifting an arms embargo on 
Belgrade would pressure the Muslims into accepting a compromise. 
  In official Yugoslav circles, too, people are more or less 
convinced that "positive signals are, for the time being, being 
sent to the federal authorities." These include, according to a 
Serbian diplomat, "a degree of flexibility in applying 
sanctions. Import and export operations have become somewhat 
easier and we have even been able to ship 200 tonnes of raisins 
to, of all people, the Germans." 
  The coming week should be very informative. The 
Russian-American-European "contact group" without the 
belligerents will pore over new maps for the partitioning of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The aim is to reconcile the "51/49" project 
with the territorial demands of Sarajevo. They may well map out 
"gray zones" based on the Unpas model for Krajina, in other 
words, regions that fall directly under UN control. 
  Will there be a return to the reality of the French and 
British standpoints when the interludes of American air strikes 
and Russian deployment have been forgotten? It is not a 
glorious solution for the international community, nor an 
exultant situation for Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it may also be 
the birth of common sense....

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jacques Santer by Jean de la </F>
Gueriviere; place and date not given: "Each Country Must Be 
Able To Add Its Ingredient to the Union"] 
  [Text] [Gueriviere] You are putting yourself before the 
voters after 10 years of a coalition government with the 
Socialists. What lessons have you learned from this alliance, 
and how do you differentiate yourself from your partners? 
  [Santer] Since 1984, we have been committed to a policy of 
consolidating and transforming the country. We have 
restructured our steel industry and developed our tertiary 
sector, especially by consolidating the financial market and the 
audiovisual sector. We managed to execute these deep-rooted 
changes thanks to an economic and social policy that has enabled 
us to fulfil the convergence criteria set out in the Maastricht 
Treaty regarding economic and monetary union. Our concern was 
to position Luxembourg in this new Europe. 
  I think the two parties in the coalition converge in this 
respect, in so far as they are both committed to a social model 
that is also backed by our trade unions. We succeeded with this 
change, which was extremely deep and also vital for our country, 
in which two-thirds of all jobs in the steel industry were 
eliminated, without any social troubles. Of course, our parties 
-- I would not say the government -- have slightly different 
economic and financial orientations, but it is up to the 
government to integrate the various sensibilities into a 
comprehensive policy. A coalition government is a marriage of 
convenience lasting a specific period of time. 
  [Gueriviere] You have reached the end of this marriage of 
convenience. Are you now ready to ally yourself with the 
liberals if, as they hope to do, they oust the Socialists? 
  [Santer] We are not dismissing any party out of hand, no 
matter what it is, as long as it is democratic, of course. I 
myself was a member of a coalition with the Liberals. However, 
we here in Luxembourg are not in the habit of making 
declarations of intent before the voters have made their choice. 
  [Gueriviere] This would appear to cloud the image of the 
parties and complicate the voters' choice. But do not all the 
majority parties resemble each other as far as the voters are 
concerned? 
  [Santer] We are presenting a program and results. We have 
fundamentally reformed the funding of the social security 
system, in that we used taxation to finance retirements and in 
that we were able to maintain our social security contributions 
at a low cost. In this respect, we are complying with the 
recommendations set out in the white paper by Jacques Delors 
regarding taxation on the indirect cost of labor. 
  The Luxembourg model as we conceive it, with comanagement in 
companies and union participation via professional bodies, made 
it possible to safeguard the social peace. Twice a year, there 
is a round of tripartite negotiations to facilitate a dialogue 
between the government, employers, and employees. The outcome 
of these tripartite agreements is submitted to the Chamber of 
Deputies and it is Parliament that has the last word in deciding 
whether or not to ratify the agreements. The art lies in 
seeking a common denominator among the current trends. 
  In the latest agreements, the employers did not get 
everything they wanted, nor did the trade unions, just as the 
government was unable to impose all its views. However, 
overall, we succeeded in making our businesses more competitive 
by further lowering wage costs. This was done by having the 
state take charge of family allowance benefits. In exchange for 
a guarantee of employment, the unions agreed to a certain level 
of wage restraint. 
  [Gueriviere] Regarding the future of the European Union 
[EU], 
what will your attitude be at the intergovernmental conference 
on the institutions to be held in 1996, if the rights acquired 
by the Union's "small countries" are called into question in the 
name of greater EU efficiency? 
  [Santer] Our position is very clear. We agree to rearranging 
the institutions in order to make them more efficient, but we 
feel that, in the main EU bodies, we must now maintain the 
principle that each country participates "with an equal level of 
dignity," as President Mitterrand said during his state visit 
here in Luxembourg. Nor must we overlook the contribution made 
by "small- and medium-sized" countries to EU construction. I 
believe that a failure to take this contribution into account 
would be to deny the European spirit and the Community spirit, 
which is based on solidarity. The United States of Europe will 
not be put together along the lines of the United States of 
America, because our entire history runs counter to that sort of 
approach. There will always be Luxembourgers, just as there 
will always be Frenchmen, Germans, and Italians. Our wealth 
lies in this diversity, and every country must be able to 
contribute its ingredient to the Union. 
  [Gueriviere] Yes, but in observing the campaign for the 
European and legislative elections in Luxembourg, one can see 
nationalist reactions. Did you not underestimate your 
population's sense of national identity? 
  [Santer] Luxembourg is normally extremely reticent about 
anything from the outside, given that it is the smallest country 
in the EU. However, we must be well aware that our entire 
modern history shows that a "small" country like ours can 
survive economically and politically in a large group without 
losing its own identity. Our history has taught us that our 
position is becoming stronger in that we are sharing sovereignty 
with others. In the Maastricht Treaty, we do not lose part of 
our sovereignty, we simply transfer it to supranational bodies 
where this sovereignty is jointly wielded with our partners. By 
doing this we gain political importance. Moreover, our country, 
which was conceived as a buffer state between France and old 
Prussia, has every interest in consolidating peace. It is our 
mission to make the voters understand this. 
  [Gueriviere] In a Europe conceived with six or 12 members, 
it 
was clear that Luxembourg, as a founder member, played a role 
that was out of proportion to its true weight. With 
enlargement, does that not risk becoming less true? 
  [Santer] If, for example, we go by the number of deputies we 
have in the European Parliament, then you are right. However, I 
think I can say, and here I am going by my personal experience, 
that a small country can have an influence in the Union. An 
influence which is all the greater since it is isolated. 
  [Gueriviere] Luxembourg has just announced that it is 
joining 
the Eurocorps. What does that mean in actual fact? 
  [Santer] We made and announced a decision of principle. Now, 
it is a matter of preparing our participation by seeing how we 
can make a battalion available to NATO and at the same time 
participate in the Eurocorps. We are talking to NATO about this. 
  [Gueriviere] At the European Council in Corfu, will you 
support Jean-Luc Dehaene as successor to Jacques Delors, rather 
than the candidate from the Netherlands, which is your other 
partner in the Benelux? 
  [Santer] That is a delicate question! I have always said 
that I would support a Benelux and Christian Democrat candidate. 
The problem is that there are two! What I can tell you is that 
putting off the decision until later sends a bad signal about 
the functioning of our institutions and would not be credible to 
public opinion.

<F P=106> [By Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Text] Several soldiers and civilians were injured in a 
mortar bomb attack on a security forces checkpoint outside 
Crossmaglen, south Armagh today. 
  Police said the checkpoint, half a mile from the town centre 
on the Blaney Road, was manned by both police and troops. 
  A spokesman said the number and extent of the casulties was 
not known. No members of the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] 
were thought to have been hurt and first reports indicated no 
one was killed. 
  A single Mark 15 IRA mortar appeared to have been fired at 
the checkpoint from a VW van stopped a short distance down the 
road, said the spokesman. The mortar is said to have missed the 
checkpoint but to have exploded nearby. The checkpoint is part 
of the huge security cordon the Army and police have thrown 
around the area in recent weeks to protect construction workers 
strengthening the fortifications around the frequently attacked 
security base in Crossmaglen. 
  The Army said three soldiers had been injured and taken to 
Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry. Their injuries were not life 
threatening. 
  One civilian was treated by a local doctor, said police. 
  The mortar, which the IRA admitted firing, just missed the 
VCP [vehicle checkpoint] and caused damage to a nearby house. 
  Police said later up to four civilians suffered minor 
injuries. A police spokesman said there was no warning about the 
attack. "The attack was carried out by vicious and ruthless men 
who care nothing for the life and limb of any individual."

<F P=106> [By Teilo Colley, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] Fighting Irish terrorism is now the main task of 
MI5, the head of the security service said tonight. 
  In an unprecedented television appearance, MI5 director 
general Stella Rimington revealed that almost half the service's 
resources are now devoted to combatting the activities of the 
IRA and other Irish paramilitaries. 
  But MI5 must also contend with foreign extremists from the 
Middle East and elsewhere active in the UK, Mrs Rimington added. 
  "The service's overwhelming focus today -- three-quarters of 
our work -- is concentrated on terrorism. But the service's 
most important task -- and one which takes up nearly half our 
resources -- is mounting intelligence operations to counter the 
threat from Irish terrorism." 
  The revelation follows the decision in 1992 to give MI5 the 
lead over Special Branch in countering Irish paramilitaries on 
the mainland. Since then, the service is thought to have been 
instrumental in securing the arrest of several IRA bombers. 
  Referring to the risks faced by MI5 staff and their 
informants, Mrs Rimington said: "Intelligence gathering against 
terrorists is difficult and dangerous. Some of my staff and 
many others who work closely with us risk their lives to do it." 
  Mrs Rimington's comments on the role of MI5, the first to be 
uttered publicly by a head of the Security Service, came as she 
presented the Dimbleby Lecture tonight on BBC1. 
  In the lecture, entitled "Security and Democracy -- Is there 
a Conflict," she links the work of MI5 with the defence of 
democracy. This link has been questioned in the past amid 
allegations that the service showed bias in monitoring the 
activities of trade unionists and left-wing politicians. 
  Mrs Rimington, who became the first woman to head MI5 when 
she was appointed in 1991, said MI5 staff and their contacts are 
motivated by a desire to defend democracy. She also referred to 
the helicopter crash on the Mull of Kintyre in which 29 people 
died, including a number of MI5 staff prominent in the fight 
against terrorism in Northern Ireland. "They do it from a sense 
of public service and a firm belief in the rule of law and the 
democratic system. It is an anxious life for their families, 
who support them because they too believe in the importance of 
their work. When tragedy strikes -- as it did on such a scale 
with the helicopter crash on June 2 -- they suffer their losses 
silently and with dignity. We have much cause to be grateful to 
them all." 
  Explaining why counter-terrorism is now the service's main 
role, Mrs Rimington said "the collapse of Soviet communism had 
reduced the need for MI5 to concentrate resources on thwarting 
the activities of foreign spies in the UK -- one of its main 
roles for much of the Cold War. Countering espionage now takes 
up less than a quarter of our resources," she said. 
  Turning to MI5's work against foreign extremists, she said 
the service had scored several successes in combatting foreign 
terrorist groups and even other intelligence services who were 
trying to assassinate opponents living in the UK and elsewhere. 
  "As one example, we have helped to prevent the intelligence 
services of a number of Middle East states from carrying out 
sustained campaigns of murder against their opponents in this 
country and elsewhere. Members of Islamic extremist terrorist 
groups and terrorists from the Indian sub-continent have been 
identified and their plans disrupted." 
  The threat from international terrorism had declined from 
its 
peak in the 1980's, when Middle Eastern nations such as Iran and 
Libya were apparently sponsoring various terrorist groups, 
including the IRA. 
  But she added: ``In the foreseeable future I expect there to 
remain a significant threat to British interests, although the 
sources of it will vary from time to time. For example, the 
determined efforts to locate and kill the author Salman Rushdie 
seem likely to go on. 
  ``Extremists from parts of North Africa and also Kurdish 
groups pose an increasing threat of violence, including to 
British tourists. 
  ``And the conflict in former Yugoslavia could well spill 
over 
into acts of terrorism in Europe and elsewhere.''

  [Text] Canada has warned the Bosnian Government that it 
might withdraw its peacekeepers. Prime Minister Jean Chretien 
says Canada will scale back or cancel its peacekeeping effort if 
there is no progress toward peace or if the arms embargo on 
Bosnia is lifted. Mr. Chretien made the warning yesterday while 
visiting Canadian peacekeeping troops in Visoko, Bosnia. Canada 
has 800 soldiers there and another 1,100 in neighboring Croatia. 
  Mr. Chretien and other Western leaders discussed troop 
withdrawal earlier this week during D-Day ceremonies in France. 
He said a final decision on the peacekeeping force will be made 
in September when the Canadian peacekeeping mission expires. 
  The prime minister arrived home to Ottawa today after making 
the first ever visit to a war zone by a serving Canadian prime 
minister. Meanwhile, a one-month UN-sponsored cease-fire in 
Bosnia has gone into effect.

  [Text] Montreal, 10 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Canadian 
Government will suspend commercial flights to Haiti beginning on 
25 June, Andre Ouellet, the Canadian minister of foreign 
affairs, has announced. 
  He added that the decision to suspend commercial flights to 
Haiti was made to comply with a resolution that the OAS adopted 
last week calling for increased pressure on the coupist Haitian 
Government. Ouellet said that he plans to discuss with the 
cabinet the adoption of "additional measures," which according 
to official sources, "will affect the financial transactions" 
between the two countries. 
  The United States today announced the suspension of flights 
to Haiti, beginning on 25 June. 
  The Canadian Foreign Affairs Ministry also recommended to 
its 
citizens in that country to "leave the island while possible 
through regular flights."

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl by ZDF reporter </F>
Ernst-Dieter Lueg and an unidentified ARD reporter at CDU/CSU 
headquarters in Bonn -- live] 
  [Text] [Lueg] Herr Chancellor, you have said this election 
is also of a domestic nature, that it is a trial election. What 
is your summary on election night? 
  [Kohl] I have not used the term trial election. I have 
always pointed out that the turnout in the European election is 
of necessity quite markedly lower, and that we will quite 
certainly have a turnout of 79 to 80 percent in the federal 
elections in October. Of course, I am very happy with the result 
here tonight. My slogan has proven its truth: We sow the seeds 
in April and May, and the harvest comes in summer and autumn. 
And that is what has happened. [applause] 
  [Lueg] Herr Chancellor, the economic situation and 
development is good. Was that an advantage for you and your 
party in this election, and -- it is a while yet until the 
federal elections, but one could perhaps speak of a trial 
election? 
  [Kohl] I would like first to speak about the European 
elections, and then about the federal elections. Well, many 
people think it is a ritual -- I do not think so. I have walked 
a lot of streets and squares and I can only stand here as the 
chairman of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] of Germany, 
because I was helped by my political friends in the CDU and the 
CSU [Christian Social Union] with great efforts in a massive 
election campaign. I thank my friends who helped, and also the 
voters. Because if you read the forecasts a couple of weeks 
ago, they forecast quite a disaster for today. Now I stand here 
with great satisfaction; I am enjoying it, that is my style and 
that's why I am pleased. 
  [ARD reporter] But Herr Chancellor, the showing of the FDP 
[Free Democratic Party] cannot be satisfactory for you, for you 
are still dependent on the FDP as coalition partner. 
  [Kohl] Well, first of all, I think this is a European 
election. And in the last European elections, the FDP made quite 
a tight showing. Anyone who makes predictions tonight for the 
October elections with regard to the FDP is certainly quite 
wrong. It is quite certain that the FDP will be represented in 
the German Lower House in October. I have no doubt about that. 
That is something the FDP has seen on many occasions over the 
years. And that will happen again this time. I personally am 
sorry about this election result, but I say just as clearly that 
the FDP is not represented in the European parliament [sentence 
as heard]. I am particularly sorry for Frau Uta Wuerfel, who 
had an excellent campaign. Why should I not say that on this 
occasion? But that is the way things are, and we will work well 
with this result within the coalition, looking forward to the 
federal elections. 
  [ARD reporter] I'd like to follow up that question. Are 
there those in the FDP who do not support Herr Kinkel's course 
of remaining close to the CDU/CSU? Will that not become more 
difficult for you. Have you already phoned Herr Kinkel? 
  [Kohl] No, I have not yet had an opportunity to telephone. I 
have been devoting great attention to the election results. 
Whoever within the FDP draws the conclusion from this result 
that this is a reason to question the coalition -- nobody will 
reasonably do this -- will discover very quickly that is just 
what the voters will not respect. The voters -- I am firmly 
convinced tonight -- will clearly confirm the coalition in 
October. For us in the CDU/CSU, at least, today is an important 
step toward this development. 
  [Lueg] Do you see these elections as the voters' assent -- 
no 
matter what party they belong to -- to the Maastricht Treaty? 
  [Kohl] Yes, I think it is. It is very difficult for an 
ordinary person, with the very distant problems which are 
concealed within a treaty, to see clearly what it means. But I 
believe there is a clear majority in Germany in all democratic 
parties that Germany's future can only be assured within the 
European Union, that the old Adenauer saying from 1950 is still 
valid today: German unity and European unification are two sides 
of the same coin. To that extent, I am very pleased with it. 
  It is more difficult when there is such a distance -- 
Strasbourg is much farther away -- and there is above all no 
European government for or against which one can vote. People 
have to change their thinking, and that takes time. 
  [ARD reporter] If one looks at the former East Germany, 
particularly with the local election results, the showing of the 
PDS is quite remarkable, irrespective of how one evaluates that. 
In many forthcoming state parliament elections, can it be that 
only grand coalitions will be able to be formed? Will that not 
have repercussions on Bonn? 
  [Kohl] Well, first I would suggest we do not apply today 
this 
famous method, understandable among reporters... 
  [ARD reporter, interrupting] You say we must look to the 
future, so let's do that. 
  [Kohl] ...of predicting the next result, even on the 
election 
night. I have heard a lot of forecasts from famous journalists 
in the last few months, all of which were wrong -- for example, 
the prediction that the large parties would fray at the edges, 
that the age of the great popular parties is past. There can be 
no question of this. There is a groundswell to the large 
democratic parties, and even the FDP's result does nothing to 
change this, because this groundswell still exists for the FDP. 
I am firmly convinced of that. 
  [Lueg] Why are you so sure that the Free Democrats, who 
seemed very depressed on television tonight, will make the 
running on 16 October? 
  [Kohl] For the same reason I have for months been saying the 
CDU/CSU will win the elections. CDU/CSU will win the elections. 
Everyone thought I was just repeating myself like a clockwork 
model running down. The model is very practicable and very 
successful. [applause]

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl, CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union] chairman, has described the showing 
of the CDU and CSU [Christian Social Union] in the European 
election as a "very good starting position" for the forthcoming 
state parliament elections and for the Bundestag election in 
October. Following meetings of the CDU presidium and executive, 
Kohl said in Bonn this afternoon that the CDU and CSU have 
"reached an important stage." However, there are no grounds for 
sounding an all-clear. In the coming weeks and months, the CDU 
and CSU will have to fight for every vote, he stated. Kohl is 
also confident that the Free Democratic Party will again enter 
the new Bundestag.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by </F>
unidentified ARD correspondent; Scharping is speaking from Bonn 
-- live] 
  [Text] [ARD correspondent] The European election is not a 
signal for federal elections. That is what the next interviewee 
will say. SPD [Social Democratic Party] Chairman Rudolf 
Scharping live from Bonn: 
  [Correspondent] You have presented yourself quite clearly as 
the leading figure of the SPD. My question is, what is your 
share of the blame for the election result? 
  [Scharping] I say once again, we have not been able, in 
general, to convince workers that the European election is 
important since it is an election to the European Parliament. 
But we will succeed in that in the federal elections--I am 
firmly convinced of this. I am not downcast by the result; 
although on the other hand, it is clear that it is a setback. 
We lost the first round. 
  [Correspondent] Half of the people said this had a strong 
national German accent, this European election. Can you, under 
these circumstances, with this result, stick with the strategy 
that you have pursued so far. Or should you not change 
something in order to win on 16 October? 
  [Scharping] We will stick to the clear direction that 
unemployment in Germany has to be fought, that social justice 
has to be reestablished within the framework of a stable 
financial situation. I am quite sure that the turnout will show 
more than clearly that there is still a huge potential that we 
can win over. So we will stick to our clear direction. It would 
be silly to change the overall strategy of the party because of 
an election to the European Parliament. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Scharping, Joschka Fischer from the 
Greens criticized the SPD earlier for demonstrating too little 
profile and too little opposition. He was perhaps also thinking 
about the possibility of forming a joint government in the 
autumn. How do you view this? 
  [Scharping] I believe we have to make the SPD the strongest 
party; otherwise, nothing will change in Germany. We have to 
explain this in eastern Germany where, in my opinion, the PDS 
[Party of Democratic Socialist] is alarmingly strong, despite 
the considerable gains by the SPD in the local elections. We 
have a good opportunity in Saxony-Anhalt, but we have to 
convince the people in the East that every vote for the PDS cast 
in protest is perhaps understandable, but is indirectly useful 
for the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] under the current 
conditions. 
  [Correspondent] But you have been accused of copying Kohl. 
If that is the case, people would rather vote for the original. 
That is the accusation. 
  [Scharping] Yes, but that is not true from any viewpoint. I 
do not think I have to explain that now. This will become more 
than clear over the next few weeks. The second thing that the 
SPD has to do is to mobilize its support among the employees and 
to bring actual issues to the foreground. We have quite 
evidently not succeeded in this in the way I wished us to, given 
several careless debates in the SPD. Third, we have to make it 
clear that reform- orientated policies will only be possible in 
Germany if the SPD becomes significantly stronger on 16 October 
than it is at present. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Scharping, wasn't it perhaps after all a 
mistake not to try to push forward the ecological restructuring 
of our society? Instead, you cannot deny this, take a rather 
more conventional economic course? 
  [Scharping] If you could explain to me what is conventional 
about pursuing a clear labor market policy when 420,000 more 
people are unemployed this year than they were last year, when 
more will be done for families with children, then the problem 
is perhaps that not enough support has yet been mobilized for an 
economic and social reform policy. Incidentally, the SPD has a 
clear view on the environment and has formulated a clear reform 
program in this area, too. Of course, we will have to work 
harder in a more united and resolute way. 
  [Correspondent] Don't you think it is necessary to make a 
statement on your coalition intentions in favor of the Greens 
after all? 
  [Scharping] I am not thinking of making a coalition 
statement 
with regard to smaller parties. I do not think it is a good 
idea to create conditions where the tail wags the dog and where 
one concedes exclusive rights to the smaller party. That has to 
be made clear to every voter in Germany, and so I will repeat 
it: Reform politics in Germany will only be possible when the 
SPD is stronger.

<F P=106> [Report by Martina Fietz: "CDU's Positive Mood Upsets SPD"] </F>
  [Text] SPD [Social Democratic Party] Business Manager 
Guenter Verheugen sees difficult times ahead for his party until 
the Bundestag election. "But there is nothing new about that," 
he told DIE WELT yesterday. "I have never been in a state of 
euphoria, and I kept saying that the middle of the year would be 
a problematic time." 
  "The current situation is difficult because the coalition 
parties might create the impression that everyone is in a 
positive mood," Verheugen continued. "In addition the outcome 
of the European elections is unforeseeable, just as the outcome 
of the presidential elections was." At the same time, Verheugen 
described the SPD situation as "stable." "The objective of the 
forthcoming party congress in Halle must be to eradicate all 
signs of a depressive mood." 
  In the meantime, the SPD is concerned about getting rid of 
the impression that there might be differences of opinion on 
central issues concerning election strategy. Verheugen 
described rumors that he and party chief Scharping were at odds 
with each other concerning a coalition statement as "pure 
speculation." "The voters continue to determine the makeup of 
coalitions," he said. Therefore, the Halle party congress cannot 
adopt any specific statements apart from the one that the SPD 
does not want a grand coalition. In answer to a question about 
his remarks about the Greens being interpreted as a desire for 
an alliance with that party, Verheugen said he had merely wanted 
to express various options. "In this matter, I am in complete 
agreement with Scharping," he said. The SPD chairman is 
generally considered in favor of a socioliberal alliance. 
  In the meantime, voices can be heard within the SPD saying 
that the Halle congress will insist on the SPD sharpening its 
political countenance. "That need not necessarily lead to a 
coalition statement, but an alternative to the present 
government must be presented with greater determination than so 
far. The accompanying difficulties are being seen with 
increasing clarity. Last but not least, it remains to be seen 
in what way reforms, such as the environmental reforms 
concerning industry, can be financed," said Verheugen.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- FDP [Free Democratic Party] 
Chairman Klaus Kinkel has reaffirmed that his party will not 
change its course for the Bundestag elections despite its result 
in the European elections. "We are determined to continue our 
coalition with the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union]," Kinkel stressed at noon today after committee 
meetings of the Liberals in Bonn. He assumed that the FDP would 
"double" its Sunday [12 June] result at the Bundestag elections 
and that the coalition with the CDU/CSU could continue after 16 
October. The presidium and the executive had agreed that 
blaming individuals within the FDP would not help anybody. The 
party now had to concentrate on clarifying its policies to the 
people.

<F P=106> [Report by Christopher Rabe: "European Security Policy </F>
Requires a Broad Platform"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 8 June 994 -- At the meeting of the NATO 
foreign ministers, which starts in Istanbul today, Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel, with his counterparts, wants to draft a 
comprehensive reaction to Moscow's wish for a special status in 
its relationship with NATO. In an interview with HANDELSBLATT 
and the WALL STREET JOURNAL EUROPE, Kinkel stated that he and 
his Russian counterpart Grachev held intensive discussions of 
the speech Russian Defense Minister Grachev made to NATO. The 
first issue -- Russia's important position resulting from a 
special protocol in connection with NATO's offer of a 
Partnership for Peace -- will be discussed in Istanbul. 
  The head of the Foreign Ministry clearly rejected all 
Russian 
ambitions to link a European security system with the CSCE and 
the NATO Cooperation Council, and to accord NATO and its 
partnership concept less significance. Kinkel stressed: "Our 
answer is no. There will be no relations of superiority or 
inferiority between the CSCE, the NATO Cooperation Council, 
Partnership for Peace, and NATO." Moreover, Russia will not be 
granted any formal rights of veto. "The Western European Union 
[WEU] will decide independently whom it wants to accept. The 
European Union will base its decision on the accession of new 
countries on an economic and political analysis, and NATO will 
naturally also make its decisions without granting Russia a 
right of veto." 
  It is useful and expedient not to open up new gulfs but to 
incorporate Russia in Europe's new security and economic 
architecture. Thus, one can fully comply with Moscow's third 
wish, which is to intensify the process of consultation. 
  Russia's stabilization is not only taking place on a 
monetary 
basis in the form of multilateral and bilateral loans but also 
in many other ways through consultation. In this respect, 
Kinkel mentioned the banking law, which is being established 
with Western support, the creation of general legal structures, 
regional consulting activities, and schemes for medium-sized 
enterprises. At the same time he admitted that more funds are 
bound to be wasted in Russia because of its "enormous size" than 
in smaller countries, such as the Baltic states. "However, 
could anyone expect the transition from the command to the 
market economy to be smooth in a huge country like Russia," 
Kinkel asked. 
  Kinkel showed understanding for the mistrust with which 
Moscow views the establishment of closer relations between the 
Central and East European states and Western institutions. 
Whereas the Visegrad states (Poland, Hungary, the Czech 
Republic, and Slovakia) have already "entered the vestibule of 
the European Union [EU], the WEU, and of NATO" because of 
association agreements -- the so-called European agreements -- 
Russia is not likely to be granted access. For this reason, NATO 
has offered Moscow a cooperation agreement. Kinkel expressed the 
hope that it will be signed at the European summit in Corfu. 
The foreign minister described the necessary security 
architecture, in which states like Ukraine must also be 
included, as a "policy designed to establish a general network." 
  NATO, which "was and still is a classical defense alliance," 
has received important new tasks in a changed world -- "to keep 
and make peace." These new tasks should be the core of the 
European security architecture. Kinkel stressed: "NATO must 
help meet the need of the Central and East European reform 
states for security." NATO continues to be the main element in 
the transatlantic relationship. 
  According to Kinkel, there is a time- and a content-related 
aspect to the timetable for the eastward expansion of the EU. 
As far as the time-related aspect is concerned, he declined to 
mention an exact date. However, the process will probably last 
longer than the countries affected and the Germans hope, Kinkel 
pointed out. As far as the content is concerned, the Federal 
Government plans to involve the Visegrad states and the Baltic 
republics to a much greater extent politically at this point 
with a view to their full membership at a later date. Also, it 
is important for these countries to do their homework. "They 
must create legal structures and become economically more 
attractive through self-help." Bonn wants to provide assistance 
in this respect. 
  Kinkel is currently not enthusiastic about an enlargement 
according to the model of "concentric circles," suggested by 
Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer. In fact, he considers 
developments in this direction possible at a later point, but he 
would prefer an "organic growth" of Europe in the old 
structures. Kinkel admitted, however, that the enlargement of 
the EU by the East European states will pose considerable 
problems. Yet one cannot tell the countries to which closer 
cooperation has been offered for several years that there is no 
longer a free room in the European home. "We must coordinate 
this accession in an organic way with our partners. Germany 
will not take unilateral action." 
  Kinkel believes that, when carrying out institutional 
reforms, "the streamlining of procedures in the councils," the 
representation in the troika --consisting of the country that 
holds the presidency, its predecessor, and its successor -- and 
the order of presidencies must be reconsidered. it will be very 
difficult to settle these issues because the smaller countries 
will rightly react in a sensitive manner. Their interests must 
be taken into consideration. Germany in particular has always 
done so. 
  The foreign minister also criticized the varying intensity 
of 
integration in the European Union. In the common foreign and 
security policy, the Union has not yet reached the same broad 
development standard as in the economy. Kinkel cited the policy 
vis-a-vis the former Yugoslavia as an example. The EU is also 
"lagging behind" in the elimination of national border controls 
-- that is in the implementation of the Schengen Agreement. 
Thus, for Bonn the third major task is the development of legal 
and domestic policies as the third pillar of the European Union. 
"During the German presidency, we want to focus primarily on the 
fight against drug-related crime, money laundering, and the 
control of extremist and terrorist groups from non-EU states." 
  Another major task will be the fight against illegal 
immigration and crime involving the smuggling of refugees. In 
addition, Bonn will make efforts to harmonize legislation 
concerning violent riots -- with a racist background, for 
example -- and to develop joint measures against nuclear crime. 
The fourth major issue will be to create a Europe of the 
citizens. 
  Particularly in the weeks before the elections to the 
European Parliament, Kinkel has noticed "that people are not 
happy about the fact that Europe adopts executive decisions 
which have no legal basis." In fact, the Maastricht Treaty has 
brought a few new laws. The democratic deficit that still exists 
must be removed in the future. Kinkel wants to involve the 
European Parliament as much as possible during his Presidency of 
the European Council. 
  Kinkel expressed confidence about the upcoming referendums 
on 
EU membership in the countries of the European Free Trade 
Association [EFTA]. "After all the efforts that have been made 
in the four EFTA states, the population will probably not reject 
membership. Can you imagine that Finland, which is now facing 
difficulties because it has lost a large part of its market 
because of the disappearance of the bipolar world, will not take 
the opportunity of becoming a member of the EU? This is 
inconceivable for me." Kinkel is also convinced that the 
outcome of the referendum in Austria, which will take place as 
early as on Sunday [12 June], will be positive. 
  Germany's role in foreign policy has so far been 
characterized by reservedness. In view of the historical 
background, this was the right course, Kinkel pointed out. 
After reunification and the restoration of the country's 
sovereignty, the world now sees Germany in a different way than 
in the past. "The world wants us to step down from the 
spectator stand and assume responsibility." Kinkel expressed 
the hope that the "big administrative barrier" will be removed 
by the Constitutional Court in the summer. In his view, it 
should be possible in the future for German soldiers to 
participate in UN missions outside the NATO area after a 
parliamentary decision. However, Germany must never again pursue 
a policy of national unilateral efforts. "If we have drawn a 
lesson from history, it is the following: German interests must 
naturally be safeguarded, but within the framework of an 
integrated policy with the partners." Thus, Germany claims the 
position of a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

<F P=106> [Article by Winfried Muenster: "Amazing Spring Harmony in </F>
the NATO Camp"] 
  [Text] Istanbul, 10 June -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher considers the Partnership for Peace [PFP] program 
the "most important strategic institution since the founding of 
NATO." This plain statement contains a gentle reminder to his 
European partners, above all, his counterpart in Bonn, Klaus 
Kinkel. At the beginning of the NATO spring meeting, Kinkel had 
created the impression that he was toying with the idea of a 
"special relationship" between the Alliance and Russia, which 
could devalue the PFP (NATO jargon). 
  PFP is the invitation of the Alliance to the members of the 
defunct Warsaw Treaty and the CIS republics to enter into an as 
close relationship with NATO as each one of them wishes. For 
its part, NATO stops short at giving security guarantees, but 
holds out prospects of de facto membership for some PFP members. 
  It would be almost too good to be true if this invitation 
were followed in a way that its initiators, the Americans, have 
in mind. NATO would lead such a partnership and would be the 
supporting pillar of a security architecture which would 
virtually cover the globe north of the Tropic of Cancer. In 
this connection, the inner cohesion of the transatlantic 
Alliance would remain intact, and the status of the United 
States as the power guaranteeing Europe's protection and 
security would not be in jeopardy, despite Russia's presence. 
The East European neighbors would get what they were really 
seeking -- the warming closeness of the Western super power. 
  Thus Christopher's preventive resistance to a Russian chair 
with a higher back was only consistent, since Moscow with its 
demand for a special status had ulterior motives. Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev had specifically suggested that the NATO 
Cooperation Council be integrated into the CSCE and NATO itself 
be forced, through a binding consultation mechanism, into a 
subordinate relationship with the CSCE. 
  This was of course not acceptable to any of the 16 NATO 
allies. However, Christopher was the only one to make his allies 
aware that the PFP was intended as a flexible concept to honor 
Russia as the first power of the East. What else could a 
special relationship between Moscow and NATO bring about? It 
would certainly not replace or make unnecessary the higher 
hierarchy of the U.S.-Russian relationship nor, for that matter, 
the Europeans' search for orderly relations with the 
postcommunist Moscow. 
  So the U.S. secretary of state argued logically by referring 
the Russians with their special wishes to the national capitals 
from the start. Of course, in so doing, he kept in mind that 
Washington is the most important of all capitals. But there is 
a difference if it is the United States or Russia that has 
"ulterior motives." The outstanding U.S. position in any 
European security structure is absolutely indispensable and the 
centerpiece of the Western security philosophy. 
  It was not to be expected at any point that differences of 
opinion on the PFP would lead to a conflict within NATO. There 
was never a controversy, but there were differences over the 
precise formulation. What is more, in the difficult transition 
phase following the Cold War, the Alliance demonstrated almost 
amazing harmony in Istanbul, which sheds a paradoxical light on 
the European Union. The Alliance is ruled by the principle of 
strict unanimity, whereas the European Union has long viewed 
itself as something of higher value and even supranational. 
Nonetheless, it has not yet found its course in Europe. In 
NATO, however, even the French, the traditional dissidents, have 
fully endorsed the PFP project. 
  In Istanbul, the West had to find an answer to Russia's 
special wishes. The answer has been found, there will be no 
special status. However, the discussion on the PFP and Russia's 
place in the European security architecture has not yet ended. 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev used delaying tactics 
in Istanbul and called for further talks. He would possibly 
have agreed to a supplementary protocol that Kinkel had 
suggested prior to the NATO meeting. 
  The German foreign minister's argument is not unrealistic. 
Kinkel wants the Alliance to take into account that actually, it 
does not have the leeway of action that it claims it has toward 
Russia. He argues that NATO will be careful not to act against 
Moscow's declared will in East Europe, because, moreover, this 
would lead away from its goal, since security cannot be created 
there in confrontation with Russia. Antagonism would devalue 
the PFP and even reverse it. Its higher goal is to make Moscow 
agree to East Europe's orientation to the West. 
  No front line in Europe, is the Germans' motto. In dealing 
with Russia, however, the European allies are constantly 
reminded of the fact that it is the United States that has the 
decisive say on European security problems. Europe has always 
fared well with this principle.

<F P=106> [Report signed by "uhl": "Waigel: The Budget Will Be </F>
Consolidated Further"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The finance ministers of the laender 
governed by the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] have 
described the projected budget presented by Finance Minister 
Theo Waigel, Christian Social Union [CSU], for the years 1995-98 
as "unrealistic." What they have criticized above all is that 
the constitutionally necessary tax-free status of minimum 
incomes has not been considered and the fact that the Nuremberg 
Federal Office of Labor's budget is too low. 
  Waigel stressed that the government will firmly adhere to 
consolidating the budget over the next few years. The overall 
minimum expenditure that has been agreed for 1994 will be 
remain. Despite increasing signs of economic recovery, there is 
no basis for relaxing fiscal policy. CSU politicians have once 
again rejected an increase in taxes and dues. Johann Eekhoff, 
state secretary in the federal Economic Ministry, has reported 
that one can expect a increase in Germany's real economic growth 
of between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent. An increase of about 3 
percent should be possible in the years 1995 to 1998.

<F P=106> [Article by Winfried Muenster: "Presented as </F>
Self-Confirmation"] 
  [Text] The European Parliament, which German citizens are 
called upon to elect on 12 June, takes an almost sporting 
pleasure in forcing the finance ministers of the European Union 
to spend more money than they like. At the end of their 
five-year legislative period, the 518 deputies are presenting a 
report on their work to the public. We would have expected that 
this parliament, as the second budget authority after the 
Council of Ministers, would report on the development of 
spending and the most important points of the budget. However, 
the budget does not play a role in the deputies' report on their 
activities. Rather, a table catches our eye which says by how 
many millions the budget was increased above the finance 
ministers' drafts at the instigation of the Strasbourg 
parliamentarians. 
  In 1990, the Strasbourg people fought for, and got, the 
equivalent of 1 billion German marks [DM] for the young 
reforming states of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. A 
year later, they made sure that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's promise 
materialized that German reunification would not take away a 
single mark from the member states that traditionally receive 
subsidies from the Community. The parliamentarians made use of 
the Gulf war to secure additional funds, used their influence on 
behalf of refugees from Kurdistan, and increased aid for the 
Israeli occupied territories. On balance, they increased the 
budget by the equivalent of DM6.6 billion. It should be noted 
that the additional means were not only used for the current 
year, but had to be distributed over the rest of medium-term 
financial planning. 
  In its profit and loss account last year, the parliament 
frankly admitted that it believed it should "counter" on 
principle the Council of Ministers' draft following the first 
reading, because it was nothing but "a statistical operation of 
the finance ministers to reduce the preliminary draft of the 
Brussels Commission." So the deputies allowed their imagination 
to roam, and in so doing, finally detected the program "Konver" 
for the conversion of arms factories to civilian production. 
There simply is nothing with which the Strasbourg people would 
not deal. Their profit and loss accounting for 1993 amounts to 
DM6.8 billion. 
  In view of European Community budgets that clearly exceeded 
DM100 billion, this was not much. The scope of action that the 
parliament has been granted is not larger, however, and so the 
parliament creates the impression that taxpayers had no 
alternative but to flee, if its reins were loosened. Would it 
be better from the taxpayers' viewpoint if the European 
Parliament did not exist? This conclusion suggests itself, and 
yet is basically wrong. The experts of EC Budget Commissioner 
Peter Schmidhuber believe they know why the parliament is so 
ready to spend money -- because it lacks one of the basic 
parliamentary rights, namely fiscal jurisdiction. They say that 
within the scope of its limited authority, it can hardly do 
anything but call for higher expenditures and increase the 
budget in accordance with its leeway of action. A competent 
parliament that would have to justify its spending policy to the 
voters would, in all probability, for instance, not reserve half 
the Community budget for an agricultural policy that is judged 
favorably only by large farmers. We cannot contradict this. 
Therefore, taxpayers in particular should be interested in a 
parliament that would be equal with, not subordinate to, the 
Council of Ministers. 
  In the first years of its existence, parliamentarism 
justified itself with the need to control those who govern. In 
this sense, all parliaments in Europe have somewhat degenerated. 
Moreover, the European Parliament feels bound to the idea of 
redistribution to a larger extent than national parliaments. It 
shares this idea with the Commission and pursues it, without 
considering whether it is politically wise. In the report on 
their work, the Strasbourg people note with pride that they 
"succeeded in getting doubled, in real terms, the structural 
fund accepted." The structural fund includes all subsidies with 
the exception of agriculture, research, and social policies. In 
the five-year period from 1988 to 1992, it had been increased by 
100 percent in real terms. The capital endowment, including the 
rate of inflation, increased from DM16 billion to DM37 billion. 
  At that time, the generous donor countries obviously did 
not consider that receivers could declare the five-year doubling 
a political entitlement and demand a repetition for the next 
five years. This may sound like a joke to the thrifty budgeter. 
For the Strasbourg people, it was a foregone conclusion. They 
pursue redistribution deliberately and, if necessary, in an 
insidious way. In the research budget of the 1995 draft budget, 
they reduced subsidies for specific projects in favor of general 
titles such as "spreading of scientific knowledge." In this 
way, they wanted to make sure that economically strong member 
states with good laboratories receive less, whereas the poor 
neighbors on the periphery, where there is less research, 
receive more. The fact that German citizens must eat more 
expensive and worse bananas than before, because banana 
producers in France's overseas territories are to be subsidized, 
is no problem to the Strasbourg people. 
  In 1999, the structural fund will have been increased to 
approximately DM70 billion. Then the receivers will probably 
apply for doubling the fund again. The very parliament that has 
taken up the cause of European integration does not see that it 
will prevent integration through its bad policy of subsidies and 
redistribution.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans Joerg Sottorf: "Growing Concern Among the </F>
Social Democrats"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- There is a relaxed atmosphere in coalition 
circles. The party leaders and chairmen of Bundestag groups 
have been slapping -- figuratively speaking -- each others backs 
and are pleased at the success they have been experiencing over 
the past few months. 
  The CDU [Christian Democratic Union] bosses thanked their 
liberal colleagues for the "signal from Rostock," which confirms 
the will to cooperate following a success in the Bundestag 
elections in October. For their part, the FDP [Free Democratic 
Party] coalition partners congratulated CDU chairman and 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl for his successful appearances in the 
European election campaign in the new laender. 
  In the federal chancellery, one is surprised, but naturally 
delighted, that Kohl has been so successful on town squares in 
the new laender. The squares were normally full and no tomatoes 
and eggs were thrown. 
  The good mood in the CDU has received encouragement from the 
latest opinion polls, which place the CDU/CSU [Christian Social 
Union], with 36.5 percent, before the SPD [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany], with 35.5 percent. The prediction that the 
Republikaner would only receive 2.5 percent and would no longer 
have seats in the European Parliament was also considered 
pleasing. The FDP, however, is still nervous, despite a 
forecast of 6 percent of the vote, that it can no longer be sure 
of crossing the 5-percent hurdle in the European elections. 
  In contrast to the good mood among the coalition parties, 
there is growing skepticism within the SPD. The certainty that 
it will become the strongest party in the FRG European elections 
has evaporated. The criticism is that the SPD has mobilization 
problems. That not only applies to the European election 
campaign, but also to the dispute over domestic political 
problems. There is a feeling that a perfectly organized 
election campaign, like the one that has been conducted about 
Europe, will not help the party. This has been all the more 
disappointing when one considers that the CDU/CSU was extremely 
thrifty with funds in the case of the European election campaign 
and evidently wants to retain money for the federal election 
campaign. The CDU has placed the person of Kohl, a great 
promoter of Europe, at the forefront of its election campaign. 
The SPD has not done that, although party leader Rudolf 
Scharping has been desperately fighting to catch up with Kohl by 
making special train journeys. 
  SPD analysts have explained the disappointment by pointing 
out that the slow economic upturn is evidently linked with a 
change of mood among the population. In terms of foreign policy, 
the coalition has got better cards in its hands, because new 
crises have been avoided, and in terms of domestic policy, the 
SPD has created risks for itself. 
  This last admission is directly linked to the party's party 
political strategy and to the person of Scharping. Now that the 
FDP has come out clearly in favor of a continuation of the 
coalition with the CDU/CSU, strong domestic policy forces within 
the SPD are calling for a rival strategy that could only be 
modeled on the red-green coalition of Lower Saxony's Minister 
President Gerhard Schroeder. Scharping, however, wants to keep 
all his options open and to avoid making a statement on a 
coalition at all costs. He is being accused of still being 
inclined toward forming an alliance with the FDP or, if 
necessary, an alliance with the FDP and the Greens. 
  Following the fierce attacks from the FDP and the party 
conference decisions at Rostock, Scharping's election campaign 
strategists appear to be shocked. Such tough attacks were not 
expected from the FDP and are comparable to the attacks that the 
Liberals once launched against the CSU and its chairman Strauss 
in order to achieve an election campaign polarization that would 
get them over the 5-percent hurdle, and, as we know, they were 
very successful in that. 
  The question of why the SPD party leader and candidate for 
chancellor is not as popular among citizens and evidently within 
the party itself as at one time has greatly irritated the 
election campaign strategists in the Erich Ollenhauer House in 
Bonn. His "gross-net" confusion in connection with the 
supplementary charge called for by the SPD was the start of the 
Scharping dilemma. This was evidently a mistake -- one that was 
rapidly corrected -- that employees have found it very difficult 
to forgive. 
  There is confusion within the party about a policy toward 
the 
CDU. The fact that the person in question has remained silent 
has prompted conflicts within the SPD. However, at the upcoming 
party conference in Halle, Scharping also wants to avoid a 
statement on the coalition at all costs. The conference will 
see a secret and written vote on Scharping as a candidate for 
chancellor and that means that Scharping will face a difficult 
test within the party. 
  In view of the disappointing mood, SPD politicians have 
become overactive and are continually presenting new specialist 
programs, which has already made the CDU indulge in scorn and 
derision. Speaking in Bonn yesterday, CDU Spokesman Rofl Kiefer 
said: "The SPD program panic shows that Scharping is helpless 
and does not know what to do."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Lothar Ruehl: "Balance of Power"] </F>
  [Text] Four years after the self-dissolution of the Warsaw 
Pact, the broad mosaic of European security seems to be settling 
into a pattern. The outline of the desired "security structure 
stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok" is visible, but there 
is still no final construction plan for a solid edifice. 
  The attachment of equal significance to the concepts of 
"expansion" and "consolidation" in the European Union's [EU] 
integration policy possesses a parallel in NATO's integration 
policy. But no government has yet found a formula with which to 
apply this equation, with all its unknown quantities, to East 
Europe. The same applies to the yet-to-be-organized 
military-political WEU [Western European Union] alliance 
approved in 1954, which is supposed to assume the role of a West 
European defense alliance within the framework of the Maastricht 
Treaty. 
  The addition of new EU members to the ranks of the WEU has a 
positive and a negative effect. The positive effect is the 
expansion of the countries concerned within a political 
framework of consultations. The negative effect is the 
resultant distortion of the concept of joint security within 
NATO, whose "European pillar" the WEU has only just been defined. 
  Frederick the Great's famous words "he who wants to defend 
everything defends nothing," and "he who wants to be everyone's 
friend has no friends in the end" fit the situation of the West 
European allies in their three coalitions NATO, the EU, and the 
WEU. The danger that they will take on more than they can 
handle, overextend the strategic horizon of West Europe and the 
Atlantic alliance, and later collapse under the growing weight 
of their bloated security policy, now covering the whole of 
Europe, has become very clear four years after the end of Soviet 
power in East Europe. 
  Western politicians are now seeking safeguards in Moscow, 
their former great enemy. Russia, on its part, is seeking 
external support as consolation for its lost domination over 
East Europe. These interests can be brought down to a common 
denominator. But the latest Partnership for Peace offer will 
not be enough for a partnership with Russia, just as the CSCE 
and North Atlantic Cooperation Council, two auxiliary structures 
of the interim period favored by Moscow, are not enough to 
prevent an eastern expansion of NATO and guarantee Russia a 
decisive voice in European security by means of a link between 
the CSCE and the United Nations. 
  The wheel of bilateral relations, with NATO as a hub, will 
only turn if it is connected by a fan belt to Washington and 
Moscow. Otherwise the wheel will be out of gear, without 
touching the ground of concrete reality. This necessity is only 
now being realized in East Central Europe, which also includes 
the Baltic countries, Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania, as well as 
Hungary and Bulgaria. This feeling of reality is causing great 
skepticism about Western policy vis-a-vis Moscow. 
  Politics with Russia requires a concrete accord on major 
issues that transcends existing differences. Up to now, Western 
politics has created a mainly negative image by rejecting 
Russian demands: "No right to veto" an eastward expansion of 
NATO, "no sphere of interests" for Russia in the "near abroad" 
or anywhere else; "no condominium" between Moscow and Brussels 
over European security; and "no strategic partnership" in the 
sense of the present "Yeltsin doctrine" about Russian privileged 
"special relations" with the United States, NATO, and Germany. 
But even without a common security forum with Russia, no 
"stability shift" to the East can succeed. 
  So if Russia is not to be "isolated," an active connection 
in 
accordance with the original Partnership for Peace offer must be 
made. A security council will be required, in which a new 
version of the "European power concern" can be formed in order 
to look after the European scene. But because each country has 
a different weight on the scales of power, a "balance of power" 
[previous three words in English] will once again establish 
itself in order to make the whole scheme work. The bigger 
powers share a common concern over a balanced European setup in 
order to reduce risks to security. 
  Of course, several conditions are to be fulfilled in order 
to 
reach an accord with Russia. They include a firm NATO link to 
transatlantic partnership with North America and the inclusion 
of the four countries of Central East Europe; a geographical 
limit on the size of the EU, which cannot include the whole of 
Europe; and a core alliance surrounding France and Germany that 
includes Poland as quickly as possible and is supplemented with 
close relationships with Great Britain, in order to lay a broad 
foundation of security. In this way, the balance of Europe could 
be kept.

<F P=106> [Commentary by "pra": "Machine Pushing German Interests </F>
Through?"] 
  [Text] Something appalling has happened in the European 
election campaign: The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
has turned into the Christian Social Union [CSU]. The SPD has 
conducted the election campaign that one could have actually 
expected of the CSU after Bavarian Minister President Edmund 
Stoiber's attacks on Europe. No other party, except for the 
Republikaner, talked so much of "German interests" as the Social 
Democrats. In their election campaign, they turned Europe into 
a machine pushing German interests through. 
  Who remembers the election campaign that the SPD conducted 
five years ago? At that time, it tried to arouse enthusiasm for 
Europe. In 1994 it tried to warm itself at the national fire. 
The SPD is to blame for the strengthening of German national 
trends. It wanted to occupy the topics of the political 
opponents; it has thoroughly failed. In the polls its strange 
election slogans are related to the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/CSU or the Republikaner -- a just punishment. The SPD 
motto "security instead of fear" currently sounds like the 
invocation of social democratic views. The Greens (that is, the 
party that brought a charge against Maastricht in Karlsruhe) 
showed the SPD what a pro-European election campaign can look 
like in these days. 
  Chancellor Kohl's election campaign concept has worked: He 
was able to reprimand the CDU for going too far and he prevented 
the CDU/CSU from tearing itself to pieces in the controversy 
over Maastricht. Kohl succeeded in pushing the planned European 
currency, which violently moved the nation one year ago, into 
the background -- he anticipated the Bundestag election 
campaign. Therefore, gamblers like Manfred Brunner were not able 
to play the part for which they had hoped.

people, including many children, were kidnapped and killed in 
Kigali. 
  It is urgent that, during the OAU summit in Tunis, the 
countries in the area do their utmost in order to persuade the 
belligerents in Rwanda to put an immediate end to the fighting, 
the Foreign Ministry said. It has also called on the reinforced 
UN mission to be deployed as soon as possible in order to

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "D-Day Commemorations: Newfound </F>
Goodwill Between New Zealand and France"] 
  [Text] "Come back any time!" Such was, in the course of 
the colorful ceremony held at the New Zealand Embassy in Paris 
on Wednesday, 8 June, the cordial invitation made by Mr. 
Reginensi, deputy mayor of Conde-sur-Noireau. Mr. Reginensi was 
speaking on behalf of his counterparts from some 12 Calvados 
municipalities where, on 6 June 1944, there were many "Kiwis" 
(New Zealanders) among the landing allied forces. Who was he 
talking to? First of all, of course, to some 35 veterans who 
had made the "trip to world's end," often with their families, 
and who, white-haired or balding and rather self-consciously 
wearing their medals, were bent on proving, champagne glass in 
hand, that he who still knows how to wet his whistle cannot be 
deemed an old man. 
  The invitation was also addressed to Prime Minister Jim 
Bolger, the host of the commemorative ceremony, who was also 
"reciprocating" Michel Rocard's 1991 visit in Wellington, under 
circumstances less auspicious than this 50th D-Day 
commemoration. "The head of the French Government had come to 
acknowledge mistakes made in the Rainbow Warrior affair, and his 
apologies had been received with the same generosity as had 
inspired their formulation," a royal and good-natured Jim Bolger 
recalled for us. 
  Ever since, "bilateral relations have been excellent," said 
the New Zealand prime minister, who met with his French 
counterpart, Edouard Balladur, and is scheduled to meet with the 
president of the Republic. He added: "We were especially 
pleased with Francois Mitterrand's announcement that France does 
not intend to resume atomic testing in the Pacific. We can only 
hope that next year his successor will stick to this position." 
Mr. Bolger also notes with satisfaction that "New Caledonia, to 
which we are close, is now engaged in a peaceful process of 
political change." 
  No hard feelings about the hard-nosed GATT talks, during 
which south Pacific countries had found it hard to understand 
some French positions they perceived as "protectionist?" "None 
whatsoever! Had our respective positions been in harmony from 
the start, we would definitely not have needed seven years of 
talks!," Mr. Bolger said. Indeed, it is generally considered 
that New Zealand, whose main exports remain farm products, will 
be among those countries which will benefit from the new world 
trade order as of 1 January [1995], both because of the ensuing 
price increases and the opening of new markets for its products. 
  And the prime minister went back to his guests; the most 
prominent among these was Beatrix de Massin, whom he made a 
member of the Order of the Queen's Service for hiding for 
several days, with the help of her mother, a New Zealander whose 
plane had been shot down in Normandy on 12 June 1944. Another 
guest of honor was Gerard Whincop, the pilot saved by the 
providential French woman.

  [Text] Paris today hosted the Lebanese National Congress, 
which supports General Michel 'Awn. Michel 'Awn has been living 
in exile in France for five years. He pledged not to express 
his views but he has not given up the idea of playing a 
political role in his country. He wants his country to stop 
being the hostage of the rather complicated relations between 
Syria and Israel. This is in substance what he said to Helene 
da Costa: 
  [Begin 'Awn recording] We are awaiting recommendations in 
order to get out of the stalemate in which Lebanon now finds 
itself and the peace negotiations with Israel because things at 
present are in a deadlock. Lebanon is totally signed away to 
Syria. It cannot do anything. It is there, but it is absent. 
  My proposals cannot be announced without being adopted [as 
heard] yet I advocate a change in the shape of the table. The 
table should not be bilateral, it should be trilateral: Syrian, 
Lebanese, and Israeli, because each of the two remaining forces 
claims to be in Lebanon because the other is there. If there are 
three of them, they cannot use this as a pretext. They must 
answer specific questions. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Jean Bothorel: "Union Ambiguities"] </F>
  [Text] Neither Edouard Balladur and Jacques Chirac, nor 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing have taken part in the debate started 
by Dominique Baudis [head of the majority's European election 
list], who does not want to combine votes with those of Philippe 
de Villiers [head of a dissident, anti-Maastricht list]. 
Charles Pasqua and Bernard Pons, however, made it clear that 
the votes garnered by the two lists should be combined. 
  Was such a point worth a debate? The "union of the majority" 
is a very ambiguous notion that can easily be turned on its ear. 
While such a union can legitimately find its governmental 
expression in the shape of a coalition, it has never assumed the 
shape of a single party or a single group in the National 
Assembly: There were and are the RPR [Rally for the Republic] 
and the UDF [Union for French Democracy]. Before the 
parliamentary election of March 1993, there was no such thing as 
a homogeneous UDF, but an incomplete UDF alongside the UDC 
[Union of the Center]. So UDF cohesion is a very recent thing, 
and it mostly stems from Valery Giscard d'Estaing's dogged 
determination. Moreover, such a cohesion is fragile, and it is 
well-known that some people would be delighted to see it killed. 
  RPR-UDF voters do not delude themselves on the scope of such 
a union, whose praises are being sung by every one of its 
leaders. In fact, union is an electoral slogan and strategy, 
especially as with regard to parliamentary and European 
elections as well as, to a lesser extent, municipal elections. 
It definitely does not mean that the various partisan families 
have merged or disappeared behind a single flag or man. 
  In such a context, the De Villiers list was bound to find 
its 
rightful place. In 1989, when Valery Giscard d'Estaing was 
leading the union list, Simone Veil played the part of the 
dissident. Given the popularity she was credited with, she had 
set the mark quite high, between 12 and 15 percent. Very soon, 
it appeared she was going to fail. She ended up with 8.42 
percent --nothing to be ashamed of -- while Valery Giscard 
d'Estaing achieved nearly 29 percent. The parliamentary Right 
totaled 37.3 percent of the votes, a result as outstanding as it 
was unexpected. 
<H5>  Demanding Electorate </H5>
  Philippe de Villiers' performance appears to be the opposite 
of Simone Veil's. If the last opinion polls that were made 
public are anything to go by, he has been gaining ground 
steadily, thus becoming a disruptive factor within the majority. 
While initially his list was only credited with an estimated 5 
percent, it could now match the result achieved by Simone Veil's 
list, or even improve on it. That would spell unmitigated 
success for Mr. de Villiers. The Maastricht affair has made its 
mark, and times have changed. 
  In short, nobody can ignore Philippe de Villiers today. But 
was it necessary to strengthen him by attempting to exclude him 
from the majority? As the campaign draws to a close, Dominique 
Baudis' opponent is no longer [Socialist Party Secretary 
General] Michel Rocard, but Philippe de Villiers. Three weeks 
ago, the latter would not have dared dream of such an improved 
standing. 
  He has undoubtedly struck a chord within the RPR and the 
UDF. 
Evidence of this are the meetings he organized, which were well 
attended. To achieve the shift from activist mobilization to 
the mobilization of a fraction of the electorate, he only needed 
a little help: He has now got it from the leaders of the 
RPR/UDF list. 
  As soon as Monday [13 June] morning, the stage will be set 
for the presidential battle. In the majority, contenders for 
the top job are already known. 
  To be sure, the "union" or "rally" theme will be a core 
concern and topic for the presidential candidates who, as we 
saw, studiously refrained from direct and explicit attack 
against Philippe de Villiers. 
  In fact, while the government and the various parties have 
carefully avoided giving the impression that this election had 
much importance in terms of internal politics, it might mark the 
beginning of serious turbulences both within the Right and the 
Left. 
  As for the Right, if the De Villiers phenomenon is confirmed 
by voters on Sunday, it should force the various presidential 
candidates to tone down their union-at-all-costs rhetoric. 
Voters might be becoming more demanding as to the force and the 
nature of commitments. To paraphrase the word of General de 
Gaulle on Europe, there is no certainty that repeating, 
mantra-like, "union, union, union" will convince anyone. 
Especially as everybody knows very well that behind this noble 
word lurk significant political differences on issues. Not to 
mention feuds.

  [Text] The "new alliance" of leftist forces proposed by 
[Socialist Party, PS, Secretary General] Michel Rocard has 
elicited new and quite diverse reactions. Roland Dumas thought 
that it is "a good, but not a new idea." Deferring this debate 
until after 12 June, the former minister noted sanctimoniously 
that "if the results turn out to be in line with opinion polls, 
they will not be good," and that "for a large party such as the 
PS, this would certainly have consequences for the party...and 
on Michel Rocard's presidential candidacy." 
  Bernard Tapie called on Rocard "to be with the Left if he 
wants to become president of the Republic one day." He 
anticipated a victory of the Left in the presidential election 
"provided that, alongside the PS, there is a force with its own 
identity which would be able to attract the 22, 20, 18, or 17, 
or whatever percentage of the vote needed" to win the election. 
  Jean Pierre Chevenement affirmed that the reconstruction of 
the Left "cannot be achieved only through Mr. Rocard's party and 
`Mr. Finance' Bernard Tapie." "The future of the Left lies in 
its unity. But it is not the pact for unity and progress of 
[Communist Party leader] Robert Hue, nor Michel Rocard's new 
alliance which will tell us anything about its contents," the 
deputy mayor of Belfort complained. Finally, Francis Wurtz 
[head of the Communist European election list] called the "new 
alliance" proposal a "political coup four days before the 
ballot," and he accused Rocard of "not having broken with the 
old tradition of crippling compromises."

<F P=106> [Report by Olivier Provost: "French-German Arms Agency To </F>
Be Established Soon"] 
  [Text] According to the Defense Ministry, this organization 
will be created next year. It will be allocated the 4.5 billion 
francs [Fr] earmarked annually for military cooperation and will 
focus on bilateral military programs. 
  The 63d Franco-German summit held last week in Mulhouse has 
given impetus to the proposed Franco-German arms "structure" -- 
there is no talk of it having the status of a formal agency, 
although officials recognize it will be very similar. The 
process appears to be in its final stage as the French Defense 
Ministry has now set a deadline for the creation of the 
structure: September 1995, that is, in a little over a year's 
time. The quasi-agency set up by Paris and Bonn is expected to 
integrate bilateral weapon programs ("Tigre" assault helicopter, 
antitank missiles, the VBM modular armored vehicle.) But it 
will also include Franco-German participation in joint programs 
with third parties (NH-90 helicopter, ATF heavy transport 
aircraft, satellites, etc.). This, in cases where the combined 
French and German shares exceed 50 percent of a program, will 
amount to a virtual takeover of the project on the part of Paris 
and Bonn. The Franco-German arms agency will also cover 
bilateral research and technology, for which there are already 
80 projects. This has already had the effect of prompting some 
harmonization, including in preliminary research for helicopter 
design, a field in which, despite the creation of Eurocopter 
(Aerospatiale, 70 percent; Deutsche Aerospace, 30 percent), 
resources remained to be pooled. The Franco-German agency will 
also work on future equipment for the Eurocorps, which is mostly 
made up of French and German soldiers. Last, it will integrate 
parameter studies for long-term military planning (up to 
2010-2015), as well as the first preliminary technical and 
operational studies on future threats. 
  The annual cost of this Franco-German cooperation will total 
Fr4.5 billion out of the French Armed forces' Fr100-billion 
equipment budget. The project will produce some items, mostly 
missiles, but its main focus will be development (of armored 
vehicles, helicopters.) Overall, it will cost its French and 
German sponsors more than Fr60 billion. This makes a compelling 
case for such an agency, which in future could be opened up to 
Belgium and the Netherlands; the latter maintain close ties with 
the Germans, including a joint army corps. Paris has even been 
considering establishing another quasi-agency with the Italians, 
who have been working with France on several large programs (a 
torpedo, a satellite, the Aster missile, the NH-90 helicopter.) 
Such an increased focus on cooperation is firmly rooted in 
reality. Today, on the eve of the implementation of the 
1995-2000 military programming law, the share of cooperation in 
France's defense programs budget is 25 percent. By the end of 
the programming period, in the year 2000, it will have reached 
40 percent, a boom that will require an appropriate structure. 
<H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5>
<H5>  Research Credits to Small Companies To Be Doubled </H5>
  On the occasion of the fifth birthday of the Richelieu 
Committee, which includes 75 percent of the small- and 
medium-sized businesses [SME] active in the defense field (92 
firms), DGA [General Armament Delegation] Director Henri Conze 
said: ``I ask all DGA operational directorates to at least 
maintain and even increase the preliminary research credits 
allocated to SME's from one year to the next, whatever happens 
to the Defense Ministry's research budgets. 
  ``Furthermore, the DGA will endeavor to double the share of 
SME's in its budget for preliminary research by the end of the 
current programming period: Thus, within six years we must 
increase from 6 to 12 percent preliminary research credits 
allocated to SME's.''

<F P=106> [Article by Arnaud Leparmentier and Pierre-Henri de </F>
Menthon: "Is the COB Doing Its Job"--first paragraph is LE 
NOUVEL ECONOMISTE introduction] 
  [Text] Is the Stock Market Operations Commission doing too 
much in its triple role of legislator, policeman, and judge? 
Yes, according to some, when it goes after a few cases in order 
to make examples of them. No, according to others, when it 
closes its eyes in the name of the market credibility. Unequal 
justice? 
  On 26 April during the ritual presentation of the annual 
report of the Stock Market Operations Commission (COB), nobody 
was really listening to its chairman Jean Saint-Geours' speech. 
Addressing the financial and economic press, his director 
general Pierre Fleuriot at his side, this affable man could 
expound on restrictions on voting rights, criticize French 
boards of directors, and rejoice at the improved operation of 
the mutual fund system. But on that day on the ninth floor of 
Mirabeau Tower, Quai de Javel, Paris, the audience had its mind 
on other matters: the latest financial debates agitating the 
Paris Stock Exchange and a question: Was the COB, whose mission 
is to defend investors, doing its job? 
  On 14 April it issued a warning contesting the conditions 
and 
terms of the Pinault-Printemps/La Redoute merger. Many 
considered this audacious move beyond the scope of the COB's 
powers. Under corporate law, mergers are the concern of the 
general shareholders' meeting and it alone. The debate is all 
the more heated because the operation was handled by Lazard, the 
most prestigious of the investment banks, and was backed by 
Georges Bathes de Ruyter, head of Arthur Andersen France, and 
Rene Ricol, new president of the certified accountants' 
association. The COB responded by saying: "We have carried out 
our duty to provide the public with fuller information, even if 
we are aware that we cannot prevent the operation." Later, in an 
interview granted to LE FIGARO on 27 April, Jean Saint-Geours 
disassociated himself from the legal actions initiated by La 
Redoute's minority shareholders to quash the operation. Turning 
first one way and then the other, COB's trial-and-error approach 
to this case will have caused many a pen to bleed. 
  Another recent action that has raised a ruckus is the 
Jean-Francois Henin "affaire." This high flying financier, the 
former head of Altus and Jean-Yves Haberer's right-hand man, 
took over Electricite et Eaux de Madagascar (EEM) from Credit 
Lyonnais as a shell corporation for obtaining investor 
financing. The funds were to be used for risky investments in 
U.S. coal and real estate. A bad idea, according to the COB: 
"Listed securities are sound stock. It is normal to exclude 
Jean-Francois Henin's project." In order to protect the 
investor, the COB decided to limit access to EEM to "informed 
investors" able to invest at least half a million francs. It 
also recommended that EEM should simply be struck from the 
official list. These measures shocked many legal experts, 
horrified to see the COB overstep its powers again in the name 
of its sacrosanct vocation of protecting the investor. 
  This mission is so ambitious that it is becoming impossible. 
Still, in order to fulfill it, on 2 August 1989 the Treasury 
officials who head the Commission got parliament to grant it 
powers that exceed those of the highly feared SEC (Securities 
Exchange Commission) [as published] in the United States. The 
COB has tripartite power to control all financial operations for 
the investor's protection: legislative power (it writes its 
rules); executive power (it applies them); and judiciary power 
(it imposes penalties on those who break them). After five years 
of trial and error, the COB is still having trouble using this 
power wisely. It seems to be doing either too much, when it gets 
involved in the affairs of Francois Pinault or Jean-Francois 
Henin, or too little, when national interests or market 
credibility may be threatened. 
  In the very political Rhone-Poulenc privatization operation, 
it dared to issue a harsh "opinion" on the chemical group's 
accounting procedures. However, it gave no publicity to these 
comments, which are buried on page 29 of the memorandum 
published in the economic press. There was no question of 
serving due and proper "warning" on the company in an operation 
of such strategic importance for the government. 
<H5>  Sidestepping the Issues </H5>
  In another sensitive case--Credit Lyonnais--the COB has been 
conspicuous by its discretion. "This is a matter of a credit 
institution, which operates on trust. Making a concern public is 
always delicate," Jean Saint-Geours says to those who criticize 
his inaction. He offers an additional explanation that sidesteps 
the issue: "Credit Lyonnais' primary watchdog is obviously the 
Banking Commission, since the company's stock is not widely 
traded." Still, nonvoting preference shares in the bank are 
listed on the Stock Exchange. The COB's chairman also pays 
little heed to Thomson-CSF, a bellwether company on the Stock 
Exchange that, with a 20-percent interest in Credit Lyonnais, is 
directly affected by the bank's difficulties. Alain Gomez' group 
is currently unable to close its books because of its 
participation the bank's rescue. 
  The third sin of omission is the case of Euro Disney. 
Certainly, a routine investigation of the stock's performance is 
still underway. However, the COB's duty to provide accurate 
information and defend the investor's interests has gone by the 
board. "In the face of this disaster, it is difficult to reach a 
decision on the treatment of the minority shareholders," the 
COB's chairman says to excuse his silence. In an instance of 
flagrant inequality, some shareholders and creditors have 
received privileged information in the form of a report on the 
park's actual position by the KPMG accounting firm. "I would 
have preferred for the report to have been made public," says 
Jean Saint-Geours, who has not intervened to end this 
informational inequality. 
<H5>  Enlightening Minds </H5>
  Deemed too strict by some and too lenient by others, the COB 
has opted to fulfill its mission by the most audacious means: 
making examples. Though it denies doing so, faced with the 
inability to monitor everything on behalf of investors, it has 
made a big commotion over certain cases that it considers worthy 
of interest. Its goal is to find an example that can inform and 
contribute to case law--even if this sometimes means breaking 
the rules. The COB's offices at Mirabeau Tower make no secret of 
the fact that it considers going by the book a heavy constraint. 
  In 1991 Bertrand d'Illiers, then head of the Commission's 
accounting office, wrote in HAUTE-FINANCES that his long tenure 
in that post had allowed him "to make the COB very influential 
with respect to legal doctrine. Moreover, I have been able to 
take advantage of the vagueness of the laws to act effectively 
by exceeding the scope of the COB's powers." Jean Saint-Geours 
had prepared the ground for this philosophy two years earlier in 
the Commission's bulletin: "In 20 years, the COB's efforts have 
made it a regulatory authority. It has worked skillfully and 
rigorously to create a body of case law by using the laws and 
even going beyond them." However praiseworthy it may be, does 
the end justify these means? 
  As a result of its overzealousness, the COB has been 
reprimanded in the courts on several occasions for overstepping 
its powers. In January 1993 the Court of Appeal voided a 
300,000-franc [Fr] fine which the Commission had imposed on 
Christian Derveloy, former head of the VEV textile group. The 
grounds cited were violation of the presumption of innocence by 
announcement of the initiation of administrative proceedings in 
a press release. The COB learned its lesson from this case. "We 
no longer give out information until the penalty has been 
decided. This is what we did in the Ciments Francais and Yves 
Saint Laurent cases in which the directors were fined," a 
department head says. But publicity is a penalty, too. Didier 
Pineau-Valencienne, the head of Schneider, learned this to his 
own cost when, in early 1993, helpless and terrified, he saw the 
COB release to the press a letter of reprimand concerning 
Schneider's financial information. 
<H5>  Cannot Be Sued </H5>
  However, the courts are ill-equipped to repair any injury 
caused by the Commission. The COB is more or less immune from 
prosecution. The legislature, while allowing its chairman to 
investigate whatever he pleases, forgot to provide it with any 
legal competence. As demonstrated by the 6 April decision in the 
Compagnie Diamantaire d'Anvers case, to obtain damages from it, 
it is necessary to sue the state directly and to establish the 
existence of "culpa lata" [liability] --an all-but-impossible 
legal exploit. 
  The COB has decided to take action to counter these 
criticisms. With its Fr131 million budget, its 226 employees, 
and its power to target everything involving publically traded 
securities, turn case records over to the government for legal 
investigation, and impose fines of up to Fr10 million, the COB 
has accepted reality: one cannot do everything and do it well. 
It has undertaken reforms with two goals in mind: simplification 
and delegation. "I want to trim and simplify everything I can," 
Treasury official Pierre Fleuriot said shortly after his 
appointment as director general. That was in March 1991. Since 
then, the Commission has standardized the approval of bond 
issues, reduced the period required to obtain authorization to 
launch a mutual fund by several months, and developed a 
simplified, easy-to-understand prospectus for stock issuers. 
Millions of these two-page summaries have been distributed to 
banks on the occasion of privatizations. And that is not all. On 
26 April Jean Saint-Geours confirmed that from now on the COB 
will issue approval for mutual fund management companies instead 
of each individual mutual fund. This is good news for the 43 
employees responsible for monitoring the 2,856 mutual funds and 
unit trusts on record at the close of 1993. 
  This simplification can be achieved only by increased 
reliance on outside professionals. The COB itself no longer 
checks the work done by the auditors of listed companies. 
However, it still expects these account auditors to inform it 
annually of any anomalies they have noted in the course of their 
audits. It would like to extend this procedure to the work of 
capital contribution and merger auditors beginning in 1995. As 
for mutual funds, whose accounting and management procedures 
recently underwent extensive changes, the COB intends to rely 
more and more on the professional organization, the French 
Association of Investment Companies and Funds (ASFFI). 
<H5>  Is the Stock Exchange Mature Enough? </H5>
  Pierre Fleuriot has another major project: developing the 
role of independent opinions and certificates of fairness. The 
principle is simple. When investors do not have all the data on 
an operation in hand, the Commission will suggest that 
investment banks or independent auditing firms certify its 
irreproachable nature and financial fairness. The idea has 
already been tried on several public tender offers: the Bernard 
Tapie Finance OPR [compulsory buyout offer], Altus and CIP's 
friendly OPA [cash tender offer] on Fnac, and Lagardere Groupe's 
OPE [public exchange offer] on Matra-Hachette. It is not clear 
that the Stock Exchange is mature enough to find experts who do 
not have conflicting interests and are qualified to judge the 
fairness of an operation in an absolutely independent manner. 
The COB will not be successful in its mission until the major 
bankers and certified accountants have gained universal trust by 
adhering to a code of ethics. 
  More generally, one cannot expect the COB to be more 
credible 
than the market it is supposed to monitor. 
<H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5>
<H5>  The Sheriff of Mirabeau Tower </H5>
  "Emotionally disturbed," "full of himself"--there is always 
some corporate lawyer, banker, or financial director to whisper 
a kind word, off the record of course, about the 40-year-old 
director general of the Stock Market Operations Commission 
(COB), Pierre Fleuriot. Some say his only dream is to take the 
place of his boss, Jean Saint-Geours, whose term as chairman of 
the Commission expires in October 1995. Even if he does not, 
given the meticulous care with which he as always managed his 
carrier, there can be little doubt: Fleuriot will energize one 
of the market's biggest financial institutions. In presenting 
the annual report on 26 April, Jean Saint-Geours commented that 
"one cannot make a carrier of the COB, not even half a carrier." 
  The always impeccably dressed Fleuriot can easily explain 
the 
stream of spiteful remarks by jealousy. Do they hit their mark? 
When by chance he agrees to meet with reporters, he rarely 
confides. In March 1991 when he became director general of the 
Commission--a post invented out of thin air--he told his staff 
that his role would be the most thankless one: that of punch 
bag. He would take a pounding from the Treasury, where he is 
criticized and envied for helping an administrative authority 
endowed with increased powers fly on its own power. He would 
also take one from the captains of Parisian capitalism in 
response to an increasing self-assured COB's frequent blockage 
of certain maneuvers. "He is extremely dangerous and powerful," 
says one banker, "but he is a pro." For the COB's director 
general, such condemnation is a proof of independence. Surely, 
for this senior official who has always needed to be liked and 
acknowledged, this must be a difficult calling.

<F P=106> [Statement by Cavaco Silva, prime minister and Social </F>
Democratic Party leader, at Democratic Party Headquarters -- 
live] 
  [Excerpts] The objective of the Social Democratic Party 
[PSD] in these elections was to maintain the same support when 
compared with the last elections for the European Parliament in 
1989. According to the latest figures available, the PSD has 
gone up when compared with the last elections and according to 
the latest results, the PSD has practically the same number of 
votes as the Socialist Party. [passage omitted] 
  This good PSD result is due mainly to the excellent campaign 
carried out by the PSD candidates. I would like to say here a 
word of very high praise for Engineer Eurico de Melo who 
campaigned with great dignity and seriousness without attacking 
or insulting anyone. [passage omitted] 
  I am not here to say that the PSD had a great victory in 
these elections. It is important to note that all parties lost 
votes when compared with the last European elections. As in 
other European countries, the abstention rate was extremely 
high: 64.5 percent. 
  Contrary to what the opposition tried to achieve, the 
Portuguese people did not accept that these elections have any 
other significance other than the choice of MEP's [Members of 
the European Parliament]. [passage omitted] 
  The high abstention rate reflects a certain distancing of 
the 
Portuguese from European matters, but it also reflects the 
stability of Portuguese political life. Voters believed that it 
was not a question of major national choices and that therefore 
they could run the risk of not voting. 
  I want to congratulate all the deputies who have been 
elected 
to the European Parliament from the other parties. I hope that 
all those elected will work together with the government to 
defend Portugal's interests. Here in Portugal we can have 
different stances, but abroad we must all row in the same 
direction. The Portuguese Government will do its utmost to 
support the Portuguese Members of European Parliament. 
  Last, I would like to say that tonight the Austrians have, 
with a big majority, chosen to join the EC. According to the 
figures available the backing for a yes vote was enormous. I 
congratulate the Austrian people. They are very, very welcome 
in the European Union.

<F P=106> [Statement by Antonio Guterrres, secretary general of the </F>
Socialist Party, from party headquarters in Lisbon -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Guterres] First, I would like to congratulate 
all the Portuguese and in particular, those who voted today, who 
today understood that it was important to exercise that 
fundamental civic right in a democracy. 
  I would like to warmly thank Socialist Party [PS] members 
and 
Socialist candidates whose dedication, strength, and courage 
made this new Socialist victory possible. Please allow me a word 
of special thanks and admiration for Antonio Vitorino. For me, 
in all honesty, he is the big winner of these European 
elections, and I believe that the country and the PS have in him 
a top political figure who will make a decisive contribution to 
our democracy in the future. 
  This Socialist victory, I must confess, is particularly 
welcome. Above all because of the difficult circumstances under 
which the Socialist Party had to fight this electoral battle. 
Not long ago it was said that these were the most difficult 
elections for the PS. Even so, and according to the official 
forecasts available at the moment, the PS has managed to win. 
In so doing it has won elections in Portugal for the second 
consecutive time -- which had not happened since 1976. [passage 
omitted] 
  This victory strengthens the relation of trust between the 
country, between the Portuguese and the PS. But it also 
strengthens our responsibility in preparing a serious 
alternative government for Portugal. An alternative that we do 
not want to prepare alone. We want to do it with an intense 
dialogue with the whole of civil society, with the many 
independent candidates who are willing to collaborate with us to 
provide a future for our country that is better than the 
present. [passage omitted] 
  In our opinion it is not enough to change the government. It 
is necessary to change the way Portugal is governed. It is 
necessary to have a better democracy in Portugal. A democracy 
with more dialogue, with more participation, where power and 
resources will be more decentralized toward the regions and 
local government. Also, a democracy with more transparency in 
order to combat more effectively favoritism and corruption that 
have disappointed so many with Portuguese political life. 
  It is also necessary that those who govern are more 
attentive 
to the need to give an absolute priority to education, or rather 
to the education-professional training sector. It is through 
people's qualifications, through a complete backing of society 
for people's training that the success of our joint building of 
an European future may depend on. The success of our ability to 
compete in world markets -- that are increasingly more difficult 
for a country such as Portugal -- may also depend on this. 
  We want more backing for economic growth, more support for 
those who produce and work. Above all we want a total 
nonacceptance of the unemployment figures, with the spread of 
poverty and with the lack of safety in the streets that poverty 
helps to nurture in our country. 
  We also want greater justice in our taxes and the social 
services to which we have access, health, education, housing, 
and social security. It is the preparation of this alternative 
that we want to carry out together with Portuguese society, 
aware that it is today increasingly more needed in the country. 
[passage omitted] 
  We want to help to nurture a new hope in Portugal, a new 
confidence in our future as nation, affirmed in Europe, and 
universally, as always. 
  Allow me a last word on the abstention rate. In our opinion, 
this has penalized above all the PS. A party whose electoral 
support comes increasingly from the youth sector and the cities. 
Therefore, it is natural that there was some discrepancy between 
the opinion polls, which did not forecast it, and the final 
result that marks the extent of the Socialist victory. 
  I disagree totally with the prime minister over the meaning 
of this abstention rate. I believe an important part of this is 
connected to the disappointment among Portuguese with regard to 
political life and the way the government is being governed. I 
am not only talking about the government. I am talking about 
the institutions and the political parties themselves. 
  Therefore, I would like to reiterate here, as Dr. Antonio 
Vitorino has already done, our total commitment to a reform of 
the political system. I would like to call on the leaders of 
the other parties to collaborate with us, within the framework 
of the revision of the Constitution, toward obtaining a new 
balance between the participation of citizens and representative 
democracy, and that this new balance helps to overcome this 
relative disappointment, this relative ill at ease, and enables 
once more to reconcile the Portuguese with the functioning of 
our democratic political system. [passage omitted] 
  I would like to end by reiterating, once more, that in the 
same way the Portuguese have placed their trust in the PS, they 
can do so in the future, and that we will do out utmost to 
justify the hope that has been placed on us.

  [Text] The Socialist Party [PS] has won the elections for 
the European Parliament in Portugal. The RTP/Catholic 
University forecast says that the Socialist Party won between 35 
and 39 percent of the vote, the Social Democratic Party [PSD] 
has won between 28 and 32 percent, the Social Democratic Center 
Party [CDS] has won between 12 and 14 percent of the vote, and 
Communist-Greens coalition [CDU] has between 9.5 and 11 percent 
of the vote. 
  This means that the PS has 11 MEP's [Member of European 
Parliament], PSD has eight MEP's, CDU has three MEP's, and the 
CDS has three MEP's. We will now compare these figures with 
those of the last European elections in 1989: The PS had 28.5 
percent, the PSD had 32.7 percent, the CDS had 14.2 percent, and 
the CDU had 14.4 percent.

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez from the </F>
Spanish Socialist Workers Party headquarters in Madrid -- live] 
  [Text] I want to make a statement in the first place to say 
that according to the results known so far in these elections, 
which I think are now unchangeable, the People's Party [PP] has 
won the elections. Therefore, elections to the European 
Parliament belong to the People's Party. They are to be 
congratulated and congratulated democratically. Therefore, this 
is the first statement. I phoned PP leader Jose Maria Aznar as 
soon as these first results were known to congratulate him. 
  Second, we are awaiting the results from the elections to 
the 
Andalusian Parliament. We will be the major party, although 
with less seats. I have also congratulated Manuel Chaves [prime 
minister of the Andalusian Autonomous Government]. Third, and 
this is addressed to all of you, I want to say something. 
Twelve years ago, a little more than 12 years ago, 12 years as 
everyone knows...[pauses] we have been winning elections as the 
Socialist party. We have an extraordinarily faithful 
electorate, over 30 percent. We have to give our deepest thanks 
for its loyalty and faithfulness at moments of difficulty. I 
sincerely believe that this is a good base for recovery. We 
have time ahead of us. We have to carry out government capable 
of overcoming the two elements that I believe have had a 
negative influence in what is probably the worst moment we are 
experiencing. One of these elements, without a doubt, has been 
corruption, and the other element has been the economic crisis. 
Despite the fact that we are coming out of it, despite this, it 
is still not being noticed among the people. Therefore, there 
has been a part of the electorate that on this occasion I 
believe has abstained. It has not given us its vote and this 
has meant that we have gone down in the results. I want to give 
you all the encouragement that I feel. 
  Even if the results were not what they were, and they are 
respectable, being over 30 percent, even if they had not been 
what they have been, I repeat, I would have the fighting spirit 
to try to win the next elections as I think is right for a 
political program such as the one we represent. 
  According to the figures I have, I think that at the level 
of 
the European Union [EU], which could also be a complementary 
element, we will continue to be the largest group in the 
European Parliament, but we still have to wait. The Socialist 
and Social Democratic group will be the largest in the European 
Parliament. We also have the satisfaction that Austria has won 
its referendum by approximately two-thirds of the population, 
therefore, there is a new EU member. 
  I do not want to go on much longer. But I want to remind you 
that democratically and unreservedly I congratulate those who 
have won. We know how to win and lose elections and we are 
going to win the next elections. Therefore, take heart, you 
have worked very hard. There is a very significant part of the 
electorate that continues to give us its support at moments of 
extreme difficulty. Therefore, as is already happening, when we 
clearly begin to overcome the economic crisis the wind will blow 
in our favor. When we try and succeed in eliminating from 
public life those who take advantage of it, from wherever they 
come from, we will also improve our electoral possibilities. 
  Finally, I just want to make a personal comment. When I win 
elections, when we have won elections, and we have won many 
times, you see me a bit serious. I feel overwhelmed by the 
responsibility. Now we have lost I want to encourage you with a 
smile to try to win the next elections. It is in our power and 
we can do so. So, take heart. Do not let this work fail 
because it is for a great political program that has 
historically transformed our life and will continue to do so in 
the future. 
  Finally, I want to say something else especially to the 
press. Tomorrow morning government has to continue. I am 
absolutely prepared to give stability to the country's 
government, to try to improve the economic situation, and to 
strengthen the fight against corruption. Therefore, as from 
tomorrow, when I have to make an unavoidable trip to Colombia, 
as from tomorrow, we will again begin our work as a government 
and we will try to carry out a deeper analysis than I have just 
done as to what have been the causes, the deep causes, of this 
electoral situation, and we will try to overcome them. Have 
confidence, trust in the future, the future belongs to 
democratic socialism. Thank you.

  [Text] According to Prime Minister Esko Aho, European Union 
[EU] membership is in Finland's national interests if the 
government is able to carry through its agricultural subsidy 
program. Answering an EU interpellation by the leftist alliance 
in the Eduskunta, Aho said the Eduskunta must approve the laws 
connected with the agricultural subsidy package before the 
national referendum in the fall. According to Aho, military 
nonalignment would be the basic tenet of Finland's security 
policy even as a member of the EU. Aho emphasized that the 
outlining of joint EU foreign policy requires the approval of 
each member state when the matter is raised two years from now. 
There will also be a separate decision on joining the European 
Monetary Union by the Finnish Government and the Eduskunta. 
Motions for and against the EU have been prepared for the 
interpellation debate. 
  The Eduskunta will hold a vote of confidence in the 
government on 15 June.

That is the conclusion of a recent report in which the Gateway 
Commission analyzes Finland's opportunities to offer various 
services to foreign enterprises. The commission, headed by 
State Secretary Timo Relander, submitted its report to Foreign 
Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen on Thursday [2 June]. 
  Minister Salolainen stressed that the decision to join the 
EU 
and purposeful investment programs will be decisive for the 
future. To be outside the EU would, according to Salolainen, 
weaken Finland's position as a gateway: "The geoecostrategic 
position of our country has changed, but the geographical 
realities remain. It is clear that we would not be able to pay 
attention to Europe's growing markets as efficiently," 
Salolainen commented. "Neither is it reasonable to consider 
Finland as the only two-way gate to the East. Our intention is 
to stay as competitive as possible by offering nearness, 
know-how, and trustworthiness," Salolainen added. 
  The Gateway action program defines the following three roles 
for Finland: traffic center, business activity center, and an 
Arctic center focusing on Russia's northwest region. There is a 
population of 40 million within a 24-hour freight radius of 
Finland. The report concludes that bold investments in the 
development of infrastructure, logistics, and marketing are of 
primary importance in order to reach these markets: "Russia 
exported 165 million tonnes in 1992. Only 5 million of this 
went through Finland. Considering that the volume of Russia's 
exports is expected to grow by 100 million tonnes, we have the 
opportunity of getting a reasonable share of this shipped via 
our country," State Secretary Timo Relander said. 
  But Russian exports are not the only area to arouse future 
hopes. Britain, Germany, and the United States are the main 
targets of a campaign to attract investments to Finland, whose 
theme is "Finland in the heart of the new northern Europe." 
"Our problem was that foreign companies are completely unaware 
of Finland's potential as a direct investment target. Its 
remoteness and small markets have not attracted interest. 
Finland's population would have to be at least 10 times larger. 
But Finland has moved from its geographical outer fringe to the 
center of a new northern Europe due to the changes in its 
environment," Invest in Finland Bureau chief Nils-Christian Berg 
said. 
  On a map showing a circle containing the Nordic and Baltic 
countries plus northwest Russia, Finland is right in the center 
of that circle: "The center of gravity has moved east. The 
Nordic countries have a population of 23 million, the Baltic 
region has 8 million, and northwest Russia 44 million. Finland 
occupies a highly strategic position in the center of this 
area," Berg added. 
  He thinks the Baltic countries and Russia will, in spite of 
the risks, draw the attention of international companies, which 
are particularly interested in fast growing large-volume 
markets. Finland is not the only country to have discovered the 
St. Petersburg region. 
  "In addition, this region offers all the required resources 
of energy, minerals, and forest-based raw materials. Finland is 
the nearest developed region, right next door to these new 
markets. It offers completely new opportunities as an 
investment target. Solutions can be found in the form of 
joint-venture enterprises focusing on the Russian markets," Berg 
added. 
  This potential is becoming obvious to the Finns, but only 
few 
foreign investors have recognized it so far. The message is now 
being marketed, especially in Britain, Germany, and the United 
States. 
  The Invest in Finland Bureau operates under the Trade and 
Industry Ministry. It was founded a couple of years ago, but 
gained full operational speed a little over a year ago. The 
bureau employs a staff of six. 
  "We try to approach the foreign businesses in each country 
systematically, through the intermediary of experts. We work in 
direct cooperation with partners, not via public campaigns," 
Berg commented, but he warned against expecting fast results: 
"The preparation of investment projects takes at least three, 
most often five, years longer than their physical 
implementation. We are not publicizing projects; information 
about these is up to the companies," Berg said, adding that a 
number of projects have already been activated and that some of 
these are progressing rapidly. 
  Berg views the Genencor investment, worth over 100 million 
markkas, as a positive surprise. Another project in progress is 
the forthcoming transfer of an international consumer goods 
giant's East Europe headquarters from Vienna to Helsinki. This 
move will include production facilities. 
  "Finland is an interesting investment target. We organized 
an investment seminar together with Merrill Lynch at the end of 
April. The report released by Merrill Lynch was directly 
complimentary to Finland. Last year a similar seminar was 
arranged together with Goldman Sachs and First Boston. The 
results have shown in the form of a increase in foreign 
investments in Finnish securities," Berg added. 
  Companies presented to investors in cooperation with Merrill 
Lynch were Repola, Valmet, Outokumpu, Metra, Instrumentarium, 
and Kemira.

<F P=106> [Article by Daniel Vernet: "Russia at the Borders of the </F>
European Union"] 
  [Text] Finland's entry in the European Community presents 
new strategic problems for the West. 
  With the affiliation of Central and East European countries 
with the Western European Union (WEU), agreed upon on Monday, 9 
May, in Brussels, West Europe is widening its sphere of 
responsibility in terms of security. But there is no need to 
wait for the possible expansion of the European Union [EU] to 
the east to take into account a new strategic deal. The 
expansion now proceeding with Austria, Finland, Norway, and 
Sweden is already introducing a profound change. In fact, the 
EU, for the first time in its history, will have an extended 
common border with Russia when Finland becomes a full-fledged 
member. To be sure, there is yet another possible contact point 
between these two great entities of the Old Continent, it is on 
the Kola Peninsula, where NATO -- through the intermediary of 
Norway -- and the former USSR challenged one another for a long 
time. But the likelihood of membership in the EU is greater for 
Finland than Norway, and the hundreds of kilometers that run 
from the Nordkyn Cape to Vyborg represent an unprecedented 
geopolitical reality. Having an extended common border with 
Russia should lead the EU to think differently about its 
security policy. 
  To begin with, this reality greatly weakens the argument of 
those who, in the name of a pan-European vision including 
Russia, object to expansion of the Community to the east; 
according to them, a new demarcation line should not be drawn in 
Europe following the disappearance of the Iron Curtain. This 
refusal would be a new exclusion line leaving Russia -- and 
Russia alone -- outside the integration process. Would what is 
valid for Poland not be therefore valid for Finland? Why would a 
border between the Union and the Russian world passing over the 
Bug River be more discriminatory than the Finnish-Russian 
border? Would it not be due to Warsaw's former membership in the 
socialist camp? Which would be the equivalent of recognizing a 
special Russian right of inspection over its former satellites, 
and therefore of acknowledging a rather sweeping concept of what 
Moscow calls the "nearby foreigner." The fact remains that the 
idea of a "gray zone," belonging to neither East nor West, a 
sort of buffer zone between Europe and Russia that the Kremlin 
is sometimes tempted to maintain, has no longer the same power 
with the entry of Helsinki in the European Community. 
Undoubtedly, during the Cold War, Finland also held a position 
all its own. Often, the term "Finlandization" was used wrongly 
with a disparaging connotation to convey the neutrality of a 
country with a market economy having good neighbor relations 
with the USSR. It might have been interpreted differently: 
Without belonging to NATO, which would then have been contrary 
to that neutrality and seen as a provocation by its powerful 
neighbor, Finland benefited in a way from an unspoken guarantee 
of security on the part of the West. 
  Finland was not in the zone covered by NATO, but the latter 
would not have accepted the application of the Brezhnev doctrine 
to the former. 
  Membership in the Union is going to transform this 
guarantee; 
from unexpressed, it will become specific, and there lies the 
great geostrategic novelty linked to the existence of a common 
European-Russian border. The change will not occur in one day. 
Finland will have to reconcile its tradition of neutrality with 
its integration into West Europe. By applying for membership in 
the Union, Finland, pending a positive referendum outcome, has 
accepted all rights and duties, including the Maastricht 
Treaty's commitments pertaining to foreign policy and joint 
security. 
  But the opposite is also true. The EU makes a commitment to 
Finland by accepting its candidacy; the former offers the latter 
the same protection that is offered all its members. The joint 
defense policy ultimately implies a participation in the WEU, 
therefore the security guarantee and the aid of the other 
members as called for in Article 5 of its charter in case of 
aggression. But this guarantee itself is valid only insofar as 
it is strengthened by NATO reassurance, that is to say, in the 
final analysis, by the United States. This aspect of European 
defense policy worries Washington. Last January, the Americans 
rejected the expansion of NATO to the east and proposed instead 
the Partnership for Peace [PFP], in order, to be sure, not to 
offend the Russians, but above all, so as not to have to give 
the new states the security guarantees available to the 16 NATO 
members (Finland and Sweden signed the outline agreement 
pertaining to the PFP on 9 May). 
  As it stands, the Americans feel that the expansion of the 
EU 
and the Central European countries' plans for association with 
the WEU, launched by the French and German foreign ministers and 
implemented early this week, are equivalent to secretly creating 
new pretenders to the NATO umbrella. The Americans also feel 
that these projects are liable to ultimately leave them with a 
fait accompli. It is a difficult dilemma, for the United States 
can no more accept being forced indirectly by Europe to 
guarantee the security of new countries through an association 
with or a membership in the WEU than the Europeans can give the 
Americans a right of veto over candidates for Community 
membership. To insist on the significance of this 
European-Russian "new border" is neither to fear nor, all the 
more so, to predict troubles between Finland and Russia, that is 
to say, border incidents challenging the security of a (future) 
EU member and forcing its partners to fly to its aid. 
  Nothing can be excluded in a Europe where all the borders 
have started shifting again. There were many territorial 
conflicts between Finland and Russia prior to 1945. Yet, during 
the process of dissolution of the USSR, and despite the 
centrifugal forces working within Russia itself, the formerly 
Finnish Karelia has remained remarkably calm. 
  Everything seems to indicate that these Scandinavian borders 
should not be the first objective of a Eurocorps in the making. 
Therefore, it is less a question of existing fears than of 
questions about an important upheaval on the European scene. We 
have barely begun to measure the consequences of such an 
upheaval on a European Community built patiently over a 30-year 
period and sheltered by the Berlin Wall. It involves a new 
geography of the continent. Without waiting for the next stages, 
the current expansion shifts Europe's center of gravity toward 
the East and its zones of violence. For Helsinki is not the only 
one involved: Vienna -- another newcomer to the Union -- is 
closer to Ukraine than to the western border of Austria.

  [Text] Finland's territorial waters are to be extended. 
The government presented a bill on this to the Eduskunta today. 
Finland's territorial waters will extend to 12 nautical miles 
instead of the current 4 nautical miles. This is an attempt to 
improve the authorities' ability to control entry and exit in 
the sea areas. It is proposed that the extension of the 
territorial waters will be implemented in the Gulf of Finland so 
that there will always be a east-west open sea corridor 
measuring 3 nautical miles on the northern side of the median 
line.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  `Close as Possible' to Power Centers </H5>
  As the opponents of Norwegian European Union [EU] membership 
repeat their warnings about lost sovereignty and national 
identity, those in favor of the EU have started stressing the 
security/defense issues. 
  The daily AFTENPOSTEN on 3 May carried a guest commentary by 
Iver Neumann, head of the foreign affairs/security studies 
department at the Norwegian Institute for Foreign Affairs 
Studies (NUPI), in which he contended that neither EU membership 
nor NATO "can in and of itself determine the country's foreign 
policy course." The issue is how Norway "best can balance" its 
relationships with the three major political centers of power: 
Norway must "work hard to be as close to the EU, the United 
States, and Russia as it possibly can without alienating any of 
the parties." 
  The geopolitical picture is not the whole picture, however, 
because there are "fundamental" changes "in the distribution of 
power in the international system and in the development of new 
technology." The latter challenges are as significant as the 
geopolitical ones for Norway's choice of foreign policy. The 
international system is no longer founded on a balance of terror 
between the superpowers: The new system has a nucleus 
consisting of the "economic centers" of NAFTA, the EU, and 
Japan, with a "periphery of regional challengers such as China, 
Russia, and Iraq." 
  According to Neumann, there are three immediate 
consequences. 
First, the significance of the economic order for security 
policy. At present the EU is the nucleus of economic Europe, 
hence also of political Europe. This means that it is "a 
security imperative for all European leaders to shepherd their 
regions, nations, and states as close as possible to the center 
of Europe, i.e., Brussels." Neumann compared the European 
situation to a series of orbits: the EU superpowers as the inner 
orbit, surrounded by the other EU members in a second orbit, 
then the EEA [European Economic Area] members in a third orbit, 
and finally the Central European countries (by virtue of their 
agreements with the EU) in a fourth orbit. He pointed out that 
Norway had some special leverage in this constellation: its 
energy reserves, which, "from a Brussels perspective are all the 
more interesting since alternative sources are primarily in a 
less stable periphery -- Russia and the Middle East." 
  The second consequence of the new economic order is that 
Europe's relationship to "its challengers in the periphery" has 
become "regional." For example, Moscow's attempts at asserting 
influence in Central Europe will "clash with those of Brussels." 
  The third consequence, according to Neumann, is that 
cooperation within the Nordic region is no alternative to a 
Brussels affiliation, because such cooperation would "not 
necessarily bring the Nordic countries any closer to Brussels." 
Norway's involvement in Baltic and Barents Sea regional 
cooperation, on the other hand, has viability because the 
cooperation "begins in the contested areas, and ties are made to 
both of the rival power centers, Brussels and Moscow." (Both in 
the Arctic Barents region and in the Baltic area, the Nordic 
governments, together with the EU, WHO, and other countries and 
international bodies are working with Russia and the former 
Soviet republics in such fields as nuclear safety, pollution, 
health, and commerce.) According to Neumann, this leads to 
"confidence-building, concrete work at the local level, closer 
ties with Brussels, a dialogue with Moscow, and a better 
domestic understanding of the fact that transnational and 
supranational political mechanisms have been added to the 
international ones." Neumann called this "significant, in view 
of Norway's historical trend of isolationism and noncommitting, 
abstract internationalism." 
  Neumann pointed out that rapid advances in technology can 
have a limiting effect on a small country's defense policy. 
Regardless of what resources Norway devotes to defense, it will 
not be able to carry a full assortment of weapons: "There is no 
point in our trying to arm ourselves away from an unstable 
neighbor like Russia; we will have to find other mechanisms to 
tackle that challenge." 
  In the past, through its NATO membership, Norway has 
"probably got as close to the United States as it could possibly 
get." But the U.S.-European relationship will "weaken in the 
future because the United States no longer is as interested in 
Europe and the northern regions as it was during the Cold War." 
Militarily, the shift is "out of NATO and over to the WEU." 
  Norway's "current focusing on the EU is a consequence of the 
end of the Cold War. Its only competitor is a nascent 
isolationism." A no to the EU will still mean having to get "as 
close to Brussels as possible in as many areas as possible," nor 
are there any alternatives to Norway's present course in its 
policy toward an "increasingly regionally assertive Russia." 
<H5>  NATO Shifting to WEU </H5>
  An AFTENPOSTEN editorial on 3 May pointed out that making a 
choice on membership in the EU is making a choice on "how we 
choose to protect our national interests, not the least of which 
are our security interests." The daily pointed out that although 
there may be no "immediate, acute risk, it would be foolhardy to 
preclude that we could find ourselves in a position of extreme 
danger in the coming years." The editorial recalled the short 
span, 10 years, from the "unbridled peace optimism" of Europe in 
the late l920's to a new world war. The editorial noted the 
need to have a perspective "beyond the next two weeks," given 
the "changes now under way" in the security policy pattern in 
Europe and in Europe's relationship to the United States. 
  Because the United States "defines the EU and WEU as the 
European tools" in building a European pillar in NATO, Norway 
"does not have the choice between a North Atlantic or a European 
anchorage." 
  Norway could, from an economic point of view, manage with 
the 
EEA agreement, the paper contended, "providing we always and 
without objection adjust" to the EU's decisions. 
  In view of the "emerging pan-European security perspectives" 
Norway and the three other EU applicant countries, Finland, 
Austria, and Sweden, "need to find their place within the EU," 
the paper stated flatly. Not only is Norway "interested" in a 
common European approach to security challenges, it is "truly 
dependent" on it. As an example of the new regional approach to 
meeting challenges, AFTENPOSTEN pointed to the Barents 
Euro/Arctic project, initiated by former Foreign Minister 
Thorvald Stoltenberg and designed to "help bring much-needed 
stabilization to Russia." Such projects, the editorial 
concluded, "may become illuminating chapters in the area of 
peacekeeping, which in its time was the reason for establishing 
a European community." 
<H5>  Helping Those Who Help Themselves </H5>
  In a guest commentary in AFTENPOSTEN on 15 May, entitled "As 
If Norway's Future Knew No Danger," Army Colonel Arvid Geirulv, 
chief of the Defense Geographic-Military Service, detailed the 
debilitating effects of the military reductions in the post-Cold 
War era, decrying the political leadership's stance that it 
"could not afford more defense." The minimum military force 
determined in the last Defense Commission Paper is not being 
maintained. According to Geirulv, it is "incomprehensible" that 
"responsible authorities dare risk having to send a few, 
undertrained conscripts" into battle against an "obviously 
overpowering enemy." 
  With the U.S. reduction in forces in Europe and Norway's 
other NATO allies also cutting back, Norway "should not be 
overly optimistic" about the allies' willingness to come to its 
rescue, "especially if we have turned our back on that very 
Europe" by remaining outside the EU. Norway cannot expect 
others to rush "to help us any more than we are willing to help 
others, and, in particular, no more than we are willing to help 
ourselves." Geirulv warned that Norway must not repeat the 
pre-1940 mistake of believing that "it cannot happen here."

  [Excerpts] According to a REUTER report, in his letters to 
U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John 
Major, President Glavkos Kliridhis expressed his intention to 
resign and declare elections in October if the UN Security 
Council decides to continue pursuing the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's]. In an exclusive statement to the Cyprus 
Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC], Kliridhis refused to reveal the 
contents of the letters, but stressed that no talks should be 
held either on the CBM's or the substance of the issue because 
of Turkish intransigence. 
  Commenting on the REUTER report, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas mentioned that Kliridhis is using blackmail and bluffing 
in order to get Varosha. 
  Correspondent Dhimitrios Andreou reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Andreou] President Kliridhis was at the 
Larnaca marina today. Will he reveal the contents of the 
letters he sent to Clinton and Major? 
  [Kliridhis] I have sent letters to President Clinton and the 
British Prime Minister. Of course, these letters are related to 
the CBM's. The contents of the letters are confidential for 
now, but when the time is right they will be published. 
  [Andreou] Kliridhis said that there can be no further 
discussion on the CBM's or the substance of the Cyprus issue 
now. He stressed that measures must first be taken to convince 
us that the other side has political will. The National Council 
agreed unanimously that talks on the CBM's must not continue and 
that the substance of the issue must not be discussed now 
because the Turkish side has no political will. 
  [Kliridhis] In light of these events, our position is that 
if 
there is no significant change so that we can say that the other 
side has the political will for a solution, there is no space 
for further talks either on the CBM's or the substance of the 
issue. 
  [Andreou] Kliridhis finally said that the Government and the 
Greek Cypriot side support the UN secretary general's positions 
on intense and detailed negotiations among the UN Security 
Council permanent members, the guarantor powers, the two 
communities, and Europe. [passage omitted] 
  A REUTER bulletin from Nicosia dated 10 June mentions that 
it 
has copies of Kliridhis' letter to Major and Clinton and quotes: 
Having examined the situation carefully, I have reached the 
conclusion that if the UN Security Council decides that talks 
must continue on the CBM's, I would find it necessary to resign 
and declare presidential elections in October 1994. The new 
president will be free of the commitments that I have undertaken 
and will have to decide on new measures. 
  The previous day, the Athens newspaper ETHNOS carried a 
similar report and CyBC asked government spokesman Ioannis 
Kasoulidhis to comment on it. 
  [Kasoulidhis] I don't know of anything. 
  [Andreou] But in any case there is something.... 
  [Kasoulidhis, interrupting] I have no knowledge of the 
report 
or what you are saying. 
  [Andreou] Has the president not expressed any thoughts about 
resigning? 
  [Kasoulidhis] I have answered that I know nothing about this 
issue. 
  [Andreou] The spokesman avoided making any comment today 
either, stressing that Kliridhis' letters are confidential. [end 
recording]

  [Excerpt] President Rauf Denktas has declared that the 
Greek Cypriot Administration leader, who does not want to 
progress any further than the latest phase reached as a result 
of the goodwill demonstrated by the Turkish Cypriot side, has 
resorted to blackmail and bluffing in a bid to avoid 
responsibility. Denktas reacted to Kliridhis' letters to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major, in 
which he threatened to resign if the UN Security Council adopts 
a resolution on the continuation of the confidence-building 
measures [CBM] process. 
  Denktas pointed out that Kliridhis wants to prevent the 
facts 
from being underlined in a new report because he realizes that 
he cannot place all the blame on the Turkish Cypriot side. He 
is openly engaging in blackmail and he is bluffing, Denktas 
charged. Noting that the Greek Cypriot leader aims at taking 
possession of Maras [Varosha] and not at accepting the package, 
Denktas remarked that it is not difficult to understand why 
Kliridhis is resorting to such blackmail. 
  From the outset, the Greek Cypriots criticized Kliridhis for 
consenting to negotiate the CBM's, and Kliridhis, in turn, told 
members of the Greek Cypriot National Council to await the 
outcome of the talks and then make a decision, Denktas recalled. 
He said that Kliridhis wanted to secure a certain amount of 
maneuverability to acquire Maras, and failing that, he wanted to 
pave the way for membership in the European Union. 
  Denktas continued: Now, in his letters to Clinton and Major, 
Kliridhis has announced that if the 21 March document is not 
adopted in its present form, he will resign and will allow the 
newly elected president to decide on the CBM's without 
prejudice. Pointing out that this is the key point, Denktas 
noted that Kliridhis wants to avoid responsibility. 
  The president recalled that in his recent report, the UN 
secretary general referred to the 21 March document as a draft 
of ideas, adding that it is not sincere and constructive for 
Kliridhis to ask to sign a draft document without any change. 
For the draft to turn into a full agreement, it is necessary to 
include in the document those issues promised to the Turkish 
Cypriot side and to present the text of the agreement to the 
people as a whole. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by K. Venizelos] </F>
  [Text] The Americans are said to have leaked President 
Glavkos Kliridhis' letter to President Bill Clinton and Prime 
Minister John Major. According to I SIMERINI information, the 
American Embassy in Nicosia leaked the content of the letter, 
specifically President Kliridhis' reference that if talks on the 
CBM's [confidence-building measures] continue he would resign, 
in order to test the Cyprus Government's reaction and to record 
the amount of persistence in this warning. 
  The Cyprus Government's message with Kliridhis' warning to 
the U.S. and British Governments, who are playing a pioneering 
role these days behind the scenes for the resumption of talks on 
the CBM's, was crystal clear: We will reject a Security Council 
appeal if it decides to continue the process. This is what a 
reliable source in Nicosia has told I SIMERINI and noted that 
President Kliridhis briefed the Ambassadors of these countries 
on his intentions at the meetings he had with them last week. 
These ambassadors briefed their governments before the letter 
was sent, and at least the Americans began the leaks on this 
question from the very beginning. What did they expect to gain 
by the leaks? Through the official statements by the government, 
they would test how serious the president was about his 
resignation, or more probably, they would force him to back down 
in the face of publicity. 
  A government source in Nicosia, without confirming or 
denying 
the REUTER report on the content of Kliridhis' letter, told I 
SIMERINI that Nicosia is determined to avert a resumption of the 
talks. At the same time, it warns that if elections were held 
today, the climate to be created in public opinion would favor 
the election of hard-liners on the Cyprus issue. 
  All the government actions are based on understandings with 
the Greek Government. Greek Ambassador in Nicosia Alexandros 
Sandhis is being kept fully briefed on the developments by 
President Kliridhis, and it appears that some moves are being 
formulated jointly. Reports from Athens did not rule out the 
possibility that the Greek Government would also send warning 
letters. The statements by Karolos Papoulias, Evangelos 
Venizelos, and Yeoryios Papandreou (which he made after meeting 
Alekos Mikhailidhis) that the CBM's are dead indicate the Greek 
side's intentions and activities that will follow. 
  The British and American moves in New York and Kliridhis' 
reaction with the warning that he would resign are the climax of 
a series of developments. According to I SIMERINI information, 
when President Kliridhis recently talked with a foreign diplomat 
he said that for one year the Greek side has been saying "yes" 
despite the reaction on the domestic front. Then the foreigners 
were telling us "bravo," but now they reward Rauf Denktas' 
intransigence, President Kliridhis pointed out.

<F P=106> [Report by K. Kiriakidhis] </F>
  [Text] The American Embassy in Nicosia leaked the 
information carried by REUTER about President Glavkos Kliridhis' 
threat to resign if the Security Council proceeds with a 
decision to reinforce the confidence-building measures [CBM's] 
process. According to REUTER the threat is contained in the 
letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime 
Minister John Major. 
  This is according to I MAKHI exclusive information which 
also 
reveals the negative role of former U.S. coordinator Robert 
Lamb. The same information notes that the American Embassy's 
action tried--initially--to have people think the leak emanated 
from the Cyprus Government in order to: 
  FIRST: Be seen as a "bluff" by President Kliridhis with the 
same contents as the intentions and warning he conveyed to U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher during their recent 
telephone conversation. (The National Council was briefed at 
its meeting last Wednesday on the telephone call which was made 
at Mr. Chrisopher's initiative.) 
  SECOND: To weaken, through the publicity and dimensions that 
the issue would acquire, the dramatic tone, seriousness, 
developments, and President Kliridhis' categorical refusal to 
accept the continuation of talks on the CBM's. The same sources 
revealed to I MAKHI that the ultimate goal of this action was 
for the U.S. Government not to pay proper attention to the 
Kliridhis letter and to conceal the actions and recent handling 
by Robert Lamb and American Ambassador in Nicosia Richard 
Boucher. 
  According to reliable information I MAKHI has, which leaves 
no room for doubt, the U.S. Government and the State Department 
are COMPLETELY UNAWARE [uppercase as published] of the ways Lamb 
and Boucher handled the issue and particularly of Lamb's 
proposals made in Vienna and the promises (which are outside the 
21 March document) he gave "behind the backs" of the Greek 
Cypriot side and which Rauf Denktas now invokes and uses as a 
basis for the strengthening of the CBM's talks. 
  Moreover, it is worth stressing that the UN secretary 
general's representatives also disagree strongly with Lamb's 
promises and they have expressed their strong displeasure at the 
way that Lamb handled the issue in Vienna and the current 
approach for the future course of the Cyprus issue. 
  Meanwhile, there has not been any official reaction by the 
Cyprus Government to Kliridhis' threat to resign and call 
elections, as REUTER reported. Government spokesman Ioannis 
Kasoulidhis, despite repeated questions from journalists, 
neither denied nor confirmed the REUTER report. He confined 
himself to saying only that the contents of President Kliridhis' 
letters to the U.S. President and the British Prime Minister are 
confidential. 
  Commenting on the insistence by the Americans and the 
British 
and their efforts to continue the CBM talks, a diplomatic source 
in Nicosia told I MAKHI that they are heading in this direction 
because it suits them since it gets them out of the difficult 
position they would be in if they followed the Butrus-Ghali 
options, by which they would be compelled to condemn Denktas and 
adopt measures against him. 
  According to New York reports, during a press briefing, the 
UN secretary general's spokesmen Joe Sills and Fred Eckhard 
expressed the view that there are some hopeful signs, but they 
avoided specifying them, adding only that Mr. Gustave Feissel is 
continuing his consultations. Asked when the secretary 
general's new supplementary report will be issued, Mr. Eckhard 
said that he does not know what form the report will finally 
take (whether it will be a letter or some sort of report) but he 
revealed that another UN official Mr. Karekan [name as 
transliterated] told members of the Security Council that the 
secretary general will add to the 31 March report information 
concerning the most recent position of the Turkish Cypriot side.

  [Text] New York (A.A.)--UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali submitted a new report to the UN Security Council 
today, asking for an extension of the UN Peacekeeping Forces' 
mandate in Cyprus until the end of 1994. However, his report 
also repeats accusations against the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  It will be recalled that Butrus-Ghali, in his report dated 
30 
May, accused TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] 
President Rauf Denktas of being politically reluctant regarding 
the implementation of the "package of confidence-building 
measures" [CBM]. In his new report, he has selected the Turkish 
Armed Forces as his target. In his report on the extension of 
the UN Peacekeeping Forces' mandate, Butrus-Ghali expresses 
regret that "the Turkish military forces' approach has blocked 
the effort to have the sides withdraw from the buffer zone and 
to ban arms and ammunition in that area." He also claims that 
the problems related to access to Maras [Varosha] continue to 
exist for the same reason. Butrus-Ghali also notes that "the 
Turkish Armed Forces have refused to hold talks with officials 
of the UN Peacekeeping Forces on the withdrawal from the buffer 
zone, claiming that the matter should be resolved with the TRNC 
Government because of its political nature." 
  Butrus-Ghali's report, which has an incriminating tone, 
further says: "The failure to achieve progress on reducing 
troops on the island has caused serious anxiety. The situation 
becomes even more grave when that matter is considered together 
with the lack of political will to implement the CBM's." 
  Butrus-Ghali also refers to the rearming of the Greek 
Cypriot 
National Guard since 1988. He notes that the 1994 budget 
allocations for the purchase of arms totalled 205 million Cyprus 
pounds. 
  Regarding the extension of the UN Peacekeeping Forces' 
mandate, Butrus-Ghali says: "The presence of the UN 
Peacekeeping Forces is required for the maintenance of peace on 
the island. As far as the achievement of the targets that have 
been established by the UN Security Council is concerned, I deem 
the presence of the UN Peacekeeping Forces on the island 
essential." Explaining that he has contacts with the sides 
concerned on the matter, Butrus-Ghali says that he will inform 
the UN Security Council on the outcome of his contacts. 
  The UN Peacekeeping Forces in Cyprus are composed 1,218 men, 
1,184 of whom are military personnel. The force is made up of 
contingents from Argentina, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, 
Hungary, Ireland, Britain, and Australia.

<F P=106> ["Text" of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' reaction to </F>
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's second report on 
Cyprus on 10 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Begin Denktas recording] Undoubtedly, the TRNC 
[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] Government will assess the 
esteemed UN secretary general's report and give the necessary 
reply to it. I wish to outline the following: The report 
briefly referred to the Greek Cypriot side's arms. However, it 
failed to mention that the Greek Cypriot side has a strike force 
of nearly 100,000 men -- 80,000 of them in the reserves. The 
remaining part of that force is made up of Greek Cypriot and 
Greek military units. 
  Meanwhile, the report said that some 30,000 Turkish troops 
are based in north Cyprus. In a strange approach, it compared 
the number of the Turkish troops with the population in north 
Cyprus and described the situation as the most intense military 
fortification in the world. That description alone indicates 
how the esteemed UN secretary general views the problem. 
  The Turkish troops have not arrived to quarrel with the 
Turkish population. They are there to defend Cyprus, and the 
Turkish Cypriots, against the Greek Cypriot military forces that 
wish to eliminate the Turkish Cypriot population. They defend 
the peace in Cyprus. 
  As I have already mentioned, the Greek Cypriot side is 
capable of organizing an army of 100,000 men in a short period. 
The Greek Cypriots are in the process of allocating naval 
facilities and an air base to Greece. However, the esteemed UN 
secretary general has ignored all that. 
  Another point, which has drawn my attention, is the UN 
secretary general's accusation that the Turkish troops have 
created problems in the efforts to have military units in 
certain border points withdrawn. He noted in his report that 
Turkish troops informed the UN officials that they should 
contact the Turkish Cypriot authorities because the matter is of 
a political nature. The Turkish troops cannot be blamed. They 
only explained the situation in north Cyprus. They informed the 
UN officials that the matter should be discussed with the 
politicians in the north and that they would comply with the 
instructions they would receive on the withdrawal of troops. 
However, the esteemed UN secretary general, who acts on behalf 
of the UN Security Council, does not wish to recognize the 
Turkish Cypriot authorities. Consequently, he has not contacted 
us on the matter. He has done that deliberately. So, he has 
been unable to pursue the UN Security Council's proposal on the 
withdrawal of troops from the confrontation line. We ask that 
they recognize the regime in north Cyprus, agree that we exist, 
and hold talks with us. They cannot achieve anything without 
holding talks with us. 
  That is what I wish to say at this point. The TRNC 
Government will assess the situation and give the necessary 
reply. 
  Another point is the UN secretary general's complaint that 
we 
have converted the St. Barnabas Church into a museum. I have 
found that very strange because the Greek Cypriots have 
destroyed 117 mosques in the past. However, no reference has 
been made to that at all. We have been trying to preserve the 
unused Greek Cypriot churches as much as we can. Furthermore, 
we have been trying to use them in an appropriate way. 
Unfortunately, they have complained even about that. 
  Considering all that, we shall protest against any complaint 
from the UN secretary general on the question of the churches in 
north Cyprus if he fails to recall the fate of the 117 mosques. 
We have lost 117 mosques. In view of that, we want that matter 
to be continually stressed. We lost many of our cemeteries. We 
also want that to be stressed. All this indicates the stand of 
the two communities against each other. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, who left 
Athens this morning for UN Headquarters, will begin 
consultations in New York on the Cyprus issue. Mr. Mikhailidhis 
will have contacts with UN Security Council members and will 
meet with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on Thursday 
[16 June]. 
  Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will also be 
visiting New York and Mr. Mikhailidhis will have a meeting with 
him to coordinate actions. Mr. Mikhailidhis will also have 
contacts in Washington with leading U.S. State Department 
officials and with members of Congress. [passage omitted] 
Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis has stressed that the 
role of the five Security Council permanent members is to 
strengthen the UN secretary general's efforts and not to be a 
substitute for him. 
  Responding to a correspondent's question on Rauf Denktas' 
demand that the Robert Lamb ideas be incorporated into the 21 
March document, Mr. Kasoulidhis said that there cannot be any 
Lamb ideas and pointed out that, according to the secretary 
general's mandate of good offices, those who can submit ideas 
and discuss ideas at the negotiating table are the secretary 
general and his representatives.

  [Text] According to updated information acquired by the 
security authorities, it appears that the murder of the two 
Turkish Cypriots in Stavrokonos village is the work of the 
Turkish Secret Services. 
  Based on this information, it appears that the crime was 
carried out by people who were acting on the orders of the 
Turkish Secret Services. One of the victims, (Ozker Tufansu), 
was a major witness for the Republic of Cyprus to overturn 
claims by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' regime that 22 
Turkish Cypriots who were living in the free areas had been 
brutally mistreated by the police. Tufansu, who was in the free 
areas, fled to the occupied areas but later returned. Ten days 
before his assassination, he revealed Turkish activities to the 
police. A few days ago, two deserters who were soldiers at the 
Attila line [the buffer zone] came to the free areas because 
they said they could not tolerate the occupation regime's 
suppression. 
  Approximately 400 Turkish Cypriots live in the free areas 
today and 180 of them are deserters.

  [Text] The official visit of Foreign Minister Stanislav 
Daskalov to the Swiss Confederation has ended. For more 
details, we have contacted Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko 
Vlaykov, who is accompanying Mr. Daskalov, in Bern: 
  [Begin Vlaykov recording] The visit could be described as 
very successful because our bilateral relations and the 
prospects of developing them was thoroughly reviewed with 
Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti. 
  The two ministers noted with satisfaction the ascending 
development of bilateral relations and the significance they 
attribute to conducting a regular political dialogue. 
  Special attention was devoted to specific aspects of 
developing financial-economic cooperation between Bulgaria and 
the Swiss Confederation. In this context, the Bulgarian side 
stressed its high assessment of the assistance that Switzerland 
renders to Bulgaria in implementing the democratic reforms in 
the country. This assistance is in the form of financial and 
technical aid and contributes toward the country's balance of 
payments. 
  Mr. Cotti stressed the great progress marked in Bulgaria in 
recent years in restoring the functions of the democratic 
system. The possibility of implementing specific joint projects 
was also discussed. The prospects for intensifying 
technological cooperation in various areas are very good. 
  It should also be mentioned that Mr. Cotti highly assessed 
Bulgaria's consistent position on the crisis in the former 
Yugoslavia and stressed the importance that Switzerland 
attributes to Bulgaria's policy in the Balkans as a stabilizing 
factor in the region. 
  Minister Daskalov was also received by President Otto Stich. 
The readiness of the two countries to intensify bilateral 
cooperation was reiterated in the ensuing talk. [end recording]

  [Text] What are Washington's intentions toward Greece 
regarding its relations with Turkey and the problem with Skopje 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]? 
  This question is becoming particularly significant at a time 
when a dialogue with Ankara is being manipulated and U.S. 
Presidential envoy Matthew Nimetz has begun a new round of 
contacts in Athens and Skopje. 
  According to reliable information ELEVTHEROTIPIA received 
from official lips, the current U.S. position is as follows: 
  1. Relations with Turkey. It is necessary to break the ice. 
Although "Attila's" [the Turkish troops in Cyprus] presence in 
Cyprus is a fact, the two countries can begin meetings and reach 
agreements on secondary issues (tourism for example). This will 
make bilateral relations easier and will benefit both countries. 
It will also remove a factor of tension in the Balkans. 
(Regarding the Cyprus issue, the United States admits that in 
the past few years it has more or less "forgotten" it and it is 
not among the top issues of concern). 
  2. The Skopje Issue. The problem focuses on the name issue. 
The United States considers all the rest--symbols, 
constitution--as subsidiary. It stresses emphatically that both 
sides must show flexibility [previous word in English]; but 
because Greece is the strongest, richest, and most stable 
country in the Balkans, it should be the one "to make the first 
step." 
  In addition to the above "advice," the United States 
stresses 
that in no case should Greece consider it an alternative to 
relations with the European Union [EU]. It stresses: "We are 
friends with Greece and all of the EU member states." 
  The United States implies that it does not make concessions 
to any country, especially Greece. 
  This "advice" was expressed after--and obviously 
during--U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's meeting with Greek Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou in Washington.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today noted 
that the problem in the Aegean can be pinpointed to violations 
by Turkish planes, violation of air-traffic rules, and 
violations of Greek national airspace. Venizelos said that U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher's position is an old U.S. 
position, adding: Our country's position, however, depends on 
national sovereignty and the need to defend the defensive 
region. Venizelos stressed: Greece always acts defensively.

and to our special correspondent Foivos Karzis, Turkish Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin said that he considers the protection of 
the Ecumenical Patriarchate as guaranteed since it is a Turkish 
institution. Cetin avoided responding to the question of

<F P=106> [Report by Dina Vayena] </F>
  [Excerpts] "What would we do with military training camps 
in Greece or any other European country? The existence of such 
camps would only create problems for the host country as well as 
for our relations with that specific country. We have many 
military camps in Kurdistan to train our people and we do not 
need any in Europe." The military pursuits of the National 
Liberation Front of Kurdistan [ERNK] are aimed at upgrading 
(unofficial) diplomatic relations with Europe and a simultaneous 
escalation of military operations in southeastern Turkey and 
northern Iraq, or northwestern Iraq as Kurdish autonomists call 
the region. Gani Yilmaz, the ERNK's official in charge of 
Europe, made it clear during our discussion. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Improvement With the West and Victory </H5>
  Yilmaz said the noticeable improvement of the ERNK's 
relations with the West, the military successes of the Kurds 
against the Turkish Army, and the escalating economic crisis in 
Turkey--the successful PKK [Kurdish Worker's Party] attacks 
against the country's tourism for the second consecutive year 
have contributed to the economic crisis--have forced the Turkish 
Government to react hastily. He said: ``When there is talk 
about supposed victories of the security authorities in 
Kurdistan and military camps in Greece, you must explain it with 
the orgy of propaganda put out by the mass media that is 
directed by the Turkish Government. 
  ``With German support, Turkey is trying to increase its 
nationalist rhetoric against the Kurdish people and Greece, both 
in the country and abroad. At the same time, problems are 
raised with the Muslim minority in Thrace and the Greek minority 
in Albania, especially after the recent visits of Albanian 
officials to Turkey.'' 
<H5>  U.S. and Germany's Load </H5>
  Personally, Yilmaz believes that, although Turkey us 
struggling to get the U.S. "go ahead" to exploit Iraqi oil in 
the pipeline that begins in Iraq and ends in the 
Mediterranean--in order to improve its failing economy--it will 
soon become an unbearable load for its great allies, the United 
States and Germany. 
  ``Turkey will continue to weaken as long as war in Kurdistan 
and the economic crisis continue. The United States and Germany 
will seriously consider if they are in a position to carry this 
weight for long. 
  ``Turkey may have currently lost its role as NATO's southern 
flank, but it will never stop searching for a role in the 
Balkans and Caucasus. I am afraid, however, that deep down the 
United States is searching for causes to intensify the 
Greek-Turkish dispute so that it can play the role of a mediator 
according to its own conditions. 
  You, the Greeks, speak about a Turkish threat and that you 
belong to the European Union [EU] and NATO. So, I wonder, is it 
the EU and NATO or the PKK guerrillas that will put an end to 
this threat?'' 
<H5>  U.S. Must Commit Itself </H5>
  Yilmaz's conclusion is: ``Greece must not be moved by the 
Turkish accusations against it but must play a more dynamic role 
for the resolution of the Kurdish issue through Europe. 
  ``The United States must document what it believes to be 
correct for our people and we are ready to discuss it. If the 
United States wants to propose a solution to this issue, and if 
it really means it, we will accept its conditions.''

  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou gave a television 
interview to Antenna [private radio and television network] 
yesterday and referred to the improvement in the climate of 
Greek-Turkish and Greek-Albanian relations following the recent 
contacts by Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. 
  The prime minister said that the government will insist on 
the preliminary conditions it has set for lifting the embargo 
against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] but he did not rule out the possibility of the 
issue being resolved before this autumn. 
  Referring to the economy, he ruled out the implementation of 
new economic measures until the end of the year and expressed 
his optimism in terms of a recovery of the economy. 
  Finally, Mr. Papandreou said that a government reshuffle 
will 
take place after the end of the Greek presidency of the European 
Union but did not want to talk about his possible move to assume 
the presidency of the country.

  [Text] On the last day of the preelection period, Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou appeared optimistic that a solution 
will be found to the issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] before the autumn. 
  The prime minister told [television station] Antenna "I know 
that elections will be held there (Skopje) sometime this fall, 
but, I believe there is a possibility of closing the issue 
before the fall. Allow me to keep to myself the reasons for 
this belief." Papandreou appeared to be attributing particular 
significance to the upcoming meeting between Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias and international mediator Cyrus Vance in New 
York. 
  The prime minister also appeared optimistic about the 
development of our country's relations with Albania and Turkey. 
He said that yesterday Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi 
asked to meet Papoulias, adding: "There is a possibility--not a 
certainty, just possibility--that the climate will change." He 
made it clear that the meeting will be held only when we are 
"satisfied that the rights of the Greek minority are being 
respected." 
  Papandreou described the meeting between the Greek and 
Turkish foreign ministers in Istanbul as positive because, as he 
said, Papoulias "was given the impression that the artificially 
shrill tone of the tension may begin be abating." He stressed 
that Greece wants good relations with Turkey, which "has 
significant domestic difficulties and wants to divert its people 
somewhere else." He added that this is why Turkey recently 
resorted to creating artificial tension in our bilateral 
relations. 
  Referring to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
suggestion that Greece disarm its planes when they fly over the 
Aegean, Papandreou noted that Greece is responsible for the 
Athens FIR [Flight Information Region], which is being violated 
by Turkish airplanes. He said: "If we were entering Turkey's 
airspace with aircraft that were equipped for maneuvers or 
anything else, then Turkey would be justified in speaking about 
a violation of its own airspace." He stressed that the problem 
is due to Turkish violations of Greek airspace. 
  The prime minister showed that he does not believe that the 
United States has a single policy toward Greece, and made a 
clear distinction between U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
Christopher. 
  Papandreou reiterated that the government reshuffle will not 
be extensive, and he congratulated Justice Minister Yeoryios 
Kouvelakis, Health Minister Dhimitrios Kremastinos, and 
Konstandinos Laliotis, the Environment, Town Planning, and 
Public Works minister, for the work they have done, making it 
clear that they will not be replaced. He avoided commenting on 
ministers' disputes or statements. 
  He said he does not believe in a collective PASOK 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement] leadership after him, adding: 
"I believe a pyramid is unavoidable." He reiterated that the 
next PASOK prime minister will be elected by the party's 
congress and that he will take a position himself. He 
criticized New Democracy [ND] Chairman Miltiadhis Evert because 
"he supported the drachma with words but actually undermined it 
by saying that the state would not have enough to pay pensions." 
He recalled that ND helped Sali Berisha become Albania's 
president. 
<H5>  With Vance </H5>
  The talks between Greece and Skopje, which will be held at 
foreign ministerial level with Vance's help, may not begin 
before 16 June. According to relevant statements by the UN 
spokesman, there may be a short delay in the talks; Vance 
recently said the talks would resume "around 13 June." 
  Last week, U.S. envoy Matthew Nimetz visited Athens and 
Skopje, essentially preparing the climate for the New York talks.

  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has described as 
wretched and shameful the rumors that circulated a few hours 
before the beginning of the European Parliament elections. 
According to the rumors, he is allegedly facing a health 
problem. 
  Mr. Papandreou also pointed out that such rumors are trotted 
out before every election showdown and stressed that those who 
start these rumors should be ashamed.

  [Excerpts] Greece declares categorically that it will not 
disavow its sovereign rights in the Aegean. The Greek position 
was outlined by Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who has 
returned from Istanbul. On the possibility of a 
Papandreou-Ciller meeting, Athens will discuss it only if a good 
climate is created in the two countries' relations. Our 
correspondent Foivos Karzis has the following report: 
  [Begin recording] [Karzis] Greece has the right to defend 
its 
sovereign rights. This is Athens' reply to the interventions by 
partners and allies in Greek-Turkish relations. A 
Papandreou-Ciller meeting is possible only if there is enough 
improvement in the bilateral climate. Mr. Papoulias was 
categorical when he commented today on the statement made by 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher yesterday. 
  [Papoulias] I will repeat what I have told Mr. Christopher. 
Of course, what Mr. Christopher said I will convey to the prime 
minister. This is natural. However, regarding my response to 
Mr. Christopher -- first, that it is a matter of Greek-Turkish 
relations; second, if Turkish aircraft did not violate our 
airspace the problem would not exist; and third, I added that it 
is Greece's sovereign right to defend its national sovereign 
rights. 
  [Karzis] German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel also called 
for 
a detente in the Greek-Turkish crisis but he avoided taking 
sides. [passage omitted] 
  [Karzis] However, the Papoulias-Cetin meeting yesterday 
seems 
to be creating a prerequisite for detente. 
  [Papoulias] As I also said yesterday, this would be 
desirable 
so long as a different climate is created;, we also agreed with 
Mr. Cetin that the tone of the rhetoric should be lowered, that 
we must try to developed a different climate in the 
Greek-Turkish relations. Of course, the culmination of this 
course would be a possible Ciller-Papandreou meeting. 
  [Karzis] The foreign minister was also clear about Greece's 
position on the Bosporus straits [Istanbul Bogazi] as Turkey is 
trying to create obstacles in the free passage of ships. Mr. 
Papoulias said: Greece insists on the principle of free 
navigation in the straits. [end recording] 
  The Greek foreign minister arrived in Ioannina a short time 
ago where he discussed in more detail his contacts in Istanbul. 
Our correspondent Yeoryios Kirousis has the following report: 
  [Begin recording] [Papoulias] Greek-Turkish relations need a 
different climate that would lead us to more stable relations 
with Turkey. 
  [Kirousis] Upon his return to Ioannina from Istanbul this 
evening, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias expressed the hope 
that Greek-Turkish relations would enter a more stable climate. 
The Greek foreign minister also discussed the Patriarchate's 
security in Turkey. 
  [Papoulias] The meetings I had were a very good opportunity 
to raise the Patriarchate issue. These meetings were very 
important, and I asked all my interlocutors to do what is proper 
for the Patriarchate's security. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What about the Cyprus issue? 
  [Papoulias] I think that my most important statement in 
Istanbul was that of the confidence-building measures having 
died because of Rauf Denktas' behavior as well as because of 
Ankara's tolerance. 
  [Kirousis] Referring to his meeting in Turkey with his 
Albanian counterpart Alfred Serreqi, Mr. Papoulias stressed that 
Albania's policy with regard to European integration is 
neglecting respect for human rights and international rules of 
behavior. Mr. Papoulias said: Greece wants good relations with 
Albania but the neighboring country should also have the same 
intentions. 
  [Papoulias] I repeated to Mr. Serreqi once again that our 
desire is to have good relations with Albania. However, it 
depends on the Albanian Government's behavior, on respect for 
the rights of the Greek minority, and on the abandoning of a 
fruitless and provocative policy which has been followed until 
now with regard to the Greek minority in Albania. [end 
recording]

  [Text] There was a barrage of explosions last night in the 
center of Athens. Specifically, within 15 minutes at around 
midnight homemade explosive devices went off in a school bus 
from the Kostas Yitonas educational institute at the 
intersection of Skiros and Evelpidhes Streets in Kipseli [Athens 
suburb], at a refreshment shop on Andrianos Street in Plaka 
[Athens district], and outside the Thivai textile mill on 
Kapnitareas Street. 
  A very strong explosion also took place at 0230 today at the 
intersection of Vasilissis Sofias and (Iridhanos) Streets, 
destroying a small, white truck with the registration No. YZ8660. 
  The Antiauthority Battle [Andiexousiastiki Pali] 
organization 
made a telephone call to a private radio station claiming 
responsibility only for the first explosion.

<F P=106> [Report by Kenan Akin: "Kiev Notes: Demirel's Worries"] </F>
  [Text] No matter who says what, Demirel has undergone a 
major transformation since becoming president. A brand new 
"President Demirel" has supplanted the former Demirel, who was a 
fault-finder, prejudiced, and had a passion for trivia. 
  This new brand of Demirel, who has supplanted Suleyman Bey, 
is no longer looking at events on a daily basis. He also gives 
the impression that he is sorry about certain things he said in 
the past. Furthermore, we have a Demirel who, if not a replica 
of the late Ozal, makes us not miss the latter. In protecting 
Turkey's interests, Demirel commands an excellent assessment and 
grasp of its rights as regards its neighbors and of the 
international situation. 
  President Demirel has clearly identified his country's 
internal and external enemies. 
  He realizes that Turkey is located in a very dangerous zone, 
and he is capable of making a serious assessment of the 
instability in this zone. 
  Among Demirel's ideas is the desire to live in peace with 
our 
neighbors and the world within the existing national borders, 
but he is also the first among those who know that this is not, 
and will not be, at all easy. 
  Just like Chief of General Staff Dogan Gures, Demirel too 
knew from the very start that "Russia is a threat," and he is 
not afraid to state this openly. Again, none but Demirel can 
assess Greece's position so well. Demirel, who is deeply 
concerned that Turkey is virtually encircled, is making 
calculations on how to coexist in this delicate situation. 
  Vigilance and care not to get involved in a "hot" 
entanglement have become Demirel's preoccupation. 
  As a journalist covering Demirel's visit to Poland, Egypt, 
and Ukraine since he became president, I felt the excitement of 
discovering these concerns. Truly, President Demirel sees to it 
that Turkey does not get involved in clashes and does not suffer 
injustice. Notwithstanding his "balanced" statements and 
behavior, he is seeking new friendships and strategies. 
  Demirel's worries are prompting the search for ways out the 
situation and long-term political investments. The visit to 
Ukraine and Moldova was the product of such a thinking.

<F P=106> [Report by Kenan Akin: "Kishinev Notes"] </F>
  [Text] The views expressed in my notes from Kiev under the 
headline "Demirel's Worries" were "confirmed" just a few hours 
after filing them. Among the president's deep worries was also 
the "premonition" that Turkey might face great dangers over the 
longer period. For that reason, long-term policies, rather than 
daily ones, are being formulated. 
  Demirel desires to establish a balance by trying to contain 
the "danger belt" surrounding our country with a new "security 
belt." 
  As regards Demirel's desires, it could be "theoretically 
argued that there always existed a potential" of threat, or a 
feeling of being under threat; or, it could be recalled that 
efforts to formulate such a "security concept" also existed in 
the past. However, the revival of the idea of a "security belt" 
with the participation of Saudi Arabia and Ukraine should be 
regarded as an important development in the region. 
<H5>  U.S. Supported It in 1980's </H5>
  This new strategy, which was announced by Demirel during an 
impromptu conversation, is bound to be an important "phase" in 
ensuring peace and prosperity in the region. It should not be 
forgotten that this new international restructuring, which could 
also be described as a "security umbrella," would be supported 
by the United States. This is because long-standing U.S. ties 
with Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey have laid the 
"foundation" for such an important step. In this way, the 
United States will "secure" the Middle East, particularly the 
oil routes. 
  The various dimensions of this new development--which is 
tantamount to establishing control over Russia above all, as 
well as over Iran, Iraq, Syria, and the future Palestinian 
state--will gradually become apparent in the near future. 
  The dimensions of this "security belt were examined during 
Demirel's flight from Kiev to Kishinev. [quotation marks as 
published] 
  By the way, Demirel's decision to take a higher profile on 
the international political scene henceforth is already evident.

<F P=106> [Report by Mehmet Ali Citak] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan has 
supported Chief of General Staff General Dogan Gures' statement 
that "Russia is a major threat." 
  Golhan said Russia, which is experiencing the travails of 
transition to democracy and a free market economy, is unable to 
tolerate those states that gained their independence after 
remaining under Russian control for 70 years. 
  In a statement to YENI GUNAYDIN, National Defense Minister 
Mehmet Golhan indicated that it would be very difficult to say 
that the Russian Federation has endorsed the newly independent 
states. Recalling that this was the impression he got during his 
visit to Russia and during the NATO conference on 24 and 25 May 
in Brussels, Golhan said: 
<H5>  "It Has Assumed an Air of Big Brother" </H5>
  "Russia has assumed the air of `I am your big brother, I am 
the leader of the CIS, you line up behind me, let me provide 
military and other assistance to you and establish bases 
vis-a-vis the small states. As such, Dogan Gures' statement is 
correct if we assess the situation from Turkey's angle. 
  "Russian Defense Minister Grachev said something like this 
during the NATO meeting: `We need to send more troops to 
Transcaucasia.' I replied: `You might like to send troops, but 
will the independent states there not get worried by that?' He 
replied: `There are bilateral agreements. I am sending the 
troops at their request. Besides, the West has turned its 
attention on Bosnia-Herzegovina and is sending troops there. It 
is sending no troops elsewhere.' Yes, this is correct. He also 
added: `I am sending troops to Georgia and Azerbaijan. If the 
West wants, it could also send troops. It could even send 
commanders and I will place my troops under their command.' 
Although there is some truth in this, what could be said with 
certainty is that even if the Russian Federation desists from 
exerting pressure on these countries by taking advantage of 
internal conflicts and friction, it is trying to subjugate them 
under the guise of troop deployment. Therefore, the existence 
of [Russian] troops there is not suitable to Turkey. These are 
independent states and they themselves must solve their own 
military and democratic problems. 
<H5>  "The West Is Spoiling Them Too Much" </H5>
  National Defense Minister Golhan also indicated that there 
is 
the worry that faced with economic difficulties, such as 1,000 
percent inflation, Russia might redirect its attention abroad 
and that the former Communist Party will gain further strength 
if things do not develop as the people wish. Stressing that 
such a development will create major difficulties for Russia in 
its present democratic appearance and in its attainment of 
desired objectives, Golhan said: "The West is quite indulgent 
toward them. We often tell the West: `You spoiled them too 
much.' This is a fact." 
  Remembering that we share a 500-year history with Russia and 
that the ties have always been friendly, Golhan said that at 
present there is no problem but that it is not possible to 
predict future intentions. 
<H5>  UN Umbrella for the Troops </H5>
  Asked "what will happen if Russia becomes more active in 
Azerbaijan," Golhan replied: "We discussed these matters with 
the Russian defense minister. We told him that if there is a 
need to send troops then this should be done under the UN 
umbrella. At least they requested CSCE and UN observers. If 
troops are to be dispatched, then this should be done not on the 
basis of bilateral agreements but under the UN umbrella."

<F P=106> [Report by Sezai Sengun: "Joint Action by PKK and ASALA" -- </F>
place names as published] 
  [Text] Ankara--Acting on information that the Workers Party 
of Kurdistan [PKK] terrorists in Armenia are preparing to 
infiltrate into Turkey, officials have placed the security 
forces in Kars, Ardahan, and Igdir Provinces on a state of 
alert. Meanwhile, the 3d Army units have intensified Turkey's 
security measures along the Armenian border. 
  According to an intelligence report submitted to the 
National 
Security Council, the PKK terrorists and the ASALA [Armenian 
Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] militants are 
cooperating in carrying out joint activities against Turkey. 
The report outlined the locations of the PKK camps in Armenia 
as follows: 
  1. Mirak, Elegiz, Reya Taze, Shengavit, Derik, Suphan, 
Cumusvan, Amri Taze, and Senger in Aragaz District. 
  2. Sorik, Hako, Tellik, and Baysiz in Talin District. 
  3. Ferik in Echmiadzin District. 
  4. Samirin in Ashtarak District. 
  The report said the PKK terrorists train in those villages 
and organize armed exercises from time to time. It also said 
that they are strongly supported by the local people. The 
report stressed: "It is believed that the PKK terrorists and 
ASALA members will organize joint attacks against Turkey. The 
Kars, Ardahan, and Igdir Provinces, which have a common border 
with Armenia, are cautioned to take the necessary measures and 
maintain a state of vigilance." 
  The report said that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is 
personally 
maintaining his organization's relations with Armenia and that 
the Armenian officials have been informed of and support the PKK 
activities.

  [Text] Salah al-Din, Iraq, June 12 (AFP) -- Turkey has 
started closing its border to Iraq to Turkish Kurds to prevent 
them from fleeing to Iraqi Kurdistan, a UNHCR official said here 
Saturday [10 June]. 
  "People from Turkey have told us that the Turkish army has 
begun cordoning off the border region to stop a new exodus," 
Ayman Ghrabyah, a Jordanian official of the High Commissioner of 
Refugees in Iraqi Kurdistan, told AFP. 
  Thousands of Turkish Kurds have fled fighting in southeast 
Turkey between government forces and the separatist Kurdistan 
Workers' Party (PKK) over the past months to settle in northern 
Iraq. 
  Ghrabyah said the daily number of refugees from Turkey had 
recently diminished but described the trend as "not very 
significant." 
  "Eight people were killed Friday when Turkish artillery 
shelled a group of refugees about to cross the border," 
according to the Democratic Party of Kurdistan which is in 
control of northern Iraq. 
  The attack was seen as another bid by Turkish authorities to 
stop would-be refugees. 
  The UNHCR official did not confirm the report. 
  Turkish officials accused the PKK last month of 
masterminding 
the exodus of thousands of Kurdish civilians from Turkey to 
northern Iraq to make "the international public believe that 
Kurds were fleeing Turkish oppression." 
  On Tuesday, the Turkish government approved a four-month 
extension effective July 19 to the state of emergency introduced 
in southeastern and eastern Turkey in July 1987. 
  These regions are the principle fighting grounds of Kurdish 
rebels in a conflict with the Turkish authorities that has left 
more than 12,900 dead in the past 10 years.

<F P=106> [Report by Hakki Erdem and Evren Deger: "Agri and Tendurek </F>
Mountains Will Be Declared Restricted Areas"] 
  [Text] Ankara--In accordance with the measures that are 
being taken against the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK], Agri 
and Tendurek Mountains will be declared "restricted military 
areas" and people will be prohibited from settling there. 
Minister of National Defense Mehmet Golhan has said the Council 
of Ministers will approve the new measure in the next few days. 
The villages on the two mountains will be moved, and anyone who 
enters the two areas will be fired on. The measure will provide 
for the establishment of a kind of buffer zone against the PKK 
militants who may try to infiltrate into Turkey from Iran, 
Armenia, and the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. 
  The National Security Council [NSC] met a few days ago to 
assess the intensified PKK activities on Agri and Tendurek 
Mountains and the opportunities the PKK militants have to 
infiltrate into Turkey from the neighboring countries and take 
up positions on the heights in these two regions. Considering 
the requests of the security forces, the NSC agreed that the 
Agri and Tendurek Mountains will be declared "restricted 
military areas." The NSC has conveyed its decision to the 
Government. Mehmet Golhan said the Council of Ministers will 
decide on the matter in the next few days. He also said the 
decision to declare the two mountains restricted areas will be 
put into effect this fall. Stressing that it will be aimed at 
obstructing PKK activities among the citizens and the nomadic 
tribes in the two areas, Golhan asserted: "The declaration of 
restricted areas will apply only to Agri and Tendurek Mountains. 
Several villages will be moved in accordance with the new 
measure. No one will be allowed to enter the two areas. We 
shall than be able to control the PKK's activities with no 
difficulty." 
  Some 50 villages will be moved when Agri and Tendurek 
Mountains are declared restricted areas. Some 10,000 people who 
live in villages such as Binkaya, Yukarisek, Tepeli, Uzunyol, 
Tuzla, Ortulu, and Sankaya will be transferred to areas close to 
larger towns. Work is underway to establish the location of the 
new settlements. Appropriate areas are being selected from among 
the public-owned lands. Private property may also be 
nationalized for that purpose if necessary. Meanwhile, nomadic 
tribes will not be allowed to enter the two restricted areas 
during summer. Although the Council of Ministers has not yet 
adopted a decision on the matter, it has been reported that 
measures have already been taken to prevent the nomadic tribes 
from moving into the two areas. The measures have been put into 
effect by the governors in the region in accordance with a 
circular they received from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
  A buffer zone will be established on Turkey's border with 
Iran, Armenia, and Nakhichevan to prevent the PKK militants from 
infiltrating into our country. The security forces will be 
instructed to fire on any unauthorized person who enters the 
restricted areas. Thus, one of the important routes the PKK 
militants use to infiltrate into Turkey will be sealed off.

<F P=106> [Report by Evren Deger: "Hizballah Members Use Mosques as </F>
Cells"] 
  [Text] Ankara--It has been established that the Hizballah 
members in Turkey have selected the mosques to camouflage their 
organization and activities. It has also been established that 
the Hizballah organization secures the funds it needs from the 
donations made to the mosques, the charges for Koranic courses, 
and the fees paid for Koranic recitations and requiems for the 
deceased. It also selects its recruits from among the students 
who attend the Koranic courses and fundamentalist individuals 
who live in the organization's boarding houses. 
  The operations that have been carried out against the 
Hizballah organization, which has become known for the 
unresolved crimes in southeastern Anatolia, have recently begun 
to yield results. The Diyarbakir State Security Court has 
established that the Hizballah has selected the mosques as its 
individual centers. Meanwhile, the Turkish Grand National 
Assembly Commission on Unresolved Crimes has decided to ask the 
Directorate of Religious Affairs to inform the commission on 
Hizballah's organization plan. The commission will meet today 
to be briefed by one of the directorate's officials on how 
Hizballah uses the mosques to get organized and the measures 
that have been taken against its activities. 
  The indictments made by the Diyarbakir State Security Court 
Prosecutor's Office have outlined in detail Hizballah's 
objectives, the plan it applies to get organized, and the 
methods it uses to acquire funds and recruit new militants. The 
indictments 1994/309 and 1994/318, which have been drawn up 
against the militants arrested by the security forces in their 
recent operations, disclosed that the Hizballah organization 
appeared on the scene for the first time in al-Biqa' Valley in 
1982. It adopted the model of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
The indictments said the Hizballah is sympathetic not only to 
the followers of the Shiite sect but also to those of the 
Hanafi, Shafi'i, and Maliki orders. They described that 
organization as having a "heterogeneous" structure. 
  The indictments noted that one objective of the Hizballah 
organization is to establish a theocratic Kurdish State in 
several provinces in eastern and southeastern Turkey. Regarding 
that organization's structure, the indictments outlined the 
following: "It has been established that the person responsible 
in each mosque describes the militants as the `mosque 
community;' the militants are recruited from among those who 
attend the mosques and the students who follow the Koranic 
courses; the religious training given to the militants under the 
guise of `religious discussions' is aimed at informing them of 
the structure and functions of a fundamentalist state; the 
Hizballah has organized itself in mosques in several provinces 
and districts; the head of a Hizballah committee in a mosque is 
named as the `person in charge of that mosque' and he is also in 
charge of the area where that mosque is located; the Hizballah 
militia are named as `community members;' a strict hierarchy 
system and discipline exists among the militants; the 
organization maintains continuity; and the person in charge of 
the largest mosque in a province or district is the most 
authoritative Hizballah member in that province or district." 
  According to the Diyarbakir State Security Court, the 
Hizballah organization acquires the funds it needs as follows: 
"The organization receives a share from the donations that are 
made to the mosques and the Koranic courses. It also secures 
funds from the organization's publications, donations from the 
families of deceased people, charitable activities, fees paid 
for Koranic recitations and requiems for the deceased, and 
extortion from businessmen." 
  The Diyarbakir State Security Court has established that the 
Hizballah organization recruits its militants from among the 
young men who attend the Koranic courses and the 
profundamentalist individuals who live in the organization's 
boarding houses.

  [Text] The attacks on Kurdish businessmen began when they 
were targeted in a statement by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller at 
the Holiday Inn Hotel in Istanbul on 4 November 1993. 
  During her news conference at the Holiday Inn Hotel, Ciller 
said: "Turkey is facing an expanding terrorist movement that has 
assumed the nature of a militia movement. We know the names of 
the businessmen and artists from whom PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] derives money. We will call them to account." 
  Behcet Canturk, a Kurdish businessman from Lice, became the 
first victim following Ciller's statement targeting Kurdish 
businessmen. Two days after being abducted in Istanbul on 15 
January 1994, Canturk and his driver Recep Kuzucu were found 
dead in Sapanca district of Adapazari. 
  After Canturk's murder, Fevzi Aslan and his nephew Salih 
Aslan, both businessmen from Lice, were abducted while visiting 
a friend at the Tokgoz Otomotiv firm in Istanbul's Sehremini 
district by armed persons claiming to be policemen. Two days 
later, Fevzi and Salih Aslan were found dead in Sapanca. 
  In statements made after these incidents, police officials 
said that the same gun was used in the murders. 
  Following these counterguerrilla attacks in Istanbul, Mecit 
Baskin, who is from Yuksekova and who was the director of births 
registry in Ankara's Altindag district and a relative of Savas 
Buldan [another murdered Kurdish businessmen], was found 
murdered near the beltway two days after being abducted. After 
the murder of Baskin, Behcet Canturk's lawyer Yusuf Ziya Ekinci 
was abducted in Ankara. Two days later he was found dead near 
Ankara's beltway. 
  Also, Namik Erdogan, a Kurd from Hakkari who was deputy 
chief 
of the inspection department at the Health Ministry, was 
abducted and murdered last month. Erdogan's body was found by a 
fountain near Kiliclar on the Kirikkale-Ankara highway.

<F P=106> [Report by Necat Sunar] </F>
  [Text] Istanbul -- Professor Mahir Kaynak, a former 
National Intelligence Organization (MIT) official and a faculty 
member at Gazi University, said that the murders of Kurdish 
businessmen and intellectuals may be the work of those who 
provided the names of these persons to Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller and her circle. 
  Kaynak said: "The fact that the style of the murders is the 
same is an indication that they are being committed by the same 
cadres." 
  We sought the views of the former MIT official Mahir Kaynak 
after the murders of the Kurdish businessmen by the 
counter-guerrillas following Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's 
statement that "we know the names of the businessmen and artists 
from whom PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] derives money; we 
will call them to account." Kaynak asserted that these murders 
were committed by those who submitted the names to Tansu Ciller. 
Kaynak, who replied to our questions before the murder of Savas 
Buldan, a Kurdish businessmen from Yuksekova, said that the 
murders might continue. 
  Stressing that in the aftermath of the latest economic and 
political developments the state has fallen into disintegration, 
Kaynak noted that this disarray further deepened with the crisis 
surrounding Gures [chief of General Staff], and asserted that 
there is a two-headed administration in Turkey. 
  Kaynak said: "At present the state has disintegrated 
considerably. Because of the economic and political 
disintegration, the current government cadres have lost their 
power. The incident surrounding Gures shows that there are two 
powers. That is, it is becoming clear that not a single power 
controls the developments in Turkey. As is evident from the 
Dogan Gures crisis, one power is supporting Dogan Gures. There 
is also another power which wants to push him out of the way. 
Therefore, political power in Turkey is not concentrated in one 
hand." 
  Arguing that the murder of Kurdish businessmen, 
intellectuals, and bureaucrats results from this two-headed 
administration within the state, Kaynak said: "The cadre that 
does not favor a political solution to the Kurdish problem is 
planning to commit such murders." 
  Indicating that the identical style of the murders is proof 
enough of their being committed by the same cadres, Kaynak said: 
"And, the purpose in murdering the businessmen with some 
intervals is not to create excessive uneasiness in the public. 
Once a murder is committed there is a waiting period to let it 
be forgotten. Then a second murder is committed. In this way 
the public does not pay much attention."

  [Excerpts] Remzi Kartal, deputy leader of DEP [Democracy 
Party], and Murat Bozlak, leader of HADEP [People's Democracy 
Party], held the government responsible for the killing of 
Muhsin Melik, a leading member of HADEP, and his driver Mehmet 
Ayyildiz, and asked for the dismissal of the governor and police 
chief of Urfa to enable a serious investigation. [passage 
omitted] 
  Kartal said that Melik refused to enter the police car that 
had come to the scene of the incident to take him to hospital, 
saying: "You shot me, I will not get in your car." 
<H5>  Order To Pull the Trigger Comes From Ciller and Karayalcin </H5>
  Kartal said that "no matter who pulls the trigger, the order 
to pull the trigger comes from Ciller and [Deputy Prime 
Minister] Karayalcin," and added: "With their policies Ciller 
and Karayalcin turned the country into a bloodbath. They will 
exhaust themselves and the country with these policies. They 
should either find the murderers or resign." 
  Indicating that all the government officials, above all the 
governor of the state of emergency region, are involved in these 
incidents, Kartal asked for the dismissal of the governor and 
police chief of Urfa. 
<H5>  Bozluk: The Shots Were Fired at Peace </H5>
  In a news conference at party headquarters, HADEP leader 
Murat Bozluk described Muhsin Melik "as a person who devoted his 
life to the people and who was a symbol of goodness and beauty." 
He added: "The shots fired at Muhsin have in fact been fired at 
peace and democracy." 
  Indicating that the murder was committed by the enemies of 
democracy who found themselves helpless in the face of the 
honorable struggle waged by Melik, Bozluk pointed out that 
before he died in the presence of the policemen, Melik said to 
those who gathered around him: "Those who shot me were 
policemen who have been tailing me for the last two days." 
  Bozlak said: "The murderers' faces and the model and plate 
number of the car used in the incident are all known. Most 
importantly, our colleague's words exist. The governor and 
police chief of Urfa should be dismissed and a serious inquiry 
opened."

  [Text] Cologne -- ERNK's [National Liberation Front of 
Kurdistan] European Mission issued a statement in which it 
indicated that despite the PKK's [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
capabilities it has so far not resorted to assassinations but 
from now on it will not be a mere spectator to developments, and 
said: "The businessmen, parliamentarians, policemen, officers, 
mayors, circles helping the state and their kin will definitely 
be targets from now on." 
  ERNK's European Mission issued a statement in connection 
with 
the murders of Kurdish businessmen Savas Buldan and his friends, 
and Muhsin Melik, a leading HADEP [People's Democracy Party] 
official. 
  Indicating that the state is murdering the Kurdish patriots 
because it is helpless in the face of the Kurdish national 
liberation struggle, the statement said: "Following Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller's statement that `I have a list of those 
helping the PKK,' the counter-guerrilla group, which runs the 
state, stepped up its sinister operations, which can be 
described as the massacre of civilians. As indicated by the 
incident involving Serif Avsar in the past, the president 
[Suleyman Demirel] is directly involved in these murders." 
  Stressing that the press is making enormous efforts to 
distort the causes of these murders, the statement said: "For 
the sake of the credits they obtain [from the state], the 
Turkish press and television, primarily HURRIYET and MILLIYET, 
have assumed the ignoble duty of covering up the murders of 
civilians by knowingly lying." 
  Indicating that in the murder of Muhsin Melik and Savas 
Buldan and of others before them, one should discern the policy 
of genocide being pursued by the Turkish Government against the 
Kurdish nation, the statement said: "After this developments, 
the Kurdish people and its vanguards have acquired the right to 
retaliate in kind." 
  Indicating that despite its capabilities the PKK has not 
resorted to assassinations so far, the statement said: "Despite 
its capabilities, the PKK has tried to act with sensitivity and 
responsibility on this issue. However, at this stage it can no 
longer remain a mere spectator to this state terrorism against 
our people. Therefore, it is resolved to demand an accounting 
for the murdered Kurdish patriots. Similarly, our people should 
use their right of self-defense. If the state is massacring us 
in Kurdistan, then we must retaliate in kind in the cities. 
Businessmen, parliamentarians and their kin, policemen and 
officers and their kin, circles helping the state and their kin 
will henceforth definitely become targets. Similarly, mayors 
and their kin, and those who are hostile to the national 
liberation struggle will also become targets."

outlawed organization fighting against the regime in Iran were 
captured in Ankara, it was reported on Saturday [11 June].

  [Text] Istanbul (AA) -- Selim Atalay reports -- The U.S. 
secretary of state and the Russian foreign minister held a joint 
news conference here today confirming that Russia will sign the 
Partnership for Peace [PFP] document. 
  Andrey Kozyrev announced that he will go to Brussels to sign 
the document. He did not indicate the date on which the 
document will be signed, but said "in the near future." 
  Asked what exactly is needed for Russia to sign the PFP, 
Kozyrev did not reply for a while, showing his displeasure at 
the question, but then said: "That is the last question to be 
asked in connection with the PFP." 
  Kozyrev pointed out that there will be differences in the 
implementation of the PFP in line with the characteristics of 
each country. Russia's situation will be approached within this 
framework, he said. 
  The Russian foreign minister also spoke of "a comprehensive 
organization excluding the mutual right to veto." 
  Kozyrev pointed out that he met with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher for two and one-half hours and then met again 
at dinner yesterday, adding: "Very fruitful talks were held at 
dinner. We made progress because Tansu Ciller was with us." 
  Secretary of State Christopher stressed that the United 
States is pleased that Russia is going to sign the PFP, and said 
that even if they have differences of opinion, there exists a 
basis for reaching a solution. 
  Replying to a question on the conflict between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan, Christopher recalled that he met with Azerbaijani 
President Aliyev. The secretary of state pointed out that the 
solution should be found within the framework of the CSCE, and 
opportunities must be created for the continuation of the 
cease-fire. He added that Kozyrev agreed with him regarding 
this issue. 
  Meanwhile, Christopher and Kozyrev announced that they 
agreed 
to propose that the United Nations impose sanctions on North 
Korea. Christopher stated that they will submit a draft 
resolution to the United Nations "in the coming days" to impose 
sanctions on that country and to convene an international 
conference on the issue of North Korea's nuclear power. He 
explained that U.S. President Clinton and Russian President 
Yeltsin discussed the North Korea issue on the telephone. 
  Kozyrev pointed out that the issue of sanctions and the 
issue 
of an international conference are directed at "a single aim," 
adding: "We cannot tolerate a violation of the nuclear 
nonproliferation agreement."

  [Excerpt] The North Atlantic Cooperation Council meeting 
began in Istanbul today. Attending today's meeting are a total 
of 41 countries, including 16 NATO member countries, 22 
countries which signed the Partnership for Peace program, and 
Slovenia, Finland, and Sweden as observers. The meeting started 
with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin's speech. 
  Cetin declared that the meeting in Istanbul, which links 
Asia 
to Europe, is fulfilling the function of a bridge between 
different communities and former adversaries. In short, this is 
where East meets West and north meets south, Cetin stated. He 
remarked that recent changes have eliminated the rigid unions of 
the past and countries which attained their independence have 
now occupied the places they deserve in the international arena. 
  Cetin continued: We are well aware, however, that this 
transition period has not always been civilized and peaceful. 
Old dangers such as excessive nationalism, racism, and 
xenophobia have resurfaced in certain places. We observed the 
total eradication of logic and humanitarian feelings of 
compassion. Certain communities appear to prefer a struggle to 
the death instead of rapprochement and a quest for 
reconciliation. They seem to have abandoned all the values of 
the civilized world. 
  Cetin announced that Russia's participation in the program 
is 
important and said that he expects this to happen. 
  Also addressing the meeting, NATO Deputy Secretary General 
Sergio Balanzino noted that cooperation is the most viable way 
to achieve security and stability in Europe. Otherwise, 
Balanzino remarked, we will be faced with instability and 
division, stressing that the efforts of the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council on this matter are very important. 
  After the speeches, the meeting continued in camera.

  [Excerpt] The session of the NATO Cooperation Council 
attended by 16 NATO foreign ministers and their partners from 
the Central and East European countries opened in Istanbul 
today. The Czech Republic is represented by Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec. Our special correspondent Klara Stejskalova 
reports from the venue. 
  [Stejskalova] Partnership for Peace is an important 
practical 
step toward full incorporation of the Czech Republic into the 
North Atlantic alliance, Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said 
at the beginning of his speech. 
  We regard the political program of Partnership for Peace as 
being of equal importance to the military program. We cannot 
imagine, however, the principles of partnership being challenged 
by one country gaining a special status. 
  Our interest in NATO is linked with (enhancement of) 
European 
security. But enlargement will be meaningful only if the 
alliance adapts itself to new conditions. Any Russian demands 
to subject NATO to the CSCE are unacceptable to our side. 
  At the conclusion of his speech Minister Zieleniec recalled 
President Havel's participation in the commemoration of the 
Allied landing in Normandy. His participation was a symbol of 
the continuity of our co-responsibility for the fate of Europe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by Rahmi Aygun </F>
in the studio in Istanbul -- live] 
  [Text] [Aygun] The North Atlantic Cooperation Council 
[NACC] meeting has been held in Istanbul. The joint statement 
which was supposed to be issued at 1800 [1500 GMT] has not been 
issued yet, because of arguments among the member countries 
concerning the agreement on the reduction of the conventional 
forces in Europe [CFE] and on the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. 
The news conference to be held by NATO's acting secretary 
general at 1800 has been postponed for the same reason. In 
fact, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin was to have held a news 
conference at 1915. His news conference has been postponed for 
the same reason. However, the foreign minister is now here with 
us. Mr. Minister, welcome. What is the reason for the delay? 
  [Cetin] Of course the delay should be received with 
understanding. Some 38 countries have come together. 
Furthermore, countries that used to be enemies in the past. 
The NATO and former Warsaw Pact countries used to be enemies 
for a long time. Now, a new organization and a new working 
system is being set up envisaging their cooperation. 
Consequently, you need the 38 countries to agree on the joint 
statement. There were long arguments about two issues, like you 
said. One of them concerns the CFE; Russia wanted to include in 
the statement that this issue will be discussed by the countries 
involved. Long arguments and negotiations were held. In the 
end, an agreement was reached not to include that in the 
statement. 
  The second issue is also understandable. Azerbaijan and 
Armenia, which are members of the NACC, are in conflict with 
each other, in fact Armenia has occupied Azeri land. These two 
countries are expected to reach an agreement. Naturally, it 
took some time for them to agree. In the end, an agreement was 
reached, and the problem of the statement was resolved. Of 
course, the negotiations are still going on. The ministers are 
continuing to express their views on general issues. I will go 
back to the meeting soon. 
  [Aygun] There are certain misunderstandings between NATO and 
Russia concerning the signing of the Partnership for Peace [PFP] 
agreement. How do you view the relations between Russia and 
NATO? It seems that the process of signing the PFP will take 
some time. 
  [Cetin] Everything is being done to ensure that it will not 
take long. Russia wants to establish with NATO different kinds 
of relations than the relations of the Central and East European 
countries. It wants to change the PFP agreement into special 
relations. The Russian defense minister made certain proposals 
in connection with this matter a while ago. The answer of the 
NATO ministerial council, of the 16 member countries, was clear: 
Special relations will not be established with any country. 
Only the PFP framework agreement can be signed. 
  However, given Russia's position and the contributions it 
can 
make to Europe, and to peace and stability, certain special 
cooperation fields can be developed with it after it signs the 
PFP agreement. Mostly, in line with the contributions Russia 
will make in the implementation of the agreement, more 
cooperation possibilities can be developed. Another framework 
agreement will not be signed. 
  A second demand by Russia that was not accepted -- the 
Russians had several requests which were mostly accepted -- was 
to turn the NACC into an independent organization from NATO, in 
fact, into a superior organization to NATO. This will not be 
accepted. NATO has to continue with its former power and former 
identity. The ministers agreed on that absolutely. In other 
words, NATO cannot be turned into an organization where certain 
countries and Russia will have the right to veto. NATO cannot 
be turned into a secondary organization in Europe. NATO is 
determined to maintain its former identity. Within this 
framework, all the countries want Russia to sign the PFP 
framework agreement as soon as possible. As I said, Russia can 
be expected to make higher contributions to peace and stability. 
New cooperation possibilities can be developed in line with its 
contributions. A proposal was made to sign an additional 
protocol together with the PFP agreement. This was rejected as 
well. 
  [Aygun] You are saying that NATO is not making any 
concessions. 
  [Cetin] Yes, NATO is remaining loyal to its principles. It 
does not want to differentiate first class countries and second 
countries among the countries with which it is establishing 
relations under the PFP agreement. They must all sign the same 
framework agreement. 
  [Aygun] Thank you, Mr. Minister.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION </F>
political staff] 
  [Text] Labour swept into the Tory heartlands with dramatic 
victories right across the country in the European election 
results declared overnight. 
  But the Tory vote -- pitiful though it was -- held up just 
sufficiently to earn John Major a reprieve from a leadership 
challenge in the autumn -- or at least he hopes so. 
  Even so voters deserted the Tory cause in droves, and 
citadel 
after citadel fell to Labour in what was the worst Conservative 
performance in a nation-wide poll this century. 
  The Liberal Democrats won a breakthrough by securing their 
first two Euro-seats ever, but their overall performance 
nation-wide was unimpressive compared with the triumphant march 
of Labour. 
  Now John Major, who edges back from the brink of possible 
personal disaster, will face massive demands for a wholesale 
Cabinet reshuffle in which John Patten, the Eduction Secretary, 
would almost certainly be one of the casualties. 
  Conservative Party managers gained little comfort today from 
their claim throughout that they had won the argument during the 
campaign. 
  The stark fact is that the Tories have lost 13 seats so far 
in the 73 results declared overnight, one of the casualties 
being Sir Christopher Prout, the party's leader in the European 
Parliament. 
  And Tory MP Hugh Dykes, chairman of the European Movement, 
pronounced the result a "monumental disaster," accusing 
Conservative Central Office of letting Tory candidates down and 
blaming them fair and square for the "debacle." 
  Meanwhile, a jubilant Margaret Beckett, the Opposition 
leader, said the Tories had been overtaken by a "political 
earthquake" which would have put Labour into power in the House 
of Commons with a massive three-figure overall majority. 
  However, it seems as if John Major lives to fight another 
day, even though maverick Tory Tony Marlow renewed his demand 
that he should quit office and make way for a stronger leader.

  [Excerpts] Wuensdorf (DDP/ADN) -- The supreme command of 
the Western Group of Russian Troops (WGT) in Wuensdorf, 
Brandenburg, officially bade farewell to Germany with a troop 
parade today. After the parade, which included military 
hardware and around 1,000 soldiers, WGT Commander in Chief 
Colonel General Matvey Burlakov and Prime Minister of 
Brandenburg Manfred Stolpe spoke in favor of completing the 
final phase of troop withdrawal in a dignified way and of 
cultivating friendly contacts in future. 
  Stolpe assured the returnees further support in providing 
housing in Russia and training for civilian jobs. He pointed 
out that the Western Group had so far carried out the return of 
troops successfully and without major incidents. [passage 
omitted] 
  The official date for the final withdrawal of the Russian 
troops from Germany is 31 August.

<F P=106> [RITZAUS BUREAU report: "Domestic Politics Stole the Top </F>
Billing From EU"] 
  [Text] Herning -- European Union [EU] Election 1994. The 
Western European Union (WEU), the effort against unemployment, 
and developments in East Europe were highest on the agenda when 
a very vocally engaged crowd of around 1,000 middle Jutlanders 
formed a living backdrop in Herning Convention Center on Monday 
[30 May] for the first direct meeting between Liberal Party 
Chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Prime Minister Poul Nyrup 
Rasmussen (Social Democrat), and the voters. 
  Gradually as the debate got under way the European issue 
glided into the background, however. Comments about the election 
for the European Parliament were few and far between, while the 
lead-up to the Folketing election, the recovery, and 
significance of the government's economic policy took by far the 
most speaking time. 
  Rasmussen asserted again and again "that it's really going 
well in Denmark." New jobs are being created, and businesses are 
investing at a furious pace. 
  The optimistic tones provoked challenger Ellemann-Jensen to 
warn against a next government -- after the parliamentary 
election -- that would be bring about rising taxes to pay for 
the paid leave scheme and loose fiscal policy. 
  When the Liberal Party chairman's favorite topic came up -- 
the issue of Danish membership in the WEU and Denmark's 
security-policy placement in Europe -- it was given the same 
importance in the debate as domestic issues. 
  The two leaders' widely differing views regarding in which 
"tier" Denmark belongs was a sure winner among the audience in 
Herning. While the prime minister found the hostile tone strange 
and underlined that Denmark is always present where the vital 
decisions are made, namely in the EU and in NATO, 
Ellemann-Jensen -- amid boos from SDP [Social Democratic Party] 
supporters -- painted a less positive picture of Denmark's 
international position. 
  "Denmark ranks at the bottom of the fourth tier and has just 
about isolated itself in Europe," he said.

to continue talks on the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. 
REUTER added that President Kliridhis outlines this position in

Minister John Major. 
  According to the letters, copies of which REUTER claims to

who would be free from the committments Mr. Kliridhis has 
undertaken, would have to decide on the CBM's issue. 
  Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis announced today 
that 
President Kliridhis sent letters to President Clinton and Prime 
Minister John Major. Mr. Kasoulidhis said that the letters aim 
at promoting our side's positions and pointed out that the 
United States and Britain are the two powers who recently moved 
in the direction of continuing the CBM's process. 
  In a statement to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] 
tonight, the government spokesman reiterated his statement from 
yesterday saying he does not know of President Kliridhis' 
intention to resign and added that he is not aware of the 
content of the letters.

measures should not be viewed as dead. [passage omitted]

He was received at Esenboga Airport by Interior Minister Nahit 
Mentese. In a statement at the airport, Mentese said that 
Turkey and Iran, which are linked by common values, unity of 
faith, and deep cultural ties, are two friendly, neighboring 
countries with special relations. Mentese stressed that the 
Turkish-Iranian border has been a line of peace for many 
centuries. 
  [Begin Mentese recording] As two neighboring countries, 
Turkey and Iran have common fields of information on which they 
must exchange views, especially in the security area. It is 
also a known fact that certain developments which take place in 
one country affects the other as well. [end recording] 
  In his statement, the Iranian interior minister declared 
that 
the security issue as well as military, political, and 
interparliamentary matters will be discussed during the talks in 
Turkey. Besharati noted: It is my impression that this is the 
first time that the friendly relations between Iran and Turkey 
have reached such a high level. 
  The two ministers then left Esenboga for Izmir, where 
Besharati will be received by President Suleyman Demirel before 
returning to Ankara.

  [Text] Nicosia, June 12 (AFP) -- Sixteen Iranian 
asylum-seekers facing expulsion from Turkey are not members of 
the armed opposition People's Mujahedin, the group said Sunday 
[12 June]. 
  "The persons in question are not in any way related to the 
Mujahedeen and its activities," it said in a statement sent to 
AFP in Nicosia. 
  "The Government of Turkey is responsible for the protection 
and safety of all Iranian asylum-seekers," the group said, a day 
after the Turkish news agency ANATOLIA said they were being 
expelled to Iraq. 
  "If for whatever reason it does not wish to accept them, it 
must relocate them in European countries with the help of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees," said the 
Mujahedeen. 
  It said the group had helped the 16 Iranians seek refuge in 
Turkey for humanitarian reasons only. They had been living in 
Ramadi, west of Baghdad, and some had been POWs during the 
1980-1988 war between Iran and Iraq. 
  But ANATOLIA said the 16 had confessed to having entered 
Turkey with false passports and received military training at a 
Mujahedin camp in Iraq. 
  The Turkish Interior Ministry rejected their request for 
political asylum and drove them to Silopi on the Iraqi border, 
it reported, quoting a senior police official as saying the 
expulsion was a goodwill gesture to Iran.

  [Text] "We have obtained this result because the Italians 
want change and we can provide it," Berlusconi said in a 
telephone interview from his house in Arcore. He was not 
surprised by Forza Italia's result ("our polls had forecast 
it"), but he thought "the Center would lose more." 
  "In any case, the results show that there is a gap between 
the voters of the Center and its leaders, who are too close to 
the Left," he added. 
  On the League's losses, Berlusconi was very severe: "They 
should examine their conscience. People like those who respect 
pacts."

<F P=106> [Report by Mino Fuccillo: "Italians, Vote for Me"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Rome -- Sunday [12 June] will see the first 
referendum on the government, called by [Prime Minister] Silvio 
Berlusconi. This is how he put it: "I expect many votes for 
myself, for my party, and for the majority. The vote is for 
Europe, but in the elections the Italian people will be telling 
me: We like your government; carry on; we are with you. Or 
not, in which case they will vote against the government." As 
his mouth voiced this wager, the prime minister's eyes showed 
that he was wagering on a virtual certainty, as he clung to 
Forza Italia's good-luck charm -- the latest, inevitable, 
promising opinion poll. 
  So next weekend will be the time for a referendum or, 
rather, 
a plebiscite, which is for what the prime minister is calling. 
With regard to the recent past, he judged it unnecessarily full 
of "bugbears" and "windmills." This is the substance of the 
anxieties about the neofascist ministers, the suspicions and 
hostility expressed abroad; so said Silvio Berlusconi, who 
offered his personal loyalty to democratic principles as an 
"absolute guarantee." As he repeated for the umpteenth time 
that there is no Fascism and no problem, his smile grew 
strained: These things irritate him, to the extent that he let 
slip a half-insult to [French President] Mitterrand: "There are 
abroad some old politicians who have been in power too long and 
who are seeking electioneering arguments...." 
  At last a ready-made referendum, albeit an informal one: on 
whether or not the Italians like a prime minister who is also 
owner of Fininvest and many other things besides. Berlusconi 
announced its result: "I have consulted the people. The 
situation is already clear now; the guarantees are there; what 
more do people want?" But perhaps Berlusconi will do something 
more; perhaps he will sell: "I have thought about relinquishing 
my companies to my five children." He let it be known that he 
has not yet decided whether to go so far, but certainly any 
future sale will not take place outside his family. It is 
unnecessary, he repeated, but this, he made it understand, is 
the last sacrifice that he is prepared to make: "My company no 
longer belongs to me; I own shares and I do not rule out selling 
them in the future." So tomorrow Fininvest could be owned not 
by one Berlusconi but by five Berlusconis. [passage omitted] 
  Prime Minister, there are some anxieties.... "They have no 
reason to exist. There is a complete democracy in Italy. And 
if there are any dangers, they do not stem from the Right and 
the center-Right. There is nothing to worry about; the fact is 
that abroad, in France, in Greece, people are tilting at 
windmills." Prime Minister, there are the fascists.... "I 
testify to the complete adherence to democracy of the people in 
my government. The Israeli under secretary merely expressed a 
personal opinion. Clinton has understood that there was no 
democratic alternative to this majority in Italy. People are 
brandishing bugbears. But I have worked as a publisher, out in 
the open. There are not many people of whom it can be said, as 
it can of me, that they have made a profession of democracy. 
And this is the absolute guarantee." 
  Prime Minister, the European elections.... "I am standing as 
a candidate, even though I cannot be a member of the European 
Parliament. It was important, essential, for me to lead the 
movement. These elections will serve the government and have a 
domestic significance. They must grant the government greater 
authority than it has now." Prime Minister, are you referring 
to the League? The prime minister elegantly evaded the question 
and preferred to stress "Italy's need for a government that will 
not change after a short space of time. A tragic legacy cannot 
be changed in 100 days. Furthermore, please be patient; we are 
not yet acquainted with the state machinery." There must be no 
public disputes between the allies, and the government must be a 
"long" one. Bossi and voters, please take note. 
  Prime Minister, your companies.... "I am light years away 
from them. I have asked the people. Should I sell? And if so, 
to whom? This somebody does not exist. The real guarantee is my 
conscience. I am a man of government." The last question 
concerned the celebrations and the emphasis that the Right 
placed on the anniversary of 24 May 1918, but Berlusconi 
misunderstood, thinking that it was a return to the dispute 
about Fascism, and replied by asserting his loyalty to the 
principles of the Republic and his aversion to dictatorship: 
"Let us concentrate on the future, on the real problems, not on 
dangers that do not exist." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Labor Minister Clemente Mastella by Roberto </F>
Petrini; place and date not given: "Mastella Will Follow a Soft 
Line: `No Decrees on Employment' -- first two paragraphs are LA 
REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- The employment package is in the hands of 
[Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi, who will be meeting the 
trade unions next week. In the meantime, Labor Minister 
Clemente Mastella is sending out peace signals, and has 
announced the government's preparedness to adopt the provisions 
on employment through a draft bill, thus renouncing the 
controversial decree option. "I told the prime minister that we 
had to speak with the unions: Negotiations must work," the 
minister explained. 
  In the meantime, reactions from the trade unions are 
cautiously positive. According to Bruno Trentin, CGIL [Italian 
General Confederation of Labor] leader, "it is essential" that 
the fiscal "bonus" for employers taking on new staff be limited 
to indefinite duration contracts, since otherwise "many forms of 
precarious employment would benefit from tax deductions." For 
his part, CGIL "number two" Sergio Cofferanti expressed the 
suspicion that the provision's postponement was a way of 
avoiding the issue until after the elections. On the other 
hand, Sergio D'Antoni, CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade 
Unions] secretary, believed that Berlusconi had "acted wisely." 
  [Petrini] Minister Mastella, despite the mediation attempts, 
your proposed legislation is at a standstill. Why is this so? 
  [Mastella] If we want to safeguard the employment situation, 
we must bear in mind three factors: We must place our stakes on 
recovery, guarantee social peace, and implement flexible 
instruments. Therefore no sudden breaks. 
  [Petrini] Therefore the way forward is through negotiations? 
  [Mastella] Certainly. 
  [Petrini] Was everyone agreed on this line at last 
Wednesday's [8 June] Council of Ministers meeting? Were there 
no "hawks"? 
  [Mastella] I attended the Council of Ministers meeting after 
meeting with the trade unions, and I explained that we could not 
move toward a head-on confrontation if we wanted to preserve 
social peace. They listened to me. 
  [Petrini] How did things go with Berlusconi? 
  [Mastella] I explained to Berlusconi that the trade unions 
were also requesting to speak with him in order to get a full 
picture of the situation, and that we should not be perceived to 
be mistreating them. 
  [Petrini] However, now everything has been postponed until 
next week, when the prime minister will meet the unions. As far 
as the proposed legislation is concerned, has a rapprochement 
taken place? 
  [Mastella] For my part, I have not taken up any rigid 
positions. 
  [Petrini] How do you mean, minister? The trade unions do not 
want this area to be tackled by means of decree laws. Do you 
agree? 
  [Mastella] If we draw up a draft bill instead, it will not 
be 
the end of the world. 
  [Petrini] Another hurdle is constituted by entry wage 
levels. 
The unions will not listen to any talk about reducing wages by 
law, but seem to be better disposed to a solution based on free 
bargaining between the two sides. What is your position? 
  [Mastella] I am also prepared to discuss this point. Among 
other things, we must determine whether the question is to be 
solved at national or, alternatively, at company level. In any 
case, we must realize that something must be done. 
  [Petrini] Furthermore, there is the issue of the overlapping 
incentives for new employment, including limited time contracts, 
entry wage levels, part-time arrangements, and so on. The unions 
seem to have adopted a fairly rigid stance in this respect. 
What is your opinion? 
  [Mastella] In this respect, we view things differently from 
the unions. In my opinion, the measures are complementary, 
rather than alternative. My philosophy is not a Dash-type 
philosophy, according to which "two temporary jobs are better 
than a single permanent job." However, it is undeniable that a 
temporary job is better than nothing at all. Let me remind you 
that families take this view too. 
  [Petrini] Yet, a temporary job does not seem to be anyone's 
maximum aspiration.... 
  [Mastella] We must bear in mind that these measures are to 
be 
taken at a specific stage in the development of the economy. We 
are not aiming to keep them in force for ever. Two or three 
years from now, we can review the situation.

  [Text] Luxembourg, June 13 (AFP) -- The European Union 
[EU] has reached "essential political agreement" to sign a 
partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia, diplomats 
said during a meeting of EU foreign ministers here Monday [13 
June]. 
  The agreement is scheduled to be signed by EU leaders with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin during a European summit on the 
Greek island of Corfu on Friday and Saturday next week if two 
last-minute hitches are overcome. 
  "This means that President Yeltsin should be ready to come 
to 
Corfu next week to sign," the chairman of the European Union's 
Council of Ministers, Theodoros Pangalos, said. 
  Officials here said that the ministers had reached an 
"essential political agreement" to wrap up the accord, but that 
two hitches remained. 
  The Netherlands said it was still waiting for confirmation 
in 
writing of a Russian assurance that two Dutch banks already 
licensed to operate in Russia would be freely allowed to gather 
Russian clients. 
  And the diplomats said there might not be time to translate 
the agreement into the European Union's nine official languages 
and Russian by the time of the summit. 
  In that case, a French official said, President Yeltsin 
would 
probably be invited to the Corfu summit to endorse a declaration 
saying that the agreement was settled and would be signed later 
when the translations were complete. 
  The sole outstanding problem of substance concerned the 
European Union's insistence that five EU banks be exempted from 
a Russian law restricting their right to attract Russian clients 
in Russia. 
  Two of the banks are Dutch. A Dutch diplomat said the 
Netherlands was not satisfied with a Russian assurance at the 
weekend that the exemptions would be granted. "We want it in 
black and white," he said. 
  The partnership agreement, under negotiation for two years, 
is a key part of Western attempts to bolster the Russian 
economy. It offers Russia greater access to the EU market and 
more political dialogue. 
  It also holds out the prospect of a Russia-European Union 
free trade zone after 1997 if Moscow has made enough progress 
towards a market economy by then. 
  Meanwhile, the European Union confirmed that it would sign a 
similar partnership and cooperation agreement with Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk on Tuesday. 
  Two accords will be signed -- an overall agreement which 
faces a lengthy ratification process in Russia, all EU countries 
and the European Parliament, and an interim economic pact which 
will come into effect immediately. 
  In separate but related negotiations, the European Union is 
also trying to persuade Ukraine to close down the dangerous 
Chernobyl nuclear power station, the site of the world's worst 
civilian nuclear accident in 1986. 
  The European Union has pledged to help mobilise Western 
countries to pay the costs of closing down the plant, and partly 
finance two new nuclear power stations to replace the Chernobyl 
output. 
  But the two sides have not yet reached agreement on the cost 
of the Chernobyl closed-down, or the share of the bill to be met 
by the West.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French 
President Francois Mitterrand have lent emphasis to their 
initiative for a speedy closure of the Ukrainian nuclear power 
station Chernobyl. In a letter to the heads of state and 
government of the European Union (EU) and the G-7 countries, as 
well as to European Commission President Jacques Delors, the two 
leaders said that another accident in Chernobyl would have 
far-reaching consequences for the population, the whole human 
race, and the international energy situation. The initiative 
was announced by Kohl and Mitterrand at the French-German summit 
in Mulhouse [at the end of May]. 
  According to government spokesman Dieter Vogel, Kohl and 
Mitterrand expressed their conviction that the topic will be a 
"central issue" of the talks at the EU summit in Corfu at the 
end of June and at the G-7 summit in Naples in mid-July. A plan 
of action for the closure of Chernobyl is to be decided on in 
Naples.

<F P=106> [Interview with EU Commission President Jacques Delors by </F>
Guenter Schmidt in Brussels on 12 June -- recorded; Delors 
statements in French with superimposed German translation] 
  [Text] [Schmidt] Mr. President, a great majority of 
Austrians has voted in favor of the EU [European Union] entry. 
What does this overwhelming Austrian support mean for Europe? 
  [Delors] Well, first of all I would like to welcome our 
Austrian friends, regardless of how they voted in the 
referendum. I would like to say that this overwhelming support 
for Europe is most encouraging for our project. Austria is a 
people of free citizens who have witnessed how Europe has been 
built, with all the advantages and disadvantages, all nice and 
not so nice sides. These people have finally decided to join 
us. This has an impact that goes even beyond the decision of 
the Austrian people in favor of Europe. 
  [Schmidt] Some have said that enlargement would obstruct or 
slow down the further deepening of European integration. Do you 
share this view? 
  [Delors] The thing is that we do not have a choice. You 
will certainly remember that those who started this European 
adventure were pursuing two main objectives. First of all, 
there should never again be war between us. Second, they wanted 
to strengthen the peace values, the values of mutual 
understanding between the people through cooperation. Unity 
makes you strong. So how could we limit ourselves to 12 
European states, how could we be against other countries joining 
us, especially a country like Austria, considering that Vienna 
has always been one of the major cultural capitals of Europe, a 
city that was host to great historic events so important for our 
continent. The message to our generation now is: You must 
extend the values of peace and mutual understanding. And 
Austria can contribute to this process. Located in the center 
of Europe, it is the ideal link between West and East. For all 
those reasons there was no other choice. We had to discuss 
Austria's membership application. We will have to see how we 
can reconcile enlargement with a capacity of deepening that 
reflects our ideas and desires. 
  [Schmidt] You have said that Austria was in the center of 
Europe and that it is a bridge between East and West. You also 
mentioned that the future of the European Union would also mean 
securing peace in East Europe. In this connection, do you 
perceive any special role Austria might play as a bridge, as a 
mediator? 
  [Delors] As a result of the friendly relations that I have 
with the Austrian chancellor and the numerous talks I conducted 
with the foreign minister, I have realized how sensitive and 
receptive your country is to everything that is going on in 
Europe, and how much it knows about the things that might 
threaten the stability of our continent today and tomorrow: the 
rejection of the other -- which is the case in the tragedy in 
Yugoslavia, ethnic groups that regard themselves as nations, the 
religious wars, racism, populism. Austria is really in a good 
situation to know all those things. I do not have to recall how 
much Chancellor Kreisky fought for major issues that went beyond 
Austria. Austria is a great nation, it will make its 
contribution to Europe, and, nevertheless, remain Austria with 
its unmistakable personality. 
  [Schmidt] Mr. President, looking into the future, one can 
see one major economic and social problem -- unemployment. You 
have suggested an initiative for more growth and the struggle 
against unemployment. It looks now as if this initiative would 
be further delayed before concrete steps are taken. What can be 
done, what ought to be done to implement this program more 
rapidly? 
  [Delors] Since the summit of heads of state and government 
adopted my proposals contained in the white book, we have done a 
lot of work. The next European Council will be held in two 
weeks time in Corfu under Greek chairmanship. There we will 
have to take further steps. What can prevent us from taking 
those steps? Well, shortsightedness might be an obstacle, the 
fact that actions are taken shortsightedly, that people might 
say: Well, now that we have the first signs of economic growth 
again we might as well let things stand where they are. But 
this is wrong. All countries of Europe now have to come to 
terms with three major changes: A change of the international 
economy with the emergence of new competitors -- the East Asian 
countries and, in the future, also China; then a technological 
change that we have to get under control -- from economic but 
also social aspects; the new technologies -- these are ethical 
problems but also problems of organization for society; and a 
change in the values of our society. 
  The advantage of the white paper is that it opened the 
windows to the medium-term sphere, that it initiated a debate. 
If one follows the guidelines of the white paper then one can 
hope that unemployment will decrease by half at the end of the 
century. I deliberately said at the end of the century. This 
means that these efforts will take another five or six years. 
Still, the possibilities are there, and the Commission must now 
try to convince the governments and public opinions of the need 
to tackle the changes. Otherwise, Europe would be overtaken by 
history, and, for the first time in Europe, be marginalized -- 
and all this after we have contributed so much to history. For 
us this is a question of survival. 
  [Schmidt] Mr. President, 10 years ago you brought a new 
vision to Europe, the vision of the single market. This vision 
of a Europe without borders has become reality. What is your 
new vision today for the future of this continent and the EU, in 
particular? 
  [Delors] As I said before, I think that we have to make sure 
that in this European continent, which will soon have a 
population of 500 million, the values of peace and mutual 
understanding will prevail, that our methods remain valid, and 
that we will continue to have cooperation, the exchange of 
people, of ideas, town partnerships, economic cooperation and, I 
hope, political cooperation in the near future. These are 
imperatives. If we fail to put them into practice, then the 
postcommunist era, the post-Cold War era will become an era 
characterized by conflicts that we are unable to settle. Then 
all the negative things will come to the surface -- racism, 
populism, the rejection of the other, inaccessibility, 
intolerance. We must together turn this Europe of 500 million 
citizens into an example for peace. At the same time, we also 
must not forget that some of us are seeking a political Europe. 
This means that we would like sovereign states to join forces 
and take actions in the world together, to protect our 
interests, and to serve our ideals. This will probably make it 
necessary to strengthen and change the institutions in 1996. 
You have just asked me how one could make enlargement and 
deepening compatible. The question will still have to be 
answered. Yet, it would be bad to say that we can only have one 
or the other, when we have to achieve both objectives. 
  Will there be one or two Europes in the future, a large 
Europe in the way I have just described, or maybe even a smaller 
group of countries that are moving toward political union? This 
is possible. Yet, I am against saying enlargement or deepening 
when we need both. After all, for me 1989 was the most important 
date I have experienced apart from the war. Communism collapsed 
and we must now be generous toward those who lived under the 
communist yoke before, and we must be ready to accept them into 
our community. 
  [Schmidt] Mr. President, thank you very much for the 
interview.

<F P=106> [Erich Hauser report: "Belgians Give Neofascists Cold </F>
Shoulder"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 9 June -- In the European Union (EU) 
neofascist members of the new Italian Government are openly 
slighted. Some EU politicians do not even want to shake hands 
with them. 
  The nomination of Belgian head of government Jan-Luc Dehaene 
as the successor of Brussels Commission President Jacques Delors 
is looking increasingly unlikely. Since Belgian ministers 
openly dissociate themselves from their Italian colleagues from 
the neofascist National Alliance in EU Council of Ministers' 
meetings, observers expect Italian Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi to reject the "favorite" of Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
and President Francois Mitterrand out of consideration for the 
Roman coalition. 
  Since Delors' successor has to be unanimously nominated in 
the circle of the 12 heads of government, all the more respect 
is paid to the attitude of the Belgian ministers. Citing the 
EU's democratic bases, representatives of Belgium (which, with 
Greece and Germany, is a member of the EU presidency troika) 
have already expressed their protest twice. At the meeting of 
the EU ministers responsible for telecommunications on 30 May, 
Belgian Elio di Rupo, son of Italian immigrants, made a 
statement and reportedly refused to shake hands with Giuseppe 
Tatarella, Rome's minister for post and telecommunications. It 
is his personal decision to refrain from any contact with his 
Italian colleagues, Di Rupo said. In response, Tatarella 
allegedly said that Benito Mussolini had abolished handshakes in 
Italy and replaced them with the "Caesarian greeting" (of the 
raised arm.) 
  During the second appearance of an Alliance minister -- at 
the EU environment minister's meeting in Luxembourg on Wednesday 
-- Belgian Minister Jacques Santkin, for his part, made a 
statement: "Precisely after the D-Day celebrations, it has to 
be clearly affirmed what the bases of democracy are." This 
time, Italian Alliance Minister Altero Matteoli answered that 
"the principles of freedom and democracy, which have been 
addressed, will never again be doubted." 
  Well-informed circles in Brussels proceed on the assumption 
that Belgium's protest attitude is determined by Dehaene's 
socialist coalition partner and not due to a secret agreement in 
the "troika" with Bonn and Athens. 
  In the Dutch Parliament, the parties said that an Alliance 
candidate nominated by Italy for the future EU Commission would 
be "boycotted." Before assuming office in January, the future 
EU Commission will have to face a "vote of agreement" of the new 
European Parliament. Even now, it is doubtful that a Commission 
member from the Alliance will obtain the agreement of the 
majority in Strasbourg.

<F P=106> [Report by Erich Hoorn: "Exports to West Europe Recovering </F>
Strongly This Year"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- From 1990-93, Austrian exports to West 
Europe (excluding Germany) declined by 12 percent to 158.5 
billion schillings. Only this year, a strong revival can be 
registered. The development in Germany, Austria's largest sales 
market, was completely different because of the boom in the wake 
of German unification. 
  In an interview with DIE PRESSE, Jan Stankovsky, foreign 
trade expert of the Economic Research Institute, says that the 
decline in exports to West Europe (without the FRG) was due to 
the recession on the Old Continent. In addition, in 1993 the 
devaluation that took place in many West European countries in 
autumn 1992 had a very negative effect. In particular, the 
deliveries to the devaluating countries Scandinavia, Great 
Britain, and Italy, registered a strong slump in 1993. On the 
other hand, the decline in exports to France, which hardly 
changed the exchange rate of the franc, was limited. 
<H5>  Good Economic Development </H5>
  Stankovsky thinks that the upswing in exports to West Europe 
this year is due to a general revival of the economic 
development. However, the disadvantages arising from the 
currencies continue to have an effect because, this time, 
inflation did not skyrocket so much in the devaluating countries 
as was the case when the currencies were devalued in the past. 
"This is a new challenge to the Austrian export industry," 
Stankovsky says. 
  Therefore, Austria must keep a close watch on its 
competitiveness. One must observe cost discipline. In 
addition, one must try to eliminate the existing discriminations 
on the West European markets by, for instance, joining the 
European Union. 
<H5>  Shifts to the East </H5>
  Cooperation with the young countries in East Europe also 
offers itself as an opportunity. Domestic companies could shift 
their wage-cost-intensive productions there and buy cheap 
subcontractor parts from there to be competitive in West Europe, 
Stankovsky says. 
  In view of the boom in the wake of German unification, 
Austrian exports to Germany also developed well in 1991 and 
1992. Only in 1993 did the economic situation in the FRG 
deteriorate all at once, which entailed a decline in Austrian 
exports. In 1993, Germany had a share of 39 percent of all 
Austrian exports. West Europe's share of overall exports was 
72.9 percent. 
  In the 1990-93 period, imports from West Europe went down 
only by 1 percent. In 1993, West Europe's share in Austria's 
overall imports was 74.2 percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Economic Recovery Continues"] </F>
  [Text] The economic recovery is gaining dynamism. The 
orders received in industry, the expectations of the 
entrepreneurs, and gradually also the production activity have 
improved. 
  In the first quarter, building trade developed clearly more 
positively than expected, above all because of high growth rates 
in housing construction. 
  These were the results of the latest economic inquiry by the 
Economic Research Institute (WIFO). However, the economic 
development, which has been good, as compared with Austria's 
most important trade partners, resulted in major increases in 
imports. 
  As compared with European countries, particularly the most 
important trading partners, the economic development was 
relatively favorable in the first quarter of 1994, the WIFO 
report says. Industrial production picked up and increased by 
2.9 percent, as compared with the same quarter last year. 
  In the first quarter, all exports increased by 5.4 percent 
in 
nominal terms, as compared with last year, while imports 
increased by a total of 9.5 percent. The interviews of 
entrepreneurs as part of the economic inquiry provided an 
optimistic picture. The assessment of the orders on hand has 
clearly improved. 
  The number of enterprises with free capacities is 
continuously decreasing. An increasing number of enterprises 
expects a further stimulation in the second quarter. 
  According to WIFO, the trend of a slow decrease in the 
inflation rate is continuing. The consumer price index in April 
increased by 3 percent. The cost of housing and the services 
sector continue to force an increase in prices.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Andreas Schwarz: "Clinton's Sad European </F>
Balance Sheet"] 
  [Text] The D-Day celebrations and Bill Clinton's trip to 
Europe have given rise to many historical observations. One 
could be: Europe has rarely seen a similarly colorless U.S. 
President who is more prone to attack and has as little 
substance. 
  Prone to attack: The fact that, when the leader of the last 
superpower sits beside the beautiful wife of the Italian prime 
minister, the international press only mocks the "womanizer" 
Clinton, giving the clear image of a president who has 
practically admitted to having had an affair before his 
presidency and is looking for presidential immunity in case of 
possible further accusations. There are far heavier burdens: 
"Whitewater" is still waiting for him at home and his staff is 
constantly being decimated through suicide, resignation, or 
investigations. 
  Colorless: Anyone who watched the President in Normandy -- 
how he pretended to be shocked -- who heard how he justified his 
refusal to serve in Vietnam, but regretted the lack of military 
experience (by referring to the war movies of his childhood), 
who saw what figure Bill Clinton cut in the interview with 
Francois Mitterrand, can only agree with the annoyed veterans: 
Youth is not a disgrace, but no one wants to take this paleness 
seriously. 
  Lack of substance: The fact that Bill Clinton was the first 
U.S. President since Woodrow Wilson to speak at the French 
National Assembly is the only remarkable thing about this event. 
The call for a strong Europe (as a counterpart to the 
withdrawing United States) would not have needed this historical 
frame; one would have known anyway how determined Clinton is 
about his foreign policy -- see Bosnia, China, and North Korea. 
  Lastly, the President went to Oxford to receive an honorary 
doctorate. And the renowned ECONOMIST, which once recommended 
that people vote for Clinton, received him in an editorial with 
terms such as "inconsistent," "no backbone," "embarrassing," 
and, therefore, "in the corner" out of his own fault. What can 
one add to that?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Hans Rauscher: "Clinton's D-Day"] </F>
  [Text] This week, Bill Clinton was the first U.S. 
President since Woodrow Wilson to speak at the French National 
Assembly. Wilson represents one side of U.S. policy: the good 
will to improve the world (by modeling it, if possible, along 
the lines of the U.S. example). 
  What Clinton represents is still uncertain. In any case, it 
is not the other side of U.S. world policy -- the tough 
superpower policy, oriented toward its own interests. Given his 
predisposition as a left-liberal Democrat, Clinton should rather 
be counted among the idealistic school; in reality, the 
characteristic feature of Clinton's foreign policy line is 
probably the absence of any foreign policy line. So far, he has 
exercised the leadership role that his office unavoidably forces 
on him with reticence and almost with indifference. He 
hesitates to use the power of the United States seriously -- 
even if the matter at hand is a serious threat. 
  Obviously, Clinton has real problems with power. 
  The explanation for that lies in his background as a member 
of the anti-Vietnam generation. His formative years were 
characterized by the disproportionate, senseless, and ultimately 
unsuccessful use of U.S. means of power. 
  Clinton experiences the abuse of U.S. power, not its use for 
a just cause. 
  The experience of the D-Day celebrations this week may have 
had a bit of a correcting effect. One cannot think of any more 
honorable cause in history than the defeat of a real empire of 
evil, as Hitler's Germany was. Without the United States this 
would not have been possible, and Stalin, too, would have had to 
accept an arrangement with Hitler. 
  The question is how important Europe still is for Clinton's 
administration. Assurances, also in his speech in Paris, are 
one thing, real inclinations and interests are another. 
Clinton's people have repeatedly announced a shift of their 
focus from Europe to Asia. This need not yet worry the 
Europeans; the focal points of this administration are 
constantly shifting. On the other hand, the "ad-hoc-ery" of 
Clinton's team is certainly extremely worrying. 
  Whenever the Americans believed that they could neglect 
Europe, things developed toward a disaster. In World War I, the 
Americans saved Europe from a German victory. Their fresh 
troops, who reinforced the completely exhausted English and 
French troops on the Western Front, prevented the success of the 
last great German offensive. In 1918, the United States 
withdrew, however, from Europe into total isolation -- to the 
detriment of Europe, which succumbed to the unchecked aggression 
of Hitler's Germany and had to be liberated again with enormous 
sacrifice. 
  This time the U.S. leadership was smarter: It not only 
supported reconstruction with its Marshall Plan, but also 
repulsed the Soviet attempts to take in those countries where 
the Red Army was not deployed: In 1948, the Berlin blockade, 
military support for the anticommunists in the Greek civil war, 
support for Tito's anti- Moscow course, financial support for 
the democratic parties in France and Italy; in 1950, support for 
the anticommunist forces at the half-hearted putsch attempt in 
Vienna and eastern Austria; in the late 1950's and early 1960's, 
the repulsion of various crises in Berlin; in the late 1970's, 
rearmament against the threat of Soviet intermediate-range 
missiles. 
  The U.S. shield kept the Russians out and -- what is perhaps 
more important -- prevented the Soviet Union from being able to 
force the free Europeans into submission by means of a military 
threat. 
  The U.S. interests certainly played a role in this: If the 
Soviet Union had received full and unhindered access to Western 
technology and Western capital through an intimidated West 
Europe, it would not have lagged behind so enormously in its 
development. The internal collapse could have been prevented or 
at least delayed for a long time (the USSR was able to survive 
as long as it did only through extensive industrial espionage). 
  Basically, even Stalin and his successors were not so 
interested in getting West Europe physically under the control 
of the Red Army. They would have been satisfied with turning 
West Europe and, above all, West Germany into a client state, 
included in the Soviet system of exploitation. It was in the 
Americans' strategic interest to prevent the Soviet Union from 
grabbing West Europe's potential and thus from becoming a far 
more dangerous rival. 
  And today it is in the interest of the United States to 
prevent the same thing from happening in connection with Russia. 
  The question is whether the path that Clinton is taking in 
this connection, namely integrating Russia as much as possible 
into European policy, is the correct one. In Bosnia, Russia has 
already been given a veto right. Perhaps things could not have 
been done differently. 
  However, Clinton's readiness to extend the so-called NATO 
Partnership for Peace to Russia is being viewed with concern. 
During his visit to NATO headquarters, Russian Defense Minister 
Grachev tried to bring NATO under the supreme authority of the 
CSCE, which would mean a de facto veto right for the Russians 
over NATO. It would be, as Henry Kissinger warns, "the 
emasculation of NATO, which has been a goal of Russian foreign 
policy for 45 years." 
  Clinton's seeming readiness to give Russia special status in 
NATO is alarming, not only to tough Realpolitik experts like 
Kissinger but even more so to the East European reform states, 
which finally want to get out of Moscow's sphere of influence. 
This is so important because NATO is the decisive and almost 
only institutional link between the United States and Europe. 
If NATO becomes a watered-down association with a Russian veto, 
then one has to be extremely worried about everything that D-Day 
meant 50 years ago.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Jos Huypens: "European Elections Were Not a </F>
National Test"] 
  [Text] The European elections in Belgium clearly have their 
own dynamic and cannot be viewed as a test of the national 
political situation. The majority parties in Flanders did not 
suffer big losses compared with the November 1991 national 
elections. And the parties which had made national politics the 
issue in these elections scored badly in comparison with 1991. 
  In any case it was striking that the parties which at first 
used the European elections to render a verdict on the national 
elections, changed tack as the evening continued and eagerly 
reached for the results of the 1989 European elections. 
  In addition, on the national level, these elections did not 
see the expected breakthrough of the blue wave of the VLD 
[Flemish Liberal Democrats] nor a further massive increase for 
the VB [Flemish Block]. 
  In comparison with previous European elections, the rise of 
the single issue parties was confirmed. WOW [Getting Old With 
Dignity] did strikingly well and the VB climbed a few percentage 
points. Thorough analysis will have to establish whether this 
time WOW picked up the protest votes which went to Rossem before. 
  The winners in the European election campaign compared with 
1989 are WOW, the VB and to a lesser degree the VLD. The 
biggest losers were the CVP [Christian People's Party], SP 
[Flemish Socialist Party] and Agalev [Flemish Greens]. Another 
striking aspect is that the VU [People's Union] managed to hold 
its position. However, the percentage changes find very little 
expression in how the seats in the European Parliament are 
divided. 
  The most striking point in these European elections is the 
large degree of absenteeism in countries where voting is not 
obligatory and the considerable lack of enthusiasm among voters 
in countries where voting is obligatory. This is the biggest 
challenge for the newly elected candidates: To translate Europe 
to voters in a more comprehensible way. 
  One piece of good news is the massive Austrian "yes" vote 
for 
membership in the European Union [EU]. Perhaps the countries 
which are not yet members have a better understanding of what 
the extra benefits of a united Europe can be. Probably we must 
return to the EU's basic principles, rather than lose ourselves 
in petty discussions which have little to do with the essence of 
unification.

<F P=106> [Article by Mia Doornaert: "No Special Status in PFP for </F>
Russia"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] There was unanimous agreement 
among the 16 foreign ministers on the utmost importance of 
maximum Russian involvement in European security. NATO hopes 
that Russia will soon sign the Partnership for Peace [PFP] 
Agreement, without any pre-conditions. 
  For the 16 it is clear that the contents of this Partnership 
for Peace agreement must include a dimension which reflects 
Russia's status as a major power. In addition, the alliance is 
also seeking a "broad dialogue" with Russia "in areas where 
Russia can make a unique and/or particularly important 
contribution." 
  One of these areas, in addition to peacekeeping, is the 
prevention of the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass 
destruction, on the subject of which NATO ministers yesterday 
issued a separate policy document. 
  Equally unanimously, the 16 also sent out the signal that 
wide-ranging dialogue with Russia would not be allowed to 
compromise the freedom to maneuver of either NATO or the 
countries of Central and East Europe. 
  A number of "parameters" which Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel 
Grachev proposed to NATO at the end of last month have therefore 
been cast aside. There is no question of Russia's automatic 
participation in NATO consultations. Neither -- as German 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel expressly stated -- can there be 
any question of Russia's right to veto NATO decisions, including 
any possible NATO enlargement, or of a NATO and Russian 
"directorate" on European security. The Russian proposal to 
render NATO subject to the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe was also firmly rejected. 
<H5>  Bosnia </H5>
  As for Bosnia -- the second major item on the agenda -- the 
NATO countries called for an "immediate and general stop to the 
fighting," the placing of UN troops between the warring parties, 
and a political settlement which "gives the Bosnian-Croatian 
federation a sustainable, realistic and fair territorial area." 
The alliance also wants Bosnia-Herzegovina to continue to exist 
as a "Union with internationally recognized borders," and thus 
no annexation of the Bosnian Serbs within a Greater Serbia. 
  The fact that the communique attaches "special importance" 
to 
respect for all disarmament accords, and in particular the 
"complete implementation" of the CFE [Conventional Armed Forces 
in Europe] Treaty is in accordance with Turkish concerns. 
  Signed in 1990, the CFE Treaty provides for a major 
reduction 
in conventional weapons by both NATO countries and former Warsaw 
pact countries. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia had to 
negotiate with the other republics on how to divide the agreed 
upon quotas and zones. Russia now wants to review agreements 
with the Caucasian republics of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, 
allowing Russia more troops and weapons in the region and the 
republics fewer. 
  Turkey will not hear of such a strengthening of Russian 
military strength in the region. Seen from Brussels, the 
nearest Russian division may now be four times further away than 
a few years ago, but the constant passage of Russian ships 
through the Bosporus is a reminder that for Turkey -- as for 
Norway, also located on NATO's flank -- the distance has changed 
much less dramatically. 
  It was not for nothing that a senior Turkish diplomat here 
warned that NATO should not be too quick to take Russia on board 
with a special relationship. "That would be like taking an 
elephant on board a boat. You either have to totally 
redistribute the weight or it will immediately capsize and sink."

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Ominous Elections"] </F>
  [Text] The Austrians took part en masse in the referendum 
on membership of the European Union [EU] and agreed to the entry 
treaty by an unexpectedly high percentage of around 66 percent. 
This Austrian "yes" increases the chance that this year not just 
the Finns, but also the more sceptical Swedes and Norwegians 
will join the EU. 
  The Austrians rightly listened to the arguments of the 
government, employers and trade unions, namely that membership 
is good for the economy and national security. Rejecting the 
treaty would have isolated Austria and therefore made it 
vulnerable. 
  The Austrian "yes" seems to be in opposition to the 
half-hearted and dull election campaign for the European 
Parliament in those countries which are already members of the 
EU. But this contradiction is above all one of appearance. The 
EU certainly has its faults, but it is undeniably an area of 
peace, stability and welfare. This and the single market are 
very attractive to European countries outside the EU. 
  In the member states themselves these acquisitions are taken 
for granted. In essence the big parties do not differ in their 
opinions regarding the usefulness of European cooperation. And 
if there are serious differences in opinion, then they cut 
through the parties, like in the British Conservatives and the 
French Gaullists. Moreover no one is enthusiastic about that 
distant parliament in Strasbourg. 
  The result has been that in many EU countries national 
themes 
came to the forefront and the European elections were 
transformed into national polls. 
  On Sunday [12 June] this led above all to disappointment for 
the German Social Democrats. Their expectations of winning the 
parliamentary elections this autumn received a serious setback. 
The CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] 
did surprisingly well and won. 
  According to the forecasts, the Spanish socialists suffered 
their first defeat since 1982. Prime Minister Gonzalez was 
presented with the bill for the recent corruption scandals in 
government and the public authorities. And after Sunday the 
French Socialists seem to have very little chance of winning 
next year's presidential elections. 
  However, all this has little to do with the legitimacy of 
the 
European Parliament, which has certainly not increased with 
these elections. Europe will have to be a far more central 
issue in future European elections. 
  This requires that the EU countries allow the formation of 
European parties and make the European parliament truly 
representative of the people. If they are not prepared to do 
so, then there is a danger that the European Parliament could 
wither definitively to an institution with as little power as it 
has respect.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION </F>
Political Staff] 
  [Text] A jubilant Labour Party was today celebrating its 
sweeping gains in the European elections, hailing a "triumph and 
great victory." As Labour took more seats today, party leader 
Margaret Beckett denied that they had peaked too soon. "We gave 
Mr Major and his whole Government notice to quit. The electors 
are giving them notice to quit," she told a London news 
conference. The mantle of trust had passed to Labour. "Where 
we need the votes to win a general election we are getting them." 
  But the Tories insisted their fortunes were at a turning 
point. "This represents the trough of our fortunes," said 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. The results were "poor, but not 
disastrous." Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 Committee of 
Tory backbenchers, moved to dispel speculation that the Tories' 
humiliation would lead to a leadership contest. He conceded 
that the results were a "setback" but added: "Let me just make 
this absolutely clear. John Major is our Prime Minister and he 
will remain so." 
  With only a few seats still to declare, the Tories had just 
16, with 13 losses, and the Liberal Democrats won their first 
two seats ever in the European Parliament. Their leader Paddy 
Ashdown said they had achieved their target of capturing between 
one and three seats. "We have achieved that target. We have 
increased our vote in every single constituency across the 
country," he said. 
  The Tories slumped to less than 28 percent of the vote, 
their 
lowest ever in a national election, while Labour had a massive 
45 percent. The Liberal Democrats were well behind their recent 
opinion poll ratings, on 17 percent. 
  With the Tories' losses in double figures, Mr Major will 
face 
strong demands for a wholesale Cabinet reshuffle in which John 
Patten, the Education Secretary, would almost certainly be one 
of the casualties. 
  In Scotland the Tory vote plunged to a humiliating 14 
percent 
as Labour strengthened its already dominant position, winning 
all the seats so far declared. But with two seats due to 
declare later today, the jubilant Scottish National Party was 
hoping to snatch North East Scotland from Labour and break 
through the crucial 30 percent of the vote barrier. 
  Mr Ashdown said the Lib-Dems [Liberal Democrats] were going 
to look at the result in the Devon and Plymouth Euro 
constituency where a "Literal Democrat" may have robbed them of 
victory. Tory Giles Chichester -- son of round-the-world 
yachtsman Sir Francis Chichester -- beat Liberal Democrat Adrian 
Sanders into second place by just 700 votes following a recount 
after "Literal Democrat" Richard Huggett polled 10,203 votes. 
  Labour Party chairman David Blunkett declared: "Labour is 
the 
only truly national party now." He added: "These superb results 
confirm that Labour is not only on course to defeat the 
Conservatives in the General Election, but has finally laid to 
rest the Liberal Democrat myth that Labour cannot win in the 
South of England." 
  As Labour and the Liberal Democrats blamed each other for 
preventing further Tories losses, Mr Blunkett said: "If the 
Tories hadn't been rescued by the Liberal Democrats in Thames 
Valley, Sussex South and Crawley, and the Cotswolds, they would 
have suffered an even worse humiliation than they did in the 
end."

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Text] The Prime Minister acknowledged today that the 
Tories had "very poor results" in a very low poll in the 
European election. 
  Giving what is believed to be the first news conference in 
the garden of 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister said that 
two-thirds of the electorate simply did not bother to vote and 
the turnout in Britain and in other EU [European Union] 
countries was "frankly derisory." 
  But he insisted: "I intend to stick to what I set out to do 
because I passionately believe it is in the long-term benefit of 
this country." 
  He also promised that with the co-operation of the 
opposition 
parties the Government hoped to make progress on reforming the 
way the House of Commons conducted its business before the 
summer recess. 
  The Prime Minister, speaking in warm sunshine, went through 
the Government's programme both implemented and planned. 
  He said the results, although poor, were a good deal better 
than almost anybody had predicted. "The opinion polls have been 
discredited again," he said. "It has been clear for some years 
that many people are simply not frank when asked questions by 
opinion pollsters. I expect they resent the prying nature of 
the questions." 
  He added: "It is apparent that many people are still both 
angry and bruised as a result of the recession. That has 
happened here in the UK as it has happened right across Europe." 
  He said that governing parties in Denmark, France, Greece, 
Ireland, Spain and Portugal had all enjoyed a smaller share of 
the vote than in their last general elections. 
  "In the United Kingdom we are firmly back into growth but 
that is clearly not yet the general perception of the public. 
Many people simply declined to vote on this occasion." 
  Mr Major: "`Not this time' was the frequent message on the 
doorstep." 
  He said there was irritation with all politicians, certainly 
directed at the Government. 
  The elections were held at a time uniquely favourable to the 
Labour Party. In an apparent reference to the death of Labour 
leader John Smith, he said some of the reasons were sad, which 
everyone understood. 
  Describing the failure of the Liberals to make any advances, 
Mr Major said: "We are back into the politics of clear choice. 
The only alternative to a Conservative government is a Labour 
government. Any other choice is a good spoiler but unreal. 
  "We are now back into economic growth and this is going to 
continue. I am confident we will meet our growth forecasts. We 
have the lowest inflation since the 1960s and I am confident we 
will meet inflation targets. Unemployment has fallen 
consistently and I am confident that will go on." 
  Mr Major: "We will continue to pursue long-term policies 
that 
we believe will lead to success for this country." 
  Asked about a leadership challenge, the Prime Minister 
declared: "I am still here. We have a mechanism if people wish 
to challenge in the autumn -- that's a matter for them. I don't 
expect one. I will be here waiting for it if there is one. I 
will beat it and I will be here through and through the general 
election." 
  Mr Major went on to claim that Labour had shown they would 
prefer to spend people's money themselves than to cut taxes. 
But he said of the Tory Party: "If and when it is prudent to 
cut taxes in the future, our instinct will be to cut them. I 
would rather let people decide for themselves how to spend their 
money than we should decide on their behalf." 
  Questioned over claims by some MPs that the Tory European 
manifesto had been too Euro sceptic, Mr Major said: "I am not 
bowing either to the Euro enthusiasts or the Euro sceptics. I 
am saying and doing precisely what I believe is right for 
Europe." 
  On a Cabinet reshuffle, Mr Major said: "There will be one. 
It isn't imminent. I think there are appropriate times to hold 
a reshuffle both in terms of good management and in terms of man 
management." 
  Asked by one reporter whether he had at any time during the 
European election campaign considered resigning, Mr Major 
replied confidently: "The question didn't cross my mind." 
  Mr Major said governments across Europe had experienced a 
"mid-term dip in popularity" and a general election could be up 
to three years away in the UK. People tended to "protest less 
and move back to their natural home" as a general election 
approached.

<F P=106> [By Joe Quinn, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Text] A Palestinian's claim that he was responsible for 
the Lockerbie bombing was today greeted with scepticism by 
British relatives of the 270 victims. Yusuf Sha'ban, 29, made 
the outburst in a Beirut courtroom where he is standing trial 
accused of assassinating a Jordanian diplomat in Beirut in 
January. "I personally blew up the Lockerbie plane," Sha'ban, a 
follower of terrorist chief Abu Nidal, told the court today. 
"I've told the investigating magistrate about it before, but my 
confession wasn't documented. I say it again now," said 
Sha'ban, of Abu Nidal's Fatah Revolutionary Council. 
  If Sha'ban's claim is to be taken literally, it would appear 
to question the Western case that the bombing was carried out by 
two Libyans who have yet to surrender for trial in Scotland or 
the United States. But British relatives' spokesman Dr. Jim 
Swire said today that neither he nor others involved in the 
tragedy had heard of Sha'ban before. 
  "His claim should be regarded with grave suspicion," said 
Dr. 
Swire, whose daughter Flora was one of the 270 people killed 
when a terrorist bomb brought down the PanAm jumbo jet over 
Lockerbie. 
  "It could be that he is seeking to attract what terrorists 
might regard as kudos for the Abu Nidal organisation, for all I 
know." 
  Until a trial took place of the two Libyans, it was 
impossible to say who was involved, said Dr. Swire. "In the 
absence of that trial, all claims deserve to be looked at -- but 
they should equally be treated with grave suspicion." 
  And the Foreign Office in London said: "As we have said many 
times in the past, we believe there is a case to be answered in 
a court in Scotland or the United States by the two Libyans. If 
anyone has further information which implicates anyone else, 
this could be brought to the attention of the Lord Advocate in 
Scotland or the U.S. authorities." 
  In Scotland, a spokesman for the Crown Office said the Lord 
Advocate had seen no evidence relating to "the alleged 
involvement" of Sha'ban. 
  "If anyone has any evidence relating to the case, they 
should 
make it available to the Dumfries and Galloway constabulary," 
the spokesman added.

<F P=106> [Report by Patrick Bishop: "Government Rejects New </F>
Lockerbie `Confession'"] 
  [Text] A claim by a member of a Palestinian terror group 
that he was responsible for the Lockerbie bombing was discounted 
by the Foreign Office yesterday. 
  Yusuf Sha'ban, 29, who is accused of involvement in the 
murder of a Jordanian diplomat, told a Beirut court he blew up 
the Pan Am airliner which exploded over Scotland in December 
1988 killing 270 people. 
  Sha'ban is a member of the Fatah Revolutionary Council, the 
Palestinian terror organisation led by Abu-Nidal. 
  But yesterday a Foreign Office spokesman said: "We have 
stated many times we believe that there is a case to be answered 
in a court in Scotland or the US involving two Libyans." 
  Mr Jim Swire, a spokesman for British relatives of the 
victims of flight 103, said the claim "should be regarded with 
grave suspicion." 
  He added: "It could be that he is seeking to attract what 
terrorists might regard as kudos for the Abu-Nidal organisation." 
  The belief that Libya is to blame for the bombing was 
repeated by Mrs Stella Rimington, the director-general of MI5, 
in the Dimbleby Lecture on Sunday [12 June]. Both Britain and 
the United States are demanding that Libya hand over the two 
suspects, 'Abd-al-Basit 'Ali al-Migrahi and Lamin Khalifah 
Fuhaymah, for trial in either country. 
  The Abu-Nidal group has close links with Libya, but 
officials 
say it has not been identified with the Lockerbie atrocity. Nor 
is the name of Sha'ban well known to the security sources. 
  Sha'ban claimed in court he had repeatedly told the 
magistrate investigating the assassination that he was the 
Lockerbie bomber but his claim had never been recorded. 
  Yesterday the likeliest explanation for his "confession" was 
thought to be a desire to delay a possible death sentence in his 
current trial. He and two others are charged with killing Na'ib 
'Imran Ma'ayitah in Beirut in January. 
  Lebanon has recently begun carrying out the death penalty 
for 
murderers. 
  Another theory is that Sha'ban was acting on Abu-Nidal's 
orders to try to divert attention from his patron Col 
Al-Qadhdhafi, whose Libyan regime has suffered two years of 
sanctions over his refusal to give up the suspects.

<F P=106> [Editorial report: "How To Deal With Iran"] </F>
  [Text] "The revolution is not about the price of a 
watermelon," declared Ayatollah Khomeyni of the creation of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. Any hopes that such ardour might cool 
with time have again been dashed in recent weeks. Like a poor 
man's Communist International, the Iranians still seek to export 
revolution and violence across the globe. This was most 
recently exemplified by the crude forgeries of British 
Government correspondence on Bosnia -- in an attempt to prove 
anti-Muslim bias -- which triggered the round of Anglo-Iranian 
diplomatic expulsions. Along with Cuba, Iraq, Libya and North 
Korea, Iran not only chooses to remain outside the family of 
nations, but also assaults its basic values. While all these 
countries lack the resources of a superpower, they share a siege 
mentality that prompts them to acquire weapons of mass 
destruction -- as Iranian funding for the North Korean Rodong 
missile programme so chillingly demonstrates. 
  In Iran's case such behaviour is, of course, always affected 
by the regime's internal power struggles. Divisions between the 
pragmatists led by President Rafsanjani and the radicals led by 
the spiritual leader, Ali Khamene'i, endure; indeed, far from 
being a figment of Western imagination the distinction between 
the two camps is made by the Iranians themselves. In the West 
there is a general belief that it should be easier to treat with 
the "pragmatists." But if anything, it might in fact be easier 
to live with the religious radicals, because they are less 
interested in the non-Muslim world. By contrast, the 
pragmatists pay far greater attention to Iran's strategic 
interests. Merely because they believe that Iran and Islam 
cannot triumph through spiritual elan alone, and require Western 
capital and technology to accomplish their ends, does not make 
them easier partners. 
  But the truth is that neither faction is as concerned with 
foreign policy as many in the West suppose; to be seen publicly 
to undo any segment of Ayatollah Khomeyni's legacy is to court 
disaster, and so Iran's overseas adventurism continues as though 
on autopilot. The Clinton Administration's policy has been one 
of "dual containment" towards both Iran and Iraq, based on the 
assumption that as long as Iran is kept weak there will be no 
need to depend on Iraq to contain it. Pressure on Iran should 
be maintained, especially as the Iranians are vulnerable 
following the halving of their oil revenues since the Gulf war. 
Britain, for its part, should join America in pressing for an 
end to concessional finance and the transfer of high technology 
goods, even if countries such as France and Germany are willing 
to soft-pedal their differences with Iran over terrorism for 
short-sighted commercial and political gain.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and </F>
FDP chairman, by Hans-Joachim Wiese -- live] 
  [Text] [Wiese] I now welcome Klaus Kinkel, Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] chairman and FRG foreign 
minister. Good morning, Mr. Kinkel. 
  [Kinkel] Good morning. 
  [Wiese] Mr. Kinkel, your party is regarded as the major 
loser of this election. How do you explain the defeat? 
  [Kinkel] Undoubtedly, this is a disappointing result for us. 
Unfortunately, we do not have such thick cushions as the other 
big parties, so that a relatively small loss immediately leads 
us into turbulence. Yet it would have been so important for us 
if the FDP had been represented again in the European Parliament. 
  Well, what is the reason? I feel that we simply did not 
succeed in convincing a sufficient number of voters of the need 
for liberals in the European Parliament. Of course, we will 
have to examine whether we have made mistakes. We will do this 
in the committees today. The course that we have taken will be 
continued. We will not change it. We never achieved phenomenal 
results in European elections. Unfortunately, I add. Sometimes 
we got in, sometimes we had to get out -- the changes were 
rather abrupt. This time, we are out again. We have to look 
forward and primarily concentrate on the Bundestag election, but 
also on the Landtag and municipal elections that lie ahead of 
us. I am sure that we will be successful again. 
  [Wiese] How do you assess the interpretation of the bad 
result for your party that the FDP simply does not have a sharp 
profile or a liberal profile, but leans too much on the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU], the big coalition partner? 
  [Kinkel] I think that it is not right because we conducted a 
Europe-oriented election campaign. Apparently -- I noticed this 
in my numerous meetings -- the people are not very interested in 
this Europe. Perhaps it was wrong that we concentrated too much 
on it. At our party congress in Rostock last weekend, we 
developed a program with a sharp profile, with which we will 
also enter the Bundestag election campaign. As for the rest, we 
have a coalition with the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] and 
we said -- which, in my opinion, is still right -- that we will 
continue this coalition because we have done a good job. We 
will do this. I say it once again: As far as the last results 
are concerned, we always gained twice as much as in the European 
elections or even more than that. Nevertheless, matters must not 
be minced. Just for my first anniversary as party chairman, I 
would have wished for better results. 
  [Wiese] FDP Deputy Chairwoman Irmgard Schwaetzer said that 
the reasons for the FDP losses are the discussion on people with 
higher incomes and the fact that the FDP's clear coalition 
statement for the CDU/CSU in the government has not been used to 
present the FDP as an independent force. 
  [Kinkel] Well, what slipped into the draft of our election 
program regarding the people with higher incomes was not good. 
We corrected it. We are a party that also admits mistakes. 
This certainly did not help us. However, I do not believe that 
it greatly harmed us in the European election. Nevertheless, we 
have to examine, of course, whether this may happen again in the 
future. It will not be possible to rule this out completely, 
just as in other parties. 
  Regarding the other reasons that Mrs. Schwaetzer mentioned, 
I 
would not take the same point of view. We have -- I must repeat 
it -- our own profile; we will continue our own election 
campaign. In the past, we were also often in turbulence and 
difficult situations. The FDP always recovered from it. I am 
not trying to mince matters, but I am sure that we will preserve 
the necessary motivation thrust for the Bundestag election. 
Then we will see. Personally, I learned to lose in sports. 
One also has to live with ups and downs in politics. I say it 
once again: We do not have such a thick cushion as the big 
parties. Our existence is always threatened. I hope that we 
will overcome this low. At any rate, we will stick to the 
course that we have taken. 
  [Wiese] Keyword Bundestag election, Mr. Kinkel. If you were 
to make a forecast for this election result, what would it be 
like? 
  [Kinkel] For my party? 
  [Wiese] Yes. 
  [Kinkel] I have just said it. As a prelude to the Bundestag 
election, I would have wished for a better result in this 
European election, which is something else but, of course, 
noteworthy. However, things are added up in the end. It is 
encouraging for me that the extreme Right did not have a chance. 
I think that the results of the PDS [Party of Democratic 
Socialism] are very alarming. Of course, one also has to see 
the European Parliament in its overall make-up. If I see things 
correctly, not much has changed. It is, of course, pleasing 
that the CDU/CSU, our potential partner, has achieved very good 
results. We, as the FDP, will have to get going. 
  [Wiese] Mr. Kinkel, perhaps a word about the referendum in 
Austria, which ended with a surprisingly high degree of 
agreement to Austria's entry. How do you assess this as foreign 
minister? 
  [Kinkel] Well, this is extremely pleasing. I won a major 
bet. Austrian Foreign Minister Mock called me yesterday. My 
contribution to this result was not insignificant. This is 
something that makes one somewhat bitter. Regarding Europe's 
development in the postwar period, we Free Democrats have done 
much: Scheel, Genscher, Kinkel in the past two years. 
Apparently, the people have not paid tribute to it. At any 
rate, we were not able to translate our reputation outside into 
good results in the European Parliament elections. This is 
something that makes me somewhat bitter and sad because all the 
efforts paid off outside, but not at all for us within the 
country. 
  [Wiese] What can Austria's special contribution to the 
European Union be? 
  [Kinkel] Austria will be a benefit for this union in every 
respect, politically, economically, and culturally. The country 
is a net payer, it belongs to us. It was not in vain that I 
struggled so much for it and I was also right about the 
referendum. I anticipated a high degree of agreement and I was 
right.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Richard von Weizsaecker by Michael </F>
H. Spreng and F. Weckbach-Mara in Bonn; date not given: "What 
Will You Do When You Are Retired, Mr. President?"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [BILD AM SONNTAG] What are 
the political issues that you will be dealing with in the future? 
  [Weizsaecker] The priority of my political work has always 
been connected with overcoming the division of Berlin, Germany, 
and Europe. After the unification of Germany, the next item on 
the agenda will be the inclusion of the free and democratic 
nations of Central, Eastern, and southeastern Europe. It is no 
coincidence that my last trip as president will be to Warsaw. 
Poland is among the countries whose history, culture, and 
values are just as European as that of our western neighbors and 
ourselves. The unification of Europe will take a long time, but 
it is a very significant historic process. I feel particularly 
committed to that process. Another priority is the future of 
the United Nations. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] It has been said that you have been 
specifically asked by the UN secretary general.... 
  [Weizsaecker] Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has asked a 
group of 12 people to present proposals for the reform of the 
United Nations in the summer of 1995 on the occasion of the 
organization's 50th birthday. I am chairman of that group with 
former Pakistani Prime Minister Qureshie. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Are you also dissatisfied with UN peace 
missions, like the one in Somalia, and with inaction in the case 
of Rwanda? 
  [Weizsaecker] At the moment, the world community does not 
have the necessary instruments to fulfill its peace task. But 
who is responsible for this situation? Not the organization of 
the United Nations but the lack of political will, especially on 
the part of important member countries. The secretary general 
very emphatically asked for means to help Rwanda, yet in vain. 
This is just one of the examples that have made him demand that 
the United Nations should have forces at its disposal when 
needed. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Do you share this view and do you expect 
Germany to participate in the future? 
  [Weizsaecker] I share the secretary general's view. As to 
our country, we have to take the obligations of a member state 
seriously. We cannot expect the United Nations to be capable of 
acting and responsible for peace on the one hand while refusing 
to participate in enforcing it on the other. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Will Germany then be given a permanent 
seat on the UN Security Council? 
  [Weizsaecker] First, Germany will probably be voted into the 
Security Council as a temporary member for two years as of 1 
January 1995. The future permanent composition of the Security 
Council will then have to be decided in a reform of the United 
Nations, which will certainly not be restricted to Germany. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] What sort of reform? 
  [Weizsaecker] First of all, the United Nations must be 
strengthened in terms of funds, supplies, organization, and 
logistics. The Germans are providing much more support in these 
fields today than other important countries. Of course, the 
United Nations is not heading toward a world government with a 
world police force. Conflicts will not stop nor will violence. 
Events like the ones in Rwanda, where we as a community of 
states have failed, are no reason to condemn the United Nations. 
They are a signal to wake up in order to enable it to act more 
efficiently than it has done in the past. 
  I would, however, warn against seeing the activities of the 
United Nations exclusively against the background of avoiding or 
ending military conflicts. Living conditions in the north are 
still completely different from the south. In addition to a 
lack of justice, deprivation, and starvation, overpopulation and 
the dangers to our environment are the major tasks of today. 
They will determine the course of the reforms. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by F. Weckbach-Mara: "Nuclear Mafia: BND </F>
Powerless?"] 
  [Text] For a few weeks now, Russian mafia organizations 
have been in possession of the most important components for 
constructing nuclear bombs. They are thus in a position to 
blackmail Western and Arab countries. This follows from secret 
reports for the Federal Government. According to information 
received by BILD AM SONNTAG, this hot topic was discussed on the 
sidelines of a Cabinet meeting last Wednesday [8 June]. 
  Bernd Schmidbauer, minister of state in the Chancellery 
responsible for coordinating the secret services, told BILD AM 
SONNTAG: "There is a serious danger that criminal organizations 
can perform blackmail with highly toxic radioactive material. 
Therefore it is time for us to act." Western secret services 
fear that before long, mafia organizations will threaten to 
detonate smaller nuclear bombs or release highly toxic 
radioactive material. 
  U.S. President Clinton has already undertaken serious 
defense 
measures. In two weeks, the American FBI will open a bureau in 
Moscow to combat the nuclear mafia with the Russians. The 
Federal German Intelligence Service [BND] wants to participate 
in this cooperation, but Minister Schmidbauer says that 
important legal prerequisites for this are missing. "BND 
employees cannot examine radioactive material, nor bring it to 
Germany for examination," he says. "Yet accurate analyses are 
essential to assess and offset dangers. 
  "We require changes to the ratification law dealing with the 
physical protection of nuclear material, as well as an amendment 
to the nuclear law requiring nuclear material to be handled in 
this country," said Schmidbauer. "To offset major dangers to 
our country, we must participate as quickly as possible in the 
international combating of antimafia organizations, especially 
in Russia and East Europe."

<F P=106> ["hjs" report: "Bonn Plans Help for `Eco-Jumbo'"] </F>
  [Text] The government wants to assist the development of a 
new generation of wide-body aircraft that could replace the 
Airbus and Boeing 747 one day. The aircraft, which are meant to 
emit exceptionally little exhaust fumes, consume less fuel, and 
be very quiet in operation, are privately referred to as 
"Eco-Jumbos." 
  This assistance is to form part of an aviation research and 
technology program that is in the planning stage. However, the 
financial aspects of this program are a subject of dispute. At 
a meeting with Friedrich Bohl, minister in the Chancellery, the 
chiefs of the state and senate chancelleries failed to reach 
agreement with each other on this subject. The laender are 
demanding at least 1 billion marks [DM] worth of support for the 
suffering aviation industry for 1994-98. The Ministry of 
Research supports this demand, but stipulates a new time period 
for the program, 1995-99. The ministry wishes to administer the 
program. 
  Reinhard Goehner, the government's air and space 
coordinator, 
told HANDELSBLATT that the size of financial assistance would be 
decided later, during financial consultations. But among 
government circles there is talk of a maximum of DM750 million, 
or DM150 per year. In addition, strong participation by the 
laender is called for.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Christoph Bertram: "Playing With the Bomb"] </F>
  [Text] There is talk about war again, possibly even 
nuclear war. Such talk may be exaggerated, premature, or 
perhaps even totally out of place, and some people may find 
comfort in the thought that it refers to a distant region in 
northeastern Asia, the Korean Peninsula. But once before, at 
the beginning of the Cold War, a Korean war shook the world. 
This time, too, we should let ourselves be deceived: The 
conflict simmering there now is explosive enough to rouse us 
from our self-contemplation. 
  The talk about war has been caused by North Korea's refusal 
-- even though it is a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty -- to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
to fully inspect all its nuclear facilities. Since the spring 
of 1993, the regime in Pyongyang has fooled the inspectors. It 
is true that, following tough negotiations, they were 
occasionally admitted into the country, but they were never 
permitted to carry out the decisive inspection, namely, examine 
how much plutonium had been secretly extracted and put aside. 
In these weeks, the North Koreans are hurriedly exchanging the 
fuel rods in their nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, obviously in an 
intention to definitely thwart such examination. 
  Since then, the world has increasingly been calling for 
economic sanctions. The North Korean "Committee for the 
Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland," a mouthpiece of the 
regime, has threatened that "sanctions mean war, and war is 
merciless." 
  Optimists are trying to persuade people that this is just 
bluff, and North Korea does not want war or the bomb. They say 
that the regime of the country, which is isolated, economically 
ruined, and overshadowed by uncertainty about the successor to 
the old Stalinist ruler, Kim Il-song, is only seeking 
international recognition and support to stand its ground 
against the successful south and avoid the fate of the GDR. 
  Granted, no one can say with certainty today whether the 
country already has some atom bombs, whether it intends to build 
them or can build them. However, the optimistic assessments 
meanwhile increasingly resemble broken straws, because there is 
no doubt that, despite all its efforts to hush up this fact, 
North Korea has long pursued a nuclear arms program. Following 
its recent move to sabotage inspection, it now even has an 
opportunity to secretly extract sufficient fissionable material 
for half a dozen nuclear weapons; more efficient reactors are 
already under construction. If the North considered the bomb 
only a barter object to win the largest possible international 
support, there would probably have been enough opportunities in 
recent months for such a barter deal. The United States, Japan, 
and South Korea all said they would be willing to make 
concessions if the IAEA inspectors could do their job unhindered. 
  That is why North Korea's behavior suggests a much gloomier 
assumption. The country wants the bomb, it has only used the 
negotiations to cover up its intention to continue and step up 
its efforts. This concretely shows a dual danger. First, other 
countries in the region -- Japan, Taiwan, South Korea -- could 
follow the North Korean example, and the region could be driven 
into a nuclear arms race. Second, elsewhere, would-be nuclear 
powers could feel encouraged. The Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty would be nothing but a scrap of paper. 
  Therefore, what is happening in Korea is not an Asian 
crisis; 
it is an international crisis. What should be done to cope with 
it? Economic sanctions are not an appropriate instrument; they 
are rather an expression of embarrassment. Even if China and 
Russia in the UN Security Council agreed to an embargo 
resolution, and even if subsequently China and Japan, the key 
states, energetically carried out the embargo -- both cases are 
more than uncertain -- this could not force North Korea to stop 
its nuclear arms production. Military sanctions, which U.S. 
Defense Secretary Perry does not rule out, could destroy North 
Korea's visible nuclear facilities, but they could not destroy 
the bomb, if it exists at all, because it can be easily hidden. 
Then there would only be the certainty of war. 
  Instead of threatening sanctions and rattling the saber, 
the world should therefore remember that confrontation has never 
made a country give up its nuclear arms plans -- on the 
contrary. The fact that the number of nuclear arms states is 
today much smaller than had been predicted by experts several 
years ago is not attributable to the displeasure of other 
countries, but to the realization of possible nuclear candidates 
that the development of their own bombs is unnecessary or even 
harmful for their security -- Argentina and Brazil, which 
discontinued their bomb research; South Africa, which scrapped 
its half a dozen operational warheads when the apartheid regime 
collapsed; the nuclear successor states of the Soviet Union, 
which agreed that only Russia should have nuclear weapons. 
  The attempt to make North Korea give up its nuclear program 
in exchange for special material benefits has failed. The 
attempt to exert pressure on the regime by imposing sanctions 
will also fail. As long as Kim Il-song's regime considers its 
own bomb more important than the whole Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty, the international community will confront the nuclear 
shark like a paper tiger in its attempt to push through the 
contractual obligations. Antiproliferation policy should rather 
concentrate on the following three aspects: 

  -  Good old 
deterrence: It must be made clear to North Korea that the bomb 
will not give it any military edge over the South. This requires 
more support for the defense of South Korea; 
  -  Damage limitation: 
Pyongyang must be prevented from exporting nuclear material and 
nuclear carrier weapons. This requires a blockade of North 
Korean exports, possibly already in the near future; 
  -  The 
readiness of the other countries in the region to discuss, and 
thereby possibly reduce, Pyongyang's security policy concerns. 
That is why the Russian proposal to call an international 
conference with the participation of North Korea deserves to be 
approved. 

  An appeasement program? Not at all. A guarantee of success? 
By no means. However, it is the consequence of the realistic 
realization that nuclear armament can at best be controlled 
indirectly, and that this is the only way to de-escalate a 
conflict, which may lead to war.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Robert Leicht: "Difficult Visit"] </F>
  [Text] The world is commemorating the victims of the war 
against Nazism and fascism, while Italy's first neofascist 
postwar government appears on the diplomatic stage. The U.S. 
President was the first foreign visitor, and Bonn will be the 
first destination -- Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has 
entered the foreign-political scene. 
  Bill Clinton praised Berlusconi's cabinet last week for its 
"diligence," as a French newspaper wrote. He said he was deeply 
impressed by the new government's democratic commitment; 
however, the people had to be judged by their deeds. What 
attitude will or should Chancellor Helmut Kohl show when 
Berlusconi comes to Bonn next week -- shortly after the member 
states of the European Union [EU], which was founded against the 
furies of the past, have elected their new parliament? Should 
he drown any reservations by giving him confidence in advance, 
or should he show a certain critical distance? 
  Bonn does not seem to be happy about the privilege of the 
first visit from Rome. The Germans with their dual past are 
certainly in a doubly difficult situation regarding their former 
partner of the Axis in accursed times. They should not come 
under suspicion of fraternizing with the fascists, nor should 
they try to play a patronizing role, for which they are not 
qualified anyway. Other Europeans have already raised their 
voices. President Francois Mitterrand said warningly: 
"Careful, danger!" EU Commission President Jacques Delors 
called for "concerned vigilance." The European Parliament 
reminded the Italian president of the basic values, which "after 
the atrocities of fascism and Nazism marked the founding of the 
European Community." 
  We have indeed every reason to be vigilant if a neofascist 
European candidate in Italy talks about "concentration camps" to 
be set up for homosexuals; if the chairman of the parliamentary 
foreign affairs committee says that border treaties with 
neighbors should be revised; if Gianfranco Fini, the chairman of 
the extreme right-wing Alleanza Nazionale, one of the three 
coalition parties, calls the dictator Mussolini the greatest 
statesman of all times, at least of this century. 
  Should we look away, or should we interfere? The EU is more 
than a loose club of sovereign states -- it sees itself as a 
community sharing equal values and has bound itself to respect 
certain human and basic rights. Whenever this human peace code 
is undermined, interference is necessary. The new democracies 
in East Europe come from dictatorships, are seeking to join the 
European Community, and -- with or without postcommunists -- may 
not have reached the goal in every respect, but the tendency is 
right. Italy is one of the founding members of the European 
Community, but if postfascists and ultrarightists assume power, 
the tendency is not right anymore; there are five [fascist] 
ministers in Rome and watchdogs in all the other ministries. 
  Bonn should also take Rome at its word now -- regarding its 
democratic oath and its dangerous talk. The contradiction 
between both worlds must be cleared once and for all. Trying to 
win voters by means of extremist slogans at home, and making 
solemn democratic statements during visits to European capitals 
-- the Italian Government cannot expect its European partners to 
accept such a double game. 
  However, in this policy of delimitation, the Europeans must 
do a real precision job. After all, they do not dissociate 
themselves from the Italians, but from the neofascists and their 
political activities. Only 1 percent of the Italians have 
publicly adopted the heritage of Mussolini; however, 13.5 
percent of them voted for the extreme right-wing camp. But 
compared with these figures, neither the French nor the Germans 
have any reason to look down their noses. 
  If history were an efficient teacher, there should be no 
ultrarightists anywhere in Europe. But meanwhile, all Europeans 
must clearly define the necessary democratic lines, above all, 
at their own front door. Berlusconi assumed great 
responsibility when he blurred these lines in the interests of 
power. Helmut Kohl must remind him of his responsibility.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Munich SUEDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG writes on the outcome of 
the European Parliament elections: The election expresses three 
things. First, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] is 
experiencing an uplift; on the other hand, chancellor candidate 
[Rudolf] Scharping's Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is 
in heavy turbulence. Second, the adventurous victory procession 
of the Republikaner is over. Third, the Greens are taking over 
the role of the Free Democratic Party [FDP] as the third 
strongest party of the Republic. The CDU is quite obviously 
benefiting from the improved economic situation and from Helmut 
Kohl's authority in European politics. The Greens are winning 
thanks to a clear opposition policy. The SPD is hardly likely 
to gain any consolation from the communal elections for the 
disaster of the European Parliament elections, says SUEDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG. 
  The SAECHSISCHE ZEITUNG of Dresden says: Nothing has been 
decided yet in the German superelection year. In the 126 days 
left until the Bundestag election, literally everything is 
possible. That is the main message of the European Parliament 
election, despite the clear victory of the CDU/CSU and the 
equally clear defeat of the SPD. If people had voted in October 
the way they did yesterday, the CDU/CSU would not have been able 
to govern in the way it does now. Its partner, the FDP, would 
not have attained the 5-percent threshold. In such a case, it 
could only have governed together with the Alliance 90/Greens, 
which is absolutely improbable, or entered into a grand 
coalition with the Social Democrats under a new Helmut Kohl 
chancellorship. But, in that case, an alliance of the SPD with 
the Alliance 90/Greens would have been more probable, claims the 
SAECHSISCHE ZEITUNG. 
  The LEIPZIGER VOLKSZEITUNG views things thus: The heirs of 
the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] are clearly profiting 
from the economic problems; they are finding support above all 
among those who have lost out on the change, especially the 
unemployed. In addition, they have succeeded in representing 
themselves as a kind of red CSU, the only eastern party to do 
so. Many in the west will fail to understand this, but they 
will have to live with this eastern German viewpoint and this 
party, though it remains to be seen whether it will enter the 
Bundestag. 
  DIE WELT of Berlin says: Chancellor Kohl is experiencing a 
driving force for the decisive battle for the Bundestag in the 
autumn. Obviously his CDU has succeeded in overcoming the 
depression of the beginning of the year and stopping the 
advancement of the parties situated to its right. Right now, 
the rickety coalition partner FDP seems to be the only risk to 
his government's future. Challenger Scharping's bid for power 
is already pausing before it is ready to take a swing. His SPD 
had to witness the disastrous march of the SED's heir PDS 
[Democratic Socialist Party] in the east and the rise of the 
Greens in the west, which are on its left, says DIE WELT. 
  The BRAUNSCHWEIGER ZEITUNG comments as follows: While the 
SPD possesses a willing coalition partner in the surprisingly 
strengthened Greens, whose admission to the Bundestag now seems 
sure, the FDP's stroke of bad luck is continuing. In the end, 
although Helmut Kohl could end up an election winner in October, 
he might not have a coalition partner, and would thus end up the 
loser after all. This imminent insecurity is probably clouding 
the chancellor's pleasure not only with his party's performance, 
but also with Austria's good election turnout and surprisingly 
unanimous yes to membership of the European Union, the 
BRAUNSCHWEIGER ZEITUNG believes. 
  The NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG reaches the following 
conclusion: The strong gains of the PDS, and this must be said 
with all due clarity, are no glorious chapter for the new 
laender. Even if they mainly represent a protest, 
understandable from the point of view of the labor market, it 
will not be so easy to quickly forget the causes of the economic 
misery. After all, it was the PDS' political forebears, the 
autocrats inside the SED, who ruined the former GDR ecologically 
and economically. To see them as emergency rescuers again is 
asking for trouble, the OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG concludes. 
  The KOELNER STADTANZEIGER says that Helmut Kohl is now ahead 
of Rudolf Scharping as the favorite in the race for the 
Chancellery. The Free Democrats have once again been catapulted 
out of the Strasbourg parliament. That is painful for the 
foreign minister's party. Even so, in the second-vote election 
campaign, the liberals can still hope to cross the 5-percent 
threshold in the Bundestag election. After yesterday's vote, 
the chances of a continuation of the Bonn coalition have even 
improved markedly, says the KOELNER STADTANZEIGER. 
  Now a quotation from the KOBLENZER RHEIN-ZEITUNG: The upturn 
for Kohl and his peers, which could be observed parallel to the 
improved economic situation, is obviously continuing. On the 
other hand, the extent of the defeat is a disaster for the SPD 
and, above all, for its chancellor candidate Scharping. This is 
no longer a question of a slight loss of form that was talked 
about following Rau's defeat. Now Scharping's entire election 
strategy is probably at issue, states the RHEIN-ZEITUNG. 
  The RHEIN-PFALZ, which appears in Ludwigshafen, notes: The 
SPD, lately beset with sudden attacks of weakness, and 
chancellor candidate Rudolf Scharping, who has acted clumsily 
once or twice, have made victory easy for the CDU. In addition, 
Scharping made a strategic error by dealing with almost nothing 
but labor and employment policy topics in his election campaign. 
He failed to show how he would handle foreign and security 
policy in Europe, the RHEIN-PFALZ says.

  [Text] Prime Minister Balladur supported the Baudis [Rally 
for the Republic/French Democratic Union] list. He spoke about 
the results this morning during his visit to Lille. The prime 
minister: 
  [Begin Balladur recording] These elections in fact show a 
degree of dispersion in the representation of France in the 
European Parliament. At the same time, they show that the very 
great majority of French people are attached to Europe but 
dissatisfied at the way in which things work. [end recording] 
  Mr. Balladur added that the votes for Mr. Philippe de 
Villiers belong to the majority and should be counted with those 
of the majority. He also announced this morning in a speech 
that he is at the moment preparing a new action plan for his 
government for the next six months.

  [Excerpts] A calculator is the most useful tool this 
evening to draw the consequences of yesterday's European 
elections. [passage omitted] 
  Edouard Balladur may have been waiting for the release of 
these final results before reacting. This morning, the prime 
minister regretted the break-up of the French delegation in 
Strasbourg. He was keen to add the 12 percent achieved by 
Philippe de Villiers's list to the 25 percent gained by the 
Baudis list in assessing the weight of the majority. 
  On a visit to Lille, Edouard Balladur launched his strategy 
for the coming months, during a year which--although he has 
denied it-- will focus on the presidential elections. Jerome 
Cathala and Yves Barbe report: 
  [Cathala] Whether we have European elections or not, Edouard 
Balladur is intent on pursuing his policies. In Lille this 
morning, he explained that the performance of the Baudis list 
was not a failure. For him, this result shows, on the contrary, 
that the strategy of uniting the majority is more indispensable 
than ever. For Edouard Balladur, this is a way of putting the 
European elections behind him and of thinking about what comes 
next: 
  [Begin Balladur recording] The goal of the government over 
the next six months will be, first and foremost, to continue the 
recovery and to accelerate it up if need be, despite the 
difficulties of the moment. Second, we will call for the 
largest possible union, and I am convinced that this is what the 
French are waiting for. They are not going to spend the next 
year under the stress of opinion polls and the next presidential 
elections. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Yesterday evening, Philippe de 
Villiers and Bernard Tapie immediately informed their respective 
camps that from now on, they would be counting on them. Bernard 
Tapie, for example, claims to have the most European outlook in 
the campaign: 
  [Begin Tapie recording] We are very happy here, really. But 
I would like to say simply that people must stop saying that we 
do not have a program. I think we did well because we had 
courage. We had the courage to try to put forward ideas that 
are not very popular today and that are not winners -- that is 
to say, the idea of a federal Europe is not something that 
excites people. The idea that the problem of immigration is not 
one to be tackled by repression is not a very popular thing 
either. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Francois Lenglet article including interview with European </F>
Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure; place and date not given: 
"The End of Europe a la Francaise"--first paragraph is 
L'EXPANSION introduction] 
  [Text] With monetary union on the back burner, the failure 
of a common foreign policy, and Jacques Delors' upcoming 
departure, the influence of French ideas is flagging in Europe. 
  His face surly and drawn, a senior French official looks 
back 
over his years with Jacques Delors in Brussels: in the 
beginning, the exaltation of the small community of Eurocrats 
that had managed to mesmerize an entire continent with the "1993 
objective"; the apotheosis of Maastricht; the brutal depression 
that followed Denmark's rejection; and now, an uncustomary, 
disorienting calm--nothingness. "It is the end of an era," he 
says to conclude his retrospective, "and perhaps the end of a 
dream." The upcoming departure of Jacques Delors--the 12 heads 
of state will designate his successor in June--sounds the death 
knell for a certain kind of Europe, the one envisaged by Jean 
Monnet and the other French pioneers around him who sought to 
meld the nations of the free world into a sovereign, federal 
whole. 
  These pioneers had a proclaimed motive, preventing the 
outbreak of a third world war on the continent, and a more 
subtle but equally essential one: providing France with a sphere 
of political influence that would make it the interlocutor of 
the two rival superpowers of the era. Those two objectives could 
be attained only with a high degree of economic and political 
integration. Today, however, everything conspires to push the 
European Union towards a looser, more uncertain form of 
association in which France will count for what it really is, a 
"small-to-medium-sized power" henceforth unable to influence the 
course of the continent now taking shape, the Europe of nations. 
  From the economic standpoint, Jacques Delors' departure 
coincides with the total victory of market-based policies over 
economic and monetary integration. "Europe today is shaped more 
by competition law and administrative regulations than by the 
political will of the member states," says Elie Cohen, research 
director at CNRS [National Center for Scientific Research] and 
an informed observer of European integration. What is working 
are industrial standards, the free circulation of goods and 
capital, and the control of business mergers. What is not 
working is concerted action to jump-start the European economy 
and decrease unemployment, as illustrated by the pitiful 
"European growth initiative," for which only a few billion ECU's 
[European currency units] were released. Another failure is 
industrial policy, once the core of "French-style Europe," the 
stillborn, prematurely obsolescent D2 MAC standard for high 
definition television being only the latest in a long series of 
defeats. If there were any vague desires subsisting in this 
area, the Maastricht Treaty put paid to them: industrial policy 
may in no case justify "any measure which may cause distortions 
in competition," according to Article XIII. One could not be 
clearer. Market mechanisms and market players must be allowed to 
operate. 
  As for monetary union, which was supposed to result in a 
sharing of power, one need only observe the cautious Bank of 
France to see that its vaunted independence is a myth. It does 
no more than translate the decisions of the Bundesbank into 
French and is incapable of setting French real interest rates at 
the German level (approximately 4 points in Paris compared to 2 
in Frankfurt). Not only is integration going nowhere, but the 
French authorities' room to maneuver has also shrunk since the 
laborious ratification of Maastricht, as France now has the dual 
handicap of high interest rates and a weak currency. 
  Of all the common policies, creating the single market was 
actually the "easiest" and the most natural. First, it is the 
only existing basis for agreement among the Twelve; beyond the 
market, the various conceptions of Europe differ increasingly 
and even clash, as do conceptions of economic and monetary 
policy. Second, eliminating borders was in step with the times. 
The Single Act never did any more than ride the wave of 
deregulation and trade liberalization that swept the 1980's. 
National sovereignty, which the member states feared would be 
encroached upon by Brussels, had in any case already been 
reduced by the internationalization of capital and goods flows. 
In the end, the single market has more of the marks of U.S.- and 
English-inspired liberalism than European federalism. 
  What is more serious for France is that Jacques Delors' 
great 
legacy has not in the least resolved the initial ambiguity of 
European unification. The French see the single market as the 
beginning of a process that will lead to a European currency, 
while the British and the Danes continue to consider it an end 
in itself. We are all still clinging to our positions. What 
about the Germans, who hold the real power? Skeptics will say 
that, at the least, Germany has used this ambiguity to compel 
its partners to peg their currencies to the mark so that it can 
maintain its own competitiveness in Europe, the market for most 
of its exports, and that it has done this without sharing any of 
its power to set interest rates, dazzling its neighbors with the 
glitter of the single currency each time they balked at the 
effort. 
  From the political standpoint, the very purpose of the 
project was radically altered by the fall of communism. 
Sheltered behind the comfortable Iron Curtain, yesterday's 
Community could unworriedly contemplate strengthening economic 
and political ties among its existing members while carefully 
controlling the influx of new ones. Today's Union, which no 
longer has a wall to lean on, needs to think first about 
expanding so that the many countries that have emerged from the 
former East bloc can coexist peacefully. While the goal of the 
Europe envisaged by its founding fathers was the sharing of 
power and the abolition of nations, today's Europe has a very 
different objective: to bring nations into an organized 
structure that will replace the old order. 
  Today's nations, especially the youngest ones, the ones to 
our east, are afraid--afraid of their unpredictable, 
mob-infested former master, Russia. The motivation of these 
latest applicants to the EU is essentially political. In April, 
Hungry applied for membership in order to solve its security 
problem, as did Poland: Budapest and Warsaw are knocking at the 
Union's door, not to lose themselves in the whole, but to 
preserve their existence. The former neutral countries (Austria, 
Sweden, and Finland) also warmed to the Union for political 
reasons, because neutrality no longer guarantees their security 
on a "monopolar" continent with no easily identifiable enemy. 
  France has lost much in its reluctant acceptance of this new 
Europe. If sharing of power does not occur--and it will become 
more and more difficult as the Union expands--each member 
country will find itself with the economic and political weight 
that history has given it. "This will not be a very good deal 
for France, whose political influence was artificially prolonged 
by the division of Europe," a source close to Delors says. 
  Still, there is no point in trying to halt the expansion, 
because doing so would drive a solid wedge between France and 
Germany, which is under constant political, economic, and 
immigration pressure from the east. These pressures have led 
Chancellor Kohl, who once favored greater integration over 
expansion, to issue numerous invitations to his eastern 
neighbors. "Opening up the European institutions is vital to 
Germany's interests," he said in February in Munich. "German 
unity and European unity are two sides of the same coin." In 
other words, Germany prefers a larger, stable Europe to a 
federal Europe with chaos at its eastern door, because this door 
just happens to be the German border. 
  These changes will be all the more painful for France since 
they will go hand in hand with a loss of control over European 
institutions. There is, of course, the end of the president's 
term of office (see box, p 98). But there are also the simple 
consequences of the admission of Sweden, Austria, Finland, and 
Norway approved in March. As of 1 January, the Union will be 
headed by an executive body of 21 commissioners (for 16 
countries) within which France's relative influence will be 
diminished. The same is true of the Council of Ministers, which 
will have proportionally fewer French ministers. It will no 
longer be possible to "create a majority" by agreeing with the 
Germans on the essential points in order to carry the undecided. 
As a consequence, it will be harder to achieved a victory like 
the one Paris obtained last 20 September when it rallied its 11 
partners to its position on the Uruguay Round. 
  French influence could be further diluted by the growing 
congestion of the European institutional and legal landscape. 
Alain Lamassoure, minister for European affairs, counts no fewer 
than 19 ways of enacting a European law: by unanimous vote of 
the Council, by the approval of a qualified majority, by vote 
with approval by Parliament, by joint decision.... The list of 
inventions owed to the fertile imagination of European jurists 
is long, especially since the Maastricht Treaty. Such a 
cumbersome system, in which it is no longer clear who makes the 
decisions or how they are taken, is becoming very difficult to 
understand--or to explain to voters. 
  Furthermore, additional politico-administrative bodies will 
be created to carry out the Union's new tasks under Maastricht. 
Because the heads of state refused to increase the Commission's 
powers, the 16 member states will handle some of these 
duties--those that come under foreign policy, for example--at 
the intergovernmental level. To that end, they will need at 
least a common secretariat with several dozen employees. A 
committee of permanent representatives of the foreign ministers 
will be instituted at the Corfu summit in June. This committee 
will join the ranks of the longstanding Committee of Permanent 
Representatives (COREPER) of the member states, the Schengen 
Committee (an intergovernmental structure for the common 
administration of borders), the Committee of Regions created by 
Maastricht, and all the other pre-existing committees. "The web 
is getting harder and harder to untangle," says Yves-Thibault de 
Silguy, Edouard Balladur's advisor for European affairs. Where 
the process of European integration was once guided by a small 
executive body with the support of a homogenous administrative 
apparatus, it will now be spread among a plethoric Commission 
and obscure intergovernmental structures whose shape varies with 
the subject. With this as the engine, how can the project be got 
to move forward? 
  To preserve the chances of an integrated Europe, 
institutional reform will be necessary. It was not attempted 
before Austria and the three Scandinavian countries joined, 
Elisabeth Guigou reminds us, because Maastricht had not yet been 
adopted and it would have reduced the chances for ratification. 
Instead, the treaty itself calls for the holding of an 
intergovernmental conference on the subject in 1996 to prepare 
the institutions for future membership increases. 
  The topics the conference will have to tackle are clear. 
First, there is the question of how to create a more "compact" 
executive body by reducing the number of commissioners in order 
to facilitate its decisions and break their ambiguous ties with 
their countries of origin (the current rule giving each country 
at least one commissioner will be abolished). In compensation, 
it will be necessary to strengthen the Parliament's role by 
changing the voting system for European elections. Electing 
Eurodeputies by district (as only the British do today) would 
probably be more to the point of European integration, since 
candidates would have to fight for their seats, which is 
currently the case neither for those at the head of the list, 
who are guaranteed election, or those at the bottom, who are 
guaranteed defeat. 
  In order not to weaken the process of monetary integration, 
it will be necessary to create a sort of "antechamber" to hold 
off East European applicants a while longer. While this idea has 
been advanced frequently, in the past it has been a matter of 
increasing trade between the Union and countries to the east 
through "association agreements" or through the European 
Economic Area, which would enable its members to export freely 
within the Community. However, the eastern applicants' priority 
need is for a political antechamber, since their major concern 
is security. They want a defense treaty that will protect them 
from aggression. Is Europe ready for this? 
  These institutional and political reforms will mean 
tremendous work, and work in which France can still play an 
important role, since it will have the good fortune of presiding 
over the Union at the very time the preparations for the 
intergovernmental conference are to begin, in the first half of 
1995. However, to bring off this role and defend its vision of 
Europe, it will have to resist two temptations. The first is to 
turn a deaf ear to the requests of the East Europeans and to 
refuse to allow the Union to prepare to accommodate them 
rapidly. If the Russian threat were then to grow, the impromptu 
incorporation of the countries of Eastern Europe would place a 
tremendous strain on the Union's budget, because they would have 
to be provided with assistance. The cost would be so high (an 
estimated 330 billion francs a year) that it could lastingly 
destabilize the Twelve--or the Sixteen. 
  The second temptation is for France to do as it has 
sometimes 
done and adopt the Gaullist attitude of wanting both a powerful 
Europe and powerless institutions. A German negotiator remembers 
having seen France and Great Britain make common cause in order 
to limit the Commission's prerogatives during the drafting of 
the Maastricht treaty. Can we complain about the slow pace of 
integration and at the same time refuse to transfer the 
sovereignty that it supposes? Probably not. To breathe new life 
into France's vision of Europe, France will have to become more 
European. 
<H5>  [Box, pp 94-95] </H5>
<H5>  Our Influence Will Be Exerted Differently </H5>
  [L'EXPANSION] Isn't France's influence over a larger Europe 
condemned to decline, especially once Jacques Delors leaves 
Brussels? 
  [Lamassoure] Of course it will never again be what was in 
the 
days of the founding fathers, when France exercised de facto 
leadership because it was dealing with a divided Germany, a weak 
Italy, and the three little Benelux countries. Our influence 
will be exerted differently now. We will have to build 
majorities around our positions, exactly as we did in the case 
of GATT. As for Jacques Delors, the French vision of Europe 
predated him, and it will survive him. We should not 
overestimate the role of the Commission's president, even if 
Jacques Delors made a profound impact on it as the architect of 
the single market. 
  [L'EXPANSION] Isn't there a danger that expanding to include 
the countries of East Europe may slow economic and political 
integration, which is the heart of this "French vision" of 
Europe? 
  [Lamassoure] I do not think so, provided we manage to build 
a 
Europe made up of concentric circles that will allow the 
strongest economies to get on with integration while at the same 
time offering the other countries credible prospects. This is 
necessary, anyway, because we have entered a new century. The 
objective is no longer to construct an ideal, federal Europe 
around the Franco-German axis, but to achieve a "twice Twelve" 
Europe that will ensure our prosperity and the security of our 
eastern neighbors. 
  [L'EXPANSION] This cannot be done without changing the 
institutions. 
  [Lamassoure] Yes, there are at least two preconditions for 
successful expansion. The first is to manage to settle minority 
and border-related issues of these young democracies at the 
Paris Conference at the end of April 1994. The second is to lay 
the groundwork for the 1996 institutional reforms stipulated in 
the Maastricht Treaty so that we can clarify the respective 
roles of the Council of Ministers and the Commission and make 
them more democratically accountable by strengthening the power 
of the European Parliament and the national legislatures. 
<H5>  [Box, p 98] </H5>
<H5>  The Presidency Changes Hands </H5>
  Jacques Delors' successor at the helm of the Commission will 
be chosen during the European summit in Corfu early this June. 
There are three men in the running: the only declared candidate, 
Leon Brittan, who does not stand a chance because he is British; 
the favorite, the Netherlands' former prime minister, Ruud 
Lubbers, who does not want to declare his candidacy for fear of 
being rebuffed; and an outsider, Belgian Prime Minister Luc 
Dehaene, who would have a good chance if his departure for the 
Commission did not endanger the fragile political-linguistic 
equilibrium of the Belgian government. 
  Once designated, the president will, with the member states, 
put together the Commission that will take over on 1 January. 
Each country will then appoint its commissioner or commissioners 
and will negotiate their assignments. France, which has two 
posts, is aiming for the competition portfolio, but without much 
hope, given that no one is prepared to abandon it since the 
incumbent, Karel Van Miert, has done nothing untoward. It may 
make do with another big "ministry," external affairs (currently 
headed by Leon Brittan), and industry, which is less valuable 
because there is no real power attached to it. 
  However, from now on it will be necessary to compromise more 
with the other countries because, with the loss of President 
Delors and his cabinet, France will be losing the power of 
initiative and its control over the Commission's agenda. True, 
Jacques Delors has always maintained scrupulous neutrality on 
votes concerning matters of particular interest to France, such 
as Aerospatiale's takeover of De Havilland. The president is 
bound by impartiality during the consideration of the problems 
of "the country he knows best," to quote the phrase used in the 
Commission. However, repeated salvaging of the Common 
Agricultural Policy's and the Twelve's support for the French 
position on GATT were not unrelated to the nationality of the 
president and the patient, determined work of his collaborators. 
There is reason to fear that a Ruud Lubbers may not be as 
understanding of France's vital interests.

<F P=106> [Report by Veronique Soule: "Anti-Karadzic Serbs Speak Out"] </F>
  [Text] The one-month cease-fire agreed on 8 June in Geneva, 
which entered into force at noon on Friday [10 June], has met 
with unequal compliance. "We have encouraging reports from 
certain regions, while in other areas the fronts have remained 
active," a UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] spokesman stated. 
  "The German press describes us as `reasonable Serbs' and I 
am 
very pleased to hear it." Mirko Pejanovic is certainly a 
courageous man: A Bosnian Serb but "a Bosnian above all," he 
heads the Council of Serb Citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a body 
set up on 27 April in Sarajevo that opposes the partitioning of 
the republic and wants to maintain a multiethnic Bosnia. 
Denouncing the fact that the international community treats 
Radovan Karadzic as the sole representative of the Bosnian 
Serbs, he is on a three-day visit to Paris, after visiting a 
number of European capitals, including Moscow. 
  "In the history of Bosnia, no war has succeeded in 
destroying 
tolerance and the ability to live together." A political 
science professor at Sarajevo University and a member of the 
Bosnian collegial presidency since June 1991, Mirko Pejanovic 
claims to represent the 200,000 Serbs residing in areas 
controlled by the Bosnian Army, the majority of them Muslims. 
"You must also take into account the 400,000 Bosnian Serb 
refugees who want to return," he pointed out. "In total, we 
represent nearly as many Serbs as those living in Karadzic's 
republic, who number almost 600,000, many of them wanting peace." 
  The Council of Serb Citizens supports the Croato-Bosnian 
federation which is currently being organized, although it had 
asked for the Constitution to include a clause stating that in 
addition to the Croats and Muslims, the Serbs, who constitute a 
national minority, were also one of the federation's founders. A 
decision on this question has been postponed until later, to be 
settled in the framework of a global settlement. "We do not 
want to become second-class citizens within the federation," 
stated Pejanovic, "First of all there was Karadzic's war and 
the secession; then in Sarajevo, we felt growing hostility 
toward us. We refuse to become Palestinians within our own 
country." 
  "Only Russia and France can exert pressure on the Serbs to 
accept a political solution," he stresses. In Moscow, Pejanovic 
claims to have "obtained the assurance that Russia is opposed to 
the partitioning of Bosnia and against ethnic cleansing." 
Pejanovic believes that any solution must include a federation 
organized into cantons. In order to permit the return of 1 
million refugees, there is also a need to set up "international 
miniprotectorates in the gray (or contested) zones." These 
areas are now controlled by Serb forces but had Croat and Muslim 
majorities before the war. 
  Invited to the French National Assembly by the 
France-Bosnia-Herzegovina friendship group, Pejanovic, who is 
also to have talks at the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry], paid 
homage to the initiators of the "Europe Begins at Sarajevo" 
list: "Europe has slumbered throughout this war. This party is 
an awakening of conscience. For the first time, moral 
principles have been raised rather than concentrating primarily 
on political imperatives." 
  Pejanovic shows little concern at being described as a 
"traitor" by Karadzic and his henchmen: "If you are a traitor 
because you reject ethnic cleansing, then I am happy to be 
described as one."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with 'Abd al-'Aziz 'Abd-al Ghani, </F>
member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, by Mouna Naim; place 
and date not given: "Yemen: 'Abd-al Ghani Condemns 
`Interference' by Saudi Arabia, other Gulf Countries"] 
  [Text] 'Abd-al 'Aziz 'Abd-al Ghani is convinced that if 
there had been no foreign interference, war would not have 
broken out between northerners and southerners, who could thus 
have settled their differences through dialogue. On a stopover 
in Paris, the Yemeni vice president [as published], who is a 
northerner though he rejects the definition in the name of the 
country's unity, was received by Jean Vidal, diplomatic adviser 
to Mr. Mitterrand, on Thursday, 8 June. He was also due to meet 
with Denis Bauchard, the Foreign Ministry's North Africa and 
Middle East desk chief. 
  By "foreign interference," Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani meant the 
support granted to the leaders of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
(YSP), which governs in Aden, by the Gulf countries, and more 
specifically Saudi Arabia. He said that the oil monarchies "do 
not want to see the emergence in this region of a strong, 
densely populated (14 million inhabitants -- LE MONDE editor's 
note) state that possesses oil and that is moreover a democratic 
republic." 
  Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani omitted to say that the conflict between 
the YSP and the General People's Congress (GPC) of the 
(northern) president, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, over power sharing 
and a constitutional framework for the state has been growing 
worse for almost a year and that YSP cadres and assets have been 
the target of a number of attacks, without this overly upsetting 
the central government, however. And though he admitted that 
there were some problems, he only acknowledged that 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, leader of the south before the proclamation of unity in 
1990, has never agreed to become second-in-command in the 
unified state. 
  Mr. 'Abd al-Ghani said that he would not have leveled 
charges 
at the oil monarchies, but for the following facts: "Articles 
in the Kuwaiti press stating that the emirate would be willing 
to spend its last cent to achieve the partitioning of Yemen, and 
a visit to Riyadh in February by former Vice President al-Bid, 
amid great publicity and with full honors." The same, he said, 
applies to a statement by the Kuwaiti foreign minister, citing 
the possibility of working for the "recognition" of the 
"Democratic Republic of Yemen" proclaimed by Aden and its 
"recent implicit recognition by the countries of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council." Not to mention the fact that weapons 
"have continued to arrive at Mukalla" in the south in recent 
months. "So who funded these purchases?" Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani 
asked. 
  For all these reasons the Sanaa government is convinced that 
it was on the instigation of "foreign parties" that the YSP 
leaders initiated hostilities, with the aim of proclaiming a 
secession. As for the southerners, they blame the northerners 
for the outbreak of war, secession being only the unavoidable 
result. 
<H5>  `Weakening the Country' </H5>
  Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani is convinced that Saudi Arabia and the 
other oil monarchies are acting "not out of love for the Yemenis 
of the south or for Mr. al-Bid, but in order to weaken the 
country." While admitting that Riyadh also finances the 
powerful Hashid tribe, loyal to the central government, he 
believes that this is also in order to split the Yemenis and to 
keep several irons in the fire. "Our brothers in the Gulf also 
want to punish us for our stance" in support of Iraq during the 
Gulf war. "Despite everything, we want to maintain good 
relations with them," he said. 
  Though fighting continues, despite successive cease-fires, 
Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani reaffirmed the Sanaa government's 
determination to "safeguard unity" by peaceful means but also, 
if necessary, by war. As for a possible dialogue with the 
"secessionists," this remains dependent, he said, on the 
relinquishment of separation and the exclusion of those who 
proclaimed it, and especially of Mr. al-Bid.

  [Editorial Report] As early as Tuesday [17 May] morning, 
[Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua insisted on making it known 
that he was not "aware" of the arrival in Paris of Libyan 
Foreign Minister `Umar al-Muntasir. This visit, revealed by 
Europe 1 television, provoked the protests of the families of 
the victims in the explosion of the UTA aircraft. 
  The interior minister's statement is all the more surprising 
given that the Libyan eminence did not spend his Parisian 
weekend in a suspect little hotel, but at the Crillon Hotel on 
Place de la Concorde, some hundreds of meters away from his 
ministry. A Parisian palace where this type of visit rarely goes 
undetected by the Directorate of Territorial Security (DST) 
counterespionage agents. 
  It is the French Embassy in Tripoli that granted a visa to 
the Libyan minister who wished to transit Paris, on his way to 
South Africa and back. The granting of the visa was the object 
of a telegram addressed by the French ambassador to the Foreign 
Ministry, which sent a copy to the Interior Ministry and to the 
air and border police, as stipulated in administrative 
procedures. 
  Therefore, there are just two hypotheses left: either 
Charles 
Pasqua is fooling us, or he does not read the reports of his own 
services. Both hypothese are not very reassuring with regard to 
someone who once upon a time was most concerned about 
"terrorizing the terrorists."

  [Text] Twenty people were arrested in France this morning 
in another police operation against Basque Fatherland and 
Liberty [ETA]. David Morales, our correspondent in Paris, has 
the latest: 
  [Morales] The latest information on the police swoop in the 
French Basque country and Brittany reveals that among the 20 or 
so arrested for their alleged links with ETA -- the majority of 
them French citizens -- there are at least five Spaniards. 
Police sources contacted by RNE say that the operation is still 
going on but they have refused to reveal the identities of those 
arrested. They could be connected with the terrorist 
organization's support infrastructure in France. The arrests 
seem to be a result of investigations carried out by the Paris 
investigating magistrate, Laurence Levert, on ETA but other 
sources also believe that there is a link between the 
extradition to Spain on 2 June under the emergency procedure, 
that is without the customary hearing, of ETA member Jose 
Domingo Aizpurua Aizpuru, alias Pitxas, just as he was leaving 
Fleury prison on the outskirts of Paris where he had just served 
a sentence for criminal association.

<F P=106> [Report by Dominique Seux: "Sarkozy: Tax Surpluses Will Be </F>
Limited"] 
  [Text] Tax receipts do not indicate that progress in 
business activities is coming faster than predicted, especially 
in terms of consumption. Tax surpluses will be limited to 10 
billion French francs [Fr]. However, yesterday [Budget 
Minister] Nicolas Sarkozy pointed out that predictions for 
French growth may be increased at the end of the month to 1.6 or 
1.7 percent. 
  The government is making every effort to convince the public 
to take its budgetary policy seriously. In the face of mounting 
tension in recent weeks on the bond market, not to mention the 
criticisms of certain high-ranking officials at the Bank of 
France, it has tirelessly reiterated that it will respect its 
commitments regarding the budget deficit. Yesterday, Nicolas 
Sarkozy hammered out this message once again, presenting the 
main figures for the semiannual budget to the finance committees 
of the National Assembly and the Senate. He pointed out: "The 
objective for 1994, Fr301.4 billion, will be stringently 
respected. Nobody should doubt this." He also emphasized that 
"any drift in the deficit would affect the development of 
interest rates," and "would jeopardize the recovery and the 
return to stronger growth." 
  The budget minister reaffirmed this principle all the more 
strongly because he believes he can only count on minimal extra 
receipts to finance the new expenditure announced during the 
first quarter. Since growth is driven mainly by exports and the 
resumption of company investment, he explained: "It is 
difficult to hope for more than Fr10 billion in extra tax 
receipts," compared with this year's forecasts (Fr1,236.6 
billion for tax receipts). He added: "Only a much stronger 
recovery in household consumption, which has yet to come about, 
would result in surplus tax receipts, notably in terms of VAT 
[value-added tax]." Detailing the figures submitted to 
parliament last week, the budget minister pointed out that, at 
the end of April, "effectively recovered" tax receipts exceeded 
forecasts by Fr3 billion. A welcome surprise came in the form 
of Fr4.7 billion on corporate tax, but this was offset by 
capital losses of Fr1 billion on VAT and of Fr600 million on the 
domestic tax on oil by-products. 
<H5>  Supporting Consumption </H5>
  Although tax receipts on income match the forecast figure, 
VAT returns clearly show that there has been no real 
acceleration in consumption. Hence a degree of caution when it 
comes to predicting growth. Mr. Sarkozy said: "A decision on 
the possibility of revising the predicted growth of the French 
economy at 1.6 to 1.7 percent will not be made before the 
meeting of the National Audit Committee in late June or early 
July." In reality, the government is counting on the impact of 
two measures already adopted in order to stimulate consumption 
during the next parliamentary session: the already announced 
tripling of the back-to-school benefit, and the effect on income 
tax of the 1994 budget reform. In all, he believes that Fr20 
billion will be available for households. This is a slightly 
optimistic calculation insofar as these two measures are 
incomparable, one being a case of aid in the form of liquid 
assets, the other being a case of levying less. 
  There is also a pedagogical aim in exercising caution 
regarding tax receipts, namely avoiding getting into a future 
spiral of new forms of expenditure. According to Nicolas 
Sarkozy, such expenditure already amounts to Fr18 billion, and 
doubtless more than Fr20 billion if we add the Fr10 billion 
pledged by Air France (only one portion of which has been paid), 
funding provided by the "transfer of the AGF [Assurances 
Generales de France] at the end of the year." In particular, 
there is the carryover of unspent credits from 1993, including 
those earmarked for defense (worth Fr5.5 billion), the bonus for 
employing of young people (Fr2.5 billion), measures accompanying 
the devaluation of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc, 
and the allocation of the back-to-school benefit (Fr6 billion). 
  The cost of the "wrecking bonus" for used cars, part of 
which 
has already been funded, is estimated at around Fr800 million 
which corresponds to the sale of 160,000 new vehicles. Since 
the extra receipts will be insufficient, Nicolas Sarkozy 
justifies blocking Fr7 billion in credits, stressing that this 
decision applies to all administrations, including the military.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Rising Tension in Korea"] </F>
  [Text] The laconic announcement by Beijing on Friday 10 
June that China carried out a nuclear test must be seen in the 
light of the Korean crisis, which started a little over a year 
ago when Pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. Beijing is thus adding an element of 
tension to a situation which has been taking on worrying 
dimensions over the last couple of weeks. 
  The -- hitherto "soft" -- handling of the situation has 
partly concealed the increasing dangers on the peninsula. Over 
the past months, the greater part of the international community 
has adopted a moderate attitude toward the regime of Kim 
Il-song. It only vaguely threatened sanctions if Pyongyang 
persisted in refusing to allow inspections of some of its 
installations which were considered essential by the UN 
International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA. 
  This episode has not yet come to an end, because it is now 
certain that North Korea has discharged the core of its 
Yongbyong reactor without the obligatory controls to which it is 
subjected. Thus, it will no longer be possible to evade the 
proposal for sanctions which the UN Security Council is 
preparing and which will probably be debated next week. But 
this episode, which is still at the diplomatic stage, is fraught 
with difficulties and threats. 
  Difficulties: For different reasons, neither China nor 
Russia, both permanent members of the Security Council with a 
right of veto, favor the use of force. Threats: Kim Il-song's 
regime is raising its voice by stating that sanctions would be 
regarded and treated as a "declaration of war." 
  Clearly it is Beijing's position which has to be observed 
with the utmost attention from now on. It is caught in a 
dilemma, much to the confusion of its partners in the 
international community. First, it wants to succeed in its 
spectacular economic breakthrough by pushing its integration in 
the West's free market economy, and it cannot ignore that this 
implies obligations, in particular with regard to the 
recognition of the vital importance of nonproliferation for 
mankind. 
  Beijing, however, does not -- or almost not -- intend to 
give 
in on two points: first, on what it considers to be its 
"interior domain" (the form of its regime and the way it treats 
its opponents); and second, on its status of great power, in 
particular by refusing to accept U.S. world leadership. 
  So, will diplomats be able to find a solution which would 
allow China to "let down," without losing face, an old ally for 
whom, moreover, 1 million Chinese died during the Korean War? 
On the answer to this question will depend the tranquility of 
Asia and, maybe, world peace.

  [Editorial Report] President Francois Mitterrand's 
statements on a nuclear test moratorium and his stance on 
strengthening European institutions were the subjects of 
commentary in the French press. 
<H5>  Nuclear Moratorium </H5>
  Alain Chastagnol discussed Mitterrand's opposition to 
nuclear 
tests in the 6 May Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN. While nuclear 
deterrence was not mentioned in the French Government's defense 
white paper, the president has consistently opposed renewed 
nuclear testing, in contrast with Rally for the Republic (RPR) 
leader Jacques Chirac, who remarked that "French credibility 
requires that testing start again." To counter this opposition, 
Mitterrand used "mental gymnastics" to appear as the firmest 
guarantor of the nuclear strike force while simultaneously 
opposing renewed testing, Chastagnol wrote. In his latest 
statements, the president attempted to "impress" by discussing 
at length the already-existing nuclear warheads, as well as 
reaffirming that, as president, he has the exclusive right to 
make decisions in this field. Chastagnol cited him as arguing 
that President Clinton himself had extended the testing 
moratorium and that France "did not wish to offend the whole 
world" by renewing an armaments race and would substitute 
simulated nuclear tests. According to Chastagnol, these 
arguments are not convincing. Even if the United States decided 
to prolong the moratorium until September 1995, it could at that 
point end it, while relying in the interim on a simulation 
program admittedly superior to France's. Chastagnol also 
questioned Mitterrand's stated conviction that his successor in 
the presidency would not start nuclear testing. France's 
Council of Atomic Energy (CEA) has launched a study program to 
prepare for a "limitation" of nuclear tests before achieving 
successful simulations; however, Mitterrand has rejected 
previous testing and asked that simulation proceed without it. 
According to Chastagnol, the president's statement was clearly 
not aimed at national defense, but at needling Chirac while 
pleasing ecologists. The statement was also not convincing to 
those white paper skeptics disappointed by the current delays, 
postponements, and reduction of forces. "In military issues, 
uncertainty still reigns," Chastagnol concluded. 
  Writing in the 8 May LE QUOTIDIEN, Philippe Reinhard 
commented that the goal of Mitterrand's statements on defense 
was "tactical," not "strategic." Faithful to his custom before 
elections, the president wished to emphasize the differences 
between the Right and the Left and sow discord within the 
majority. He succeeded, Reinhard remarked, as part of the Right 
is "indignant" over the nuclear test ban while Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe "more sensibly and circumspectly" said that the 
president "cannot anticipate what his successor will do." 
According to Reinhard, Mitterrand has chosen the "right theme." 
A unilateral French decision in this field would be unpopular 
and weaken Paris' international position. While public opinion 
overall shows little concern over this issue, it is obvious that 
most of those who care are opposed to ending the moratorium, 
especially when France is "mobilizing" to close the Chernobyl 
site, according to Reinhard. It is also important to determine 
whether tests are needed for continued French deterrence 
capabilities, Reinhard wrote. A majority of experts, though not 
all, believe it is. However, a decision entailing troublesome 
diplomatic consequences for France ought not to be made under 
the pressure of the "military-industrial lobby." Continued 
nuclear testing is demanded by those who wish to modify indepth 
the French doctrine of deterrence. Such a "radical" change can 
only come after a national debate, Reinhard warned. 
Presidential candidates should present their proposals next 
spring and should not be drawn by President Mitterrand into a 
"politicians' polemic in which the Right has more to lose than 
the Left." 
<H5>  Mitterrand Dubbed `Last European' </H5>
  Alain Duhamel published a commentary on Mitterrand titled 
"The Last European" in the Paris daily LIBERATION of 13 May. 
"Alone in the European minefield," Mitterrand is openly in favor 
of Europe, Duhamel wrote. The European Union (EU) is blamed for 
"unemployment, insecurity, violence, anxiety, and 
marginalization." Brussels, Duhamel continued, is seen as a 
"bureaucratic multiheaded monster." Europe is used either as a 
"scapegoat," a "foil," or a "scarecrow" by politicians as 
different as Citizens' Movement leader Jean-Pierre Chevenement, 
National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, rightist Philippe de 
Villiers, Socialist Party secretary general Michel Rocard, and 
the Right's Dominique Baudis. Duhamel commented that among his 
European peers, Mitterrand is also "the last of the Mohicans." 
Europe, Duhamel wrote, "is in retreat." Mitterrand reminded 
his listeners that peace and stability require a stronger 
Europe, that France's "weight and ambition" are strengthened 
through Europe, and that the only way to fight North America or 
Southeast Asia with equal economic and political weapons is the 
EU. Duhamel observed that France, following Germany, will hold 
the EU presidency during Mitterrand's last six months in office. 
This will favor Franco-German initiatives and the launching of 
a more broadly supported European effort.

  [Excerpt] After its victory in the European elections and 
spectacular rise in Andalusia, the leadership of the People's 
Party [PP] believes that nothing will be the same from now on 
and that a period has begun when it will be necessary to take 
the PP into account before taking important decisions for the 
country. 
  The satisfaction of the PP's leadership was evident this 
evening when analyzing yesterday's results. The PP leadership 
applauded Jose Maria Aznar, Abel Matutues, and Javier Arenas. 
Estrella Moreno reports: 
  [Moreno] At the meeting of the executive committee, the PP 
chairman said that from now on the government cannot take any 
important decision without taking the PP into account. In this 
connection Aznar added that Felipe Gonzalez has to respect the 
ballot box. Further, the PP leader has asked members of the 
executive committee not to sit on their laurels but on the 
contrary to analyze what have been their shortcomings to date so 
that they can be overcome. This party also says that at the 
moment they are not euphoric but just satisfied. [passage

  [Text] The defeat by nearly 10 percentage points and the 
loss of five seats has surprised the PSOE [Spanish Socialist 
Workers Party] leaders who were expecting a less resounding 
electoral beating. Despite the fact that these were European 
elections, the Socialists admit that they have received a 
serious warning from the electorate, and that its consequences 
for domestic policy are inevitable. 
  [Correspondent Alicia Montano] Twelve years after taking 
power the PSOE is facing its first election defeat on a national 
scale. Since 1982 the party has been the one to receive the most 
votes and on three occasions has had an absolute majority. Now 
it knows that the 12 June results are a serious warning from the 
electorate from which they are prepared to draw conclusions. 
This is what the party's leaders admitted no sooner than the 
first results were known and this position was ratified this 
morning by the party's Executive Committee. In its first 
analysis, the PSOE leadership admitted that the corruption cases 
and the economic crisis have taken part of the PSOE vote to 
United Left or abstention. The Socialists trust that once these 
two problems have been tackled the hopes of its electorate will 
be rekindled. The PSOE believes that this is not the time to 
bring forward elections but to support the government and its 
stability. 
  [Begin recording, Cipria Ciscar, PSOE secretary for 
organization] The Socialist Party leadership, during its meeting 
today, is completely united around the leadership of Secretary 
General Felipe Gonzalez, and in its support for the government 
that we, the Socialists, are obliged to continue with, maintain, 
in fulfillment of the will of the people expressed in the 1993 
general elections. [end recording] 
  [Montano] Some leaders, such as Juan Carlos Rodriguez Ibarra 
[prime minister of the Extremadura regional government], said 
that the Socialist defeat was as logical as it was painful 
because things were done so badly. They recalled the damage 
that cases such as that of Mariano Rubio and Luis Roldan have 
done. There are those who believe that the disaffection of part 
of the electorate has its roots in those who call for the party 
to shift left and, therefore, believe that it is necessary to 
improve relations with the trade unions. What remains to be 
seen now is if yesterday's results will serve to bind together 
the different factions within the Socialist Party or whether, on 
the contrary, it will heighten their differences. What they all 
agree on is that the electorate has again sent a clear message.

  [Text] Madrid, June 13, IRNA -- The Iranian Embassy here 
today rejected as "baseless and utterly false" a report in the 
latest issue of the weekly TIEMPO alleging secret links between 
Iranians and the Basque separatist group ETA (Euzkadi Ta 
Azcatasuma [Basque Fatherland and Liberty]). 
  The statement said "Iranian officials believe that the 
objective behind the groundless article is to create tension in 
the friendly relations between Islamic Iran and Spain." 
  ETA which means `Basque Homeland and Liberty' was founded in 
1959 and is regarded as an `illegal terrorist' organization by 
the Spanish Government. 
  The Basques are an ethnic minority inhabiting the western 
Pyrenees mountains in northern Spain on the Bay of Biscay.

<F P=106> [Javier R. Ventosa report: "Initial Agreement on Purchase </F>
of 13 Mirage F1's From Emirate of Qatar"] 
  [Text] Spain has reached an agreement in principle with 
the Emirate of Qatar on the purchase of 13 secondhand Mirage F1 
fighter aircraft belonging to that country's Royal Air Force for 
a sum estimated at 16.5 billion pesetas, reliable military 
sources have told this newspaper. 
  The negotiations on this purchase, begun several months ago, 
recently led to the signing of a memorandum of understanding 
between the two countries, which, in the absence of a final 
agreement, shows a clear determination to carry out the 
transaction. 
<H5>  More Modern </H5>
  According to sources familiar with this operation, Spain 
would purchase 11 Mirage F1 single-seaters and two two-seaters, 
as well as spares and weapons, and the delivery of a flight 
simulator has not been ruled out. The Qatar Royal Air Force 
fighters are rather more modern than the Spanish Mirage F1's, 
but have a 90-percent degree of logistic compatibility with 
those of the Spanish Air Force. 
  Defense Ministry and Air Force sources stated that the 
operation will take another couple of months, since the project 
has still to be examined by the Council of State and approved by 
the cabinet, while some additional complications with the 
Emirate's export legislation have arisen. 
  The purchase of these fighter bombers was one of the 
priorities for the current legislative term of the Defense 
Ministry, which set itself the aim of making good the losses in 
the Spanish Mirage F1 fleet. 
  Out of the 73 aircraft of this type that Spain has purchased 
since the beginning of the seventies, 22 have been wrecked in 
accidents over the past few years, which has affected the Air 
Force's effectiveness. 
  Owing to this, the Air Force began a study of the 
international aircraft market a few months ago in order to 
examine the existing offers of secondhand F1 fighters. The 
study focused from the outset on France -- the manufacturer of 
the aircraft -- and the Arab countries, among which offers from 
Jordan, Kuwait, and Qatar were selected. 
  In addition to the purchase of fighters from Qatar, the 
planned exchange of five French Air Force Mirage F1's for two 
Spanish CN-235 transport aircraft, which would be constructed by 
Spanish Aircraft Manufacturing Inc. (CASA), has been virtually 
finalized. With this, the Air Force would receive 18 Mirage 
aircraft, which would alleviate the losses of the past few years. 
  The Spanish Mirage F1's will be in service until the 
beginning of the 21st century, when the first EF2000 fighters, 
constructed by European industry in collaboration with Spain, 
will enter into service.

<F P=106> [Manuel Abizanda report: "Air Force Needs Two More Fighter </F>
Squadrons To Guarantee National Security"] 
  [Text] The Air Force needs at least two more fighter 
squadrons -- 36 fighter bombers -- in order to guarantee 
national security and be able to perform the tasks entrusted to 
it, military sources have told ABC. Although transport aircraft 
are viewed by the Defense Ministry as its preferred aim, the Air 
Force believes that its main shortages lie in fighter aircraft, 
which have been beset by budget cuts, causing right now a 
shortfall of 60 fighter bombers from the maximum number of 
aircraft required, reckoned at 180. 
  When in the late seventies those in charge of the Air Force 
planned what the Spanish Air Force should be like at the end of 
the century, they could hardly have imagined the reality 
confronting their current successors. While at that time the 
plans proposed an Air Force with 312 fighter aircraft, of which 
240 would be F18's and the remainder Mirage F1's, the Air Force 
right now has just eight fighter squadrons with a total of 120 
aircraft; not enough, according to the aforementioned sources, 
to cope with all the operational tasks required of the Air 
Force. And although this figure of 312 aircraft seems 
excessive, taking current circumstances into account, the fact 
is that NATO itself, following the talks that led to the CFE 
[Conventional Armed Forces in Europe] treaty on the reduction of 
conventional forces in Europe, left the maximum number of 
fighter bombers for our country at 310. 
<H5>  "Statistics Are Not Lacking" </H5>
  The calculations that have been made show that the ideal 
number of fighter bombers for the Air Force would be 240 
aircraft; very far from the current figure, and one which, 
according to the Defense Ministry plans, will not be reached by 
a long shot. In order to reach this figure, the Air Force 
studies state that the ideal number of aircraft per squadron, of 
which Spain should have 10 -- something on which the Defense 
Ministry officials also agree -- would be 24. 
  "Since statistics are not lacking, and right now the rate of 
losses per squadron is six aircraft in the course of their 
useful life," the sources state, each unit would have 18 
aircraft, which is deemed the essential minimum for maintaining 
its capability. However, there is an average of 15 aircraft for 
each of the eight currently existing fighter squadrons. 
<H5>  Until 2013 </H5>
  Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that that figure of 24 
aircraft per squadron is utopian, and so the number of aircraft 
per unit has been reduced to 18. 
  The Air Force's accident rate is 0.5 aircraft for every 
10,000 flying hours, a level similar to that of the NATO 
countries, where the figure for the U.S. Air Force, for 
instance, stands at 0.42. 
  The Air Force's problem is that until the year 2013, when 
the 
last of the EF2000 aircraft will arrive, if the program does not 
suffer further delays -- something that cannot be foreseen right 
now -- the shortfall of fighter bombers will be more than 
evident. That is, that number of aircraft cannot be made up 
until 20 years hence. Moreover, according to the Defense 
Ministry, the 10 squadrons are to be made up with the 70 current 
F18's and the future 87 EF2000's, which could also be reduced at 
any time if the financial problems experienced by this program 
are not resolved. In all, there would be 157 aircraft -- again 
below that figure of 18 aircraft per squadron. 
  The solution would be the purchase of at least 36 aircraft 
in 
order to make up another two squadrons, which should be assigned 
to 21 Wing. Since the F5A's were decommissioned, this unit has 
had to perform its tasks with C-101's from the San Javier 
General Air Academy, which are unfit for combat missions in 
terms of both performance and equipment. 
  However, the Defense Ministry has rejected the offer made by 
the U.S. Air Force for Spain to purchase around 40 F16 fighter 
bombers from its surpluses. For the Air Force, those aircraft 
would be vital for making up the 10 squadrons required to 
perform its operational tasks. The Defense Ministry's grounds 
for rejecting this offer, as published by ABC, are that since it 
is a new system, it would entail higher maintenance costs, as a 
result of which in the long term and despite the good price of 
the offer -- 1 billion pesetas per aircraft -- it would be too 
expensive a transaction, in addition to the political 
difficulties that would be entailed by the purchase of a U.S. 
aircraft when the EF2000 is at a critical stage for its future. 
  The sources consulted denied that the F16 poses maintenance 
problems, "since this is an aircraft which, if it is 
characterized by anything apart from its qualities, it is its 
high level of reliability." They also pointed out that its 
maintenance is relatively simple and cited as an instance the 
fact that the aircraft of the U.S. 401 Tactical Wing stationed 
at Torrejon had an average operational readiness rate of 90 
percent while they were in Spain. 
<H5>  Interest in More F18's </H5>
  In any event, the Air Force has also held contacts with the 
U.S. Navy through the U.S. Embassy in our country, in order to 
sound out the possibility of purchasing some F18's. However, 
this possibility, which would not have the F16's' drawbacks with 
respect to maintenance and the training of pilots and 
technicians, seems very remote, since both the U.S. Navy and the 
Marines have no surpluses of this type of aircraft and have 
their whole fleet in service. 
  Even so, if the purchase of the F16's were to be made some 
day, we would still be far from the optimum figure of 180 
aircraft, since, with the F18's and Mirage F1's in service, only 
156 aircraft would be reached. 
  The future of expenditure on equipment also provokes 
disagreements. The Defense Ministry's enthusiasm for transport 
aircraft is not viewed with much optimism by the Air Force, 
although it is acknowledged that "this is what has given us most 
satisfaction over the past few months." In this connection, the 
sources consulted state that even the fleet of medium-sized 
transport aircraft, comprising Aviocar C-212's and the CN-235's, 
"is excessively large," while the fleet of C130 Hercules, with 
12 aircraft, has to redouble its efforts to perform its tasks, 
which over the past few months have ranged from mail runs to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to missions in Ruanda. "An Air Force's 
ultimate aim," they state, "is combat aircraft -- not a regular 
airline." 
<H5>  Fewer Flying Hours </H5>
  The budgetary problems have also directly affected pilot 
training, which has been reduced. This newspaper has learned 
that the Air Force clocks up 90,000 flying hours per year, which 
means that each pilot clocks up around 150 -- below the Atlantic 
alliance's minimum. Specifically, NATO prescribes a minimum of 
180 flying hours per year for its crews, so Spanish pilots are 
30 hours below that specification. The lack of fuel forced the 
Air Force general staff chiefs gradually to reduce the 
aircrafts' number of flying hours to the aforementioned 150 
hours per year. 
  Right now, 480 pilots, including those of transport 
aircraft, 
are classed as combat ready. The current forecast is that by 
the year 2000 there will be a shortfall of 18 pilots, so the 
military chiefs' worries in this sphere are "not excessive." 
Moreover, there is always the recourse of assigning pilots from 
the San Javier General Air Academy to operational units. 
  Another of the most pressing needs confronting the Air Force 
is the modernization of the fleet of P-3 Orion antisubmarine 
aircraft, of which it has seven purchased from Norway. 
Although, when they were purchased just five years ago, an 
overhaul to fit new equipment was planned, budget cuts have 
prevented this modernization from being carried out. 
  Hence they have to operate with long-outdated systems in a 
task which, owing to Spain's characteristics, with over 3,000 km 
of coastline, is regarded as very important for national 
security. Moreover, these aircraft cooperate very closely with 
the Navy in the surveillance of the Strait of Gibraltar and the 
maritime communications routes. To this must be added the fact 
that an aircraft has remained stationed at the Italian base of 
Sigonella since the embargo decreed by the United Nations 
against Serbia and Montenegro began. 
<H5>  Ammunition Problems </H5>
  Former Air Force Chief of Staff Ramon Fernandez Sequeiros 
stated in the Congress of Deputies during his last appearance on 
the occasion of the discussion of the defense budgets that the 
Air Force has been gliding for several years and is now coming 
dangerously close to the ground, and cited the fuel and 
ammunition problems as one of its main shortcomings. 
  In this connection, the renewal of the F18's' weapons with 
new Harm, Maverick, or AMRAAM missiles is being carried out very 
slowly and far from the envisaged time scales.

<F P=106> [M. Abizanda report: "Navy, Halfway There"] </F>
  [Text] Halfway there. That is how the Navy has been left 
following the budget cuts that have sunk many of its plans for 
renewal and new shipbuilding laid down in the so-called High 
Seas Plan at the end of the last decade. What should have been 
an ambitious plan to create a Navy of the year 2000, modern and 
to the highest European standards, has been reduced to just a 
few plans subject to the danger of further cuts, which have also 
caused the ships and crews to spend fewer days at sea than are 
required for their training. 
  The Spanish Navy's basic core remains based on the air-sea 
group headed by the aircraft carrier Principe de Asturias. This 
ship, the Navy's flagship, has performed and will continue to 
perform excellently, becoming, according to military experts, 
the best ship of its class currently in service. 
  However, despite the aircraft carrier's excellence, the 
air-sea group has become "lame" as far as its escorts are 
concerned. The Navy's long-standing aim to have 15 frigate-type 
escorts has come to nothing, since right now it has only nine: 
five of the Baleares class, which have various maintenance 
problems, and four much more modern Santa Maria class frigates. 
This shortage means that the Navy has been unable to deploy 
more than two frigates at once in the operation to monitor the 
embargo against Serbia and Montenegro, since it has to honor 
other commitments, such as both national and international 
maneuvers, or because of these ships' maintenance cycles. 
  This situation will be partially alleviated when the two new 
Santa Maria class ships enter into service. The first of them 
-- the F85 Navarra -- is to do so this year, since it will be 
delivered to the Navy by the Bazan National Enterprise 30 May. 
The F86 Canarias will be received by the Navy in December. In 
any event, future expectations fall far short of what was 
envisaged in the Master Plan [Plan Norte], with the construction 
of nine F100 class frigates starting from this year. 
  The budget problems have caused those nine ships to be cut 
to 
just four, whose construction will not begin until next year at 
the earliest, if the most optimistic time scales are fulfilled. 
Right now, following the memorandum of understanding signed by 
Spain, the Netherlands, and Germany last January, the project's 
feasibility stage is coming to a close. These four frigates 
should strengthen one of the fleet's weakest points -- 
antiaircraft defense -- being equipped with a radar system 
capable of tracking and firing at more targets simultaneously 
than the Santa Maria class frigates can do. 
  The drastic cuts came at a crucial time for the Navy, with a 
gradual involvement in international operations and greater 
participation in maneuvers with the allies. Moreover, Spain is 
one of those promoting the setting up of a European air-sea 
group in the Mediterranean, which undoubtedly means having a 
well-equipped Navy. 
  As in the case of the Air Force, preference is also given by 
the Defense Ministry to transport and support ships, although 
new shipbuilding is also at a standstill, except for the AOR 
[expansion unknown], the supply ship which will be launched 
within the next few weeks. The AOR will have the capacity to 
transport 6,800 tonnes of diesel oil in order to supply the 
Principe de Asturias and its escorts, and 500 tonnes of JP-5 
fuel for the Harrier aircraft of the air unit aboard the 
aircraft carrier. 
  The High Seas Plan, drawn up during Fernando Nardiz' time 
as Navy chief of staff, envisaged the commissioning of five 
amphibious vessels, whereas the situation right now is that both 
the Aragon and the Castilla -- the two attack transport ships -- 
have reached the end of their useful lives without clear 
replacements. 
  The first solution has been to hire from the U.S. Navy two 
amphibious vessels with 20 years on their logbooks, due to 
arrive in Spain between this year and the beginning of 1995. 
Another solution -- that of constructing a Landing Platform 
Dock amphibious vessel in Spain -- is also at a critical stage 
right now. Naval sources consulted stated that the work order 
should be carried out this year, since because this is a joint 
project with the Netherlands, which has already taken a decision 
to this effect, many of the results of this cooperation could be 
lost, with the consequent increase in the project's cost. 
  The need for these ships, repeatedly expressed by Defense 
Minister Julian Garcia Vargas, stems from the support for the 
ground forces that have to be transported in carrying out 
international missions, as is the case with operation Alpha 
Bravo in the former Yugoslavia. 
  But of there is a part of the Navy where the future is not 
at 
all bright, it is in the submarine fleet. While the 
above-mentioned plan forecast in one of its most optimistic 
sections the construction of up to 10 submarines to replace the 
Delfin and Agosta class submarines, the harsh reality is that 
the designing of this new type of vessel is at a standstill, and 
the current fleet of eight vessels could even be halved before 
the end of the century. 
  It is acknowledged by the Defense Ministry itself that the 
submarine fleet is experiencing difficulties -- especially the 
four Delfin class vessels. In fact, the major refits of the S64 
Narval, required in order to guarantee a submarine's safety, 
have been suspended, and this in turn is causing major 
difficulties in accomplishing the submarine force's operating 
cycle. Defense sources told ABC that the S64 will be dropped 
from the list of Navy vessels this year, although they 
emphatically asserted that it will not be scrapped. The 
submarine will be mothballed, as is done by the U.S. Navy with 
the units it decommissions, making possible its recovery if 
circumstances so require. 
  For this reason, the Navy could begin the next decade with 
just four submarines, although it is a weapon of considerable 
deterrent capability because of the danger it poses to shipping 
and free movement in ports. 
  Some sectors in the Navy are in favor of scrapping the 
oldest 
submarines to make it possible to use the funds earmarked for 
their maintenance for other, more pressing, needs. 
  All this comes four years after Admiral Carlos Vila, Juan 
Jose Romero Caramelo's predecessor as Navy chief of staff, 
warned when he took office that he was unable with the resources 
then at his disposal to ensure the performance of all the tasks 
entrusted. 
  And the fact is that Vila also had to see the Navy part with 
a large proportion of its patrol boats, partly because the 
Maritime Civil Guard took over responsibility for the 
surveillance of territorial waters and because scrapping those 
ships made it possible to earmark funds for other, more 
pressing, needs. Nevertheless, the Navy has strengthened its 
capability as far as deep-sea patrol boats are concerned. 
  The program to construct four minehunters at the Bazan 
shipyard in Cartagena has also been activated. Although the 
High Seas Plan put at eight the number of ships for antimine 
warfare, their high cost made it advisable to reduce the plan to 
the aforementioned four ships. 
<H5>  Air Arm </H5>
  The Fleet Air Arm has been strengthened through the purchase 
for 46 billion pesetas in 1992 of eight Harrier-plus aircraft 
that will replace the older models. Nevertheless, the cuts have 
affected the helicopters, since the number of SH-60 Seahawks -- 
six -- has proved too low to meet all requirements, especially 
with the entry of more frigates into the fleet.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Bo Stenstrom: "Well, No, She Doesn't Know Yet"] </F>
  [Text] The Trade and Industry Delegation's recent public 
opinion poll on the EU [European Union] is more interesting than 
news reports have indicated, notes Bo Stenstrom. 
  It is certainly interesting that attitudes toward the EU 
have 
scarcely changed since late last fall. According to the poll 
conducted by the Trade and Industry Delegation (EVA in Finnish) 
to ascertain our opinions on the EU, the number of supporters 
has risen from 39 to 40 percent. That change is within the 
margin of error. 
  The decline on the no side from 41 to 37 percent is clearer. 
Most of that 4 percent wound up in the undecided column. A full 
29 percent of the women in this poll are undecided. That is the 
afterglow of the rush to fence-sitting that was caused by the 
Rehn phenomenon and that has been measured in other polls since 
January. 
  Little has changed in people's opinions of the EU over the 
past year -- despite the fact that during that time we 
negotiated an EU agreement, despite the attack on the White 
House in Moscow, despite the Russian election results, despite 
the fact that the EEA [European Economic Area] has come into 
being, and despite the fact that we have gotten a GATT agreement. 
  It is still the case that only 16 percent are absolutely and 
completely certain that they will vote yes on the EU, while 20 
percent are equally certain that they will vote no. The 
undecided group has grown from 20 to 23 percent. The minor 
changes since last fall mean that a very slim majority of no 
votes has turned into a somewhat clearer majority of yes votes. 
But ordinary people have nevertheless gotten the impression that 
there has been a rush to the yes side. 
  No such rush has occurred, but the EVA's surveys, which 
follow the same pattern as the European barometers, provide a 
great deal of interesting material under their calm surface. 
  It is still the case that only a minority is ready to throw 
neutrality overboard as being unnecessary, and the Zhirinovskiy 
factor is not as clear-cut as foreign visitors are often told. 
It is true that 54 percent think we would be safer in the EU in 
the face of an unstable Russia, but that does not constitute a 
dramatic change. 
  That is good. We cannot claim that we are joining the EU 
and, 
for example, Partnership for Peace with no intention of gaining 
security guarantees -- because we do not feel threatened -- 
while at the same time joking (?!) with visitors that we ought 
to get Zhirinovskiy to threaten us before the referendum. Such a 
statement has been made. 
  A striking change has occurred in the way voters between the 
ages of 18 and 25 feel about the EU. Their attitude is now 
unfavorable (35 percent for and 38 percent against). Maybe this 
means we can avoid the populism that both finalists in the 
presidential election and spokesmen for industry have flirted 
with in their talk about lowering the voting age to 16 in time 
for the referendum. 
  Since the youngest voters have been more favorable to the EU 
than their grandparents until now, it has been said that those 
who are going to live the longest within the EU ought to have 
more to say about it. On the other hand, what this means is that 
the generations that defended the country and brought those 
children into the world are too senile to realize what is good 
for the country and take responsibility for what is best for 
their children and grandchildren. 
  There is no minimum age limit for those who want to 
influence 
the decision through, for example, the pages of 
HUFVUDSTADSBLADET, but the voting age itself is fine the way it 
is. If it is lowered, participation in elections will also 
decline, and what we are talking about here is not just opinions 
but also experience in life and citizenship. 
  Most women are opposed to the EU (34 percent in favor, 38 
percent opposed). In their case, concern over social protection 
plays an important role. Women are not so unaware that they do 
not know that social policy is still a national matter within 
the EU. On the other hand, it may be hard for Finland to 
maintain a different and more expensive model here on the 
periphery than that adopted by those at the center of the EU. 
Women need only listen to the insidious ideological values being 
presented under cover of the EU. 
  To be sure of a yes vote, it will soon be necessary to 
restrict voting eligibility to middle-aged male university 
graduates who live in Uusimaa, belong to the Conservative Party, 
and have good incomes and jobs in leading positions. 
  The Center Party's dilemma is illustrated by the fact that 
opponents lead by 58 to 22 percent, but the situation is not 
easy for the Social Democrats, either, even though the yes side 
has grown, with the score now standing at 51 to 27 percent. In 
the SAK [Finnish Confederation of Trade Unions], opinion is 
almost evenly divided at 36 percent for and 39 percent against. 
  This means that an untimely election at the same time as a 
referendum will involve a risk both for the yes side and for the 
Social Democratic Party. 
  A full 21 percent of those polled link Finland's membership 
with that of the Nordic region. This means another risk if that 
group, which knows it is deliberately being denied maximum 
insight into the election situation, is forced to the ballot box 
as bait for brother countries when the opposition there is 
presumably stronger than just before election day. Why would one 
not let oneself be influenced by them? 
  There are also other uncertain factors. There is a 
misconception that it would be possible to learn everything one 
needed to know if there were adequate information. 
  It is possible to gain a reasonable understanding of the 
EU's 
various aspects today and even of the role assigned to Finland 
by the EU agreement. But how the EU will affect us in the long 
run, what the EU will develop into, and what external (military 
or economic) factors will give rise to -- that is a different 
matter. 
  We must make that judgment and accept responsibility for it 
so that strong special interests will not decide the matter to 
their own advantage, and then we must also accept responsibility 
for the losing side, regardless of which side that is.

<F P=106> [Report by Ann Svarding: "Japanese Want Swedish `Yes' to EU </F>
Membership"] 
  [Text] Many Japanese companies are on the way to investing 
in Sweden. However, before they make their final decisions, 
they want to know what the situation is regarding European Union 
[EU] membership and the Oresund bridge. 
  "Swedish membership in the EU is a precondition for 
receiving 
this Japanese investment," Elisabeth Lindquist, a market 
consultant with the Japanese export organization JETRO [Japan 
External Trade Organization] in Stockholm, said. "That 
membership and the Oresund bridge are the two most important 
factors," Carl Henrik Hamrin, economic advisor to the Swedish 
Embassy in Tokyo, added. 
  According to Carl Henrik Hamrin, a total of four Japanese 
companies could already make their investment decisions within 
the coming months. Some of them will probably make their 
decision before the EU referendum in November. It depends on 
whether or not they bank on Swedish EU membership. 
<H5>  Companies on the Way </H5>
  In addition, another 20 or so companies are at various 
stages 
of planning business start-ups in Sweden. 
  "There is a whole string of Japanese companies currently 
considering going into Sweden. In all cases, Swedish EU 
membership is one of the most important preconditions for this," 
Carl Henrik Hamrin said. 
  "The next most important question is the Oresund bridge. If 
I am going to be quoted, then I merely wish to say: `Build the 
bridge!' The transport issue is extremely important." 
<H5>  "Billions of Kronor" </H5>
  According to Carl Henrik Hamrin, the Japanese investment 
plans concern "billions of kronor." 
  "If Sweden says no, then an investment process that is 
already under way will be curtailed. Over the last two or three 
years, 10 Japanese companies have pumped approximately 200 
million kronor into Sweden," Carl Henrik Hamrin said. 
  He pointed out that many Japanese regard the popular 
referendum to be a proper election situation. They do not have 
referenda themselves, and therefore regard the upcoming 
referendum more as a necessary step in the whole process. Their 
opinion, he maintained, is that the important decision was made 
when the European Parliament approved Swedish accession in 
principle. 
  The EU issue as a whole is of great concern to Japanese 
companies. 
  "They are tremendously curious about what will happen if the 
EU really becomes a trade bloc and if it comes to adopting a 
position either in support of or against Japan," Tommy Kullberg, 
trade secretary at the Swedish Export Council in Tokyo, said. 
  Yukio Matsui, CEO of the Mitsui trading house in Sweden, 
told 
DAGENS INDUSTRI that his company is starting to follow not only 
the specific question of Swedish membership, but more 
particularly the development of the EU as a whole. Yukio Matsui 
sees the EU as a kind of insurance policy for the Swedish people 
to reach a larger market. 
<H5>  Newly Awakened Interest </H5>
  The Japanese interest in Sweden is relatively new. In the 
current situation, characterized by a strong yen, an altogether 
excessive Japanese trade surplus, and high Japanese labor costs, 
Japanese companies are being forced to set up abroad. 
  "On the plus side, Sweden has low labor costs for a highly 
trained work force," Elisabeth Lindquist said. 
<H5>  High-Tech Companies </H5>
  According to Carl Henrik Hamrin, several of the planned 
business start-ups in Sweden concern high-tech companies. 
  Over the last 12 months, Sweden's exports to Japan have 
risen 
by 50 percent to reach a level of 10 billion kronor. The 
increase in volume over the same period has amounted to 25 
percent. The increase is due both to currency advantages and to 
a number of new Swedish businesses starting up in Japan.

<F P=106> [Article by Mats Knutson: "No-Voter Forms His Own"] </F>
  [Text] Member of Parliament Bjorn von der Esch, Moderate 
Party, from Vagnharad, who was rejected [from the party list], 
is forming his own party to continue his opposition to the 
European Union [EU]. 
  "I am convinced that it is possible to get into the 
Riksdag," 
he says. 
  In the election this fall he hopes to be able to gather 
no-voters in Sodermanland Province from all political parties. 
The new party will enter the election on one issue -- preventing 
Swedish membership in the EU. The names on the list will span 
the entire political field, according to Bjorn von der Esch. 
  "The yes side has joined from left to right. The no side 
should do the same," he believes, and this weekend he will 
travel to Lund to talk some more about his plans during the 
organization No to EU's convention. 
  The party name is still secret, however. 
  "The period for registration of party names has ended. If I 
were now to say what the list will be called, anyone could steal 
the name." 
  Bjorn von der Esch was rejected by the Moderates because of 
his strong opposition to the EU. Since then, support for him has 
been strong both from friends in the party and others. However, 
12 percent of the votes in the election are needed to enter the 
Riksdag from a list in Sodermanland Province. 
  "If I succeed, it will really give the political 
establishment something to think about. In the Riksdag 
opposition to the EU is represented by only 3-4 percent of the 
delegates, while more than half the Swedish people has a 
negative opinion." 
  Hans Lindqvist, chairman of the organization No to EU, 
welcomes the initiative. 
  "He will certainly do very well. There are lots of 
nonsocialist voters who are critical of the EU."

<F P=106> [Article by Lena Hennel: "EU Opposition Growing in Yes </F>
Stronghold" -- introductory paragraphs in italics as published] 
  [Excerpts] No to EU [European Union] is holding its 
convention in the midst of the stronghold of the yes side. The 
clearest support for Swedish membership is found in Scania. 
  On that point the opinion polls have been unequivocal 
so far. It is therefore not a coincidence that the EU opponents 
have chosen to flex their muscles precisely in Lund; yesterday 
they presented their message during a demonstration, and their 
top figure and Scanian Per Gahrton gave a speech. During the 
ongoing No to EU weekend, SVENSKA DAGBLADET went to Landskrona 
to feel which way the EU wind is blowing. 
  Landskrona -- In June the ferries will resume crossing 
Oresund between Landskrona and Copenhagen, and for the first 
time in several years Landskrona residents will be able to take 
a return trip to Denmark in about an hour. 
  The municipality has stepped in as a guarantor for the 
traffic, since it is hoped that Danes will be enticed to come 
and live on the Swedish side of the sound. Already 50 Danish 
families have found a home in the little Scanian town where 
rents and taxes are lower than in Denmark. 
  The nonsocialist municipal government, which took over in 
the 
last election from the Social Democrats who had governed the 
municipal district for 70 years with simple majorities, is 
working with determination to tie Landskrona more tightly to 
Europe. 
  "EU is a future opportunity for Landskrona, and membership 
could help us solve some of our problems," explains municipal 
councillor Inga Jansson, Liberal Party. 
<H5>  Has Had a Difficult Time </H5>
  The once so prosperous industrial city of Landskrona has had 
a difficult time in recent years. The high unemployment began 
with the shipyard crisis in the 1980's. Oresundsvarvet was shut 
down and 3,000 employees were laid off. 
  It was a hard blow for a municipal region of 30,000 to lose 
that many jobs in one blow. Other industrial enterprises 
followed suit and unemployment rose. 
  But after a long period of pessimism, life is beginning to 
brighten for the municipality. 
  The shipyard is operating once again on a small scale; a new 
industrial area is growing up along the E6 highway; Landskrona 
BOIS [football club] has managed to climb into the all-Swedish 
league after many years; and the Strandpaviljongen dance 
restaurant, which burned down last year, has been rebuilt. 
  The interesting Skanska Teatern recently went bankrupt, to 
be 
sure, but it is hoped that the activity can be reconstructed. 
And -- as was mentioned -- the ferries are beginning to operate 
again. 
<H5>  Vision of Orestad </H5>
  But another push forward is needed; unemployment is still 
high and the belief in the future is badly dented. The municipal 
politicians and the employers' association are hoping that an EU 
membership will supply the longed-for miracle. 
  Down by the beach, with the back toward Landskrona castle, 
built by Christian III in 1549 at the time Landskrona was still 
Danish, and with the eyes aimed at Oresund, this area near 
Denmark is tangible. The houses of Copenhagen are visible and 
the old vision about an Orestad, which was to link Copenhagen, 
Malmo, and the municipal regions around them, does not feel 
strange. 
  But now Landskrona's politicians are aiming more toward 
becoming a vital part of the Scania-Sealand region. The EU has a 
positive attitude toward regional cooperation, and in Scania 
many are convinced that Scania-Sealand will be able to compete 
with other European regions. [passage omitted] 
  But his criticism is more serious than that. He fears the EU 
will mean that the rest of the world is closed off from Europe. 
"We should trade with the whole world." 
  He does not believe that the Scanians are more favorable 
toward the EU because of their vicinity to Denmark: 
  "Mind you, it has been 10 years since I have been to 
Denmark. 
Sure, I have taken trips, gone back and forth with the boat 
across the sound and had a beer and a little food. But I have 
not gone ashore in 10 years." 
  On a ladder leaning against one of the beautiful stone 
houses 
on Queen Street stands Lars Persson cleaning windows. He is one 
of those favoring membership in the EU opinion polls. 
  "Even if there is a lot of nonsense with the EU, we have to 
belong. Sweden cannot close itself off," in his opinion. 
  Retirees Tora Persson and Greta Svensson are walking down by 
the harbor, on their way to take the boat to Ven for a day trip 
and a picnic. That is something the two friends have done each 
spring for the last 20 years. The short boat trip is "just right 
for us landlubbers." 
  They say that they have actually taken a little EU course, 
but they do not think they learned much from it. Nevertheless, 
the outcome was that EU membership is inevitable. 
  "We must probably participate. A country as small as Sweden 
cannot manage otherwise," says Tora Persson. 
  Greta Svensson has not detected any brightening for 
Landskrona. It is only the municipal politicians who want it to 
look that way, she believes.

<F P=106> [Article by Sigfrid Leijonhufvud: "Social Democrats Believe </F>
in Higher Growth"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the Social Democratic Party [SDP] 
presented the guidelines for a "new economic policy," which is 
largely a carbon copy of the party's shadow budget from January. 
  But the emphasis has shifted yet a little further away from 
last year's proposal for a consumer-driven increase toward an 
investment-driven one. This is evident in part from the fact 
that the party does not repeat its demand to restore the basic 
deduction to 32 percent of the basic amount from the present 25. 
(On that point the account in yesterday's SVENSKA DAGBLADET 
regarding what could be expected was not correct.) 
  Through a number of incentives -- all of them temporary -- 
both as regards employment and investments, the Social Democrats 
expect in their alternative that they will get the economy to 
grow much more rapidly than if the Riksdag sticks to the 
government's proposal. The government anticipated 2.4 percent 
economic growth for 1994, both in the national budget and the 
now current spring budget. With Social Democratic policies the 
growth will be 3.3 percent, compared to 3.4 in the shadow 
budget. For next year the government believes in 3-percent 
growth, while the Social Democrats maintain that they can 
achieve as much as a 4.5 upturn with their policies. Among other 
established prognosis-makers Nordbanken has come up with growth 
figures that exceed the government's. The Industry Association 
and LO [Federation of Trade Unions] are at 1.3 and 1.2 percent, 
respectively, for this year and below 2 percent for 1995. 
  One novelty in the Social Democratic party bill is the 
proposal for a new "social contract" between wage earners, 
employers, and the state. 
  Both Goran Persson, the party's financial spokesman, and 
party secretary Mona Sahlin, at yesterday's news conference 
stressed the course of mutual understanding which they now say 
they want to pursue -- despite devastating criticism of the 
government alternative. The new social contract would constitute 
an important part of this. 
  However, the Social Democrats' intended minister of finance 
wanted to dispel the fears/hopes that the state intends to 
introduce an income policy by saying: 
  "It is not a matter of anything written, and I see neither 
Haga nor Harpsund in front of me." 
<H5>  Praises Backstrom </H5>
  After the dissenting opinion on the appointment of Urban 
Backstrom as new head of the Bank of Sweden, and the criticism 
which the Social Democrats heaped on him after his open hearing 
in the Finance Committee, Persson surprised everyone with a 
confidence-creating statement about the new head of the Bank of 
Sweden: 
  "I think that Urban Backstrom is doing a good job," Persson 
said, but he did not go so far as to promise that the head of 
the Bank of Sweden would remain after a potential change of 
power this fall. 
  The fact that Goran Persson is making positive statements 
about the contributions by the former under secretary of state 
(Conservative) at least indicates that he realizes the danger of 
fanning rumors that a change would be part of a new government's 
plans. It would in all likelihood drive the interest rates up. 
  Goran Persson does not hide his opinion that the Bank of 
Sweden has previously missed several opportunities to push the 
interest rate down, but he had no criticism of the policy being 
pursued in today's situation. It is evident from the party bill, 
however, that monetary policy should be formed on the basis of 
more indicators than the development of inflation. What the 
party is aiming for is that the monetary policy outside the 
inflation goal should also be designed for an ambitious growth 
target for the entire economy. 
  The Social Democrats' new/old arsenal of stimulus measures 
includes a program aimed at youth unemployment, in which the 
goal is for every unemployed person under 25 to be offered a job 
or other active measures within the period of 100 days. 
  On the investment side, an entire battery of measures is 
included, with direct deductions as number one. Up to 70 percent 
of the investments for machinery by business and industry may be 
deducted during the first year. It is proposed that the measure 
should take effect on 1 July this year and last for one year. 
The investments are expected to increase by 6 billion in 1995 as 
a result of just that measure. Business and industry 
organizations are skeptical, and some critics are of the opinion 
that the measure prepares for a tax planning which the Social 
Democrats in other connections oppose. 
<H5>  Incentive Subsidy </H5>
  The expansion of the AXE [communications network] system is 
moved up in the Social Democratic proposal, which also wants to 
accelerate maintenance investments in the highway network. The 
party further proposes 20-percent incentive subsidies for more 
ROT [repair, renovation, expansion] activity in apartments and a 
10-percent temporary investment subsidy for new housing 
construction begun before the turn of the year. 
  For next year the Social Democrats propose savings -- 
agriculture, defense, etc. -- of 65 billion kronor and income 
supplements in the form of tax increases amounting to 3.8 
billion. They oppose child care allowance and oppose the 
proposal for a new unemployment insurance. 
  "Unfinanced tax cuts and new social reforms must get off the 
agenda," it says in the bill. 
  That opinion is not just aimed at the government side. Goran 
Persson has not foreseen any new social reforms even in the 
party's own version. If he becomes finance minister, he will 
have a tough enough time anyway, one could imagine.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mino Fuccillo: "Berlusconi's Miracle"] </F>
  [Text] For over two years, ever since that faraway 5 April 
1992, the Italian electorate has been shifting with increasing 
velocity, giving rise to veritable "mass migrations." Again 
yesterday the citizens of this Republic -- European electors for 
a day -- set off in a long procession, lock, stock, and ballot 
papers. Their destination: Silvio Berlusconi's government. A 
march under the banners of the center-right. A race to 
strengthen the victors of two months ago. A massive display of 
confidence and a huge, urgent need to become part of the growing 
triumphant army. Within the space of a few weeks, millions of 
votes have shifted and have transformed what was a relative 
majority into the country's absolute majority. Even before his 
promised new economic miracle, Silvio Berlusconi has achieved 
the miracle of consensus. 
  Only two months ago the forces of the center-right had 43 
percent of the Italian people's votes. A first-past-the-post 
system granted them the unquestionable right to govern. But 
almost 60 percent of Italians displayed in various ways their 
mistrust, if not their hostility, toward them. Yesterday, 
however, Silvio Berlusconi achieved something like the landslide 
victory for which he called. The combination of the votes of 
Forza Italia, the National Alliance [AN], the League, and 
Pannella's reform group -- that is, the government majority -- 
is well over 50 percent. 
  In Italy now, the opposition to the Berlusconi government is 
in the minority, even from the proportional viewpoint. This is 
the first, spectacular, effect of the latest "migration" which 
enabled Forza Italia to gain an additional 10 percent of votes 
over the result of the March elections. 
  Not only is the majority growing quickly, but its 
characteristics are also changing. Forza Italia and the AN now 
claim some 44 percent of the votes. In the future, they could 
be tempted to go it alone, if necessary, without the League. 
Indeed, in a first-past-the-post system it is possible to win 
and to govern with near 40 percent. So the way is clear for the 
center-right single party, that of Berlusconi and [AN leader] 
Fini together. If he wants, [League Secretary] Bossi can follow 
the path set out by the other two. If that does not suit him, 
he could of course prompt a government crisis, but as of today 
we know that the other two can do without him. Like it or not, 
the League is cornered, stands watching the procession of voters 
toward Berlusconi, and cannot stop it, but can only join it or 
remain alone. Like it or not, Panella is also a mere accessory, 
a useful adjunct, but an adjunct nevertheless. 
  The center-right bulldozer runs on a kind of gas that nobody 
else has: The Italian people believe in Silvio Berlusconi and 
his promises -- at least for the present. This is the key to 
yesterday's election result, and it is this that enabled Forza 
Italia to reach a level of support that only the DC [Christian 
Democratic Party] before it enjoyed. The Italian people believe 
in, and want to believe in, a new season of prosperity. They do 
not want to let go of the possibility that prosperity will 
arrive tomorrow, or even today, and moreover, basically without 
much effort. Indeed, they have used their votes to punish those 
who doubt it. No reasoning can prevail against it; the 
"procession" demolishes every obstacle. It wins new coverts, 
thrives on genuine confidence, enlists old forms of opportunism, 
and feeds on conformism and hope. And Silvio Berlusconi is in 
the driver's seat. He can, if he wants, dump the defeated 
League. He can, if he wants, create the great center-right 
party with Fini. He can calmly await the arrival of the last 
penitents from the drained center. 
  Indeed, the center that was identified with the DC and the 
referendums is not holding together and is inevitably 
disintegrating. The Popular Party and Segni's Pact have lost 
about one-fourth of the votes they had two months ago. The idea 
that nothing can be done either with Forza Italia or with the 
progressive forces has not been taken up by the voters. The 
center opposition is about to become a mere token stance. So it 
is easy to predict that the Popular Party will be subjected to 
tensions that could cut it into slices and that one of these 
slices will decide to join the "procession." 
  So while the center is working on a political hypothesis 
that 
seems insubstantial to the voters, things are certainly not much 
better for the progressive forces. Their percentage of the 
votes has fallen by a few points but, what is worse, the first 
symptoms of political asphyxia are starting to appear. The PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] suffered losses, which shows the 
high cost of every week spent contemplating its defeat in March. 
If the progressive forces do not change their language, habits, 
and political strategy right away, it is likely a long season of 
decline will begin for them. It is not just a matter of a 
secretary or a leadership group, though one cannot pretend there 
is no leadership problem. Now one can hope, for the sake of the 
progressive forces, that the PDS will alter its cautious 
internal timetable. Now one can hope, for the sake of the 
progressive forces, that no one will make any excuses. 
  The PDS has less than 20 percent, Rete is virtually 
nonexistent, and the Democratic Alliance and the Socialists are 
decimated. On its own, the Left will die, whichever party 
symbol it uses as its banner. And it would be hardly any 
consolation for the progressive forces to cite the stability of 
Communist Renewal and the modest success of the Greens. There 
is no magic spell for the progressive forces and there is 
presently no alternative to Berlusconi ready in Italian society. 
But at least one thing is clear: The Left, on its own, 
commands the support of one Italian in three. If it ever wants 
to govern this country it must start changing its 
representatives and its language; then it can try to change the 
country's political geography and try to halt the "procession." 
But it is pointless to stand watching it, knocking on wood. 
  The vote was for Europe, but the Italian people gladly 
forgot 
the fact. Instead, en masse, they took the opportunity to shout 
that they want to be governed by Silvio Berlusconi and no other. 
They did not care too much for subtleties: On the stock 
exchange of politics, of social interests and values, more jobs 
and less taxes are now worth more than anything else. 
Berlusconi does not frighten them; indeed, he attracts them. 
And Fini does not frighten them very much either, judging from 
the fact that the MSI [Italian Social Movement] paid only a tiny 
price for the polemics over government neofascism. Indeed, it 
is more likely that the few votes that the National Alliance 
lost went to Forza Italia, as though attracted by some kind of 
gravitational force. A great number of League supporters have 
also become converts to Forza Italia, even though, or perhaps 
precisely because, Bossi is threatening to end the idyll. Center 
supporters who do not want to miss the promised chance to party 
have converted to Forza Italia. However, the procession still 
excludes the Left, which has been deprived of all hope and whose 
outlook has become uncertain. If there is a leadership out 
there, please speak up. It is already very late -- never mind 
about tomorrow. 
  Italy now is placing its trust in and consigning itself to 
Silvio Berlusconi. So let him govern, as best he can. As of 
today, power is certainly not something he lacks. The country 
is following him in a procession, and he and he alone will take 
the credit for a new miracle or an old disaster.

  [Text] A short time ago, a Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation 
correspondent reported from Luxembourg that the European Union 
[EU] Council of Foreign Ministers has approved a joint statement 
on the Cyprus issue. In their statement the 12 ministers blame 
the Turkish Cypriot side for the failure of the talks and plan 
to discuss the Cyprus issue at the EU summit in Corfu. 
  According to our correspondent, during the second day of its 
session the council asked Serge Abou, the EU observer at the 
Cyprus talks, to present a new report at the EU summit. The 
council has also approved the Cyprus-EU Fourth Financial 
Protocol, which amounts to ECU74 million.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis began his talks 
on the Cyprus issue in New York by meeting with the UN secretary 
general's senior adviser. Today, Mikhailidhis will have 
successive talks with the representatives of the 15 UN Security 
Council member states and Alternate UN Secretary General Marrack 
Goulding. 
  In a statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation 
correspondent in New York, the foreign minister said that a new 
report by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is 
unjustified and will set a bad precedence. He added that the 
recent talks between Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
alternate special representative in Cyprus, and Turkish Cypriot 
leader Rauf Denktas do not justify the issuing of a new report. 
  Referring to the telephone conversation between U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and President Glavkos 
Kliridhis, Mikhailidhis said that the call was designed to 
encourage efforts on the confidence-building measures procedure 
to continue. Discussing the U.S. position, Mikhailidhis 
rejected claims that Cyprus-U.S. relations are being disturbed, 
describing them as relations of continuous and close 
communication. 
  Mikhailidhis will meet the UN secretary general on Thursday 
[16 June]. It has not yet been decided whether he will go to 
Washington for talks with U.S. State Department officials.

  [Text] A provision on the confidence-building measures has 
been included in a modified draft UN Security Council resolution 
on the renewal of the UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] mandate in 
Cyprus. Specifically, the draft resolution stresses the urgent 
need to implement the confidence-building measures that are 
mentioned in UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report 
on the Cyprus issue dated 1 July 1993. 
  The draft resolution, which suggests the renewal of the 
UNFICYP mandate for another six months, mentions that the UN 
Security Council will reconsider the situation in Cyprus, 
specifically the role of the United Nations, within the 
framework of the UN secretary general's report of 30 May 1994. 
  The draft resolution calls on both sides to commit 
themselves 
to significantly reducing the number of foreign troops that are 
in the Republic of Cyprus and to reduce defense spending to help 
restore confidence, which is the first step toward the 
withdrawal of all non-Cypriot forces as provided in 
Butrus-Ghali's set of ideas. 
  The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent reported 
from New York that the draft resolution will be presented for 
approval to the Security Council either today or tomorrow.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis today said he has made 
it clear that he will resign from his post, if necessary, to 
give the people the opportunity to decide whether they want 
further discussion on the confidence-building measures, or 
whether they prefer to insist on effective alternative 
procedures before negotiations on the substance of the issue 
that will open the way for a solution are held. 
  He added: If the UN Security Council follows this procedure, 
we would be ready to help the secretary general find a just and 
viable solution to the Cyprus problem. The president said he 
has made it clear that he remains committed to the 21 March UN 
document on implementing the confidence-building measures that 
was prepared by the UN secretary general's representatives, and 
in his report Butrus-Ghali described it as a fair and balanced 
document. 
  The president made this statement this morning during an 
address at a ceremony to receive the credentials of the new 
Jordanian ambassador to Cyprus.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas received Gustav Feissel, the 
UN secretary general's deputy special representative, today. 
Speaking after the meeting, which was requested by Feissel, 
President Denktas said that the UN General Secretariat has 
continued to insist on not including the benefits that will be 
created for the Turkish Cypriot side in the agreement and moved 
to put forward new demands on Maras [Varosha]. Denktas asserted: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] Mr. Feissel requested to meet us 
today. They are expecting us to be more flexible on various 
issues. The main problem is whether or not the rights that will 
be given to the Turkish Cypriots will be effectively included in 
the document on draft ideas, which is known as the 21 March 
document. He has proposed that the UN secretary general could 
convey letters to me and Glavkos Kliridhis outlining the rights 
of the Turkish Cypriots. It is impossible to understand why he 
has made such a proposal. 
  A draft proposal remains as it is until it is given a form 
that is acceptable to both sides. A draft is drawn up in order 
for the sides to work on it. We have done that in goodwill. We 
have maintained as flexible an approach as we can. However, it 
seems that they are still not satisfied. 
  Mr. Feissel will meet with us again at 1600 tomorrow. 
Meanwhile, we shall assess the situation. However, we have 
resolutely asked the following: Since you agree to change the 
draft document on matters related to the customs houses and the 
demilitarization of the area that is under our control in Maras, 
why do you not agree to effectively include the rights to be 
recognized for the Turkish Cypriots in it? Unfortunately, he 
has been unable to reply to that question. 
  Another point is as follows: Glavkos Kliridhis made a 
statement during the past week to the effect that the draft 
document, which he described as the 21 March document, is dead 
and that he will neither discuss it nor agree to any new idea on 
it. I asked Mr. Feissel if he brought a message from Kliridhis. 
I asked him whether Kliridhis will agree to continue the 
negotiations process if the Turkish Cypriot side adopts a 
flexible approach on this or that problem? No, there is no such 
thing. In that case, why should we waste our time? Why is Mr. 
Feissel occupied with us when the other side has withdrawn? Why 
has he not tried to convince the other side to agree to resume 
the negotiations? We received no reply to those questions. 
  Mr. Feissel made a number of requests. We have to assess the 
situation among us. We shall receive him at 1600 tomorrow. 
[end recording] 
  Replying to a question, President Denktas recalled that the 
Turkish Cypriot side has agreed to have the military troops on 
both sides of the access road to Maras withdraw to a point 400 
meters away in order not to be seen. However, he stressed that 
the UN officials have asked that the military units be withdrawn 
to a point one mile or one km away from that road. 
  [Begin Denktas recording] We cannot agree to that from the 
point of view of our security and the maintenance of our 
existing authority. However, as I mentioned earlier, we shall 
make a new assessment. Mr. Feissel was unable to reply to our 
question as to whether or not Kliridhis would agree to have the 
document, dated 21 March, changed and include our demands in it. 
No positive reply was forthcoming. In that case, why should I 
agree to be flexible for no reason at all? That question also 
remained unanswered. 
  He informed us that we should take a flexible approach and 
allow the UN Security Council to assess which side is lagging 
behind. Which UN Security Council are we talking about? France 
is being paid by the Greek Cypriots in order to renovate and 
dispatch more than 90 tanks to them. Those tanks were 
transferred to France from Greece. Russia will sell 134 tanks 
to the Greek Cypriots. 
  The draft resolution to extend the mandate of the UN Forces 
in Cyprus for another six months says that the Greek Cypriot 
side should reduce the funds it allocates for rearmament and 
that the foreign troops in the island should be significantly 
reduced. That resolution will be adopted by the UN Security 
Council. France and Russia are council members. Meanwhile, 
they sell arms for profit. They do not wish to effectively say 
that the Greek Cypriot side must not purchase arms, because they 
wish to make a profit. They will not say that to the Greek 
Cypriots. Meanwhile, they expect us to adopt a more flexible 
approach and agree to withdraw from this or that place or 
further demilitarize this or that area. 
  No offensive remarks should be made against the UN Security 
Council. However, what is being done will not contribute toward 
peace and reconciliation. On the contrary, it will prepare for 
war the Greek Cypriot side, which has destroyed the legal Cyprus 
Government through the use of armed force and inhuman 
activities. The Turkish Cypriots have equal rights in Cyprus. 
They have equal rights to the territory and sovereignty of 
Cyprus. The arms the Greek Cypriots acquire will be used to 
destroy the Turkish Cypriot community, which shares the 
territory and sovereignty of Cyprus. Regardless of the UN 
Security Council's support for the Greek Cypriots, we are 
expected to maintain a flexible approach. I believe that we 
have clearly informed Mr. Feissel on all that. 
  We are grieved by the existing situation. We believe that 
the United Nations has to accord equal treatment to people who 
are struggling for their freedom. We have been treated unjustly 
for 30 years. We have observed that the unjust treatment we 
have been subjected to is worsening. We regret that state of 
affairs. UN Security Council members are selling arms to Cyprus 
in order to start a war on the island. The UN principles and UN 
Security Council resolutions ban the sale of arms to any country 
in which a dispute exists. However, the most important UN 
Security Council members have been selling arms to the Greek 
Cypriots in order to make a profit, regardless of the dispute 
between the two communities. I believe that neither history nor 
humanity will forgive that. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Text" of "exclusive" interview with Turkish Cypriot </F>
community leader Rauf Denktas by Gul Demir and Niki Gamm in 
Istanbul; date not given] 
  [Text] [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] -- Would you describe your 
reactions to the Butrus-Ghali report last week? Are you 
satisfied with the actions being taken by the United Nations 
Secretary General and his staff or do you think it would be 
better if some mechanism could be found for the Greek and the 
Turkish Cypriot sides to talk together without being compelled 
or threatened? 
  [Denktas] "Frustration" I think is the word!.. We had worked 
hard with the representative of the Secretary-General until 
23.00 hours on 31 May 1994 and gave our views to him in writing. 
We had said "yes" to almost everything and yet, next day, in 
spite of the seven hours' difference between New York and 
Cyprus, the effort of 31 May was not even referred to by the 
Secretary-General, whose report was dated 30 May. He did not 
think it necessary to put a new paragraph in his report and thus 
inform the Security Council of the latest developments. We have 
now requested the Secretary-General to make a second report and 
give the Security Council a full picture of the latest position. 
(Yesterday the Secretary-General announced that he would submit 
a supplementary report to the Security Council which outlines 
the further progress made towards a settlement to the Cyprus 
problem.) 
  The report has created great uproar amongst the Turkish 
people, both in Turkey and in the TRNC [Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus]. This is not helpful for the negotiations. 
Loss of confidence between the parties to the conflict and the 
secretariat should be avoided. 
  The Secretary General has proposed that a new way be found 
for tackling the problem. I would say that what we need is a 
new diagnosis of the problem. The problem arose in 1963 when 
the Greek Cypriot partner in the Partnership Republic tried to 
convert a bicommunal republic into a Greek Cypriot Republic. 
The problem became utterly intractable when the Security 
Council, in its wisdom, treated the wrongdoer as the legitimate 
government of Cyprus. The problem has not been solved for 30 
years because Greek Cypriot preference is to keep the title of 
"the government of Cyprus" and reap the political and monetary 
benefits which go with this title... As the Turkish Cypriot 
partner refuses to recognize the Greek Cypriot pretence to be 
the government of Cyprus the problem drags on... 
  Under the 1960 Agreements and the Constitution of the island 
one community cannot rule the other nor can any one community 
claim to be the government of the whole island... but for the 
recognition afforded to the Greek Cypriot regime by the Security 
Council, the pretenders to power in Cyprus, would by now be 
facing charges for offenses against humanity before an 
international Court of Justice. 
  I have asked for direct talks with Mr. Kliridhis but he 
refuses to meet me, saying that if he meets me his status will 
be lowered or mine be elevated to his status... Fear of losing 
what he knows is not his prevents him from talking to me face to 
face. 
  [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] You have been quoted in the Turkish 
press within the last two weeks as saying that: you believe it 
is time to consider some form of union with Turkey; it might be 
a good idea to sign an agreement with the Greek Cypriots 
pledging not to attack each other; and you are willing to 
continue talking about the Confidence Building Measures 
including those aspects which were agreed upon during the Vienna 
meetings. Would you comment on these please? 
  [Denktas] The Greek Cypriot application for admission to the 
European Union (EU) as "Cyprus" is an unacceptable, legally void 
act... By this act the Greek Cypriot side is trying to integrate 
with Greece via the EU! This is contrary to the Treaty of 
Establishment. 
  This act is contrary to the principles of modern democracy. 
In Cyprus, even under the 1960 Constitution the two communities 
elected their representatives separately. Legitimacy in the 
Executive and in Parliament arose when the democratically 
elected representatives of the two communities took up office 
jointly! In his December 1963 coup, Makarios aimed to destroy 
the democratic institutions of the Turkish Cypriot partner but 
failed to do so. Turkish Cypriots continued to rule themselves 
through their democratically elected representatives even after 
the destruction of the 1960 Republic... That is why the Greek 
Cypriot leaders cannot represent the whole population of the 
island... The Secretary-General, fully aware of this situation, 
ruled that any application for EU membership should be through 
separate referenda of the two communities. 
  In spite of all this, the EU is encouraging the Greek 
Cypriots to believe that their acceptance "as Cyprus" to EU 
membership is a matter of months. If this process continues and 
we see a real danger that it will materialize then we have to 
make a counter move in order to avoid one sided integration with 
Greece... We have to find ways and means of integrating with 
Turkey. "What is good for the goose should be good for the 
gander" is a good saying!... 
  Look at what the Greek Cypriots are doing vis-a-vis Greece. 
Defense agreements; giving sea and air bases to Greece; 
agreement to speak with one voice on Cyprus; social, educational 
economic agreements with Greece. 
  All these are between the Greek Cypriots and Greece... and 
all, for the advancement of the national "cause." All these in 
complete disregard of the views, feelings and rights of Turkish 
Cypriot side!... If we do not plan a counter action we shall be 
wiped off the map of Cyprus like the Cretan Turks in the 
1900s!... We have to take counter action in self-defense... We 
shall integrate with Turkey in line with Greek Cypriot 
integration with Greece... There is no other way. We do not 
want to be colonized by Greece and the Greek Cypriots have no 
right to pull us into the EU when economically and politically 
we are not ready for it!... We have our democratic institutions 
able to express the political will of our people on such 
matters. But we have not even been asked our views by the 
so-called Government of Cyprus. 
  If the EU wants a settlement in Cyprus it should tell the 
Greek Cypriot leaders that they have no right to apply for EU 
membership in the absence of a separate mandate from the Turkish 
side!... 
  I have repeatedly invited the Greek Cypriot leaders to sign 
a 
non-aggression agreement with us so that people on both sides 
relax and peace initiatives are given a better chance... I 
invited Kiprianou, Vasiliou and now Kliridhis... Each time their 
answer has been the same: if they sign such an agreement with 
us, this will be tantamount to recognition!... But my 
initiatives are on a communal basis. I say let us sign these 
agreements as community leaders and let us put a clear clause 
with them that such agreements in no way mean recognition for 
either party... Their answer is the same... The fear of losing 
the "title" of the government of Cyprus is too deep in their 
hearts... They know that they have no legitimate right to 
present themselves as "the Government of Cyprus" and they fear 
that the smallest mistake may cause this false title to slide 
away from them!... 
  The Vienna accord has to be part and parcel of the 21 March 
paper... If so, we are ready to start negotiating on this 
paper... 
  [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] The Greek Cypriots have been arming 
themselves ever further and a Jane's Defense Weekly article has 
just appeared in which it is written that they spent over 500 
million dollars this past year on arms which included offensive 
weapons. Would you comment on this? What about the report over 
the weekend in Turkey that the Greek Cypriots and the Greeks 
have, at least for the time being, abandoned the idea of signing 
a mutual defense pact? 
  [Denktas] The purchase of arms is in its fourth year. 
Countries which are permanent members of the Security Council 
keep on selling arms to what they consider to be "the Government 
of Cyprus" while the Security Council calls upon the two sides 
not to do anything which might exacerbate the situation!... Each 
day Greek Cypriot leaders tell us why they are arming! They will 
carry the Greek flag to the north! How can anyone talk of a new 
partnership government with these people when such war cries go 
on. 
  If the Security Council does not review the facts of Cyprus 
and does not have a look at the Rule of Law, this dangerous 
trend will continue and the Greek Cypriot attempt to convert 
Cyprus into a Greek island will not stop... That has to stop if 
the two sides are to be good neighbors in the future. The news 
item that the Greek Cypriots and Greece have abandoned the idea 
of signing an initial defense pact for the time being is no 
comfort to us. Greek generals come and go to south Cyprus for 
the implementation of this agreement. Greece is clandestinely 
sending 90 renovated tanks to Cyprus under this agreement. 
Search and preparation for air and sea bases continue 
unhindered... Are all these compatible with what the 
Secretary-General is trying to do in Cyprus? Of course not!... 
But the "good Greeks" are never censured for these misdeeds. 
  [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] There have been two shooting 
incidents at Lefka in which shots were fired at Turkish 
positions from the Greek Cypriot side. At the same time two 
Turks who were in southern Cyprus were killed last week. Has 
any explanation of either incident been forthcoming from the 
Greek Cypriots (as opposed to what has been written in their 
newspapers)? Do you think these were ill-considered attempts to 
provoke the northern side into reaction? 
  [Denktas] Hardly 300 Turkish Cypriots live in the south. 
Twenty-two of them have recently been severely beaten and forced 
to walk over to the north under threats of being shot. A few 
days ago, masked Greek Cypriots brutally killed two Turkish 
Cypriots living with them in the south.. And border 
disturbances, firing shots at random are becoming more and more 
"popular pastimes" on the Greek Cypriot side... "The best Turk 
is a dead Turk" is a popular saying amongst Greek Cypriot 
youth!.. 
  [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] Is there anything NATO can do to bring 
about a just settlement to the Cyprus problem? Or would it be 
better if that organization didn't become involved at all? 
  [Denktas] This is the shape of things... and these are the 
difficulties which confront us and perfectly frustrate the 
Secretary-General... But I am adamant in my view that what 
prevents a settlement is the treatment of the Greek Cypriot side 
as the legitimate government of Cyprus. 
  Some authority has to tell the Greek Cypriot side that this 
title does not given them any authority over the Turkish Cypriot 
partner of the defunct State who now live in the North under 
their own democratic regime... The way to a settlement is to 
talk face to face and seek a solution which will be just, viable 
and permanent. Mr. Hugo Gobbi, the former Special 
Representative of the Secretary- General in Cyprus, has just 
written a pamphlet under the eye-opening title of "Rethinking 
Cyprus." Mr. Gobbi loves Cyprus and has good friends in North 
and South. He writes passionately from his experience and 
points out the way to peace. His recipe is short and sound. 
"Land for recognition and cooperation as good neighbors" is 
what he says. The rest should be left to time, to evolution.

<F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "A Made Decision"] </F>
  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis' decision to resign if 
the British and Americans pressure the UN Security Council and 
the UN secretary general to continue the process of the 
so-called confidence-building measures should not be 
misinterpreted by the Foreign Office and the State Department. 
  The Cyprus Government cannot threaten. However, it has the 
right to protest and warn against the consequences of the 
criminal policy being followed by the governments of the two 
countries. 
  The confidence-building measures are dead, even if Hurd, 
Christopher, and Cetin do not want to accept this reality. Our 
side's appraisal of the confidence-building measures is also 
supported by the secretary general, his representatives, and 
even by members of the Security Council. It is only the United 
States and Britain who do not want to be convinced and are 
actually plotting to undermine the Government of the Republic of 
Cyprus, which they allegedly recognize, to satisfy the desires 
of Ankara. 
  The press reports that the contents of Kliridhis' letters 
was 
leaked out by the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia prove the coarse 
policy that Washington wants to impose. However, it must have 
realized that the decision to terminate the confidence-building 
measures has already been made. No substantial results will be 
achieved by the scandalous and provocative U.S. and British 
behavior to drag us once again into procedures that have served 
the Turkish side's intransigent tactics and filibustering.

  [Excerpts] The initial results of yesterday's European 
Parliament elections constitute a double message and a double 
shock for the government of PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement] and New Democracy, with very serious consequences for 
the official opposition party. Election results show a 
significant increase for the Political Spring party, a greater 
proportional increase for the Coalition of the Left and 
Progress, and a sizable increase for KKE [Greek Communist Party] 
and DIANA [Democratic Renewal]. 
  The initial consequences may be a corrective shift toward 
the 
governing party, and a serious reaction to the leadership's 
policy toward New Democracy. 
  The elections for the European Parliament show that it was 
affected more by the domestic situation and the country's 
internal problems than from the European aspect of the 
elections. [passage omitted] 
  The two largest parties fared just under the level of the 
previous elections for the European Parliament but the 
significant increase of Political Spring confirms the split in 
the conservative faction. 
  At the same time, the Coalition of the Left and Progress and 
KKE showed that they tended toward their traditional overall 
level. 
  Yesterday's elections also gives a message about the 
upcoming 
presidential election in May 1995. The message is that the lack 
a presidential majority cannot be ruled out, something that will 
lead to new general elections. [passage omitted]

We will not recognize a state that has the term `Macedonia' in 
its name. Furthermore, a condition for the lifting of the 
embargo is a change of Skopje's flag, either by amending the 
constitution, or having Skopje submit a binding peaceful 
declaration to the United Nations. It should confirm at the 
first opportunity that it will take the necessary steps in 
parliament to change the relevant articles of its constitution.

  [Text] On 9 June, Amnesty International asked the Albanian 
attorney general for explanations of the arrests and 
interrogations of six members of the Greek minority organization 
Omonoia. The arrested people have been detained in Tirana 
prisons for the past two months. 
  The international human rights organization is demanding to 
know whether the six detainees had lawyers during the entire 
period of their interrogation, particularly during the 
questioning by interrogators. 
  According to Amnesty International, during the month of May 
only one of the six detainees was visited by a lawyer, and no 
lawyer was present during questioning. Finally, Amnesty 
International expressed concern over reports it received that 
when the six people were arrested the police searched the 
Omonoia offices and houses of members of the Greek minority in 
Gjirokaster, Delvine, and Sarande without search warrants. 
There have also been reports that members of the Greek minority 
were threatened by the police during interrogation about 
possible contacts with these six arrested people.

<F P=106> [Report by Stavros Liyeros] </F>
  [Text] Even the fever of the last days before the European 
elections was not capable of changing the plans for the 
government reshuffle that is expected in early July. Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou intends to stay in Corfu for a few 
day after the end of the European Union [EU] summit to make his 
final decisions about the new cabinet away from intense pressure 
from those who want a promotion, those who merely want to stay, 
and of course those who will do anything to get a portfolio. 
  Despite his initial intention to make broad changes, 
Papandreou has made up his mind to enact what he calls a 
selective reshuffle. Although it is understood that this will 
be finalized in the next two days, the issue has concerned the 
prime minister for a long time as he has been considering some 
alternatives. According to existing information from all 
available sources, the plans that are being formulated--at least 
for now--for each ministry are as follows: 

  -  The plan that 
Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis and Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias will "exchange" their portfolios does not seem very 
probable, although it has not been ruled out because the prime 
minister came up with the idea when he was forming the current 
cabinet. Papoulias wants to remain at the Foreign Ministry and 
will possibly succeed, since Arsenis appears to prefer the 
Defense Ministry, at least during this sensitive period in 
interparty balance. 
  -  It is considered definite that Alternate 
Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos will abandon his current 
position. In his recent meeting with the prime minister, the 
two men "agreed" that a moratorium is necessary, something that 
will possibly mean that Pangalos will receive another 
ministerial portfolio. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos 
would like this portfolio. Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios 
Papandreou could be appointed to the position, as he has also 
expressed interest in the position of EU commissioner. 
  -  If 
Minister to the Prime Minister Anastasios Peponis is transferred 
from his position, Venizelos will pursue the position because he 
would like to move from being a deputy minister to a ministerial 
position. The Thessaloniki deputy believes that he has done 
everything he could in his current position, especially 
regarding promotion. The possibility of being transferred are 
few because Papandreou has no immediate alternate solution and 
he is not concerned that his deputy might be politically 
damaged. 
  -  The big question is who will fill the gap at the 
Interior Ministry? Because Interior Minister Akis 
Tsokhatzopoulos is being forced to abandon his portfolio, he 
will try to have his close associate Deputy Interior Minister 
Yeoryios Dhaskalakis become his successor. However, the prime 
minister opposes this solution. Aegean Minister Konstandinos 
Skandhalidhis wants to be transferred to it, but after the 
reaction of the PASOK secretary general and other senior party 
members, he has halted his candidacy. Of course, this does not 
mean that Papandreou will not choose him. Another solution would 
be to transfer Finance Minister Alexandros Papadhopoulos because 
he is knowledgeable on Interior Ministry issues. 

  The problem is that the prime minister considers him 
essential to the Finance Ministry during this critical period. 
The possibility that Peponis will take over the controversial 
ministry is strong. Rokofillos also wants to take over the 
ministry and is pressing Papandreou to give him a portfolio. 
The advantage of the three men mentioned is that they cannot 
exploit this portfolio for personal gains, something that makes 
them acceptable. This is why it appears that there is no 
possibility that Venizelos will be given the 
position. 

  -  National Economy Minister Ioannis Papandoniou and 
Alternate National Economy Minister Yeoryios Romeos appear to be 
secure in their positions. The prime minister believes that 
Papandoniou, who was recently promoted, must be given more time. 
Anomeritis may be appointed in a deputy minister position at 
the Finance or National Economy Ministries. 
  -  Industry and 
Commerce Minister Konstandinos Simitis would want to keep both 
of his portfolios if he is not transferred to the Education 
Ministry. If he is, Pangalos would most likely take over the 
Industry Ministry and Vaso Papandreou would take over the 
Ministry of Commerce. Deputy Commerce Minister Alexandros 
Paltas will possibly be removed. 
  -  There is contradictory 
information on whether Agriculture Minister Yeoryios Moraitis 
and Deputy Agriculture Minister Floros Konstandinou will stay in 
their positions. One of them will possibly be removed while 
there is a serious possibility that Larissa deputy Adhamopoulos 
will take over as deputy agriculture minister in charge of 
forests. It is not likely that Pottakis will be given a 
portfolio, but he cannot be ruled out. There is also the 
possibility that the ministry will be given to 
Pangalos. 
  -  Everything indicates that Labor Minister Evangelos 
Yiannopoulos will be removed from the government. The prime 
minister was very troubled about making this decision. However, 
the possibility that he will be dismissed even before the 
reshuffling cannot be ruled out. The candidates to fill this 
gap are Vaso Papandreou and Tzoumakas. Deputy Labor Minister 
Andonios Kotsakas, a member of the Executive Bureau, will remain 
in the government. 
  -  Environment Minister Konstandinos Laliotis 
will remain in his position but the possibility of dividing the 
ministry to create a Public Works Ministry is being considered. 
Deputy Public Order Minister Konstandinos Yitonas will take 
over the new ministry. If the Environment Ministry is not 
divided, the current deputy public order minister will take over 
the position of Alternate Environment Minister Ioannis 
Souladhakis, who will certainly be replaced. Deputy Environment 
Minister Elisavet Papazoi will remain in her position or will be 
used in the new cabinet. 
  -  In the likely event that Transport 
Minister Ioannis Kharalambous is removed, the ministry may be 
given to Pangalos or Deputy Transport Minister Athanasios 
Tsouras, who is primarily pursuing the PASOK candidacy for 
Athens mayor in the next municipal elections to be held in 
October 1994. 
  -  Health Minister Dhimitrios Kremastinos will keep 
his ministry while Farmakis' appointment as deputy health 
minister is being discussed. Although the thought of upgrading 
the Social Security Department to a separate ministry has lost 
ground, it has not been completely abandoned. At one time the 
prime minister considered appointing Dhimitrios Tsovolas to head 
the new ministry, but the climate has changed now. 
  -  Education 
Minister Dhimitrios Fatouros will be removed from his position 
while Deputy Education Minister Eleni Stefanou will remain in 
her position. Tsatsos supports Stefanou. Simitis and Pangalos 
are being considered for the ministerial position. 
  -  It does not 
seem that Culture Minister Athanasios Mikroutsikos will be 
replaced at the Culture Ministry, but it is likely that a deputy 
minister will be appointed. According to unconfirmed 
information, Sifounakis' is being considered for this 
position. 
  -  Justice Minister Yeoryios Kouvelakis will most 
certainly remain in his position because he is considered 
irreplaceable at the Justice Ministry. He has received praise 
in that position. 
  -  The fact that some government circles managed 
to make the issue of nightclub operating hours a major political 
issue created the possibility for the removal of Public Order 
Minister Stilianos Papathemelis, even though he is considered 
successful. Bandouvas will possibly replace 
him. 
  -  Macedonia-Thraki Minister Konstandinos Triaridhis is not in 
danger of losing his position, even though some people want to 
see others in this ministry. Papandreou regards him favorably 
and has the support of the always strong Deputy Minister to the 
Prime Minister Andonios Livanis. 
  -  Aegean Minister Konstandinos 
Skandhalidhis will keep his portfolio if he is not selected for 
the Interior Ministry.

<F P=106> [Report by Ioannis Loulis] </F>
  [Excerpts] The well-known public opinion poll "Trends" by 
the MRB organization, in view of the elections for the European 
Parliament, presents some particularly interesting findings on 
the current political climate in Greece. The poll, which was 
conducted from 14 to 24 May, had a sample of 2,000 voters and is 
carried out every six months. 
  The main findings of the report, which included specific 
questions from Sky radio and I KATHIMERINI, are the following: 
  First: Regarding voter preferences, the poll does not add 
anything new since it was carried out before the campaign 
reached its climax. In comparison with previous polls, there 
appear to be more undecided voters--up to 17.1 percent--rather 
than less. According to MRB's findings, PASOK [Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement] will easily maintain its leading position, 
but New Democracy will close the gap. Political Spring will 
show a significant increase. The Coalition of the Left and 
Progress will increase its power, while the KKE [Greek Communist 
Party] will maintain its power at the current level. [passage 
omitted] 
  Second: The most substantially positive aspect of the 
government is that it is considered better than the New 
Democracy government of 1990-93. The two main answers to a 
question regarding the government's positive aspects do not 
relate to its achievements but to the "climate" it cultivates. 
According to these findings, the current government is 
considered moderate and open to dialogue by 46.4 percent and 45 
percent respectively. The government's main advantage is that 
it is considered better than the New Democracy one, with 44.3 
percent responding, and the prime minister's rating is also 
favorable, with 42.4 percent responding. The government's main 
weaknesses are that it can only convince 29.6 percent of the 
respondents that it can deal with the economic crisis, and that 
only 25.1 percent of the voters consider it credible (that it 
can do what it promised). 
  Third: The government's Achilles heel is the lack of 
confidence regarding the effectiveness of its economic policy. 
The MRB's "Trends" confirms this at many fronts: a) 31.2 
percent of the voters express great confidence in the 
government's economic policy, whereas 65.5 percent express no 
confidence; b) 7.4 percent of the voters show a positive 
judgment of the government's economic policy whereas 17 percent 
are neutral and 63.7 percent are negative. [passage omitted] 
  Fourth: New Democracy has three weaknesses, two of which 
relate to its past government of 1990-93 and one to the present. 
The party's main weakness, which hurts its credibility today, 
is the economic policy that it implemented between 1990 and 1993 
and that was mentioned by 56.1 percent of the voters asked. The 
other weakness mentioned was "economic scandals," by 52.9 
percent of those asked. Regarding the present, "serious 
internal problems" is mentioned as a weakness. On the contrary, 
the fact that only 12.2 percent mentioned [New Democracy 
Chairman] Miltiadhis Evert as a "problem" and only 20.1 percent 
said that the party does not have capable officials to govern, 
shows that Evert and his officials are the party's "winning 
cards." 
  Fifth: The fact that [Prime Minister and PASOK Chairman] 
Andreas Papandreou and Evert are the "winning cards" of their 
parties is also indicated by their popularity. Coalition of the 
Left and Progress Chairman Nikolaos Konstandopoulos has a lot of 
friends and the difference between his positive and negative 
ratings is 27.8 percent on the positive side. Evert has a 
positive differential of 8.4 percent and Papandreou a 4.2 
percent positive differential. Regarding [Political Spring 
Chairman] Andonios Samaras, the negative opinions prevail 
slightly by 2.9 percent. Whereas KKE Secretary General Aleka 
Papariga has a negative differential of 35.8 percent. [passage 
omitted] 
  Sixth: The most positive finding for New Democracy is the 
feeling that a government with Evert as prime minister would 
possibly be better than the current government. This view 
confirms earlier MRB findings in Athens and now is confirmed 
throughout the country. Specifically, 31.4 percent believe that 
a government under Evert would be better than the current [under 
Papandreou], 29.3 percent said it would be worse, and 27.9 
percent consider that it would be the "same." At the same 
time, 37 percent of voters consider the current government 
better that the previous one under New Democracy, 32.3 percent 
consider it the "same," and only 28.7 percent consider it worse. 
[passage omitted] 
  Seventh: Papandreou's succession is the issue that appears 
to be the source of instability for PASOK. In the first poll 
after the death of Yeoryios Yennimatas--who was thought to be 
the most appropriate to succeed Papandreou--four candidates 
prevailed. Specifically, among PASOK supporters the order is 
the following: [Former European Union Commissioner and 
currently deputy] Vaso Papandreou 14.7 percent, [Industry 
Minister] Konstandinos Simitis 13 percent, [Alternate Foreign 
Minister on European Union affairs] Theodhoros Pangalos 12.1 
percent, and [National Defense Minister] Yerasimos Arsenis 11.2 
percent. Dhimitrios Tsovolas and Akis Tzokhatzopoulos follow 
clearly behind with 8.7 percent and 7 percent respectively. 
What appears as evidence of instability for PASOK, beyond the 
fact that no one or two candidates to "succeed" Papandreou 
prevailed, is that the most probable successor--especially among 
PASOK voters--is Tzokhatzopoulos, even though he received a low 
percentage as the most suitable in the successor category. 
Apparently, PASOK voters consider Tzokhatzopoulos as the most 
probable successor to Papandreou with 24.5 percent, followed by 
Arsenis with 11.8 percent. On the contrary, Vaso Papandreou, 
Simitis and Pangalos, who are considered as the most suitable 
with high percentages, received only 4.9 percent, 8.6 percent 
and 7.1 percent respectively. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "The Messages"] </F>
  [Text] Whatever the interpretations given by PASOK 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement] and New Democracy to explain 
the significant decrease of their electoral support over the 
last eight months, one thing is certain: The electorate sent, 
via the election, a clear message to the two big parties that 
alternate in the government. 
  PASOK lost a significant part of its support and should deal 
with it, even if the voter's attitude is different in the 
elections for the European Parliament. There are many reasons 
that the voters looked elsewhere and did not vote for PASOK 
again. The main reason is PASOK's economic policy. 
  Therefore, the following question is raised: Will PASOK 
change its policy, and if so, how? Will it implement the same, 
or a more correct program with greater consistency and 
determination, or will it hand out benefits in order to regain 
its lost ground? 
  Seeing the problem from a wider spectrum, Acting Foreign 
Minister Theodhoros Pangalos acknowledged, while commenting on 
the election result, the government should not ignore the 
message it has received. He stressed that the government should 
continue implementing its policy in accordance with its 
preelection program. "We did not promise benefits," he said, 
and stressed: "We should implement our program with 
consistency." 
  The message to New Democracy, whose leaders did not manage 
to 
prevent a further decrease in the party's support, is of another 
kind. It is a message that will create a very serious problem 
for [New Democracy Chairman] Miltiadhis Evert. 
  New Democracy lost support, mainly to Political Spring, 
which 
has doubled its support in eight months. Political Spring has 
thus become an accountable factor not only in in terms of the 
opposition, but in the country's political landscape because of 
its role in the presidential election. That will determine 
whether or not the country will go to general elections in May 
1995. Probably, Political Spring will chose the former in 
order to increase its support. 
  The ballot also sent a message of optimism to the smaller 
parties whose approval ratings increased. The electorate wants 
the presence of small political parties. Yesterday's vote for 
the small parties was not merely a vote of sympathy or temporary 
support to prevent their disappearance. Of course the small 
parties should utilize the voters' support and react properly. 
  The government and political parties should carefully 
analyze 
the election results and not undermine the value of messages 
that came out of the ballots.

<F P=106> [The "Views" column: "Toward Dialogue"] </F>
  [Text] What would the prerequisites be for a meeting 
between Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Turkish Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller, when it appears to be prepared with the 
Greek side showing "goodwill" and the Turkish side continuing 
its provocations and intransigence? 
  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said that a meeting 
"would 
be desirable only if it would create a good climate." But could 
this good climate be created given the U.S. position, which is 
openly in support of Turkey as can be seen from the 
"recommendations" made only to Greece? 
  Could obedience to "suggestions" and "recommendations" lead 
to subjection and an outcome that would be against us on 
critical national issues? 
  According to accurate ELEVTHEROTIPIA information, the 
"recommendations" toward Greece are: a) to show "goodwill," 
understanding, and moderation in the approach to Turkey by 
putting aside the Cyprus issue, b) to show generosity toward 
Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] as a 
strong power in the Balkans and c) not to consider the United 
States an alternative for solutions on which we can depend, 
given that we belong to the European Union [EU]. 
  Interpreting and complying with these "recommendations" 
cannot bring results favorable to the national interest. 
Unless--as we stressed yesterday--Papandreou is aware of things 
that other Greeks--people, parties, and press--do not know about. 
  But, is it correct and nationally useful not to be aware of 
what is being played--if it is being played--under the table? 
Where can secret diplomacy, which Papandreou criticized when he 
was in the opposition, lead? 
  The facts of the public aspects of our national issues, as 
well as recent Turkish provocation--with U.S. encouragement--do 
not allow for any reasonable optimism. 
  On the contrary, they raise a number of concerned questions 
about what may happen if we get involved in "goodwill" moves, 
which will essentially mean subjection, after following the 
recommendations. Therefore, open answers and open diplomacy are 
needed because citizens have a right to know.

  [Text] Ankara, June 14, IRNA -- Visiting Iranian Interior 
Minister 'Ali Mohammad Besharati discussed Tehran-Ankara 
cooperation in his separate meetings with Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller and Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin Monday [13 June]. In 
his meeting with Ciller, Besharati said that there was no 
problem in the relations of the two countries in the security, 
political and economic fields. He said that occasional 
misunderstandings which sometimes surface between the two 
countries are natural between two neighboring countries, adding 
that they can be removed through constant bilateral talks. 
  Besharati said that Iran's foreign policy is based on 
non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and 
that Tehran's ties with Turkey are based on good neighborly and 
friendly relations. Tehran-Ankara cooperation in campaign 
against terrorism was a positive result of the constant meetings 
between Iranian and Turkish officials he said and voiced concern 
over the activities of certain opponents of the Islamic Republic 
in Turkey. 
  Referring to damages inflicted from the bombardment of 
Iranian border areas by Turkish fighters, he called on Turkey to 
compensate the losses. Turkish fighters bombarded two Iranian 
border villages in the outskirts of the northeastern city of Sar 
Dasht on January 28 during which two people were killed. 
  Besharati also called on Turkey to introduce the members of 
the parliamentary friendship committee and the joint trade and 
economic commission saying that the Iranian members were already 
nominated. 
  Ciller expressed regret over the losses inflicted as a 
result 
of the air raid on the Iranian border areas and said that 
experts are investigating the issue. She added that strict 
instructions have been given to the Turkish interior minister 
and the governors general to prevent the activities of the 
anti-Iranian elements. 
  Turning to regional issues, Ciller stressed preservation of 
the territorial integrity of Iraq, and added that regional 
countries would face problems if the Iraqi problem is not 
settled. 
  In his meeting with Foreign Minister Cetin, Besharati 
discussed bilateral cooperation in security, political, 
economic, and parliamentary fields. 
  In an interview before the meeting, Besharati said that 
constant talks and contacts between the two countries' officials 
helped maintain peace and stability in the region. Expressing 
satisfaction over the prevailing tranquility in the region, he 
said that Iran and Turkish officials preferred long-term 
interests to the short-term ones. 
  Stressing that enemies of Turkey had no base or place in 
Iranian territory, the interior minister said that Tehran was 
aware of Turkish problems and considered Ankara's enemies as its 
own enemies. 
  Turning to the forthcoming tripartite meeting of the foreign 
ministers of Iran, Turkey and Syria to be held in Damascus next 
month, he said that follow-up of the developments in northern 
Iraq will be among important topics of the meeting's agenda. He 
said that the forthcoming visit to Tehran of Turkish President 
Suleiman Demirel will be another important stride towards 
consolidating bilateral ties. 
  In a speech, Cetin mentioned Iran and Turkey as the two 
great 
countries of the region and said that expansion of friendly and 
brotherly ties between the two countries has important impact on 
the establishment of peace and stability in the region. 
Referring to the constructive role of the exchange of visits 
between the ranking officials of the two countries, Cetin said 
that the commission on security cooperation is continuing its 
talks at the highest level. 
  Meanwhile, the Iran-Turkey joint security commission Monday 
afternoon held a session at experts level chaired by the deputy 
interior ministers of the two counties. The participants 
assessed security issues to prepare a protocol to be signed by 
the interior ministers of the two countries. The commission 
also discussed Tehran-Ankara cooperation in the field of 
campaign against narcotics.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has received Iranian 
Interior Minister 'Ali Mohammad Besharati-Jahromi, who is in 
Turkey on an official visit. Murat Karayalcin, state minister 
and deputy prime minister, and Interior Minister Nahit Mentese 
were also present at the meeting. Ambassador Volkan Vural, the 
prime minister's adviser, said in a statement to reporters that 
during the meeting Ciller stressed the importance Turkey 
attaches to its friendship and cooperation with Iran. Vural 
said: At the meeting, Besharati reiterated that Iran will never 
allow activities against Turkey to take place on its territory. 
He added that the issues of joint operations and an exchange of 
terrorists were not discussed at the Ciller-Besharati meeting. 
  Besharati later called on Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. At 
the meeting, Cetin said that the good relations between the two 
friendly and neighborly countries greatly contribute to regional 
stability. Cetin added that the good bilateral relations will be 
further strengthened through high-level dialogues. Besharati 
said that no group will be allowed to engage in activities 
against Turkey on Iranian territory. He added that President 
Suleyman Demirel's visit to Tehran next month will be an 
important step in bilateral relations. Mentese was also present 
at the Cetin-Besharati meeting. 
  Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Cetin, 
Besharati 
said that Turkey and Iran share the view that the disruption of 
Iraq's territorial integrity will endanger regional stability. 
Replying to correspondents' questions, Mentese said that there 
are no border disputes between Iran and Turkey and that the 
issue of border security was discussed. In reply to a question 
on whether Besharati was informed of Turkey's expectations 
regarding border security, Mentese said: We have jointly 
included the issue of PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terror on 
the agenda. We are discussing the issue. Iran has also 
accepted that the PKK is a terror organization. In any event, 
Iran agrees that there is no Kurdish problem in Turkey and that 
the PKK is a terror organization.

  [Text] Istanbul, June 10 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin said on Friday [10 June] that the Netherlands struggled 
against terrorism within its legal framework adding that it 
tried to prevent terrorism activities. 
  Cetin met Dutch Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans during the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council meetings and said Dutch laws 
did not ban an organization or an association which is not 
directly involved in a violation. 
  `Kooijmans conveyed that they are obviously taking 
additional 
measures and they struggle with possible terrorism activities 
that could come from other sides of Europe,' Cetin said. 
  `Kooijmans said there were reported ones who are under 
custody and some of them were extradited. They stressed 
importance to preventing terrorism activities rather than 
banning,' he added. 
  Cetin said European friends and allies should give support 
to 
Turkey on terrorism adding that giving this support is an 
international obligation. 
  He also said they discussed developments in the European 
Union [EU] and Turkish-EU relations.

relations. 
  In reply to a question on whether he will discuss the 
extension of the Poised Hammer mandate with U.S. officials, 
Yilmaz said: 
  [Begin Yilmaz recording] The question of whether the Poised 
Hammer mandate will be extended depends on the decision of the 
Turkish Grand National Assembly. The importance the U.S. 
Administration attaches to this issue is evident, and if U.S. 
officials raise the subject, I will convey our views to them. 
[end recording] 
  Yilmaz remarked that on 20 June, he will hold a news 
conference on his contacts in the United States, and he will 
return to Turkey the following day.

<F P=106> [Article by Mehmet Ali Birand: "Turkey Must Reject the U.S. </F>
Military Aid Package"] 
  [Text] It is impossible for anyone not to realize what lies 
in the future for Ankara if they contact the members of the U.S. 
Congressional committees concerned with matters related to 
Turkey and their aides, who determine the way the committee 
members should vote. The U.S. Congress has placed the Kurdish 
problem on its agenda because of our exaggerated behavior and 
the anti-Turkish lobby's influence. In fact, it seems reluctant 
to exclude it from its agenda. Obviously, it intends to 
intensify pressure on Turkey on this matter in the next few 
years. 
  Unfortunately, the U.S. Congress is unable to separate the 
Kurdish problem from the terrorist activities that are carried 
out by the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]. It regards the 
matter as a whole and believes that the terrorist activities are 
related to "the uprising of a miserable people who have been 
oppressed for many years, in pursuit of their natural rights and 
their cultural identity." The approach of the U.S. Congress to 
the Kurds in Turkey is similar to its sympathetic approach to 
the Kurds in northern Iraq because it is unable to see the 
difference between the two peoples. That is why there is 
confusion on the matter. Tomatoes and potatoes are being 
confused. However, Turkey has suffered as a result of that 
approach. 
  The atmosphere in the U.S. Congress is changing, so much so 
that Turkey may in the future face several resolutions that will 
completely suspend the military aid programs and ban the use of 
U.S. arms in southeastern Turkey. These developments are 
serious. Therefore, we must seriously assess the indications and 
reconsider Turkey's basic policies. 
<H5>  The Administration Shares Congress' Criticism... </H5>
  One of Turkey's basic policies, which should be 
reconsidered, 
is related to the U.S. military aid program. It is common 
knowledge that the U.S. House of Representatives linked 25 
percent of the $453 million the Clinton Administration has 
earmarked for Turkey to the Kurdish problem, the progress Turkey 
achieves on human rights, and the reports the U.S. State 
Department and the Pentagon will submit in that regard. That 
means that Turkey will make progress on the Kurdish problem and 
the question of human rights, and the U.S. Departments of State 
and Defense will submit reports to Congress to confirm it. In 
other words, the U.S. military aid program has been linked to 
the Kurdish problem and the developments in southeastern Turkey. 
Apparently a mechanism has been established that cannot be 
stopped but which can be intensified and broadened very easily. 
It is common knowledge that 25 percent of the aid program has 
been suspended. Another half of that program may be suspended 
in the near future. In fact, the whole program may be 
completely suspended. No one should doubt that. 
  From 1974 to 1976 Congress linked its aid program to the 
Cyprus problem. In fact, it went as far as to impose an arms 
embargo on Turkey at that time. Nevertheless, the embargo was 
lifted after a short time because the U.S. Administration 
opposed it and supported Turkey's struggle to change Congress' 
mind. 
  However, that situation is different now. On the contrary, 
the Clinton Administration has encouraged the U.S. Congress. It 
is true that it does not wish to have its aid package reduced. 
However, it supports every statement that is made in the 
Congress on the Kurdish problem and the question of human 
rights. That includes the criticisms leveled against Turkey on 
the two matters. The U.S. Administration and Congress have a 
common approach in that regard... Meanwhile, the influence of 
Congress on the Clinton Administration must also be taken into 
consideration. That has made things even more difficult. The 
Clinton Administration clearly fears the U.S. Congress on the 
question of human rights. In fact, it is as if it has 
surrendered to Congress. It seems impossible for the U.S. 
Administration to wage a struggle against it on that matter. 
<H5>  Military Aid Will be Completely Cut... </H5>
  Congress has reduced the U.S. military aid program to Turkey 
over the course of many years. In fact, the program will be 
completely cut in a few years because it is deemed unnecessary 
after the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Furthermore, the 
economic situation in the United States requires the 
cancellation of that country's economic aid programs. That has 
already been outlined by U.S. officials. This means that the 
future of the military aid Turkey receives is not very bright. 
A time will come when no country, including Turkey, will 
receive military aid from the United States. 
  In view of all that, it is becoming more and more imperative 
for Turkey to move to reject the conditional aid package at this 
time. 
  1. Although the bill on the aid package has been approved by 
the House of Representatives, it may be turned down by the U.S. 
Senate. That is a strong possibility. Nevertheless, the link 
has been established and the House of Representatives will 
maintain it. Meanwhile, the Senate committees will debate the 
Kurdish problem in detail in the next few weeks... The 
rejection of the aid package by Turkey would remove one of the 
important trump cards in the Congress... It would be regarded 
as an important reaction. 
  2. It is understood that the aid package, which has been 
reduced to $341 million, will be further reduced to $250 
million. That will be the amount of the contribution the United 
States will make toward the F-16 project in Turkey. It will be 
in the form of a credit. However, Turkey can easily acquire an 
equal loan from the international money markets with similar 
conditions. That means that Turkey does not stand to suffer any 
material loss if it rejects the reduced aid package. 
  3. It is unthinkable that the U.S. Administration may decide 
to abandon the F-16 project. In view of that, it will 
definitely try to redeem what it contributes to the project by 
another way. 
  Turkey must reject the present form of the aid package if it 
wishes to avoid a problem in its relations with the United 
States (because each and every cut or condition creates 
tension), obstruct further pressure in the future, and avoid 
being pushed here and there by the U.S. Congress. 
<H5>  That Will Not Suffice To Resolve the Problem... </H5>
  Here is a factor we should keep in mind: Even if Turkey 
decides to reject the military aid package, it will be unable to 
rid itself of Congress if it fails to change its basic policies. 
Rejecting the aid package would be a short-term reaction. 
However, our general approach to the Kurdish problem and the 
question of human rights is very important. Ankara will be 
confronted with serious problems if the U.S. Congress moves to 
take action against Turkey because of them. 
  We felt obliged to warn against such a state of affairs. It 
is up to Turkey's leading officials to take the necessary 
measures.

<F P=106> [Column by Professor Mumtaz Soysal: "A Slap for a Slap"] </F>
  [Text] Attention should be focused on one of the sentences 
in UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's latest report so 
that the plan for Cyprus and the effort made to involve Turkey 
in it can be better understood. Following his misleading 
information and unfounded assessment of the "virtues" of the 
confidence-building measures, Butrus-Ghali stressed that several 
options can be considered for Cyprus. He said that the island 
can be abandoned to deal with its own problem, sanctions can be 
adopted, talks on the essence of the problem can be resumed, and 
the UN Security Council members can hold talks with the 
concerned sides. Butrus-Ghali noted after his so-called options 
that: "Considering the fact that the two sides have agreed in 
principle to the package of confidence-building measures, the 
international effort to reach an agreement can be resumed." 
Yes, that is the sentence that should be considered. Looking 
at the matter, an outsider may ask: "Since the hope that an 
agreement can be reached on the implementation of the package 
still exists, then why has the UN secretary general criticized 
the Turkish Cypriot side to such an extent in his report, 
particularly after Rauf Denktas made two important concessions 
at the last moment?" One of those concessions was the 
acceptance of the map on Maras [Varosha] and the other was the 
acceptance of the lifting of the Turkish Cypriot side's 
objection to that area's access road. 
  The map undermined the agreement on the "fenced area" in 
Maras and supported the Greek Cypriot demand on "municipal 
boundaries." Consequently, it allowed the Greek Cypriot side to 
acquire an additional one and a half square km of valuable land. 
However, what is more important than the value of the land the 
Greek Cypriot side has acquired was the mistake that was made in 
the negotiating process. The Turkish Cypriot side has had to 
put up with UN officials' changing approaches. 
  Butrus-Ghali initially commented on the access road as 
follows: "The Turkish Cypriot side must not worry about holding 
on to the northern part of Dhimokratias Avenue if it keeps the 
access road under its control. You may block the access road to 
paralyze Maras if necessary." That meant that the access road 
was a trump card. However, it has been given away in the Vienna 
talks. That was later confirmed in writing in Nicosia. 
  The plan was to force the Turkish Cypriot side to make 
concessions by convincing it that the UN secretary general's 
report would accuse it of maintaining an intransigent approach. 
That created a wave of fear on the Turkish Cypriot side. The 
approach was successfully applied. However, it seems that there 
is more to the matter. That state of affairs will not end as 
long as the fear exists on the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  A number of officials have expressed the view that "the 
Turkish Cypriot side was late in responding and the situation 
would have been different if Rauf Denktas had agreed earlier." 
That is meaningless. The Turkish Cypriot side would have been 
accused of maintaining an irreconcilable approach even if it had 
agreed to every demand in the hope that the promises that were 
reluctantly made to it in Vienna would be kept. 
  Nothing can be achieved through expecting the UN officials 
to 
force the Greek Cypriot side to make concessions in return for 
those made by the Turkish Cypriot side. It is common knowledge 
that talks are resumed from the point at which they are broken 
off and that the concessions made remain in effect. 
  Yes, that scenario has to end. Considering the point which 
has been reached in the Cyprus problem, the Turkish and Turkish 
Cypriot diplomats will make a very serious mistake if they agree 
to resuming the talks on the confidence-building measures. 
  Considering the "injustice" that has been done, the Turkish 
Cypriot side should not attend the talks in which more injustice 
will be done. Instead, those who have acted in an unjust way 
must be forced to regret what they have done. For example, the 
Turkish Cypriot side can inform the world that it will no longer 
"wait" for the Greek Cypriot side to agree to a reconciliation 
and move to convert several buildings in Maras, which were used 
as hotels in the past, into boarding houses for the Eastern 
Mediterranean University students. 
  Unfortunately, the new world order has given into unjust and 
tyrannical behavior. Christ said that "anyone who is slapped in 
the face should not retaliate but turn the other cheek." The 
Western countries have retained that teaching as a legend but 
have forced the other countries in the world to comply with it. 
Obviously, Turkish and Turkish Cypriot diplomacy will be 
exalted not through appreciative remarks by foreign countries 
but through reacting to an attack in a similar way.

  [Text] Vienna, June 13 (AFP) -- Two inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) were pursuing their 
mission in North Korea normally Monday [13 June], following 
early threats by Pyongyang authorities to expel them, IAEA 
spokesman David Kyd said. 
  He said the Agency had received no word from North Korean 
authorities Monday, which led IAEA officials to believe that 
"for the time being" there was no reason to think the inspectors 
would be expelled. 
  Yun Ho-chin, spokesman for Pyongyang's Vienna embassy, said 
Friday North Korea would take "adequate retaliatory measures" 
following an IAEA vote that day to suspend technical aid to 
North Korea in an escalating row over North Korea's refusal to 
meet international demands for inspection of its nuclear 
facilities. 
  Yun said that North Korea's retaliatary measures could 
include the expulsion of IAEA inspectors from North Korea, a ban 
on all verification procedures, and a possible withdrawal of 
North Korea from the IAEA and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty. 
  But Kyd said no official message had reached the IAEA 
headquarters and its two inspectors were currently observing 
8,000 spent fuel rods removed from the 5-megawatt Yongbyon 
experimental nuclear reactor. 
  The inspectors were not allowed to take samples from the 
rods. 
  The IAEA and Washington believe that Pyongyang has 
restricted 
the inspection of the reactor in order to conceal alleged 
diversion of nuclear material to an atomic weapons programme. 
  Kyd said last Friday's IAEA resolution condemning North 
Korea 
for refusing to abide by its safeguards had been forwarded to 
the UN Security Council. 
  He added that he expected the analysis of samples taken in 
May from a radio-chemical laboratory at Yongbyon to be available 
by the end of June.

<F P=106> [Report by Mats Hallgren: "`Plague Flag' for Swedish Model"] </F>
  [Text] Luxembourg -- Sweden and the Swedish welfare model 
should be a cautionary example now that the rest of Europe is to 
attempt to boost economic growth and reduce unemployment. 
  Sweden's deep crisis shows that there has to be a balance 
between the production sector of the economy and the social, 
public sector. If this balance is disturbed, as in Sweden for 
example, a country's socioeconomic system could be threatened. 
  So claims the EU's [European Union] Economic and Social 
Committee in a report which was handed over to the EU's finance 
ministers at a meeting in Luxembourg yesterday. 
  The Economic and Social Committee is one of the EU bodies to 
which proposed measures are referred for consideration and 
comprises among others representatives of employers and trade 
union organizations in the EU countries. The committee normally 
gives advice and expresses its views on new EU legislation and 
major common political initiatives. 
  In Monday's report the committee gives the views of the two 
sides of industry on the so-called white book on growth and 
employment. The white book is an attempt at a common economic 
crisis program with the aim of halving the record levels of 
unemployment in Europe by the end of the century. This crisis 
program will be one of the main points on the agenda of the EU's 
upcoming summit in Greece at the end of June. 
  In its report the committee makes special mention of 
Scandinavia and Sweden as cautionary examples. The Scandinavian 
welfare model, which has been studied and admired by all the 
industrialized countries for decades, is being reevaluated, the 
report says. There is now clear evidence here that a loss of 
balance between the productive economy and the state welfare 
system gives rise to strong negative reactions and plunges the 
whole of the socioeconomic system into crisis. 
  The report makes special mention of Sweden as an example and 
points out that Swedish unemployment, which has long been very 
low, has now risen to record levels. 
  The large public sector in Sweden is no longer able to 
absorb 
this unemployment. The weakened productive sector and the 
general recession have robbed the public sector of the necessary 
resources, the report states. 
  "We must learn the lesson from this in the EU countries. The 
conclusion is that balance must be maintained between the free 
market sector and the state sector," said Aldo Romoli, Italian 
employers' representative from the Montedison company. 
  However, it is not only the employers' side which points to 
Sweden by way of warning. The trade union representatives on 
the committee back the text of the report. 
  Klaus Schmitz, representative of the German trade union 
confederation: "The figures from Sweden speak their clear 
language. All of us in Europe want a social welfare model, with 
a productive industry and low unemployment. That is why we have 
to analyze the Swedish example and learn from the mistakes that 
have been made," he said. 
  Klaus Schmitz claimed that maintaining the balance between 
the private and public sectors is a necessity in Europe if we 
are to avoid finding ourselves with a model reminiscent of the 
United States: "There there are no concepts such as solidarity 
and social security. Their model fits in badly with our 
European values and it is a model we do not want," Klaus Schmitz 
said.

<F P=106> [Report by Norbert Mayer: "Joy, Wiener Schnitzel, and Potato </F>
Salad"] 
  [Excerpt] When the reports came in from Austria, there was 
tangible relief among the European Union [EU] diplomats. 
  EU Commission President Jacques Delors told correspondents 
that Austria is an "ideal link between East and West" and a 
"great nation" that will contribute its share to Europe, while 
maintaining its own identity. The EU motto "No more war" and 
"Unity gives strength" has been confirmed by the Austrian 
decision. The EU now needs both enlargement and a deepening of 
its institutions, Delors said. 
  Dutch Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek has 
called the result a very positive contribution. "In my opinion, 
the Union has become more European today. EU membership does 
not mean a loss of sovereignty and cultural identity but 
assuming joint responsibility." Asked by DER STANDARD whether 
he, an avid supporter of putting deepening before enlargement, 
has now changed his mind, Van den Broek said: "I have been in 
favor of enlargement not just for the past 15 months but since 
the Lisbon summit in 1992. I just wanted to make sure it will 
not water down the Union's substance and prevent a deepening." 
  Egon Klepsch, president of the European Parliament, is also 
pleased about Austria's yes vote: "The majority would not be 
deceived by the anti-EU campaign. This is a good sign for the 
progress of the ratifications in Scandinavia." 
  "If anything had gone wrong, we could only have conducted 
crisis management during our presidency in the second half of 
1994," a high-ranking representative of the German EU delegation 
said. "The Austrians have clearly voted against national 
selfish tendencies and have shown responsibility in deciding for 
a common European future," a statement by [German] Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel was quoted. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Guy Duplat: "The Danger"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels and Wallonia are now going to have to live 
with an extreme right, just like Flanders and France already 
have had to do for several years. We had thought we might be 
spared this peril, but now it is upon us. Nearly one 
French-speaking voter in 10 decided on Sunday [13 June] not just 
to show their dissatisfaction with the traditional parties, but 
also to reject the democracy which is a credit to our European 
countries. 
  That is the sad but important lesson of this European vote, 
in addition to the collapse of the PS [Walloon Socialist Party] 
and the victory of the PRL [Walloon Liberal Party]-FDF [Brussels 
French-speaking Democratic Front]. Experience abroad has shown 
us that these extremist votes cannot be eradicated in just a few 
years. They reflect a lasting malaise which requires long-term 
action by the democratic parties. 
  But let us first forcefully remind all those who wanted to 
"vent their frustration" by voting for the FN [National Front] 
or Agir [Act] that these votes will remain a surface irruption, 
without real effect. These parties will never share in the 
exercise of power and are no more than a movement of negation, a 
turning inward that offers no solution to the serious problems 
to which they are seeking to draw attention. 
  A vote for the extreme right is in fact a "cry for help." 
Very often the cry of people directly hurt by the crisis, whose 
lives are affected by insecurity, poverty, and unemployment. 
Sometimes people who believed in the solutions of the PS but 
feel let down by the scandals that have brought disgrace to the 
political class. This electorate, often inhabiting areas with a 
high immigrant population, seeks and finds a scapegoat in "them." 
  The democratic parties, those who have won today and those 
who have lost, must be careful not to console or absolve 
themselves by simply pointing to the -- real -- danger of this 
extreme right. They must attack the very roots of the evil. 
They must restore ethical values to the political debate, 
combat the pockets of poverty and exclusion that are the 
breeding ground for extremism, and take real account of the 
problems of society that were so discussed in November 1991 but 
that so often, in the interests of government budgets and state 
reform, failed to result in action. Insecurity remains a 
sensitive point. The democratic parties were wise to keep 
silent on the problem of immigration during the campaign. But 
what have they really done to support the former Royal 
Commission on Immigration, and now the Center for Equal 
Opportunity, in the struggle for the harmonious integration of 
communities which are in any event here to stay, whatever the 
dangerous harbingers of the far right may like to think? 
  The far right has now come crashing into our political 
system. The essential task for the future is to provide a 
democratic solution to the sickness which has found such 
scandalous expression.

  [Text] Bonn, June 13, IRNA -- Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Velayati delivered to Germany Chancellor Helmut Kohl here 
today a message from President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  The meeting, which took place immediately after Velayati's 
arrival in Germany, saw exchange of views on bilateral ties in 
the political, and economic and industrial spheres. 
  The two also discussed regional and international 
developments, with Velayati expressing hope that joint economic 
ventures between the two countries would further promote 
Tehran-Bonn relations. 
  Cooperation between the two sides, said Velayati, could 
serve 
as a example for other European countries. 
  Kohl thanking for Rafsanjani's message praised Iran as an 
important and influential country in the region. 
  He agreed that joint economic ventures to be pursued by Iran 
and Germany would hopefully start by the end of the current year. 
  Velayati arrived here today on an invitation from his German 
counterpart Klaus Kinkel.

  [Excerpt] The People's Party's [PP] executive committee is 
this evening analyzing the results it obtained, after having 
tasted victory. The PP has said that it will wait until the 
government reacts and draws conclusions for national policy 
after what has happened in the European elections. The PP does 
not intend at present to submit a censure motion. A news 
conference was scheduled to be held after the PP executive 
committee meeting. Antonio Criado is at PP headquarters in 
Madrid: 
  [Criado] The executive committee has been meeting for two 
hours, discussing the 12 June elections. Javier Arenas, who was 
a candidate in yesterday's elections, has just emerged and 
expressed his satisfaction at the result in Andalusia because he 
said that a political era has finally ended in Andalusia. As we 
said, this news conference has just begun. According to what 
RNE has been able to learn, the PP insists that results in the 
European elections are a clear response from the people and have 
domestic political consequences despite the European nature of 
the elections. The PP awaits the government's decision. They 
call on Felipe Gonzalez to take actions. 
  In statements to RNE, Mariano Rajoy, the PP's deputy 
secretary general, said that it would be silly for the 
government to try to carry on as normal not only by not taking 
on political responsibility but also without even knowing if it 
had sufficient support in the Congress of Deputies. He 
highlighted several scenarios ranging from a no-confidence 
motion to the calling of general elections and Felipe Gonzalez's 
resignation. Regarding the presentation of a censure motion, 
which it is up to the PP to submit, he said that he is not 
convinced by this. 
  [Begin Rajoy recording] I think that we as the party of 
opposition have to give an alternative and facilitate a way out 
of the present situation. I think that it is very difficult to 
facilitate that way out through the presentation of a censure 
motion that could have a political effect but that later in 
practical terms would come to nothing. Therefore, I don't rule 
out the presentation of that censure motion, but personally I do 
not think that it is the most correct formula to use to solve 
Spain's problems at present. [end recording] 
  [Criado] Mariano Rajoy also said that Felipe Gonzalez's 
continuation as prime minister is now no longer positive or good 
for Spain's general interests. Rajoy will give an official news 
conference tomorrow to discuss what was said during the 
executive committee meeting. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Disappointing Election"] </F>
  [Text] A turnout of over 50 percent is certainly an 
improvement on what has been up to now the low point of 46.1 
percent in 1989, but it can still be argued that there is a 
disappointingly low level of interest in the European 
Parliament. What is especially disappointing is that the no side 
was strengthened particularly at the expense of the Social 
Democrats, and this could well revive the old Social Democratic 
conflict between supporters and opponents of greater European 
cooperation. The fact that a third of votes went to opponents of 
union will underline Denmark's image as the European paradox, 
and it could also sow doubts about the Danes' wholehearted 
participation in the intergovernmental conference in 1996. 
  The day before the election both Prime Minister Poul Nyrup 
Rasmussen and Liberal Party leader Uffe Ellemann-Jensen 
predicted very optimistically that the turn out would be between 
58 and 60 percent. And it is perhaps these two men in 
particular who should take part in a face-to-face showdown to 
discover to what extent they bear part of the responsibility for 
the people's lack of interest. Were the elections to the 
European Parliament not really about domestic politics? And is 
it right that party leaders who are not running in the election 
should assume the dominant position in an election campaign that 
is not theirs? In the Folketing the party leaders leave the 
responsibility for voicing the party's views to their respective 
spokespersons, and only by way of exception do the party leaders 
step into the frontline. The same should be true of European 
politics. Leading candidates do not need stand-ins -- not even 
in nationwide television programs. The Socialist People's 
Party's John Iversen takes the view that the European Parliament 
should be closed if people do not take an interest in it. The 
problem is rather that the members of the European Parliament 
[MEP's] have been unable to give their place of work a presence 
in everyday Danish life. The 16 newly elected European 
Parliament deputies are therefore facing a major task in 
explaining why the European Parliament is worth taking an 
interest in. 
  The Social Democrats' major losses meant that the Liberal 
Party has taken over the yellow jersey of the largest party. 
But the improvement in the Liberal Party's fortunes was not as 
great as predicted. The Conservative People's Party enjoyed 
what we could call the former prime minister effect. Poul 
Schluter received a pat on the back and had a very good 
election. Lone Dybkjaer and Lilli Gyldenkilde were vote magnets 
for the Radical Liberals and the Socialist People's Party 
respectively. Meanwhile the Center Democrats had a catastrophic 
election. The Center Democrats' Peter Duetoft has the knowledge 
and the objectivity, but he lacks trenchancy. And it is true 
that the party did not benefit from the fact that Arne Melchior 
stepped in as an interim MEP right in front of the nose of Peter 
Duetoft when Erhard Jakobsen wanted to give his successor a 
further chance to create a profile for himself. The question is 
whether we have not now seen the overture to the Center 
Democrats' withdrawal from the work of both the Danish and 
European parliaments.

  [Text] Quite understandably, Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi is very happy both at the strengthening of the 
government coalition and at his personal success: he was on top 
of his party's lists in all five Italian constituencies. Let us 
listen now to the prime minister's first reaction after the 
first projections last night. He was speaking on the phone to 
RAI Uno. 
  [Begin Berlusconi recording] I think the victory will 
encourage all cabinet members to continue in the same direction 
in which we started. As far as I am concerned, I must say that 
it will encourage me to try as hard as I can and to work with 
enthusiasm and absolute commitment, since I have been rewarded 
with the approval of so many citizens. 
  As for the situation in the Senate, I hope the opposition 
will learn from what happened and that they will want to be in 
opposition in a positive way. The opposition is comprised of 
several groups today -- I clearly mean the Italian Popular Party 
-- which should think about these results and about their 
behavior. This would lead them, I believe, to get more in touch 
with their electorate, that is, people who want to remain among 
the moderates and want to support the government. [end

  [Text] Athens (A.A.)--Greek Cypriot Defense Minister 
Kostandinos Iliadhis will arrive in Athens today to hold talks 
on the "joint defense doctrine" between Greece and south Cyprus. 
Iliadhis, who will be accompanied by General D. Vorvolakos, 
commander of the Greek Cypriot National Guard, will hold talks 
on Tuesday [14 June] with Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis; 
Deputy Defense Minister Nikolaos Kouris; General Khristos 
Limberis, chief of the Greek General Staff; and the force 
commanders. 
  Although no official disclosure has been made on the joint 
defense doctrine, the increasing reports in Athens that Greece 
and south Cyprus have abandoned the concept because of foreign 
pressure and legal and military reasons have drawn attention. 
Sources close to the Greek Defense Ministry have said that the 
two sides will not be able to broaden their cooperation beyond 
the coordination of their rearmament programs. Regarding the 
legal reasons that have obstructed the realization of the 
agreement Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Greek Cypriot 
Leader Glavkos Kliridhis reached on the joint defense doctrine, 
the same sources said: "According to the Zurich Agreement, 
Greece is one of the guarantor powers of Cyprus. The 
implementation of the joint defense doctrine would violate the 
Zurich Agreement. Furthermore, as a member of NATO and the 
Western European Union [WEU], Greece does not have the right to 
conclude a joint defense agreement with a foreign country. Such 
an agreement would make south Cyprus look like a member of NATO 
and the WEU." 
  Regarding the military reasons for the abandonment of the 
doctrine, the sources said: "The joint defense doctrine will 
require the deployment of Greek troops, military aircraft, and 
arms in Cyprus. That is impossible under the existing 
conditions." 
  Meanwhile, the sources recalled the strong pressure the 
United States, NATO, and the European Union have put on Greece 
in connection with the joint defense doctrine. 
  Regarding the future of military cooperation between Greece 
and south Cyprus, the sources stressed the following: "What is 
left is the coordination of the rearmament programs and the 
plans that will be put into effect in the event of a war with 
Turkey. That process has been in effect for the past five 
years. Much of the arms of the Greek Armed Forces and the 
Greek Cypriot National Guard are similar. Meanwhile, Greece 
will probably supply the Greek Cypriots with the AMX-30 B-2 
tanks and Leonidas armored personnel carriers it will 
decommission and with some Milan antitank missiles. Joint 
military exercises may also be held in Greece. It is essential 
for the Greek Cypriots to establish their own air force units. 
Used Mirage F-1 and MiG-21 aircraft are available in the 
markets. They are in good condition and relatively inexpensive."

  [Text] The day after the elections is more important for 
the political parties. The results, which contradicted all 
preelection polls, have political party officials thinking 
seriously. Despite the euphoria of the smaller parties whose 
power was increased significantly, their officials are also 
examining the results seriously. 
  The final results were announced just a short while ago: 
PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] received 37.64 percent 
of the vote and 10 seats; New Democracy received 32.66 percent 
and nine seats; Political Spring received 8.65 percent and two 
seats; KKE [Greek Communist Party] received 6.29 percent and two 
seats; and the Coalition of the Left and Progress received 6.25 
percent and two seats. DIANA [Democratic Renewal], which 
received 2.79 percent of the vote, did not manage to elect a 
deputy to the European Parliament.

  [Text] State Minister Aykon Dogan has stated that Turkey

the European Union [EU] and added that, in turn, the EU should 
carry out its responsibilities. Dogan started his contacts with 
EU Commission and European Investment Bank officials. ANATOLIA

  [Begin Uluc recording] This morning, Dogan met with Sir Leon 
Brittan, the EU Trade Commissioner. During the meeting, Dogan 
briefed Sir Brittan on Turkey's macroeconomic balance and 
stability package and conveyed the technical difficulties Turkey 
faces regarding its integration into the customs union. 
Requesting a reassessment of Turkey's financial relations with 
the EU, Dogan stressed the necessity of expanding the trade 
volume. 
  Explaining that all the above will be discussed around a 
table in Brussels, Dogan stated that Turkey made a political 
decision regarding establishing a customs union with the EU and 
added that it is out of question for Turkey to change its mind 
on this issue. Noting that the customs union grants mutual tax 
liabilities to member countries, Dogan added that Turkey will 
make the necessary sacrifices and asked the EU to carry out its 
responsibilities. [end recording]

inspectors remain at nuclear sites in the communist nation, an 
IAEA spokesman said Tuesday [14 June]. 
  "Two IAEA inspectors at the Yongbyon nuclear plant in North 
Korea were informed that North Korea was withdrawing from the 
Agency by their North Korean colleagues," the spokesman, 
Hans-Friedrich Meyer, said. 
  "But the IAEA has not been informed of the North Korean 
withdrawal, either by that country or by the United States," he 
said. 
  He said the two IAEA inspectors, trying to determine if 
Pyongyang has a secret nuclear weapons program, "have not yet 
been asked by North Korea to leave the country." 
  China, a close North Korean ally, said Tuesday that it had 
also not been officially informed of North Korea's withdrawal 
from the IAEA. 
  According to IAEA rules, the North Korean government must 
officially inform the United States of its intention to quit the 
nuclear watchdog, a decision which would presumably mean 
expulsion of the inspectors. 
  The United States, the trustee of the Agency's ratification 
treaty, must then immediately inform the IAEA board of governors 
and the member states, Meyer explained. 
  North Korea's official KCNA news agency announced Monday 
that 
Pyongyang was withdrawing from the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog 
in retaliation for an Agency decision last Friday to enact mild 
sanctions against the communist government. 
  The sanctions -- cutting off technical assistance to 
Pyongyang -- were taken as punishment for the government's 
refusal to permit outside access to nuclear facilities and fuel 
rods extracted from a nuclear reactor. 
  Western intelligence agencies suspect that enough plutonium 
could be taken from the fuel rods to produce four or five 
nuclear weapons. 
  The UN Security Council is due to discuss a phased series of 
more serious sanctions against North Korea later this week. 
  Meyer said that North Korea's obligation to allow IAEA 
officials to inspect its nuclear facilities does not follow from 
its membership in the IAEA but from its signature of the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which North Korea has not yet 
withdrawn from. 
  Japanese and Western diplomats earlier said the real fear 
now 
was whether North Korea would leave the NPT, which bans members 
from using nuclear energy for a military purpose. 
  "The point of no-return has not been reached yet," a Western 
diplomat said. "The red line is whether they withdraw from NPT. 
Such decision will be much more serious because it would mean 
they are renouncing dialogue," he said. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin said meanwhile that he and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton had agreed to link the holding of a 
conference on the Korean crisis with phased sanctions against 
North Korea, the Russian government's ITAR-TASS news agency said.

  [Text] Vienna, June 15 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) said Wednesday [15 June] that two of its 
inspectors continued working at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear 
facility despite Pyongyng's withdrawal from the Agency. 
  "The inspectors have not yet been asked to leave Yongbyon," 
said IAEA spokesman Hans-Friedrich Meyer. 
  He added that the inspectors were continuing their work, but 
gave no further details. 
  Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state who is 
handling the North Korean standoff, warned in a CNN television 
interview that the very serious situation would deteriorate 
further if North Korea were to expel the two inspectors. 
  The IAEA says the inspectors are in North Korea in the 
framework of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which North 
Korea has not pulled out from. 
  But North Korea's defence minister said in remarks reported 
Wednesday that the country will not allow any further 
inspections of its nuclear facilities, which foreign governments 
suspect of developing nuclear weapons. 
  Marshal O Jin-U, speaking at a banquet late Tuesday for a 
visiting Vietnamese delegation, said his government had taken 
"self-defensive measures of withdrawing from the (IAEA) and of 
no longer allowing any kind of inspection." 
  On Monday, North Korea announced its immediate withdrawal 
from the IAEA after the UN nuclear watchdog body suspended 
technical aid to Pyongyang because of its refusal of full 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  The marshal said the IAEA had recently acted "arrogantly and 
insolently" when it demanded nuclear inspections "with the 
threat of sanctions." 
  He added that North Korea would uphold "our-style socialism" 
and reunify the divided Korea with the guidance of Kim Jong-Il, 
who took over the supreme command of the People's Army from his 
aging father, President Kim Il-Sung, in December 1991.

Cocaine Scene"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Dragan B. has been exposed as 
a cocaine dealer. He repeatedly smuggled cocaine from Belgium 
and Colombia to Austria. During his last coup he was caught in 
Dusseldorf by the German police, which had been alerted by the 
Austrians. He had 4 kg of cocaine on him with a street value of 
7.5 million schillings. One kilogram of cocaine from previous 
deliveries was found in the possession of eight gang members, 
among whom it had been distributed. 
  In Belgium, the Vienna police has now established the 
identity of a high-ranking Belgian NATO officer who had supplied 
the cocaine. The Belgian authorities, however, have so far 
ignored the Austrian investigations: Not only has the arrest 
warrant not been executed, and the suspect, who has been 
incriminated by several witnesses, has not only not been 
extradited, the Belgians have not even arrested the man. "This 
man is somehow untouchable," police sources said. 
  Eight individuals have been arrested, while complaints 
against another 25 have been filed. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report signed "jost.": "Sluggish Trade With Arab Region"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- There was a clear slump in Austria's 
foreign trade with Arab countries last year. Exports and 
imports decreased by 11.4 percent each. However, with just 
under 2.8 billion Austrian schillings [AS], the total trade 
surplus with these countries was well over AS600 million higher 
than last year's surplus. 
  This surplus could even be surpassed this year if the 
present 
positive trend continues, Egon Winkler, foreign economy chief of 
the Federal Economic Chamber, stated at a news conference. In 
the first quarter of this year, exports to this world region 
increased by 14.9 percent, while imports from there decreased by 
14.3 percent. 
  Winkler blamed the decline in the oil price and the late 
effects of the Gulf war for the decrease in trade with the Arab 
countries. So far, it has not been possible to make up for 
these losses. Because of the UN embargo against Iraq, this 
important export market where Austrian goods valued at 2.2 
billion schillings had, after all, been ordered before was also 
lost. However, the peace process provides new hope for an 
economic recovery of the region. In the near future, the 
foreign trade organization will deal in detail with relations 
with the state of Palestine, which is just developing, he said. 
  By far, the most important trade partner is Saudi Arabia, 
which bought Austrian goods for more than 2.5 billion 
schillings. Austria's imports from there, which consist almost 
entirely of oil, account for 2.1 billion schilings.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Gerfried Sperl: "A European Sensation"] </F>
  [Text] Support for European Union [EU] membership, which 
has been sensationally high by European standards, is first and 
foremost an enormous political success for the grand coalition 
and a personal boost for Alois Mock. The Social Democratic 
Party of Austria [SPOe] and the Austrian People's Party [OeVP], 
Franz Vranitzky and Erhard Busek, have achieved the main 
objective of their government and no longer have to waste any 
time dwelling on the past: Their election campaign for the 
parliamentary election in October should focus on clear ideas 
for the future and avoid narrow-minded polemics. 
  Even more so, since this Sunday [12 June] also brought a 
defeat for Joerg Haider, who wanted to turn 12 June into a day 
of voting out the Vranitzky government. He failed 
spectacularly. Particularly in urban areas, which is where the 
Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] sees great potential for 
support, 75-percent majorities in favor of the EU were quite 
frequent -- with the number of opponents in many cases not 
rising beyond the share of the electorate held by the FPOe, the 
Greens, and Communists. This allows another interpretation of 
the result: Even those less well-off and the less-educated 
hardly fell into the trap represented by the slogans of fear 
launched so violently by TAEGLICH ALLES -- a sign of political 
matureness, as was the high voter turnout, which was not the 
result of weather conditions. 
  Nevertheless, no one should believe that the advance of the 
FPOe has now been stopped or even that the SPOe and OeVP can now 
be sure of defending their share in the fall election. It is 
probably true what Vranitzky and his government team pointed out 
on television again and again: The EU referendum was not the 
right vote to give someone "a good lesson," because the parties' 
performance should be evaluated in the fall. This was 
understood by Austrians, and they were capable of 
differentiating. They have given the FPOe leader something to 
think about. Nevertheless, the Austrians may well go for 
escapism this fall by, for example, confirming the same Joerg 
Haider once more as the bad boy of this republic in the fall. 
  Of equally high importance is the effect of this result 
internationally. It looks as if Austria has finally recovered 
from the setbacks of the Waldheim years. Such clear EU votes 
are rare, which is why the Austrians will be able to present 
themselves in Brussels with a rather high degree of 
self-confidence. There are two more aspects: First, the EU 
referenda in the two Scandinavian countries and in Finland will 
undoubtedly be influenced by the Austrian yes, while in 
Switzerland the debate on Europe will flare up again. Even more 
so since Switzerland yesterday voted against participating in UN 
peace missions. Its international reputation will suffer and 
the polarization between "internationalists" and "isolationists" 
will grow. 
  Second, our neighbors -- the Czech Republic, Hungary, and 
Slovakia -- will understand the result as a support for their 
ambitions to be able to join the EU at the turn of the century, 
which would offer them better protection against Russian 
ambitions, which might flare up again at any moment. Austria 
therefore has a leading role in these former "satellite 
countries." 
  Despite all these positive points, one should not ignore 
responsibility toward those Austrians who voted no. After all, 
they are not only fearful people or egocentrics. Many excellent 
scientists, numerous critical artists, and a considerable 
percentage of worried farmers (just to name a few groups) asked 
questions that have to remain on the political agenda. 
  The oft-cited maturity of the citizens must be complemented 
by openness on the part of the government in taking account of 
criticism in its EU policy and the readiness of the media to 
publicize the arguments of EU opponents.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Freddy Melaert: "Increased Support for Party </F>
of the Disillusioned"] 
  [Text] One of the major lessons which Belgium must learn 
from the European elections is that Europe has certainly not 
proved a winner. And, unfortunately, the principal political 
parties must stand accused, despite their denials, of having 
diverted these elections from their real objective. 
  The results show that many voters cast their votes on the 
basis of domestic issues, reflecting wide-ranging 
disillusionment. The government coalition parties have received 
a reprimand, and a relatively harsh one at that. Apart from the 
scandals, they have also suffered the consequences of the 
unpopular austerity plan and of having so far failed to 
reconcile, as they promised, the citizen and politics. 
Unacceptable as it may be, we have to accept that the big 
winner in these elections is the party of those disillusioned 
with the political system and of those who voted in large 
numbers for the extreme right, who split their vote among small 
parties with no future, or sought refuge in an apparently very 
significant abstention vote. In French-speaking Belgium, the PS 
[Socialist Party] suffered a very severe defeat. The virtuous 
words of Philippe Busquin did not succeed in neutralizing the 
negative impact on the PS's image of the scandals that have been 
so much discussed of late. The devastation would have been 
worse still without the presence of popular and increasingly 
ambitious Jose Happart heading the party's list of candidates. 
  The PSC [French-speaking Social Christian Party] also lost 
considerable ground, and that was a personal failure for its 
president, Gerard Deprez. His reelection as party president, 
previously taken for granted, has now been thrown wide open. 
The loss of support for the PSC is probably partly due to the 
Demaret-Thys scandal. As to the Ecologists, they have probably 
been punished for their misalliance with the majority on the 
vote on institutional reform in return for ecotaxes, a move that 
was both improvised and unpopular. A part of their electorate 
will not forgive them for having entered the troubled waters of 
the policy-making. 
  As to the PRL [French-speaking Liberal reformation 
Party]-FDF 
[French-speaking Democratic Front] alliance, its strategy no 
doubt paid off. But will its increased support be confirmed at 
the next elections? The question is pertinent to the extent 
that it most certainly harvested protest votes which are by 
definition volatile. Nevertheless, the PRL-FDF is now just a few 
points behind the previously dominant PS. On the other hand, 
the Flemish Liberals suffered a bitter defeat. They fell far 
short of achieving their ambition to unseat the CVP [Flemish 
Christian Democratic Party] as Flanders' leading party. 
  An initial conclusion is that the desire for political 
change 
by the Liberals at the national and the regional level will 
probably not be achieved immediately. Despite or precisely 
because of their defeat, the majority parties now seem destined 
to continue through to the end of their term as early elections 
would threaten to be disastrous for all concerned. They must 
therefore make every effort to return to form and endeavour to 
take concrete account of the problems in society which lie at 
the root of the worrying advance of the extreme right. The 
Liberals day has yet to come.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands Turnout Almost Lowest </F>
in Europe"] 
  [Text] The Netherlands turnout of 35.6 percent at the 
elections for the European Parliament (EP) was one of the lowest 
in Europe. 
  The distribution of seats among the 31 Netherlands 
representatives at the EP was in line with forecasts at the 
close of voting on Thursday [9 June]. The CDA [Christian 
Democratic Appeal] wins 10 seats, the PvdA [Labor Party] eight, 
the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] six, D66 
[Democrats 66] four, the coalition comprising the Political 
Reformed Party, the Reformed Political Union, and the 
Reformational Political Federation wins two seats, and the Green 
Left one. 
  The leaders of the main parties expressed disappointment at 
the low turnout among Netherlands voters for the European 
elections. VVD leader Bolkestein finds the low turnout, not only 
in the Netherlands but in other European countries too, grounds 
for reflection on the future of the European Union (EU). At the 
VVD party council on Saturday, he stated that the EU must 
reflect upon some essential questions. "Europe does not seem to 
be sufficiently relevant to the voter," Bolkestein stated. 
  The biggest winner in the European elections in the 
Netherlands was D66, increasing its seats from one to four. The 
VVD doubled its seats from three to six. Bolkestein described 
this as a "good result." But given the low turnout, he does not 
believe the results can be taken as indicative of the results of 
a national election. 
  The CDA and the PvdA remain at their former levels with 10 
and eight seats, but their actual loss of support was masked by 
the fact that the number of Netherlands seats in the EP has been 
increased from 25 to 31. The small Christian parties increased 
their seats from one to two. The Green Left was the only real 
loser, down from two to one seat. 
  PvdA leader Kok does not believe the results can be compared 
to the national political situation. He described the turnout 
as "very poor." The Netherlands Euro MP's will have a hard job 
in making people feel more concerned by Europe, Kok believes. 
CDA leader Brinkman also described the turnout as 
disappointing. The good score achieved by the CDA is 
"encouraging" Brinkman stated on Saturday at the CDA party 
council. Opinion polls had predicted a sharp fall in CDA 
support.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "`Purple' Coalition Agrees on 13 </F>
Billion Guilders Savings"] 
  [Text] Negotiators for a `purple' coalition government 
[comprising the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the Democrats 
66, and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD)] have 
reached agreement on savings of 13 billion guilders [G]. This 
is clear from a list drawn up at the end of last week by the 
three politicians who have been appointed by the Crown to assess 
the feasibility of the coalition. 
  National budget cuts are set to produce savings of G6.9 
billion. Depending on the interpretation, savings on social 
security expenditure are to produce a further G5.8 to G6.1 
billion. These are all savings on which the parties have 
reached agreement. The parties are still seeking measures 
through which the amount available for tax cuts and reducing the 
public deficit would exceed this G13 billion mark. 
  The Central Planning Bureau calculated the proposals over 
the 
weekend. They include plans to increase jobs and boost 
purchasing power. On the basis of these calculations the 
negotiators will determine how high the total amount of savings 
will be during the next term of government. All those involved 
accept that conclusions will be reached this week together with 
a final decision on whether or not a `purple' coalition is to be 
formed. 
  Today the negotiators are discussing, among other things, 
tax 
cuts and how to finance them, together with employment 
conditions in the public sector. 
  VVD leader Bolkestein described the negotiations this 
afternoon as "important but not yet crucial." The parties are 
still aiming to submit the government pact to the Second Chamber 
for debate in mid- July. 
  PvdA [Labor Party], VVD, and D66 representatives are also 
busy considering elements of a government pact outside the 
social economic field. A total of eight policy areas have been 
allocated that cover the full range of government activities. 
These include the environment and planning, and security in 
large towns. 
  At the CDA party council last Saturday [11 June], Brinkman 
was critical of the fact that the negotiators are working on the 
basis of excessively optimistic economic growth figures. "The 
negotiators are apparently mesmerized by the unexpectedly 
favorable economic growth," Brinkman says. "This is dangerous 
at a time of continuing high unemployment and public debt and 
this is why all the election programs cautiously counted on four 
years with an average growth of 1.75 percent." The CDA leader 
believes that the need for additional policy "is certainly true" 
because otherwise in four years time there will be 815,000 
unemployed and 850,000 people on disability benefit.

<F P=106> [Article by Bettina Hubo: "Netherlands Speculates on </F>
Lubbers' Chances for European Commission Presidency"] 
  [Excerpt] What will be the repercussions of the election 
results for outgoing Netherlands Prime Minister Lubbers' chances 
for the European Commission (EC) presidency? Differing answers 
have been given to this question. Maij-Wegen, heading the list 
of CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] candidates, considers that 
the election results will favor Lubbers since the CDA remains 
the largest Netherlands party in Europe. De Vries and Bertens, 
who are heading the list of VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy] and D66 [Democrats 66] candidates, respectively, feel 
on the contrary that the poor turnout will work against Lubbers. 
EC Commissioner van den Broek said that the low level of 
interest shown by Netherlanders in the elections does not bode 
well for Lubbers. He fears that the Netherlanders' European 
convictions may be questioned. [passage omitted]

  [Text] London, 14 Jun (TANJUG) -- British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd today received a Montenegrin delegation headed by 
Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. 
  The Montenegrin delegation was received this afternoon by 
Douglas Hogg, state minister at the Foreign Office, and visited 
the British Council. 
  The Montenegrin delegation also includes Deputy Prime 
Minister Kruno Vukcevic and Foreign Minister Miodrag Lekic. 
  It has been learned from the delegation that the talks 
centred on the crisis in former Yugoslavia, especially the 
search for a peaceful solution in Bosnia-Hezcegovina. The hosts 
asked the Montenegrin delegation to convey their appeal to the 
Yugoslav side to help in the establishment of peace in Bosnia by 
influencing the Bosnian Serbs to accept the proposed 51:49 
territorial ratio. 
  According to Milo Djukanovic, Montenegro will do all it can 
to find a peaceful solution as soon as possible. 
  The hosts were also informed about the consequences of the 
international sanctions on the Montenegrin economy, and the 
government delegation requested Britain's aid in opening a ferry 
line to Italy for humanitarian reasons, and to enable the 
blocked Montenegrin ships to return to their home ports. 
  The Montenegrin delegation will be meeting members of the 
British-Yugoslav group in the British Parliament tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Speech by Stella Rimington, director general of the British </F>
secret service, MI5, as part of the "Richard Dimbleby Lecture 
Program" in London--live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] As a nation, we have always 
been fascinated by the so-called secret services. English 
literature contains a long line of spy fiction from Kipling's 
"Kim" through John Buchan, to John Le Carre, and many more 
besides. It's exciting stuff, and it's led to the creation of 
many myths and some lurid speculation about our work. I must 
admit that it's with some hesitation that I set out tonight to 
shed some daylight. I have a sneaking feeling that the fiction 
may turn out to be more fun than the reality. 
  I want to explain what MI5--or the security service--does, 
why it's needed, and how it's accountable. I shall show that a 
security service is an important plank in the defense of a free 
society and of its civil liberties and basic values. 
  A security service does not conflict with democracy, even 
though it must work largely in secret--provided it's properly 
overseen and controlled, as it is in this country. Britain has 
three different security and intelligence services. The 
security service, MI5, is the service I lead. MI6 is the secret 
intelligence--also known as SIS--and the third is the Government 
Communications Headquarters, GCHQ. 
  I blame George Smiley [character from television series] for 
some of the confusion. In his role as the mole hunter, he was 
clearly doing MI5's work, but recruiting foreign agents behind 
the Iron Curtain placed him firmly in MI6. In fact, we are 
three separate organizations with different functions. We work 
closely together, and we have the highest regard for each 
other's professionalism. 
  So what do we all do? The primary role for both SIS and GCHQ 
is to collect the foreign intelligence which is needed to 
protect and support British interests. The security service, 
MI5, on the other hand, is the defensive service, the national 
security intelligence agency, and it's the security service I 
shall be talking about tonight. Our role is to safeguard the 
survival and well-being of the state against substantial threats 
which are covertly organized and purposeful. 
  Throughout history governments have insured that they get to 
know about matters affecting the security of the state. The 
first documented security service in England was in Queen 
Elizabeth's time, under Sir Francis Walsingham. He successfully 
uncovered a number of plots against her, although she paid him 
so poorly that he was driven to the verge of bankruptcy. There 
is no innuendo in that observation. Sir Francis probably did 
very much as he was ordered. 
  Today our functions are formerly set out in the act of 
parliament--the Security Service Act--which is our mandate. But 
why do we need a security service in 1994? The modern security 
service was founded in 1909 to counter the threat of German 
espionage. Both before and during the First World War, large 
numbers of spies were rounded up. During the second war, the 
service had the leading counterespionage role, and it played a 
central part in the double- cross operation designed to mislead 
Hitler about the D-Day landing sites. During the Cold War, much 
of the service's effort again went to countering the 
sophisticated and well-resourced intelligence services of the 
Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies as they searched for 
this country's secrets. But since the collapse of communism, 
the threats to national security and the tasks they generate for 
us have changed greatly. Countering espionage now takes less 
than a quarter of our resources--half what it was three years 
ago, and a far cry from the position at the height of the Cold 
War. 
  The fall of the communist regimes and the disintegration of 
the Soviet Union were fundamental changes, and the service moved 
rapidly to respond to them. We developed links with a number of 
countries in the former Warsaw Pact once we were satisfied that 
democracy had taken hold and espionage against us had ceased. 
Together with our sister service, SIS, we provided advice and 
support for the reorganized and reoriented security services, 
particularly to help them establish a democratic framework for 
their work. We also began to exchange information on areas 
where there were shared concerns, crucially encountering 
terrorism. 
  This was an exciting time for officers from both sides of 
the 
old Iron Curtain, and there were many intriguing encounters 
between former adversaries. But the development of these links 
to our newly democratic counterparts in Central Europe was an 
important success. Last year, for example, a joint operation 
involving a number of agencies halted a large consignment of 
weapons originating in Poland and destined for so-called 
loyalist terrorists in Northern Ireland. 
  The situation in Russia is different. Considerable progress 
has been made towards democratic reform. We no longer need fear 
the intense military related espionage against us associated 
with the Cold War. The cataclysmic threats of the nuclear 
exchange or of an attack have receded, but the process of reform 
is still vulnerable, and in the Russian security and 
intelligence services it's less far advanced. 
  Both in this country and abroad there has been clear 
evidence from the sort of threats from espionage which we still 
need to counter. The case of Aldrich Ames, the CIA officer in 
the United States who recently pleaded guilty to spying, is one 
example. Although a year or so ago the Russians reduced the 
number of their intelligence officers here, the total has now 
begun to creep up again. We must, therefore, remain on our 
guard. A spokesman for the Russian intelligence service has 
said recently: There are friendly states, but no friendly 
intelligence services. I don't believe this. It should be in 
our interests to establish the same sort of professional liaison 
with the Russian services that we successfully established 
elsewhere--including in the former Eastern bloc--but there's 
still a considerable way to go. Of course, the Warsaw Pact was 
not the only source of foreign espionage, and other countries do 
still pose a threat, but it is by and large of a different and 
lesser order. 
  The other significant change in the service's work since the 
collapse of Soviet communism has been in relation to subversion. 
This is a much misunderstood and contentious area, largely 
because everyone has their own definition. The word subversion 
itself doesn't appear in the Security Service Act, although the 
sense is conveyed in the phrase: activities intended to 
overthrow or undermine parliamentary democracy by political, 
industrial, or violent means. 
  The intention to undermine democracy is what subversion 
means 
to us. It does not include political dissent. Many of those 
whom the service had to investigate were members of parties and 
organizations which made no secret of their wish to undermine 
parliamentary democracy. There were others who kept their true 
objectives secret. Some, such as the communists, were loyal to 
the Soviet Union and its allies. Others--for example, the 
Trotskyists--were fiercely critical of what they dubbed state 
capitalism. That made no difference to their determination to 
replace the democratic system with one of their own choosing. 
The service set out to identify all the members of these 
subversive groups and to investigate their activities. This was 
particularly necessary so that they could be denied access to 
secret information through the vetting system which Mr. Atlee 
introduced in 1949. 
  In its rise to power, the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union 
set great store by infiltrating and manipulating organizations 
such as trade unions. The Communist Party of Great Britain 
followed this doctrine enthusiastically, with the aim of 
bringing their influence to bear covertly and in a way that was 
far out of proportion to the negligible support they could 
achieve through the ballot box. Activity of this sort was of 
concern to successive governments and was a legitimate subject 
of attention by the security service. The allegation that the 
service investigated organizations that were not in themselves 
subversive is quite untrue. Our interest was in the 
subversives, not in the organizations they sought to penetrate. 
  I've spoken in the past tense because over the last 10 years 
the threat from subversion has diminished dramatically. It now 
requires less than 5 percent of our time. Some of that is now 
devoted to groups on the extreme right for seeking to undermine 
democracy through the exploitation of racial hatred and 
xenophobia. But the service's overwhelming focus today, three 
quarters of our work, is concentrated on terrorism--terrorism 
originating both from within the United Kingdom and from abroad. 
For the past 20 years or so, the security service has been 
responsible for coordinating intelligence work against terrorism 
carried out from overseas and with the potential to affect this 
country's interests anywhere in the world. 
  In countering this international terrorism, we work closely 
with others, including SIS and GCHQ, and of course the police 
forces and other agencies in this country and abroad. Over the 
past two years, and leaving aside the UK, terrorist attacks have 
taken place worldwide at the rate of nearly one a day. This 
illustrates the extent of the problem, and there are clearly 
limits to what could be done to prevent attacks which are 
planned and launched from abroad, even when many services work 
closely together. 
  Nevertheless, we have together had many successes, most of 
them I'm afraid necessarily unsung. But, as one example, we've 
helped to prevent the intelligence services of a number of 
Middle Eastern states from carrying out sustained campaigns of 
murder against their opponents in this country and elsewhere. 
Members of Islamic terrorist groups and terrorists from the 
Indian subcontinent have been identified and their plans 
disrupted. The service played a major part in the investigation 
of the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie in December 1988, to 
the point where the atrocity was laid firmly at the door of 
Libya. As a result, Libya came under further significant 
international pressure to cut its support for 
terrorists--including the Provisional IRA--and, of course, to 
surrender the accused for trial. 
  The threat to British interests from terrorism of 
international origin is lower than it was in the 1980's. This 
is partly because we have in place better means of exchanging 
intelligence than before, both nationally and internationally. 
But, in the foreseeable future, I expect there to remain a 
significant threat to British interests, although the sources of 
it will vary from time to time. For example, the determined 
efforts to locate and kill the author Salman Rushdie seemed 
likely to go on. 
  Extremists from North Africa and also Kurdish groups pose 
an increasing threat of violence, including to British tourists, 
and the conflict in former Yugoslavia could well spill over into 
acts of terrorism in Europe and elsewhere. But the services 
most important task--and one which takes up nearly half our 
resources--is mounting intelligence operations to counter Irish 
terrorism. The Provisional IRA, in particular, is a 
sophisticated and ruthless terrorist organization and poses the 
most serious threat to our national security. As they talk of 
peace, the IRA continues to carry out terrorist murders in 
Northern Ireland. At the same time, they plan and mount attacks 
in mainland Britain, as we saw at Heathrow. In parallel, the 
so-called Loyalist paramilitary groups have continued with their 
own brand of indiscriminate violence. 
  Intelligence gathering against terrorists is difficult and 
dangerous. Some of my staff and many of those who work closely 
with us risk their lives to do it. They do it from a sense of 
public service and a firm belief in the rule of law and the 
democratic system. It's an anxious life for their families, who 
support them because they, too, believe in the importance of 
their work. When tragedy strikes, as it did on such a scale 
with a helicopter crash on 2 June, they suffer their losses 
silently and with dignity. We have much cause to be grateful to 
them all. 
  Intelligence work against Irish terrorism is closely 
coordinated, but it is complex, and I should make it clear what 
the security service does and does not do. In Northern Ireland, 
the security service provides extensive support for the Royal 
Ulster Constabulary, who take the lead in gathering and 
exploiting intelligence relating to terrorism there, in addition 
to their police work. Outside Northern Ireland, the security 
service has the main responsibility for intelligence 
investigations into all aspects of Irish terrorist activity 
anywhere in the world. We investigate IRA plans for terrorist 
attacks against British military personnel in Europe or 
elsewhere, or into their efforts and those of the so-called 
Loyalists groups to obtain arms and funds from abroad. Many of 
our counterparts in Europe and further afield give us unstinting 
support and assistance. 
  Until the autumn of 1992, our responsibilities for 
operations 
against the IRA did not cover the British mainland, where the 
Metropolitan Police Special Branch coordinated intelligence work 
against all republican terrorism. Then, in October 1992, the 
security service was also given this responsibility. This made 
sense as far as intelligence operations were concerned, but the 
service has not assumed any of the executive powers of the 
police. And, of course, we continue to work closely both with 
the Metropolitan Police and with other police forces. They all 
play a central role in countering Irish terrorism. These new 
arrangements have achieved a sharper focus, as well as a greater 
concentration of resources. 
  All the agencies involved in countering terrorism in the UK 
cooperate closely and effectively, but counterterrorism is not 
an exact science. In an open and democratic society, the 
initial advantage will always lie with the terrorists. We will 
never be able to obtain 100 percent advance information of 
terrorists' plans and intentions. There are successes. Many 
terrorist operations planned and begun are stopped through 
advanced intelligence. Whenever it's possible, the perpetrators 
are brought to court. Over the past 18 months or so, more than 
20 Irish Republican terrorists have been arrested in Great 
Britain and charged. In Northern Ireland, the security forces 
prevent four out of five terrorist attacks which are attempted. 
All totaled, some 700 terrorists--both Republican and 
Loyalist--have been convicted and are currently serving prison 
sentences. Many others are awaiting trial. 
  The Security Service Act makes clear that the work of the 
service must be strictly limited to countering only threats to 
national security. We are not involved in countering drug 
trafficking or organized crime, and we would only become 
involved if they came to pose such a threat to this country. 
  One new task which the service has recently taken on is 
helping to counter the spread of weapons of mass 
destruction--nuclear, biological, and chemical. This is not a 
new threat, of course, but it's been made more immediate by the 
collapse of the Soviet Union. General instability there has 
resulted in the loosening of controls over both sensitive 
materials and related expertise. Some two dozen governments are 
currently trying to obtain such technology. A number of these 
countries sponsor or even practice terrorism, and we can't rule 
out the possibility that these weapons could be used for that 
purpose. Some governments try every means--including enrolling 
their students at British universities--to bypass international 
agreements to obtain what they want. We're now working closely 
with others to identify and prevent their efforts. 
  I've described some of the threats which we currently face, 
but what does protecting national security actually mean? How 
do we do it? Those people who wish to damage the state will 
naturally organize themselves and make plans in secret, so we 
have to use secret means to investigate them. With the proper 
legal authority, we may need to tap their telephones, open their 
letters, or eavesdrop on their conversations to find out their 
intentions. We may have to observe their movements secretly or 
recruit members of those organizations as agents to tell us from 
the inside what's being planned. Then we have to analyze and 
assess the information and use our findings to counter the harm 
which is intended. 
  MI5 has no executive powers, so we pass on information to 
others and discuss with them what action they can take--to the 
police, for example, so that arrests can be made, or to the Home 
Office or the Foreign Office so that terrorists or intelligence 
officers can be deported or expelled. Of course, it's also 
possible to protect whatever is threatened, so we advise on how 
to make the target more difficult to attack. We might, for 
example, suggest measures to protect a building or the people in 
it from terrorist attack or measures to protect data if there's 
reason to think that secret information is at risk. 
  I should also like to clear up a fairly widespread 
misunderstanding. I've heard it said that the service is 
responsible for monitoring the activities of people with a high 
public profile on the off chance--so the argument goes--that 
they might either be at or even pose a risk. We do not do it; 
such interference would not be justified. I and my staff 
believe deeply that, as a matter of principle, the very serious 
step of intruding into people's private lives must be strictly 
limited to what is unavoidable in the interests of national 
security and must, of course, be properly authorized. 
  The question is also asked, following the ending of the Cold 
War: Are we using our peace dividend to turn our attention to 
the general public, or for that matter, anyone else about whom 
we or perhaps the government feel uncomfortable? The idea is 
quite frankly quite ludicrous, just as ludicrous as the 
allegation I once heard made that the service carries out 
murder. But these ideas, unfounded though they are, bring me to 
the key question of accountability for a security service. 
  Accountability lies at the heart of the tension between 
liberty and security, and I'm going to say something about 
oversight and controls, without which a security service could 
put in jeopardy those very rights and liberties which it has 
been set up to protect. A delicate balance must be struck within 
the framework of government in determining how far the security 
service should be allowed to go in invading the privacy of the 
few in the interests of the nation as a whole. 
  How to insure that a service such as ours does not exceed 
its 
remit? The need for such a balance is reflected in 
international law, and particularly in the European Convention 
on Human Rights. The convention recognizes that a state has a 
duty and a right to protect itself. In doing so, it may set up 
a security service to provide a covert response to covertly 
organized threats, but the convention also makes clear that the 
state must respect individual rights and liberties. It must put 
its secret services on a clear legal basis, and it must 
establish independent oversight to ensure that these services 
never abuse their powers. There is, of course, much room for 
debate about how best to regulate and control the activities of 
a security service. 
  This raises difficult issues. What does control actually 
mean when what we're talking about is activity which must 
necessarily be carried out in secret. How close should the 
relationship be between the government and the security service? 
In a totalitarian state, such as the old Soviet bloc, the 
security service, in effect, becomes an arm of the ruling party 
and the government. Its purpose is to keep them in power by 
ensuring virtually complete control over all aspects of life. 
They see the people themselves as one of the main threats to 
the state, and so the political thought police watch everyone to 
ensure that all dissent is stamped out. One only has to think 
of the all-pervasive East German secret police, the Stasi, with 
its thousands of informants, for a horrific modern example. 
  In a sophisticated democracy, the relationship between the 
government and the security service is completely different. 
The security service must operate within a clear framework of 
law. Its activities must be limited to countering genuine 
threats to national security, and controls are needed to govern 
how it may use but not abuse its powers. But, and this is 
equally important, there must also be political independence. 
The government must not be able to pressure the service to do 
anything which is not directly concerned with genuine threats to 
national security. Neither must the service do anything which 
would favor one political party over another. To carry out its 
functions, the security service clearly has to conduct its 
operations in secret, so in the future, as in the past, there 
will be little opportunity for the public to find out in any 
detail what we are doing. Mechanisms for oversight and 
accountability are therefore vital in providing reassurance as 
well as control. 
  The legal authority for our service is the Security Service 
Act of 1989. The act puts the controls contained in the 
directive issued to the service in 1952 and endorsed by the home 
secretaries of all subsequent governments on a formal statutory 
footing. As director general, Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm fully 
conscious of the overriding importance of proper accountability 
for our service. Members of the service at all levels regard the 
legal framework which the Security Service Act provides as 
fundamental to everything we do, and we welcomed it warmly. The 
framework of controls provided by the act involves 
ministers--principally the home secretary, independent members 
of the judiciary, and senior civil servants in Whitehall. The 
main plank of the system is the relationship with the secretary 
general and the home secretary. I am accountable to him for the 
operations of the service and for its efficiency. I'm 
personally responsible under the act for ensuring that the 
service remains independent of any party political influence and 
that it does nothing beyond what is permitted under the act. 
  One of the most important aspects of my role is to ensure 
that the services investigations are always proportionate to the 
threat. The most intrusive techniques may only be used to 
counter the most serious threats. No officer may carry out any 
investigation unless it falls within strict rules and 
guidelines. There's a wide range of controls in place within the 
service. They cover all levels of activity. Those governing 
investigations which may invade the privacy of the individual 
are particularly important. Let me give you an example. 
Applications to the secretary of state for warrants to 
intercept letters or telephone conversations or to interfere 
with property are rigorously examined by the service's legal 
advisers and by the most senior levels of management and again 
within the Home Office. We in the service and the civil 
servants and ministers who work with us are fully aware of the 
power we wield when we carry out secret investigations. We 
recognize that this power must be exercised reasonably and 
responsibly, and it's certainly not something which is taken 
lightly or for granted by any of us. 
  There are commissioners who scrutinize the propriety of 
warrants signed by the secretary of state, and there are 
tribunals to investigate any complaints from the public about 
our work. These external oversight bodies, set up under both 
the interception and the Security Service Acts, are comprised of 
experienced and independent legal figures who can and do read 
any papers they wish and interview staff. Their powers 
represent a substantial check and also a significant 
disincentive for anyone to flout the rules. 
  The service works totally within statute and within the law, 
and we never subcontract operations to get around the rules or 
to evade oversight and control. On the contrary, we give 
absolute priority to ensuring that everything we do is carried 
out with the proper authority. 
  I've described the existing systems of oversight and 
accountability which are provided for the service, and I've 
explained that we regard them as vital in providing a vigorous 
and independent check on everything we do. In exactly the same 
way, I and the service wholeheartedly welcome the new oversight 
committee of parliamentarians which is provided under the new 
Intelligence Services Act. This committee will play a 
significant part in ensuring that the work of the three 
intelligence and security agencies have the confidence of both 
Parliament and the public. We shall give it our full support 
and cooperation. 
  A cynic may ask: How can I know that what you are saying is 
true? Well, it is difficult for an organization which must work 
in secret to talk about what it does and to satisfy its critics. 
This dilemma is one of the prices of our constant efforts to 
maintain the right balance between security and democracy. One 
result is the tendency for completely untrue conspiracy theories 
to emerge. These may have a certain populist market value, but 
they sidetrack and obstruct serious consideration of the issues. 
One of the most persistent came from the well-publicized claims 
of Peter Wright that MI5 plotted to undermine the then Prime 
Minister Harold Wilson. No such plot existed--as ministers 
stated and as Peter Wright himself finally admitted. But, this 
was a very damaging assertion, particularly so, as it called 
into question the services political impartiality which we are 
so determined to uphold. Now, in this sort of case the service 
finds itself in something of a catch-22 situation. But the 
point is this: We are a service of some 2,000 people working 
everyday with a wide range of contacts both inside and outside 
government. How likely is it that we are all in the grip of 
what I can really only call institutional corruption. Part of 
the answer--and also to the point I raised just now about our 
credibility--lies in effective oversight and control, but it 
also touches on integrity and the sort of people we are. 
  I remember on one occasion, shortly after I became director 
general, someone I met for the first time appeared genuinely 
surprised that I wasn't more like Rosa Kleb, one of James Bond's 
rather less than democratic counterparts. We are, of course, a 
service of ordinary people drawn from a variety of backgrounds 
and with a wide range of qualities. About half of us are female 
and half are under 40, and there is a strong independent input 
to the recruitment of our staff. Fortunately, it's no longer 
necessary for anyone to pass one of the tests which was imposed 
on recruits to the service in 1914. Then staff had to show that 
they could make notes on their shirt cuff while cantering on 
horseback, but our staff have other skills relevant to our work 
today. They are selective because of their judgment, 
impartiality, and integrity, all of which contribute to a strong 
ethos within the service. As in all organizations, there 
may--very occasionally--be the odd rotten apple. And I 
certainly wouldn't claim that we are infallible, but I am 
certain--not least because of the closely integrated way in 
which we all work--that there is no group of mavericks in our 
service pursuing some private agenda of their own. 
  Well, that's who we are and how we are accountable to others 
for our secret work. But, inevitably and unavoidably, almost 
all oversight is carried out within the so-called ring of 
secrecy, but my colleagues and I know very well that we must 
also have the confidence of the general public. We know the 
importance of explaining, as much as we can, what the service 
does, and I'm delighted to have this opportunity to so. It 
certainly wasn't open to any of my predecessors, although I'm 
sure they would have welcomed it. 
  We are, of course, obliged to keep information secret in 
order to be effective, but this is not to say that we should 
necessarily be a wholly secret organization. Secrecy is not 
imposed for its own sake; it's not an end in itself. There have 
been a number of steps over the past number of years to increase 
the level of information available, and not only about the 
security service. The fact that I'm talking to you this evening 
following the publication last year of a booklet about the 
service is evidence of the continuing commitment to this process. 
  The media, of course, have an important role to play in 
shaping public perceptions of what we are and what we do. The 
press in this country has, over time, developed a particular 
interest in security and intelligence affairs. I hope that, by 
means of greater openness and by making more facts available, it 
will be possible to portray the work of this service in a rather 
more sober light and, above all, much more accurately than is 
sometimes the case now. I have no doubt that more information 
about what we do will emerge over time, particularly because of 
our increasing involvement as witnesses in criminal trials 
where, incidentally, we also have to account for what we have 
done. I welcome these developments, but we need to make it 
quite clear that there must be strict limits. 
  The service cannot do, or say anything which would endanger 
our staff, our sources, or our operations. Many people outside 
the service, some of whom will be watching this evening, 
regularly provide us with vital assistance and often put 
themselves in danger by doing so. I would like to say, here, in 
public, how grateful we are. You play a valuable role in 
helping to look after the safety and security of the country, 
and we thank you very much. Nothing will be said or done to 
compromise your safety or the work you are doing on our behalf. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, I've set out in this lecture to show 
that a security service such as MI5 is compatible with personal 
liberty within our democracy. It does not conflict with it but 
enhances it. I've explained why the service is still needed in 
the post Cold War era, how it is controlled and made accountable 
for what it does. We are a modern, efficient, and law-abiding 
service to the nation. Our principle task today is to help to 
counter the threat from terrorism to this country. We've 
changed with the times. We're still changing and will continue

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Terrorist Friends on the Rhine"] </F>
  [Text] A militant support group of the terrorist Red Army 
Faction (RAF) is active in the greater Duesseldorf area. 
Experts from the Office for the Protection of the Constitution 
are proceeding on this assumption after analyzing the bomb 
attack on the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] district office 
in Duesseldorf on 5 June and the letter claiming responsibility 
for it. 
  Among the accomplices of the circle of the RAF auxiliary 
troop are reportedly people who reported on the territory around 
the Duesseldorf house of Trust Agency chief Detlev Karsten 
Rohwedder, who was murdered in 1991. The security authorities 
are convinced that there is an international aspect to the 
attack on the CDU office: The "militant leftist autonomous 
group" (that is, according to the letter claiming responsibility 
for the attack) apparently wanted to demonstrate to foreign 
groups that someone is putting up resistance to an imperialist 
policy in the Third World. According to the analysis, the CDU, 
as a government party, will continue to be threatened by attacks 
on a "decentralist basis."

<F P=106> [Report by "Welt-Nachrichtendienst": "Major Gains for PDS </F>
in East"] 
  [Text] Despite losses of up to 3 percent in the four 
municipal elections in eastern Germany, the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU] has remained the strongest party. According to 
initial, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and the 
Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] achieved significant gains. 
Final results are not available from every city yet. 
  In Mecklenburg Western Pomerania and Saxony Anhalt, the CDU 
scored about 33 percent, in Saxony and Thuringia 39 percent. 
The SPD remained in second place, increasing its share between 
6 and 8 percent and achieving 22 (Saxony) and 30 percent. 
  The PDS, the successor party to the Socialist Unity Party of 
Germany, achieved spectacular gains in the east. In Thuringia 
and Saxony it polled 15-16 percent, in Saxony Anhalt and 
Mecklenburg Western Pomerania 20 and 25 percent respectively, 
In several cities it became the strongest party. In Schwerin 
and Rostock, the PDS is now number one with 34 and 33 percent 
respectively. 
  In most major cities in Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia, and 
Saxony, 
run-off elections will have to be held to elect mayors. In 
Hoyerswerda, Magdeburg, Suhl, and Dresden, the PDS took its 
candidates into the second round. 
  In the Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate, and 
Baden-Wuerttemberg, the governing or cogoverning SPD lost votes 
while the CDU increased its share. According to preliminary 
official final results from the Saarland, the SPD's share sank 
from 45.7 to 44.4 percent, while the CDU slightly improved its 
score to 37.4 percent. 
  In Rhineland-Palatinate, where the SPD chancellor candidate 
heads the government in a coalition with the Free Democratic 
Party of Germany [FDP], the SPD suffered severe losses according 
to initial individual results. In the capital, Mainz, it 
dropped from 40.6 to 29.9 percent. In Baden-Wuerttemberg, where 
the final results are not expected before the middle of the week 
due to the complicated electoral system, everything is pointing 
toward an overall CDU victory. 
  The FDP has obviously lost in all seven municipal elections, 
while Alliance 90/Greens increased their share in the vote. 
  In the repetition of the election to the Munich City 
Council, 
the SPD dropped from 42 to 36.1 percent according to first 
trends. The CSU increased its share from 30.1 to 34.3 percent. 
Munich has been ruled by a SPD/Greens majority since 1990. 
However, the vote had to be repeated after the result had been 
challenged.

<F P=106> [Report by Heinz Vielain: "Kanther Regards SPD/Greens </F>
Coalition as Danger for Internal Security"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther, 
of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], is worried "about a 
serious danger to internal security in Germany" if a coalition 
between the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and Greens 
were to take power after the 16 October Bundestag election. 
  "Such a change in government in Bonn would be a high-grade 
security risk," Kanther told WELT AM SONNTAG after the SPD 
obstructed the anticrime law in the Bundesrat, after it had 
passed in the Bundestag. 
  The SPD-led laender refused to pass the "1994 anticrime law" 
in the Bundesrat on Friday [10 June] after it had been adopted 
by the coalition government of the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and the Free Democratic 
Party of Germany [FDP]. Although they welcomed the more severe 
punishment of neo-Nazis as provided for by the draft law, they 
especially reject additional measures to fight crime involving 
international gangs. 
  Minister Kanther gave examples to WELT AM SONNTAG of what, 
according to their election program, the Greens want to enforce 
in a coalition with the SPD. 

  -  "The Greens call for the 
dissolution of the Federal Intelligence Service [BND] and the 
Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], 
because they regard these institutions as a danger to 
democracy." 
  -  "The Greens press for weakening the police. 
Important instruments for fighting crime should be banned, such 
as electronic devices for collecting evidence, the use of 
undercover investigators, and the permission to raid entire 
neighborhoods." 
  -  "Riot police in the laender should be dissolved. 
The Greens also regard the Federal Border Police as 
superfluous." 
  -  "The Greens reject stricter detention laws. 
Instead, the conditions for probation should be extended." 

  Kanther pointed out that common positions were emerging, at 
least between parts of the SPD and the Greens. One case in 
point was the drugs policy: "According to the Greens, trade in 
hashish and marijuana should be legalized, and heroin should 
even be distributed to addicts by the state. The SPD is ready 
to put such trends into practice wherever it assumes power."

<F P=106> [Interview with Wolfgang Thierse, deputy chairman of the </F>
Social Democratic Party of Germany, in the Berlin ORF studio by 
Wolfgang Hochner in the Vienna ORF studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Hochner] Good evening, Mr. Thierse. 
  [Thierse] Good evening. 
  [Hochner] Mr. Thierse, I do not think you will admit that 
the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is in a crisis. But is 
it not a critical situation to lose European elections in an 
election year when Bundestag elections will be held? 
  [Thierse] It certainly is a critical situation, even though 
I would differentiate here. We lost the elections in the west 
rather than in the east, because in the east we won several 
percentage points in the European elections and even more in 
communal elections, where we even won an additional 6-8 percent. 
We should note this difference, which shows that the defeat is 
not the same everywhere. 
  [Hochner] Chancellor candidate Rudolf Scharping has admitted 
that he made mistakes. He has also been accused of keeping the 
party rather disoriented, regarding a possible future coalition, 
for instance. You reportedly would like to see the SPD state 
very clearly that a coalition with the Greens/Alliance 90 should 
be formed. 
  [Thierse] I think we have decided for good reason not to 
conduct an election campaign of coalitions. What we tell the 
citizens -- and I still think this is correct -- is that those 
who want a change of government in Bonn in order to achieve a 
change in policy, must help ensure that the SPD becomes the 
strongest party in the Bundestag. This is the only way to bring 
about a change of government. The voters and the other parties' 
programs will decide with whom we should and could bring about 
such a change in government. I say quite frankly that the 
programmatic closeness between the SPD and the Greens is greater 
than that between the SPD and the Free Democratic Party [FDP], 
which has totally subordinated itself to Helmut Kohl and the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU]. 
  [Hochner] You said the situation in the east was different 
from that in the west. In the east, the Party of Democratic 
Socialism [PDS] has achieved very good results. In East Berlin, 
where the writer Stefan Heym will be your rival, the PDS even 
reached 40 percent. Is there not the danger that, on the one 
hand, you will be worn down between Chancellor Kohl and his CDU, 
and on the other, between the discontented who will then vote 
for the PDS, in particular in the east? 
  [Thierse] The danger is really very great. We must keep in 
mind, however, that this almost incredible result of 40 percent 
in East Berlin is also explained by the fact that the voter 
turnout there was less than 50 percent, which relativizes the 
figure somewhat. But we are in a very difficult situation. We 
are fought by both sides. The CDU is happy about the PDS 
election successes, because they weaken the SPD. 
  The only thing we can do is make clear to the citizens, in a 
very passionate and emotional way, what our alternative to the 
present government policy is, and tell the east Germans that 
east German problems can only be solved within an all-German 
framework or not at all, and not by a party that cultivates 
resentment against west Germans and wants to make such 
resentment the basis of its own party policy success. In the 
final analysis, this will only harm rather than help the east 
Germans. 
  This is a sober and realistic message that we should tell 
the 
people who are furious and disappointed with Kohl's policy and 
the huge economic and social problems of German unity in eastern 
Germany, and who vote for the PDS rather than for a party like 
the SPD which is trying to make feasible suggestions and rejects 
a populist approach. That is why I think we need a much more 
aggressive party and a much more aggressive election campaign, 
which would make the alternatives to Kohl clearer and show that 
the Social Democrats are the only ones to address east German 
interests within an all-German framework. 
  [Hochner] But for such an aggressive election campaign, you 
need an aggressive top candidate. From the Austrian 
perspective, it looks -- excuse me for saying so -- like [Lower 
Saxony Minister President] Gerhard Schroeder would have been the 
right man, whereas Rudolf Scharping certainly is not. 
  [Thierse] We made a truly democratic decision in the SPD, a 
poll among members. The grassroots members made a decision on 
the party chairman and thus also on the chancellor candidate. I 
would consider it political suicide for us to exchange the 
chancellor candidate now. No, I think Rudolf Scharping is 
really doing a good job. It must be clear, however, that the 
SPD does not consist of one candidate only, but of many people. 
It is led by a very resolute and very energetic candidate who 
is in excellent shape. He is not nearly exhausted, he is a very 
great fighter. I am sure of this, I have seen it in recent 
weeks. 
  [Hochner] His opponent, Chancellor Kohl, is of course also a 
very great fighter. 
  [Thierse] Certainly. 
  [Hochner] He is a great fighter who should not be 
underrated. We have the impression that Chancellor Kohl is now 
being carried by the wave of an incipient or imagined economic 
upswing. Could it be that the Germans believe that things are 
improving anyway, and that they could try it again with Helmut 
Kohl this fall? 
  [Thierse] We must look at this very realistically. The 
upswing about which people are talking is a phenomenon of the 
media, because this upswing is not a recovery for all. It does 
not create jobs. Now the CDU, or Helmut Kohl, must discuss this 
recovery for four months, and then the citizens will start 
asking questions. Where is the upswing; will it create a job for 
me or my neighbor? The difference between the euphoria and 
optimism that Helmut Kohl is systematically trying to spread and 
the real situation will become even clearer. But I stress that 
the SPD should not try to conduct the election campaign by 
painting a gloomy picture, but by offering a convincing 
political program that really makes credible suggestions to 
overcome the most important German problem, namely mass 
unemployment, and second, a program by which more social and 
human justice between Germans can be created. I think this is 
the most painful experience for Germans, in particular the east 
Germans -- the experience of injustice regarding the 
distribution of the burdens and advantages of German unity; the 
economic crisis and ways to overcome it. 
  [Hochner] Mr. Thierse, thank you very much for this 
interview.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The SPD Loses Voters to the PDS and </F>
the Greens, the FDP to the CDU"] 
  [Text] A new third force has emerged in German policy -- 
both in the east and in the west. Despite the different course 
of the elections, it is in each case at the expense of the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. The new role is 
shared by Alliance 90/Greens in the west, and the Party of 
Democratic Socialism [PDS] in the east. Unlike the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU], the social democrats also suffered from 
the low voter turnout. This is what the Institute for Applied 
Social Sciences (Infas) says in an analysis ordered by DPA, 
which we publish in the following slightly abridged and edited 
version. 
  At a glance, the trends in east and west seem to diverge -- 
losses here and gains there for the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU]; gains here and losses 
there for the social democrats. The Free Democratic Party [FDP] 
loses little in the west, while it is almost halved in the east. 
Alliance 90/Greens stagnate in the east but have clear gains in 
the west. The CDU can stabilize its dominating position in east 
and west. 
  The FDP was also existentially weakened by the anti-Europe 
party of its former member, Guido Brunner. The 1 percent for 
this party would have raised the FDP above the 5-percent hurdle. 
However, the stream from the FDP to the CDU was larger than 
this movement, namely approximately 400,000 voters net in the 
west. In the east -- compared with the 1990 Bundestag elections 
-- the number was approximately 200,000. 
  Another decisive exchange took place between the SPD and 
Alliance 90/Greens. The largest shifts in the red-green camp 
took place in the large cities and service centers. A total of 
660,000 former SPD voters voted for the ecological party. In 
the east, no more than 11,000 former SPD voters voted for 
Alliance 90/Greens. 
  In the east, the losses of the SPD to the PDS were of 
decisive importance. The net balance was approximately 210,000 
voters, which roughly corresponds to the number of inhabitants 
in Rostock. The losers of German unity -- no matter of what 
persuasion -- voted for the PDS, whereas the winners of German 
unity, having temporarily maintained restraint or even voted for 
other parties, returned to the CDU. Movements from the SPD to 
the PDS were compensated by movements from the CDU to the SPD. 
  Compared with the 1989 European elections, there were gains 
for the CDU/CSU and for Alliance 90/Greens, and losses for the 
social democrats, the liberals, and the Republikaner. 
  The FDP only succeeded in narrowly overcoming the 5-percent 
hurdle in Baden-Wuerttemberg. The Republikaner achieved their 
relatively best results in Bavaria (6.6 percent) and 
Baden-Wuerttemberg (5.9 percent). However, in Bavaria they lost 
no less than 8 percentage points, compared with the 1989 
European elections; of these protest voters of 1989, many did 
not vote this time, and many returned to the CSU. 
  The largest differences in the west manifested themselves in 
the voter turnout. In federal laender where communal elections 
took place at the same time, the turnout was clearly higher than 
the average 59.5 percent, in the northern laender, it was 
equally clearly lower. In the east, too, the voter turnout in 
the laender where communal elections were held simultaneously 
was also higher. In Brandenburg, however, it was only a little 
higher than 40 percent, in Berlin approximately 54 percent, in 
the four other laender, between 65 and 70 percent, comparable to 
the turnout in Baden-Wuerttemberg. 
  In the east, in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and 
Brandenburg, Alliance 90/Greens remained under 5 percent. In 
Mecklenberg-Western Pomerania, the PDS passed the SPD and worked 
its way up to second place; in all the other new laender it 
reached third place. In Brandenburg, it was just 1 percent 
behind the CDU. 
  Compared with the 1990 Bundestag elections, the percentage 
of 
FDP votes was generally halved; in Saxony-Anhalt, it was even 
reduced to one-third. The PDS percentage roughly doubled in all 
new laender. The SPD achieved slight gains (except in 
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania), and the CDU suffered major 
losses. Berlin represents a sort of microcosm that reflects the 
all-German landscape. The combined result from east and west 
shows that the CDU and SPD with 28 percent compete for first 
place, while Alliance 90/Greens and the PDS with 14 and 16 
percent, respectively, compete for third place.

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Hanke: "Operation Deflect Risk"] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Is the pendulum swinging back? 
For about two decades the world financial markets were 
liberalized and deregulated. Banks, insurance companies, and 
brokerage firms were able to extend the limits of their 
activities further and further. But in the interim, supervisory 
bodies and governments have grown increasingly worried. They are 
afraid that the world financial system may have become 
crisis-prone. The concerns focus on the market for new 
speculative financial instruments known as derivatives. 
  Like a bolt out of the blue the U.S. General Acccounting 
Office [GAO] issued a set of demands last week which ran into 
the opposition of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and 
the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC], however. Still, 
the examiners who are looking into futures, swaps, and options 
at the request of several Congressional committees are now 
pressing for wide-ranging new regulations and taking aim at the 
heart of the financial innovations of the eighties in the 
process. [passage omitted] 
  The Americans are not so much worried about the explosion of 
the derivatives trade, as such, as about the fact that 90 
percent of that trade is concentrated on just seven banks and 
five brokerage firms. "If one of these large dealers goes 
bankrupt," the GAO noted, "it could endanger other firms, 
including those which are part of the U.S. deposit insurance 
system and, ultimately, the financial system as a whole." In 
view of the fact that the American taxpayer has already had to 
come up with several hundred billion dollars to pay for the 
collapse of the savings and loan industry, the GAO report went 
on to say, the government may be threatened with yet another 
drain on its resources in case of a derivatives crisis. 
  The Bundesbank has similar concerns. It is not opposed to 
the 
new instruments in principle but it would like to "keep the 
risks involved in these trades from becoming a matter for the 
government to deal with," says Edgar Meister, who heads the 
Bundesbank's division of banks and regulatory activities. What 
Meister is saying is that the Bundesbank would be forced to prop 
up the financial system by pumping in large sums of money in the 
event of a major derivatives crisis. 
  As part of the fifth amendment to the German credit industry 
law, which is presently being considered, the Bundesbank wants 
the banks to report their derivatives risks and their contract 
partners to the Bundesbank from now on just as they report 
normal major credits. This would provide the Bundesbank with 
information on the magnitude of the risks incurred by individual 
banks and on what firms are involved to what extent in the new 
market. 
  The boom, at any rate, is quite formidable. At present, 
there 
are derivatives with a face value of 3,579 billion German marks 
[DM] in circulation. According to banking industry estimates 
this represents credit risks amounting to DM115 billion. 
  Up to now, the Association of German Banks has been firmly 
opposed to the expanded reporting requirement because it is 
afraid that this will lead to increased costs for its member 
institutions. For some time now German credit institutions and 
insurance companies have had to maintain certain reserves 
against the possibility that their contract partners fail to 
meet their obligations. From now on the actual market risks are 
going to have to be secured with the banks' own capital. In 
other words, the banks will have to protect themselves better 
against the worst case scenario of derivatives becoming 
worthless. 
  This really amounts to a blow at the banks' very resources. 
"For us it would be the worst case scenario," the director of a 
major bank says, "if the security deposits would make our 
derivatives business too expensive." The banks not only make a 
profit on their own speculation with swaps, futures, and 
options, but, above all, by trading these instruments. Such 
trades are attractive because the spread between the purchase 
and selling price is four to eight times as large as in the case 
of traditional securities. But if they would now have to put 
more of their own capital on the line, their profits would melt 
away. 
  This is why the banks would prefer to calculate risk 
according to their own concepts, but the Bundesbank's Meister is 
firmly opposed to such an approach. "In the absence of minimal 
standards," he says, "we would reach a point where the banks 
would all be protected in completely different ways." The 
experts of the Basel Bank for International Settlements, the 
parent organization of all the large national banks, agree. 
  The GAO report provides greater impetus to these efforts. 
"The United States should continue to play a leading role in the 
efforts aimed at harmonizing the international regulation of 
financial activities, including derivatives," the report 
emphatically states. The GAO categorically states that all those 
who deal in futures and options must have adequate capital 
resources to cover their activities and calls on the U.S. 
Congress to make this part of a new and rigid regulatory code. 
Congress should make dealers who have operated without any 
restrictions up to now accountable to the SEC, which is 
considered to be particularly strict. American derivatives 
traders have reacted to this demand with cries of outrage. 
  The GAO also calls for uniform accounting rules for 
derivatives and a far-reaching requirement to provide 
information on contract partners, outstanding amounts and 
profits from derivatives. In addition, not only derivatives 
traders but end consumers of derivatives should be required to 
establish an airtight internal control and reporting system. 
  Both the Bundesbank and the Berlin Credit Supervision 
Authority agree with a good many of these ideas. A joint task 
force is already trying to work out the exact requirements for 
the banks' internal control systems. The major German banking 
institutions themselves do agree that the traders should be 
under the internal control of individuals who operate on a 
functionally separate basis from them. One of the financial 
experts in the ministry of finance disagrees. "For that kind of 
job," he says, "you need people who are just as good as the 
derivatives traders themselves--but they would earn only 
one-half as much money." London derivatives dealers earn more 
than DM300,000 a year; those in Frankfurt earn a little less. 
Their exceptional knowledge of mathematics and statistics are 
well remunerated. 
  The banks mollify the controllers by saying that the trade 
volume in the billions only represents nominal amounts while a 
mere three or four percent of the total is really at risk and 
most of that is secured by reciprocal deals. "By and large," 
says Alexander von Ungern-Sternberg, director of the treasury 
division of Deutsche Bank, "we are playing a zero-sum game." In 
other words: contracts which are targeted to take advantage of 
rising stock prices are secured by contrasting deals. 
  To be sure, it is often impossible to strike such a balance. 
And it is also unclear to what an extent those involved really 
do pursue such a defensive strategy. At any rate, it cannot 
overcome another problem. "Banks know their own partners but not 
their partners' partners because those are not subject to 
control in view of the fact that they are not banks themselves," 
says Axel Bertuch-Samuels of the Association of German Savings 
Banks. This can lead to unpleasant surprises, as in the case of 
the Metallgesellschaft. Nor would one have thought that Procter 
and Gamble, the conservative detergent manufacturer, would 
squander $100 million on diff swaps. 
  Such losses do not push the world financial system to the 
brink of collapse, of course. But if a major bad speculation 
creates problems for a major banking institution the resulting 
crisis might quickly spread. Which is why the overseers are more 
than ever resolved to act. The heads of the national banks of 
the 10 largest industrial nations have been asked to work out 
proposals for reregulation to submit to the annual meeting of 
the IMF and the World Bank this fall.

<F P=106> [Report by "ank.": "German Trade Union Federation Calls For </F>
Change in Economic Policy"] 
  [Text] Berlin, 13 June -- With the annual report of the 
presidium, the 15th federal congress of the German Trade Union 
Federation (DGB) was opened in Berlin on 13 June. Deputy DGB 
Chairperson Ursula Engelen-Kefer, who also presented the report 
on behalf of the late chairman, Heinz-Werner Meyer, called for a 
"change in economic policy" of the Federal Government. She said 
full employment had to become the main goal again. The number 
of unemployed this year would increase to half a million this 
year, the deputy chairperson predicted. In view of these 
figures, there was no reason for the government to "demonstrate 
official euphoria" about economic recovery. Mrs. Engelen-Kefer 
called such an optimistic assessment an "obvious tactical 
preelection maneuver." She added that politicians only started 
talking about economic recovery when the new pay settlements, 
which had been described everywhere as moderate, were concluded. 
  According to Mrs. Engelen-Kefer, the DGB is seeing the 
social 
welfare state in danger. Following the defeat of real 
socialism, the threshold at which people are reluctant to attack 
core elements of the social market economy had decreased. The 
DGB official mentioned as examples the abolition of bad water 
allowances for construction workers, the introduction of private 
employment offices, and the admission of sub-standard wages. 
She blamed the Federal Government's "reckless privatization 
campaign" for this development. Neither regulation nor 
deregulation should become a dogma. By the Federal Government's 
"campaign" for more part-time employment, the government had 
also recognized now that shorter, not longer, working hours 
would be a means to combat unemployment. However, most employees 
were hardly able to renounce a substantial part of their incomes 
in connection with part-time work. Nor would the DGB accept an 
increase in part-time employment conditions that did not 
envisage any social insurance, said Mrs. Engelen-Kefer. 
  At the DGB congress, a reform of German trade unions will be 
the most important topic. Mrs. Engelen-Kefer told the 600 trade 
union delegates that it was urgently necessary to strengthen the 
DGB's competence. However, she also warned them about getting 
involved in a crisis scenario. The trade unions should defend 
themselves against a "public campaign." She said: "Neither do 
we have a mass exodus of members, nor are we a toothless tiger." 
Mrs. Engelen- Kefer disputed a DGB budget deficit. However, 
she admitted there were "financial problems" and an "alarming" 
decline in the number of members by 1.5 million since 1992. 
Presidium member Teitzel, who is in charge of finances, also 
disputed a DGB budget deficit. He said the budget of the 
current year was balanced, and there was no need to draw on 
trade union assets. The profit and loss account of last year 
was balanced and would show a "minor surplus." 
  CDU politician Fink, who is also a deputy DGB chairman, 
called for "work for all." According to Fink, the pay 
settlements this year have shown that trade unions not only 
talked about, but also practiced, solidarity. However, Fink 
warned about always presenting the United States as a model for 
a functioning labor market. He said that in the United States, 
many workers' incomes were below the poverty line. 
International change would only be decided by the importance a 
country gave education and research, said Fink with reference to 
U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich. 
  This Tuesday [14 June], the DGB congress will select a 
successor to Heinz-Werner Meyer. The only candidate is IG 
Metall Metal Workers Union Presidium member Dieter Schulte. 
Mrs. Engelen-Kefer is once again running candidate for deputy 
chairperson. There will be no other deputy in the future. Fink 
is not running. He said it should still be possible in a unity 
trade union to be an employee, a trade unionist, and a member of 
the Christian Democratic Union. The Association of Christian 
Democratic Employees (CDA) will, in the future, presumably only 
be represented in the DGB Presidium by Mrs. Goerner. The 
Presidium will be reduced from eight to five members.

<F P=106> [Report signed by "old.": "Medium-Sized Industry Waiting </F>
for Debt Agreement With Russia"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- The Committee for Trade With the East of 
German business and industry intends to bring about, as soon as 
possible, a financial arrangement for German companies whose 
deliveries to Russia are not covered by Hermes [credit insurance 
company] export guarantees of the Federal Government. This is 
what Karl-Hermann Fink, the manager of the committee, said at a 
conference on financial and advisory assistance for East Europe. 
  According to Fink, 400 firms are involved with unsecured 
claims totaling 700 million German marks [DM]. Roughly half of 
them are medium-sized companies, for which a satisfactory 
arrangement with Russia is of existential importance. Fink 
admitted, however, that the negotiations with Russia, which will 
be resumed no later than the middle of next month, are 
difficult. In some cases, the Russians suggested separate 
options and wanted to make down payments to the German companies 
concerned. However, this was not desirable from the German 
point of view. Fink said a comprehensive option had to be found. 
  According to Otto Wolff von Amerongen, chairman of the 
Committee for Trade with the East, above all realistic financial 
concepts for trade with the East European states had to be 
developed. "Otherwise, we will have a bottomless pit," 
Amerongen said. Basically, the task was also to finance 
projects through close cooperation between banks and industry, 
he said. In addition, barter deals would serve as complementary 
instruments. 
  Approximately 200 industry and policy representatives took 
part in the conference, which was sponsored by Berlin Governing 
Mayor Eberhard Diepgen. The participants primarily discussed 
the question of to what extent the activities of the private 
sector could be connected more closely with public financial aid 
for the reconstruction of East Europe. 
  According to Board Chairman Manfred Gentz of Daimler-Benz 
InterServices (Debis) AG, Berlin, there are still fractional 
losses between private banks and the banks of the European 
Community. In addition, bureaucratic obstacles in the East 
European countries have to be eliminated, he said. 
  According to Gentz, the opening of Western markets is one of 
the most important conditions for a successful transformation of 
the system in Central and East Europe. "The West must 
contribute its share to create, over the long term, the 
desirable political, economic, and social conditions," said 
Gentz, who is also chairman of the working group dealing with 
"general financing and consultation problems as well as problems 
concerning contracts" in the Committee for Trade With the East. 
German industry and the Committee for Trade With the East 
advocate in particular the association of Central and East 
Europe with the European Union. 
  For the German national economy, the East European neighbors 
already play an important role today. For all the problems, 
their weight will increase, said Gentz. With DM43 billion, more 
than 7 percent of German exports went to the East European 
region in 1993, while almost 7 percent of German imports also 
came from East Europe, accounting for DM36 million. 
  The most important trading partner is Russia, closely 
followed by Poland. German exports to Poland alone accounted 
for DM9.7 billion last year; they were thus higher than exports 
to China, the Asian country which is marked by an "economic 
miracle." Last year, 10 percent of the overall German direct 
investment was made in East Europe -- compared with just 1 
percent in 1990. East Europe was the only region in the world 
where new German investment increased in recent years. An 
important motor in this respect was opening up of market and 
utilizing the considerable wage and production cost advantages. 
  According to Gentz, tying in the young market economies and 
utilizing their wage cost advantages will also increase German 
competitiveness. "Our response to NAFTA and ASEAN could be 
close cooperation with East Europe," said Gentz. 
  In the scope of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit, the 
Committee for Trade With the East organized a meeting between 
the Russian leadership and German business and industry 
representatives in which the strategic modernization of the 
Russian national economy was discussed. Some pilot projects 
were suggested. Specifically, the projects include the 
modernization of conventional power plants and the more 
effective utilization of Siberian natural gas resources.

<F P=106> [Article by Josef Abaffy: "More Flexible, But Incomplete"] </F>
  [Text] Economics Minister Rexrodt is quite right in saying 
that the new government guidelines on Hermes credits demonstrate 
both flexibility and common sense. But this new flexibility is 
only one side of the coin: the new regulations are also an 
expression of a certain fearfulness. It so happens that the new 
flexibility in covering export credit risks does not resolve the 
fundamental problem faced by the system which is operating with 
losses running into the billions. In principle, the export 
credit system should break even. If it does not, it needs to be 
subsidized, the GATT principles state; but that represents a 
distortion of the competitive system, i.e. it is illegal. 
  The classification of the laender into risk categories on 
the 
basis of which credit risk guarantees are set by the government 
is a step in the right direction. As against the previous 
practice of setting "uniform rates" reliable payment and 
customer ethics are rewarded based on the principle of "higher 
premiums for greater risks and lower premiums for smaller 
risks," while poor performance is penalized by charging higher 
premiums or even by refusing to extend subsequent coverage. 
  But the other side of the coin becomes apparent soon enough. 
Russia, for example (or rather, customers in Russia) is in class 
five, without a doubt a poor payer of its bills. Last year, the 
German Government was forced to pay 5.1 billion German marks 
[DM] because Russian customers did not pay their bills. It is 
doubtful that this will change in the next few years. Even 
Rexrodt knows--and makes no secret of it--that the assumption of 
risks in trading with Russia is based on political 
considerations and not on business decisions. 
  In line with the logic of the new flexibility, however, 
German exporters looking for credit guarantees for their 
business dealings with Russian customers would have to pay 
premiums of more than 50 percent because the risk of losses is 
as great as it is and because the risk is no longer supposed to 
be shared by all exporters on an equal basis. But premiums of 
such magnitude would quickly put an end to all export trade. 
This problem arises with respect to all the major problem 
nations of years past, e.g. the former Soviet bloc, Iran, 
Brazil, or Argentina. 
  One more time Rexrodt weasled out of the problem of who must 
bear the economic risks for business deals with politically 
significant countries such as Russia or Iran, which are either 
unable or unwilling to pay up. Either the risk guarantees are no 
longer extended in which case such exports will no longer take 
place and the Bonn government will only assume "good," i.e. 
minor risks, or the government will guarantee political credit 
risks but does not make the exporters pay for them no matter 
what Germany's OECD or GATT partners may say. As long as this 
central problem of political risks is not resolved it cannot be 
maintained that the new guidelines will lead to a reduction of 
the Hermes-related budget risks. 
  But if the government merely assumes "good" risks from now 
on, we may not need a risk insurance for export credits any 
more. Even now only about six percent of all exports are 
Hermes-insured. 
  There is one more thing wrong with the new Hermes system, 
i.e. it is hard to see why the ministry chooses to keep the 
laender list a secret. On the face of it, this is simply the way 
bureaucrats work who view the public as a nuisance while 
forgetting all the while that it is the public that pays their 
salaries. 
  Rexrodt's explanation of the bureaucratic foolishness is 
unconvincing. The lists cannot be made public, he says, because 
they must continuously be updated. Actually, it is the other way 
around: precisely because they are constantly updated they need 
to be made public so that the exporters can make proper plans. 
It goes without saying that the Foreign Ministry may run into 
problems if country A or country B is listed in a less than 
attractive category; but that is a matter to be dealt with not 
by the exporter but by the country in question. For their part, 
the ministry officials should have the courage to break down and 
realize that they are here to provide a service.

<F P=106> [Report signed "D.Gd.": "Defense Budget Likely To Be Cut By </F>
2.5 Billion Francs"] 
  [Text] Not so long ago, Defense Minister Leotard thought it 
appropriate to confirm that the government had resolutely 
decided to break "with the habit" of the Socialists "to 
systematically amputate the Armed Forces' arms budget." He will 
have to reconsider this statement. His 1994 budget, which was 
already cut by 630 million francs [Fr] in March, may be reduced 
by another Fr2.5 billion. In a statement to the Assembly's 
Finance Commission, Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy announced 
that this amount would be frozen. Jacques Boyon, the RPR [Rally 
for the Republic] chairman of the defense committee, was quite 
upset about this yesterday and wrote a letter to [Prime 
Minister] Eduard Balladur seeking "guarantees for the gradual 
release of these frozen funds so that deadlines with regard to 
weapons programs can be adhered to." If the Fr2.5 billion cut 
is approved, which is highly probable, it will come from the 
Armed Forces arms budget. The issue comes at an inconvenient 
moment for Francois Leotard, who is defending the 1995-2000 
Military Programming Law before the Senate today. This law 
provides for an annual 0.5-percent budget increase, which is an 
exception, in theory and in the name of the national defense 
effort, to the five-year law on the limiting public spending.

<F P=106> [Report by Sophie Roquelle and Christine Lagoutte: </F>
"Economic Situation -- Balladur: `A Plan for the Next Six 
Months'"] 
  [Text] The day after the disappointing performance by the 
RPR-UDF [Rally for the Republic-French Democratic Union] 
majority's list in the European elections, Edouard Balladur 
intends to seize back the initiative. On a visit to Lille, the 
prime minister announced that, within two weeks, he would be 
presenting a "plan of action for the next six months" with a 
view to "stepping up the effort to boost economic recovery in 
the country." 
  Unlike the January plan aimed at boosting consumption, which 
was preceded by several interministerial meetings, it would 
appear that the prime minister's office has not prepared a new 
catalog of measures in consultation with the various ministers. 
This time, the message is essentially a political one. Edouard 
Balladur will set a date "on the major topics to be decided on 
this autumn," explained someone from his entourage. For him 
there can be no question of allowing the result of the European 
elections to disrupt his own political agenda and lead anyone to 
think that his government is rejecting any reforms. 
  These major topics, he said, concern "youth, health 
insurance, the fight against the budget deficit, the choice to 
be made between lowering taxes and social security charges," 
just to cite economic and social issues. 
<H5>  Better Targeting </H5>
  Will the government adopt new measures aimed at recovery? 
Nothing could be less certain given the strong budgetary 
constraints in force. Furthermore, people at the Economics 
Ministry say that recent surveys on the state of the economy 
conducted among company bosses and households demonstrate a very 
clear-cut boost in confidence. Moreover, it was emphasized that 
the result of the last study, carried out last week by the INSEE 
[National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies] and 
focusing on households, was "excellent." 
  The fact remains that the success of the "scrap premium" 
adopted in January in an attempt to relaunch the automotive 
industry is leaving some people rather envious. There are many 
sectors serving a large consumer market, such as clothing, 
toys, or furniture, that would like to benefit in turn from a 
nudge in the right direction. Consequently, the CLIMO (Liaison 
Committee for Manpower Industries), which represents more than 1 
million jobs, is asking for "better targeting of back-to-school 
grants" for September. Moreover, it wants employee ownership 
of companies to be encouraged in order to stimulate consumer 
spending, as was done in the automobile and housing sectors last 
January. Yesterday, Edouard Balladur contented himself with 
making a gesture in the direction of the textile and clothing 
industries. He confirmed a program aimed at helping companies 
in this sector to develop foreign markets and promote their 
products. However, the textile and clothing sector is seeing 
two further demands remain unfulfilled, namely the demand that 
work hours be calculated on an annual basis and, more 
importantly, that social security taxes be reduced. 
  While hailing France's foreign trade performance last year, 
which "enabled us to preserve 100,000 jobs," Edouard Balladur 
has found a new "carrot" aimed at encouraging companies to hire 
more workers. Accordingly, he announced a new measure according 
to which small- and medium-sized companies which recruit an 
employee in an "export" department will receive a cash advance 
from the COFACE [French Insurance Company for External Trade]. 
This advance will amount to 260,000 French francs [Fr] for 
companies with a turnover under Fr300 million, and Fr300,000 for 
those with sales totaling between Fr300 million and Fr3 billion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Industry Minister Gerard Longuet by </F>
Pierre-Angel Gay, Philippe Labarde, Michel Noblecourt, and 
Roland-Pierre Paringaux; place and date not given: "An 
Interview With Gerard Longuet"] 
  [Excerpt] [LE MONDE] The high technology which we are 
exporting represents few jobs, and the consumer products which 
we are importing destroy many. Isn't the 80 billion-franc [Fr] 
trade surplus a Pyrrhic victory? 
  [Longuet] No, it is a genuine victory. A true performance. 
These results (Fr1,300 billion of exports, Fr87 billion surplus 
in 1993, and already more than Fr15 billion for the first 
quarter of 1994) point to the high level of competitiveness 
achieved by our industry. Because exports are above all 
products, technology, and hence industrial activity. It is 
because we need to export that I condemn the myth of the 
post-industrial society. 
  It is true that an employee in the clothing, footwear, and 
toy sectors frequently produces under Fr500,000 a year in 
turnover, a figure which is doubled by the high-technology 
sectors. This means that the structure of our exports is not 
the most favorable for employment. But it corresponds to 
international specialization. It boosts our industrial 
competitiveness. It creates jobs in the service sector. 
Overall, it helps improve our standard of living. 
  Rebalancing between the various sectors is done through 
taxation and social contributions. This is why we are able to 
retain labor-intensive industries. As a liberal, I would prefer 
this rebalancing to take place via consumption and prices. But 
France is not just a market, it is also, and especially, a 
community. In this way Toulouse is benefiting from worldwide 
success of Airbus, but close by, we are trying to preserve the 
textile industry at Mazamet and the clothing industry at Ariege. 
  [LE MONDE] How does one facilitate these transfers? 
  [Longuet] Today, everything points to the fact that job 
creation is blocked by excessive social security taxes. The 
basic level of these contributions was decided during a period 
of labor shortage, whereas, for the last 10 or 15 years, we have 
been experiencing a job shortage. We must therefore change 
policy. We must demand less of producers and more from 
consumers, less from businesses and more from the citizen, less 
in terms of social security and more from taxes. [Former 
Socialist Prime Minister] Michel Rocard's government had begun 
to do this with the CSG [General Social Contribution], and we 
are continuing on this path. 
  It is this truth which underlies the introduction of a 
"social VAT [value-added tax]." But this project is both 
limited and in part unjust. Limited, because increasing VAT by 
1.5 points -- the maximum possible -- would bring in no more 
than Fr40 billion. In part unjust, because a tax on consumption 
is certainly the least courageous and has the least 
redistributive effect. Rather, what we need is for French 
people to be made increasingly responsible for the cost of 
social benefits. We need to create capitalization-based pension 
systems to supplement distribution schemes, and a more 
economical health care system. 
  [LE MONDE] How do you reply to Philippe de Villiers [head of 
the "Other Europe" European election list] when he promotes the 
closing of borders to a certain extent? 
  [Longuet] That he is wrong! We live in a world in which 
ideas, people, goods, and capital can freely move. This 
progress explains the doubling of our living standard since the 
Treaty of Rome [was signed in 1957]. The higher a product's 
added value, the more global its market. What domestic market 
could justify Airbus, the TGV [high-speed train], or even the 
pharmaceutical industry? 
  What is the truth about our foreign trade? We have a trade 
deficit with the major industrialized countries and a surplus 
with most of the newly industrialized and developing nations. 
We have a deficit with the United States, Japan, and Germany, 
that is with countries with standards of living and levels of 
technology which are comparable to our own. We have a surplus 
with the rapidly expanding newly industrialized countries, 
which, admittedly, sell us consumer goods, but which purchase 
the capital goods in which we specialize: energy, transport, and 
telecommunications equipment. For us to be rich, our partners 
need to be rich. To be able to sell to them, we also need to 
buy from them. 
  [LE MONDE] After the signing of the GATT agreement at 
Marrakesh, you made the threatened labor-intensive industries 
one of your priorities. How are you proceeding with this? 
  [Longuet] I am fighting to have the World Trade Organization 
include a "social clause" based on three parameters: a ban on 
work by children of school age; a ban on unpaid forced labor, 
i.e., that of prisoners; and the freedom to join trade unions 
and to engage in wage negotiations. 
  [LE MONDE] Is not the latter condition a form of 
protectionism? 
  [Longuet] We are fully aware that, in many cases, the sole 
advantage of a poor country with no industrial or commercial 
capacity is its low salary levels. But when these countries 
develop and earn money, we would like to see this distributed 
equitably and passed on to the employees so that they too can 
become consumers and, why not, consumers of our products. Let 
us take India as an example. In this country with nearly 1 
billion inhabitants, 100 million perhaps are already world 
market consumers. We are asking India to open up its market to 
us if it wants France, in return, to open up its borders. This 
is what all the discussion of the dismantling of the Multifiber 
Agreeement is about. 
  In the global economy, the major industrial powers who 
control technology, capital, and the major markets also set the 
rules for world trade. These are the major democracies. It is 
they who supply the capital which the developing countries need. 
Capital which requires legal stability and social peace in 
those places where it is invested. Countries which wish to take 
part in world trade will inevitably have to develop toward 
systems based on the rule of law and, I hope, toward democracy.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Philippe Reinhard] </F>
  [Text] The first estimates available yesterday at 2200 
hours based on initial tallies seem to point to a major 
political change. Within the majority, the list led by Dominique 
Baudis comes in first. However, it definitely falls short of 
achieving its goal as a "union" list, since it seems to have 
done less well than Valery Giscard d'Estaing's list in 1989. 
And, above all, Philippe de Villiers wins his gamble: There is 
indeed a place for him at the fringes of the majority. Should 
final tallies also confirm that his list ("The Other Europe") 
outstrips [National Front leader] Le Pen's, it would become 
impossible to ignore Mr. de Villiers in the run-up to the 
impending [1995] presidential election. The majority still must 
pay for relegating Jean-Francois Deniau to the sidelines. 
  Not that this paradoxical result should be a hindrance for 
right-wing presidential contenders. Neither [Prime Minister] 
Edouard Balladur nor [Rally for the Republic (RPR) President] 
Jacques Chirac have condemned Mr. de Villiers' behavior, even 
though the RPR's two virtual candidates did not go as far as 
Messrs. Pons and [Interior Minister] Pasqua in encouraging the 
dissident. 
  This morning, Mr. de Villiers' results have settled the 
question as to whether or not he belongs to the majority. Some 
may now realize, albeit belatedly, that his performance may drag 
the majority further to the right than would be necessary to 
ensure victory for one of its members in 1995. 
  However, the major event is to be found within the Left. 
[Socialist Party (PS) Secretary General] Michel Rocard is doing 
only slightly better than Bernard Tapie [Left Radical Movement]. 
The failure of his "little big bang" tactics is so plain that 
he can obviously no longer be the PS presidential candidate. 
That is, unless Socialist leaders choose to stick to the rule: 
"One does not change a losing team." Nevertheless, since 
Bernard Tapie, despite all his difficulties, managed to snap at 
Michel Rocard's heels in such a decisive manner, the verdict is 
clear: Mr. Rocard is now out of the running. 
  There will be time tomorrow to scrutinize results and 
compare 
them with those of our neighbors, since, after all, this was a 
European election. For the future, on a European scale, this 
election is fraught with information. But as far as France is 
concerned, and here all that matters from now on is the 
presidential election, the 12 June election has drastically 
simplified the issue for the Left by eliminating Rocard, while 
in return it has contributed to complicating things for the 
Right, except for Philippe de Villiers...and Charles Pasqua.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Paul Guilbert: "Majority and Opposition in </F>
Search of a Strategy"] 
  [Text] There is symmetry on the surface only. True, the 
blow is severe both on the Left and on the Right; the emergence 
of a force that claims over 12 percent of votes is not to be 
taken lightly. Tapie and De Villiers cannot be ignored, and 
their presence is made all the more clangorous by the fuzziness 
of the policies they stand for. However, while Tapie is 
snapping at the heels of the PS [Socialist Party] leader [Michel 
Rocard], being outdistanced by the latter by less than 3 
percentage points, De Villiers has only gone half the distance, 
as it were, covered by the leader of the RPR-UDF [Rally for the 
Republic-French Democratic Union] list. Therefore, the Left is 
becoming truly fragmented, while the Right is merely divided. 
  As for Europe, the stands taken by the newcomers are 
completely opposite: Tapie is a staunch defender of federalism, 
while de Villiers demands nothing less than the elimination of 
the "pernicious" Maastricht Treaty. Should we compare their 
moral behavior? While the latter calls for a crusade for 
"values," an acknowledged component of his success, the scandals 
surrounding the former demonstrate that his electorate is hardly 
concerned with integrity: It is as though this was not an issue 
at all. 
  As for the "populist" tag they have often been saddled with, 
it does not appear to have been taken seriously: Indeed, it 
hardly explains anything. Are they populists, those people who 
wanted to vote for the majority but who were intent on 
confirming their radical rejection of the Maastricht Treaty 
without giving their vote to [National Front leader] Le Pen, 
whose list stagnated? Are they populists, those who previously 
voted for Mitterrand or those young people who, because they can 
no longer identify with the PS, favor either more left-wing 
lists or vote for [Mr. Tapie's] "Radical Energy" list in 
southern regions which traditionally favored a moderate brand of 
Socialism? 
  Both on the Left and the Right, there is something else 
which 
counterbalanced the "useful vote" notion which Rocard and Baudis 
had been betting on, in an election with no immediate or 
tangible political usefulness. A protest vote, no doubt, 
stemming from a craving for a new rhetoric, for some intensity 
of conviction. As far as the European framework is concerned, 
let us listen to Alain Juppe: "The French do not understand the 
integration of Europe as it stands," as well as the prime 
minister, starkly noting that the public is "preoccupied." 
<H5>  Shattered </H5>
  What to do? And what will the two troublemakers do? The 
disruption is such that presidential election strategies will 
have to be revised or at least postponed, be it only to take the 
time to comprehend the new phenomena. How simple a situation it 
was in which Rocard used to be the obvious candidate of the 
Left, while right-wing candidates, certain they would beat him, 
only had to take the measure of their attractiveness or 
repulsion! 
  The first effect of Bernard Tapie's victory was to shatter 
the obviousness of Rocard's candidacy. "What we need, is a 
Mitterrand," Tapie said. This statement had a devastating 
effect, intended to open up the game without it going any 
further. True, Rocard had favored a strategy based on 
alliances, first between the PS' various factions, then beyond 
them, in a last-ditch attempt which failed to offer anything new 
with respect to society, his party, or even his own presidential 
ambitions. His electoral rout gives further confirmation that 
we are confronted with an empty shell. The triumph of the 
energetic, dynamic, vibrant Bernard Tapie -- all characteristics 
not associated with Michel Rocard -- forces the PS leader into 
self-criticism: He lacked "boldness" in his style and his 
choice of objectives. Back to square one, in other words. 
  PS leaders have now ended their silence and, without 
censuring Rocard, seem to tell him that politics is way too 
serious a matter to be left in the hands of a single man, even 
if this man is the agreed candidate, or an excessively elitist 
team. The way the Socialists are dealing with the concerns of 
the French population, be they unemployment or Europe, must be 
defined through a general debate. This is the approach favored 
by Jospin, for instance. We will witness a return of political 
tradition, the choice of the presidential candidate being 
deferred for the time being. This is a way of playing for time 
while avoiding personality issues as much as possible. 
  Shall we witness among the Right the same recourse to the 
various political groups, the same recognition of their rights, 
either to shape a platform, to choose the presidential 
candidate, or to engage in a process of planning strategy? 
True, the political parties hardly had a say in the European 
campaign, their views being made subordinate, not to say being 
abandoned, for the sake of unity. 
  This principle of unity, freely scorned by the talented and 
dissident De Villiers list, did not bring the expected results. 
What exactly does de Villiers mean, aside from the fact that he 
occupies [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua's spot on the 
political spectrum or that he operates in the margins of [RPR 
leader] Jacques Chirac's domain, and that, like them, he does 
not offer a broad alternative European platform such as that 
recommended by [Assembly Speaker] Philippe Seguin, for instance? 
However, his is a force that categorically rejects the 
government's European policy while being part of the majority, 
and which demands to be heard without saying (nor knowing?) what 
its stipulations will be. 
<H5>  Playing for Time </H5>
  Does Edouard Balladur's axiom -- "United we stand, divided 
we 
fall" -- retain all of the formal relevance it had before the 
election? Already, RPR Secretary General Alain Juppe, 
condemning Pasqua for supporting de Villiers, is wondering aloud 
whether it would not have been preferable to "compete with one 
candidate for each political family," since the single list 
strategy, including in a presidential election, "favors 
dissenting voices." This is exactly the opinion of Charles 
Millon, the president of the UDF caucus in the National 
Assembly, when he suggests that the RPR and the UDF should enter 
into a "contract" of conduct. 
  Meanwhile, Chirac, who is in Bayeux today together with 
Balladur for a strictly Gaullist commemoration (the arrival of 
General de Gaulle on French soil on 14 June 1944), keeps silent. 
So does [former president] Giscard d'Estaing. For all of them, 
what matters now is playing for time.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jean Bothorel: "A Lesson for the </F>
Presidential Election"] 
  [Text] For a some 20 years now, the discrepancy between 
partisan struggles and the real concerns of the French has been 
a recurring theme at every election. 
  In yesterday's European elections, this theme dominated 
everything else. And the results, which could be likened to a 
thunderbolt, at the very least bear witness to this discrepancy 
which affects the very core of our democracy. To be sure, one 
can seek comfort in the belief that this election was but a way 
for voters to release some steam. 
  However, European elections have always provided a good 
snapshot of national voting trends. A nationwide proportional 
ballot, such an election is probably as reliable as any opinion 
poll. One would be mistaken to dismiss them as an 
inconsequential. 
  There will be power shifts within the Right -- the UDF 
[French Democratic Union], RPR [Rally for the Republic], and 
National Front -- as a result of the election. During the 
campaign, it appeared clearly that the stage for the 
presidential election was being set, albeit in a covert manner: 
For potential contenders for the top job (Messrs. Chirac, 
Balladur, and Giscard d'Estaing, among others), supporting the 
UDF-RPR list was a mostly risk-free way of staking their claim. 
All of them went all out in their support for the majority 
list. Valery Giscard d'Estaing, whom no one can suspect of 
indecisiveness or incompetence in this area, was especially 
active; in particular he was the only one among the majority's 
main leaders to battle it out on television. His debate with 
[Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard on 8 June was 
his first televised duel since he last locked horns with 
Francois Mitterrand on 5 May 1981. However, the mediocre 
performance of the RPR-UDF list cannot be blamed on the former 
president of the Republic, nor on the prime minister or the 
Paris mayor. Truth be told, list leaders made too many 
mistakes, and they lacked ardor. In fact, the main lesson to be 
derived from this election is not so much the performance of the 
RPR-UDF list as the distribution of the votes among the three 
lists (Baudis, de Villiers, and Le Pen), on the one hand, and 
the abstention rate, on the other. 
  Ten months before the presidential election, Europe was 
prone 
to a double risk: first of all, the risk of indifference, 
demonstrated by a high abstention rate; second, the risk of 
fierce opposition, reflected in the results of the de Villiers 
and Le Pen lists on the Right, and the Chevenement, Wurtz, and 
Laguiller lists on the Left. 
  Given the 45-percent abstention rate, which remains high 
even 
though it is lower than that of 1989, and given the results of 
the de Villiers, Le Pen, Chevenement, Wurtz, Laguiller, and 
"Chasse-Peche" [hunters and fishermen] lists, this double risk 
has been confirmed. Presidential contenders will not be able to 
ignore such a negative reaction with respect to Europe. This is 
not only true for Michel Rocard, who moreover has to worry about 
Mr. Tapie, but also for the future UDF or RPR candidate or 
candidates. Indeed, this rejection hinges on a widespread 
resistance and aversion among the electorate of the 
parliamentary Right. Being against Europe also means being 
against technocracy, immigrant workers, the free flow of goods 
and people at the borders, etc. 
  An "anti" and angry rhetoric has been gaining ground among 
right-wing voters, leading them somewhat away from the liberal 
model. 
  Such rhetoric, such negative reflexes are a reflection of 
all 
the fears and distress of the times. 
  Will future RPR or UDF candidates know how to thwart this 
trend? Will they be able to? They should not underestimate such 
trends which some people call "populism," "nationalism," or even 
"fascism," and nor should they believe that the old Right-Left 
divide will necessarily be revived at the time of the 
presidential election. There is no hard evidence that the 
so-called stray sheep who voted for de Villiers or Le Pen will 
heed the call for unity of the RPR-UDF candidate in May 1995. 
There was no foregoing evidence of the magnitude of the slide 
suffered by the Socialists and the Greens in last year's 
parliamentary election. And no evidence of yesterday's 
startling results either. 
  Everything seems to point to a shift away from ideology 
toward the irrational, the emotional, and a kind of tribalism. 
In such a context, what will be the outcome of the battle to be 
fought in May 1995? There is more to this challenge than 
renewed growth or lower unemployment figures. It also refers to 
the growing irrational and emotional charge relayed and 
amplified by the electronic media. This is an issue which RPR 
and UDF presidential candidates cannot ignore.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Joseph Mace-Scaron: "The Left: Homogeneous </F>
or Fragmented?"] 
  [Text] Until now, the Left has managed to resist the sirens 
of division because it included one dominating party, the PS 
[Socialist Party], which had a presidential candidate. As these 
two pillars have been dealt a serious blow by the results of the 
European election, the system appears today on the verge 
collapse. 
  Paradoxically enough, yesterday the Left could be made to 
look strong still if one referred to its performance in the 
European election of June 1989: 33.7 percent. And yet it never 
appeared more fragile, probably because of its fragmentation. A 
fragmentation that cannot be blamed solely on the presidential 
ambitions of the men leading its various lists -- "European 
Solidarity" [headed by PS Secretary General Michel Rocard], 
"Radical Energy" [Bernard Tapie], and even "Alternative Policy" 
[Jean-Pierre Chevenement]... -- but on significant differences 
in methods, rhetoric, and even platforms, to such an extent that 
one comes to wonder whether the Left remains a single entity or 
it has truly lost its cohesion. 
<H5>  New Strategy </H5>
  Can this situation pave the way for [European Commission 
President] Jacques Delors' return, so often announced and 
postponed just as often? By claiming throughout the campaign 
that he would run for president "no matter the results on the 
evening of 12 June," Michel Rocard had finally impressed his 
determination on those who make up the very fabric of a 
Socialist Party that increasingly resembles the 
Radical-Socialist party of the early 1900's: the mayors. 
  However, those Socialist leaders who were invited to attend 
a 
joint meeting with Michel Rocard and Jacques Delors at the 
Lutetia Hotel last Friday came out of it with the disquieting 
feeling that Michel Rocard had paled into a meek novice when 
faced with Jacques Delors' supreme determination and confidence. 
  Worse for the former advocate of the "second Left": by 
proposing a "new alliance" as the campaign was nearing its end, 
he jeopardized the only structure he managed to build: the 
"Conference for Social Change." Bernard Tapie and Jean-Pierre 
Chevenement's negative answers were hardly a surprise for 
Socialist policy makers. 
  However, the biting reply of Communist Party [PCF] Leader 
Robert Hue, who still has not been granted a meeting with Michel 
Rocard, does not bode well for the would-be alliance. 
  And it is no secret that most Socialist and Communist 
leaders 
and elected officials have focusing on the May 1995 presidential 
election, and also (above all?) on the municipal election 
scheduled to take place shortly thereafter. What the mayors 
need is not so much a leader as a new strategy. 
  The results of 12 June clearly showed that the Left cannot 
continue along the same road as the one followed by Michel 
Rocard, a leader discredited after the parliamentary election of 
March 1993. It is now too late to provoke a "big bang." Indeed, 
if there was one, it took place in the ballot box. Left-wing 
parties must now come up with something new. Who is to be their 
leader this time? 
  Will it be with or without the party apparatus? Or with or 
without Bernard Tapie? The field is wide open for those who 
often chose to bet on imagination, but never has time been in 
such a short supply for them.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "DOXA: 66 Percent of Italians Trust </F>
the Head of Government"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Sixty-six percent of the Italians trust 
Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister, according to a poll taken 
by DOXA prior to the European elections and published only 
yesterday. Those interviewed said that they had "a lot" (27 
percent) or "sufficient" (39 percent) trust in the present head 
of the government, who in this way achieved an approval rating 
of 66 percent. Eleven percent of those interviewed had no trust 
in him and 18 percent "little," a dissapproval rating of 29 
percent. This makes Berlusconi the prime minister who, since 
1992, has inspired most trust in Italians. Previously Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi achieved a 60 percent approval rating in May 
1993, which fell however to 51 percent in September and 49 
percent in January of this year.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F>
Paolo Biondi; place and date not given: "Fini: No Disagreement 
Among Us; We All Support the Government" -- first paragraph is 
L'INFORMAZIONE introduction] 
  [Text] He won 100,000 more votes than Berlusconi in the 
South. That was enough to make AN [National Alliance leader] 
Fini the Knight [Berlusconi's nickname] of the South. And in 
order to show that he too has now become a knight, with his own 
sword, he immediately issued messages of war to those within his 
party (sorry, movement) who want to wage war on him: "Let there 
by all means be a policy debate, but once a decision has been 
made.... It must be remembered that we are now a government 
force and every vote must be used for the policy deliberately 
adopted by us all." 
  [Biondi] Pino Rauti has reaffirmed the need to differentiate 
the National Alliance from the Italian Social Movement [MSI]. 
Do you agree? 
  [Fini] The AN is a confederation of elements including the 
MSI, which is not the only one. I see no need for major 
differences, partly because hitherto the AN line has been backed 
by 99 percent of the movement and 90 percent of the MSI. 
  [Biondi] What are the prospects for the 10 percent that 
disagrees? 
  [Fini] It will try to make its arguments prevail. I see no 
problems of any kind. 
  [Biondi] Is there room for a right-wing opposition within 
the 
AN? 
  [Fini] I hope that within our movement there is no room for 
a 
government and an opposition. In a movement it is policy that 
counts, and once that has been adopted, it must be the same for 
everyone. 
  [Biondi] But since there is no longer a right-wing 
opposition 
in Italy, will anyone be able to occupy that space? 
  [Fini] I see no such danger. People engage in opposition in 
order to defend rights that are being trampled, not as a 
preconceived stance. If, as I hope, the AN succeeds in having 
the government implement the policies that we advocated when we 
were in opposition, there will be no reason to occupy the 
"space" you mention. 
  [Biondi] [Interior Minister] Maroni has talked about the 
possibility of coordination between the government forces. Do 
you consider it possible? 
  [Fini] I found that statement by Maroni interesting, but I 
did not fully understand it. Local cooperation is certainly 
possible when you vote for a mayor backed by a coalition of 
forces. If there is an electoral reform in the direction of a 
first-past-the-post system featuring a single round, then 
obviously cooperation will be facilitated. But that does not 
mean unification. 
  [Biondi] [Prime Minister] Berlusconi said that there could 
be 
an election in the fall. What do you think? 
  [Fini] I do not think there will be an election. I neither 
hope for nor fear an election. Having said that, I see no 
chance of one, unless the opposition forces in the Senate 
continue their stubborn attitude and prevent the government from 
governing, against the will again expressed by the voters. It 
all depends on what the Popular Party does in the Senate, but I 
think that it is not in their interest to continue stubbornly 
opposing the government. 
  [Biondi] What stance will you adopt in Europe? 
  [Fini] I have already initiated contacts with other European 
politicians. I would rather not discuss them at present. 
Certainly, we will not be either with the European left-wing 
forces or with the European right-wing forces of the outgoing 
European Parliament, so we will not be with [French National 
Front leader] Le Pen, for instance. 
  [Biondi] At public rallies importance has been attached to 
ideological issues... 
  [Fini] I have no intention of returning to the past and to 
old polemics. In any case, the Italian people have shown that 
they are not interested in this nonsense but in specifics. 
Berlusconi's great result is reflected in his occupying the 
prime ministership and by his promise to resolve the economic 
crisis. All the rest is nonsense.

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League leader Umberto Bossi by </F>
Guido Passalacqua; place and date not given: "Bossi Submits: 
We Will Be Loyal" -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Milan -- He spent the whole night in his office 
talking with Milan's Mayor Formentini and with his ministers -- 
Pagliarini, Gnutti, and Speroni. At 1800 hours he gave a press 
conference to reply to Berlusconi and to present the League with 
a line to follow after its election defeat. It can all be 
summed up in one word, the one that Berlusconi has been using 
for some time -- "loyalty," which he repeated six times to 
journalists. Loyalty to the government, albeit together with a 
promise that there will always be "a trial of strength" on 
"matters of principle" -- legislation on television and 
monopolies. This came together with an announcement that the 
establishment of a separatist League faction will be made 
official [at a League rally] in Pontida. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Is this a return to your origins? 
  [Bossi] The League was born separatist, but we did not want 
to split the country. Over half the party is federalist, and 
this position is a strategic one within the government. 
However, there is a need for a separatist faction, and the time 
has come to establish a differentiation. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] This decision could lead to a loss of 
support 
from the more moderate voters. 
  [Bossi] I have no idea how strong the separatist faction 
could be, but the path to be pursued is not dissimilar to that 
formerly traveled by the PCI [Italian Communist Party] in order 
to attract moderates and Communist Renewal, the angry votes. 
The League must follow this path: There is a moderate vote and 
a separatist vote; and we must work along separate channels. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] How do you judge the election result? 
  [Bossi] It reflects the country's internal situation. There 
is a difficulty in terms of governability, and the vote went in 
that direction, rewarding Forza Italia. We opted to stand alone 
in order to clarify our position. There are two tendencies 
within the government -- one, neoliberal: the League; the 
other, die-hard capitalist: Forza Italia and the AN [National 
Alliance]. These two forces cannot be superimposed. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] You wanted a clarification but you lost. 
  [Bossi] We chose the European elections, which have less 
impact than the general elections, to make it clear that we are 
not subordinate, but also to indicate to the country that it 
must not regard as fights what are in fact discussions between 
conservative forces and a force that one could define as 
neoliberal, namely, the League. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Your allies accuse you of disloyalty. 
  [Bossi] I am loyal to the government. There could be no 
other government. 
  [LAS REPUBBLICA] For the first time in its history, the 
League has suffered a heavy defeat. 
  [Bossi] The loss was expected. Of course, some percentages 
were not forecast. But this was the price that we had to pay 
after the establishment of the Freedom Alliance. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] A price? 
  [Bossi] People saw Berlusconi as the cat and us as the 
mouse. 
If we had not made ourselves visible, this game would have 
caused the League to merge inevitably with Forza Italia. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But you have waged guerrilla warfare within 
the government. 
  [Bossi] I repeat: We have the utmost loyalty to this 
government. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Why did Berlusconi win? 
  [Bossi] It is no coincidence that someone who is involved 
with supermarkets won support. Berlusconi won because he was 
best at selling fantasies and hopes. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] He won, you lost. What do you have to say to 
him now? 
  [Bossi] Good luck. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] You have 180 members of parliament, but only 
a little more than 6 percent -- an inconsistency which some 
people would like to reduce. 
  [Bossi] What counts is the 180 members of parliament, not 
idle talk. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] You talk about loyalty to the government, 
but 
also about trials of strength. What if, let us imagine, the 
trial of strength over antitrust legislation were to result in a 
rupture? 
  [Bossi] Perfect: Then the country will know who is to blame; 
it will know that Berlusconi, with all his television channels, 
does not want to change anything. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] You talk about loyalty to the government, 
but 
you seem to be looking to the Left too. 
  [Bossi] We are advocates of economic liberalism; the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] leaders could be so too, but the 
grassroots are marxists. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you think there could be early elections? 
  [Bossi] The country should fear them, because of the chaos 
they would cause. But the League is not afraid of them: When 
they come, we will be there. But I do not think that Berlusconi 
wants them. His strength lies in guaranteeing governability. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] There are signs of dissent within the 
League. 
[Interior Minister] Maroni is proposing an organizational union 
with Forza Italia and the AN. [Milan Mayor] Formentini says 
that there must be an end to the attacks on the government. 
What is going on? 
  [Bossi] I fear that an organizational union would be 
inconsistent with the League's values: It would be a mess. 
Organizational integration would inevitably also entail 
political integration. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] [PDS Secretary] Occhetto has resigned after 
the defeat. Have you considered doing so? 
  [Bossi] No, what happened was forecast.

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F>
Roberto Gervaso; place and date not given: "Silvio Has the 
Television Channels, I Have the Streets" -- first four 
paragraphs are L'INDIPENDENTE introduction] 
  [Text] Milan -- He feels more of a leader than ever, and if 
anyone questions his charisma, he adopts a crusading attitude. 
A Godfrey of Bouillon, as well as an Albert of Guissano 
[medieval crusaders], to whom God has entrusted the mission of 
destroying Fortress Italia and of subjugating the Saladin 
Berlusconi without placing him in chains. 
  The two allies spy on one another, neither trusting the 
other 
sufficiently. The two allies are strong as long as they remain 
united (between themselves and with [National Alliance leader] 
Fini), but are less united than they should be and than the 
voters would like. 
  If Berlusconi goads him, [League Secretary] Bossi replies by 
calling him the "Kaiser," the "Fuehrer," the would-be tyrant, 
the cynical "foundry boss": It is a difficult marriage but one 
that is destined to last. Otherwise, it means an early election 
and political upheavals, with imponderable consequences or, 
worse, a swing toward authoritarianism. 
  May God help us. And may God help Umberto [Bossi] and Silvio 
[Berlusconi], the founder of the League and of Forza Italia 
respectively. 
  [Gervaso] What will happen to the League in the European 
elections? 
  [Bossi] It will hold its ground. In fact, it will gain a few 
points. 
  [Gervaso] And what will happen to the government, after 
that? 
  [Bossi] Nothing. 
  [Gervaso] What do you mean, nothing? 
  [Bossi] The European elections have nothing to do with the 
Italian Government or with Italian domestic politics. 
  [Gervaso] Do you mean that there are no strong feelings 
about 
the elections? 
  [Bossi] Certainly not on the part of the nationalist and 
leftist parties. 
  [Gervaso] Does Berlusconi not feel strongly about them 
either? 
  [Bossi] As far as Berlusconi is concerned, Europe is a huge 
market with no regulations and with no legislative parliament. 
All that concerns him is financial strength. 
  [Gervaso] Why do you take issue so strongly with the prime 
minister? 
  [Bossi] Who said I do? 
  [Gervaso] You mean you do not know? 
  [Bossi] I am simply asserting my identity and that of the 
League within the Freedom Alliance, which, as you know, was 
launched by my movement. 
  [Gervaso] Why do you say that Berlusconi represents "the 
old, 
the oldest of the old"? 
  [Bossi] That is not exactly what I am saying. I am saying 
that Berlusconi is the last link in a transformation which was 
set in motion when we, we of the League, prevented the election 
of members of the CAF [Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani] group to the 
presidency. 
  [Gervaso] Which members? 
  [Bossi] Forlani and Andreotti. Their fall marked the fall of 
Craxi as well. 
  [Gervaso] What do you envy about the prime minister? 
  [Bossi] Nothing. I know no envy, just as I know no rancor or 
hatred. Berlusconi is certainly a man of great tactical skills. 
  [Gervaso] But does he know anything about politics? 
  [Bossi] Enough. He is not unprepared. 
  [Gervaso] What about him do you not envy? 
  [Bossi] His desire to be first. 
  [Gervaso] Why: Do you not have that desire? 
  [Bossi] It is not so important. You see, there are moments 
in history when destiny, through its often inscrutable designs, 
places you at the center of historic changes. 
  [Gervaso] That is determinism. 
  [Bossi] Not necessarily. I wanted to be a doctor, and 
instead, here I am, leading the League. 
  [Gervaso] Are you more afraid of Berlusconi or is Berlusconi 
more afraid of you? 
  [Bossi] I am not afraid of Berlusconi or of anyone else. I 
merely note that he has so many television channels and so many 
newspapers with which he attacks me and deals me devastating 
blows. 
  [Gervaso] I would not say so. 
  [Bossi] He does, he does. With a great deal of skill. 
  [Gervaso] In that case you should be afraid of Berlusconi. 
  [Bossi] I have the League and its formidable organization: 
They are enough for me. He has the television channels; I have 
the streets. 
  [Gervaso] Are you happier to shake hands with Berlusconi or 
with Fini? 
  [Bossi] I do shake hands with Fini. 
  [Gervaso] And what about Berlusconi? 
  [Bossi] He prefers to embrace you. 
  [Gervaso] What kind of an embrace? A deadly one? 
  [Bossi] I am a prey with talons, that will not allow 
himself to be torn apart. 
  [Gervaso] If Berlusconi is a Kaiser, what is Fini? 
  [Bossi] I do not know what he is. What I do know is that at 
the moment he is ambiguous. 
  [Gervaso] Why, ambiguous? 
  [Bossi] Because he needs to be legitimized by Berlusconi. 
  [Gervaso] Does that need influence him? 
  [Bossi] Yes, but I do not know how much. 
  [Gervaso] Do you get along better with Forza Italia's leader 
or with Fini? 
  [Bossi] Better with Fini. Perhaps because he knows that 
sooner or later he will merge with Berlusconi. 
  [Gervaso] What is the best thing about Forza Italia? 
  [Bossi] There was a vacuum in politics, and Berlusconi 
filled 
it. It is thanks to him that we joined the government. 
  [Gervaso] The worst thing? 
  [Bossi] His materialism. I repeat: He is the last link in a 
chain of transformation which is functioning as an inhibitor. 
  [Gervaso] Why? 
  [Bossi] Because there is no politics without ideals. 
  [Gervaso] How can you forget that Berlusconi prevented a 
victory by the Left by entering the arena? 
  [Bossi] But he also tried to recycle the DC [Christian 
Democratic Party] and the Socialists. 
  [Gervaso] What is the best aspect of the National Alliance? 
  [Bossi] Its rational tendency, which coincides more or less 
with Fini, who nevertheless has to be legitimized by Berlusconi 
and who thus risks becoming ensnared. 
  [Gervaso] What is the worst thing about the National 
Alliance? 
  [Bossi] Its banners, its backward-looking tendencies, and 
its 
past, which oblige Fini to make certain concessions and to grant 
some institutional influence to the old and hard-line wing of 
the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. 
  [Gervaso] In which party are there the most dilettantes? 
  [Bossi] Definitely in Forza Italia -- the party of the 
toupees and the great vested interests, which has opted for the 
politics of so-called ordinary society: a disguise for a 
philosophical plan of transformation. Do you know what the 
trouble is? 
  [Gervaso] What is it? 
  [Bossi] That those who vote for Berlusconi do not realize 
it. 
  [Gervaso] I do not understand. 
  [Bossi] The idea of a chaste and pure society set against 
always corrupt politics is a false one. 
  [Gervaso] Which party has the most professionals? 
  [Bossi] The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], because it 
is 
an old party with an apparatus, a bureaucracy, a school, and 
internal homogeneity. The opposite of Forza Italia -- a very 
flexible movement, a factory-party which raises the issue of 
democracy. 
  [Gervaso] Why? 
  [Bossi] Because it is an autocratic movement in which there 
are no elections, but appointments -- from the top. 
  [Gervaso] In which party do you have most friends? 
  [Bossi] When I come to think about it, in none. Perhaps 
because the political scene now is in a constant state of 
turmoil and evolution. 
  [Gervaso] And in which party do you have most enemies? 
  [Bossi] At the personal level, in Forza Italia. 
  [Gervaso] And at the political level? 
  [Bossi] In none, because everyone acknowledges that the 
League caused the walls and roofs of the old edifice of power to 
totter and fall. 
  [Gervaso] In which party do you have most accomplices, most 
Trojan horses? 
  [Bossi] In Forza Italia, I think. Let us hope that the 
opposite is not true. 
  [Gervaso] Is there fascism only on the Right? 
  [Bossi] Fascism in what sense? 
  [Gervaso] In terms of intolerance. 
  [Bossi] It exists on the far Right and it exists on the far 
Left. The fascists and Communist Renewal are angry people, 
active only in word, but subordinate in deed. The former to the 
National Alliance, and the latter to the PDS. 
  [Gervaso] Is there antifascism only on the Left? 
  [Bossi] No. Look at the League: It is the most antifascist 
party. It is no coincidence that both right-wing and the 
left-wing extremists take issue with us. If I appear in public 
they both give me the bird. 
  [Gervaso] What if Berlusconi appears in public? 
  [Bossi] Only the die-hard communists give him the bird. 
  [Gervaso] Who are the League's supporters? 
  [Bossi] Those who believe that through active commitment it 
is possible to change Italy; to resolve its political, economic, 
and social problems; and to impart a new boost to its great 
social and individual principles. 
  [Gervaso] How many tendencies are there within the League 
now? 
  [Bossi] Two. The tendency of those who want change, the 
regeneration of the state; and the tendency of those who want to 
bring it down or replace it. But the latter are in a minority. 
  [Gervaso] Who is more loyal to the League: You or [former 
League ideologue] Miglio? 
  [Bossi] Miglio, the advocate of a strong and presidentialist 
state, has no background as a federalist. 
  [Gervaso] Is the League's former ideologue a separatist, a 
traitor, or a suicidal? 
  [Bossi] Those words are too strong. In 1992 I included him 
on our lists to attract the moderate voters, who could thus vote 
for a university teacher. 
  [Gervaso] But is he or is he not a politician? 
  [Bossi] He is a political scientist, that is, someone who 
interprets politics after the event. If you give him the 
steering wheel he will skid at the first bend and go off the 
road. 
  [Gervaso] But you could have granted him a ministry. 
  [Bossi] Neither Berlusconi nor Fini would do so. 
  [Gervaso] How did he react? 
  [Bossi] He blamed me. He insulted me over the telephone -- 
this very telephone -- for a quarter of an hour. 
  [Gervaso] What did you do? 
  [Bossi] I let him speak, then eventually I blurted out: "I'm 
sorry that at the age of 80 you need a ministry in order to 
prove yourself." 
  [Gervaso] Who within the League would like to stab you in 
the 
back? 
  [Bossi] Let us hope that it happens soon so that I can 
occupy 
myself with the things I would like. 
  [Gervaso] What, for instance? 
  [Bossi] To preside over the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  [Gervaso] Who are the complainers within the League? 
  [Bossi] Some people complain about the various regional 
secretaries. The League's two tendencies -- federalist and 
separatist -- can also give rise to ill feelings and polemics. 
But all this does not affect our essential compactness. 
  [Gervaso] Is it easier for an elephant's trunk to pass 
through the eye of a needle or for a southerner to become a 
League supporter? 
  [Bossi] Look, a large number of southerners have joined the 
League. The federalist wing has made a breakthrough everywhere 
-- from Lambrate to Capo Passero. 
  [Gervaso] Does federalism remain your obsession? 
  [Bossi] It is the cornerstone of the League, the single 
target, on which the great change depends. 
  [Gervaso] Is the League now more of a bulldozer or a cement 
mixer? 
  [Bossi] A cement mixer, but if necessary, a bulldozer too. 
  [Gervaso] Could the League ever do without you? 
  [Bossi] The League has battled, is still battling, and will 
continue to battle. I am a fighter, capable of shooting in all 
directions. 
  [Gervaso] Could you ever do without the League? 
  [Bossi] I could. At congresses I do not concern myself with 
factions, large or small. I will continue along the path I have 
chosen, always prepared to relinquish my post and always willing 
to continue. 
  [Gervaso] In what circumstances would you leave the League? 
  [Bossi] You cannot join or leave the League just as you 
please. You join because other people want you there, and you 
leave for the same reason. I am the instrument of the cause to 
restore constitutional state. 
  [Gervaso] On the subject of comings and goings, will 
Scalfaro 
leave the presidency? 
  [Bossi] Definitely. 
  [Gervaso] When? 
  [Bossi] Berlusconi would say, "Once the new Constitution has 
been drawn up and once presidentialism has been introduced." 
  [Gervaso] When will that be? 
  [Bossi] Let us say, in a couple of years' time. 
  [Gervaso] How can [former Senate Speaker] Spadolini be 
compensated? 
  [Bossi] Time moves on, and he has had his time. I realize 
that the state and the Republic were his life, his family, but 
now he must understand. Politics is merciless to everyone. 
  [Gervaso] Is [Senate speaker] Scognamiglio a good choice, or 
would Speroni have been better? 
  [Bossi] Speroni is a formula one racer; Scognamiglio is a 
luxury car. 
  [Gervaso] Is [Chamber of Deputies speaker] Irene Pivetti the 
guardian of the institutions or guardian of the Church? 
  [Bossi] She considers herself to be invested of an authority 
that comes directly from God, to whom she has devoted her term 
of office. 
  [Gervaso] Do you have any advice to give to [Pact for Italy 
leader] Segni? 
  [Bossi] If he opts for values, let him approach the League. 
If he prefers conservation, then let him approach Forza Italia. 
  [Gervaso] Any advice for Formigoni [Italian Popular Party, 
PPI]? 
  [Bossi] He has already taken advice from Berlusconi, and he 
has become his fifth column. 
  [Gervaso] Any for Buttiglione [PPI]? 
  [Bossi] To develop some autonomy. 
  [Gervaso] Are you disturbed more by Rosa Russo Jervolino or 
by Rosy Bindi [PPI]? 
  [Bossi] I am not disturbed; they may be disturbing. 
  [Gervaso] What if you had to choose? 
  [Bossi] I would not choose. I can only say that Rosa is a 
well-rounded and fulfilled lady; Rosy is more combative and 
therefore politically more interesting. 
  [Gervaso] Do you trust Occhetto or D'Alema [PDS] more? 
  [Bossi] Occhetto. He is better balanced, more intelligent 
and human. D'Alema is a rather serrated knife edge. He is 
sharper than Occhetto, and the voters and grassroots would be 
unlikely to forgive him any mistakes. 
  [Gervaso] Are you not flirting rather too much with the PDS? 
  [Bossi] I never flirt with the PDS, which wants a League, 
within the Freedom Alliance, subordinate to Berlusconism, which 
has nothing to say to us and nothing to give us. 
  [Gervaso] But as you yourself have said, you would not have 
joined the government without Berlusconi. 
  [Bossi] But we would have had the same number of 
parliamentarians elected. 
  [Gervaso] Why have the chairmanships of so many Senate 
committees been granted to members of the progressive forces? 
  [Bossi] Because of lack of expertise, or perhaps because of 
the excessive power of the Forza Italia and National Alliance 
leadership group. Those two parties' conservatives have failed 
to realize that permanent committees are needed in order to 
govern. 
  [Gervaso] What about the watchdog committees? 
  [Bossi] In a democracy they belong to the opposition. In 
other words, there should have been negotiations. 
  [Bossi] Is there any ministry that you would have liked but 
did not secure? 
  [Bossi] Perhaps the Education Ministry. Be that as it may, 
we wanted ministries in order to plan the country's future, and 
we got them. 
  [Gervaso] Are you hungry for the prime ministership? 
  [Bossi] Berlusconi is fine, for the present. 
  [Gervaso] Will this government live long? 
  [Bossi] Probably. 
  [Gervaso] Months or years? 
  [Bossi] Years. 
  [Gervaso] Who could shorten its life? 
  [Bossi] Any ally that considered that the time had come for 
a 
show of strength and another election. 
  [Gervaso] Which grouping would gain most votes from another 
election? 
  [Bossi] None. It would be chaos. 
  [Gervaso] Are you sure that the corruption investigations 
were a sham? 
  [Bossi] Not merely a sham. At the beginning they were a 
mechanism of restoration. After the League brought down the old 
regime, the judiciary attacked their former "masters," by then 
reduced to zombies. 
  [Gervaso] Why do you insinuate that [Judge] Di Pietro 
conducted a political trial of the League? 
  [Bossi] Because he did so. When he questioned me he asked me 
if we wanted to split the country. In any case, what does the 
League have to do with Bribe City? 
  [Gervaso] Does the RAI [Italian Public Broadcasting 
Corporation] need to be cleansed or purged? 
  [Bossi] I was the first, a year ago, to talk about purges, 
albeit in a provocative manner. The fact is that there must be 
a review of the entire radio and television system, both public 
and private. Both the RAI and Fininvest must be deprived of 
some channels. 
  [Gervaso] Which is your dominant trait -- the eye of a hawk, 
the dogged determination of a bulldog, or the cunning of a fox? 
  [Bossi] I am a hawk who keeps his aggression under control. 
  [Gervaso] Do you feel more like a native of Brianza or a 
providential leader? 
  [Bossi] I would never have aspired to become leader of the 
League. It was events that obliged me to do it. 
  [Gervaso] Is yours still hard? 
  [Bossi] Tougher than ever. But my inner core is still 
intact. 
  [Gervaso] What does your core have to do with it? 
  [Bossi] I do not suffer from priapism. 
  [Gervaso] Whose is hardest: yours, Berlusconi's, or Fini's? 
  [Bossi] Are you kidding? Mine is by far the hardest.

<F P=106> [Report by Concita De Gregorio: "Democratic Party of the </F>
Left Divided Between D'Alema and Veltroni"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- The duelists, i.e., the main characters 
on the scene: [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Deputy 
Secretary] Massimo D'Alema and [L'UNITA editor] Walter Veltroni. 
The "great old men," the forefathers capable of spreading a 
safety net under the free-falling party: [former Chamber of 
Deputies speaker] Giorgio Napolitano and [outgoing Italian 
General Confederation of Labor Secretary General] Bruno Trentin. 
The young mayors, ready to stand in for any of the main actors 
who may suffer an accident: Antonio Bassolino (Naples), and 
Walter Vitali (Bologna). The competent and telegenic 
"outsiders" who are natural candidates for the anti-Berlusconi 
hero's role: [Venice Mayor] Massimo Cacciari and [Rome Mayor] 
Francesco Rutelli, neither of whom is a PDS member but who, as 
it is commonly said, belong to the "same area." They are all 
under 50, apart from the sages who are about 70. In many cases, 
their relations are difficult, except for the "old men," who 
keep quiet. One of these men will be the PDS's next secretary. 
The selection process had been going on for some time now, but, 
officially, the campaigning starts today. 
  For a single (and, moreover, uncomfortable) post, this may 
seem a long list, but after all, there are only six candidates 
plus two alternates, and the real match is only between two of 
them. Indeed, Botteghe Oscure's [PDS headquarters] spin doctors 
are saying: "There is no confrontation, there will be no 
confrontation." The PDS has never witnessed an open tug of war 
between two candidates, the party follows a "tradition" of full 
consensus, of unanimous agreement on a single name. If there is 
a struggle, it takes place before, behind the scenes. 
Officially, there will be no war: Everybody will want D'Alema 
or everybody will want Veltroni. However, since 39-year old 
Walter Veltroni, L'UNITA's chief editor, is telling anyone who 
wants to listen that he is happy with his paper, which is so 
successful, that he has no wish to become PDS secretary, and 
that, in any case, he is not prepared to run as a candidate for 
one side (in this case, Occhetto's side), it is difficult to see 
where the problem or the uncertainty really lie. It would seem 
that only Alema, 45, is actually in the contest. D'Alema has a 
majority in the party and among the regional secretaries. If a 
ballot were held now -- they assured us at Botteghe Oscure's 
press office -- he would most certainly become the PDS's next 
leader. 
<H5>  Cacciari Is Not a Member </H5>
  Where, then, does the problem lie? In the fact that Occhetto 
did not leave peacefully and resignedly on the eve of the 
congress, handing over power to his official successor, as 
D'Alema -- on the evening of the European elections -- had 
suggested he should do. Occhetto left in a huff and at once, 
cursing his enemies, first and foremost his internal enemies, 
particularly Cacciari and D'Alema. "`I am leaving, but you 
will also have to leave,' is written in that letter," said one 
of Occhetto's "colonels" who was among the first to leave 
Botteghe Oscure yesterday afternoon. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  An Invention by the Papers </H5>
  What if Cacciari were indeed the name that the PDS is 
looking 
for? "Look, Cacciari is an invention by the papers, he is 
completely extraneous to the party, and is altogether unpopular. 
He is not even a member, he has no chance at all," one of the 
leaders closest to Occhetto says sharply. Achille [Occhetto] 
hates him, since he was the man who first posed the problem of 
succession. However, whether Occhetto likes it or not, Cacciari 
has all the requisites which by now the PDS acknowledges in a 
potential anti-Berlusconi leader: He is telegenic and cultured, 
he is fascinating, witty, fairly young, and women like him. In 
addition, he is a philosopher, not just some sort of bureaucrat. 
"Let us keep things separate. One thing is the leader of the 
progressives, and another the PDS' secretary," Umberto Ranieri 
suggests. Two different things: a secretary, who must be found 
immediately, and a leader for the coalition, who can wait until 
later. Given the abovementioned requisites, apart from Cacciari 
himself, Francesco Rutelli would also make a good progressive 
leader. The same applies to Veltroni, assuming that an 
agreement is reached along the lines suggested by some: D'Alema 
would immediately become the secretary, whereas Veltroni -- who 
is Kennedyesque, charismatic, and appeals to young people -- 
would become the Left's leader shortly afterwards. Late in the 
day, the corridors were buzzing with this question: If the Left 
and the PDS choose the same man, who will have the courage to 
tell Veltroni?

<F P=106> [Report by M. Abizanda: "Reform of Army of Year 2000 in Its </F>
Final Stage"] 
  [Text] The Army General Staff is putting the finishing 
touches to what will be its organization at the beginning of the 
year 2000, which will entail a considerable reduction of 
personnel, prompted by the Personnel Law, and of units, because 
of the current shortages of personnel and funds. The main 
discussions right now center on the final makeup of the Rapid 
Action Force (FAR), with the uncertainty about whether or not it 
will have armored cavalry vehicles assigned to it and about the 
Airborne Brigade. The final drafting of the "Master Plan" 
["Plan Norte"] will be completed over the next few weeks for 
inclusion in the new Joint Strategic Plan. 
  The idea of reducing the number of Army units came from the 
General Staff itself during Lieutenant General Ramon Porgueres 
Hernandez' time as chief of staff. The Army itself realized 
that with the number of brigades that it has right now -- 15 -- 
it could not have them all at full strength in personnel and 
equipment, and so it was decided to reduce them with the aim of 
rationalizing human and material resources. For this reason, 
the units' structure is divided into three levels of force -- 
Rapid Action, Reaction, and Territorial Defense -- reducing the 
number of brigades to a maximum of 15, although these would 
include the extrapeninsular units, with some of them at 30 
percent of full strength. 
  Sources consulted by this newspaper stated that one of the 
liveliest debates right now concerns the FAR's final makeup. It 
is clear that both the Paratroop Brigade and the future 
Legionnaire Brigade -- the Legion Command's replacement -- 
already form part of that new Army unit. However, the debate 
centers right now on who will accompany the paratroops and 
legionnaires. 
<H5>  Two Ideas </H5>
  Right now, there are two views of the FAR: the Army's more 
traditional view and that of the Defense Ministry and Defense 
Headquarters [EMAD], which seem to be in favor of including 
armored cavalry vehicles. The Airborne Brigade's future also 
depends on the outcome of this debate. 
  The Army holds a traditional view of the FAR, and so it 
believes that the third unit assigned should be the 
aforementioned Airborne Brigade. According to this view, a 
deployment of this kind must not be delayed by the movement of 
armored vehicles. Hence, the light infantry should be the first 
stage of that deployment, establishing and holding positions 
until the later reinforcements belonging to the Reaction Force 
arrive. 
  However, the Defense Ministry and EMAD believe that, on the 
contrary, an FAR should have the support of armored vehicles 
belonging to cavalry -- "one of the lessons of the involvement 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina," according to military sources. The 
reason for this stance is that the infantry units should have 
the support of armored vehicles, which provide greater 
firepower, until the reaction units arrive. "Moreover," they 
state, "as soon as the units that have been deployed need to 
carry out reconnaissance, they should have cavalry forces." 
  For this reason, the Defense Ministry and EMAD maintain that 
the FAR should have armored vehicles, although they point out 
that they would never make up a regimental unit, but rather, a 
maximum of two groups (battalions). 
  The presence of cavalry forces could cause the Airborne 
Brigade's exclusion from the FAR. This unit, with its 
headquarters in Pontevedra and with two regiments -- the Isabel 
la Catolica in that city and the Principe in Asturias -- have 
the handicap of not having airports sufficiently close, and 
those that do exist are not well suited to military use, 
according to the aforementioned sources. 
  Nor have the doubts been dispelled about the makeup of the 
Reaction Force, comprising the only division that will be left 
in the Army -- the First Mechanized Division. Although no 
decision has been taken as yet, this division would comprise the 
current 12th Brigade, the 21st Mechanized Brigade of Cerro 
Muriano, and the Castillejos 2 Cavalry Brigade. This division 
would also include the 42d Mountain Light Infantry Brigade, and 
the uncertainties center on the makeup of the other mechanized 
brigade that this division would have, which could be the 11th 
brigade of Botoa, Badajoz, or 31st brigade, of Betera 
(Valencia). This division will be assigned to take part in NATO 
missions, and one of its future brigades -- that of Cerro 
Muriano -- to the European Army Corps. 
  The Reaction Force will also include the FAMET (Army 
Airmobile Forces), although they will be at the disposal of the 
FAR's requirements for their deployment. 
  In any event, what does seem clear is that there will be 
substantial differences between the original draft of the 
"Master Plan" and the current one, although the sources 
consulted emphasize that there is nothing finalized as yet, and 
there could still be changes. These could include a change in 
the idea of leaving the existing garrisons in the Basque Country 
and Catalonia at a minimum, with reduced brigades of 1,500 men. 
<H5>  From 180,000 to 115,000 </H5>
  The reduction of human resources -- one of the causes of 
this 
new redeployment -- is prompted by the implementation of the 
Personnel Law, resulting from the approval in parliament of the 
model of the Armed Forces of the year 2000. This decision left 
the total number of Armed Forces personnel at 180,000 men and 
women, including troops, and at least 55 percent 
professionalized. 
  Hence the Army found itself forced to make that reduction 
effort, because the Personnel Law left its personnel at 115,000 
men. Nevertheless, in the event of a crisis or mobilization, 
recourse could be made to 100,000 reservists, who would be 
assigned to the above-mentioned future Territorial Defense 
Force, whose brigades, such as the Jarama Cavalry Brigade or the 
23d Motorized Brigade, will be at 30 percent of full strength in 
peacetime. 
  In any event, right now the Army has the problem of 
professional troops. Although the Defense Ministry has been 
making an effort since a couple of years ago to succeed in 
increasing the number of professional servicemen, the fact is 
that the shortcomings in this respect have been made clear in 
operation Alpha Bravo. 
  While the Legion and the Paratrooper Brigade have been able 
to manage with more or less whole units (the Fourth Corps -- 
Malaga Group, Third Corps -- Canary Islands, and the Third 
Company -- Madrid), albeit reinforced with members of other 
units, in the case of the Cordoba Group recourse has had to be 
had to a variety of units. Thus, in order to make up this unit, 
the southern operational command has had to have recourse to 
forces from the 21st Brigade and the 11th Brigade, assigned to 
the Brunete Armored Division and to the Third Special Operations 
Group of Rabasa, Alicante. 
<H5>  Level of Training </H5>
  A difference is also developing in the units' level of 
training, acknowledged by Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas 
himself. In this connection, the brigades that will be 
strengthened by the new "Master Plan" have an acceptable level 
of training and effectiveness, owing to the maneuvers that they 
conduct, although these have also been cut down over the past 
few months as a result of the fuel problems stemming from the 
budget cuts. 
  However, in the units whose future does not seem so clear 
and 
that will disappear or be left at 30 percent of full strength, 
the level of training is considerably lower, and in some of them 
servicemen are being discharged having fired no more than 20 
bullets during military service. While the main units have fuel 
problems, these units conduct virtually no field exercises in 
which vehicles have to be moved, exercises being confined to the 
level of company (alpha) or, at most, battalion or group (beta). 
<H5>  From Trucks to Missiles </H5>
  The Army is undoubtedly the service that has suffered most 
in terms of equipment over the past few years. Thus, while the 
Navy saw its request for an air-sea group met, or the Air Force 
was commissioning the F-18's, there was no project or program of 
that scale in the Army during the eighties. 
  Only one of the requests made most often by Army personnel 
has been partly met -- the renewal of the tank force. Partly, 
because the chosen solution was to commission M60 tanks that the 
U.S. Army decommissioned as a result of the treaty on the 
reduction of conventional weapons in Europe, and that they were 
giving free of charge. And even so reductions came, since the 
520 tanks initially envisaged have been cut to just 310, most of 
them being the A3 model -- the most modern, albeit outclassed by 
vehicles such as the Abrams M1A1, the British Challenger, or the 
German Leopard. 
  Thus the Army's tank force will be left with the 310 M60's, 
the 164 M48A5's (with the same engine and firing system as the 
foregoing), and 210 AMX-30's, allocated mainly to cavalry units. 
  The Army's main shortages right now lie in transport 
vehicles 
(both trucks and cross-country vehicles), artillery, a new 
armored vehicle, and attack helicopters. 
  The state of the transport vehicles has been a concern since 
the end of the last decade, since over half the fleet of 
vehicles would not pass the roadworthiness test because of their 
state. Accordingly, the Army is emphasizing the need to renew 
that fleet in order to prevent possible accidents. 
  Another preference is to renew the artillery with 155mm 
guns, 
in a long-standing project that seems never to take shape. 
However, the greatest emphasis is placed on missiles. As this 
newspaper has already reported, the Army wishes to replace its 
coastal batteries with mobile antiship missile systems, which 
would make possible much more effective control of the Strait of 
Gibraltar than the current system. In this connection, missiles 
have the advantage of mobility and the difficulty of detecting 
their firing positions, as well as greater accuracy than the 
coastal batteries. 
  In fact, the coordination agreements signed with NATO to 
establish the form of Spanish military participation in the 
Atlantic alliance give our country the responsibility for 
surveillance of the Strait of Gibraltar. 
  An infantry and combat vehicle to complement the wheeled 
armored vehicles, whose good performance in Bosnia -- especially 
in escorting convoys -- is emphasized, is another preference. 
Santa Barbara is currently developing this new vehicle, 
although, according to forecasts, it will not enter into service 
until the end of this decade. 
  Last, it must be pointed out that the lack of combat 
helicopters is another shortage that, according to the Army, 
should be reconsidered. Right now, these tasks are entrusted to 
the FAMET's BO-105's, although military sources have pointed out 
that this is a helicopter inappropriate for these tasks because 
of its lack of power.

<F P=106> [Report by Mariano Guindal: "Government Says That It Will </F>
Be Possible To Create 1,000 Net Jobs Per Day Over Next Two 
Years"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Minister of the Presidency Alfredo Perez 
Rubalcaba stated following the cabinet meeting yesterday that 
2,000 net jobs per day were created in May, according to the 
initial figures supplied by the National Employment Institute 
(INEM). According to him, Social Security has had 105,638 more 
contributors in the first five months of the year than at the 
end of 1993. 
  The government believes that this good performance by the 
labor market will continue in June. This could offset the 
adverse impact on employment that the entry of young people into 
the labor market on completing their education traditionally 
has. Last June, unemployment grew by 35,000, and the estimates 
at the Labor Ministry's disposal forecast that this figure will 
be offset. 
  Rubalcaba stated the the government anticipates that job 
creation will be consolidated as economic growth improves. Over 
the next few weeks, the government will study the new plan for 
convergence with Europe, which forecasts economic growth of 1.3 
percent for 1995 and twice as much for 1996, reaching 3.5 
percent in 1996 [year as published]. 
  This growth of GDP suggests that 1,000 net jobs per day 
could 
be created over the next two years. "That is why this assertion 
by the labor minister is something more than an election 
slogan," Rubalcaba stated. 
  The minister said that the cabinet received with great 
satisfaction the Community's assistance for the development of 
the most backward Spanish regions, totaling 4 trillion pesetas. 
"If the cohesion funds are added to the structural funds, it 
can be said that Spain will receive 6 trillion pesetas from 
Europe between 1994 and 1999." 
  These resources will have a direct impact on job creation, 
"and this has been included in the convergence program, whose 
revision will be presented in Brussels in July." 
  Rubalcaba stated that the structural funds have three aims 
-- 
to improve the production system, train human resources, and 
create water and power infrastructures -- although he said that 
the construction of transport infrastructures, which was the 
previous program's aim, will slacken. Some 77 percent of 
Spanish territory and 66 percent of the population, which falls 
within the so-called first objective, will benefit from this 
assistance. 
  The minister explained that "the aim is to promote public 
investment in the most disadvantaged regions and their gradual 
alignment with the Community average." These investments total 
7.58 trillion pesetas, half of which will be contributed by 
Europe and the remainder by the Spanish Government. 
  Andalusia is the autonomous community that benefits most, 
with 28.8 percent of the funds; Galicia has 13.7 percent; 
Castilla and Leon, 12 percent; Valencia, 11.2 percent; 
Castilla-La Mancha, 8 percent; the Canary Islands, 6.8 percent; 
and the remainder is shared out by Asturias, Cantabria, Murcia, 
and Ceuta and Melilla. 
  Most of these funds -- 34.3 percent -- will be earmarked for 
developing human resources and improving the quality of life 
through vocational training programs and environmental projects. 
Some 33 percent will be earmarked for improving the production 
system, with programs to assist industry, tourism, fisheries, 
and research. Some 24.8 percent will be earmarked for transport 
infrastructures, while 7.9 percent will be invested in water and 
energy. 
  With respect to Seat [automobile enterprise], the minister 
stated that, although this is not scheduled, it is not ruled out 
that Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl will discuss this problem during the summit that they are 
to hold next Monday [6 June]. He emphasized that "Seat is not 
in danger," and stressed that "Volkswagen has never proposed 
winding up the make." He stated that "the Spanish Government 
will help to seek a solution and to save as many jobs as 
possible."

<F P=106> [Article by Carl-Gustav Linden: "Union Researchers Warn of </F>
Long-Term Unemployment"] 
  [Text] Researchers at the Wage Earners Research Institute 
(PT) are concerned over rising long-term unemployment. 
  It is expected that by the end of next year, 190,000 
individuals will have been unemployed for over a year. That is 
40 percent of the jobless total, and according to the PT's 
supervisor, Jukka Pekkarinen, it is a direct result of the 
government's economic and industrial policy. 
  The obligation to place people in jobs, which was deleted 
from the employment laws at the beginning of last year, has led 
to a situation in which more and more long-term unemployed are 
losing all contact with the labor market. Government employment 
measures now cover only one out of every five long-term 
unemployed, compared to one out of every two in 1992 and almost 
70 percent when Finland first entered the recession. 
  Pekkarinen points out that unemployment cannot be markedly 
reduced until the growth rate in production stands at around 5 
percent. We will not reach that point until the end of 1995. The 
researchers therefore feel that in order not to lose one of our 
most important competitive advantages -- a well-trained and 
knowledgeable work force -- Finland must concentrate more 
strongly on an active manpower policy. The institute points out 
that, instead, the funds available to the labor offices are 
being reduced. 
  "When it comes to activity related to labor policy, Finland, 
which used to be at the average level for OECD countries, is now 
falling behind in international comparisons," the PT writes in 
its latest economic forecast for this year and next year. 
<H5>  No Upswing </H5>
  The institute feels that while an economic recovery after 
three years of moving backward can certainly be glimpsed, it is 
still not possible to talk about a real upswing as long as 
private consumption continues to decline. The research team 
feels that the government must relax its extremely tight 
economic policy to some extent, and one of the measures it 
recommends is temporary tax reductions. The value-added tax, 
which will go into effect at the beginning of June, should be 
decreased by 2 percent for one year. 
  The PT is also proposing a program to restore balance in the 
public sector for the purpose of reducing the structural 
deficit, recommending that the partners in the labor market 
commit themselves to low inflation, and proposing that the Bank 
of Finland take an active part in keeping interest rates down. 
  The PT is somewhat more cautious than other research 
institutes. According to its forecast, total production will 
rise by 1 percent this year and 4 percent next year. Exports 
will grow by 20 percent this year and an equal amount next year, 
with their share of total production rising to 40 percent. 
  Exports will be the locomotive of recovery, and the export 
industry's investments will speed up this year and increase by 
15 percent next year, the PT predicts. 
<H5>  Households To Get Less </H5>
  But the purchasing power of households will continue to 
decline. It is predicted that private consumption will decline 
by 2.5 percent this year because households are losing nearly 4 
percent of their purchasing power. Private consumption is 
expected to rise by 3.5 percent next year. 
  Recovery is also foreseen in the unemployment statistics. 
The 
PT is predicting that 430,000 individuals, or 17.5 percent of 
the labor force, will be jobless next year, compared to an 
average of 473,000, or 19 percent, this year. 
  The PT expects weak trends toward rising inflation (1.5 
percent this year), but feels that the threat of inflation is 
not likely to become an urgent problem before the end of this 
decade. 
  The researchers feel that the Bank of Finland could very 
well 
ease up on its monetary policy without endangering its goal of 
keeping inflation at 2 percent or less. 
  Record figures in trade statistics are expected to continue. 
The PT predicts that the surplus in the trade balance will total 
44 billion markkas this year and reach 13 billion markkas in the 
current account balance and then grow to 47 billion markkas and 
20 billion markkas respectively next year.

<F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "The New Poor Ever Increasing"] </F>
  [Text] Up to 200,000 households may at times be thrown into 
the ranks of the new poor, asserts researcher Pentti Ronkko. 
Families in the tens of thousands already have such severe 
economic problems that they are unable to handle the situation. 
The present cost-of-living measures and the official relative 
poverty levels are inadequate when it comes to identifying those 
hit by the new poverty. 
  Ronkko's article on redistribution of incomes is included in 
the book Unfortunate Social Position and Change in the 
Welfare State, which is edited by Professors Mattik 
Heikkila and Kari Vahatalo. The book is part of the Finnish 
Academy's research program on the weaker population groups in 
Finland. 
  Ronkko thinks that the structural defects in the welfare 
state have set up an impoverization process within the middle 
class. The decisionmakers and the state machinery have become 
isolated from daily lives of their fellow citizens. Taxation, 
income transfers, and the associated budget cuts have not been 
targeted adequately, he states. 
  Ronkko writes that the welfare state's safety net is still 
operating relatively well regarding the traditional low-income 
groups and other vulnerable elements, even though several budget 
cut decisions have also reached to impact them. On the other 
hand, the safety net has completely collapsed for the heavily 
indebted middle class. 
  Vahatalo, for his part, writes that long-term unemployment 
is 
not the only factor that has undermined the welfare state. In 
particular, the housing policy has contributed to the 
undermining, since it has never been carried out in a 
goal-directed fashion, he asserts. Instead, market forces have 
taken over in determining policy. 
  Vahatalo also points out that the position of students has 
markedly worsened in recent times. They no longer dare to take 
out student loans because of the high interest rates and 
insecurity about the future job market. Vahatalo warns that this 
defective educational support system may lead again to the 
situation that parents' economic background will determine who 
can continue his studies and who cannot. 
  Poverty also threatens to again become an inherited 
phenomenon. During the good years for the economy, we were able 
to get rid of this trend, but -- according to researcher Raimo 
Parikka, we are now on the way to going back to the old pattern.

<F P=106> [Article by Finance Minister Fridrik Sophusson: "Iceland on </F>
a Cautious Course Toward Europe"] 
  [Text] On 17 June it is 50 years since the Republic of 
Iceland was founded. To mark the occasion the Icelandic finance 
minister assesses the country's economic development and its 
relationship to economic and political cooperation in Europe. 
Even though Iceland is involved in the economic cooperation 
between the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] and EU 
[European Union] countries -- so-called EEA [European Economic 
Area] cooperation -- Iceland is the only Nordic country not to 
have sought EU membership. 
  If one were to describe Iceland's economy from World War II 
up to only a few years ago, the key word is instability. This 
is due first and foremost to the uniformity of industrial and 
commercial life where fishing has been the decisive factor for 
the population. This has often led to violent turbulence and 
the situation in times of recession has often been aggravated 
further by the intervention of the authorities in dubious rescue 
attempts. 
  This instability led among other things to massive inflation 
and major economic swings generally. It almost became a reflex 
action to blame the authorities every time problems reared their 
heads in which people were expecting the politicians to 
intervene. As a result as time passed the authorities' 
involvement in the economy grew steadily. 
  However, the situation has not been as gloomy as this the 
whole time. In the 1960's, for example, major economic reforms 
aiming at greater liberalization were implemented. But it was 
not long before people resorted to the old solutions again. 
People moved away from the path of liberalization, and the 
authorities' intervention in the economy increased again. There 
was hardly an area in which the authorities did not have their 
fingers in the pie. 
  In the wake of growing inflation, which reached its peak in 
the mid-1980's when it topped the 100-percent barrier, saving 
was abandoned completely. People preferred instead to take 
loans on a similar scale. 
  Society's system of values became totally distorted. It was 
a case of spending money as soon as it appeared on the horizon 
-- and ideally a little more money than you actually had. The 
best thing was to borrow money at the negative interest rates 
that burned up on the bonfire of inflation in the course of only 
a few years. These were good times for those who owed money, 
while those people who had saved money were badly hit and some 
of them lost everything they had. It goes without saying that 
those who controlled large amounts of capital had great power in 
Icelandic society. In a society where the majority of the 
financial institutions were state owned these had of necessity 
to lead to a situation in which the politicians felt tempted by 
this power. This was what Iceland was like. 
  In the past few years Iceland's economic policy has been 
revolutionized. The Icelandic coalition government consisting 
of the Independence Party and the Social Democrats that came to 
power in 1991 has made it a point of honor to combat the 
problems of the past. We have endeavored to decrease state 
intervention. The public sector has been rationalized and been 
the target of spending cuts. At the same time the government 
has begun to sell off state-owned companies. The taxation 
system has been completely reorganized with lower levels of tax 
relief and fewer deductions. Domestic and foreign trade, the 
service sector, and the activities of the stock exchange have 
been liberalized to an appreciable extent. The door has been 
opened up to foreign investments. In particular the present 
government has made every effort to bring inflation down to the 
level of our neighbors. This has naturally required close 
consultation between the government and the two sides of 
industry. 
  And now we are beginning to see the light. The economy has 
largely been stabilized. Inflation is down to below the OECD 
average, which at present is around 2 percent. Interest rate 
levels have fallen dramatically, and we are now in line with the 
majority of our trading partners, particularly the Nordic 
countries. From a large deficit in foreign trade in 1991 we 
achieved a surplus in 1993. As a result we have been able to 
deal with an accelerating foreign debt. The shortfall in the 
state's coffers and public debt are also smaller in Iceland than 
in many other places. Finally, there is the prospect that 
economic growth will get under way next year. 
  These have to be described as impressive results, especially 
when we remember that since 1987 the Icelandic economy has 
experienced seven lean years. GNP has remained static -- this 
means that economic growth has been nil. This stagnation has 
been first and foremost due to the cuts in the fishing quotas 
that it was necessary to adopt to protect fish stocks in the 
ocean. In addition fish prices have fallen by 25 percent as a 
result of the wave of recession that has swept through the 
foreign countries closest to us. 
  This stagnation brings with it growing unemployment, for 
example, and for the first time in more than 25 years we are 
able to record an appreciable level of unemployment in Iceland. 
The government has moved to tackle this unemployment through 
the construction of new roads, for example, and lower taxes for 
companies. Unemployment is now at 5.5 percent -- a figure that 
is somewhat lower than unemployment in the rest of Europe. 
  Its historical legacy and its newly won independence have of 
course set their stamp on the young Icelandic Republic's links 
with international cooperation. Geographically Iceland finds 
itself on the boundary between the America and Europe. Like 
Denmark and Norway, Iceland was swift to choose to ally itself 
with the Western Hemisphere in security policy cooperation. Our 
country has no army, but because of our island's strategic 
location we were able to contribute by making available land for 
U.S.-manned NATO bases. 
  A few years later -- in the mid-1950's -- Iceland became an 
active partner in Nordic cooperation that came into being in the 
context of the founding of the Nordic Council in 1952. Nordic 
cooperation has always been of great importance to Iceland. The 
advantages to be gained from Nordic cooperation are obvious, 
especially when there are things that can better be done 
together than by each small country individually. This 
importance will not decrease now that Iceland is facing the 
prospect of -- perhaps -- being the only Nordic country outside 
the EU. 
  Attitudes to international cooperation have gradually 
changed 
over the years. We have increasingly made efforts to promote 
trading cooperation, at the same time as foreign trade has been 
liberalized. We have done this through the GATT agreement, for 
example, EFTA cooperation, free trade agreements with the EU, 
and now most recently the EEA agreement. European cooperation 
is particularly important in that the largest part of Iceland's 
foreign trade is with Europe, but there is also a cultural and 
political belonging. We have, however, chosen to take cautious 
steps. There are various explanations for this decision. 
Iceland is a relatively young Republic; the principle of 
independence is therefore high on the agenda. Another reason is 
the country's dependence on fish. We want to control our fish 
stocks ourselves. This was a realistic view to take at the time 
when the Icelandic Government decided that the time was not ripe 
to seek EU membership alongside the other Nordic countries. The 
colossal changes which the Icelandic economy has experienced 
have brought Iceland closer to the rest of Europe. In the years 
to come Iceland will attach importance to opening up even more 
to the rest of the world and to improving conditions for foreign 
investors. The cautious, but above all viable fisheries policy 
where cuts have been made in fish quotas will show itself to be 
a profitable investment which will bring increased fish catches 
in years to come which will help to put the Icelandic economy 
back on its feet. In addition we have at our disposal huge 
amounts of energy in our waterfalls which make it easier for us 
to offer foreign investors favorable terms for investment in 
Icelandic industry and commerce. This is why we are taking a 
rosy view of the future. 
  We note that the world scene is changing rapidly, even 
viewed 
through Icelandic eyes. I am thinking here first and foremost 
of the other Nordic countries' possible future membership of the 
EU. This will naturally have an effect on Nordic cooperation, 
particularly as far as Iceland is concerned. The Icelanders are 
a Nordic people in Europe, and we wish to continue to be so. 
That is why we are attaching great importance to continued 
close cooperation with the other Nordic countries -- either in 
the framework of the EEA or in the EU context. 
  This fact requires a reassessment of the situation. We will 
look these changes in the face and make our arrangements 
accordingly. The capacity for adjustment of Icelandic society 
knows no bounds.

<F P=106> [Report by Heidi Borud: "Differing Views in Yes and No </F>
Camps"] 
  [Text] While the Europe Movement is jubilant about the 
clear yes victory in Austria, the No to the EU [European Union] 
movement has noted for its information the referendum figures. 
  "I do not believe that the referendum in Austria will be of 
any significance for the Norwegian EU debate, but it would of 
course have been an encouragement if the result had been a no," 
Kristen Nygaard, leader of the No to the EU organization, said. 
  Tor Wennesland, secretary general of the Europe Movement, 
said that the result in Austria is much better than expected. 
Wennesland believes that the foundation of the EEA [European 
Economic Area] agreement as an independent alternative to the EU 
has now been greatly undermined. He also said that the 
possibility of expanding the EU to the east has been 
strengthened by the fact that Austria has said yes to EU 
membership. 
  "I am happy that the nationalists did not manage to achieve 
a 
no majority in the referendum," Wennesland said. 
  "No" general Nygaard is not happy about such comments. 
  "The yes side is now clearly now trying to portray EU 
opponents as nationalists with Nazi views. Such allegations 
must therefore apply to 52 percent of the Norwegian people," 
said Nygaard, referring to Opinion's latest EU membership poll 
that was published in AFTENPOSTEN on Saturday [11 June]. 
  Nygaard thinks that it is mean of the Europe Movement to 
imply that opponents of the EU have Nazi sympathies.

<F P=106> [Report by Harald Stanghelle: "Record Poll for Center </F>
Party"] 
  [Text] The Center Party is enjoying a record level of 
support, but the Progress Party is at rock bottom, Opinion's 
poll on party standings for June shows. 
  The poll was carried out between Monday and Wednesday [6-8 
June] and is based on 1,005 telephone interviews. 
  The Center Party moved up 0.4 percentage points and now has 
support of 18.7 percent. This is the highest level of support 
for the Center Party Opinion has registered since its polls for 
AFTENPOSTEN began seven years ago. 
  The June poll contains another "record": The Progress 
Party's 3.3 percent (a loss of 0.2 percent) is the lowest level 
of support Opinion has measured for this party. But the 
Progress Party has had major problems for a long time, and it 
does not look as if the party is able to rebuild voter 
confidence. 
  The level of support for the Center Party is impressive when 
we analyze the background material to the poll. The party has 
the highest level of voter loyal, at the same time as the Center 
Party is no longer winning voters from the Christian People's 
Party and the Socialist Left Party. This means that the 
successes of the last few months are based on the party's own 
strengths and not on the problems of others, and this fact shows 
that the Center Party has a great mobilization potential. Many 
political commentators had their doubts about such a development 
after the party's sensational election result (18.7 percent) 
last year. It goes without saying that the improvement for the 
party is connected with the European Union [EU] issue, but there 
are good reasons to ask whether there are not other factors that 
are pulling in the Center Party's direction. 
  The other clear no parties are also making gains. Both the 
Christian People's Party and the Socialist Left Party look to 
have stopped the voter leakage to the Center Party, and overall 
there can be little doubt that the no parties are strengthening 
their positions. 
  But the Conservative Party too is able to note an increase 
in 
support. With gains of 1 percent, to 18.8 percent, the party 
can be happy that the Conservative Party overtakes the Center 
Party in the June poll. 
  There are no major changes in the June poll. The only 
exception is the Labor Party, which with losses of 1.8 percent 
now has 36.4 percent support, a little below the election 
result. The party has lost just under 3 percent since March, 
but the Labor Party has been able to maintain the high level of 
voter support from the Storting election. Its loyalty 
percentage remains high (73.5), but its steady losses could be 
the first signal that the Labor Party is about to run into 
problems at the beginning of a hectic EU election campaign.

<F P=106> [Helena Sjogren report: "Bildt Pleased With Yes Victory"] </F>
  [Text] "An important signal to Sweden in the run-up to our 
forthcoming referendum" -- this was [Prime Minister] Carl 
Bildt's comment on Austria's emphatic yes to the European Union 
[EU]. 
  European cooperation that country after country wants to 
join 
is cooperation that Sweden cannot remain outside, Bildt writes 
in a press statement. 
  Bildt interprets the Austrians' massive yes to membership in 
the Union as a wish for influence. Austria does not want to 
stand outside the peace and security order that is now emerging. 
  Opposition leader Ingvar Carlsson also expressed happiness 
with the result of the referendum yesterday: 
  "It is enormously positive bearing in mind that Austria like 
Sweden is a neutral country." 
  According to the opinion polls, there were many people who 
did not make up their minds until the last minute. 
  "This indicates that it is very difficult to measure 
election 
results using opinion polls. In the past I have said that I do 
not believe that we in Sweden can predict election results using 
opinion polls. I am even more convinced now," Ingvar Carlsson 
told TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA. 
  Odd Engstrom (Social Democratic Party), the spokesman for 
the 
Yes to Europe organization, said that Austria's referendum 
result will be an example for Sweden. 
  Eva-Britt Svensson (Social Democratic Party), one of the two 
chairmen of the No to the EU organization, believes that an 
important reason for the Austrian result is the fact that the no 
side in Austria did not have any similar organization. 
  "There has been no organization that the broad opposition to 
the EU in Austria has been able to identify with," she said. 
``That is why this broad opposition has not shown itself in the 
result. 
  ``Instead that right-wing populist, Haider, has frightened 
people off. 
  ``Here in Sweden we conduct the debate differently, using 
objective arguments.'' 
  Svensson does not believe that the Austrian result will 
influence public opinion in Sweden. 
  Marianne Samuelsson, spokesman for the Green Ecology Party, 
which is campaigning against EU membership, was not particularly 
surprised by the yes victory: 
  "It is true that it is probably a bigger majority than we 
were expecting," she told DAGENS NYHETER. "And this will of 
course have an influence on the Swedish people."

<F P=106> [TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA report: "Yes Side Reducing No </F>
Side's Lead"] 
  [Text] The no side still has the upper hand in the battle 
surrounding Swedish membership in the European Union, EU. But 
the difference between yes and no has been halved since 
November. The clearest change in the poll carried out by the 
Central Bureau of Statistics [SCB] when compared with the 
corresponding poll in November is that the no side is losing 
ground. 
  Men still take a more positive view of EU membership than 
women -- 35 percent against 25 percent. However, in both cases 
the proportion of those in favor of membership has increased by 
around 5 percentage points since last November. The proportion 
of those against EU membership is of a similar size in the case 
of both sexes, around 40 percent. Around 23 percent of men are 
undecided, while 33 percent of women do not know how they will 
vote. 
  As far as age is concerned the proportion of those in favor 
of EU membership is greatest among people in the age range 
50-54, around 38 percent. The smallest proportion in favor of 
membership is found among the very old, around 20 percent. The 
highest proportion against EU membership -- around 46 percent -- 
is to be found among first-time voters. 
  Among the supporters of the parties represented in the 
Riksdag the proportion of those in favor of membership has 
increased in the case of all parties with the exception of the 
Left Party. There has been a particularly dramatic improvement 
for EU supports among those who support the Liberal Party. They 
increased from 49.1 percent in November to 63.1 percent in May. 
However, the Moderate Coalition Party has the biggest 
percentage in favor of membership -- 68.5 percent in May, 
compared with 59.9 percent in November. 
  The figures for the other parties show changes as 
follows: 

  -  Social Democrats from 15.7 to 18.7 percent. 
  -  Center 
Party from 17.5 to 26.9 percent. 
  -  Christian Democratic Party from 
17.7 to 26.3 percent. 
  -  New Democracy from 27.1 to 36.0 
percent. 
  -  Left Party from 6.0 to 5.9 percent. 
  -  The Green Ecology 
Party from 14.9 to 9.8 percent. 

  In November the no side had over 50 percent of all party 
supporters with the exception of the Liberal Party and the 
Moderate Coalition Party. In May the no side had an absolute 
majority only in the Left Party and the Green Ecology Party. 
The no side has suffered its biggest losses among Center Party 
supporters, from 58.3 percent to 45.2 percent. The figures for 
the other parties show changes as follows: 

  -  Social Democrats 
from 52.3 to 47.4 percent. 
  -  Liberal Party from 23.7 to 19.1 
percent. 
  -  Moderate Coalition Party from 15.4 to 12.9 
percent. 
  -  Christian Democratic Party from 53.9 to 46.2 
percent. 
  -  New Democracy from 51.9 to 48.3 percent. 
  -  Left Party 
from 84.0 to 83.9 percent. 
  -  Green Ecology Party from 73.2 to 76.5 
percent. 

  The SCB used a random sample of 9,300 people. Of these 
around 20 percent refused to respond, were too ill to respond, 
or could not be contacted. A little under 7,500 replied to the 
SCB's questions. The SCB asked: If we were to have a 
referendum today on Swedish membership in the EU, how would your 
vote: for or against joining? Those interviewed were then 
asked whether they were certain or uncertain in the choice they 
have made. In the don't know category, SCB asked whether people 
were leaning toward a no or a yes. 
  [Report is accompanied by a bar chart that breaks down the 
yes, no, and don't know votes. The figures it gives are as 
follows, with changes in parentheses: 
  Yes -- 30.5 percent (plus 4.5 percent) -- of which uncertain 
9.9 percent (plus 1.0 percent) and certain 20.6 percent (plus 
3.5 percent). 
  No -- 40.0 percent (minus 4.8 percent) -- of which uncertain 
10.8 percent (minus 0.8 percent) and certain 29.2 percent (minus 
4.0 percent). 
  Don't know -- 27.9 percent (plus/minus 0 percent) -- of 
which 
those who lean toward a yes, 6.4 percent (plus 0.2 percent) and 
those who lean toward no, 6.0 percent (plus 0.1 percent)]

  [Text] The Cyprus Government demands an upgrading of the 
political dialogue on the Cyprus issue and an upgrading of the 
support given the UN secretary general by the Security Council 
in the efforts to solve the issue. This is the message conveyed 
by Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis during his contacts with 
the permanent members of the UN Security Council. Mikhailidhis, 
who has been in New York since yesterday, is expected to 
conclude his contacts with all members of the UN Security 
Council tonight. 
  In a statement to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation], 
Mikhailidhis stressed that he feels there is serious thought 
that the UN Security Council is showing strong signs of fatigue 
on the Cyprus issue. Mikhailidhis added that in order to 
overcome Turkish intransigence, specific directives should be 
issued to engage the Security Council and an agenda should be 
drawn up on the basis of which Security Council members will 
move on the direction of the Turkish side. 
  This evening, Mikhailidhis will attend a working dinner with 
UN official Marrack Goulding. Tomorrow, the foreign minister 
will go to Washington where he will meet with U.S. Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis stressed that the Greek 
Cypriot side's demilitarization proposal was, is, and will 
continue to be on the negotiating table. He added that at the 
same time Greece and Cyprus will do everything to safeguard 
Cyprus' independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. 
  The president made this statement this morning at the 
Presidential Palace while receiving trainers and students from 
the Greek Air Force War School and the Greek Navy Permanent 
Officers School, who are on a training trip to Cyprus. Kliridhis 
stressed that the joint defense doctrine between Greece and 
Cyprus is significant for Cyprus. He said that he is satisfied 
because the Greek Navy, Air Force, and Army are present in 
Cyprus because the defense doctrine includes all three.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis described 
President Glavkos Kliridhis' decision to resign if the UN 
Security Council continues discussion of the confidence-building 
measures, as a strictly personal choice. President Kliridhis, 
the spokesman said, weighed the developments very seriously 
before reaching this decision and decided if resigning from the 
presidency would make the future of Cypriot Hellenism easier, he 
would not hesitate to do so. Responding to a question, the 
government spokesman said that if the president resigns, he 
would not seek the presidency again. Kasoulidhis also said that 
if President Kliridhis resigns and calls for new elections, the 
elections would be a popular mandate on a specific issue. 
  Kasoulidhis also said that there has been no reaction from 
the United States or Britain to the letter that President 
Kliridhis sent to President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister John 
Major. The spokesman refused to reveal the contents of the 
letter, saying the letter was confidential.

<F P=106> [From the "Controversy" column by Akranis: "Time for </F>
Responsibility"] 
  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis' resignation threat to 
U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John 
Major if discussion on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] 
continues is certainly not the most serious move that the 
president has ever made. 
  What the president should have done was to brief the 
National 
Council about his intentions and negotiate with the country's 
political leadership about ways to deal with the deadlock, a 
deadlock for which he is greatly responsible. 
  It is inexplicable that while the president briefed the 
National Council about his letters to Clinton and Major, he did 
not mention his resignation threat. It is unacceptable that 
once again the president shows such lack of confidence toward 
the country's political leadership. Nor can the shallow 
argument that his resignation from the presidency is a personal 
issue be accepted. 
  At at time when the Cyprus issue is at a difficult stage, 
the 
National Council has unanimously agreed on future moves, and as 
his policy has borne such bitter fruit, the president's action 
is most unfortunate. His attempt to present himself as a hero 
is vain. If the president felt that his policy bore such bitter 
fruit that he felt the need to resign to disengage Cyprus--as he 
says--from accepting them, he should have done it when he 
accepted the 21 March UN document on the CBM's. 
  The president is well aware that it would not be easy to 
disengage once the CBM's were accepted. His mere resignation is 
not enough. The international community must be persuaded about 
our positions. 
  The president of the republic knew from the outset that the 
National Council opposed his moves. He was aware of political 
opposition to the CBM's but he proceeded with what he considered 
to be correct moves. Now that Cyprus is facing a painful and 
dangerous crossroad, he is threatening to resign. 
  Of course, we are not the ones to show him whether to 
proceed 
in one way or another. We are simply presenting food for 
thought for the people. These thoughts are being stated because 
of the presidency's bad moves. 
  Now is the time for responsibility. Each one must assume his 
own responsibilities in the way he believes is correct and the 
people will judge.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that Serge Abou, 
whom the European Union [EU] assigned to be its Cyprus observer, 
has adopted a one-sided attitude and is making utterly pro-Greek 
Cypriot statements. 
  After his meeting with Gustave Feissel today, President 
Denktas commented on the statement by Abou in connection with 
the implementation of the confidence-building measures. Denktas 
said that it is unacceptable that Abou, an observer, should be a 
party to the issue or that he should try to mislead the EU. 
Denktas said that the latest statement by Abou shows how 
justified the Turkish Cypriots were in refusing to meet with 
him. Denktas said: Influenced by the Greek Cypriots, Abou is 
becoming a party to the issue and trying to influence the EU in 
favor of the Greek Cypriots. This is a regrettable development. 
In fact, it was a mistake to appoint this person. 
  Denktas concluded by saying that Abou was appointed probably 
as a reinforcement to the Greek-Cypriot side.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that the main 
problem of the talks on Cyprus is the inclusion of the concrete 
rights that will be recognized to the Turkish-Cypriot side in 
the document, dated 21 March. President Denktas stressed that 
the document, dated 21 March, or the draft ideas, can be 
changed. He recalled that the UN General Secretariat has made a 
promise to the Turkish Cypriot side on that matter. 
  Denktas received Gustav Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
deputy special representative, at 1600 today. Minister of State 
and Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur; Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and Defense Atay Ahmet Rasit; Under Secretary of the 
Foreign Ministry Ozer Koray; and Presidential advisers Necati 
Munir Ertekun and Ergun Olgun also attended the meeting. In a 
statement after the meeting, which continued for nearly 45 
minutes, President Denktas said: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] We are working on the matter. We 
have been unable to conclude our work today. I could have asked 
Mr. Feissel yesterday to come back on Thursday [16 June]. 
However, I hoped that we would be able to conclude our work 
today. We have not been able to do so. Therefore, he will come 
back at 1000 on Thursday. 
  The situation has not changed. They have put forward 
requests on the access road [to Maras] and the area. Their 
requests are common knowledge. They want us to withdraw one 
mile or one kilometer from each side of that road. We have 
agreed to withdraw up to 400 meters. Furthermore, we have 
agreed that our military troops will not be seen in that area. 
We are holding talks on the question of the transfer of the 
police post, which is known as the police house, from the 
eastern to the western part of that area. The military troops 
must be able to perform their normal duties in the area. In 
view of that, the Greek Cypriot demand for a document on how and 
when crossings will take place is not practical. We are working 
to try to determine whether or not alternate means can be found. 
  As far as we are concerned, the main problem is whether or 
not concrete Turkish-Cypriot rights will be included in the 
document dated 21 March. That is the main problem and we insist 
that the reply is affirmative. Otherwise, we cannot be 
satisfied because a comprehensive agreement has to be signed. 
It should not be divided into two parts. A letter by the UN 
secretary general confirming the rights to be recognized to the 
Turkish-Cypriot side cannot be regarded as a part of the 
comprehensive agreement. That would be meaningless. Such a 
letter cannot be regarded as being of equal strength. It would 
create many legal disputes in the future. 
  I believe that Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis' 
statement that the document, dated 21 March, cannot be changed 
is not valid because it has been described as containing a set 
of draft ideas. Work is carried out on a draft document in order 
that it can be finalized and converted into an agreement. That 
means that certain points can be changed. The UN Secretary 
General has promised us that it can be changed. However, it has 
suggested that the change should be realized through a letter. 
We have responded by saying that what they have described as a 
document on draft ideas should be changed and converted into an 
agreement. [end recording] 
  For his part, Gustav Feissel said after his talks with 
Denktas that they tried to clarify certain points. 
  Following his statement on the talks he held with Gustav 
Feissel, President Denktas assessed the intervention of Serge 
Abou, the European Union's observer on Cyprus, on the 
implementation of the package of confidence-building measures. 
Denktas stressed that Abou was wrong to take sides as an 
observer. He said the following: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] Mr. Abou is reported to have said 
today that he believes that the document, dated 21 March, is 
valid and must not be changed. We did not expect a coordinator 
or an observer to involve himself in the problem in such a clear 
and biased fashion. Some of our officials were undecided as to 
whether or not we should hold talks with him. Considering his 
statement, we thank God that we did not agree to meet him. 
Obviously, he has been influenced by the Greek Cypriots as a 
result of his contacts with them. He has taken sides on a 
matter that does not concern him. Consequently, he has already 
begun to do everything he can to influence the EU in favor of 
the Greek Cypriots. That is a regrettable development. His 
appointment was wrong. It was asked for by the UN secretary 
general on behalf of Glavkos Kliridhis. It was unnecessary. 
Obviously, something was required to reinforce the 
Greek-Cypriot side's approach. 
  That state of affairs is regrettable. The adoption of a 
position by observers to harm one side of the issue is 
unthinkable. We hope that Mr. Abou will not make a similar 
mistake in the future. [end recording]

  [Text] The hearing at the European Court regarding the EU 
[European Union] Commission's appeal against Greece on the 
economic embargo against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] concluded this afternoon. In its appeal, the 
EU Commission was asking for temporary measures against Greece 
in retaliation for its decision. Our correspondent in Brussels 
Kostas Kekis sent the following dispatch: 
  [Begin Kekis recording] The hearing was in front of the full 
session of the European Court. It met behind closed doors and 
examined the EU Commission's appeal for temporary measures 
against Greece for the embargo on Skopje. The meeting lasted 
for over three hours. The representatives of the two sides made 
their arguments and answered questions posed by the European 
justices. In the coming days, the prosecuting officer is 
expected to submit his recommendations. According to the 
court's practice, three to four weeks are necessary before the 
decision can be issued. 
  It should be noted that since the official language of the 
hearing process was Greek, the defense of the EU Commission's 
arguments was assumed by a Greek-speaking French official, 
because the Greek legal officials of the EU's executive body 
would not participate in the hearing, claiming conscientious 
reasons. Finally, it should be noted that the president of the 
European Court rejected a demand by Greek European Parliament 
Deputies Lambrias, Stamoulis and Nianias who asked to take part 
in the hearing in favor of Greece. The European Court's 
president recalled Article 137 of the Court's procedural rule, 
according to his decision, people do not have the right to 
intervene in a trial between the EU Commission and member 
states. Only the member states and EU bodies can participate. 
At the trial, Greece was represented by Ioannis Kranidhiotis, 
Foreign Ministry director general in charge of European issues, 
and professors Skouris, Ioannou and Perakis. [end recording]

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos expressed 
optimism for the outcome of the EU [European Union] Commission's 
appeal to the European Court for temporary measures against 
Greece on the embargo against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Among other things, Venizelos 
said on Athens radio that Greece has strong arguments for the 
European Court to reject the EU commission's appeal. 
Correspondent Nina Asimakopoulou has the following report: 
  [Begin recording] [Venizelos] The Republic of Greece, 
through 
its representatives, has presented all its legal arguments, a 
huge reserve of arguments, and all its political arguments, 
because the issue is primarily political. 
  Our first argument is that the issue is political and one 
that is associated with foreign policy and security in the 
southern Balkans, sources of tension in an area that is already 
tense. As is evident, a similar evaluation of developments 
cannot be done by a judicial body but by a political one, and 
this is why the EU Commission dealt with the issue politically 
through the dispatch of Hans van den Broek, the EU commissioner 
on foreign and security policy. In addition, the EU Commission 
had asked for the opinion of the EU Council of Ministers that, 
typically, was never given. 
  Our second argument is that there is no reason whatsoever to 
consider the issue a priority, because the EU Commission delayed 
any action for over two months by conducting a political 
discussion around this issue. Also, the issue is dealt with 
politically by the United Nations through Cyrus Vance's mission, 
and by United States through the mission of Matthew Nimetz. 
  Our third argument is that there is no excessive use of 
rights deriving from Article 224 of the EU Accord on behalf of 
our country, because this regulation allows the assumption of 
similar measures when there is international tension 
constituting a threat of war. Of course all the above lead to 
the rejection of the EU Commission's appeal that, and here is 
the paradox, it claims harm Skopje, but not the EU, from 
Greece's sanctions, even though there is a very small volume of 
trade between EU and Skopje. 
  [Asimakopoulou] In other words, you are optimistic for the 
outcome of the case, aren't you? 
  [Venizelos] Obviously I am optimistic, because our arguments 
are very strong and this initiative by the EU Commission was 
wrong. 
  [Asimakopoulou] If a sentence is issued against Greece, can 
it be implemented? What would Greece do in such a case? 
  [Venizelos] There is no chance of a such a decision being 
imposed. Such decisions have a symbolic character. Keep in 
mind that we always talk about a process of temporary measures 
that is not the main procedure, and it is not accidental that 
all these have defused the EU Commission's political pressure on 
this issue. [end recording]

  [Text] Shortly before his departure from Ioannina for 
Athens today, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias stressed that 
Greece continues to defend its national sovereign rights in the 
Aegean. Replying to correspondents' questions, Papoulias once 
again expressed opposition to the dispatch of Turkish troops to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Begin Papoulias recording] Greece has always defended its 
national sovereign rights in the Aegean and this position has 
not changed, whether it concerns the state power for the 
extension [of territorial waters] to 12 miles, or the air space, 
where Greece's positions have been firm since the first PASOK 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government. Engaging Balkan 
powers in the massacre of the former Yugoslavia causes 
additional problems instead of alleviating the situation. The 
presence of Turkish forces in Bonsia-Herzegovina indeed makes 
things more difficult and, I believe, particularly causes more 
tension in the inter-Balkan relations. [end recording]

  [Text] During a meeting in Athens today between the 
defense ministers of Greece and Cyprus, Yerasimos Arsenis and 
Konstandinos Iliadhistoward, significant decisions were made 
toward a joint defense doctrine between Greece and Cyprus. 
Details regarding the joint defense doctrine were announced 
after the two defense ministers met in Nicosia last March. 
Today's talks between Arsenis and Iliadhis lasted for three 
hours. They agreed to hold joint military exercises between the 
Greek Armed Forces and the Cypriot National Guard, and construct 
infrastructure projects to promote cooperation between the 
airforce and navy of Greece and Cyprus.

  [Text] Official sources stress that following Sunday's [12 
June] elections for the European Parliament and the significant 
drop in power of the two big parties, the issue of next April's 
presidential election by the current Chamber of Deputies takes 
on new dimensions. 
  First of all, the dramatic fall in PASOK's [Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement] electoral power, despite the attempt to 
"depoliticize" Sunday's election results, has weakened Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou's position within the party. 
Consequently, according to government sources, Papandreou will 
contemplate running for the country's presidency. 
  Given the level of power of the political parties in the 
Chamber of Deputies, the election for a new president would 
require the cooperation of PASOK, which has 170 seats, and 
Political Spring, which has 10 seats. However, this association 
is not possible because if Political Spring Chairman Andonios 
Samaras were to contribute to the extension of the current 
government's term, it would diminish whatever hopes he has to 
draw new support from the conservative faction's pool. 
  If the Political Spring does not make a clear decision or if 
it demands Papandreou's positions before it makes it own 
decisions, this is because Samaras wants to publicly deny his 
assistance to Papandreou in order to increase his own support 
within the electorate. By getting into a confrontation with 
another "established" political leader, Samaras will conclude 
the cycle of "conflicts" with the political leaders, following 
his confrontation with President Konstandinos Karamanlis and 
Konstandinos Mitsotakis, former prime minister and New Democracy 
chairman. 
  KKE [Greek Communist Party] has said that it will not vote 
Papandreou into the presidency, but has not ruled out the 
possibility of supporting another candidate nominated by the 
majority. However, KKE currently holds nine seats in the 
Chamber of Deputies, and this does not solve the problem. 
  As a result, the issue is what will happen with the New 
Democracy parliamentary group, whose leaders cannot cooperate 
with PASOK on the presidential election. 
  Some circles claim that the significant decrease in New 
Democracy's power in Sunday's elections will intensify the 
confrontation within the party, which in turn will increase the 
insecurity of some deputies who want to exhaust their four-year 
term rather than have early elections because of the inability 
to elect a president. The fact that the vote for president in 
the Chamber of Deputies will again be a secret one, will 
certainly help some deputies to vote for PASOK's candidate. 
  However, well-informed sources stress that, besides the fact 
that the above scenario is offensive for the deputies of the 
conservative faction, it will create huge problems for New 
Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert and mainly for Mitsotakis 
who will be blamed for this "unofficial rebellion." 
  It is wise for one to expect that the political leaders' 
decisions regarding the presidential elections will begin after 
the results of the municipal elections and the elections for the 
second level local administrations, as it will be possible to 
evaluate more solid trends of the electorate.

  [Text] It has been announced that Turkey has always been 
careful to refrain from actions that could cause tension in its 
relations with Greece. In reply to a question during his weekly 
news conference today, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman 
said the straining of relations between Turkey and Greece will 
not serve the interests of either country. Ataman recalled that 
during the NATO foreign ministers meeting held in Istanbul, the 
Greek foreign minister informed Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin 
that he shares Turkey's stand on this issue and will be pleased 
to see it implemented. Within this framework, Ataman stressed, 
Turkish planes flew over the Aegean without weapons for some 
time. 
  Ataman continued: This gesture on the part of Turkey has not 
been reciprocated yet. This is extremely important, in that it 
sheds light on the Greek attitude. Under these circumstances, 
it is natural for us to take the measures we deem necessary in 
line with the flight security and operational needs of our 
planes.

  [Text] Ankara, June 14 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin on Tuesday [14 June] said that the extension of the 
mandate for the multinational force is in Turkey's advantage, 
adding in case they are moved out the terrorist PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] organization will have a wider freedom of 
movement in the region. 
  He was speaking at the parliamentarian general council 
meeting where the issue concerning its extension for another six 
months as of June 30 is being discussed. 
  He said it is not a force that has been set up against 
Turkey's will, reminding it was set up initially upon Turkey's 
request in 1991, in conformity with Article 192 of the Turkish 
Constitution. 
  `The terrorist PKK organization is the one who is the most 
against the force. Because if it is dismantled they will have 
an extraordinary freedom of movement in a troubled region. If 
it is lifted Turkey will also lose its support for the fight 
against terrorism in the southeast,' he said. 
  He said the problems in that region do not stem from the 
force but from the embargo imposed on northern Iraq. 
  `Even if the force goes, as long as the embargo is on, 
problems will continue,' he said adding that Iraq's territorial 
integrity is of a great importance to Turkey.

  [Text] Ankara--As a Turkish delegation headed by Foreign 
Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk lobbied in New York to 
convince Turkey's allies regarding the flushing of oil from a 
Turco-Iraqi pipeline, a high-level technocrat said Ankara was 
ready to foot the bill for repairing the damage to the pipeline 
on the Iraqi side. 
  Hayrettin Uzun, who heads Turkey's state pipeline company 
Botas, said Monday [6 June] that Ankara had assured Baghdad that 
it would repair the damage that was caused on the Iraqi side of 
the 986-kilometer (616-mile) trans-Turkey pipeline, Baghdad's 
main oil export artery. 
  The pipeline, which has become the focal point of Turkish 
diplomacy, holds an estimated 12 million barrels of crude oil. 
Turkey says it has already paid for 3.8 million barrels and 
would keep the rest for its own use. 
  The United Nations, however, says that it would incur a loss 
of $80 million if it adopted Turkey's plan. 
  This sum was to go into a UN fund set up to compensate 
victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
  Uzun denied any claim that Turkey had "proposed" to pay 30 
percent of the flushed oil revenues to the UN Sanctions 
Committee, as alleged by a Middle East Economic Survey 
newsletter. 
  While Turkish officials voiced understanding that the three 
to four million barrels owned by Iraq and any subsequent 
flushings "would be fully liable to the mandatory 30 percent 
contribution to the compensation fund plus other sums to offset 
UN costs in Iraq," they have maintained that this is a question 
that should be addressed to Iraq, not to Turkey. 
  Turkey closed down the oil pipeline in 1990, a few days 
after 
Iraq invaded Kuwait. But Turkish officials now argue that the 
oil should be flushed--up to three times--to prevent 
deterioration of the pipeline. 
  "The deterioration would not have happened if we had flushed 
it when we closed down the pipeline," complained Uzun. He said 
that the spoiled oil should be removed "as soon as possible" to 
prevent corrosion, claiming it would be ideal if a political 
decision could be made by the end of June. "If the UN leaves it 
until September, it may be delayed another year. Technically, 
we could start the flushing right away. We have been told that 
there has been no major damage to the pipeline on the Iraqi 
side, but if there has been, we have told them (the Iraqis) that 
we would carry out the repairs ourselves," he said. 
  Uzun hinted that Iraq, which lacks sufficient government 
funds and has lost its sovereignty in the Karkuk area, could not 
be expected to take the necessary steps to repair the pipeline, 
which lies in the northern portion of the country. 
  "I do not even want to think about the consequences of a 
further delay in efforts to save the $2.2 billion pipeline," 
Uzun said, noting that the pipeline was covered by an insurance 
policy that did not include damage caused by deterioration. 
Turkey's losses over the closed pipeline are calculated to be 
$1.5 billion. 
  "If Turkey would have had this money, it could have been 
used 
to initiate major projects," he added. 
<H5>  Uzun: No UNSC Decision Necessary </H5>
  While Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk lobbied 
in New York for a resolution on technical immunity--i.e. that 
the flushing is a technical necessity rather than a breach of 
the UN embargo--Uzun said that a UN Security Council resolution 
may not be necessary. 
  "The flushing is a technical matter. It has nothing to do 
with the embargo. I personally believe that a statement by the 
UN secretary general might be enough," he said. 
  But he firmly denied that Turkey would act independently or 
contrary to any UN decision. "If we had intended to do that, we 
would not have waited for four rounds of talks," he said. Uzun 
also brushed aside any allegations that the flushing of the 
pipeline was linked to a third issue--a reference to the often 
cited linkage between an extension of the mandate for the Poised 
Hammer forces and the flushing of the pipeline. 
  "The pipeline is one of the most important issues in Turkish 
foreign policy. It should be dealt with consistently, not on 
and off," he said. 
  The Botas chief said that Turkey would either store the 
flushed oil or use it for its own domestic consumption. 
  "It certainly will not be offered on the international 
markets," he said. 
  But he added that the storing of the oil could be 
problematic 
in terms of Turkey's limited tank capacity, particularly after 
the first flushing process.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by President Suleyman Demirel: "Security </F>
Relations in the New World Order"] 
  [Text] The events that dramatized the end of the Cold War 
were both welcomed and unprepared for. They generated a tidal 
wave of optimism about the future of international relations. 
Fervent talk about a rapidly changing world was the order of 
the day when we entered the present decade. However, little was 
done to determine and shape the dynamics and scope of the 
change. It was, more or less, taken for granted that it would 
turn out to be for the better. This did not prove to be the case. 
  Accordingly, the creation of a new and desirable 
international system continues to top the political agenda as 
the most challenging task of our times. 
  The erosion by armed conflicts at the regional level of the 
global security edifice, is the most urgent threat which we have 
to confront and to overcome. For, without mutually reinforcing 
regional orders of peace and stability, we cannot put together 
the building-blocks of collective security on the world scale. 
  Europe's new security framework has to be conceived under an 
umbrella of a strengthened world organization. The interlocking 
institutions making up Europe's post-Cold War security 
architecture have, to date, achieved no apparent success. 
  However, it would be unfair to blame the conceptual 
blueprint 
for their failure. Without an adequate supply of fuel in terms 
of political will on the part of its members, no organization 
can make substantial headway towards realizing its aims. Had 
the requisite political will not been in short supply, these 
institutions could have done a lot within the scope of the 
mandates provided to them by the CSCE and the UN on several 
instances during the recent years in connection with some of the 
ongoing crises. 
  Recent events and developments prove that little can be done 
to prevent a further deterioration of the security situation in 
the Euro-Atlantic area if the full weight of NATO's capability 
and assets are not brought to bear on conflict-prevention, 
effective crisis-management and peacemaking. 
  NATO's role should not be confined to declaring readiness 
for 
support to peacekeeping. NATO should act in the name of the 
international community, when mandated by the UN or the CSCE, 
for repelling aggression and rolling back the territorial and 
other consequences alone or in coalition with extra-alliance 
countries or organizations. Moreover, NATO should take the lead 
in negotiating and "extracting" the mandates required to execute 
such functions. The surest way to conflict-prevention is for the 
international community to be able to suppress adventurism 
before it widens. 
  We think that the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) 
may serve as a vehicle for promoting a new cooperative order 
among its participating states by dealing with specific issues 
as outlined in its work plan. 
  Turkey's approach to security rests on the principle of its 
indivisibility. In this respect, we consider the formula 
"Partnership for Peace" as feasible and relevant to the present 
transitional period. Under this formula, the cooperation and 
relationship encompassing all the European, Caucasian and 
Central Asian states will certainly be enhanced. Such an 
arrangement holds more far reaching opportunities than the NACC. 
  While NATO remains vital for European security, the CSCE, as 
a complementary organization, will share the role of improving 
and maintaining stability on the continent. The CSCE will 
continue, as a larger frame, to play a major role in the future 
architecture of Europe together with other international 
organizations such as NATO, NACC, the European Union, the 
Council of Europe and the Western European Union. 
  A European society rooted in a pluralistic democratic system 
of governments that unites our peoples through common ideals and 
principles should be the goal to achieve. 
  The challenge of further spreading and consolidating 
democracy, making sure that the contemporary norms of 
international behavior are respected, and, to that end, the 
adaptation of the global and regional organizations to the needs 
of our times, top our list of priorities. 
  We have witnessed how fragile the sense of freedom which 
comes from throwing off totalitarian rule has turned out to be. 
It is now once again admitted that building democracy is a 
difficult task. We should all engage ourselves more tangibly 
and generously in the efforts of the post-communist countries 
aimed at transforming themselves into genuine democracies. 
  In order that the top priority of propagating democracy may 
be achieved, a series of challenges have to be grappled with 
simultaneously. In this context, I should also mention the need 
to strengthen preventive diplomacy, to curb excessive arms 
transfers, to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, to combat terrorism more effectively. 
  The North Atlantic alliance has been in the forefront in 
adapting itself to the post-Cold War environment. In fact, this 
process of rapid adaptation started following the sweeping 
changes during 1988 in the CSCE countries. 
  NATO took on board bold and far reaching decisions at its 
Copenhagen and London meetings with a view to responding 
adequately to the challenges. 
  The search for a new role and for joining arms with our 
former adversaries took a distinctive shape at the NATO summit 
held in Rome in November 1991 with the adoption of the 
alliance's new strategic concept. 
  The creation of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council 
(NACC) 
at the first NACC ministerial in December 1991 coincided with 
the demise of the Soviet Union and with the appearance of new 
partners on the international scene. 
  These new partners gained their long sought but hardly 
expected independence and sovereignty in a very short span of 
time. The North Atlantic alliance and individual allies tried 
their best in helping our new partners to overcome the difficult 
period of transition and state building. Both the expertise of 
each allied country as well as financial resources have been 
made available to our partners. NACC has been instrumental in 
this process. It not only provided them with a forum for 
intense consultation on security related issues and for solving 
potential crises but also devised tangible programs for 
cooperation on key topics. 
  NACC work programs developed with the participation of all 
partners have made substantial contributions by addressing 
important specific needs of our partners like defense 
conversion, peacekeeping, crisis management, information 
exchange and access to NATO science programs. 
  The alliance at its last Brussels Summit adopted the 
Partnership for Peace (PFP) concept and invited all NACC 
partners as well as other CSCE countries willing and able to 
contribute to the program to join it in a new and qualitatively 
enhanced form of partnership. 
  Up to date, 20 countries signed the PFP framework document 
and displayed in unequivocal terms their determination to 
benefit from this new form of partnership and cooperation. 
Others are expected to join in the coming weeks. 
  PFP with its non-discriminatory approach to all potential 
partners, yet providing room for self-differentiation, is 
suitable for all. Furthermore, presentation documents to be 
presented by partners and individual partnership documents to be 
prepared jointly by the partner concerned and the alliance make 
this new program flexible enough to meet the specific needs and 
capabilities of each partner. 
  This basic feature of the PFP should be preserved and no 
special status or privileged position should be accorded at the 
outset to any prospective partner. The pace and intensity of 
the cooperation with each partner within the framework of the 
PFP will largely depend on the capability and willingness of the 
partner concerned. Thus the relations between each partner and 
the alliance will undoubtedly have specific features. 
  In this era of interlocking institutions it will be futile 
to try to evaluate contributions of several European and 
Transatlantic institutions. Each played its fair share in the 
post-Cold War configuration. The European Union, the EU and the 
CSCE made substantial contributions. Nonetheless, one can 
easily assert that NATO, with its unique capabilities and its 
integrated structure, has been on the forefront in extending its 
hand of friendship to our partners. It has also been first to 
set up new mechanisms geared towards enhanced cooperation like 
the NACC and the PFP. 
  Times of change are fraught with new challenges and 
uncertainties. 
  The world order as defined by the parameters of the Cold War 
has disappeared. The international community is faced with a 
new type of security challenge as witnessed in the former 
Yugoslavia and the Caucasus. 
  Ethnic tensions and long suppressed animosities resurfaced. 
  It is very difficult, if not impossible to argue that the 
international community and its institutions, be it the UN, NATO 
or the European Union, have shown the necessary resolve and 
determination in the face of these new challenges in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and Azerbaijan. 
  In both cases the international community has let the 
aggressors go unpunished and capitalize on their gains, achieved 
through invasion, murders, rape, "ethnic cleansing." 
  When use of force was necessary, the international community 
shied away from employing it until when it was too late. Thus 
the credibility of all international organizations from the UN 
to NATO to CSCE has been enormously eroded. 
  Potential aggressors drew their lessons. They now believe 
that "aggression pays" They have seen that the international 
community can enter into futile debate and sit back and let the 
territorial integrity and even the sovereignty of its fellow 
members like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Azerbaijan be trampled 
upon. 
  The stakes in Bosnia are much higher than those related to 
the survival of the Bosnian state and its people. They include 
the validity of our hope to do away with ethnic and religious 
warfare in the future. The betrayal of Bosnia as a 
multi-cultural, multi-ethnic state invalidates this hope, and 
with it the fundamental principal of the Western institutions. 
If we allow aggression and adventurism to get away with the 
crimes they have committed in Bosnia, the post-Cold War disorder 
may worsen. Should Bosnia fail, not only the Balkans, but the 
whole of Europe will bear the bitter aftereffects. 
  Another destabilizing development is the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. 
  Huge amounts of conventional arms deliveries to some 
specific 
areas and countries is yet another source of instability, at 
least for their neighbors. Nevertheless, the interdependent 
world we live in does not permit us the luxury of closing our 
doors to the outside world and living peacefully in our affluent 
societies. Any crisis is bound to affect us eventually. 
  Turkey, located in an unstable region, feels this threat 
perhaps more imminently than others. 
  Finally, the ever-increasing gap between the South and North 
is another potential source of instability, the effects of which 
are being felt by mass migration and by the problems inherent in 
it. 
  If the international community has the political will and 
acts accordingly, these negative trends could be reversed in 
medium to long term. However, we should shed away the present 
inertia and refrain from putting undue emphasis on petty 
internal bickering. 
  A European security architecture is beginning to emerge. It 
should be based on the long cherished principle of interlocking 
institutions in which all actors will have important roles. 
Nonetheless, the international community needs to be more aware 
than it is today of the problems of peace and security in a 
turbulent world. It needs the political will to confront the 
dangers and the determination to acquire the necessary 
institutional and financial resources, or to put into use the 
existing unique capabilities of the North Atlantic alliance. It 
goes without saying that NATO will need a clear mandate from the 
UN and/or the CSCE for non-article "V" contingencies. 
  Partnership and cooperation between all security related 
institutions are vital to safeguard common interests. 
  Tolerance, cooperation, solidarity, non-discrimination and 
an 
equitable sharing of responsibilities and burdens must be the 
cornerstones of a system based an the principles of the UN 
charter and the Helsinki Final Act. 
  NATO is needed and able to address the new security 
challenges. 

  -  It must provide security and stability in a 
world that has become more unstable. 
  -  It must prevent, manage and 
resolve crises and conflicts. 
  -  It must prevent Europe from 
sliding back into renationalization and fragmentation and into 
the destructive logic of alliances and counter-alliances. 
  -  It 
must enhance its cooperation with its new partners. 
  -  It must keep 
transatlantic relations working smoothly and effectively. 
  -  It 
must ensure the effective implementation of existing arms 
control agreements and the full compliance to their provisions 
by all parties. 

  None of these challenges can be met without the alliance. 
  First, the transatlantic relationship is the most stable 
geopolitical asset in the world. It brings together two 
principal centers of democracy and liberalism. A more stable 
world cannot be achieved without an alliance of these power 
centers. Our partners turn to NATO because of their 
appreciation that NATO and only NATO can provide the stability 
they need. 
  Second, regarding the need for effective management of major 
conflicts, diplomacy is deemed to fail if it is not backed by a 
powerful politico-military instrument. Needless to say that 
NATO needs the joint political will of its members to act. 
However, once the political will is there, there is no other 
effective instrument than NATO. 
  Third, one of the effective achievements of NATO has been to 
put an end to the centuries-old habit of European power politics 
by providing an Atlantic framework. By contrast, the 
dissolution of the alliance and the disengagement of the United 
States could undermine the European integration process. This 
would be damaging not only for the allies on both sides of the 
Atlantic, but would also gravely affect the political and 
economic transition of partner countries. 
  Fourth, NATO provides the key forum for coordinating and 
harmonizing transatlantic policies in the broadest sense. This 
role should be maintained and enhanced. 
  Finally, NATO is the only mechanism to deal with new 
challenges, as these challenges exceed the capabilities of any 
single nation.

  [Text] Istanbul, June 15 (A.A.) -- The trial of 13 
employees of the OZGUR GUNDEM newspaper, accused of being 
members of the separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] organization began on Tuesday [14 June]. 
  In the State Security Court here, those questioned included 
editor in chief Gurbetelli Ersoz and director Ali Riza Halis, 
who were under detention. 
  Ersoz said during his testimony that the trial was 
politically motivated and did not have a reasonable base. 
Reading his 16-page defense, he said that since the first day 
it was published the newspaper was subjected to pressures. 
  All defendants denied the accusations made against them and 
asked for their release. 
  The court decided to release the defendants. 
  The indictment against the defendants demands 22.5 years 
each 
for Ersoz, Halis, Cetin, Kisanak and Ozsokmenler and five years 
for the others.

  [Text] Ankara--According to the latest monthly Human Rights 
report prepared by the human rights association IHD, Turkey 
again had nothing to boast about in terms of its human rights' 
record. A total of 643 people were reported to have lost their 
lives as a result of clashes between the outlawed Kurdistan 
Workers' Party (PKK) militants and the government security 
forces. In a press conference to announce the May report, the 
chairman of the IHD, Akin Birdal, said: "Turkey is condemned to 
live with the malfunction of its legal system. The ignorance in 
Turkey of extra-judicial executions, tortures, crimes of 
conscience and the ban on a free press and publications presents 
a very thought-provoking picture that gets a lot of attention in 
Western countries." He went on to say that political parties 
now look favorably on constitutional change but added that all 
changes must comply with international law. 
  Birdal said that the attempt to democratize the Constitution 
of 1982 was a test of the Turkish Parliament's commitment to 
human rights, in particular as regards the 152 articles that 
currently restrict freedom of expression in the country. 
Stressing that all views have to be represented freely, he went 
on to say: 
  "Therefore Article 8 of the anti-terror law has to be lifted 
immediately and urgently. If all parties are encouraged to 
participate in the democratization process, then this article 
has to be eliminated." He pointed to the 98 journalists, 
writers and publishers presently in jail for the violation of 
the "crimes of conscience" article and explained the heavy fines 
they were forced to pay as follows: "Obviously the government 
wants to pay its domestic and foreign debts from the fines 
exacted from journalists and writers." 
  According to the IHD report, Turkey's human rights abuses 
for 
the month of May included: 
  Disappeared while in custody: 28; died as a result of 
torture 
while in custody or summarily executed: 31; unsolved murders: 
19; journalists, writers, publishers, union members, scientists, 
and deputies currently in jail: 98 (with total possible 
sentences of 348 years); banned publications: 50. Seven 
publications and democratic organizations were raided by the 
police. Villages and settlements evacuated and burned: 74. 
Claims of torture: 13. 
<H5>  A delegation of the IHD to North Iraq. </H5>
  On the initiative of the IHD, trips by various organizations 
to examine the situation of the Kurds in Northern Iraq are being 
planned. The purpose of the trip planned for June 13-16 is to 
investigate the people who have emigrated there from Turkey. 
The IHD chairman said: "Whatever the causes of the migration 
might be, the effects of such a displacement of population are 
well-known from its precedents." He said that health, 
education, food, and shelter were all problems for people forced 
to migrate, and all of them needed to be examined on the spot so 
that the necessary reports could be made. 
  Apart from the IHD delegation, members of many Turkish human 
rights organizations, judicial associations and political 
parties will take part in the proposed visit.

  [Text] The Turkish Armed Forces have launched a wide-scale

established by the Workers Party of Kurdistan and other illegal 
organizations such as the Revolutionary Left Organization and 
the Turkish Workers-Peasants Liberation Army. A group of 
HURRIYET correspondents are following the operation, during 
which the 3,188 meters mountain will be thoroughly searched. 
  Brigadier General Bahtiyar Turker, commander of the 4th 
Armored Brigade, is in command of the operation. The terrorist 
hideouts are being destroyed one after the other. It has been 
reported that 60 terrorists have been killed on Munzur Mountain 
in the past month. Turkish military units are searching every 
inch of the heights. Colonel Kazim Baturalp, commander of the 
Gendarmerie Regiment in Erzurum; Major Hicabi Bas, director of 
the Operations Department for Law and Order in the region; and 
Major Ibrahim Turan, director of the Intelligence Department in 
the region, are assisting Gen. Turker. In addition to the 
gendarmerie commando units, infantry and tank units are 
participating in the operation. Col. Baturalp said: "The 
treacherous elements will not be allowed to shelter in our 
territory. Our heroic troops, who are engaged in hand-to-hand 
combat operations, will destroy them. The Armenians will not be 
able to achieve their objectives. We are determined to end the 
despicable situation with the help of the military troops, 
police units, and citizens. The treacherous elements will 
either surrender or die."

  [Text] The treasury, which has become very popular among 
investors because of the bonds it has issued with extremely high 
interest rates in order to reactivate the internal borrowing 
market, will have to pay an enormous debt in the next four 
months. It has to pay $1.66 billion for foreign debts and 261.5 
trillion Turkish lira [TL] for internal debts from June to 
September 1994. 
  The treasury is expected to pay $510 million for Turkey's 
foreign debts in June. That will be the highest installment 
from June to September. August will be the most critical month 
in the repayment of Turkey's internal debts. The treasury will 
pay TL134 trillion for internal debts and TL18 trillion for 
salaries in that month. 
<H5>  Internal Debts </H5>
  According to the treasury's plans on the flow of currency, 
TL40 trillion will be paid for internal debts and 18 trillion 
for salaries in June, 40.5 trillion will be paid for internal 
debts and 18 trillion for salaries in July, 134 trillion will be 
paid for internal debts and 18 trillion for salaries in August, 
and 47 trillion will be paid for internal debts and 18 trillion 
for salaries in September. 
  Plans were made to allocate TL74 trillion for capital and 
interest payments in August. However, issuing TL40 trillion 
worth of bonds at an interest rate of 50 percent and the 20 
trillion interest on the bonds have increased that amount to 
TL134 trillion. 
  Treasury officials have said that additional borrowing will 
be unavoidable for the repayment of Turkey's internal debts in 
August. 
<H5>  Foreign Debts </H5>
  Treasury will pay $1.660 billion for Turkey's foreign debts 
by the end of September. It will pay $510 million in June, $320 
million in July, $400 million in August, and $430 million in 
September. 
  Consequently, the funds that will be secured from the IMF 
and 
the World Bank will be mostly used for the repayment of Turkey's 
foreign debts.

  [Text] Ankara--Turkey's troubled balance of payments 
position worsened in the first quarter of the current year as 
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller continues to promise to produce a 
balanced account by the end of the year as part of her economic 
recovery program. 
  The current account deficit soared from $925 million in the 
first quarter of 1993 to $1.135 billion in the corresponding 
period of this year, an increase of 22 percent, official figures 
revealed on Thursday [9 June]. 
  The Central Bank said that the current account deficit 
widened despite a smaller foreign trade gap. It said Turkey's 
foreign trade deficit in the January-March period dropped from 
$2.207 billion last year to $1.814 billion this year, a decline 
of 17.8 percent. 
  Net unrequited official transfers declined from $183 million 
to $89 million. Direct foreign investment went down from $94 
million last year to $51 million this year, a fall of 45.7 
percent. 
  Turkey's foreign debt repayment amounted to $1.940 billion 
in 
the first quarter of this year, compared with $1.736 billion 
twelve months ago.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "Industrialists Take a Defiant </F>
Stand"] 
  [Text] This time the government is facing some concrete and 
potentially damaging defiance by the industrialists, who say 
they will no longer repay their debts to the banks in view of 
Turkey's growing economic problems. 
  The industrialists argue that the government's mistaken 
policies on taxes and interest rates have landed them in their 
current indebtedness, and thus they too will become militant and 
will not honor their debts. 
  This is bad news for the government, which has been trying 
to 
overcome all kinds of problems on many fronts. 
  The coalition government set up between the True Path Party 
(DYP) and the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP) is on the 
rocks. There are too many fundamental differences between the 
partners. The coalition parties are facing serious problems 
inside their own parliamentary groups. Thus the going is very 
tough for Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister 
Murat Karayalcin. 
  Besides that, Ciller is confronted by criticism from all 
sides that she has failed to manage the economy properly. Until 
recently the problem was whether the government was making 
mistakes in fiscal and monetary policies. Now the problem has 
become an economic crisis where the country is plunged into 
recession and high inflation. 
  This has prompted major industrial groups to say the 
economic 
crisis today is unmatched in the 70-year-old history of the 
Republic. 
  But now the economic crisis taking a turn for the worse as 
Ciller displays complete incompetence in facing the challenges. 
Industrial giants have started laying off workers in view of 
falling demand. There are estimates that in the past two months 
nearly 350,000 have become redundant. As unemployment grows, 
consumption falls, and so do prospects of the increased sales 
necessary to bring us out of the recession. 
  So the prime minister tells the industrialists to start 
exporting. Yet we see that exporting under current conditions, 
with high interest rates on bank credits as well as a lack of 
government incentives for foreign trade, has become mission 
impossible. Ciller cannot tell the industrialists simply to 
sell their goods abroad without providing cheap loans for 
financing inputs and without meaningful incentives. 
  So all avenues are closed to industrialists for the time 
being, and the incompetence displayed by the government suggests 
that it lacks the ability to do much. 
  All the government could do was to try to save its own skin 
by further complicating internal market conditions in borrowing 
nearly 30 trillion TL [Turkish lira] from the nation through 
treasury bond sales in the past two weeks, at a net three month 
interest of 50 percent. That means in three months time the 
government has to pay back 45 trillion to the public... This has 
pushed up credit rates and thus halted investments, while 
increasing the interest rates of existing debts. 
  Furthermore, the government, in trying to close the huge 
budget gap, has introduced new taxes for corporations, which has 
further angered companies already pushed for hard cash. Thus 
the industrialists were forced to confront the government. In 
June many business concerns who work on bank credits have to pay 
back the interest payments on their loans. They tentatively 
decided on Monday not to make any repayments to the banks as an 
act of defiance. Now the banks will have to confiscate their 
factories or just throw in the towel and ease the credit 
conditions. 
  This is a dangerous turn of events. Soon the workers and the 
industrialists will all be confronting the Ciller 
administration. Will she survive all this? We will see in the 
near future...

  [Text] Kirsehir, June 15 (A.A.) -- The 1,300 workers of the 
Petlas tire factory launched a two-day hunger strike on Tuesday 
[14 June], to protest the government's decision to close and 
privatize their plant. 
  The ANATOLIAN Agency learned that the workers began their 
action in front of the Petrol-Is trade union office and stated 
that they were categorically against the closure of their plant. 
  `We are against the closure of the only national company 
which manufactures aircraft tires and the only strategic 
national company,' the workers said. 
  The government decision is in line with its April 5 economic 
measures package. 
  Of the striking workers, eight will hold their strike in 
capital Ankara as a symbolic gesture. 
  Confederation of Turkish Trade Unions (Turk-Is) treasurer 
Enver Tocoglu said that it was possible to increase the capacity 
of Petlas by 30 percent, by a 30,000-dollar investment. 
  He also recalled that the economic package led to the laying 
off of 4,959 workers in the northwestern city of Bursa. 
  Petrol-Is trade union's leader Adnan Ozcan said that their 
action will last three days in Ankara and two days in this 
central Anatolian city of Kirsehir and no production will take 
place in their plant during the strike. 
  `We are warning. You cannot close Petlas. If it is closed, 
the hunger strike will become a death strike,' he said. 
  Ozcan said that they opposed the closure of their plant for 
political reasons.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Traditional Parties Face a Tide </F>
of Rejection -- Abstainers, Extremists, Blank and Void Ballot 
Papers: The Party of Those Who Reject `The System' Has a 
Majority in Wallonia and Brussels"] 
  [Text] Sunday's [12 June] European elections were marked by 
an indescribable electronic fiasco (which drove [Liberal 
Reformation Party president] Jean Gol to compare it to a 
Corsican situation). But the elections broke on most of the 
traditional parties like a tidal wave in both the north and 
south of the country. With 10 percent absenteeism, 10 percent 
blank or invalid ballots, and 10 percent of the votes going to 
the extreme right, the "rejection party" now has a majority, 
even, if not above all, in the French-speaking college. This 
creates a totally new and worrying situation which must be 
answered by the traditional parties both in the majority and 
opposition. And nearly all these parties suffered in 
yesterday's vote. 
  For example in Flanders, the CVP [Christian People's Party] 
lost 6.8 percent in comparison with the 1989 European elections, 
but climbed 0.4 percent when compared with the last 
parliamentary elections. 
  The SP [Dutch-speaking Socialist Party] also fell back (17.7 
percent, minus 2.3 percent), but avoided the worst, primarily 
due to Louis Tobback's good score among the preference votes. 
  However, in Flanders it is the poor performance of the VLD 
[Flemish Liberal Democrats] which is the big event. With three 
seats and 18.4 percent (up 1.3 percent), [VLD president] Guy 
Verhofstadt's party is very far from the score he dreamed of (30 
percent) and which was regularly promised him by the opinion 
pollsters. They too will have to ask themselves questions. 
  Is the VLD dead before it has lived? In an interview with LE 
SOIR, Herman De Croo [VLD] distanced himself from the 
ultraliberal program defended by Verhofstadt. 
  The other big victim in the elections is of course the PS 
[French-speaking Socialist Party]. Falling to 30.4 percent 
(minus 8.11 percent) and losing two seats, Busquin's party could 
nevertheless be tempted to say: That could have been worse. 
Still, Jose Happart's [head of PS candidates] personal 
performance and the fact that many PS voters have apparently 
deserted the party to join the extreme right are two factors 
which will not make life any easier for the party. Watch out 
for a split? 
  The PSC [Social Christian Party] is certainly the coalition 
party which emerged from the ordeal with the least damage, 
recording a drop of 2.2 percent in comparison with 1989. In 
Brussels it got its fingers fairly well burnt, as expected after 
the scandals which implicated Jean-Louis Thys and the 
Demaret-Vanden Boeynants duo, and the party just lost its 
position as second biggest party in Wallonia (by 6,000 votes). 
It consoled itself by taking the first European seat devolved 
to the German-speakers. Therefore it can claim that it equals, 
in seats at least, the performance of the PRL-FDF [Liberal 
Reformation Party-French-speaking Front], which was finally 
credited with 24.3 percent. A score subject to caution, 
according to Jean Gol, who was astonished at the "disappearance" 
of thousands of votes. 
  [PSC president] Gerard Deprez went through every possible 
mood yesterday. In the morning, in a state of extreme 
irritation, he could not find words hard enough to berate the 
colleagues who did not get involved at his side during the 
campaign. In the afternoon the president's smile returned when 
he found that he personally had got 97,000 preference votes, or 
20,000 more than in 1989. Suddenly he decided to launch his 
candidacy for a fifth term as president. 
  His most serious challenger will be former minister Raymond 
Langendries who positions himself as the candidate for renewal. 
  It is a theme repeated at Ecolo, at a time when the Greens 
are also asking themselves questions about their setback (13 
percent, minus 3 percent). 
<H5>  Like in Italy? </H5>
  Beyond these minor and major new factors in traditional 
politics, an essential question remains: How to counter the 
extreme right which won 10 percent of the votes and a seat in 
Wallonia and Brussels, due to fear, disgust, rejection of the 
political system or xenophobia?
