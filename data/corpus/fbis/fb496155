<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F>
Federico Guiglia; place and date not given: "Fini: Let Us Move 
to a Presidential System Now" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE 
introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- First Republic, farewell. Having 
(successfully) gotten two elections behind it, the Freedom 
Alliance is now setting its sights on a grand reform of the 
state. "The time for a presidential system has come," [National 
Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini said in this interview with IL 
GIORNALE. "We are initiating a parliamentary debate on the 
direct election of the president." But meanwhile a test of 
strength is under way between [Prime Minister] Berlusconi and 
[League Secretary] Bossi, and the majority has split in the 
Senate over the decree to salvage the RAI [Italian Broadcasting 
Corporation]. As though that were not enough, [Interior 
Minister] Maroni has proposed the "integration" of Forza 
Italia, the National Alliance, and the Northern League. 
  [Guiglia] Is a great "Freedom Party" about to be formed in 
our country, as in America? 
  [Fini] The proposal made by Maroni needs to be further 
detailed, but must certainly be encouraged. The government must 
govern, and it needs the utmost cooperation among its allies. 
But their backgrounds and identities are different and cannot 
be nullified. The important thing now, right away, is to create 
electoral and administrative cartels. We and Forza Italia have 
done so, also in the north, whereas the League is going it 
alone. And it is making a mistake. 
  [Guiglia] Berlusconi is demanding a "clarification" from 
Bossi. Is it their own affair or does it concern the whole of 
the majority? 
  [Fini] Each political group has its own autonomy, and there 
cannot and must not be any interference in internal party 
debates. Having said that, the prime minister is entitled to 
demand from his coalition partners a clear position, which is 
essential to the stability of the majority. 
  [Guiglia] But in the Senate Forza Italia, not the League, 
voted for [former Prime Minister] Ciampi's decree to salvage the 
RAI, together with Communist Renewal. Is there a test of 
strength on the way between the government partners over the 
media too? 
  [Fini] There will be no test of strength, because I am sure 
that in the next few days it will be easy to find a common 
stance on the issue. The National Alliance has no intention of 
dismantling the RAI. But there is a large difference between 
dismantling and approving a watertight measure. I am sure that 
Forza Italia's future options will no longer be in tune with 
those of the Left, as unfortunately happened in the Senate. 
That decree must be modified. the RAI's wise men are neither 
representative nor guarantors -- as they should be -- of 
pluralism within that public service. 
  [Guiglia] Berlusconi is experiencing a honeymoon with the 
voters. Did you, as his ally, feel somewhat "neglected" on 12 
June? 
  [Fini] For us that day's positive vote is a starting point, 
not the electoral target of the Italian Right. We will work to 
make ourselves even more clearly identifiable by the public, 
through a presidential system, which we will now make the 
subject of a debate in Parliament; economic liberalism combined 
with social solidarity, and the renewal of public 
administration, from the ethical viewpoint, too. 
  [Guiglia] The National Alliance has a secretary, but does 
not 
give the impression of having a leadership class. Is this the 
weak spot of Italy's Right? 
  [Fini] There would be no leader unless he were flanked by a 
substantial group of officials. Nobody is so presumptuous as to 
do things entirely by himself. We have 17 members in the 
government, either as ministers or as under secretaries. We 
have another five who are chairmen of parliamentary committees 
and two deputy speakers of Parliament. Do I need to go on? 
  [Guiglia] Yes: Who is your "deputy?" 
  [Fini] There is no one deputy; we have four or five. 
  [Guiglia] Who are they? 
  [Fini] I cannot say; otherwise the other six or seven will 
get angry. 
  [Guiglia] When will you convene the National Alliance 
congress? 
  [Fini] Before the end of the year, at the same time as the 
MSI [Italian Social Movement] congress. There must be an 
operational and organizational agreement between the National 
Alliance and the MSI. The Alliance no longer consists solely of 
MSI members: There are Catholics, Liberals, Republicans. Then 
we need to update our policies to tae into account particpation 
in government, reform, the electoral law, developments on the 
Left , plus all that has happened in recent months. 
  [Guiglia] Will you also discuss the greatest statesman of 
the 
century? 
  [Fini] I no longer express any judgments about the past. 
  [Guiglia] Is this an embarrassing way of eliminating it? 
  [Fini] It is a way of eliminating polemics and artificial 
disputes over the Alliance policies, which have nothing to do 
with the past. 
  [Guiglia] Israel has placed the MSI members in the 
government 
under observation. When will they emerge from quarantine? 
  [Fini] I can very well understand the Israelis' sensitivity. 
Foreign Minister Peres said that he will judge our ministers on 
what they do. This is the greatest reassurance that we could be 
given. The facts will speak for themselves. 
  [Guiglia] Will the PPI [Italian Popular Party] help you in 
the Senate? 
  [Fini] That depends entirely on them. I foresee not their 
joining the majority, but their ability to adopt responsible 
positions different from those of the progressive forces in each 
instance. 
  [Guiglia] Who is best: D'Alema, Veltroni, or Cacciari 
[candidates to succeed Occhetto as Democratic Party of the Left 
secretary]? 
  [Fini] They are all the same. As long as it remains 
illiberal and continues systematically to denigrate its 
adversaries, the Left will not go anywhere. This, even if it 
changes, and keeps changing, its secretaries.

<F P=106> [Report by Riccardo Luna: "Bordon Resigns, Del Turco </F>
Resigns Again"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- There is something comical even in a 
defeat. Del Turco's resignation, for example. He had already 
handed it in two weeks ago, but nobody realized. Not a line was 
written about the secretary of the glorious Socialist Party 
[PSI]. However, Del Turco did not lose heart, and yesterday he 
once again formally announced: "I am resigning as from today." 
He then claimed the distinction of having kept the party alive 
when everyone else had pronounced it dead. However, after the 
European elections, the PSI is as alive as a mineral can be. 
With its votes added to those of Democratic Alliance [AD], it 
obtained 1.7 percent. In fact, yesterday former AD coordinator 
Willy Bordon also resigned. "Our result is truly disappointing, 
but I will not give up," the former PDS member explained, 
attempting to reassure his voters ("there are 100,000 of them in 
Italy overall"). The next step? "A great center-left force, 
distinct from the PDS." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Petrini: "Pension Blitz Ready: Only for </F>
Those Over 65 Starting 1 January"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [Prime Minister] Berlusconi's pensions 
remedy is about to be administered to the Italian people. After 
the controversy created by the Constitutional Court ruling, 
which revealed a huge gap in the welfare budget, a major 
structural reform of the welfare system is beginning to take 
shape. This operation will go ahead irrespective of whatever 
solution the government will find to the INPS [National Agency 
for Social Security] gap. 
  Economic ministers are already examining a detailed plan for 
pension reform that they could include in next year's finance 
bill. 
  The idea being considered by the government envisions 
raising 
the retirement age to 65 for men and 60 for women starting 1 
January 1995. This measure would be coupled with the raising of 
the minimum requirement for an old-age pension from 35 to 40 
years. According to a plan drawn up by experts and currently 
being examined by the government, the total sum gained by these 
two measures would permit savings of 4,191 billion lire starting 
in 1995 and would permit the INPS to pay out 254,000 fewer 
pensions. In 1996 savings would total 7,465 billion lire and 
387,000 fewer pensions would be paid. The year after that 
savings would total 12,031 billion lire and 611,000 fewer 
pensions would be paid. By the year 2010 estimated savings 
would be 34,017 billion lire. 
  Public Administration Minister Giuliano Urbani referred to 
reform of the pension system when he put forward three 
alternatives for resolving the problem: "To raise the 
retirement age to the European average of 65, to lower the level 
of pensions, or to seek a combination of these two solutions." 
Urbani's remarks, though very cautious, were enough to prompt a 
protest from the trade unions: "My sharp opposition to such an 
option," Silvano Miniati, of the pensioners' union, said 
sarcastically, "is based solely on social considerations. If, 
apart from introducing the obligation to continue working until 
the age of 65, the right to do so were also guaranteed, my 
opposition would be considerably attenuated...." [passage

<F P=106> [Commentary by Enzo Roggi: "Return of the Long Wave"] </F>
  [Text] The center-right voters who in March decided to 
place their trust in the Berlusconi coalition have decided not 
to turn back, while another faction has heard and heeded the 
call of a victorious novelty rich in resources and with a 
rampant image. In other words, this is a confirmation of the 
tendency to entrust the heritage of the First Republic to forces 
which are at the same time new in appearance and but the same in 
social and political substance. 
  Within the context of this tendency there was to be 
expected, 
and there has been, a gain on the part of the leading group -- 
Forza Italia -- which not only promoted the new alignment but 
granted it substance, visibility, and propaganda (promoted with 
disproportionate means on a scale never before seen in an 
election campaign). This advance occurred to the detriment of 
its government allies -- of the National Alliance, the far-right 
wing, despite its efforts to impart to the Berlusconi initiative 
the impetus and the spirit of an electorate that considers 
itself the breakthrough vanguard. And the League, too, has lost 
ground -- that is, the coalition's most autonomous and critical 
movement which, as such, seemed out of tune with the 
consolidation of the newly established government framework. 
  Overall, Berlusconi has received the confirmation he wanted 
-- achieved under the best psychological conditions and thanks 
to a deployment of resources that scandalized impartial 
observers but that must have attracted many vacillating voters. 
  Accepting the fact that no thinking person could have 
expected a reversal of the tendencies expressed in March, and 
that such a radical reversal of the political balances could 
only, and can only, entail lengthy time periods and experiments, 
it must be noted that the progressive alignment basically 
withstood the test, with different kinds of variations within it 
that bear witness to the reality of a variety of forces that 
must be exploited. The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] 
suffered a setback, but quite clearly remains the most 
substantial group in the democratic opposition; and this 
position requires that it emerge more clearly and more quickly 
from the internal reflections that the voters may have 
interpreted as uncertainty and invisibility. 
  As for the center opposition, which also lost some ground, 
it 
should be noted that it was not overwhelmed, as some predicted, 
by the irresistible siren's call of Berlusconi: It is still a 
force to be reckoned with, though it must quickly answer the 
question of which side it stands on. 
  The Italian vote (whose result will have to be combined with 
that in the local elections) lies within the context of an 
overall European tendency in which there are conflicting results 
from country to country. Against the background of a moderate 
and right-wing offensive, we see various kinds of response (from 
the Labor victory to Kohl's recovery) that nevertheless grant 
the socialist forces a leading role that will influence the 
prospects for European integration. Italy is sending to the 
European Parliament a delegation that will curb, if it is 
actually not hostile to, the cause of political union, and it is 
on this front too that the future political and social struggle 
in our country will take place.

<F P=106> [Guest commentary by Economic Minister Marianne Jelved </F>
(Radical Liberal): "Jelved Predicts 60,000 Fewer People Out of 
Work in a Year and a Half"] 
  [Text] The government's estimate is supported by both 
domestic and foreign economic analysts -- and that may be the 
reason for Anders Fogh Rasmussen's frustration. His use of such 
strident terms as "statistical chicanery" and "touched-up 
figures" speaks for itself. He and the Liberal Party ought to 
look ahead. 
  Anders Fogh Rasmussen is desperately trying to talk away the 
economic upturn that is in progress. 
  In an recent article in BERLINGSKE TIDENDE, he gave a fresh 
example of his numerical exercises with the aim of showing that 
the forthcoming drop in unemployment is not "real." 
  At the same time he makes a big thing out of the fact that 
the latest unemployment figures, for February, show an increase 
compared with January. 
  It is evident from, among other things, the comments from 
the 
Danish Bureau of Statistics on the February unemployment figures 
that the increase is presumably due to transition problems with 
the labor market reform. The other current indicators of 
economic development confirm that an upturn is in progress. Thus 
the newly released national economic figures for the fourth 
quarter of 1993 show a big growth in production, and employment 
in the private sector (seasonally adjusted) has started to rise. 
Therefore there is absolutely no reason to believe that the 
government's current estimate of an unemployment decline of 
20,000 in 1994 and another 25,000 in 1995 will not prove valid. 
This would mean that over 60,000 fewer people will be unemployed 
at the end of 1995 compared with today. 
  The government's estimate is also increasingly supported by 
other economic analysts, both at home and abroad. But that may 
really be the most important reason for Rasmussen's frustration. 
  In addition Rasmussen airs his well-known views on 
"statistical chicanery" and "touched-up figures." 
  The strident language speaks for itself. It is difficult in 
a 
short article to take a stand on the numerical acrobatics. I 
will not weary the reader with this. And all the figures behind 
the government's estimate have been laid out fully and openly in 
the "Economic Digest." But I would like to make two comments. 
  The first is that Rasmussen has suddenly started to include 
1993 in his calculations. 
  It is unfair to use the large drop in employment and the 
sharp rise in unemployment last year as a yardstick for 
evaluating the government's policy. The most important measures 
-- the tax and labor market reform and increased public 
investments -- did not have an impact until the beginning of 
this year. 
  Instead of concentrating on the past, Rasmussen should look 
ahead -- that is the Liberal Party slogan, after all -- and 
comment on the estimate for 1995 when the effects of the 
government's economic policy achieve their full impact in the 
form of a continued drop in unemployment, a sharp rise in 
employment in the private sector, and a substantial improvement 
of public budgets. 
  My second comment is that Rasmussen has made a factual 
error. 
He alleges that the government's current employment estimate 
includes people who are on leave from work under the new system. 
  As I have explained in answering a long list of questions 
from the Folketing Political-Economic Affairs Committee, this is 
just not correct. Rasmussen should have known this from his 
frequent use of the "Economic Digest." 
  In general Rasmussen's insinuating tone is ill placed. Of 
course the Economic Ministry uses internationally approved 
methods when it adds up employment and unemployment. And the 
methods are the same as those used by previous governments. 
  Rasmussen must feel hard-pressed when he resorts to this 
kind 
of "argument."

  [Text] Helsinki, June 20 (AFP) -- Finnish Aid Minister 
Toimi Kankaanniemi submitted his resignation Monday [20 June] to 
President Martti Ahtisaari after differences of opinion over 
Finland's European Union [EU] membership. 
  Prime Minister Esko Aho earlier Monday denied Kankaanniemi 
the right to vote against the government during a ballot to name 
representatives to sign the country's EU membership agreement 
this weekend in Corfu. 
  Kankaanniemi was the Christian Party's only representative 
in 
the government. It is not yet known whether the party will now 
leave the government or whether a new minister will be named.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Esko Aho has appealed to the 
Center Party congress for a positive European Union [EU] 
membership decision. Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, the 
former chairman of the MTK [Central Union of Agricultural 
Producers] also leaned toward EU membership in his speech. 
[passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto and Prime Minister Esko Aho 
have dispelled the Center Party members' concern about security 
policy. According to Haavisto, Finland must be able to be there 
and influence the intergovernmental congress of the EU in 1996. 
According to Prime Minister Aho, there is justification for a 
national referendum if there are any considerable foreign and 
security policy changes concerning Finland. 
  [Begin Aho recording] NATO membership is not in any way 
directly connected to Finland's membership in the EU. My 
starting point is that if the EU makes decisions that 
fundamentally change the bases according to which accession is 
now taking place, then of course, just like in other countries, 
that must be separately ratified nationally. Surely, if 
fundamental changes are made to the bases of our security 
policy, then we will come to a situation where the use of a 
national referendum is justified. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Heated Debate Over Helsinki's </F>
Representatives at European Summit Meetings: Goal of EU 
Membership Triggers Debate Over the Constitution -- Those 
Favoring Membership Still Ahead"] 
  [Text] Helsinki, 23 May -- Prior to its planned entry into 
the European Union [EU], Finland is experiencing intense debate 
over the future distribution of power between the president and 
the government within the new framework. At issue specifically 
is whether Finland should be represented by its head of state or 
by its prime minister as the top official at EU summit meetings. 
  According to the wording of the Constitution the president, 
since March of this year Martti Ahtisaari, has the right and the 
authority to represent Finland in foreign policy matters. This 
authority was utilized to the fullest extent by Urho Kekkonen, 
head of state from 1956 to 1981, particularly in the area of 
ostpolitik. In contrast his successor, Mauno Koivisto, left such 
policy matters up to the government. 
  A committee of experts has determined that both of these 
models are provided for in the wording of the Constitution. The 
transfer of decisionmaking powers to the government and the 
parliament during Koivisto's term of office could take place 
without requiring changes in the articles of the Constitution 
because these articles are quite broadly formulated, thus 
permitting some leeway. 
<H5>  Prime Minister or President </H5>
  Of course this determination does not answer the question of 
whether Finland should conduct itself in keeping with the French 
model (President Mitterrand actively participates in the summit 
meetings) or in keeping with the model of the other member 
states, whose prime ministers lead the delegations. 
  The committee of experts defines this situation as a legal 
stalemate, of which the only thing that can definitely be said 
is that it is "complicated": "Neither the president nor the 
prime minister has the authority set forth in the Constitution 
to commit Finland to specific EU decisions since the realm of 
foreign policy belongs to the president, while domestic policy 
guidelines are established by the prime minister -- and the 
issues discussed at EU summit meetings typically contain both 
foreign policy and domestic policy components." 
  Because it would run contrary to the interpretation of the 
Constitution of the eighties and nineties to invest the head of 
state with additional domestic policy authority, the committee 
feels it would be best to charge the prime minister, currently 
Esko Aho (Center), with the job of representing Finland at EU 
summit meetings. The prerequisite would be that the president 
would transfer at least part of his foreign policy authority to 
the head of government and to individual ministers, as is 
already widely the case based on Koivisto's practice. 
  Of course, the opinion of the experts would not exclude the 
president from appearing in specific cases in the summit round, 
for example in debate over issues that are of central importance 
to Finland's foreign and security policy. With the 
recommendation that the decision should be made on a 
"case-by-case basis," the experts have lobbed the problem ball 
back into the court of the politicians. 
  As a "golden bridge" they suggest that the president should 
regularly participate in the meetings of the governmental 
committee on foreign affairs; it would then become a suitable 
platform for the transfer of power to the government. To 
emphasize parliament's role, it should receive a constant flow 
of information regarding developments in the EU, both directly 
and via its committees. 
  Ahtisaari has spoken out in favor of an expanded process in 
which regular and confidential meetings would take place between 
the president and the party chairmen, during which foreign 
policy guidelines could be agreed upon. As Ahtisaari notes, this 
model has proven successful in Sweden. The committee does not 
like it, however. The proposed body could too easily begin to 
compete with the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
thereby working against the desired strengthening of the 
parliament in the political process. 
<H5>  The Date for the Referendum Has Not Been Set </H5>
  In principle, Ahtisaari has let it be known that he plans to 
follow the Koivisto line of noninterference in the affairs of 
the government, including foreign policy. Still, as a former 
diplomat he has a taste for international involvement, as he 
demonstrated most recently during an official visit to Russia, 
when he assured Boris Yeltsin that Finnish membership in the EU 
would serve to strengthen rather than weaken economic relations 
between the two countries. 
  At the same time Ahtisaari recommended that Moscow initiate 
a 
complete withdrawal of Russian military units from Estonia, as 
this would exert a "stabilizing influence" on the Baltic region. 
Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev reacted promptly with 
the remark that there was "no need" for a Finnish mediator in 
the discussions with Estonia, which, in fact, Ahtisaari had not 
proposed. Nevertheless the Finnish president maintains that his 
country will assume a cautiously active role on this issue. 
  Whether or not Finland will become a member of the EU, as 
Ahtisaari recommends, will be decided in a referendum, to be 
held on a date in the fall that has not yet been set. Although 
the referendum is not directly binding, the parliament may 
orient itself based upon the results. A yes to membership is 
probable in the referendum, but not certain. According to the 
results of the most recent poll, conducted on behalf of the 
industrial associations, 40 percent are in favor of EU 
membership, 37 percent are opposed, and the remainder are 
undecided. In a similar poll taken in the fall of last year, 
those opposed to membership were in the majority with 41 
percent, while 39 percent were in favor of membership.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Finns Believe in Economic Upswing; </F>
Half for EU Membership"] 
  [Text] The Finns have become convinced that the upswing in 
the economy has gotten under way. Today it is only 53 percent 
who think that the country's economic situation reduces 
security, while just six months ago this figure was 78 percent. 
  Concerning a Finnish membership in the European Union [EU], 
currently 48 percent of Finns are in favor, compared with 41 
percent six months year ago. 
  These results appear in an opinion poll that the Finnish 
Gallup organization has conducted for the Planning Commission 
for Defense Information. To find out views of Finns regarding 
security policy issues, Gallup conducted personal interviews 
with around 1,000 individuals during April and May. 
  Unemployment was considered by 50 percent to be a factor 
diminishing national security, compared with 80 percent with 
this view six months ago. Thirty percent of Finns would raise 
defense expenditures, whereas six months ago, 27 percent would 
have liked to see them raised, and a year ago 14 percent. Half 
of those interviewed would like to maintain defense 
appropriations at the present level, and 17 percent would reduce 
them. A half year ago the figures were 51 and 19 percent, 
respectively. 
  The attitude toward defense spending is now the same as it 
was before the Great Depression. 
  Men continued to be more amenable to raising defense 
expenditures than women. Thirty-four percent of men favored 
raised appropriations, contrasted with 25 percent for women. 
  The opinion barometer also indicated that the proportion of 
EU proponents has also increased. Currently, 48 percent of 
voters are positive toward it, compared with 41 percent six 
months ago. Thirty-one percent oppose membership today, while 36 
percent opposed this six months ago. Twenty percent were 
undecided, compared with 22 percent in the previous poll. 
  The figure regarding the national security situation has not 
changed. Over half of Finns, or 57 percent, see the future as 
uncertain over the next five years. Six months earlier, this 
figure was 55 percent. A fifth of those surveyed do not think 
the situation is going to change, and another fifth think the 
future will be more secure than formerly. 
  When those interviewed were given clear alternatives to 
factors or phenomena affecting national security, 87 percent 
replied that nuclear power facilities in Russia is the thing 
that is most responsible for reducing security in Finland.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "SDP Already Up to 35 Percent"] </F>
  [Text] The Social Democratic Party (SDP) still has a strong 
wind in its sails in the opinion polls. According to the most 
recent survey, the party is now up to 35 percent in voter 
support. Since April the SDP's share of voter support has 
increased by 2 percentage points. In the 1991 parliamentary 
elections the SDP received 22.1 percent of votes. 
  For the Center and Conservative Parties [in the ruling 
coalition], it is continued decline. The polling organization 
Taloustutkimus Oy now measures support for the Center Party at 
17 percent, compared with 24.8 percent in the parliamentary 
election. The Conservative Party is just under 17 percent. In 
the parliamentary election that party received 19.3 percent.

<F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "The Communist Party </F>
Reemerging in Fall"] 
  [Text] The Finnish Communist Party (Unity) (SKP-Y) is 
holding a congress in November where the purpose will be to 
resume the activity of the [former] Communist Party of Finland 
[SKP]. When in April the SKP-Y and the Left Alliance (VL) agreed 
to cooperate, it was asserted that the SKP's activity was being 
resumed. At the same time, agreement was reached that the VL 
would also place communists on its election lists in the next 
parliamentary election, states SKP-Y Chairman Yrjo Hakanen. 
According to Hakanen, communists will run in all election 
districts. Among the communist candidates, some will be members 
of the VL, some of the SKP-Y, and some unbound. 
  The convention will be held in Helsinki on 26 and 27 
November. Summoned to the convention are "all party units and 
district organizations within the SKP," in a statement released 
by the SKP-Y. 
  Some of the former minority [hard-line or Stalinist] 
communists are active within the SKP-Y. The SKP itself has been 
dissolved as an organization.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Owe Wiktorin, incoming commander </F>
in chief of the Armed Forces, by Margaretha Bergman in Ronneby; 
date not given: "New Commander in Chief Is Proud of JAS"] 
  [Text] Sweden's inability to put an end to the submarine 
violations is a defeat of its security policy. It is in the 
interest of all the people in Sweden that the violations stop. 
  That is the opinion of Owe Wiktorin, who succeeds Bengt 
Gustafsson as commander in chief of the Armed Forces on 1 July. 
Wiktorin finds it hard to explain why the foreign submarine 
activities continue. 
  "In the new world vision, it is difficult for me to see any 
reason for the violations," he said. 
  Owe Wiktorin thinks it is inappropriate to say, the way the 
intelligence service does, that there is no threatening picture. 
The former Soviet Union's military capability is in a sorry 
state, but the equipment is there, ready to be used: "Russia is 
a factor for insecurity." 
  This uncertain vision of the future is exactly why Sweden, 
according to the new commander in chief, needs a strong defense: 
"The Armed Forces are an insurance premium we pay for the 
future. In 1989 everybody counted on 1,000 years of peace, but 
we in the military were realistic." 
  He thinks the decision to buy 120 new tanks was quite 
correct. He is not equally sure that the Armed Forces can afford 
to buy the attack helicopters intended as complementary to the 
tanks. The solution may be to use SK-60 light attack planes to 
complement the tanks. 
  Sweden's new commander in chief is a warm supporter of the 
JAS [39 Gripen -- multirole combat aircraft] project. He 
regrets the crashes, but adds that these are not unusual in the 
testing of new planes: "We focus on masochism instead of being 
proud of our ability to produce our own airplane. We can be 
proud of getting a plane that is fully adapted to Swedish 
conditions. The JAS is a good plane at a low cost," Wiktorin 
added. 
  He refuses to make predictions about the Armed Forces' 
future 
makeup. The 16 brigades and 16 airborne divisions are not 
definite figures for eternity: Owe Wiktorin is not deaf to the 
idea of further cuts in the number of brigades and divisions.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, who returned 
last night from his visits to United States and London, 
expressed hope that a new approach and process on the Cyprus 
issue would soon begin. He said: The process should begin from 
the UN secretary general's latest report and, after seeking 
various options, aim at creating political will on the Turkish 
side. Mr. Mikhailidhis added: The Greek Cypriot side is 
interested in knowing the other side's position on the 
confidence-building measures [CBM's] so that the new process may 
offer us the possibility to deal with more vital questions. 
Such questions, he explained, are all those that affect 
Turkey's lack of political will, such as the presence of 
occupation troops in Cyprus, questions of security, guarantees 
of a possible solution, questions of settlers, and a series of 
other questions. 
  Mr. Mikhailidhis said that he reiterated to his 
interlocutors 
the Cyprus Government's positions on the various aspects of the 
Cyprus issue and expressed his satisfaction of the UN secretary 
general's crystal clear stand on the 21 March document. Mr. 
Mikhailidhis added that he will brief President Glavkos 
Kliridhis today on the substance of his meetings in the United 
States and London. He noted that he will also brief President 
Kliridhis on the information he exchanged with Greek Deputy 
Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou with whom he travelled from 
London. Mr. Papandreou and Mr. Theodhoros Pangalos concluded 
their contacts in London on behalf of the European Union's [EU] 
Greek presidency within the framework of preparations for the EU 
summit in Corfu. 
  Referring to criticism on some of his visits, Mr. 
Mikhailidhis expressed his regret because, he said, some people 
should be a little patient until they are briefed on what 
actually happened. He also hoped that all the political parties 
would like to hear the views of the permanent and nonpermanent 
Security Council members, which will determine further 
developments.

  [Text] The Cyprus Government has called on the permanent 
members of the UN Security Council to cooperate with the UN 
secretary general's special representative in Cyprus to start 
deliberations with the two sides for a new beginning with the 
addition of new options. 
  The Cyprus Government's call is included in a series of 
points submitted by Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis to the 
UN secretary general and the UN Security Council members. Those 
points were made public just a short while ago. 
  The following are noted as new options: Disarmament; the 
guarantee of a future solution; and reassurance that the 
Security Council can never accept negotiations for a solution 
unless they are based on only one sovereignty, nationality, and 
international identity. Other options noted include demographic 
changes and a population census, the issue of Turkish troops in 
Cyprus, and the call for Turkey to conform with Security Council 
Resolution 550 and hand over the fenced area of Famagusta to the 
United Nations. 
  In the points submitted, Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis also 
notes that if the Security Council avoids proceeding in a 
decisive manner to achieve a new beginning, then the message to 
the Greek Cypriot side would be that it is avoiding putting the 
blame where it should, failing to assume alternative measures, 
not showing determination, and refraining from blaming Turkey. 
The message to [Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas is that it 
is not necessary to abandon his usual tactics and lack of 
political will, since in the end they will save him and his 
unacceptable stance will be tolerated. 
  In the points that Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis submitted, 
he repeats that the Cyprus Government still accepts the 21 March 
document and stresses that it has no objections to any efforts 
by anyone to convince the Turkish side to accept the 
confidence-building measures and ways to implement them. 
Finally, the foreign minister notes that the Greek Cypriot side 
believes that if the UN secretary general should give any 
additional information to the Security Council, it should be 
done in a verbal briefing and not in a supplementary report. 
Furthermore, the foreign minister notes that if someone 
believes that the confidence-building measures have a future, he 
should pressure the Turkish side to accept them, and there 
should be no effort to hold further talks on them.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis stressed that the 
prerequisite for any progress on the Cyprus issue is for the 
Security Council to be convinced that alternate ways should be 
adopted that would compel the Turkish side to show political 
will for a solution. 
  In an address at a gathering to commemorate the fallen EOKA 
[National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] fighters from 
Paphos, which was organized today by the town's fighter 
associations, President Kliridhis recalled that because of the 
lack of political will, which has also been noted by the United 
Nations, the National Council decided unanimously that the 
discussion of the confidence-building measures [CBM's] has been 
terminated and that we should proceed with discussions on the 
substance of the Cyprus issue after the necessary measures have 
been taken to break the Turkish intransigence. President 
Kliridhis also reiterated that he is prepared to sign an 
agreement on the CBM's provided the Turkish side accepts the 21 
March document. 
  The president added that the Greek Cypriots are united in 
the 
most crucial phase of our national problem and expressed the 
conviction that they will remain united in addressing it 
successfully. 
  Arriving at the ceremony, President Kliridhis said that he 
expects consultations on the Cyprus issue to continue in view of 
the Butrus-Ghali discussion. Responding to a question, he said 
that he has not yet received replies to his letters sent to the 
U.S. President and the British prime minister. Responding to 
another question, President Kliridhis said that he is not 
pessimistic.

  [Text] DISI [Democratic Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis 
said in London today that he carries a message from President 
Glavkos Kliridhis for German Chancellor Helmut Kohl related to 
Cyprus' application for accession to the EU [European Union]. 
The message will be conveyed to Chancellor Kohl during the 
European Popular Party meeting, which will take place tomorrow 
in Brussels and will be attended by leaders of European 
Christian Democratic parties. The meeting will deal with issues 
that will be raised during the EU Summit in Corfu on Friday [24 
June]. 
  Matsis, who went to London to attend a meeting of DISI's 
chapter in Britain, also said that Cyprus' effort for EU 
accession is the best possibility to promote the Cyprus issue in 
order to safeguard the safety of both communities and their 
human rights.

  The defense minister left at noon today for France where, at 
the invitation of the French Government, he will visit a weapons 
systems exhibition. He will also meet with Francois Leotard, 
the French minister of state for defense, and representatives of 
companies that manufacture weapons systems to discuss questions 
of technical support to the National Guard. Responding to a 
question asked before his departure, Iliadhis said that the 
Defense Ministry police force will have direct contacts with the

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today 
commented on the decision of the Turkish Constitutional Court 
outlawing Turkey's Democratic Party. International public 
opinion, he said, which can recognize justice, will judge this 
move. 
  The KKE [Greek Communist Party] described the Turkish 
court's 
decision to dissolve the Democratic Party and remove 13 deputies 
from office as illegal and an escalation of the persecution of 
the Kurdish people. 
  The Coalition of the Left and Progress protested the Turkish 
move as a brutal violation of basic democratic freedoms. It 
also stressed that geopolitical expediencies lead the powerful 
countries to take hypocritical stances.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said 
that Turkey must stop causing artificial tension. At the same 
time Ankara was criticized by European Union [EU] Commissioner 
Hans van den Broek. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Nikos Meletis] Government 
Spokesman Venizelos today said that the possibility of a 
Greek-Turkish summit meeting has not been raised. The spokesman 
characteristically stressed there will not be another meeting 
like that in Davos, Switzerland. 
  [Venizelos] Theoretically we have never ruled out such a 
possibility, but there are no plans and no specific proposal or 
desire for something like that. What is important is that the 
cycle of artificial tension must stop. 
  [Meletis] Venizelos repeated that the only outstanding 
difference between Greece and Turkey is over the drawing of the 
boundaries on the continental shelf. All other so-called 
differences are unilateral Turkish demands and cannot be part of 
a dialogue. 
  At the same time, in Ankara they are thinking seriously 
following yesterday's criticism by EU Commissioner Van den 
Broek, who made it clear that the deterioration in respect for 
human rights and the lack of progress in the Cyprus issue 
constitute serious obstacles in EU-Turkey relations. These 
statements were made just one day after the Constitutional 
Court's decision to dissolve the pro-Kurdish Democratic Party, a 
decision which has drawn a lot of reaction. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that 
following yesterday's double demarches on U.S. State Department 
Spokesman Michael McCurry's statement, the Greek Government 
would receive with satisfaction any clarification from the U.S. 
side. He added that McCurry's position, on setting the airspace 
and territorial waters at six miles, basically concerns NATO's 
maneuvers and is related to the more general, international U.S. 
positions.

<F P=106> [Report by Kira Adham] </F>
  [Excerpts] Diplomatic and military circles consider the 
written statement from the U.S. State Department in which the 
government challenges the 10-mile limit of Greek airspace as a 
clear sign of the U.S. desire for a summit meeting between 
Greece and Turkey as soon as possible. 
  Inevitably, this issue will be at the center of the talks 
that National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis will have next 
week in Washington with his U.S. counterpart, William Perry, 
following a last-minute upgrade of the visit by the United 
States. He will also meet with State Department officials, U.S. 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, and National Security 
Adviser Anthony Lake. 
  It is certain that besides the issues of Aegean and 
Greek-Albanian relations, the agenda will include the situation 
in the Balkans. 
  According to initial estimates by government circles, with 
the State Department statement on the 10-mile airspace the U.S. 
Government chose to "attack" the substance of the problems in 
the Aegean, which include the Turkish challenge of Greek 
airspace since 1974 with systematic infringements and violations 
by Turkish fighter planes. 
  The point that for the Greek side is not yet "clear" is 
whether the recent U.S. move is an initiative by that country 
itself following the refusal of Greek Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias to discuss U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's proposal for disarmament of Greek planes in the 
Aegean or whether it is a "promotion" of Turkish positions by 
the U.S. side. 
  Even though the Greek Government's reaction to the American 
and Turkish sides yesterday was made in low tones, it insisted 
on Greece's firm position to defend its sovereign rights in the 
Aegean. [passage omitted] 
  The Greek Foreign Ministry reacted through diplomatic 
channels with representations from the Greek ambassador in 
Washington to the State Department and from Ambassador Khristos 
Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry director general, who called U.S. 
Ambassador in Athens Thomas Niles into his office. 
  According to information from diplomatic circles, the Greek 
Government wants to make it clear to the American side that it 
has no intention of causing an incident with Turkey in the 
Aegean. On the contrary, it intends to reestablish a low-level 
bilateral dialogue with Ankara, as it was agreed in principle 
during the recent meeting between the foreign ministers of the 
two countries, Papoulias and Hikmet Cetin, on issues that 
concern both countries but that do not challenge sovereign 
rights, such as Greek airspace. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Former conservative Prime Minister Konstandinos 
Mitsotakis has been ordered to stand trial for moral instigation 
and violation of his oath of office stemming from alleged 
involvement in illegal wiretaps on political foes from 1988 to 
1991. Parliament capped an eight-hour debate yesterday by 
voting 163 to 6, with six deputies casting blank ballots, to try 
Mr Mitsotakis before a special 13-member court. 
  "If you can legally and morally support (this action) and 
believe it will benefit you politically, then continue this 
political persecution," the former premier told the 300-seat 
chamber. "What you decide leaves me cold and indifferent." 
  He added that the charges were part of a political vendetta 
against him by his political nemesis, Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou, and warned that the decision to place him on trial 
would backfire against the socialists. 
  Immediately following Mr Mitsotakis' speech, the 111 
conservative New Democracy deputies walked out of the session 
and did not vote.

  [Text] The Greek Foreign Ministry described a Macedonian 
News Agency [based in Thessaloniki] dispatch from Washington 
that says the ministry promotes the idea of a more loose 
interception of Turkish planes that violate Greek airspace and 
that at a certain time missiles will be taken off our planes as 
totally untrue. 
  The Foreign Ministry also noted: As it has been very clearly 
stressed in the government's policy statement and as Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias has repeatedly stressed, Greece's 
firm and unmoved position is the defense of our national 
sovereignty and the complete exercise of the right of defense 
with all necessary means.

  [Text] High-tech security electronic equipment, which will 
be used for the first time in our country, will be installed in 
Corfu for the EU [European Union] summit. This was agreed on by 
Public Order Minister Stilianos Papathemelis and his Israeli 
counterpart, Moshe Shahal, during the Greek minister's visit to 
Jerusalem. Correspondent's Kostas Tomaras has the following 
report. 
  [Begin Tomaras recording] The beginning of a close 
cooperation between Greek and Israeli authorities, especially on 
the issue of combating terrorism, was marked by the visit of 
Public Order Minister Papathemelis to Israel at the beginning of 
this week. During a news conference held today, Papathemelis 
announced that this cooperation will begin at the EU Summit in 
Corfu, where a team of Israeli specialists will install special 
equipment as part of the security measures. The equipment will 
include cameras that take pictures at night and from a great 
distance. The team of Israelis will arrive in our country next 
week and will train Greek officials in the use of that 
equipment, which afterwards will remain with the Greek police. 
The public order minister said he was impressed with the modern 
technical means that the Israelis have and which he did not even 
see in the United States. The public order minister also let be 
known that the Israelis have information on terrorism, mainly 
due to the perfect organization of their police, and hopes that 
the signing of a bilateral cooperation agreement will result in 
the transfer of that information to the Greek authorities. The 
cooperation among the authorities of the two countries will be 
extended to combating drugs and illegal immigration and the 
exchange of information, mainly the supply of high technology 
equipment necessary for the modernization of the Greek police. 
Asked whether he discussed the issue noted in a recent report 
by Italian newspaper CORRIERE DELLA SERA regarding the gathering 
of terrorists in Iran, Papathemelis replied: I raised the issue 
with persistence but the Israelis were not willing to tell me. 
In another question on whether the Israelis have any 
information about terrorism in Greece, the public order minister 
said that only time will tell. However, he stressed that the 
Israeli authorities have the capability to get such information 
from sources to which we have no access. Finally, on his visit 
to Israeli, the public order minister said that it was 
considered a step that supports the peace efforts in the area 
and that Israel looks forward to the role of Greece and Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou in that peace. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "Side Fires"] </F>
  [Text] Greece is under fire on all national issues, 
including the Aegean, the Macedonian issue, the Cyprus issue, 
and the rights of the Greek minority in Albania. The fire comes 
from the United States and from the EU [European Union], it is 
combined and coordinated. The target is obvious. 
  In the Aegean, friends and allies want full restoration of 
Greek-Turkish relations. They are indifferent to Greek rights. 
They want the friction stopped; this is what interests them. 
With their actions, they are encouraging Turkey to provoke a 
crisis in the Aegean in order to force a meeting between Greek 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Turkish Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller under conditions that will be negative for Greece. 
  This is the reason why suddenly the United States raised, 
particularly with its written statement, the issue of air space 
by challenging Greece's 10 mile limit. For many years now the 
United States has not gotten involved, at least publicly, in 
this Greek-Turkish dispute. It also asked for the disarmament 
of our planes. Furthermore, the WEU [Western European Union] 
upgrades Turkey's position despite the just objections of Greece. 
  Concerning the Macedonian issue, we are pressured by the 
United States and Europe to make the first step toward solution 
of the issue. In addition, the French National Assembly refuses 
to ratify Greece's accession to the WEU as long as the Greek 
embargo against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] is still pending. 
  On the Cyprus issue, U.S. President Bill Clinton and British 
Prime Minister John Major are exerting pressure on UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to change his report in order to 
satisfy the Turkish Cypriot side. As for the Greek minority in 
Albania, the United States maintains its doubts that the 
minority is persecuted and that minority rights are violated. 
  The outline of these actions by friends and allies are 
convincing that Greece is under pressure. The pressure is 
suffocating. There are dangers and the immediate one is in the 
Aegean. A Greek-Turkish crisis would also affect the 
developments of other national issues. That is why Greece should 
be careful with its moves and reactions. It should not fall into 
the trap of provocations. 
  The Greek Government avoids Turkish provocations, and this 
is 
correct. This is not a time for pseudo-bullying and hectoring. 
Greece is also refraining from deteriorating its relations with 
its friends and allies, and this is right. But it should be 
careful. Deterioration of relations is one thing, but it is 
another to remain firm in its demand to place these relations 
based on justice and respect of the country's national rights. 
  It is necessary for the government to activate and guide its 
foreign policy carefully and firmly. It should seek and secure 
the agreement of the opposition as well. The danger is in the 
Aegean. With daring moves, it should constructively close 
national issues with Skopje and Albania. This move will also 
weaken Ankara's provocations and its support in the United 
States and Europe.

interest to several regional problems. "We will evaluate these 
problems," he added. 
  Van den Broek said the main reason of his visit is to show

  [Text] Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated 
that Turkey welcomes the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' 
constructive contribution to keeping the process involving the 
confidence-building measures [CBM] package alive. Cetin met 
with European Union [EU] Commission member Hans van den Broek 
and later held a news conference in which he said that he had 
briefed van den Broek on the CBM package. 
  Van den Broek, in turn, stated that he had discussed the 
Cyprus issue with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and with Cetin. 
Noting that the Cyprus issue is not new, van den Broek added 
that the failure to reach a solution on the issue is having an 
adverse affect on relations between the Turkish and Greek 
Cypriots. Explaining that the EU is not proposing any solutions 
or imposing itself on Turkey regarding a Cyprus solution, van 
den Broek noted that the EU is merely following up the proposals 
made by the UN secretary general. 
  Recalling that the Greek Cypriot Administration had applied 
for full membership in the EU, van den Broek said that the Greek 
Cypriots had been told that unless a political solution to the 
Cyprus issue was found, their sitting at the table with the EU 
was out of the question. Van den Broek added that since years 
went by with no steps being taken toward a political solution, 
the EU could no longer defend the same position and was 
therefore forced to consider the Greek Cypriot side's request 
for full membership.

relations with the EU. Van den Broek, in turn, stated that the

<F P=106> [Reports by Kamran Qurrah Daghi in London and AL-HAYAH </F>
bureau in Ankara: "Ankara Opposes Kurdish Elections and Urges 
Kurds To Have a Dialogue With Baghdad"] 
  [Excerpts] Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat 
Ataman announced yesterday that Ankara told the Kurdish leaders 
at a meeting held last week that it is opposed to new elections 
in northern Iraq and stressed the need for dialogue with Baghdad. 
  Kurdish sources well-informed on the Silopi meeting, 
however, 
have stressed to AL-HAYAH that the question of elections was not 
even discussed by the Turkish delegation and Kurdish leaders 
Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani. They added that the Kurdish 
leadership itself has not yet decided whether or not to hold 
early parliamentary elections. The current parliamentary term 
ends on 1 May next year. [passage omitted] 
  The same Kurdish sources also told AL-HAYAH that the Turkish 
delegation did not ask the Kurdish leaders to hold a dialogue 
with Baghdad but rather "expressed its viewpoint" on that 
matter. The Turkish side was of the opinion that the Kurds 
"might be able to get more gains from Baghdad because of its 
regime's weakness and isolation, and that, in this connection, 
they should take advantage of the fact that they enjoy the 
protection of the Western coalition and Turkey." 
  The sources also said that the Kurdish leaders affirmed that 
"they did not at all reject the principle of dialogue but were 
not willing to accept a solution at any price." They emphasized 
that Baghdad is refusing to implement UN resolutions including 
Resolution 688. The Kurdish leaders also reaffirmed that "the 
Kurds are committed to consultation with all the allies who 
provide protection for them, including the Turks." [passage

  [Text] Ankara, June 19 (A.A.) -- President Suleyman 
Demirel sent a letter to his Iranian counterpart 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Greek counterpart Konstandinos Karamanlis 
on prevention of the separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] organization's activities in their countries, it was 
reported on Sunday [19 June]. 
  Presidential Press Center, in a written statement, said 
Demirel sent a letter to Rafsanjani on May 31 and expressed 
pleasure on Turkish-Iranian cooperation against terrorism. 
  Demirel said joint struggle on the issue is for the benefit 
of the two countries `we call for Iran to take necessary 
measures against the PKK terrorists who were reported to be 
existing in Iran.' 
  The Press Center said Rafsanjani replied the letter by 
sending a message with Iranian Interior Minister 'Ali Mohammad 
Besharati. 
  The message said Turkish-Iranian cooperation on security is 
contributing to the two country relations adding that Iran is 
determined to take measures against PKK. 
  The statement also said Demirel had sent a letter to 
Karamanlis on June 2 saying that necessary measures should be 
taken against the separatist terrorist organization. 
  Demirel said France and Germany banned the organization's 
activities and the other countries are closely following the 
activities `however' he added `we learned that PKK has opened a 
bureau in Athens under another name and terrorists caught in 
Turkey said they were trained in camps in Greece.' 
  The statement reported Demirel as saying `Turkish-Greek 
relations would be destroyed if these come true.' 
  Karamanlis in reply said Greece did not allow PKK's 
terrorist 
activities on its territory adding that it seriously condemned 
terrorism to continue good neighboring [as received] relations. 
  The Foreign Ministry earlier summoned the Greek ambassador 
and asked for information from Athens on confessions made by a 
number of PKK members. 
  The terrorists, during their interrogation said that they 
received training in Greece. 
  Athens had denied the statements of terrorists.

  [Text] Ankara -- While clashes continue between the Turkish 
security forces and the clandestine Workers Party of Kurdistan 
(PKK) militants in southeastern Turkey, the militants announced 
a series of new command strategies. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan 
reportedly ordered the PKK's so-called regional "states" to be 
divided up into "field commands." 
  Previously, the PKK's command structure was based on a 
system 
of regional states. These were Botan, Amed, Mardin, Garzan, 
Serhat, Dersim, Devrimci GAP, Behdinan, and the southeastern 
states. Now, as a result of Ocalan's decision, the states are 
to be divided up into three areas, identified as the north, 
central, and south field commands. 
  According to Ocalan, coordination in the region has to be 
improved since regional development is being hindered. Ocalan 
is quoted as saying: "We have to know how to organize the field 
commands to increase the power of the organization. We feel 
this new system will be very effective and useful." 
  Furthermore, the PKK leader also reportedly ordered an 
increase in the number of attacks on rural areas and cities. 
"We will apply all the rules of militarization, and attacks 
will be conducted by our guerrilla forces," he said. 
  According to the Kurdish-German News Agency "Kurd-A," Ocalan 
said: "We cannot continue to be satisfied with the present 
level of fighting and the number of guerrilla forces. The 
number of guerrillas has to be increased to 50,000, otherwise we 
cannot achieve a strategic result." 
  Referring to the importance of the new strategy, the PKK 
leader added: "The field command posts are necessary in order 
to bring about a full political solution. There are targets 
that will be hit by our guerrillas either by infiltration or 
through assassination." Ocalan commented on the PKK's methods: 
"Secrecy is the weapon of the guerrilla to the end, unlike in 
the story of Don Quixote. We will chop them up and eat them bit 
by bit. The militia will be in action. For example we can 
prepare two militia units which can assassinate and carry out 
sabotage activities." 
  By giving these instructions, the separatist terrorist 
leader 
has given his approval for assassinations to be carried out. 
Sources known to be close to Ocalan say that these 
assassinations will focus on informers and, later, anybody in a 
"target position." 
  The first example of this strategy was seen Sunday with the 
killing of the former Faysal Kut. A former PKK commander of the 
Mardin region, Kut had been accused of stealing 1 billion 
Turkish Lira from the organization. 
  Meanwhile, there have been clashes between government 
security forces and the PKK in the mountains close to the 
district of Saimbeyli in the Adana region. It is reported that 
the PKK is organizing in the region in order to move quickly to 
the Taurus mountains. The process of organization is reportedly 
being carried out by militants of the Turkish Revolutionist 
People's Party (TDHP), founded under the supervision of the PKK.

<F P=106> [Interview with Cemil Bayik, head of the Military Council of </F>
ARGK, People's Liberation Army of Kurdistan, by KURD-A; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [KURD-A] The crisis-ridden Turkish economy was 
paralyzed with the "5 April Measures." Many banks have gone 
bankrupt. Thousands of workers are being laid off. The trade 
union leaders are saying that the workers might work for free to 
save the economy. The need is felt for employers to make 
sacrifices. The government is getting more reaction than 
support at home and abroad. In view of this, based on which 
forces are Ciller and Karayalcin able to remain in power? 
  [Bayik] Everyone agrees that Turkey is in an insurmountable 
crisis, which is not solely economic. One could also speak of 
crisis in the economic, political, social, cultural, military, 
diplomatic, and all other areas that feed each other. In 
addition to surmounting the crisis, the adopted measures have 
further deepened it. Most importantly, though the pro-regime 
parties are continuously stressing that things are going bad, 
they are not proposing any solution. The events starkly show 
that the regime has reached the brink of bankruptcy and it has 
no way to avert it. Each day brings the growing realization 
that the increased cost of war in Kurdistan will further 
aggravate this bankruptcy and will bring an end to the regime. 
The war is the main source of all the problems. The Turkish 
Republic, which insists on waging the war, will not be able to 
extricate itself from the situation it has fallen into. It will 
certainly erode even further with the loss of foreign trust. 
  The reasons for the survival of Ciller-Karayalcin government 
should be sought in this helplessness we try to portray. It is 
a matter of the regime's bankruptcy. A government change would 
have been easier had the problem not been at the dimension 
portrayed. The lack of an alternative makes a change of 
government costly for the regime. This plays a role in the 
survival of the government. Another factor is that this 
government enjoys the army's support. The Ciller government 
meets every demand of the generals, and fulfills each demand 
promptly. It has plainly handed the initiative to the army. 
The army feels the need to be in power at a time when war is 
determining every aspect of life in Kurdistan and Turkey. The 
army is supporting the present government which uncritically 
complies with its demands. 
  An army unsuccessful at war has no tolerance for government 
changes or criticisms. It needs a government that does 
everything it says. The Ciller-Karayalcin government is doing 
just that. The army will not accept the change of a government 
with which it is in full harmony. If, despite this, a 
government change is insisted upon, then the generals might 
intervene. 
  [KURD-A] The Turkish Republic finds itself in a logjam in 
foreign policy. It is unable to exert influence on Southern 
Kurdistan [Iraqi Kurdistan]. It cannot exploit the KDP 
[Democratic Party of Kurdistan] and other forces as it has in 
the past. Its military operations are without result. Its 
attempts to reopen the oil pipeline is facing obstacles. It is 
being forced to make concessions on the Cyprus problem to 
international organizations, primarily by the UN. In view these 
developments, what sort of a connection exists between Turkey's 
increased attacks on Greece and the Cyprus problem? What could 
you say other than those already known to the public? 
  [Bayik] Efforts to solve the Cyprus problem have 
intensified. Pressure on the Turkish Republic to end the Turkish 
occupation has intensified. Now, practical results are needed. 
But, the Turkish Republic insists on being an occupationist and 
is avoiding taking steps. To counterbalance the pressure on it, 
Turkey is trying to drag Greece into artificial tensions because 
the latter is taking the Cyprus problem to the international 
arena and is intensifying its efforts for a solution. The aim 
behind creating tension and fomenting problems between Greece 
and her neighbors Albania and Macedonia, is to rein Greece in on 
the Cyprus problem. With its provocations, Turkey could 
aggravate the problems between Greece and her neighbors Albania 
and Macedonia. It could also organize provocations using the 
"Western Thrace Turks." If these prove insufficient, Turkey may 
aggravate the tension by some de facto moves of its own. 
Turkey's ultimate aim is to bring about the capitulation of 
Greece by encircling it externally and internally. 
  It is likely that Turkey will step-up its pressure on 
Greece. One of the aims is to neutralize Greece on the Cyprus 
problem, and the other is to prevent an alliance between the 
Greek people and the Kurdish people, which has launched a war of 
liberation under the guidance of the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan]. 
  Presently, Greece has won a strong ally against the constant 
threat posed by Turkey in the war-waging Kurdish people. The 
Turkish threat has been weakened as a result of our struggle. 
The alliance of the Kurdish and Greek people is the main factor 
capable of preventing the aforementioned threat. With the 
attacks described above, Turkey wants to prevent the development 
of this alliance. If Turkey succeeds, it will not only deprive 
Greece of a strong ally, but will also neutralize one of the 
Kurds' principal allies, which could take the Kurdish people's 
cause to international platforms and strengthen it with 
multisided support. 
  Turkey's efforts in this direction produced some results in 
the past because of a lack of solidarity and mutual support 
among people facing the Turkish threat. If the same failings 
are not repeated and a strong alliance is forged, this threat 
will vanish never to rise again. The success of the Kurdish 
people fighting under the guidance of our party will bring 
success to the Greek people. The support given by the Greek 
people will bring our people's success closer. 
  [KURD-A] The Turkish Republic is unable to achieve any 
serious results with its military operations. It also could not 
stand up to ARGK guerrillas during its "cross-border 
operations." Despite that, statements are being issued at home 
to the effect that "PKK is on the verge of extinction." The 
Turkish Army and state are calling for the surrender of ARGK 
guerrillas and asking people to help bring about this surrender. 
Why does the Turkish Republic feel the need for this? 
  [Bayik] The Turkish state's endurance is waning in the face 
of problems generated by the war. The filthy war waged by the 
army is constantly eating up Turkey's resources. Even a day's 
war expenses is enough to aggravate the crisis into which the 
regime has fallen. The Turkish Republic has channeled all its 
strength and potential to the service of war. Yet, it is unable 
to obtain any result. Failure would mean disappointment for it. 
  It declared 1994 a successful year. The state and the army 
tried to convince themselves of this. Despite the passage of 
time, no success has come their way. On the contrary, they were 
further weakened. The army's morale has plummeted drastically. 
There was a drop in the intensity of the operations. The blows 
dealt by our guerrillas have plunged the army into 
disintegration. Not only is the army disintegrating, but also 
other state institutions. The guerrilla force, which has taken 
the initiative, will henceforth escalate and amplify its 
attacks. We will henceforth witness rapid disintegrations. 
  Faced with this situation, the state and the army are 
drawing 
up deceptive pictures of success claiming to have attained goals 
which they have not. The psychological aspect of the war is 
given prominence to avert a disintegration, to prevent further 
aggravation of the crisis in which the regime finds itself, to 
weaken our people's participation in the struggle, and to 
prevent international recognition and support for the PKK. At 
first they adopted the strategy of dealing a blow to the 
guerrilla force and bringing about its dissolution. They wanted 
to inflict heavy blows on the guerrilla force and then force it 
to disintegrate. They thought then they could do away with the 
whole problem. These strategies did not succeed. Their attacks 
were repulsed by the guerrillas and their offensive potential 
was broken by counterattacks. For that reason they are now 
partially changing their strategy. They have now chosen to 
bring about disintegration and destruction of the guerrilla 
force by undermining the morale of the guerrillas and the people 
through propaganda. Let us state that their efforts will be in 
vain. Such tested and failed strategies have no chance of 
success. The Turkish Republic is in a situation of completely 
losing the war. No war strategy will save or bring success to 
it. 
  The morale of the ARGK guerrillas is being strengthened with 
new successes won daily. No call could undermine its morale; 
rather, our people and young men will redouble their 
contribution by taking heart in our successes. ARGK's strength 
and initiative is making more decisive clashes possible. I am 
asserting that the course of the war will rapidly run counter to 
the Turkish Republic. 
  [KURD-A] You had once expressed your position on thestance 
of the West and of the United States towards the Kurdish problem 
and their move to occupy South [Iraqi] Kurdistan. Has any 
change occurred in your policies since then? What is the latest 
situation in the South? Why is Turkey mediating? 
  [Bayik] Both the United States and the West are losing hope 
that Turkey could be successful in the war. They are also 
admitting that policies denying the existence of the Kurdish 
problem are impractical. Hence they find it meaningless to 
press ahead with the war based on these policies. Therefore 
they are trying to persuade Turkey to make changes in its 
policy. Where their advice is not heeded, they are launching 
certain initiatives. But all these are being done to ensure 
Turkey's existence. The United States and UK are looking at the 
issue within the framework of the Kurdish problem, whereas the 
Turkish Republic is not even admitting the existence of the 
problem by claiming that "there is no Kurdish problem, but a 
problem of terrorism." This is where contradictions exist 
between them. Again, whereas the United States and the Western 
powers are pressuring Turkey to introduce certain reforms, the 
Turkish Republic insists on a policy of denial and annihilation. 
This is the second point of contradiction. It appears that the 
United States and the Western powers will intensify their 
efforts to make Turkey accept their position. Where persuasion 
fails, they will use warning measures, and if those also fail, 
limited measures might be considered. 
  All this does not mean that these powers have forfeited 
Turkey. It also does not mean recognition of our people's will. 
But, nevertheless they imply a change. The further development 
of our war might speed up this change and bring us to the point 
of a federal solution, and the recognition of our people's will. 
But this will not come easily; there is a need to strengthen 
the struggle and exert intensive effort, and a need for time. 
  There is no serious change in the position of the 
aforementioned powers towards South Kurdistan. The U.S.-UK duo 
are inclined to freeze the problem at the stage it is now in and 
to safeguard the existing situation. They did not take sides in 
the clashes; rather, they did not show much interest in them. 
Their involvement is through the Iraqi National Congress. They 
do not want to be a direct counterpart. We could state that 
compared to the past, their interest in South Kurdistan has 
waned. Barring serious developments, this waning interest could 
go as far as embracing Saddam. Germany and France are after a 
solution that would not eliminate Saddam. They appear to have 
reached an agreement on this issue with the Turkish Republic and 
Iran. They are exerting efforts to revive the KDP-based 
autonomy and Iraq's sovereignty over Kurdistan. Therefore, they 
are trying to subdue the YNK [Patriotic Union of Kurdistan], 
which they regard as an impediment to their plan. This is what 
rests behind the latest clashes. Through talks they want to 
bring about the surrender of the YNK, which they pushed into the 
clashes. If they succeed in this, they will have not only 
neared a solution they envisage for the South but also managed 
to sideline a force which is an ally of the PKK. In this way 
they want to deprive us of the opportunity to make use of the 
South. 
  Any upsurge in clashes between the YNK and the KDP is 
fraught 
with risks. Despite all foreign assistance, the KDP's strength 
is limited. It is questionable if it could gain the upper hand 
in the fighting or take the area under its control. If the 
clashes continue and escalate the possibility of the 
independence line advocated by the PKK making fast advances and 
gains could arise. That is why the Turkish Republic is entering 
the developments and is assuming the role of a mediator in the 
clashes. It considers establishing control over the region by 
limiting the clashes to be to its advantage. This is the 
essence of its mediation efforts. If the talks do not do the 
trick it is always possible to rekindle the low-intensity 
clashes. Yet another reason for its mediation at the talks is 
to charm the domestic and international public and thus to hide 
its role in the clashes. This is truly a demonstration of 
duplicity. 
  [KURD-A] In contrast to other European countries, Germany is 
continuing attacks on your party. It has gone beyond all 
bounds. What are the reasons pushing Germany into such a 
situation? 
  [Bayik] The German state is a full participant in the 
Turkish 
Republic's dirty war against our people. Only, unlike the case 
of General Moltke [Helmuth Karl Bernhard who served in Ottoman 
Army], it has not allowed its generals to take part in Turkey's 
operation to quell the uprising. Perhaps it has, but we are not 
aware of it. However, I can state that we expect it to take such 
a step. 
  Not only is Germany taking sides, it is a partner in the 
war. The German state's stance towards our party and people is 
unacceptable. 
  We are duty bound to defend ourselves not only against the 
Turkish Republic but also against its German accomplice. We 
will make use of this right by using all means at our disposal. 
We cannot cave in to a bully, if we do we will be subjected to 
more bullying. While using our legal self-defense right, we 
would like to see our German friends, the German people, and the 
progressive public on our side. 
  The only way not to become partners with the German state's 
dirty objectives is to oppose its war partnership with the 
Turkish Republic. To oppose it is tantamount to defending 
democracy, human rights, and humanity. 
  It must be understood that the German state will not be the 
winner. Our people's will, reflected by our party, will win 
with the support of progressive mankind, primarily our German 
friends. We believe that both the German people and the 
progressive mankind will mete out the punishment deserved by the 
German officials who in unison with the Turkish Republic 
officials chant: "We will eradicate the PKK;" "The PKK does not 
represent the Kurdish people." 
  [KURD-A] Documents and evidence suggest that many circles 
feel Behcet Canturk [a Kurdish businessman], who was murdered 
last month, and Savas Buldan and his two abducted friends [also 
Kurdish businessmen] were murdered by the state. Mahir Kaynak 
[a former Turkish National Intelligence Organization official] 
claimed that the businessmen were killed by those who submitted 
a list of Kurdish businessmen to Ciller. As always, the 
state-run televisions and radios are trying to establish a link 
between the murder victims and the PKK. As you know just before 
dying Muhsin Melik [a Kurdish party official] said: "The police 
shot me." We want to know your views on this matter. 
  [Bayik] For some time now the Turkish Republic's attacks on 
the guerrillas have assumed the dimension of national 
annihilation. All sections of the society favoring national 
liberation have become targets. It has become a daily business 
to destroy all the national elements. Those siding with the 
national liberation and contributing to the struggle are being 
murdered. Savas Buldan and his friends were murdered as part of 
this policy by the colonialists. The same thing applies to 
Muhsin Melek. We cannot consider these murders and previous 
ones as mystery murders. Those who perpetrated them are not 
unknown. These murders are being committed by the Turkish 
Republic without much bother to hide them; only that it does not 
openly assume responsibility for them to deflect criticism. 
  All the national strata started entering the ranks of the 
struggle over the last few years. This is also true for the 
wealthy and intellectual sections of the society. While all the 
dynamic forces of the nation went into action and started 
contributing to the war of liberation within their means, the 
Turkish Republic launched a variety of attacks in response. 
Those prominent among the national groups (intellectuals, 
businessmen, and so on) who have taken a clear stance on the 
side of the struggle are being murdered one after another. The 
aim is to cut off the contribution of various social strata to 
the struggle. An all-out genocide is being perpetrated against 
our people these days. These massacres do not pale in 
comparison to the past ones. There is no difference in the 
number of people killed now and those killed during massacres in 
the past. Only the method of implementing the genocide is 
different. In the past, our people who were regarded as enemies 
were massacred in a certain place and time and then buried alone 
or in mass graves, or sometimes they were not even buried. 
Today's massacres are not confined to a specific place and 
time. Now the ongoing massacres are spread over all areas and 
time. That is, in the past tens of thousands of our people used 
to be massacred in one specific location within a brief time. 
This change in method is due the fact that our struggle had 
spread over a large area and a longer time span, and the public 
has become more sensitive. The colonialists are afraid of 
domestic and foreign reaction to mass massacres. For that 
reason, they want to attain the same results by massacring 
people one-by-one or in groups. They are trying to hide this as 
much as possible. All these show that the Turkish colonialists 
are developing new methods of genocide. They carry out the 
massacres with more mastery. The mystery murders are a part of 
this mastery. In the case of Behcet Canturk, Savas Buldan and 
his friends, Muhsin, and tens of murders committed daily, the 
murderer is the Turkish Republic. Whether or not the massacres 
are being committed by the state's open or secret forces is not 
important. What is important is that one should not be caught 
unaware at a time when the enemy has intensified its genocidal 
activity. Measures against it would be even closer ties with 
and more effective participation in the struggle. Our reply 
will be to escalate the war. 
  [KURD-A] Political circles are indicating that the Turkish 
Republic will step up violence until the autumn and then 
introduce Kurdish television, education, and similar things. Is 
this possible? By launching such a propaganda what does it hope 
to gain vis-a-vis the PKK? 
  [Bayik] It has become impossible to deny the Kurdish 
existence or to try to find solutions based on this policy of 
denial. It is possible that at this stage the Turkish Republic 
might take such steps, though it is a different matter if they 
could be taken sooner or later. Having said that we should also 
state the following: It might take such steps to distance 
people from the struggle. In both cases the taking of such 
steps would be rationalized on the farce that the struggle being 
waged under our party's guidance has been destroyed. 
  The current recourse to such propaganda aims at weakening 
our 
party's domestic and foreign support, and at alleviating the 
growing pressure on Turkey. But, what should be well understood 
is that such tactics have gone stale. The Turkish Republic 
cannot get anywhere with such tactics. Our people, which has 
given thousands of martyrs and made all these sacrifices, cannot 
be satisfied with these offers. It is resolved to attain its 
freedom under the guidance of our party. It will firmly 
continue in its path of freedom, even if that demands very heavy 
costs.

  [Text] Brussels, June 17 (A.A.) -- Former Democracy Party 
(DEP) deputies who had resigned from the party on Wednesday [15 
June] and left Turkey on Thursday, on Friday announced that they 
will not return and `will continue their fight abroad.' 
  They were speaking at a press conference in Brussel's DEP 
and 
International Solidarity Bureau. 
  They said that a demand for political asylum is among 
possibilities considered. 
  The Constitutional Court on Thursday decided to close the 
DEP, on the grounds that it was holding separatist activities. 
  It also decided to abolish the parliament membership of the 
DEP members on the date on which the legal action was launched. 
  The chief prosecutor of the State Security Court said after 
the decision that his office will continue its invstigations on 
the DEP members after the court's decision reaches parliament. 
  He told the Anatolian Agency that after the decision reaches 
parliament, the DEP members would become ordinary citizens. 
  As the members of DEP resigned from their party, one day 
before the decision, five of these went abroad. 
  DEP Deputy Sedat Yurtdas earlier said that Ali Yigit 
(Mardin), Remzi Kartal (Van), Zubeyir Aydar (Siirt), Nizamettin 
Toguc (Batman) and Mahmut Kilinc (Adiyaman) went to Belgium to 
participate in a meeting on the situation of the five DEP 
members and a former one, currently under detention.

  [Text] Ankara, June 18 (AA) -- Prime Minister Tansu Ciller 
on Saturday [18 June] said that the new economic measures will 
bring short-term difficulties but in the long-run will allow for 
the restabilization in internal and foreign balance in the 
economy. 
  The prime ministerial notice on the 1995 fiscal year budget 
call by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller was published in Saturday's 
OFFICIAL GAZETTE. 
  In the notice, Ciller said that the Turkish economy is at 
the 
threshold of an economic crisis because of problems which have 
been left unsolved for years, adding the fast growing public 
sector deficits have led to the disruption of internal balances. 
  The aim of the new economic measures, she said, is to lower 
public sector deficits and inflation, to bring stability to the 
Turkish currency, to speed up exports, and to settle economic 
and social development on a lasting basis that would also care 
for social balance. 
  She said the success of the program depends largely on its 
strict application. 
  "In this framework, besides the 1994 fiscal year budget, the 
1995 one is also of crucial importance.... And the following 
principles will be followed" she said. 
  According to the notice, while the subsidies to public 
sector 
enterprises will be restricted, the completion of projects in 
the development priority regions will be speeded up. 
  Priority will also be given to projects that have obtained 
foreign investment, that will create employment and targeting 
development of economic and social infrastructure. 
  Public sector organizations and companies will have to cut 
their expenditures in the following lines: 

  -  Priority 
projects will be determined while drawing up budgets and 
programs that have lost their urgency will be postponed, and 
those which can be will be eliminated. 
  -  Public sector enterprises 
will, instead of increasing their present expenditures, will if 
necessary restructure to render their services. 
  -  All subsidy 
needs will be drawn up without considering past price increases 
but with reference to future developments. 
  -  The public sector 
enterprises, will prepare their allocation programs according to 
their private incomes as well as their revolving funds. 
  -  Extra 
personnel will be reduced, trips within or outside Turkey will 
be restricted except for indispensable cases, the time of stay 
will be reduced, number of vehicles in the public sector's 
services will be decreased and their use restricted, and 
subsidies for permanent equipments will be restricted to urgent 
needs only.

<F P=106> [Report by Metin Sever and Orhan Gokdemir: "The Economic </F>
Crisis Is an Obstacle Before a Military Solution Too"] 
  [Text] "It started six years ago, it can be completed in 
two years. However, because nobody is being paid, work came to 
a standstill one month ago. The contracting firm KISKA is owed 
about 150 billion Turkish Lira [TL] [approximately $4.5 
million]. We come and go with armored vehicles. The working 
area was raided three times, five vehicles were set on fire, 
three people were killed. Meanwhile, there is no money. Nobody 
knows how the payments will be made. There are 75 armed guards, 
two armored vehicles, and 50 soldiers. Also, State Water Works 
guards are on duty night and day." 
  That is how an official of KISKA described the state of 
affairs at the Dicle dam, part of the GAP [Southeast Anatolia 
Project]. The same official pointed out that work has stopped at 
the Kralkizi and Batman dams as well. 
  The stories about the gravity of the economic situation in 
the southeast are not restricted only to the shattering of the 
dreams about GAP. Rumors are spreading that the soldiers 
serving in the southeast have not been receiving their salaries 
for some time. Furthermore, it is being said that the state, 
including the army and the bureaucracy, owes billions of liras 
to the shopkeepers in the area. 
  A few days ago, journalist Yalcin Dogan wrote in his column 
in MILLIYET: "We are collapsing together with our state and 
middle classes. We are going through the saddest, most critical 
period of the republican era. It is not a joke, we are 
collapsing." Turkey is going through a serious economic crisis 
that makes everyone feel we are collapsing. However, there is 
no agreement on the reasons for the crisis. 
  Since 1990, Turkey has been increasingly sinking into a 
terrorism quagmire. Consequently, more and more are asking: 
"Maybe our economic problems are caused by terrorism?" This 
question can be answered only if we look at the costs of 
terrorism. 
  Here is a list of the expenditures for fighting terrorism 
only in 1992: TL5 trillion to pay 44,372 village guards, TL30 
trillion for security buildings, TL3.6 trillion in compensation 
to civil servants, TL6.5 trillion paid to military, judicial, 
and MIT [National Intelligence Agency] personnel, TL13 trillion 
for one operation in northern Iraq. 
  These figures doubled in the two years since then. At the 
end of 1993, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said that the struggle 
being waged against the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] in the 
southeast will cost TL400 trillion. During the past one year 
and a half, the number of village guards grew to 51,450 and 
their cost doubled to TL10 trillion. The cost of a policeman 
serving in the southeast is almost three times as high as his 
colleague in the west. A teacher who receives TL5 million in 
the west, receives double that amount in the southeast. 
  Some 300,000 soldiers serve in the area. Every military 
personnel serving in the region receives TL4 million as 
"compensation for carrying weapons." So far, 400 helicopters 
have been bought to be used in the struggle against terrorism. 
Their cost is unbelievable: One Sikorsky costs $8.5 million, 
one Cobra $4 million and one SuperCobra $12 million. At an 
average of TL250 billion a piece, the total cost is TL100 
trillion. The hourly flight cost of these helicopters is as 
follows: $2,049 for the Cobra, $8,460 for the Super Cobra, and 
$2,049 for the Sikorsky. Their average flight cost is more than 
TL180 million. If 50 helicopters fly two hours per day the cost 
is TL18 billion. If you add to that the cost of flight of 
warplanes, another TL18 billion, the bill comes to TL36 billion 
per day. 
  The state expenditures for "fighting terrorism" are not 
restricted to that. For example, you must add to that the "Apo 
[PKK leader Ocalan's nom de guerre] compensation." In order to 
keep some 200,000 civil servants in the state of emergency 
region, the state pays them, under the State of Emergency Law, 
compensation termed by the public the "Apo compensation." The 
yearly total of this compensation is TL6 trillion. This is in 
addition to the cost of military, judicial, MIT, and other 
secret organization personnel who are excluded by Law 657. The 
latter figure is around TL10 trillion. 
  Lately, many circles are expressing the same view, and 
loudly: "The war economy implemented by the government because 
of the struggle against the PKK in the southeast has gone 
bankrupt." The economic cost of this struggle was TL100 
trillion in 1993 figures and will be TL400 trillion in 1994. 
This has upset all the balances. The first result of this is 
that the regional economy has become completely paralyzed. The 
shopkeepers have moved to the west, sales have come to a 
complete standstill, bank branches are closing one after the 
other, checks cannot be cashed, and premiums are almost nil. 
Also, the future is unknown for GAP -- a project which had 
formed the cornerstone of the state's long-term program for the 
region. 
  Ahmet Ozer, the GAP Municipalities Union secretary general, 
describes the situation: "There is no substantial industry in 
the region. Whatever there is is either being sold and closed 
down. The region still needs state support. The state's policy 
of encouragement has gone completely bankrupt. As a result, 
there are many half-built installations or installations that 
have been completed but are closed due to a lack of funds. When 
industry and investments did not develop, dependent intermediate 
and side- industries also failed to develop, paralyzing the 
economy. Following the 5 April economic decisions, the sale of 
cars and electrical household appliances dropped steeply, and 
many shops had to close down. Another result of the 5 April 
decisions was that the GAP came to a standstill. There are 
several half-completed dam projects now, workers are being laid 
off, contractors and the state cannot pay their debts to the 
shopkeepers and others who are owed money. The GAP was the only 
means to eliminate the interregional imbalances, to keep the 
economy alive, and to create jobs. Therefore, it should have 
been kept out of the 5 April economic package. The most 
important of all is that nobody is doing anything about the 
security expenditures in the southeast, even though they play a 
major role in creating the reasons for the package in the first 
place." 
<H5>  Our Neighbors Also Face Difficulties </H5>
  It is not only the region that is affected by the suspension 
of the GAP investments. The GAP includes several dam projects 
that were supposed to be used as trump cards in influencing and 
controlling the military, political, and strategic forces of our 
southern neighbors Syria and Iraq. The suspension of the 
investments made the water issue among Syria, Turkey, and Iraq 
uncertain as well. It is a known fact that various 
misunderstandings cropped up between Turkey and its two southern 
neighbors which use the waters of Firat and Dicle when Turkey 
began to build the dams. Especially Syria reacted strongly when 
less water began to flow in Firat with the development of the 
GAP. Syria took the problem to international organizations. In 
return, Turkey claimed that Syria was supporting the PKK and 
instigating the Kurds within the GAP in order to prevent the 
construction of the project. These developments strained the 
relations between the two countries which even resorted to 
taking military measures. 
  In fact, the Turkish General Staff changed its former 
assessment and announced that the "threat" to Turkey comes from 
the "south." This meant that the military buildup would be in 
the southeast. It also meant that the GAP investments would be 
traded for military expenditures. 
  The growing expectations that a "water war" will break out 
in 
the Middle East is laying a heavy load on the economies of the 
two countries. Observing these developments with concern, 
Turkey gave up the idea of reforming its big and lumbering army. 
It also suspended the GAP which it earlier considered as an 
economic guarantee. 
  On the other hand, the weapons Turkey has been buying only 
from the United States and Germany since 1990 are enough to 
equip an army. UN figures show that the tanks and armored 
vehicles bought from these two countries in 1993 are equal to 
the number in the British Army. Most of these weapons are being 
deployed in the southeast. It is observed that great 
difficulties are being encountered in paying for these weapons 
especially after the 5 April economic package. 
<H5>  "The Terrorist Increment" </H5>
  Nobody doubts that the picture at the end of 1994 will be 
very dark. The additional burden of the war in the southeast 
created a TL124 trillion deficit in the 1993 budget. Professor 
Dogu Ergil says the following about the real dimensions of this 
burden: "We can get a picture about the cost of terrorism by 
looking at the budget figures. In 1993, the consolidated budget 
revenues were set at TL344.4 trillion, and the expenditures at 
TL397 trillion. The TL53.3 trillion deficit was to be covered 
with internal and external loans. In the first seven months of 
the year, the government borrowed this amount. Now, it either 
had to print money, or it had to borrow some more. To meet the 
expenditures until the end of the year, another TL130 trillion 
was needed. That was the `terrorist increment.' 
  "The cost of fighting terrorism is terrible. We lose cash 
and investments stop. When you fight terrorism hard, you stop 
big projects such as the GAP. The construction of the Batman 
and Dicle dams stopped. That is a terrible cost to pay. It is 
true, many PKK members are being killed in the southeast, but at 
a very great cost." 
  It seems that the deficit is impossible to close regardless 
of all the saving policies implemented in other fields. No one 
knows what the deficit will be in 1994. We can say, however, 
that the economic crisis looms as an obstacle before a military 
solution.

  [Text] It has been announced that exports increased by 2.4 
percent and imports decreased by 13.4 percent in the first four 
months of this year compared with the same period last year. 
  According to a statement issued by the State Statistics 
Institute, exports totaled $5,049,626,000 and imports reached 
$7,612,978,000 during January-April 1994. 
  A 69.1-percent decrease was registered in the foreign trade 
deficit in April 1994 compared with the previous year. The rate 
by which revenues from exports met the costs of imports also 
increased from 43.7 percent to 70.9 percent in the same period. 
  The foreign trade deficit for the first four months of the 
year diminished by 33.5 percent compared with the same period 
last year. The rate by which exports met imports in the same 
period also increased from 56.1 percent to 66.3 percent. 
  A comparison of the import-export figures for April 1993 and 
1994 shows that exports increased by 2.7 percent, while imports 
decreased by 40.1 percent.

<F P=106> [Column by Mehmet Ali Birand: "Two Important Steps for </F>
Customs Union"] 
  [Excerpts] The question of a customs union between the 
European Union [EU] and Turkey is very important. However, in 
view of the persisting economic instability in Turkey, the 
people tend to believe "it is not the right time to consider a 
customs union." Nevertheless, those who are well aware of the 
matter believe that Turkey stands to significantly gain from 
that process. 
  If we wish to improve our economy in the long run, then a 
customs union is the most reliable system we should adopt.... 
  Ankara will host an important visitor tomorrow. He is former 
Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broeck, who is now 
responsible for the EU Foreign Relations Committee. He will 
hold talks with officials to establish the political 
inclinations in Ankara. Prime Minister Tansu Ciller seems to 
maintain her decisive approach on the matter. Meanwhile, 
significant progress has been made in the talks between the two 
sides in Brussels. The EU-Turkey Council will meet in October 
and the process of achieving a customs union will begin at the 
end of 1994. 
  Whether it likes it or not, Turkey is moving toward 
establishing a customs union with the EU. Of course, neither 
side can force the other to agree to that process. In other 
words, Turkey may decide to abandon it at the last moment. 
However, as things stand at the present time, Turkey can decide 
to abandon that process only if the EU adopts a completely 
unacceptable approach. 
  The two sides are involved in bargaining talks and mutual 
maneuvering at the present time. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  We Must Achieve What We Want on Two Basic Issues </H5>
  Turkey is concerned with two basic issues: 
  1. To redeem its loss. 
  Turkey will incur a loss from its customs taxes and revenues 
from the Communal Housing Fund when a customs union is realized. 
An optimistic estimate is that Turkey stands to lose $2 
billion. However, the Ministry of Finance has disclosed that 
Turkey's loss will total $6 billion. It must have probably 
added the flies to its calculations. The officials in Brussels 
will be appalled if that figure is mentioned to them. We should 
abandon our old habits and draw up a convincing report based on 
basic information. The EU is already aware of what Turkey 
stands to lose. Furthermore, it is ready to help Turkey redeem 
its loss. So, let us not exaggerate the matter. What is left 
to consider is Greece's obstruction. Obviously, the Turkish 
officials should move to visit the EU capitals to discuss the 
two matters. That is unavoidable. 
  2. Question of Limitations. 
  Turkey will apply the customs union system with certain 
limitations on imported commodities to protect various sectors 
in the country. For example, the automotive industry sector 
will comply with the customs union on a reduced scale for a 
certain period. Naturally, the representatives of almost all 
the establishments in the private sector have rushed to Ankara 
to appeal to be included on the list of the establishments that 
will be exempt from the customs union to a certain degree. 
However, a point that should be considered is as follows: The 
EU officials are gladly expecting Turkey to submit its list on 
the commodities on which it wishes to impose limitations. That 
is because they have their own list. Obviously, they will 
extend their list as much as we extend ours. Turkey's textile 
industry is an important item on their list. So they are looking 
for an opportunity to place a reservation on our textile 
industry to prevent it from taking over the EU markets. The 
warning the EU officials have made is as follows: "Do not bring 
up the question of limitations right at the beginning of the 
talks. Discuss the matter at the end of the negotiations." 
  Unfortunately, no one seems to heed that and similar 
warnings 
in Ankara. Apparently we will make a serious mistake if we move 
to raise the question of limitations at the beginning of the 
talks. 
  Naturally, the agreement to be reached on a customs union 
will have to be approved by the EU capitals. Regardless of how 
the matter is considered, the EU capitals will decide on the 
matter. We shall suffer an unnecessary loss if we fail to adopt 
a sensitive approach and if we do not do what has to be done 
until the last moment. (That is what we usually do.) 
  Let us not repeat our old mistakes, at least, let us not do 
so on this matter.

  [Excerpt] Vienna -- Theodhoros Pangalos, Greek minister of 
European affairs and current chairman of the European Union [EU] 
Council, arrived for two days of talks in Vienna on Friday [17

  [Text] Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene is now an official 
candidate for the presidency of the European Commission to 
succeed Jacques Delors. The announcement was made a moment ago 
at the end of today's cabinet meeting. (Philippe Valcoviaque), 
can you tell us how the news was announced? 
  [Valcoviaque] It is now official: The government is backing 
Jean-Luc Dehaene to succeed Jacques Delors as president of the 
European Commission. This was announced at the end of today's 
cabinet meeting. The government also said it hoped a consensus 
could be found in support of Dehaene's candidacy at the Corfu 
European summit next week. 
  After weeks of uncertainty, Jean-Luc Dehaene and the Belgian 
Government have broken their silence. Jean-Luc Dehaene himself 
remained cautious. He hoped the decision would be made in 
Corfu. It would be good for Europe, he said, if things did not 
drag on too long. 
  As to his possible successor as Belgian prime minister, 
Jean-Luc Dehaene said there was no reason to worry about the 
problem until the situation came up.

<F P=106> ["jj" commentary: "Criminal Carelessness"] </F>
  [Text] France has proposed it, UN chief Butrus-Ghali is 
enthusiastic, and now even the WEU [Western European Union], the 
purely European nine-power alliance, is discussing an 
intervention in Rwanda. Nevertheless, it should be considered 
carefully. Be it Bosnia, Somalia, or now Rwanda -- it is always 
the same problems that emerge if one takes a closer look. 
  First: Everything is always more difficult than it looks. 
The Somali "gangs of thieves" have proved to be clever 
tacticians, who even drove the Americans away in the end. 
Second: The old colonial times when a few battalions were able 
to "clear up" among the natives are over. Anyone who goes in 
must be ready to stay. Shooting a hostile headquarters to rubble 
only takes minutes. But creating a durable political order 
takes years. Third: Democracies do not like zinc coffins, if 
there is no solid national interest behind the casualties. And 
fourth: Since the rebels are on the point of conquering Kigali, 
this intervention would indeed come a bit late. 
  Is there a path between the "criminal passiveness," which 
Paris has pilloried, and a criminal carelessness, which pushes 
away the problems that come after the paratroopers have jumped? 
Many African states have long offered soldiers to the United 
Nations. They primarily lack armored personnel carriers that 
would save them from the snipers. Instead of discussing an 
unlikely intervention, the rich European Union countries had 
better send the equipment. In this way, they could save lives 
immediately.

  [Excerpt] France has decided to intervene in Rwanda, 
according to a joint communique issued by the President's Office 
and the Prime Minister's Office. 
  France would like an international humanitarian operation to 
be set up in Rwanda. Its aim would be to put an end to the 
massacres and to save as many lives as possible. 
  According to the joint communique, France is establishing 
all 
the necessary diplomatic contacts. The French forces, together 
with those of African and Western countries, which will join 
them, will carry out their mission until the UNAMIR, the UN 
Mission in Rwanda, is in a position to carry out the mandate 
given by the Security Council. France has now decided to act 
with the help of its natural allies. Ralph Pinto reports: 
  [Pinto] Paris does not want to be and cannot be on its own 
as 
far as this Rwandan crisis is concerned, given that the 
agreement of the UN Security Council is necessary for 
intervention. As early as Monday [20 June] or Tuesday a 
resolution and a plan will be necessary: It is reported to be a 
limited action of a humanitarian nature. [passage omitted]

  [Text] France is doing its best to convince the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF] of its good intentions. We asked French 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who was in Cote d'Ivoire and 
Senegal to raise the issue of African support for this 
intervention, to comment on the issue: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] We have good arguments to convince 
the RPF. What are we planning to do in this operation? For 
example -- and I would say that this is the main aim of the 
operation -- we plan to go in to protect Tutsi civilians who are 
under threat of extermination in areas held by Rwandan 
[government] forces and militias. How can the RPF be hostile to 
such an operation, which aims to protect civilians? We have to 
explain what we plan to do. Perhaps there have been 
misunderstandings, perhaps what we planned was poorly 
understood. I am convinced that we can explain things and 
understand each other better. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Solveig Rodsgaard: "Strategy and Alphabet </F>
Games"] 
  [Excerpt] "We have plenty of time," is Prime Minister Poul 
Nyrup Rasmussen's standard response when the question of the 
election date is raised. 
  That may be so. But all the parties, including the prime 
minister's party, are falling over themselves to get into 
position for the election campaign that has not yet begun 
officially. Every single statement made by leading politicians 
in one party is dissected by the leaders of the other parties, 
and a lot of time is spent on possible party combinations each 
day. It is predictable, but entertaining. 
  Actually an incredible amount of political energy is spent 
on 
establishing a strategy prior to the as yet unknown election 
day. At the same time nothing big is happening in the Folketing. 
The parties always go off the rails in the last part of an 
election period when they know the election must be 
held by a certain date. It is unusual that the parties 
experience an entire election period in strict accordance with 
the text of the Constitution, for decades elections in Denmark 
have been held every other year on the average. The last time 
the Folketing went into the fourth year of an election period 
was in 1987, under Poul Schluter, when practically all of 1987 
was taken up with guessing that the election would be held in 
late fall. However Schluter struck earlier and called the 
election for 8 September. 
  Therefore the fact that it created such a commotion recently 
when Holger K. Nielsen, chairman of the Socialist People's Party 
(SF), spoke of closer cooperation between the SF and the Radical 
Liberals must also be attributed to the current unofficial 
election campaign. His stand was received positively by the 
Radical leader, Economic Minister Marianne Jelved. However 
Nielsen has been talking about this cooperation ever since the 
SF issued a government program that could include the Social 
Democrats, the SF, and the Radicals a year and a half ago. And 
if one looks closely at what Jelved actually replied to Nielsen 
recently, she did not directly invite the SF to participate in a 
government with the Radicals, but acknowledged that the two 
parties have common interests in a number of areas. 
  The Radicals do not feel the SF has passed the litmus test 
yet. This concerns economic responsibility, and as long as the 
SF Folketing members do not vote for the budget bill they cannot 
be accepted as one of the group. According to the Radicals, who 
have always scolded parties that are unwilling to share 
responsibility for the budget. 
  But naturally the hard-pressed Center Democrats (CD) 
immediately dissociated themselves from Jelved's statements 
about closer contact between the SF and the Radicals. CD leader 
and Industry and Coordination Minister Mimi Jakobsen will not 
sit in a government based on SF support. The CD's emphatic 
stance and the continued uncertainty about the placement of the 
Christian People's Party after the election continue to create 
turbulence about the party's cooperation in Poul Nyrup 
Rasmussen's four-party government, to the great irritation of 
the prime minister. 
  Regardless of the uncertainty about the placement of the CD 
and the Christians after the election, the Liberals and 
Conservatives have more or less written off the two small 
parties in the nonsocialist bloc this time around. Both Uffe 
Ellemann-Jensen and Hans Engell have done so publicly. Thus the 
only thing the opposition can do is suggest a VKZ 
[Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party] alternative. And that is 
what they are doing, no matter how skeptical the Conservatives 
are about this constellation at times. 
  The most probable outcome after the Folketing election is a 
continued Social Democratic-Radical minority government that can 
seek support from the SF and/or the CD and the Christian 
People's Party. Drawn up against this government will be a large 
offensive Liberal Party, the Conservatives, and the Progress 
Party, and at the same time the Liberals and Conservatives will 
start drawing the CD and the Christian Party back into the 
nonsocialist fold. 
  Prime Minister Rasmussen will probably not throw the CD and 
the Christians out of the government, although many members of 
the Social Democratic Folketing group and many local party 
people are sick and tired of having to make allowances for the 
two small parties. If Rasmussen dismisses the CD and the 
Christian Party he will have the same problem as his predecessor 
in the prime minister's office. Mimi Jakobsen, Erhard Jakobsen, 
and the other CD members along with the leaders of the Christian 
People's Party have never forgotten how Poul Schluter threw them 
out of the four-party nonsocialist coalition in favor of the 
Radicals after the 1988 election. 
  Those wounds have not healed, nor will they heal. But the 
election results for the CD and the Christian People's Party may 
be so poor that they themselves decide to leave a government led 
by the Social Democrats. Just as the Radicals left the 
nonsocialist government after the election defeat in 1990. 
  However, for the time being the two small parties think they 
are in the right company in the government and that they are 
given extensive consideration. At the national congress of the 
Christian People's Party in Kolding during the holiday at the 
end of April there was no real criticism of the party's 
participation in the government. However party leader Jann 
Sjursen would not say who the party would back after the 
election, but only stated that they will campaign as an 
independent party. 
  And, paradoxically, some of the demands the Christians will 
make for providing a new government base cannot be met by the 
Social Democrats, but can be by the nonsocialist parties. 
  These include such things as the old Christian special 
issue, 
namely the demand that mothers or fathers who stay at home to 
care for their children receive financial support from the state. 
  On the other hand, the Christians are on a collision course 
with the Liberals and Conservatives in their attitude toward 
leave programs and tax reform, among other things. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Erik Bjorn Moller: "Radical Liberals and </F>
Christian People's Party To Fight On Against the Bridge"] 
  [Text] Despite the defeat after Sweden's yes to the 
Oresund bridge the Christian People's Party and the Radical 
Liberals will not be abandoning their fight against the project. 
Now the responsibility for the "blunder" must be placed at the 
right door, Jens Bilgrav-Nielsen (Radical Liberal Party) has 
said. 
  Despite sympathy with their Swedish sister party, the Center 
Party, the Danish Radical Liberals are not taking inspiration 
from Swedish Environment Minister Olof Johansson and leaving the 
government. Alongside the Christian People's Party, the Radical 
Liberals will, however, continue their fight against the Oresund 
bridge. 
  Radical Liberal Folketing group chairman Jens 
Bilgrav-Nielsen 
stressed yet again that the Radical Liberals -- although the 
bridge cannot now be stopped -- will use it in the election 
campaign. He is also demanding that the responsibility for the 
"blunder" be clearly placed where it belongs -- such as, the 
Audit Department's study of the bridge's economic aspects. 
According to Bilgrav-Nielsen the parties that support the 
bridge have a giant problem because the Oresund bridge cannot be 
paid for by those people who will use it. 
  Ole M. Nielsen, the Christian People's Party's finance and 
environment spokesman, stressed that the matter has not been 
removed from the political agenda here in Denmark. 
  "We will continue to work for a sober and realistic 
reappraisal of the whole project. We will therefore, if 
necessary, bring the matter into the context of government 
formation negotiations after the elections," he said. 
  From the environmental viewpoint it is "a tunnel we need" 
and 
"as far as finance is concerned, there is still no reason to 
think that the figures will hold," Ole M. Nielsen said. 
  The Socialist People's Party is now demanding that when 
seeking tenders the Oresund Consortium should seek bids for a 
tunnel which, according to Greenpeace, could be built for 9.5 
billion kroner. 
  "I agree with Olof Johansson that the project is 
misconceived, environmentally incorrect, and expensive," party 
group chairman Steen Gade said. 
  He praised the Swedish environment minister for leaving his 
post after Prime Minister Carl Bildt's "power play." 
  "But the battle is not lost until the contracts with the 
entrepreneurs are signed," Steen Gade said.

  [Excerpts] The final, unofficial results of the local 
elections have been announced. Of the total 28 mayoral posts, 
the National Unity Party [NUP] won 11, the Republican Turkish 
Party [RTP] won seven, the Democratic Party [DP] won four, the 
Communal Liberation Party [CLP] won two, and independent 
candidates won three mayoralties. In Pasakoy [Asha], the DP and 
NUP candidates received the same number of votes. 
  In the five big cities, NUP candidate Semi Bora was elected 
mayor of Lefkosa [Nicosia], RTP candidate Oktay Kayalp mayor of 
Gazimagosa [Famagusta], RTP candidate Sumer Aygin mayor of Girne 
[Kyrenia], RTP candidate Kemal Emirzade mayor of Guzelyurt 
[Morphou], and NUP candidate Mehmet Zafer mayor of Lefke 
[Lefka]. [passage omitted] 
  Party leaders assessed the election results after their 
announcement. In a statement over the telephone carried live on 
Bayrak Television while the count was in progress, Hakki Atun, 
DP leader and prime minister, said that it is very satisfactory 
that the municipal elections were held in a democratic 
atmosphere. Expressing the belief that democracy will be further 
consolidated in the wake of these elections, Atun noted that the 
new candidates will serve the people in the best manner in 
cooperation with the government. He pointed out that the 
existing draft bill granting more autonomy to the municipalities 
will be enacted as soon as possible, adding that the local 
administrations should increase their financial resources to 
this end. Municipalities should offer the best service, and the 
new bill will modernize their structure, Atun remarked, 
stressing that the government will support the newly elected 
local administrators in every possible way. 
  In a statement to TAK [Turkish Cypriot News Agency], Atun 
declared that the local election results will not affect the 
coalition government. Atun underlined that there is no reason 
for the election results to affect the government. Noting that 
his party is participating in municipal elections for the first 
time, the DP leader said: We chose the candidates 
democratically, and we must respect the results. 
  Also in a statement over the telephone carried live on 
Bayrak 
Television, Ozker Ozgur, RTP leader, state minister, and deputy 
prime minister, declared that the RTP is emerging from the local 
elections as the first party. Interpreting the outcome as 
evidence of the Turkish Cypriot people's support for the 
policies of the RTP, Ozgur remarked that this is also related to 
the party's performance in the government. Ozgur said that he 
expected these results because the RTP ministers in the 
government worked hard and established a good dialogue with the 
people over five months. In reply to a question, Ozgur declared 
that the results will not affect the composition of the 
government and added: We must continue the efforts toward 
solutions to all our problems together with our people both on 
the local and general level. Pointing out that his party 
emerged successful from the local elections, Ozgur said that 
this is the victory of democracy. Ozgur also said that 
democracy has entered an irreversible process in north Cyprus. 
  NUP leader Dervis Eroglu, in a statement to Bayrak Radio and 
Television, described the local elections as a success for his 
party. Expressing the belief that the results will relay a 
message to the coalition parties, Eroglu said: Given the 
pressures applied both before and during the elections and the 
current economic difficulties, our people will undertake certain 
actions. He said that the NUP was successful despite this being 
the first time it participated in elections as the opposition. 
Eroglu charged that pressure was applied during the elections 
and expressed the hope that such incidents will not occur in the 
future. Noting that the country is currently experiencing an 
economic crisis, Eroglu said that nothing is being done or 
proposed to resolve these problems. He added: The people, 
however, are making their own decision and are finally achieving 
the results they want. 
  CLP leader Mustafa Akinci announced that he will resign as 
party leader. In a statement on Bayrak Television in connection 
with the election results, Akinci declared that he made this 
decision in order to allow the full rehabilitation of the party. 
Akinci explained that he was unable to implement this decision, 
[word indistinct] Akinci said. He congratulated the newly 
elected candidates. Akinci noted that as a deputy in 
parliament, he will contribute in every possible way to the 
contemporary, productive, and democratic development of 
municipalities. Assessing the local elections, Akinci also said 
that although the CLP increased its votes in several areas, it 
was unable to receive sufficient votes to win the mayoral posts.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the 
Greek Government does not rule out--at least theoretically--a 
meeting with the Turkish side, but clarified that what is 
important are the issues of discussion and the outcome, not the 
meeting itself. He stressed that the so-called Greek-Turkish 
disputes cannot be discussed, because the only thing separating 
the two countries is the continental shelf. Venizelos 
concluded: All the other differences are either violations or 
unilateral pursuits.

  [Text] Nationalist Action Party [NAP] leader Alpaslan 
Turkes has said that the condition imposed by the U.S. Senate on 
aid to Turkey is tantamount to interference in our domestic 
affairs. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Ankara, Turkes recalled 
that 
the U.S. Senate put the condition that the aid to be extended to 
Turkey cannot be used in domestic security. Noting that this 
decision was made as a result of the influence of the Greek, 
Serbian, and PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] lobbies in the 
United States, Turkes said that it is humiliating. 
  [Begin Turkes recording] Our advise to our government is to 
categorically reject this aid. The government should announce 
that a conditional aid is unacceptable. [end recording] 
  Turkes noted that the blind eye turned by the Clinton 
administration to this decision is construed by NAP as an 
indirect support for the PKK. He added that if the government's 
decision to reject the conditional aid is well presented to the 
Turkish workers in Europe, the amount of the aid rejected can be 
collected as donations from these workers. He concluded by 
saying that his party will support such a move.

<F P=106> [Report by Metin Sever and Baran Dural] </F>
  [Text] The IBDA-C [The Islamic Great Eastern Raiders 
Front], which not only defended the Sivas massacre of 2 July 
1993 -- which caused great grief throughout Turkey -- but also 
admitted to regretting the fact that it was not present, showed 
how sincere it is in its views a short while ago when it bombed 
a bar in Fatih, Istanbul, killing one person and wounding 19 
others. 
  The IBDA-C, which aims at carrying out an Islamic revolution 
through armed struggle and teaching a lesson to the "pro-Western 
secularists," has recently featured prominently on the public 
agenda. This time, the issue involved one of the most colorful 
figures in Turkish society, Aysegul Nadir. One wonders: What 
does she have to do with this organization? Apparently, she 
mediated in the sale of a priceless handwritten Koran, which was 
stolen from the Amasya Sultan Beyazid Library by IBDA-C 
militants, to Ihsan Azzami, who lives in London. With Nadir's 
mediation, the IBDA-C reportedly sold the Koran for $8,000 to 
antique dealer Cavusoglu, who in turn sold it for $16,000. 
  The organization managed to earn itself a "significant" 
place 
on the public agenda recently as a result of its "radical" 
statements. The roots of this organization go back to 1975. 
Salih Mirzabeyoglu, who is known as "commander" in the 
organization, has been leading the IBDA-C movement from the 
start. He has had more than 30 books published containing his 
views on almost every topic, from poetry to novels, from 
economics to Islam. He is different from the usual Islamic 
militant type. He tries to look like Che Guevara. His manner 
of dress and speech is modern. He quotes [executed leftist 
youth leader] Mahir Cayan. In other words, he looks more like a 
leftist militant than an Islamic leader. In fact, he even goes 
as far as marking the anniversary of Cayan's death in his 
magazines. The slogans they use are the Islamic version of the 
Dev-Sol [Revolutionary Left] slogans: Instead of "One, two, 
three, or more Vietnams," they say "one, two, three, or more 
Sivas'"; instead of "Struggle until liberation," they say 
"Struggle until victory." 
  In 1975, Mirzabeyoglu left the Raiders Association, which 
was 
a pro-National Salvation Party organization, and established the 
Raider-Birth movement. With his supporters, who organized 
around the magazine KARAR [Decision], Mirzabeyoglu opened war on 
the entire spectrum of the Islamic movement. He says that he 
was supported by Necip Fazil Kisakurek at every opportunity. 
The organization assumed leading roles in the Islamic religious 
headgear and St. Sophie incidents. It made itself heard by 
raiding the Press Museum and a class at the Istanbul Technical 
University, where a professor was manhandled. 
  The IBDA-C considers the Prosperity Party part of the 
establishment today. It is supported by radical Islamic 
movements. In its ranks you can find "hard" [last word in 
English] Marxists of the pre-12 September era, as well as former 
"idealist" militants. 
  The most important characteristic of the IBDA-C -- which is 
really one of a kind -- is its opposition to the state in all 
things. Like Dev-Sol and the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan], 
IBDA-C calls Turkey "TC" [Turkish Republic]. It supports PKK 
activities only to irritate the state. In fact, when the state 
operations in the southeast intensified and the PKK began to 
withdraw, TARAF [THE SIDE], the IBDA-C organ, carried this 
slogan on its cover: "Bosnia-Sirnak." 
  It is possible to understand the basic trait of the 
organization that calls Tansu Ciller "devil" and antiterror 
teams "verger teams" from the following slogans: "Power lies at 
the end of the gun; Point the gun at the invaders; Liberate the 
street, and the city will be liberated; liberate the city and 
the country will be liberated; Blockade!; Trample!; Free 
yourself!" 
  What are the concrete steps of this organization, which uses 
"hard" [preceding word in English] slogans indifferently, and 
what do they see as their chances of achieving an "Islamic 
revolution?" Is the IBDA-C, as the sound-of-mind Islamic writers 
claim, an artificial organization established by the state in 
order to create antipathy toward Islam, or are the IBDA-C 
militants a handful of dreamers who listen to folk songs they 
themselves sing? Abdullah Kiraci, owner and managing editor of 
TARAF, provides answers to these questions: 
  Claiming that the IBDA-C is speedily gaining power, Kiraci 
explains that anyone who wants to join them must meet three 
basic conditions: They must be anti-imperialist, ready to fight 
the exploitation of Turkey, and willing to defend Turkey's 
complete independence. Although Kiraci claims that the IBDA-C 
is not a very demanding organization, his claim brings to mind 
the expression: "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it." 
As a matter of fact, after the "revolution" they are planning 
to carry out, Kiraci is not overly generous about according the 
right of existence to those who do not think like him. You 
should take note now that it is a dream to think that you can 
become part of the system envisaged by the IBDA-C. Kiraci 
claims that the sanctions he is thinking of implementing are 
considered necessary in Islam. According to Kiraci, the 
rightful owners of our lands are Muslims; however, according to 
this organization, the Muslims are prevented from living as they 
wish. Kiraci claims that the day will come when Muslims will 
not be obliged to live with those who create obstacles, and then 
they will implement their own rules. It is up to you whether 
you will comply. If you do not, however, it means that you have 
taken into consideration the punishments envisaged by Islam. 
  Claiming that the organization has reached its goal 
ideologically, Kiraci states that, from now on, the IBDA-C will 
consolidate its front lines and thus march step by step toward 
the "revolution." Asserting that the IBDA-C will have an 
increasing impact on the country's course if Turkey's situation 
deteriorates, Kiraci claims that either they will come to power 
or anarchy will spread and take over. 
  Kiraci is very optimistic about the future of his 
organization; however, it is obvious that he does not receive 
too much approval from the Islamic sector of the IBDA-C. As a 
matter of fact, Fethullah Gulen, a prominent member of the 
organization's Islamic sector and one whom the organization 
accused of being a "collaborator-agent," harshly criticized the 
organization in some of his speeches. TARAF, which has 
published condemnations of National Action Party [NAP] leader 
Alpaslan Turkes, has been attacked by publications close to the 
NAP, and as a result of this clash of ideas, the organization 
was forced to show more "sensitivity" to its idealistic 
foundation. Among those who sharply criticized the IBDA-C is 
Ercument Ozkan, owner of IKTIBAS [ADAPTATION], another 
periodical said to be the voice of the Islamic sector. Ozkan 
even went as far as to say that the IBDA-C is not in the 
slightest degree connected to Islam. Obviously, the IBDA-C is a 
very unique organization. While nowhere near the Turkish left, 
the IBDA-C, in one of its statements, praised the famous 
revolutionary Mahir Cayan on one hand and defended the Sivas 
massacre on the other. One can only wonder what line the 
organization, which now has an autonomous sector, will follow 
and how it will conduct its armed actions. It is not even 
possible to figure out this organization's potential area of 
influence. We still find it beneficial to remind you: The best 
thing for you to do is be careful, because you are not from the 
"TARAF" and one day you may be "put aside." It is for us to 
warn you....

in the Western European Union (WEU) are prepared to provide 
"logistical support" to a proposed French-led military 
intervention to end ethnic bloodletting in Rwanda, WEU sources 
said Tuesday [21 June]. 
  The sources said Italy had again pledged to supply troops 
for 
the operation. 
  They added both commitments were conditional on the UN 
Security Council endorsing the operation and on the 
participation of African countries.

  [Excerpts] Vienna, June 20 (AFP) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has asked North Korea for visas for 
two new inspectors, following Pyongyang's concessions to former 
U.S. President Jimmy Carter, IAEA spokesman Hans Friedrich Meyer 
said Monday [20 June]. 
  He said the delivery of visas would be a test of North 
Korea's will to resolve the latest crisis, sparked by its 
refusal to allow IAEA inspections of a nuclear reactor suspected 
of diverting fuel for military use. [passage omitted] 
  Two inspectors are already in North Korea at the Yongbyon 
experimental reactor, but they must be replaced after having 
worked under difficult conditions, the Agency said. 
  Yongbyon had discharged some 8,000 nuclear waste rods before 
the inspectors could get there to supervise the process, but 
they are still too hot for any extraction of plutonium, Meyer 
said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vienna, June 21 (AFP) -- Two nuclear inspectors 
supervising an experimental reactor in North Korea have been 
granted permission to remain there through mid-July, David Kyd, 
spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency, said 
Tuesday [21 June]. 
  "We made a request to North Korean officials and we were 
granted without problem a two-week extension on the inspectors' 
visas which expire at the end of the month," Kyd said. 
  He said that an IAEA request for visas for two new 
inspectors 
who would replace their colleagues has not yet been addressed. 
  On Monday another IAEA spokesman, Hans-Friedrich Meyer, said 
that that the two inspectors supervising the Yongbyon 
experimental reactor must be replaced as they are working under 
difficult conditions. 
  Some 8,000 spent nuclear rods were removed from the reactor 
before the arrival of the inspectors to supervise the process, 
but the rods are still too hot for any extraction of plutonium. 
  Plutonium is a key ingredient to producing a nuclear bomb. 
  Sources close to the Agency said North Korea has new fuel 
rods ready but there are no signs that it is planning to 
recharge the experimental reactor. 
  They said Pyongyong wants to examine the reactor first, 
especially since some fuel rods had broken, causing a radiation 
leak. But it could be put back into service before the winter 
to help meet the country's energy needs. 
  A crisis over North Korea's refusal to open its nuclear 
facilities to inspections was defused over the weekend after 
Pyongyong promised to allow fresh IAEA visits and offered to 
hold a breakthrough summit with South Korea, almost 50 years 
since the two were divided by the Cold War and the ensuing 
Korean conflict. 
  The freezing of North Korea's nuclear programme and 
international inspection of its facilities is the main condition 
being set by the United States for dropping its threat of 
sanctions and returning to joint talks.

<F P=106> [Report signed "O.P.": "Toward a European Industry Charter"] </F>
  [Text] On the occasion of the Eurosatory land-based weapons 
show, some 12 national trade associations of European arms 
manufacturers, in particular land-based weapons manufacturers, 
are due to sign a charter tomorrow. The document, initially 
conceived in April 1993, is expected to be signed by France's 
GICAT (Association of Land-Based Weapons Manufacturers) and its 
European counterparts: Germany's BDI, Great Britain's DMA, 
Spain's AFARMADE, Belgium's BDIG, Portugal's MID, Denmark's DI, 
Norway's NHO, Sweden's NIF, and Turkey's SASAD. The Netherlands 
Government's position is not known yet, while the Greeks have 
reportedly chosen not to sign the document. 
  The move, initiated by the French, is a first. It is 
indicative of the determination of manufacturers to start a 
campaign, geared toward politicians, in favor of a "Buy 
European" clause. 
  The document to be submitted on Tuesday [21 June] will be 
short (two pages), but it will list some 10 commitments and 
wishes by these European defense associations. Above all, they 
call for a "an overall buy European" clause. Next comes the 
determination to see politicians acknowledge "the vital role of 
research and development," as is being done in America at a time 
when European defense budgets are dropping. The charter calls 
for "European countries to harmonize their needs" and "control 
procedures"; it asks for "active political, diplomatic, and 
financial support" as well as the "preservation of Europe's 
defense industry's vital interests." The document also calls 
for "balanced transatlantic trade relations." In other words, 
in the future, the Americans should buy as many weapons from the 
Europeans as they sell to them. Great Britain, for instance, 
often chose to buy American rather than European. This issue 
currently is attracting a lot of attention since London is soon 
to make a choice between American and European manufacturers for 
two kinds of equipment. First of all, for 90 assault 
helicopters, which represents a 15-billion-franc contract. In 
the running are McDonnell-Douglas' "Apache," which would be 
produced under license by Westland (a British firm not 
unfamiliar with such practices), and Eurocopter's "Tigre" 
(Eurocopter is a subsidiary of Aerospatiale and Deutsche 
Aerospace). London's second choice is for a military transport 
aircraft. Here, it can either purchase Lockheed's C-130J, or 
take part (through British Aerospace) in the development of the 
"Future Large Aircraft" together with other European 
manufacturers. 
  This call for transatlantic reciprocity is a sneer at 
Switzerland's and Finland's decision to choose 
McDonnell-Douglas' F- 18 combat aircraft over the Mirage 2000-5 
of France's Dassault Aviation. Another alternative also springs 
to mind: Sweden is currently looking at two air-to-air 
missiles, one U.S.-made, the "AMRAAM" (recently chosen by 
Denmark) and Matra's "Mica." The charter is an ambitious 
platform, but without political support, it may never amount to 
anything much.

  [Text] Brussels, June 20 (AFP) -- European employers 
called on governments here Monday [20 June] to get off the backs 
of business by cutting public sector spending and lowering 
social charges levied on employers. 
  The Union of Industrial and Employers Confederations of 
Europe (UNICE) said the way to economic recovery lay through 
lowering the burden due to the state, improving labour 
flexibility and boosting small business. 
  "There can no longer be any question of imposing more 
charges 
on businessmen. They are sinking. They are no longer 
competitive," UNICE president Francois Perigot said. 
  He presented a UNICE report entitled "Making Europe More 
Competitive" which said that businessmen needed to wean 
themselves away from state aid and that EU governments should 
not depend on business to fund swollen welfare programmes. 
  The report called for deregulation and privatisation of such 
government sectors as posts and telecommunications, energy and 
transport, plus a more efficient public sector and more open 
public procurement tenders. 
  It urged stricter conditions for unemployment, health and 
other welfare handouts, along with a lower minimum wage, fewer 
restrictions on dismissing workers, and pay rises pegged to 
productivity. 
  Perigot rejected suggestions that governments should fund 
welfare programmes from an energy tax. 
  "For 30 years we have been continually expanding the sources 
of (government) revenue without ever attacking spending," he 
told a press conference. 
  UNICE's call came four days ahead of an EU leadership summit 
on Friday and Saturday which will look for ways to cut 
unemployment and boost Europe's declinin competitiveness against 
the United States and Asia.

<F P=106> [Article signed GF/PVDD: "Van Miert Supports Dehaene for EC </F>
Presidency -- And Demands Ministerial Position for 
Dutch-speaking Socialist Party"] 
  [Excerpts] European Competition Commissioner Karel Van 
Miert believes that "Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene is one of 
the few people who can deal with the complex position of 
European Commission (EC) president." In an interview with DE 
STANDAARD, Van Miert said: "I will be pleased when he gets it." 
He also thinks that if Dehaene does become EC president, the 
Christian People's Party should relinquish a ministerial 
position in the federal government to the Dutch-speaking 
Socialist Party. In the meantime Dehaene seems to be gaining 
ever more support abroad. [passage omitted] 
  Prime Minister Dehaene's cabinet confirmed that the premier 
had talks with his Italian colleague Silvio Berlusconi in Rome 
on Friday evening [17 June], after talks with the German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud 
Lubbers. Berlusconi will receive British candidate Sir Leon 
Brittan in the near future. 
  From a German source, it was reported that Italy preferred 
Dehaene to his Netherlands counterpart Lubbers. German 
Chancellor Kohl is reported to have informed Dehaene of this 
preference. On the basis of this information, the Belgian prime 
minister is said to have publicly announced his candidacy to 
succeed Jacques Delors and visit his Italian colleague. 
  Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez let it be known via 
his foreign minister that he would not veto Dehaene's 
appointment.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Winfried Muenster: "The Miscalculation of </F>
the Bonn-Paris Tandem"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 16 June -- The struggle for the 
succession of the president of the European Commission, Jacques 
Delors, is moving towards its climax. At their summit in Corfu 
next week, the 12 heads of state and government of the European 
Union [EU] will have to choose between the government heads of 
Belgium and the Netherlands, Jean-Luc Dehaene and Ruud Lubbers. 
Yet, the likeliness that, instead, there will be embarrassing 
disagreement, is increasing day by day. French President 
Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl will not catch the genie 
they let escape from the bottle. They achieved a 7:5 majority 
in favor of the Belgian at an early stage and were optimistic of 
winning the support of the entire community apart from Britain's 
John Major and Lubbers himself in time before the vote. They 
calculated that, at the summit, Major would most likely give in 
and Lubbers would be "defeated." 
  However, things have not quite turned out that way. The 
official from the Netherlands, who, contrary to Dehaene, threw 
himself into the race, is with certain success making propaganda 
with some smaller EU partners but also Italy's new head of 
government, Silvio Berlusconi, against the "Franco-German axis," 
which was trying to put Dehaene, who allegedly complies with all 
their wishes, in front of them. If this were true, Corfu would 
become the summit of irony, because Mitterrand and Kohl have 
justified their choice not least by arguing that Dehaene had the 
outstanding skills of accommodating differing interests, while 
Lubbers was tending towards polarizing the club. During a time 
when the Romance south of the community is watching the increase 
in power of the "Germanic" north with suspicion, Dehaene's 
talents would be vital. Yet, now it looks as if the community 
is to be polarized not so much by the man from the Netherlands 
but rather by his opponents. The dividing line would then run 
between big and small instead of north and south. The "axis" 
would itself have disqualified as incompatible with the 
community. 
  One can certainly believe that the chancellor is pinning 
Euro-idealist expectations on the new chief in Brussels. The 
French, however, are guided by national interests. People in 
Brussels have, for example, made the following calculation: 
France's state enterprises, from Air France to the Credit 
Lyonnais and the electronics group Bull, will have to rely on 
subsidies that are incompatible with the EU's competition rules 
for a long time to come. The conflict with Brussels is fully 
underway and is deteriorating in an unprecedented way. The 
French opponent of the French is the most able Belgian 
Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert. He would have to go 
if Dehaene came in, because Belgium is entitled to only one 
place in the Commission. That way, the path would be cleared 
for Edith Cresson, Mitterrand's former prime minister, to head 
the body that is so important for France's future. The 
chancellor will certainly be aware of his friend's ulterior 
motives.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Gisela </F>
Hopfmueller after the cabinet meeting in Vienna on 21 June -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Hopfmueller] After the cabinet meeting, 
Chancellor Vranitzky briefly informed the journalists that the 
European Union [EU] plans to discuss important structural issues 
at the meeting of heads and state in Corfu, where the Austrian 
membership treaty is to be signed, too. The chancellor also 
announced that Austria will present a supplement to Jacques 
Delors' European white paper with the major future political 
goals. 
  [Vranitzky] This will be an Austrian program, outlining our 
specific prospects for the next few years -- on structural, 
traffic, and environmental policy, policy on research and 
science, etc. I have informed the members of the government that 
I will address personal letters to them in the next few days, 
inviting them to express their views so that we will have 
developed an Austrian perspective on a timely basis before the 
formal entry, which will enable us to take the required measures 
at home. These are our preparations for the EU Council meeting 
in Corfu. 
  [Hopfmueller] Mr. Vranitzky, when you meet with President 
Klestil once more this afternoon, will the issues that you just 
mentioned be discussed, or will the final assignment of seats 
and standing room under the Greek sun be the main topic? 
  [Vranitzky] I am primarily interested in issues of 
integration policy and not in the assignment of seats and 
standing room under the Greek sun, or in the distribution of sun 
or straw hats. What I consider significant is that the specific 
political implementation and the specific political work should 
be begun after the referendum that resulted a overwhelming 
support for the integration project. This is the most important 
thing for me. All other issues or secondary topics were 
discussed extensively in the past few days. I have once 
expressed my view clearly, and it is known to everybody now. In 
addition, the individual ministries must define through 
coordination how the work will be carried out in the future at 
the ministerial and bureaucratic level in Austria, and at the 
level of civil servants. These are the major issues. 
  [Hopfmueller] Is the real background to the tug-of-war over 
Corfu not the definition of future competences within the 
European Union -- that is who will represent Austria politically 
in the future within the European Union? 
  [Vranitzky] Well, you used the term tug-of-war. I would 
like to repeat that I never participated in such a tug-of-war. 
However, occasionally I am given a rope by the media. I 
usually put it aside as quickly as possible. 
  [Hopfmueller] Well, you could have others participate in the 
tug-of-war instead of you. 
  [Vranitzky] Well, then I would not be sure whether things 
are going in the right direction. Thus, I refrain from it. 
However, let me repeat the following once more: The next 
government, which will in all likelihood be formed and assume 
office before Austria's formal entry into the European Union, 
will have to discuss and adopt final regulations regarding 
competences. The current government, which will only serve for 
another three months, must prepare interim solutions, which we 
are now doing. I am quite confident that this process will be 
concluded shortly.

<F P=106> [Report by Herta Scharsach: "OeMV Buys Gas Worth 30 Billion </F>
Schillings From Russia"] 
  [Excerpt] An agreement was signed in Moscow last Friday 
[17 June] on the long-term supply of Russian natural gas to 
Austria. Representatives of the Austrian Petroleum Corporation 
[OeMV] and GWH [expansion unknown] (the joint subsidiary of the 
OeMV and the Russian foreign trade organization for the sale of 
gas, Gazexport) signed a delivery contract worth approximately 
30 billion schillings with Gazexport, a subsidiary of the partly 
privatized Russian gas concern Gazprom. 
  Until 31 December 2012, 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas are 
to be supplied annually, which is to flow through Slovakia to 
the switching point in Baumgarten. The newly drafted delivery 
contracts I to III (contract IV covering another 2.5 billion 
cubic meters is drafted on a more long-term basis) will become 
effective on 1 July 1994. 
  "The conditions have not changed basically," Christoph 
Hiller, who is responsible for gas supplies within the OeMV, 
stressed. Austria has been purchasing gas from Russia for about 
25 years. Overall annual imports from Russia currently stand at 
about 5 billion cubic meters. 
  To broaden the basis of imports, the purchase of Norwegian 
gas was started at the end of 1993. The initial quantity of 300 
million cubic meters per year will triple to 1 billion cubic 
meters by the year 2002. Austria has an option for another 500 
million cubic meters. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Leo Custers: "The Reemergence of Mobutu Sese </F>
Seko"] 
  [Text] Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko is using the 
drama in Rwanda to give his international standing a good 
clean-up. His new importance is not due to himself, but to 
Zaire's crucial position in Central Africa. The only safe way 
for the French soldiers who President Francois Mitterrand wants 
to send to Rwanda is through Zaire and not through Tanzania 
because the entire eastern side of Rwanda is in the hands of the 
RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]. Ugandan President Museveni is on 
the RPF side. In the southern Sudan, there is a total war 
between the government army and the south in revolt. 
  At the OAU summit in Tunis last week, Mobutu called for a 
military intervention to end the slaughter and fighting, if the 
warring parties did not succeed in doing so on their own. 
Mobutu used the same words as French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe, also indicating that the proposal to send a multinational 
peacekeeping force to Rwanda was a French-Zairian initiative. 
By supporting Paris's stance, Mobutu increases his own 
importance. 
  Mobutu immediately capitalized on his higher status as a 
French ally in the Rwandan drama. At the end of the OAU summit 
in Tunis last week, Mobutu commented ironically on his "Belgian 
friends." "Belgium and Zaire," Mobutu said, "are two totally 
different things. They have nothing to do with one another. My 
only concern is that everyone should be able to make their bed 
as they like to sleep in it." In other words: Belgium, mind 
your own business. There is nothing in Zaire for you any more. 
  His new self-assurance was also shown in his treatment of 
opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi. Tshisekedi is officially 
still the prime minister, appointed by the Sovereign Conference. 
First, Mobutu gave Tshisekedi a lesson by "arresting" him and 
keeping him overnight. The argument went that Tshisekedi was on 
prohibited military territory. Mobutu wanted to make it clear 
that Tshisekedi was a normal citizen like any other, without 
special rights and privileges, and that he should no longer have 
any illusions. Then Mobutu had the Transitional Parliament, in 
the absence of the Radical Opposition, appoint the old faithful 
[Joseph] Kengo wa Dondo as the new head of government. As far 
as Mobutu is concerned, Tshisekedi is a "negligible quantity." 
And who is disagreeing with him: The groups who supported the 
UDPS [Union for Democracy and Social Progress] leader in the 
past are completely silent now. 
  The objections against Mobutu expressed in the past, 
including by France, have now been forgotten. The French 
paratroopers who, according to Paris, are going to end the 
bloodbath in Rwanda, must after all not only have safe access, 
but also a safe exit route. And that only goes through Zaire. 
For this reason it is important for Paris that Mobutu is on 
France's side at this moment. Moreover no one can predict 
whether and when "something" will happen in Burundi. And in 
that case too Mobutu is the only point of support, not only for 
the French, but also for the Belgians, at least if the Belgians, 
who would then be caught like rats in a trap, are to be 
evacuated. 
  In any case, the Zairian president is seizing the 
opportunity 
offered to him with both hands to promote himself as the key man 
in Zaire. For the last three years, he has been given the cold 
shoulder by Belgium, France, and the United States. The Rwandan 
drama shows that in the present circumstances they can no longer 
allow themselves to do so. Mobutu knows that.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mia Doornaert: "Russia and NATO"] </F>
  [Text] On Wednesday [22 June], Russia, unless it has any 
further surprises in store, is to sign the PFP [Partnership for 
Peace] with NATO. The alliance is pleased at this development. 
At the same time, Russia's membership in this cooperation 
project, to which 20 Central and East European countries have 
already signed up, does not mean an end to a dilemma for NATO 
and now also for the European Union (EU): How to reconcile the 
legitimate endeavors by the countries of Central and East Europe 
to join the West with a relationship with Russia that 
acknowledges that country's specific and special importance? 
  This is a very real dilemma, one that is papered over but 
not 
solved by the PFP. The PFP gives the impression that the United 
States, West Europe, Central and East Europe, and Russia share 
the same interest in a new political and security order in 
Europe. In fact that is most certainly not the case. 
  To start with, the countries of Central and East Europe want 
to join NATO and the EU as soon as possible. Russia, on the 
other hand, wants to retain the old dividing line of the Cold 
War era for as long as possible, and continues to claim a sphere 
of influence in East Europe. 
  With respect to a balance of power, it is perfectly 
understandable that Russia is seeking to maintain the earlier 
status quo for as long as possible, until it is again 
economically, politically, and militarily stronger. But NATO 
and the EU have no interest at all in keeping Central and East 
Europe in a kind of no man's land for an indefinite period as 
this would then threaten to once again become an area of 
conflict between the Russian sphere of influence on the one hand 
and Germany as the major Central European power on the other. 
The consequences of that could again prove disastrous. 
  Russia is perhaps trying to play Germany off against its 
NATO 
and EU partners. But such a power play, totally rejected by the 
German leaders, would not only be damaging for NATO and the EU, 
but also for stability throughout the continent. 
  Russian membership in the PFP does not solve this dilemma. 
And the PFP will in fact be counterproductive if it continues 
to keep alive the illusion that NATO's and Russia's interests 
are one and the same. 
  A clear formulation of differences in approach, aims, and 
interests would not amount to a "lack of respect" for Russia, 
something that Russia is always so quick to claim. On the 
contrary, a realistic approach would provide the basis for a 
mature cooperation, the limits to which would be clearly set. 
One of these limits must be that Russia should no longer be 
entitled to use a veto against countries that are still 
wrestling with the legacy of 40 years of Soviet occupation. 
  It is good that the West is not giving the weakened Russia a 
free ride. But massaging the bruised Russian ego, and this is 
largely what the "special status" recently awarded to Russia 
among the G-7 is all about, does not boil down to policy-making. 
The same criticism applies to NATO and its PFP. It also 
applies to the EU which is to hold a summit in Corfu next week. 
With EU enlargement, Russia's so-called near abroad is also 
increasingly the EU's near abroad. And that calls for an EU 
policy that is more than the wishful thinking of which the PFP 
is indicative.

<F P=106> [Article by Rolf Falter: "Dehaene's Departure Is Test for </F>
Coalition"] 
  [Text] The almost certain departure of Belgian Prime 
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to the European Commission (EC) 
threatens to be a test for the cohesion of the coalition 
comprising the Christians, the Democrats, and the Socialists. 
That was the message released by the government yesterday. The 
CVP [Flemish Christian People's Party], which is again going to 
request the prime ministership, wants clear agreements to be 
reached in advance on the government duties for the next period. 
They also want to know more about the demands of [PS] Jose 
Happart. 
  Although still at the stage of very informal discussions, 
politicians in Brussels have already formed a clear idea of the 
likely scenario surrounding the appointment of Jean-Luc Dehaene 
as EC president, assuming that this goes ahead of course. 
  After next Wednesday's [22 June] summit of the EPP [European 
People's Party], the organization of European Christian 
Democratic parties, where German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will 
announce to the Benelux countries who he would like to see take 
over from Jacques Delors, EPP president Wilfried Martens would 
probably state that a consensus has been reached and Jean-Luc 
Dehaene would for the first time announce that he is indeed a 
candidate. 
  The European summit on the Greek island of Corfu, on 24 and 
25 June, would then appoint the candidate of the European 
Christian Democrats. 
  The ideal scenario would then be for Dehaene to remain prime 
minister until 1 August or 1 September, to pave the way for his 
successor. 
  He will probably have to reshuffle his government even 
earlier, as Pensions Minister Freddy Willockx is to be sworn in 
as a member of the European Parliament (EP) on 19 July and 
should therefore be replaced by Friday 15 July. 
  In addition to the replacement of Willockx and Dehaene, a 
third element is also involved, namely a political compensation 
for the SP [Flemish Socialist Party] for the loss of European 
Commissioner Karel Van Miert, it is only logical to reshuffle 
the cabinet in one single operation. 
<H5>  CVP Van Rompuy </H5>
  In the meantime the CVP [Flemish Liberal Democrat] is 
demanding in increasingly clear terms the right to appoint the 
Dehaene's successor. According to Johan Van Hecke, "it must be 
a Christian Democrat," which must be understood as: Melchior 
Wathelet (French-speaking Social Christian Party) can only 
become prime minister if the CVP does not itself find a 
solution. Anything else would be unacceptable to the CVP, now 
that since Sunday the party is once again easily the largest in 
the country. 
  The candidate who immediately comes to mind is deputy Prime 
Minister Herman Van Rompuy, who has supported Dehaene through 
thick and thin in the past five years. But Van Rompuy would not 
want to jeopardize his chances of leading the next, possibly 
Christian-Democrat-Liberal coalition, by going for an uncertain 
prime ministership now. He would only agree to take over from 
Dehaene if the government could set a clear course for the rest 
of its term and if the coalition partners are prepared to 
continue until the end of 1995. 
  Arguments to this effect have been heard in recent days by 
CVP president Van Hecke and Minister Leo Delcroix. They want to 
see a reassessment of the government program. 
  Then there are the dangers posed by Jose Happart and a 
series 
of matters on the government's agenda for the coming weeks that 
are likely to cause problems with the socialist coalition 
partner: the reform of pension laws, financial responsibility 
for the health service, and the 1995 budget. 
<H5>  Government To Resign? </H5>
  In short, prior to the government reshuffle, the CVP wants 
to 
talk with the PS on its future plans for the government. One 
message can already be heard: The CVP will not give in to PS 
claims. 
  It is unlikely that any of this can be discussed before the 
end of next week, and thus the Corfu summit. The question after 
that is whether Dehaene, when appointed EC president, will still 
have the authority to guide the government through the awaiting 
pitfalls. And whether he still has to take such risks. 
  This is why it is not totally out of the question that the 
prime minister might announce shortly after Corfu that his 
government is resigning, leaving the King to do his 
constitutional work and to charge an official with assessing the 
possibilities of forming a Christian-Democrat-Socialist 
government. At the moment this seems a more likely scenario 
than the ideal one of the retiring prime minister who, before 
leaving office, carefully prepares the ground for his successor. 
  The chances of Dehaene being prime minister when the Belgian 
"Red Devils" football team takes the field in the World Cup 
after 1 July are thus very slim.

  [Text] Dutch Defense Minister Relus ter Beek has rejected 
draft legislation in the United States which would require 
European members of NATO to pay 75 percent of the costs of 
keeping U.S. forces stationed on their territory. 
  The proposed law was approved by the U.S. House of 
Representatives last month, but still has to be passed by the 
Senate. Under the law, Washington would pull a large part of 
its troops out of Europe if the NATO allies were not to agree to 
pay 75 percent of the costs. 
  In Washington, the Dutch defense minister told U.S. 
Secretary 
of Defense William Perry he found the proposals unacceptable. 
Minister ter Beek said the planned burden-sharing was anything 
but fair.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Purple Accord Not Yet in Sight"] </F>
  [Text] There does not appear to be any chance of the 
negotiators' plans for a "purple" coalition comprising the PvdA 
[Labor Party], the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy], and D66 [Democrats 66] resulting in an agreement on 
the main lines of policy within the next few days. After a 
weekend of internal consultation, it is clear that the PvdA and 
D66 now want to press ahead quickly with the formation of a 
government. But the VVD in particular still has objections on 
some major points. "Bolkestein cannot go to the party with these 
proposals," VVD members say. 
  Serious complications have also arisen because the CPB 
[Central Planning Bureau] has proposed, independently of the 
negotiators, intervention in the politically sensitive area of 
the WAO [Law on Labor Disability]. The CPB proposal is that 
people must have worked for at least five years before 
qualifying for any entitlement to disability benefit. Such a 
proposal is not included in the plans of Kok (PvdA), Bolkestein 
(VVD), and Van Mierlo (D66). 
  Last week, the three party leaders sent an adapted draft 
accord to the CPB experts, with the request to test the 
soundness of the social, economic, and financial plans. The 
austerity measures totaling some 20 billion guilders [G] were to 
produce at least 100,000 extra jobs while sharply reducing the 
tax burden, achieving a modest reduction in the public debt, 
and, at least for those on low wages, bringing no more than a 
limited reduction in spending power. 
  On Friday [17 June] came the reply from the CPB. It seems 
that the CPB rejected a major item of expenditure cuts put 
forward by the three political leaders. The new WAO law 
includes a compulsory reexamination of all those registered as 
disabled. This reexamination is supposed to result in many 
people, the Social Affairs Ministry expects as many as 130,000, 
no longer being declared disabled or being classed in a lower 
category of disablement. This would then save G750 million. 
  The CPB believes that Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo are 
banking on something that is far from guaranteed. The savings 
expected by the Social Affairs Ministry are based on no more 
than 4,000 reexaminations. The CPB considers it irresponsible 
to count on savings on such a scale on this basis. 
  On its own authority the CPB has issued a proposal which 
does 
indeed provide for considerable savings. Under this proposal, 
anyone who wants to be considered for disability benefit must 
first have worked for at least five years. Essentially, this 
means that young people will be unable to qualify for disability 
benefit. Such a rule has been applied in Germany for almost 10 
years now. The measure was also included in the VVD's election 
program. 
  The CPB's suggestion was rejected out of hand in PvdA 
circles 
yesterday. The PvdA has already suffered some traumatic 
experiences through trying to meddle with the WAO. In the 
election campaign it always stressed the need to first wait and 
see how beneficial the new regulation proves to be. 
  Criticism of the CPB is growing within the PvdA and D66 in 
particular. "Anybody who thinks that Zalm's computer (Zalm is 
the head of the CPB) can accurately predict the future is simply 
insane," one D66 member said. 
  The VVD remains very critical of a large part of the planned 
cuts. It considers G6 billion of these cuts to be very 
questionable. The VVD finds proposed spending cuts on defense, 
transport, and communications of G1 million unacceptable. 
  The CPB predicts that it will be 1998 before the public debt 
is brought down to 3 percent. If the timetable of the 
Lubbers-Kok government had been maintained, this percentage 
could have been achieved in 1994. The VVD also objects to this. 
  All three parties consider that reducing the tax burden by 
G9 
billion is going to provide too few extra jobs. The CPB 
predicts that it will produce no more than 72,000. 
  An additional difficulty is that the CPB computer only comes 
up with the figure of 72,000 extra jobs if employers are 
exempted from a premium that they must now pay for employees. 
The loss of this premium would have major consequences for 
spending power.

  [Text] London, 20 Jun (WAKH)--Bahraini Foreign Affairs 
Minister Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Mubarak Al Khalifah, who is 
currently visiting Britain, met with British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd in London today. 
  During the meeting, they discussed bilateral ties and 
several 
current regional and international issues, including the 
situation in the Gulf and Yemen, as well as the Middle East 
peace process. 
  Following the meeting, the Bahraini foreign minister 
emphasized that the talks addressed the means to promote and 
strengthen bilateral ties, particularly since Bahrain and 
Britain are bound by a historical relationship. Noting the 
significant developments that are taking place in the region and 
the world at large, he said that the meeting has taken place in 
critical circumstances. 
  The Bahraini minister indicated that the talks addressed the 
current situation in the Gulf, as well as current developments. 
He added that there was an identity of views on these two 
issues. He went on to say that he expressed Bahrain's attitude 
toward the aggravated situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Bahraini foreign minister expressed the belief that the 
British Government's position toward the Gulf region and the 
Middle East peace process is both positive and constructive. 
  The Bahraini minister's visit to Britain is part of the 
consultations and coordination between the two countries. It is 
also meant to promote cooperation between the two countries. 
  The meeting was attended by Douglas Hogg, British minister 
of 
state at the Foreign Office; Bahraini Ambassador to Britain 
Karim Ibrahim al-Shakir; Yusuf Mahmud, director of the foreign 
minister's office; and several officials of the British Foreign 
Office. 
  Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Mubarak Al Khalifah also attended a 
lunch 
banquet hosted in his honor by the director of the U.S. [words 
indistinct] in Britain [name indistinct].

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION news political editor] </F>
  [Text] Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams today urged that 
there should be no Republican tit-for-tat retaliation for the 
Loughinisland massacre in which six Catholics died on Saturday 
[18 June]. 
  And he indicated that the long-awaited Sinn Fein response to 
the Downing Street Declaration on peace for Northern Ireland 
would be made within days. 
  Mr Adams was quoted on BBC Radio 4's The World at One as 
calling for "calm and restraint" in the face of a "premeditated 
attack aimed at deflecting those engaged in the peace process 
from that process." 
  Earlier, he said: "Retaliation has never played a part in 
the 
IRA strategy." Such a notion had been proved to be totally wrong. 
  "Retaliation attacks ordinary Protestants and can play no 
part in Republican strategy. I want to see an end to all armed 
actions. I set my head and my face against any action similar 
to this premeditated sectarian assault on people on the basis 
that they were just Catholics." 
  Mr Adams said: "I would appeal to those I represent for calm 
and restraint. This was a premeditated attack aimed to deflect 
those engaged in the peace process from that process." 
  Asked if Sinn Fein would respond to the peace process in 
the next couple of days, Mr Adams replied: "Absolutely. We will 
not be deflected from our historic task by these actions. This 
is the intention and the aim. We have already met on Saturday 
and we had a positive meeting, a very good meeting, and are 
reconvening within days." 
  He said they would be "democratising within our own 
membership" their plans to push the peace process forward. He 
promised that Sinn Fein would move "as speedily as possible." 
  Mr Adams added: "The IRA are not the only source of violence 
here. What we need is all those armed factions, the British 
army, allies and of course the IRA to be moved into 
demilitarisation to enhance the peace process." 
  Mr Adams said: "This is the challenge facing us. We have 
been reasonably successful in getting the main issues on the 
agenda and focusing everyone -- the British Government, the 
Dublin Government and the IRA as well as the Loyalists -- on the 
need for peace. That is the challenge facing us and that is 
what we will be doing. I hope the British Government has the 
political will to move this situation on, and so we can all move 
forward. Sinn Fein will not be found wanting," Mr Adams said.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Almond: "RAF Grounds Jets in Dispute Over </F>
Civilian Repairs"] 
  [Text] Front-line Tornado F3 fighters and new Harrier GR7 
jump jets have been taken out of service by RAF [Royal Air 
Force] engineers; the Tornados because of alleged inadequate 
standards of repair by a civilian contractor and the Harriers 
because of construction faults. 
  Work on 18 Tornados and the entire fleet of more than 50 
Harriers is seen by the RAF as examples of what can go wrong 
when work is contracted to civilian companies . 
  "It looks likely that we will have to cut out the fuselage 
centre sections of the older Tornado F2's and fit them into the 
F3's," said an RAF official. "But it may take several years, 
and these aeroplanes may never fly again. No RAF engineer would 
do what they did." 
  It was alleged that hundreds of rivet-like fasteners were 
found to have been ripped out by inappropriate tools, damaging 
the pre-stressed metal skins of the aircraft. They were 
returned without comment to RAF fighter squadrons, where the 
condition was noticed by junior RAF engineers. 
  The RAF says there is a vital need for the Service to have 
an 
independent engineering capability. 
  Next month, however, the Ministry of Defence [MoD] is 
expected to announce the loss of about 4,000 RAF engineering 
jobs, the largest single area to be affected by the new Defence 
Costs Study. The study aims to reduce the defence budget by 
contracting more support work to cheaper civilians. 
  RAF officials are worried that the cuts will drastically 
erode the Service's engineering ability, cut repair standards, 
lose its military reinforcement capability -- and could even 
cost aircrew lives. 
  The most serious evidence of what can go wrong are 16 of the 
18 Tornado F3's which, a year after they were allegedly damaged 
while being modified by Airwork Limited of Bournemouth, still 
await repair at RAF St Athan, Glamorgan, as the Ministry of 
Defence and the company argue about an estimated 30 million 
pound repair bill. A court case is expected. 
  Airwork had won a 7 million pound contract to modify the 
airframes, undercutting British Aerospace [BAe], which had won 
an earlier F3 contract, by a substantial amount. 
  The company has since been taken over by Short Bros of 
Belfast, with the exception of the Tornado contract, which stays 
with Bricom, now known as Securiam which was Airwork's parent 
company, according to a Shorts spokesman. 
  Although 38 of Airwork's 40 MoD contracts have been done 
satisfactorily, according to Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Defence 
Procurement Minister, the company has been placed on an MoD 
contractors "special attention" list. 
  This "reduces the chance of Airwork being awarded future MoD 
contracts," Mr Aitken wrote to Mr Rhodri Morgan, Labour MP for 
Cardiff West, last month. 
  The Tornados are needed to be flyable in reserve, 
particularly as 24 Tornado F3's are to be leased to the Italian 
Air Force next year. 
  Perhaps more importantly for the engineers at RAF St Athan, 
however, is the many thousands of hours' work they have had to 
do on all the new Harrier GR5's and GR7's. 
  After one aircraft caught fire and crashed in Denmark in 
1991, and another landed on fire at RAF Wittering, RAF engineers 
found a basic design problem with the Harrier's wiring. 
  American-made Kapton wiring is used in almost all civilian 
airliners, but carbon arc tracking in wiring bundles in new 
U.S.-designed Harriers prompted the U.S. Marine Corps to replace 
the wiring with something else. 
  That was not done, however, for the British-made Harrier 
GR5's and GR7's. Following the fires, RAF officials faulted 
poor wiring standards by British Aerospace, while BAe said it 
merely followed RAF specifications. 
  The result, however, is that in a rolling programme every 
Harrier -- some with only 10 hours flying on them -- has had to 
be returned to BAe and to RAF St Athan to have the wiring 
replaced. Each aircraft has required about 4,000 hours of work. 
  Within months, however the Harriers were brought back to St 
Athan, some after operations over northern Iraq, to have their 
tail sections strengthened because of stress caused by engine 
nozzles. This fault could not have been anticipated. 
  The work, still going on, has involved about another 4,000 
hours. 
  For the RAF, the problems of such highly sophisticated 
aircraft require the highest standards of engineering care and 
that is why there are 17,885 engineering tradesmen in the 
newly-formed RAF Logistics Command. 
  "There is a view that Third Line maintenance (major repair) 
is a luxury," said Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Alcock, head of 
Logistics Command, who concedes that housing costs and school 
fees help make RAF engineers 20 per cent more expensive than 
equally-qualified civilians. 
  "But we have an ability to understand and repair all our own 
technology. We are an intelligent customer that manufacturers 
and civilian engineering companies can't easily fool."

  [Text] The Hague (DPA) -- Outrage and disappointment over 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl are currently dominating the atmosphere 
in the government quarters of The Hague. Politicians of all 
large parties resent the fact that the German head of government 
is obviously vehemently opposing the candidacy of his Dutch 
counterpart Ruud Lubbers as successor to European Union [EU] 
Commission President Jacques Delors. 
  In an interview with DPA, Lubbers' spokesman Jaap van der 
Ploeg even accused Kohl of burdening bilateral relations. "If 
Kohl says that he does not want Lubbers per se, German-Dutch 
relations will obviously deteriorate," he said. 
  However, it is not only the small circle around Lubbers that 
is criticizing Bonn. Over the past years Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, 
the foreign policy spokesman of the Dutch Christian Democrats, 
has repeatedly called in parliament for a stronger political 
orientation toward Germany -- and he convinced many. "Against 
this background it is particularly disappointing that Germany 
and France now give the impression that they are arranging 
Delors' successor between themselves," he told DPA. 
  At their meeting in Mulhouse at the end of May, Kohl and 
French President Francois Mitterrand reportedly agreed to 
support Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene as Delors' 
successor. For The Hague, this came as an unpleasant surprise. 
Three years ago the chancellor said on Dutch radio: "Ruud 
Lubbers would certainly be an excellent Commission president." 
  Now all newspapers are wondering why Kohl has obviously 
changed his mind about Lubbers. The general view is that a 
clarification from Bonn is a matter of urgency. The candidacy 
of the popular prime minister has long become an issue of 
national prestige, and it has dominated the newspaper headlines 
for weeks. "After all, Ruud Lubbers is not just any candidate," 
Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmnas said a few days ago. He has 
been prime minister for 12 years, and thus has far more 
experience than his Belgian competitor Dehaene. 
  For the Dutch, it is no consolation that Dehaene is also a 
candidate of the Benelux states. On the contrary -- Belgium, 
which is a bit smaller, is considered to be a junior partner. 
If the "little brother" were to win over Lubbers, the 
longstanding politician, this would be doubly unpleasant. It is 
hardly imaginable that the Dutch will withdraw in favor of 
Dehaene before the decisive meeting of the EU heads of 
government next weekend. 
  "If Lubbers fails, we will blame the Germans alone," a 
government spokesman has meanwhile threatened. However, there 
are also other voices. "We must not declare a diplomatic war on 
Germany," Frans Weisglas, the foreign policy spokesman of the 
rightist liberals warns. "The relationship with Germany is far 
too important to allow it to be permanently strained because of 
a personnel issue."

<F P=106> [Report by Riccardo Orizio: "Italy Supports Brittan and </F>
Nominates a Number of Its Own Politicians and Academics in 
Exchange"] 
  [Text] The arrangement was agreed last week by Foreign 
Minister Antonio Marino during a secret meeting in Paris: For 
the position of President of the European Commission -- the most 
prestigious of the European prizes in this summer's great 
sweepstake -- Italy will support the candidacy of British 
outgoing European Commissioner Leon Brittan, who is Jacques 
Delors' deputy, and who until now was considered to have fewer 
chances than Belgian Prime Minister Jean- Luc Dehaene. 
  The agreement, confirmed by Brittan's spokesperson, marks 
the 
beginning of a sort of Italian-British axis as regards the 
complex issue of the distribution of top positions in various 
institutions, including the European Union, NATO, the OECD, and 
the WTO [World Trade Organization] (GATT's successor). 
  Dehaene is being supported by both France (because he is a 
federalist, and French-speaking), and Germany (because he is a 
Christian Democrat). For his part [British Prime Minister] 
Major is supporting Brittan, not because Major is convinced that 
he will ultimately win, but rather, to prevent the Paris-Bonn 
axis from achieving too much power. If Brittan is defeated, 
London will demand a substantial consolation prize. 
  Dehaene's true rival is former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud 
Lubbers. Chancellor Kohl tried to convince him to withdraw from 
the contest by offering him the post of NATO secretary general, 
but Kohl was unsuccessful. The decision will be made in Corfu 
at a dinner which is likely to be stormy. 
  Italy will be presenting a long list of candidates, headed 
by 
former Foreign Trade Minister Renato Ruggiero, who is aiming for 
the OECD, and the Socialist former head of government Giuliano 
Amato, who is being considered for NATO. On the other hand, as 
regards the European commissioners, Berlusconi's government is 
preparing to replace outgoing Commissioners Ranieri Vanni 
d'Archirafi and Antonio Ruberti. Two names that are being 
mentioned are those of Romano Prodi and Mario Monti, the rector 
of the Bocconi school. However, [Radical leader] Marco 
Pannella, disappointed at not having been chosen as foreign 
minister, is also aiming for a European position. Another likely 
candidate is European Parliament Secretary General Antonio 
Vinci, who is considered one of the most experienced and 
powerful Eurocrats in Brussels.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Europe's Unchosen One"] </F>
  [Text] The top job in the world's greatest democratic 
grouping is up for grabs this week. It matters who gets it. It 
matters what they think and how they all lead. But -- save for 
some prospective lathering by Norman Lamont and the Tory Right 
-- there is no discussion of the contenders and no hint of 
democracy in the process of selection. This time next week, 
after the Corfu summit, Europe will probably have a new 
Commission President, the heir to Jacques Delors. That ought to 
be important. Mr Delors is a deeply significant figure -- 
departing, with luck, to add a drama to the French presidential 
race. But though the disillusioned voters may choose the MEPs 
[members of European Parliament], if they can be bothered, they 
have no say over the Commission or its president. A stitch-up as 
usual, to baroque conventions. Delors was a Socialist from a 
big country: custom and practice demand that he is succeeded by 
a sort of conservative from a small country. 
  Two men are first out of the frame: Ruud Lubbers, lately 
prime minister of the Netherlands, and Jean-Luc Dehaene, present 
prime minister of Belgium. A year ago, all the betting was on 
Lubbers, but he has fallen out with Chancellor Kohl, up whose 
capacious waistcoat most of the wheeling and dealing takes 
place. Kohl and soon departing Francois Mitterrand have thus 
settled for Dehaene, a capable, rather grey political operator. 
This can all be portrayed -- see those Tory latherings -- in 
terms of manic or less manic attachment to the European federal 
project. That's probably unfair to Dehaene, an expert on 
integration rather than a zealot. But it does not begin to 
address the fears and hopes of the people of Europe, as 
expressed seven days ago through the ballot box. 
  Corfu will be horse-trading as usual. The British and the 
Greeks will back Sir Leon Brittan for a while; and so probably 
will the Italians, until gradually the offers of other jobs -- 
like the Secretary Generalship of Nato -- and sundry favours 
gradually dissolve the blocs. (Sir Leon is a heavyweight in 
line for the big foreign affairs portfolio next time; his 
trouble is that he's John Major's candidate.) So only if the 
council is irredeemably split between Lubbers and Dehaene will 
the ranks of the undeclared but available begin to be talked 
about. We hope that happens, because the best second choice may 
actually be the best first choice: Peter Sutherland from 
Ireland, whose mastery of the Gatt free trade ship steered it 
safely into port. Sutherland is more international civil 
servant than politician to be sure -- but he has the grasp and 
the personality to give the Commission an identity which 
explains and persuades rather than retreats behind closed doors. 
  But how can a voter -- or a newspaper -- affect any of these 
developments? The bargaining will be secret and frenetic. No 
leader in Corfu will have a remotely democratic mandate. The 
old pie, with plums for the taking, is being cooked up as usual. 
And, shortly thereafter, we'll be treated to all the usual 
stuff about unelected Brussels bureaucrats. So be clear as the 
storm starts to break. The bureaucrats are unelected because 
that's the way national governments want it. Even the chief 
bureaucrat -- who is much more than that -- emerges in ways that 
would make the next Pope weep in shame. Jacques Delors, a 
testimony to his reign, has made the presidency too crucial to 
be carved around in this fashion any longer. If the European 
project is losing touch with the people of Europe, who on earth 
can wonder at that?

<F P=106> [Report by Stephen Bates: "EU Sceptics Reopen Tory Rift"] </F>
  [Text] Euro-sceptic back-benchers were last night flexing 
their muscles once again to end John Major's brief respite from 
party criticism by pressuring him to veto the pro-federalist 
Belgian prime minister, Jean-Luc Dehaene, as new president of 
the European Commission. 
  The Prime Minister faces being painted into a corner at this 
week's European Union [EU] leaders' summit in Corfu, where the 
choice will be made on Friday [24 June] or Saturday, and may 
once more end up in a minority of one. 
  Britain backs former cabinet minister Sir Leon Brittan to 
succeed Jacques Delors next January but Germany and France are 
supporting Mr Dehaene, who is favourite to gain the post. 
  EU leaders are to decide on their favoured candidate at 
Corfu 
amid suggestions that it is time for one of the smaller member 
states to have their candidate chosen, either Mr Dehaene or his 
rival the Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers, with Ireland's 
former European Commissioner Peter Sutherland emerging as a 
possible compromise candidate. 
  As backstage wrangling continued about the successor to Sir 
Norman Fowler as Tory chairman, some vocal Euro-sceptics, such 
as Sir Teddy Taylor, were also seizing the moment yesterday to 
threaten restoration of internecine warfare on Europe over 
increases in Britain's net contributions to the EU in two years. 
  The rises, agreed at the EU's Edinburgh summit under Mr 
Major's presidency nearly two years ago, will see Britain's 
contributions increase, in line with those of other countries, 
from 1.7 billion pounds this year to an estimated 2.8 billion 
pounds in 1995/6. 
  The Government has so far delayed the introduction of a 
bill, 
promised in last November's Queen's Speech, enabling an 
increase, and it may now be put back until the autumn. 
  Although the sceptics conceded yesterday they cannot block 
the legislation, they may yet disrupt its passage. 
  Yesterday, embittered former chancellor Norman Lamont, 
sacked 
by Mr Major a year ago, called on the Prime Minister to veto the 
Dehaene candidacy. Implying vacillation by Mr Major, he said in 
a BBC interview: "It is an absolutely crucial decision. We have 
spent the last two years arguing against the proposals of 
Jacques Delors. We do not want to have more of the same for the 
next two years. We must make up our mind, stick to it and be 
determined. Unless you take a firm position and stick to it you 
never win anything." 
  Pro-European Tories see the Dehaene decision as not worth 
the 
veto. They pointed out that 10 years ago Lady Thatcher vetoed 
Claude Cheysson and ended up with a candidate she liked even 
less in Mr Delors. 
  Meanwhile, with manoeuvring still continuing over the party 
chairmanship and former holders of the job Lord Parkinson and 
Kenneth Baker still urging the appointment of Michael Heseltine 
who does not want it, Lord Archer appeared to be moving up the 
list. He won the backing of constituency activists in one 
Sunday newspaper poll as a tribute to his indefatigable touring 
of local associations. 
  No longer bothering to disclaim his ambition, he said: "I 
have always been fascinated by that side of politics but I am 
quite happy to serve the Conservative Party in any capacity the 
Prime Minister says." 
  David Hunt, the Employment Secretary, the favourite for the 
job, likewise suggested, though with noticeably less enthusiasm, 
that he would accept any challenge Mr Major offered.

<F P=106> [EC press release No. PESC/94/57: "Statement of the </F>
Presidency of the European Union on Mostar"] 
  [Text] The Council approved the Memorandum of 
Understanding of the EU administration of Mostar which had been 
negotiated and initialled in Brussels on 8-9 June 1994 with 
Croat and Bosniac delegations from Mostar. The Council welcomed 
the considerable efforts which the two parties from Mostar had 
made and which showed their willingness to make further progress 
towards mutual reconciliation. This Memorandum of Understanding, 
when signed by all parties, will be the decisive step towards 
the early establishment of the EU administration. 
  The Council calls on the parties from Bosnia-Hercegovina to 
approve the Memorandum of Understanding on their side as soon as 
possible, thus opening the way for signature. It hopes that this 
will take place very soon. In making this major contribution to 
the restoration of peace and stability in an important town 
which has been the centre of much fighting and misery, the 
European Union recalls that success will only be assured if all 
concerned in Mostar and the region cooperate fully. It hopes 
that the restoration of cooperation between the communities in 
Mostar will be a model for other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Slovenia/Italy: Martino on </F>
Relations"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Luxembourg, June 13 -- Italy's Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino played down reported friction with 
Slovenia, Monday [13 June], saying that the problems which have 
arisen are "rather small scale." 
  Martino pointed out that a joint committee is already at 
work 
on resolving outstanding issues, after which "we will support, 
with sincere enthusiasm, an association deal between Slovenia 
and the European Union [EU]." 
  Martino was speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of EU 
diplomatic chiefs to lay the groundwork for the June 24-25 EU 
summit in Corfu. Slovenia was one of the items on the agenda 
for today's talks. 
  Geography has "condemned Italy and Slovenia to being 
neighbours" and "history has condemned them to being friends" 
said Martino in a press conference, "I am convinced that these 
two countries will remain friends." 
  At the centre of the friction has been Italy's reluctance to 
back a Slovenian EU membership bid until the former Yugoslav 
state has fulfilled all the conditions of the Osimo Treaty which 
fixed borders between Italy and Yugoslavia. Italy is demanding 
that Italians be allowed to regain land in Istria confiscated by 
Yugoslav authorities.

Italian Steel Aid"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, June 15 -- The European Commission 
today gave the go-ahead to 790 billion lire in aid for Italy to 
help 68 private steel firms make capacity cuts, breathing fresh 
life into an EU [European Union] steel plan that had seemed 
moribund. 
  EU Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert will illustrate 
the decision -- to be put to EU industry ministers on Wednesday 
[22 June] -- to Italian Industry Minister Vito Gnutti in Rome 
tomorrow. 
  EU Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann said that "cutting 
5-6 million tonnes from Italy's private steel producers is the 
only chance we have to get up to the minimum European target of 
19 million tonnes, allowing us to apply the steel plan." 
  "Each of the 68 aid cases will have to be notified by Italy, 
and will be examined individually," van Miert said, underlining 
the need to "swiftly act on the Commission's June decision."

  [Text] Paris, June 16 (CTK) -- Due to the increased 
importance of the Western European Union (WEU) within the 
European Union (EU), the Czech Republic's intensified 
integration with the EU also means coming closer to the Western 
defense systems, Petr Necas, head of a parliamentary delegation, 
told CTK today. 
  The delegation attended the four-day WEU parliamentary 
assembly which finished today. 
  The Czech Republic was granted WEU associate partnership on 
May 9. 
  The Czech Republic's integration with the EU has not only 
economic and political dimensions, but also a clear-cut defense 
and security aspect, Necas added. The sooner the Czech Republic 
joins the EU, the sooner it will join the WEU or NATO, he 
specified. 
  The Czech delegation stressed that it was not correct -- as 
it has frequently appeared in the WEU documents -- to regard all 
the Central and Eastern countries as one bloc. It pointed to 
"wide economic, political, and security differences" between 
these countries. "We had to note that the Czech Republic was 
stable, heading for prosperity, and undertaking reforms 
supported by its population," Necas said. 
  The Czech delegation has also assured the Western deputies 
that the Czech effort to come closer to the WEU was not just a 
"panic calling for a security umbrella" in the form of 
guarantees, but a sign of sharing the same values. "We want to 
protect these values. We want to share our part of 
responsibility as evidenced by the presence of the Czech troops 
in the Persian Gulf and now in the former Yugoslavia," Necas 
said. 
  The Czech deputies asked the deputies from the nine WEU 
member countries to make it possible at their autumn session for 
the Czech Republic and other Eastern countries to fully join the 
work of the Assembly, except for the voting right. WEU 
representatives promised that the association status which was 
under preparation would correspond to this. The Czech deputies 
proposed that representatives of the WEU and Eastern countries 
meet to discuss the contents of the associate partnership in the 
coming months in Prague.

<F P=106> [Reports by Michael Evans: "Defence Cuts Force Closure of </F>
Rosyth and RAF Bases"] 
  [Text] Ministers are bracing themselves for an announcement 
next month that Rosyth naval base will be dosed, the RAF will 
withdraw from Germany and the jobs of about 22,000 servicemen 
and women will be lost. 
  The bulk of the job cuts, though not all through redundancy, 
will fall on the RAF. RAF chiefs will have to accept wholesale 
privatisation of many of its repair and maintenance units. 
  RAF manpower levels are expected to fall from 70,000 to 
60,000 by the end of the decade. The only consolation for 
departing RAF engineers and mechanics is that many of them are 
expected to be recruited by commercial companies, who are likely 
to win contracts to maintain frontline aircraft in place of the 
RAF. 
  The latest round of defence cuts follows completion of the 
study Frontline First, commissioned to prune all support 
services to meet Treasury demand for a reduction in the budget 
of 750 million pounds a year from 1996-97. 
  The most controversial item in next month's cuts will be the 
closure of Rosyth, which employs 4,000 navy and 1,800 civilian 
workers. 
  The RAF withdrawal from Germany may not be announced next 
month, although the decision has been taken in principle, 
subject to consultations with the Germans and Americans. 
  Gordon Brown, the shadow Chancellor, whose Dunfermline East 
constituency contains Rosyth, said Labour and the unions would 
vigorously oppose any attempt to close the naval base. 
  Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, is still negotiating 
with the Treasury about some aspects of the cuts package, which 
will be announced on July 14. One point of disagreement is over 
additional savings Mr Rifkind has managed to find during the 
six-month study. 
  An extra 100 million pounds a year in savings has been 
identified, over and above the 750 million pounds sought by the 
Treasury, and Mr Rifkind wants to plough some of the money back 
into training and increasing RAF pilots' flying time. However, 
the Treasury insists that any remaining funds must be passed 
back and made available for other government requirements. 
  Mr Rifkind will be summoned before the Commons Defence 
Select 
Committee during the summer recess to be questioned about the 
cuts (Jill Sherman writes). 
  Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the committee's chairman, said the 
civil 
servants responsible for the 33 areas that have been under 
scrutiny would also be called to give evidence. Sir Nicholas 
said any attempt to cut the defence budget further next year 
would be opposed by senior backbenchers. 
  Downing Street sources said Whitehall was "leaking left, 
right and centre" and insisted that no decisions had been taken 
about the defence cuts.

<F P=106> [Article by Howard Davies, director general of the </F>
Confederation of British Industry: "Industry's Advice to 
Europe"] 
  [Text] Next week is a crucial one for the EC. The 
outcomes of the social affairs council meeting on Wednesday [22 
June], and the Corfu heads of government summit at the weekend 
will show whether Europe's policymaking institutions are capable 
of meeting the needs of European business, and of Europe's 18 
million unemployed. 
  On Wednesday the Commission will once again ask social 
affairs ministers of the 11 (excluding Britain) to agree the 
European Committee, nee works council directive. (Like 
companies in trouble, this directive changes its name quite 
frequently.) It is unanimously opposed by Europe's employers, 
on the ground that it will not, as it purports to do, improve 
information and consultation procedures. Rather, it will impose 
a rigid bureaucratic structure on a range of diverse practices 
across Europe, which, by and large, work well. 
  David Hunt will be sent to mix the ouzos while this item is 
discussed, but there are signs that the other ministers are not 
as united as they once were, now that they have registered the 
strength of business opinion. The Portuguese and Italian 
governments are openly doubtful about the wisdom of going 
forward, and the French have suggested a more leisurely progress. 
  UNICE, the European employers' body to which the CBI 
[Confederation of British Industry] belongs, has put forward a 
compromise. The social affairs council should pass an outline 
directive requiring large, Europe-wide companies to agree 
information and consultation procedures with their workforces, 
where they do not already have them, but without specifying any 
particular structures. In five years' time, the Commission 
should review the position. If then many companies have still 
failed to agree a consultation mechanism with their employees, 
the Commission would be justified in proposing minimum 
requirements. 
  Commissioner Padraig Flynn should advise the Council that 
that is the best way forward. It will avoid a damaging row with 
employers, for whom this is a touchstone by which to judge the 
Community's social policy. He should also tell the ministers 
that the consultations on his Green Paper have achieved no 
consensus in favour of another ambitious social action 
programme, so that the White Paper he brings forward shortly 
will be a modest document, focusing on areas in which progress 
across Europe is very mixed (such as equal opportunities). 
  A radical new social action programme would, of course, be 
quite inconsistent with the Delors White Paper of last December. 
Indeed, some of us have been puzzled by the relationship 
between Jacques Delors's White Paper and the Flynn Green Paper, 
which seem to differ in a lot more than colour. 
  The heads of government meeting should make it clear that 
the 
Delors' paper is predominant. And the summit should concentrate 
on pushing forward some useful initiatives which have emerged 
from discussions of it. Specifically, the heads of government 
should endorse the proposal for a business-led group to review 
the scope for deregulation. It should be an independent body, 
able to publish its evidence and proposals. The Commission 
would prefer a creature of its own to do the job; that would be 
a mistake. 
  The summit should also endorse the conclusions of the "high 
level group" set up under Commissioner Martin Bangemann on what 
is mysteriously known as "European information society." Their 
report, to which Peter Bonfield of ICL [International Computers 
Limited] and Peter Davis of Reed Elsevier -- the British 
representatives on the group -- have contributed a lot is a good 
one. It endorses the principle of market liberalisation of 
telecommunications across Europe, sketches out the exciting 
possibilities thrown up by information superhighways and 
describes a modest but important role for the Community, 
focusing on creating the right regulatory environment. 
  The report does not support the case for Commission-directed 
investment. Indeed, the Corfu summit would do well to bury the 
"union bonds" idea in the sand. It is not relevant to the 
European information society and should not be needed to promote 
trans- European networks, the subject of a second working group 
under Commissioner Henning Christopherson, which has not yet 
reported. 
  Lastly, of course, the summit should address the leadership 
question. There is no doubt that, on their merits, both Sir 
Leon Brittan and Peter Sutherland are very strong candidates to 
succeed Jacques Delors. But we are told that Jean-Luc Dehaene 
or Ruud Lubbers is more likely to secure majority backing 
(though the French may now feel that Jimmy Goldsmith would do 
less damage in Brussels than in France). 
  Whoever is chosen should be told to take a bottle of retsina 
and the OECD jobs study to the nearest taverna before he begins 
to speak about Europe's new social agenda.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nuclear Clean-Up May Cost 12 Billion </F>
Pounds"] 
  [Text] The cost of cleaning up the legacy of Britain's 
atomic research programme could be 12 billion pounds, four times 
as much as was estimated four years ago. Tim Eggar, the energy 
minister, published the revised costs in a parliamentary answer 
yesterday, when most MPs had left for the weekend. 
  Detailed engineering studies suggested that nuclear 
liabilities at UKAEA [UK Atomic Energy Authority], the former 
atomic energy authority, amounted to 8 billion pounds, Mr Eggar 
said. However, "the total cost could lie in the range 6 billion 
pounds to 12 billion pounds." 
  The figures compare with decommissioning liabilities 
estimated at 3 billion pounds to 4 billion pounds in 1990. 
  UKAEA has been divided in two, because ministers hope to 
introduce legislation to pave the way for a sale of AEA 
Technology, the engineering arm, in October. Decommissioning 
liabilities will stay with the UKAEA government division and be 
met by the taxpayer. 
  Derek Pooley, the division's chief executive, said the 
unique 
nature of each research reactor posed problems that were greater 
than expected, and the rundown of the research programme 
highlighted maintenance costs previously ignored. 
  UKAEA is responsible for decommissioning a host of 
experimental facilities, including reactors at Dounreay, 
Harwell, Windscale and Winfrith that have been used to produce 
fuel for nuclear weapons or as prototypes for electricity 
generation. Most of them were built between 30 and 50 years ago. 
  "These facilities were built with not nearly enough thought 
about what you would do with them when you no longer need them," 
Mr Pooley said.

<F P=106> [Report by Ross Tieman and Philip Bassett: "CBI Confirms </F>
Recovery and Takes a Look at Labour"] 
  [Text] Britain's recovery is now firmly established, and 
apparently at little risk from a runaway consumer boom, the CBI 
[Confederation of British Industry] said yesterday. It added 
that a changed Labour Party deserved to be taken seriously. 
  The economy is moving into a "new era" in which the main 
priorities are to "structure and shape the recovery," said 
Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general. He said business 
must also adapt to the changing political scene, fundamental 
shifts in Labour policy and the impending emergence of a new 
Labour leader. The director-general spoke against the 
background of a reassuring assessment of key economic trends 
from the CBI's quarterly distributive trades survey. 
  The survey, published yesterday, showed the rate of sales 
growth in UK shops slowed slightly in May, yet remained ahead 
year on year. Subdued activity in the high street continued to 
disappoint retailers who have been seeking a strong upsurge for 
four years, but have yet to see their expectations fulfilled. 
  Activity in the wholesaling sector remains brisker, but 
Nigel 
Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said 
there was no sign that stocks were being built up in expectation 
of a surge in high street spending. Rather, retailers most 
vigorous customers appeared to be industrial concerns. 
  Sales on garage forecourts, meantime, were weaker than 
expected. Mr Whittaker said: "Overall, sales for the time of 
year remain average, although there has been little change since 
the start of the year." He said that tax rises which took 
effect in April, "do not appear to have had any real impact on 
high street recovery." 
  Mr Davies, speaking to the British Printing Industries 
Federation, said it was now accepted that the UK was out of 
recession, but in advance of official earnings increase figures, 
to be published by the Government today, he stressed again the 
danger to the recovery from wage inflation. At the same time, 
Mr Davies insisted business must recognise a changed Labour 
Party under a new leader. 
  While the CBI's statement is far short of any endorsement 
for 
Tony Blair, it is significant both in terms of business 
attitudes and the ability of the frontrunner for the party 
leadership to appeal successfully to areas beyond the Labour 
Party. Mr Davies said it was likely that business would be 
facing a Labour party unemcumbered by baggage from its periods 
in government and with a set of economic policies very different 
from those of the past. 
  He said there were aspects of the new Labour programme 
business did not like, including its support for the social 
chapter, the minimum wage and legislation on company board 
structures. In spite of these, he said: "It would be churlish 
not to recognise the Labour Party has changed in important ways, 
and is offering a set of policies which at the very least 
deserve our attention."

<F P=106> [Excerpts of speech by Eddie George, governor of the Bank of </F>
England, at Mansion House in London on 15 June] 
  [Text] The British economy is in its third year of 
expansion. But not only that, over the past year, the rate of 
growth has exceeded the rate of inflation. There have been only 
12 years since the war in which the rate of growth has exceeded 
the rate of inflation in this way and only four years since 1970. 
  Of course it is not enough. We can't be satisfied with this 
achievement in a single year. The challenge is to improve on 
this performance and sustain it year after year. 
  And, if you won't find this shocking coming from a central 
banker, I believe the prospects are encouraging. First, there 
is the improvement in the world economy, including the recovery 
now clearly visible in our major markets on the Continent. 
  Second there is the improved supply-side flexibility of our 
own economy, in both the goods and services and the labour 
markets, following the deregulation and liberalisation that has 
characterised the last decade and more. Compared with many 
countries, in continental Europe certainly, this means that we 
are relatively well placed. 
  Third there is our prospective fiscal position. The action 
taken by the Government, and indeed by our present Chancellor, 
last year, progressively to reduce the PSBR [Public Sector 
Borrowing Requirement] was never going to be popular whatever 
form it took. 
  But such action was crucially necessary. It was necessary to 
achieve a proper balance between domestic and external demand. 
It was necessary to make room for private-sector expenditure 
and for a shift in the balance of private spending from 
consumption to investment, without which the expansion could not 
be sustained. 
  Finally, there is the monetary policy framework, which I 
believe gives us a better chance of moving towards our goal of 
price stability in the medium term than at any stage in my 
professional lifetime. Since we came out of the ERM [Exchange 
Rate Mechanism], a series of steps have been taken to make our 
objective unequivocally clear and the policy process almost 
totally transparent. The latest step, the Chancellor's recent 
decision to publish the minutes of our monthly monetary policy 
meetings will, in time, do a great deal to improve public 
understanding of our shared commitment to continuing low 
inflation. It may, though, spoil the fun for some of the 
pundits who will no longer need to speculate about possible 
disagreements. 
  The testing time will come, as it must inevitably come 
sooner 
or later, when we need to raise interest rates in order to 
moderate the pace of expansion and pre-empt the emergence of 
associated cost and price pressures. With the economy still 
operating below capacity, though no-one can know just how far 
below, it may be that this point is still some way off. 
  But whenever it comes, I hope that it will be regarded 
positively, as a considered response to the underlying strength 
of the economy and to the prospect for inflation in the medium 
term, and not as evidence of weakness, in simple knee-jerk 
reaction to the latest set of erratic monetary or economic data. 
  Our purpose will be to maintain the expansion at a 
sustainable pace, and not to leave the tightening of policy so 
late that the economy is brought to a juddering halt by a much 
larger interest- rate rise than would otherwise be needed. 
  It is a realistic hope that next year I will be able to 
report on a second consecutive year of growth above the rate of 
inflation and I even venture to look forward to the year after 
next.

<F P=106> [Report by George Jones: "Tory Battle To Succeed Fowler as </F>
Party Chief"] 
  [Text] Power struggle for the key post of Conservative 
Party chairman was triggered at Westminster last night by the 
decision of Sir Norman Fowler to step down before next month's 
Cabinet reshuffle. 
  Although his resignation came as no surprise, the timing 
threatens further turmoil within an already demoralised Tory 
Party. 
  Last night Right-wing Conservative MPs were mobilising to 
try 
to block the appointment of Mr David Hunt, the Employment 
Secretary, who is on the Left and a committed pro-European. 
  A head of steam was also building up behind backbench calls 
for Mr Michael Heseltine, the President of the Board of Trade, 
to take on the high-profile role. 
  Mr Heseltine has made it clear to friends he does not want 
the chairman's job. But more and more MPs are telling Tory 
whips that they believe he alone has the flair and dynamism to 
pull the party back from its worst ever defeat in last week's 
European elections. 
  According To Government insiders, Mr Major has not yet made 
up his mind on a successor, and there are at least four or five 
candidates. 
  Other front-runners include Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish 
Secretary, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the Agriculture Minister; Mrs 
Virginia Bottomley, the Health Secretary; Mr Jonathan Aitken, 
currently outside the Cabinet as Minister for Defence 
Procurement; and Mr Tony Newton, the Leader of the Commons. 
  Sir Norman will carry on as chairman until a successor is 
appointed in a reshuffle expected in mid to late July. Although 
he was not a member of the Cabinet, it is traditional for the 
party chairman in the second half of a Parliament to be a senior 
minister. 
  It had been known for some time that Sir Norman wanted to 
quit Conservative Central Office to concentrate on his business 
career, but the timing of the announcement caused surprise at 
Westminster. 
  It was seen as a deliberate attempt to distance his 
resignation from the reshuffle, and show that he is stepping 
down of his own free will rather than being dropped. 
  However, his departure will put pressure on Mr Major to 
speed 
up the Government changes. Earlier this week he ruled out a 
reshuffle in the immediate aftermath of the Euro-elections, but 
confirmed he would carry out a mid-term reconstruction by the 
end of July. 
  Sir Norman's announcement is bound to increase speculation 
at 
Westminster about the scale of the Cabinet changes. 
  Already there are signs that talk of a reshuffle is having a 
destabilising effect on Whitehall, with some key Government 
announcements including a policy paper on Civil Service reform, 
delayed until the future shape of the Government is clear. 
  The vacuum at the top of the party could also increase the 
infighting between the Tory Euro-sceptics and pro-Europeans. In 
the wake of the more sceptical line adopted by Mr Major during 
the Euro- elections, with the call for a "multi-speed" EC, his 
choice of chairman will be seen as an indication of the 
direction of the party in the run-up to the next election. 
  In a letter to Mr Major last night, Sir Norman promised he 
would give the "sturdiest possible support" from the 
backbenches. It was a strong signal that he would use his 
influence to prevent any challenge to Mr Major this autumn. 
  Sir Norman singled out party unity as one of the main 
problems he had faced as chairman. Although the Tories lost 14 
Euro-MPs and saw their share of the vote fall to the lowest 
level this century, he said the European elections had shown 
they could fight a ``united and successful campaign, confounding 
predictions. 
  ``In the next two or three years the Conservative Party must 
behave as it did in the last three weeks, not as it did in the 
18 months before that,'' said Sir Norman. 
  Mr Major praised Sir Norman's efforts in streamlining the 
party organisation and putting it back on a sound financial 
footing.

<F P=106> [Report by Tim Coone: "Ulster Agreement Late, Says Spring"] </F>
  [Text] Dublin -- A framework agreement on new 
constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland is unlikely to 
be completed in time for next month's UK-Irish summit, Mr Dick 
Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said yesterday. 
  Talks between the political parties in the province are not 
expected to resume before the autumn because of slow progress by 
the British and Irish governments in drafting the framework 
document, which is intended to provide a focus for the talks. 
  The governments had hoped to publish the document to 
coincide 
with a planned bilateral summit next month, but following a 
meeting of the UK-Irish inter-governmental conference in Dublin 
yesterday, Mr Spring admitted it would be "difficult to meet 
that timetable." 
  Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the 
framework document, which will flesh out the principles 
established in December's Downing Street declaration would not 
be "a blueprint or template" to which the parties would have to 
conform. 
  But he stressed that it would have to address modification 
of 
the Republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland "if it is 
to have any chance of success" in bringing unionists to the 
negotiating table. "It is central to the problem," said Sir 
Patrick. 
  Mr Spring said: "There has to be compromise on both sides, 
by 
both governments." Modification of the territorial claim would 
be in the context of a "balanced accommodation" which would also 
involve modifications to the Government of Ireland Act of 1920. 
  He referred specifically to Section 75 of the act, which 
states: "The supreme authority of the parliament of the United 
Kingdom shall remain unaffected and undiminished over all 
persons and things in (Northern) Ireland and every part thereof." 
  Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has indicated that 
it intends to give its "definitive response" to the Downing 
Street declaration early next month -- but is not now expected 
to recommend an end to the IRA campaign.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Irish Eyes That Fail To Smile"] </F>
  [Text] Tonight at least, and for as long as it lasts, we 
are all Irish. Jack Charlton's football team, the only 
surviving World Cup contender from these islands, has achieved a 
breakthrough in cross-border relations through sport which the 
politicians, meeting again in Dublin yesterday, have been 
painfully unable to emulate. After the latest round of talks, 
Sir Patrick Mayhew -- memo to PM, don't reshuffle this one -- 
said he was "optimistic but not expectant." Come to think of 
it, that's about right for the Italy game, too. 
  Football apart, there is not much to be expectant about on 
the Irish front. The long awaited European elections have been 
and gone. The doomsters were proved wrong. Ian Paisley's 
Democratic Unionists topped the poll and Paisley immediately 
claimed a mandate against Dublin "interference." But he topped 
the poll last time too, and his share of the vote was slightly 
down this week, the only one of the big three candidates to fall 
compared with 1989. In the generally unchanging pattern of 
Northern Irish elections, the new features were John Hume's 
sharply increased vote -- he came within 1,300 votes of pushing 
Paisley into second place -- and the less spectacular hike in 
the Unionist share. With Sinn Fein staying very much where it 
generally is -- at 9.9 per cent in the north, and 3 per cent in 
the Republic -- the election's advance bark was notably worse 
than its actual bite. 
  Contrary to the pessimistic pre-election talk, the Irish 
equation has emerged largely unaltered and, if anything, 
slightly improved. But the surrounding atmosphere of random 
tit-for-tat sectarian killings this week is a reminder that the 
constraints of the grim, dull truth are almost as powerful as 
they have always been. Anyone hoping for a breakthrough when 
Sinn Fein finally deigns to give its reply to the Anglo-Irish 
Declaration early next month is still entitled to look 
tentatively on the bright side; but the probability is now 
overwhelmingly that this will be yet another false dawn for any 
peace process. 
  Sinn Fein's response increasingly seems as if it will not be 
a straight yes or no, not least because Sinn Fein, all the signs 
suggest, remains so divided. The only consistencies in its 
position are the discordant signals which continue to emerge and 
which equally continue to cloud the possibilities of real 
progress. Last month the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, 
talked of the "reality of conflict" as the background against 
which the search for solutions must take place, which was taken 
as meaning that he expected the violence to continue. A few 
days later he listed a further series of demands which could 
help produce his movement's compliance, some of which might be 
negotiable while others might not. 
  But the most fundamental questions of all on this territory 
still have to do with consent. Everything turns in the end on 
whether Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA accept the right of 
the people of Northern Ireland to determine their future. If 
they do accept it, what possible justification can there be for 
continuing violence? If they don't, how can any agreement be 
reached consistent with the repeatedly stated aims of the 
British and Irish governments? 
  Unless or until Sinn Fein can plainly accept consent, not 
coercion, as the basis for unification one day, its manoeuvrings 
over clarification and its programmes of demand are irrelevant 
to the outcome. And though it still doesn't say so directly, 
there seems little chance of it reaching such a conclusion. A 
peace process with Sinn Fein aboard would clearly be much more 
credible than one which excludes it. But the European elections 
showed once again that Sinn Fein's support, North and South, is 
far too thin on the ground for anyone to accept its right to 
dictate what should happen.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The partnership promotion of the 
Russian reforms remains a main goal of German ostpolitik. With 
this guideline, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel concluded the 
first working conference of the German ambassadors to the 12 
successor states of the Soviet Union (CIS) in Bonn on Tuesday 
[21 June]. Speaking to the press, Kinkel, who expressed "some 
shock about the gigantic problems of reconstruction," stressed 
that another urgent goal is the stabilization of Ukraine, which 
is still "the world's third largest nuclear power." In this 
process, making the Chernobyl nuclear power plant -- there are 
another 21 reactors of this type in operation -- safer must be a 
priority. 
  The foreign minister admitted that at the forthcoming 
European summit on Corfu over the weekend, there is once again 
hardly any chance to make the partner states agree to the 
immediate aid program with lasting safety, which has been 
proposed by Germany and France. 
  Regarding East Europe, German policy must also -- in 
addition 
to priority support to the reform processes -- contribute to 
defusing the nationality conflicts, develop markets, and satisfy 
the enormous need for cultural information in the new states. 
With this balance sheet of the ambassadors' conference, Kinkel 
linked a renewed rejection of Russian ideas concerning a new 
European security system, in which NATO is to make itself 
subordinate to CSCE. "For us, NATO remains the absolute 
security anchor," Kinkel stressed.

  [Text] Kiel (DPA) -- Next year German soldiers will go to 
Russia for joint military exercises. In return, in 1996 Russian 
units are to train together with the Bundeswehr in western 
Germany, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, Christian Democratic 
Union, said at the 100th Kiel Week on Saturday [18 June]. 
  "Europe is growing together best when people meet," Ruehe 
said. This also applies to the armed forces. Today Central 
Europe has the opportunity to become the anchor of stability for 
the entire continent. For this purpose, cooperation with Russia 
must be intensified. "Security and peace in Europe can be 
achieved only together with and not against Russia." At the 
same time, the minister announced that he will raise the number 
of reservists to such an extent that 100,000 of them can 
participate in exercises every year.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The European trade unions expect 
decisive stimuli in combatting mass unemployment and in other 
fields of European social politics from Germany's [European] 
Council presidency, to begin on 1 July. In view of double-digit 
unemployment figures, the European Trade Union [ETU] Federation 
delegation's talk with FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl focused on 
employment policies, Austrian ETU President Friedrich 
Verzetnitsch later told journalists in Bonn. 
  The implementation of the proposals on combating 
unemployment 
that are contained in Commission President Jacques Delors' white 
paper will also increase employees' preparedness to deal with 
Europe, Verzetnitsch said. According to Government Spokesman 
Dieter Vogel, Kohl also affirmed that the planned guidelines for 
the establishment of European works councils, part-time work, 
and limited employment are a major priority for Bonn. 
  ETU Secretary General Emilio Gabaglio; Dieter Schulte, newly 
elected chairman of the German Trade Union Federation (DGB); 
Roland Issen, chief of the German Salaried Employees Union 
(DAG); and FRG Labor Minister Norbert Bluem (Christian 
Democratic Union) also participated in the discussion. The 
European Union unionists's visit to Kohl, planned a long time 
ago, took place on Schulte's first working day in his new 
office. Because of the traditional character of this meeting 
before the takeover of the Council presidency, which changes 
every six months, Schulte said he did not assess his visit to 
the chancellor's office as his first formal visit there.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has called 
on Germans to engage in "active patriotism." "Just as freedom 
and love for one's fatherland belong together, in the future 
patriotism and commitment to Europe must supplement each other," 
Kohl said in Munich on Sunday [19 June] when he accepted the 
1994 Konrad Adenauer Freedom Prize. "Anyone who fans hatred 
against foreigners can never claim that he is a good patriot," 
the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] chairman added. 
  Kohl received the award of the conservative "Germany 
Foundation" during a festive event in the Bavarian Minister 
President's office in Munich. "We need a new civic sense, 
active patriotism for which we remember virtues such as courage 
and reliability, industriousness and one's own responsibility, 
love for one's fellow-man and helpfulness," Kohl said. 
  Patriotism must not be degraded with the insinuation that 
the 
borders between national pride and nationalism are blurring. 
"Let us also resist the temptation to despise patriotism just 
because this virtue got a bad reputation during the Nazi period 
and was abused at that time," the chancellor stated. 
  In determining Germany's position so-to-speak, he 
emphatically opposed a loosening of the FRG's ties with the West 
after reunification. In view of the security policy challenges 
of the future, it is in Germany's interest to continue the 
policy of having ties with the West and of foreign policy 
integration. Kohl rejects a special German role also concerning 
future Bundeswehr missions to preserve and reestablish peace: 
"A people that is no longer willing to cooperate with its 
partners for peace and freedom has morally resigned from the 
world." 
  According to the Foundation, Kohl received the Adenauer 
Freedom Prize for his life's work in the service of freedom, 
peace, and the unity of the German people in Konrad Adenauer's 
spirit. The award was presented to him by Max Adenauer, the son 
of the first German chancellor. Bavarian Minister President 
Edmund Stoiber, CDU, said in a greeting address that with his 
policy Kohl has found the answer to the greatest question of the 
German people in 200 years, "the answer to the question about 
unity and freedom."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federation of German Chambers of 
Industry and Commerce [DIHT] has called on the Federal 
Government to urge the European Union [EU] to be less wasteful. 
"The time for making excessive demands is over," the DIHT 
stated on Monday [20 June] in Bonn. "What we now need are 
consistent planning of tasks, an economic budget policy, and 
efficient spending control. This must go hand in hand with the 
strengthening of the market forces and of competition in 
Europe." Centralism and overregulation must be counteracted. 
  From the German EU presidency -- from 1 July to 31 December 
1994 -- the DIHT expects a stronger coordination of the economic 
and financial policy of the EU member states and clearer 
prospects for the Central and East European reformist states. 
"After the accession of Austria and the Scandinavian countries, 
the community needs some respite," the DIHT stated. 
  Nevertheless, the reformist states need a concrete long-term 
perspective for the time up to their accession to the EU. They 
must be granted room to adapt to competition and the level of 
integration in the EU. Excessive hopes regarding the time of 
accession have to be avoided. The most promising help is the 
opening of the markets. "Free trade will make it easier for the 
reformist states to make the necessary changes of their 
production structures, promote privatization, thus supporting 
the introduction of the market economy system," the DIHT argued. 
  It must be prevented, under all circumstances, that the 
convergence criteria, which were agreed for the third stage of 
European monetary union, are watered down. The stability of the 
monetary value must not be put at risk. "Quality is more 
important than sticking to the calendar," the DIHT said with 
reference to the set date for monetary union, 1999. 
  Moreover, the DIHT called on the Federal Government to fight 
for the speedy elimination of the transitional solution 
regarding the value-added tax [VAT]. The transition from the 
principle of country of destination to that of country of origin 
would be a sign for a real European single market. For the 
economy it is important to treat deliveries to other EU 
countries in the same way as domestic transactions as far as 
taxes are concerned. For the consumers there would be no 
changes, because since the beginning of 1993 they have always 
had to pay VAT rate of the EU country in which they bought and 
can no longer claim any possible difference to the lower German 
VAT at the border.

  [Text] Bonn, June 17 (CTK) -- The Visegrad Four countries 
(the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland) have set on 
the best way to democracy and market economy, SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany] Chairman Rudolf Scharping told 
today an SPD conference devoted to Western assistance to the 
reform-minded states. 
  Scharping espoused President Vaclav Havel's statement that 
these states should not be considered post-communist states any 
longer and spoke in favor of their fastest possible joining the 
European Union [EU]. 
  It is important for Germany to establish a dense network of 
contacts with the Eastern states and not to be confined only to 
official political contacts, Scharping stressed. In connection 
with this he criticized Helmut Kohl's cabinet and other Western 
countries for their reluctant assistance to Central and East 
European countries. 
  Scharping also criticized Kohl's cabinet for the way in 
which 
it was coming to terms with the compensation to the Nazi victims 
in the Czech Republic and Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia 
after World War Two. Havel's proposal to settle these issues 
was "very generous," while Bonn "set it aside," Scharping said. 
  Scharping did not mention what proposal he had in mind. He 
was probably referring to Havel's 1991 initiative which wanted 
to grant Czechoslovak citizenship to Sudeten Germans, provided 
they drop their property claims in their former homeland and 
that Bonn acknowledges that the 1938 Munich accord was not valid 
since the very beginning, and to Havel's later proposals to 
compensate the Czech victims persecuted by the Nazi regime. 
  The Federal Government has never responded to the proposal, 
Scharping stated. The unresolved problems in bilateral 
relations are "the hotbed of new nationalism." "Nationalism is 
something we need the least in Europe," he added. 
  SPD deputy Gernot Erler stressed that Germany had to strive 
to eliminate the West's protectionist trade measures towards the 
reform-minded countries. 
  He rejected the claim that given the present economic slump, 
East European exports would threaten Western economic 
development. The 1992 East European exports to the EU countries 
made up only 4 percent of the total volume, which was about the 
same as Norway's share, Erler reported.

  [Excerpt] Lampertheim -- The Social Democratic Party of 
Germany's [SPD] deputy chairwoman, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul has 
spoken out for a red-green coalition. A shift in power cannot 
be achieved "with the parties that are responsible for the 
desperate situation in Germany: Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union, and Free Democratic Party," she 
told the SPD Hesse South party conference at Lampertheim on 
Friday [17 June]. As far as the Bundestag election campaign is 
concerned, the Social Democrats must quickly draw the 
conclusions from their defeat at the European election, 
Wieczoerek-Zeul said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Guenter Verheugen, the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany's [SPD] federal manager, has called on [SPD Chairman] 
Rudolf Scharping to present his shadow cabinet before late 
August. This is the only way to "reply to the Kohl model" and to 
"show that the SPD has a wealth of assertive politicians." 
  Verheugen said it is tactically unwise to demand that the 
SPD 
make a clear coalition statement. At the same time he pointed 
out that "the idea of a grand coalition must not even come up." 
He indirectly favored a coalition with the Greens. The party 
must be self-confident in choosing its partners. For its policy 
of renewal it needs a reform alliance, Verheugen said.

  [Text] Weimar (DPA) -- In the opinion of Christian Social 
Union [CSU] Chairman Theo Waigel, the Party of Democratic 
Socialism [PDS] has to be combated with the same determination 
as the extreme-right Republikaner. One cannot isolate Franz 
Schoenhuber as chairman of the Republikaner if other standards 
are applied to the PDS, Waigel said at the beginning of the 
annual conference of the chairmen of the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU]/CSU Bundestag Group in Weimar on Monday [20 June]. 
  On 12 June, the successor party of the Socialist Unity Party 
of Germany established itself as the third political power in 
the new laender and gained between 15 and above 20 percent of 
the votes. Waigel now calls for an increased confrontation with 
the parties on the left and the right fringe. 
  The FRG finance minister assessed as a good sign the fact 
that, for the first time, the new laender's need for transfer 
payments will not further increase next year. In the first 
quarter of this year, a growth rate of 10 percent was achieved 
in eastern Germany. It still cannot be said how long the 
recovery process will take. However, the upswing has obviously 
begun, he said.

  [Text] Bonn -- The Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] 
rejects the introduction of a "voluntary police reserve" and 
broader use of the Bundeswehr at home. Corresponding proposals 
by the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union 
[CDU/CSU] would water down the current division of tasks, FDP 
Secretary General Hoyer told journalists in Bonn today. It is 
necessary to fill the 30,000 vacant positions among the police 
and not opt for "superficial solutions that might turn out to be 
dangerous." 
  After a meeting of the FDP Presidium, Hoyer stressed that 
the 
Liberals are against a "spare-time police," as suggested by 
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (CDU). The current division 
of the monopoly of power must be maintained, according to which 
internal threats must be fought by the police and external 
threats by the Bundeswehr. "Internal security is too important. 
Thus, the citizens must not be put off with makeshift 
solutions," Hoyer pointed out.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- In the view of the 
Bundesbank, the evident recovery of international trade is now 
also pulling the Germany economy out of an economic low. "In 
the past few months, the west German economy seems to have 
overcome recession, and signs for sustained economic recovery 
are increasing," the Bundesbank writes in its recent monthly 
report. "In the weakest area of the economy -- the 
manufacturing industry -- the situation has improved lately." 
  In the Bundesbank's view, the "harbingers of lasting 
economic 
recovery" have come mainly from foreign markets, whose 
stagnation was "one of the primary reasons for the recession." 
Starting in North America and Southeast Asia, impulses have 
spread to "a wide range of countries." "German exporters are 
obviously able to participate in the resulting acceleration of 
growth in world trade." Should export demands further rise, 
negative effects at home -- such as a drop in real income, 
rising taxes and rates -- would be more than set off. 
  So far, the Bundesbank had assessed the prospects for the 
economy very cautiously. In its recent monthly report it now 
speaks of a "remarkable turn for the better," which, however, 
does not yet promise a change in the job market trend. The 
Bundesbank's national economy experts point out that, following 
the major slump, the west German economy was still at a very low 
level. "With regard to capacity utilization, we are now at the 
1988 level, that is to say the period before German 
unification," and economic growth expected for 1994 is not 
sufficient "to prevent a further limited increase in 
unemployment." In eastern Germany upward development has 
clearly continued in the Bundesbank's view. "More and more 
enterprises are recovering shares in the east German market that 
they had temporarily lost, and are establishing themselves in 
western Germany," the monthly reports notes. "Successes on the 
domestic market are the first signs of increasing competitive 
strength for east German products following the restructuring of 
enterprises." The economy in the new laender, however, will 
require a lot more time in the search for new markets abroad. 
  The Bundesbank argues that, in the long run, competitiveness 
and new jobs cannot be achieved with a one-time effort. "This 
will require a rather longer process, which also includes, not 
least, reduction of the tax and rate burden for enterprises." 
According to Bundesbank estimates, in 1995, the rate quota 
--taxes and social insurance contributions together -- will 
reach 45 percent of the GDP, compared to 40.5 percent in 1990, 
the tax reform year.

  [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- In the view of Dieter Spoeri 
(Social Democratic Party of Germany), chairman of the economic 
ministers' conference, the Bundesbank is endangering Germany's 
economic recovery with its unclear monetary policy. In an 
interview with DPA in Stuttgart on Sunday [19 June] the 
Baden-Wuerttemberg economics minister said that the 
international financial markets are, on the whole, on a 
dangerous "crash course." "The visible sign of that is the 
dramatic increase in the capital market interests, which have 
gone up by more than 1.5 percentage points since the beginning 
of the year. This once again destroys the recovery of the 
development of investments, which had become visible over the 
past few months." 
  In Spoeri's view, the clear line of the Bundesbank has been 
completely lost. For some time now periods of excessively long 
intervals between reductions of the interest rates have been 
alternating with inexplicably high reductions of the interest 
rates, such as in May. This has eliminated the leeway for a 
constant policy of interest rate reduction for months. 
  Furthermore, the rigid fixation of the Bundesbank on the 
short-term development of the money supply is absolutely 
counterproductive for stability policy, the minister noted. The 
excessive expansion of the money supply has been caused by the 
Bundesbank itself. In addition, by dramatizing the development 
of the money supply the Bundesbank is fanning fear of inflation 
on the part of the actors on the financial markets, a fear that 
is actually unjustified in Germany at the moment. 
  Spoeri says that for him it is still a secret how the 
Bundesbank wants to persuade the partners to the wage 
negotiations to come to wage contracts for 1995, too, which are 
compatible with stability, if it acts in this way. As a result 
of contradictory statements by leading Bundesbank members 
regarding further leeway for the reduction of the interest 
rates, Spoeri thinks that "not even the direction of monetary 
policy in Germany can be seen clearly anymore." 
  He appealed to the Bundesbank to prevent a "crash scenario" 
on the financial markets by returning to the criteria of 
constancy and predictability in the indispensable policy of 
reducing interest rates.

<F P=106> [Article by Michel Colomes: "Culpable Leniency"] </F>
  [Text] For one Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) smuggler 
arrested on the Autoroute de l'Est, how many explosives, machine 
guns, even rocket launchers will have transited unencumbered 
through the sieve-like borders of Europe in the direction of 
Algeria? How many went to fatten the arsenal of those who hide 
their weapons under the tunics of the fundamentalists? Our 
neighbors' negligence, our European partners' indifference, and 
our American allies' lack of understanding are increasingly 
becoming a matter of concern and irritation for French foreign 
policy , favoring the goals of the fundamentalists as they do. 
  Of course, France is the country most concerned with the 
tragic fate awaiting Algeria if nothing is done to stop the 
decay of its civil institutions. Also, it is easy to understand 
how, for the French prime minister, Algeria has become "one of 
the most serious worries." But how can the other countries of 
the Mediterranean be spared by the earthquake that the arrival 
in power of the fundamentalists in Algiers would mean? How could 
the fundamentalist wave have no repercussions on those European 
countries which, like ours, shelter immigrant Muslim 
communities? Finally, how is it possible not to see that the 
stability of the Maghreb--and probably beyond it--would be 
affected, and that the groundswell would certainly not spare 
moderate Arab countries? 
  And yet, Madrid and Rome continue to grant visas without 
discernment to Algerian citizens whom the strong permeability of 
borders subsequently allows to go wherever they wish--and 
therefore to France. 
  Without wishing to dramatize the situation, Paris notes that 
one of the FIS leaders, Rabah Kebir, continues his militant 
action in Germany. And that another FIS official, certainly more 
virulent and dangerous, Anouar Haddam, enjoys freedom of action 
and expression in the United States, to the point that from 
Chicago, he can send his propaganda to French newspapers. 
  Finally, even if on 18 April the European Union did make 
available the Community assistance that Paris wished to give 
Algeria, the Americans, through the Eximbank, are doing 
everything in their power to complicate long-term credits needed 
by the Algerian Government. 
  The attitude of the United States, which has reopened a 
dialogue with the fundamenalists, was actually--together with 
Bosnia--one of the reasons for Foreign Minister Alain Juppe's 
recent visit to Washington. The minister's message went 
something like this: "Neither you nor we have any reason to show 
leniency to people who hate us." 
  It is not certain that it will be heard. First, because from 
Saigon to Tehran, and now in Algiers, the Americans are 
resolutely pursuing the utopian idea of the "third force," that 
of the so-called reasonable revoutionaries with whom it is 
possible to talk. With well-known results... Secondly, and more 
importantly, because on the other side of the Atlantic, the 
unavowed feeling that since the Algerian war France has 
continued to have unhealthy ulterior motives vis-a-vis its 
former colonies still lingers. To sum up, the Americans are 
allegedly cultivating Algerian fundamentalists to counterbalance 
the stench of French colonialism. Diplomatic communication is 
decidedly a difficult art.

<F P=106> [Report by Gianfranco Simone: "Incisa di Camerana: `We Await </F>
Orders From Government; 200 of Our Paratroopers Ready To Leave'"] 
  [Text] Milan -- "Last Thursday [16 June] I was in the 
training area at Ampugnano in Tuscany for an exercise involving 
some 200 paratroopers from the Folgore Regiment, organized by 
General Loi. I left there at 1800. An hour later, Chief of 
Defense Staff Admiral Venturoni issued orders to keep 200 
paratroopers on a state of alert with a view to sending them out 
to Rwanda." This was said by Gen. Bonifazio Incisa di Camerana, 
Army chief of staff, during an official visit to the 3d Army 
Corps command in Milan. 
  "We have been training troops for interventions abroad for 
some time. For Bosnia, we trained the Garibaldi Brigade of 
Caserta -- 3,000 troops, mostly volunteers on extended service. 
A few hundred will be enough for Rwanda, since we have been 
talking about a joint action with the French and the Belgians." 
  It seems that the present preference is for a UN 
intervention, however, because the French are not well regarded 
by the Tutsi ethnic group, who are threatening to shoot them the 
moment they land. So our troops would suffer too. Have the 
orders changed? 
  "We are soldiers, and we go wherever and with whomever the 
government orders us; we simply obey orders. It is not my job 
to concern myself with politics. I must, rather, consider 
technical problems, logistics, which are complicated by the fact 
that Rwanda is not on the sea, unlike Somalia, so we could only 
use air transportation. So to supply such an effort with the 
few C-130's and G.222's that we have would cause us major 
difficulties." 
  These anxieties are well founded. The 46th Air Transport 
Brigade has 12 four-engined C-130 Hercules aircraft and 38 
twin-engined G-222's, with a potential freight capacity of 20 
tonnes and 9 tonnes, respectively. So the problem concerns not 
manpower -- a Hercules could carry up to 92 men and a G-222 up 
to 53 -- but supplies: from vehicles to water. Furthermore, 
the actual availability of usable aircraft is around 50 percent. 
Further limitations are imposed by routine tasks in Italy, 
exacerbated at present by firefighting activities.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "PLO To Open Office for Relations </F>
With Holy See"] 
  [Excerpt] Vatican City, June 18 -- The Palestine Liberation 
Organization is preparing to open an office for relations with 
the Vatican "in a matter of weeks," Nimr Hammad, the Palestinian 
general delegate in Italy confirmed today. 
  Hammad said Vatican and Palestinian officials are now 
"discussing the test of an agreement for mutual recognition" in 
a statement given to the Italian news agency ANSA. The opening 
of a Palestinian office for relations with the Holy See would 
appear to sanction the start-up of official relations between 
the two sides. 
  On this score, Palestinian sources here have recently 
referred to the prospect for imminent "diplomatic relations." 
The feasibility of this step, however, is clouded by what the 
Vatican itself describes as "the beginning of Palestinian 
autonomous government responsibility in the Gaza region and the 
city of Jerico," in relation to full diplomatic recognition, 
with an exchange of ambassadors, with an entity which is not yet 
a full-blow state. 
  In any case, noted Vatican watchers, a Palestinian 
"presence" 
in the Vatican would certainly come as a step in this direction 
and help confirm the desire of the Holy See to play a role in 
the Middle East peace process. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Vatican/PLO: Talks on Diplomatic </F>
Representation Going Well"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 20 -- Talks between the Vatican 
and the Palestine Liberation Organisation on the opening of a 
PLO mission accredited to the Holy See are going "well," the 
PLO's diplomatic representative in Italy Nimr Hammad said here 
today. 
  According to Hammad, the negotiations could be complete and 
the first Palestinian representative appointed "within a month." 
Currently, the PLO has no representative at the Vatican City, 
but Hammad, who is accredited with the rank of delegate-general 
in Italy, is responsible for formal relations. 
  Chatting with reporters on the fringe of a conference of 
Palestinian and Israeli scientists and researchers organised by 
the Italian National Research Council, both Hammad and Israeli 
Ambassador in Rome Avi Pazner voiced optimism over the future of 
the Middle Eastern peace process. 
  Pazner confirmed that negotiations will start shortly on 
extending Palestinian autonomy from Gaza and Jericho to other 
Israeli-controlled areas. "But Jerusalem is not on the agenda 
and will never be divided," he said, as he reported that the 
autonomy process was going better than expected. 
  The Mideastern peace process and the progress towards 
Palestinian autonomy had produced "very fine" results, said the 
diplomat, adding that the events of recent months represent a 
"revolution" for the region. 
  He was also asked about the Israeli attitude to the presence 
in the Berlusconi government of hard-right ministers and deputy 
ministers from the National Alliance, whose roots lie in the 
neo-fascist Italian Social Movement. "We'll judge by the facts, 
what they do and say, not what others say about them," replied 
the diplomat, repeating the position taken by Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres when he met his Italian confrere Antonio Martino 
in Luxembourg on June 13. 
  The opening of the conference was also attended by President 
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Pagliarini on Company Tax System: </F>
`Change or Leave European Union'"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Fiuggi, near Rome, June 18 -- Budget Minister 
Giancarlo Pagliarini suggested Italy bow to European Union [EU] 
demands on company tax arrangements or leave the Twelve, in a 
speech to an industrialists' gathering here on Saturday [18 
June]. 
  If, the minister told the meeting, Italy does not wish to 
change its current system under which companies can detract part 
of sums paid for employees' national insurance and health system 
contributions from taxes, "then let's get out of the EU, but 
this means losing thirty trillion lire" (18.7 billion dollars). 
  The EU has begun proceedings against Italy to force it to 
change this tax arrangement, which amounts to a form of state 
subsidy for trade and industry. Under new regulations, 
countries accused of infringing EU rules are not given sums owed 
to them through EU schemes. Italy is owed 30 trillion lire in 
funding for depressed areas. 
  Pagliarini yesterday met with EU Regional Policy 
Commissioner 
Bruce Millan who confirmed that Italy stood to lose the sum, 
which comes within the framework of the 1994-99 support fund. 
  Italy is also set to lose one trillion lire (625 million 
dollars) in EU money if it cannot come up with figures on 
pre-1988 funding for the poorer southern Mezzogiorno area by 
March 31 1995, Millan told Pagliarini. 
  "I know it is difficult to believe this," the minister told 
today's meeting, "but no one knows anything about these figures. 
Perhaps town councils used the funds to pay their traffic 
wardens."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Gnutti Satisfied With Revised Steel </F>
Plan"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 16 -- Industry Minister Vito 
Gnutti on Thursday [16 June] said he was "fairly satisfied" with 
the conditions set by the European Commission for the approval 
of a revised restructuring plan for the steel industry. 
  "We must still define some points," Gnutti said after 
meeting 
the European competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, adding: 
"There are no particular problems, it's a question of setting 
times" for application of the agreement. 
  The European Commission yesterday came up with a new plan 
allowing the Italian government to give steel companies 415 
million ECUs (493.5 million dollars) to finance production 
cutbacks through plant closings. Gnutti said his talks with Van 
Miert were going very well and that the Rome government may 
approve the plan and set aside the funds at tomorrow's cabinet 
meeting. 
  The plan, which was declared all but dead last month, would 
have Italy to reduce its production by some five to six million 
[metric] tons, allowing the EU [European Union] to near its goal 
of reducing overall capacity production by 19 million tons. 
The plan will have to be approved by EU industry ministers who 
will meet in Brussels next Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi by Paolo </F>
Guzzanti and unidentified journalists in Rome; date not given: 
"People Want Us To Govern"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [introductory passage omitted] [LA 
STAMPA] Prime Minister, what comment do you have to make on this 
defeat for the government in an episode [escape of mafia leader] 
in which organized crime defied the state? 
  [Berlusconi] I will tell you right away: The government 
acted immediately to gather all the information it needs to 
judge what happened and to report to Parliament. So much for 
the immediate, technical level. But I perceive a certain 
tendency toward the old game of buck passing and of artificial 
polemics. I will tell you equally frankly that these are 
matters that do not concern us and to which we, as a government, 
refuse to attach any importance. 
  [LA STAMPA] But the impact on public opinion does have an 
undeniable influence, and you will agree that this influence is 
important. 
  [Berlusconi] That is very true. Indeed, I would like to tell 
the public that, while we are not concerned with polemics, 
results for the benefit of the community are this government's 
prime objective. So I will say that dragnet of the 'Ndrangheta 
in the North is a specific fact and provides reassurance about 
the law and order forces' capacity to act, which is something 
about which I have no doubts, moreover. 
  [LA STAMPA] Not even after such a brazen act? 
  [Berlusconi] The fact is that there are a couple of things 
that need to be analyzed and understood properly, 
dispassionately. We must discover how it is possible for 
someone who turned state's evidence to go walkabout, as happened 
with Santino Di Matteo, and also how it is possible for a 
commando of experts to arm themselves and to draw up such a 
skilful plan to enter a prison and achieve their purpose. 
  [LA STAMPA] These are the very questions that everyone is 
asking.... 
  [Berlusconi] I can assure you that my government wants to 
secure precise answers and to act accordingly. This is our 
method. 
  [LA STAMPA] Prime Minister, you have nurtured your image as 
a 
winner, and you have won in the European elections too. But it 
seemed more like a plebiscite than a victory. Of course you are 
pleased. But can you also see the overwhelming nature of the 
Forza Italia phenomenon? 
  [Berlusconi] Plebiscite? Pardon me, but your question rests 
entirely on this word, which suggests inappropriate parallels. 
There was no plebiscite here; people were not asked to vote 
"yes" or "no." If I may say so, it was a much broader choice, 
because it was in fact carried out in accordance with the old 
method, the proportional one. 
  [LA STAMPA] Very well, not a plebiscite, but a massive shift 
in the vote. Did you expect it? 
  [Berlusconi] I am reassured by the fact that, with the 
proportional system, the government commands the support of the 
absolute majority of voters. So above all, it was a political 
victory for the government. Did I expect it? No, frankly, I 
did not expect it. 
  [LA STAMPA] What do you think was the reason for it? People 
experience great crushes and tend to throng round a leader.... 
  [Berlusconi] No, I do not think so. I am very thoroughly 
acquainted with the voters' wishes and aspirations. They acted 
clearly, with a very acute political awareness. They saw that 
there is a government, they have witnessed some pigeon shooting 
which could turn into obstacles to the government, and issued a 
vote which means: We want the government to govern. Pigeon 
shooting is a disappointing sport; it does not fire people's 
enthusiasm. 
  [LA STAMPA] Your answer prompts me to ask right away whether 
the clarification that you requested from [League Secretary] 
Bossi will be a sharp one. But first I would like to know why 
progovernment voters rewarded your movement in particular. 
  [Berlusconi] I think the basic factor is an investment of 
confidence in us, a placing of trust which is not at all 
unconditional. I think that people like calm but still resolute 
language. A style of government which consists of producing 
achievements. Our declaration of war on all that is tangled, 
devious, and complex, and our ability to conduct this operation 
of simplification without in the least impoverishing the 
significance of the social battle. You see, I am convinced that 
Forza Italia succeeded in communicating this attitude 
successfully, and it is partly because of these characteristics 
that it was not established as a party but takes the form of a 
government class, the promise of a government of the 
institutions. The Italian people are very well aware that this 
is a strong and credible proposal, after the period of the 
parties' invasion of the apparatuses. And that is the reason 
for the vote and for its dimension. 
  [LA STAMPA] You are either very clever or very modest to 
talk always about a collective and reassuring plurality. But if 
it was not a plebiscite, let us say that it was a referendum, 
and that you personally were the subject of that referendum... 
  [Berlusconi] Pardon me, but if it was not a plebiscite, I 
must tell you that it was not a referendum either. Would you 
like me to conceal the fact that I am pleased? Of course, I am 
pleased with my results. I was a candidate, and people voted 
for me generously, for which I am grateful to the voters, but 
this success has nothing to do with any referendum. Decisions 
about a single individual happen when the voters grant their 
support directly to the prime minister. If and when this happens 
in Italy, it will be possible to talk in terms of a personal 
result. Sunday [12 June] was a reward for a leadership and a 
program. As for my personal responsibility, I am fully aware of 
it. 
  [LA STAMPA] Since they were European elections, here is a 
European question: Where will you sit in that Parliament? With 
the Liberals, as [Foreign] Minister Martino would like, or with 
the popular group, as you say you would prefer? 
  [Berlusconi] Giscard d'Estaing -- and nobody could deny that 
he is both a liberal and a democrat -- has joined the European 
People's Group. God willing, there are no barriers in 
Strasbourg, or they are less rigid, less bound to ideological 
roots. I believe that Italian liberalism is historically fragile 
because it did not come together with liberal Catholicism. As 
you are well aware, if Sturzo and Giolitti had come together, 
our country would have been spared splits which proved to be of 
the most lamentable kind. Be that as it may, the Forza Italia 
movement has deep roots in the Catholic world, which I 
personally intend to cultivate -- an increasingly open world, 
often comprising different languages and cultures, a world in 
which major problems of our time are clearly perceived -- issues 
so close to [Pope] John Paul II's heart, such as the family, the 
imbalance between wealthy countries and poor countries, and a 
freedom that can be true to itself without losing contact with 
human and social solidarity. 
  [LA STAMPA] In other words, you will join the popular group 
in Strasbourg. What about in Italy? Let us discuss the current 
feelings that prevail between you and the League or, rather, 
Bossi. For instance, in Milan your movement has swept away the 
League. How do you explain this reversal? 
  [Berlusconi] I explain it by the fact that the inhabitants 
of 
Lombardy and Milan have been searching for years for someone who 
can represent their problems in the spirit of their own 
feelings, traditions, and history. And at times they have done 
so in an excited manner. Now I think they decided to reward 
values that are closer to their own approach -- an attitude of 
calmness, seriousness, rigorousness, sobriety, which is 
characteristic of the people of Lombardy, as well as us. And we 
are also accustomed to entirely rejecting rough brawls. I think 
this is the explanation. 
  [LA STAMPA] Your answer was very calm and balanced, but the 
result was basically a sharp defeat for Bossi by Berlusconi. 
You are devouring the League's representatives one by one. I 
would like to ask you whether you intend to occupy their 
political space too. 
  [Berlusconi] Listen, nobody is devouring anyone here. I do 
not devour anyone, and it is enough to consider the National 
Alliance's result to realize that. Of course, I was struck by 
the citizen who greeted me and said, now you are worth a Bossi 
and a half, referring to the results. But these are mere 
anecdotes. I have no resentment toward Umberto Bossi, who is 
still railing every day against "that fellow there," though he 
never explains who it is. So I merely hope that he manages to 
evade the temptation of neurosis, instability, and 
self-consumption. 
  [LA STAMPA] Prime Minister, would try to answer me honestly: 
Are you urging the League to replace Bossi? 
  [Berlusconi] I do not concern myself with other people's 
leaders. This too is my custom, my style. [Democratic Party of 
the Left, PDS, Secretary] Mr. Occhetto publicly acknowledged 
this, when he thanked me the day he resigned. 
  [LA STAMPA] Let us consider it from another angle: As early 
as last Sunday you mentioned the possibility of another 
election. Is this not a threat to the League? 
  [Berlusconi] Look, it is the chief of state who decides on 
elections, while a coalition's future is determined by its 
progress. Obviously the European elections prompt us to proceed 
even more vigorously. And now we must see whether or not we are 
obstructed. By obstructions, of course, I am referring not to 
the exercise of the opposition's rights, but to filibustering. 
We shall see what happens, and we will draw the necessary 
conclusions on that basis. 
  [LA STAMPA] Are you surprised by the PPI's [Italian Popular 
Party] result? Do you expect it to disappear? 
  [Berlusconi] On the contrary. I wish the PPI a recovery of 
its support and of its political role -- but in the right 
direction: the government of society, within a moderate center 
political area, with a liberal program. I am working to this 
end, legitimately, within respect for their autonomous analysis. 
I believe that a coming together is inevitable, without winners 
or losers. 
  [LA STAMPA] What do you think the PPI should do now? Are you 
in favor of its splitting? To which individuals and what 
environment do you feel closest? And what line should that 
party officially adopt? 
  [Berlusconi] I will not dictate other parties' lines, nor 
will I choose my favorite friends. I will confine myself to 
expressing an opinion, which is this: The first-past-the-post 
system makes desirable, and perhaps inevitable, a polarization 
-- not forcible, but free and deliberate, within the Catholic 
world too. In other words, I neither want nor foresee a split, 
but I do believe it senseless for a Catholic who sees things the 
same way as a left-wing opposition to remain in a forcible union 
with a Catholic who inclines more toward the values and programs 
of the government area which I believe I represent. 
  [LA STAMPA] Is it true that, as [National Alliance, AN, 
leader] Fini said, Forza Italia and the AN could establish a 
single movement in the near future? 
  [Berlusconi] With the AN, the Center Union, the Christian 
Democrats, and the Reformers, we must work within the context of 
a coalition political cartel, the context of the pole for 
freedoms and good government which prevailed in the general 
election and gave the country a government. Very loyal 
cooperation is under way with the AN and Fini within this 
context. 
  [LA STAMPA] [Former President] Cossiga has urged you to 
initiate a number of constitutional reforms. Do you agree? 
Could you indicate the principal ones? 
  [Berlusconi] The new electoral law, which has worked despite 
its obvious imperfections, is the nucleus for any future 
constitutional reform. The ideas about federalism and 
presidentialism that people have been talking about for years 
make sense now only if we make both the letter and the spirit of 
the first-past-the-post system effective -- the direct choice of 
those who govern and supervisory powers for the opposition 
forces, who will plan an alternative. This is the democracy of 
rotation to which the country aspires, and which is now taking 
its first steps. 
  [LA STAMPA] After the victory in the European elections, 
will 
the desire for a reckoning which was apparent within the ranks 
of the majority increase, or do you intend to control it? 
  [Berlusconi] There is no such desire. To govern means to 
have the instruments to intervene effectively in the fields of 
the economy, security, public order, and foreign policy. 
Efficiently and discreetly, since I am talking sincerely about 
a liberal government. What does any reckoning have to do with 
this? These are tribal concerns, which are alien to us. 
  [LA STAMPA] More specifically, will the offensive against 
RAI 
[state broadcasting corporation] and the press (which you too 
accuse of having failed to support you) continue? 
  [Berlusconi] I know of only one RAI offensive -- that on the 
part of RAI itself against a balanced budget and rational 
management. Its new management board has made some effort to 
remedy a situation of great indebtedness. But I wonder whether 
it is enough. We will disentangle the knots with a sense of 
balance. As for the newspapers, I have no issue with them; on 
the contrary. I confine myself to the normal dialogue that a 
democratic politician builds with whoever criticizes him 
legitimately. Sometimes you have the right to reply, do you not? 
  [LA STAMPA] How do you envisage the future of Forza Italia? 
  [Berlusconi] A splendid future, with a movement of opinion 
that will shape attitudes, engage in political organization, and 
forge links with its elected representatives and the country in 
order to build the right kind of social establishment within the 
institutions, instead of an apparatus, a filter, or a dividing 
wall between institutions and society. 
  [LA STAMPA] What do you think of Occhetto, who thanked you 
on 
the day he resigned? Who do you hope will become PDS secretary? 
  [Berlusconi] I have said several times that Mr. Occhetto is 
a 
very likable person. His resignation was a well-balanced and 
politically correct gesture, which I will leave it to the 
members and leaders of his party to judge. I have no favorite 
candidates within the PDS. I neither sanctify nor diabolize any 
of my adversaries, and still hope that they will treat me and my 
allies in the same way.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Previti Urges Attention for Defence </F>
Issues"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Civitavecchia, north of Rome, June 16 -- 
Italy's major role in the Atlantic Alliance, European defence 
cooperation, and Mediterranean stability, not to mention 
international peace-keeping missions, should be matched by 
closer attention for defence issues in the government and 
parliament, Italian Defence Minister Cesare Previti said here 
today. 
  Closing the academic year at the War School in this coastal 
town north of Rome, he said planned armed forces reform should 
be followed quickly by the financial decisions needed to put 
them into effect. Two draft bills are currently pending before 
parliament to reform the armed forces' legislative framework and 
organisation, above all, by creating more streamlined command 
structures and admitting greater reliance on volunteers. 
  "More quality and less quantity makes sense if you make new 
investments as well as making cuts," said Previti, "but if you 
just cut, the result is simple reductions which, in the long 
term, are harmful." 
  In his first meeting with the army's top echelons, Previti, 
whose expertise in the defence field derives in part from a 
stint as a top executive at Alenia, the public-sector aerospace 
and defence contractor, urged the government to make adequate 
investments to give "new impetus to the indispensable process of 
renewal and modernisation" in the armed forces. "Without this," 
he pointed out, "it makes no practical sense to talk about a new 
defence model and role for Italy on the international scene so 
that it can make its due contribution to peace and security." 
  He also told his audience that increasingly frequent 
international security commitments had been a great drain on 
defence funds as well as accelerating the wear and tear on 
equipment. 
  Previti also said he would be working for a mix of national 
servicemen and volunteers, even if the armed forces are reduced 
in size as planned. He added that the draft could only be 
shortened substantially if sufficient national servicemen serve 
the draft and investments for the armed forces' qualitative 
growth materialise.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Martino Sees Greater Role for </F>
Cultural Policy"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 15 -- Italian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Martino said here today that he sees a greater role for 
cultural affairs in Italian foreign policy. 
  Addressing a session of the National Committee for the 
Promotion of Italian Culture Abroad at the Foreign Ministry, he 
said the new policy would strive to give greater stress to 
interactions between science, technology, economics, political 
science and culture. 
  According to Martino, in this perspective, the promotion of 
culture would be an important factor in lending credibility to 
Italian activity on the international stage. 
  He also said this would mean giving the Foreign Ministry the 
appropriate tools and means for achieving the target in which he 
said he expects the committee to produce concrete and 
appropriate proposals in the very near future.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Price Tag of 18.75 Billion Dollars </F>
on Court Ruling"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 13 -- A ruling handed down by the 
Constitutional Court last week on minimum pension benefits will 
cost Italy at least 30 trillion lire (18.75 billion dollars), 
Labor Minister Clemente Mastella confirmed today at the end of a 
meeting with Mario Colombo, the special commissioner in charge 
of the National Social Security Institute (INPS). 
  Colombo said the effects of the ruling were "terrifying" as 
Mastella explained that within the 30 trillion price tag were 
the funds in arrears and the costs of an earlier Constitutional 
Court ruling on the transfer of benefits to the heir of a 
deceased person drawing a pension. Some 7,000 cases were 
covered by the December ruling, he said. 
  Tomorrow, the labor minister will confer with the three 
economics ministers, Budget, Treasury and Finance, and then the 
"hot potato" will reach the premier's office. "It is obvious 
that an issue of this breadth will directly involve the premier 
as well. The matter concerns the government as a whole," added 
Mastella. 
  He went on to say, "After a meeting with Colombo Saturday 
[11 
June], I thought it might rain. This is not the case. It's a 
flood." An initial check of the figures involved was enough to 
make "one lose one's head," he stressed. 
  Also speaking out today on the nation's social security 
system was Budget Minister Giancarlo Pagliarini who said that 
the pension system is devoid of ethics, is burdened by pension 
debt towards the citizens made up of pension benefits already 
payable of some 3,000 trillion lire (187.5 billion dollars) and 
must be changed. 
  On the attack in a statement delivered at a conference in 
Milan, the minister said the present system "forces our children 
to pay our pensions." In other words, "with the contributions 
we pay, we are not building our own pensions but a sort of 
credit towards those who will pay us our pensions." 
  On the transfer of funds from state coffers to INPS, 
Pagliarini said these transfers in 1994 will come to 74 trillion 
lire (46.25 billion dollars), "equal to the cost of three 
tunnels under the English Channel or about 14 percent of gross 
domestic product." 
  On the side of remedies, the minister said he wanted to see 
"the removal of all fiscal dis-incentives on pension funds to 
get them started immediately." 
  Pagliarini also said he would favor a mid-year supplementary 
budget of five trillion lire (3.125 billion dollars) and noted 
that a decision along these lines would be up to Premier Silvio 
Berlusconi. 
  Meeting members of the foreign press here, the minister 
recalled that the budget deficit target for the year is 154 
trillion lire whereas the figure of 159 trillion (nearly 100 
billion dollars) has been indicated as more realistic. 
  He also spoke of the prospect of another correction required 
for the shortfall of up to 30 trillion lire in INPS accounts as 
a result of the court ruling.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Constitutional Court on Social </F>
Security Ruling"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 15 -- "The figures fired out over 
the last few days are not credible," said Constitutional Court 
President Paolo Casavola today on the court's controversial 
ruling on pension backpayments that has been estimated as 
widening the INPS [National Agency for Social Security] pension 
agency deficit by figures ranging from 9 to 30 trillion lire 
(5.6 to 18.75 billion dollars), and possibly spelling a 
corrective mini-budget. 
  Expressing puzzlement over the discrepancy in the figures, 
Casavola said the Court was told by INPS on April 15 that its 
sentence would cost 9 trillion lire. 
  "What are we supposed to do about it if the head of INPS 
then 
provides the government with different figures," he went on, 
referring to this week's INPS estimate of 22 trillion lire. 
Labor Minister Clemente Mastella has put the total bill even 
higher, at 30 trillion lire. 
  "INPS is a public body, there ought to be some sort of 
public 
data bank," said Casavola, reiterating that it was the Court's 
job to judge laws, not to suggest how laws should be financed in 
accordance with the constitutional requirement that every law 
have adequate cover. 
  But he described the INPS pickle as the result of 
"improvident" past policy, claiming that previous governments 
had ignored its warnings. 
  As to the possibility of the backpayments being spread over 
different fiscal years, Casavola said it was "up to the 
government to decide how it is to find the financial cover." 
  Commenting indirectly on the furore caused by its ruling, 
Casavola hinted at a need for the Court to work more closely 
with parliament in framing action to prevent such financial 
problems coming to a head with apparently little warning. He 
expressed favour for the German model, where "the court 
expresses an opinion, giving parliament the time to intervene 
and adjust things." 
  Casavola also described the polemics over the repayment of 
an 
85,000 lire lump-sum healthcare tax as "demagogical." "Young 
people spend more than that when they go to the disco," he said. 
  The court has around 50 public spending cases pending, 
Casavola said. 
  The INPS press office clarified later that the cost of 
making 
backdated supplementary payments to about 600,000 
pension-holders was initially estimated at 9 trillion lire, but 
could rise to 16 trillion lire, "as recognised even by a 
Constitutional Court expert" if it were to apply to all the 
pension-holders who had not received these payments as of 
September 30 last year. 
  The 16 trillion becomes 22 trillion by adding in the 6 
trillion lire cost of a second Constitutional Court ruling, last 
December, making pensions reversible, INPS said. 
  The rough figure attributed to Mastella is a stab at 
including extra costs for interest payments and monetary 
fluctuations, which "cannot be quantified until the dates of 
sentence pronouncement and application are known," INPS said. 
It denied receiving a request "on April 15 or any other date" 
for a cost estimate from the Court.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Gnutti Unveils Industry Ministry </F>
Decentralisation"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 15 -- Industry Minister Vito 
Gnutti today unveiled plans to bring ministerial services closer 
to its users, especially the small and medium firms that are 
Italy's industrial backbone. 
  The essence of the plan is decentralisation, a concept close 
to the heart of a Northern Leaguer like Gnutti. A user-friendly 
network of outlets will be set up nationwide, providing 
businessmen with the information they often complain is slow in 
coming from central offices in Rome, on tax breaks, funding, law 
changes, and work opportunities. 
  For the preparatory period, Gnutti said a six-month 
extension 
would be necessary for staff seconded into the Industry Ministry 
from other departments including the now-defunct southern 
development agency. After that, staff will be taken on to man 
the new outlying offices. 
  Boosting small and medium-sized industry is a key goal of 
the 
new-look ministry, Gnutti told the press. His targets include: 
stepping up relations with the anti-trust authority; enhancing 
protection for the consumer; transferring technology to small 
and medium firms; seeking out new markets; boosting funding to 
smaller firms; fostering broader share ownership; and pressing 
on with ministry re-organisation. 
  On privatisations, Gnutti confirmed the government's 
intention to press ahead with the disposals of INA [National 
Insurance Institute], ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation], 
ENEL [National Electric Power Board]. On EFIM [Manufacturing 
Industry Holding and Financial Company], he recalled that the 
liquidation deadline is January 25, and revealed that problems 
in the armaments, rail and aluminium sectors had emerged from 
talks with liquidator Alberto Predieri.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Industrial Production Climb </F>
Confirms Recovery"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 17 -- Industrial production in 
Italy rose 0.4 percent in the first four months of the current 
year which, together with an upswing in electricity consumption, 
has confirmed that the economy is on the path to recovery. 
  The national statistics bureau ISTAT [Central Statistics 
Institute] said the 0.4 percent increase was coupled with a 1 
percent decline in April but, adjusting the fact that this year 
there were two less working days than in April 1993, the daily 
production growth was 7.5 percent. 
  The state electricity utility ENEL [National Electric Power 
Board] reported that the demand for electricity on its and other 
networks were by 4 percent gross and 2.9 percent after 
adjustment, and followed the 3.4 percent increase reported in 
April, and that both confirmed that industrial production was on 
the upswing. In the first five months of the year, ENEL added, 
the demand for electricity had risen by an overall 1.6 percent 
over the same period in 1993. 
  In the industrial sector alone, ENEL said, the increase in 
demand for May was 3 percent and was evident in all sectors 
except construction. 
  According to ISTAT, the industrial sectors which showed the 
greatest increases in production were: business machines, up 7.6 
percent; clothing, 5 percent; automobiles, 4.5 percent; 
petroleum production, 3.7 percent; and rubber and plastic, up 3 
percent. 
  Running against this trend were the sectors of transport 
means other than automobiles, down 14.1 percent; precision 
instruments, off 9.2 percent; radio-television and 
telecommunications devices, 8.7 percent; metal products, 8.1 
percent; and the working of non- ferrous minerals, down 5 
percent. 
  For the first four months of the year, ISTAT added, an 
increase of 1.9 percent was recorded for the intermediate goods 
sector and 0.8 percent for consumer goods, while investment good 
dropped by 5.8 percent. 
  There was also a 10.7 increase in footwear production, a 4 
percent climb in lumber production, rubber and plastics rose by 
3.4 percent, while there was a 5.7 percent increase in the 
industrial production of mechanical machines and devices, 2.6 
percent for textiles, 1.4 percent for paper and publishing, 1 
percent for chemicals, and a 1.8 percent increase for various 
sectors. 
  At the other end of the spectrum, industrial production 
declined by 5 percent for mining, 3.4 percent for foods, 2.6 
percent for petroleum, 2.6 percent for metal products, 0.3 
percent for finished minerals, 7.2 percent for transport means 
and 0.9 percent for electricity and gas.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Anti-Mafia Commission Taking </F>
Shape in Parliament"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 16 -- A new and more powerful 
Parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission began taking shape in the 
Lower House today with unanimous approval of legislation which 
will now be sent on to the Senate for passage into law. 
  The judiciary authority of the commission, empowered to call 
on the work of judiciary police officials "and all others for 
cooperation, as deemed necessary," will be enhanced by allowing 
the commission to set aside the official secrets act for matters 
pertaining to the Mafia, the Camorra, the 'Ndrangheta or any 
other criminal organization. 
  Thanks to an amendment tacked on to the bill by the House 
Constitutional Affairs Committee, the official secrets act 
cannot be made to prevail against Anti-Mafia Commission 
investigations because the issues linked to Mafia-type organized 
crime activities are now giving equal standing with "facts of 
subversion in the constitutional sphere." 
  The commission will be made up of 25 Senators and 25 members 
of the Lower House picked by the respective speakers on a 
proportional basis so that the strength of the parliamentary 
groups is reflected in the commission. The chairman will be 
installed by both speakers following agreement on a name. 
  The basic duties of the Parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission 
are to review legislation on organized crime, draft proposals 
and keep close tabs on the Mafia and similar organizations. The 
commission reports on its work to the full Parliament at least 
once each year and at any other time as required. 
  Among the powers of the commission are those of conducting 
hearings for taking testimony and depositions, issuing subpoenas 
for reports and documents on investigations in course and 
establishing which reports or documents must remain in the realm 
of judiciary secrecy. 
  A witness found guilty of perjury in testimony given to the 
commission comes under the criminal law provision which carries 
a sentence of from six months to three years in prison for this 
crime. The same sentence can be passed on those found guilty of 
violations of official secrecy applied by the commission to 
investigation documents. 
  Handling coordination of the judicial powers of the 
commission and law enforcement services are one or more 
magistrates and one or more Interior Ministry officials, named 
respectively by the Justice and Interior Ministries, who sit on 
the commission. 
  The commission's staff and premises are made available by 
the 
speaker of the Lower House and the bill for running the body is 
shared equally by the two houses. 
  Commenting on Lower House approval of the legislation, MP 
Tiziana Parenti, a magistrate and in the running for the chair 
of the commission, spoke out on the need for a "firm response 
from the institutions to the renewal of Mafia attacks on the 
state." 
  Parenti was apparently referring to the spectacular jail 
break Tuesday [14 June] of a Mafia boss detained in Padua, 
sprung at dawn by four men dressed as Carabinieri policemen, and 
the latest in a string of firebombings of Progressive and 
Democratic Party of the Left quarters in Sicily which came early 
this morning. 
  A Progressive candidate for the post, Pino Arlacchi, said, 
"We are not concerned with arguments about the validity of 
state's witnesses and on less-harsh prison regimes. We are 
worried by the actions of the Mafia which seem to have been 
renewed with vigor in these days." 
  The head of the Forza Italia caucus, Raffaele Della Valle, 
said the amendment on the state secrets act "sends an important 
signal to the nation because this shows that the government 
looks at the Mafia as the anti-state." 
  In this connection an MP for Communist Refoundation cited 
what he said was the danger of "re-forging relations between the 
Mafia and the state" and declared, "Let's remember that before 
Falcone and Borsellino were killed by explosives, they had been 
slain by isolation," with reference to leading anti-Mafia 
magistrates murdered in 1992.

Battle Is Raging Over D'Alema"] 
  [Text] Rome -- A race against the clock has started for 
[Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Deputy Secretary] Massimo 
D'Alema, who so far is the only "visible" and accredited 
candidate nominated to succeed Achille Occhetto as secretary of 
the PDS. PDS officials responsible for political coordination 
are to call a meeting of the National Council -- the 
miniparliament entrusted with the task of electing the secretary 
-- on 28 and 29 June. It will not be easy for D'Alema to take 
over the party's leadership, however. In order to do so, he 
will need to obtain a majority plus one in the National Council, 
comprising approximately 500 members -- but Occhetto intends to 
stand in the way. [Venice Mayor] Cacciari has invited the PDS 
to postpone the election until November and constitute an 
interim "directory" which will guide the transition process and 
enable the party to work out its position in relation to the 
progressive coalition as a whole. However, D'Alema cannot 
afford to wait: [L'UNITA editor] Veltroni might become a 
dangerous opponent.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Michele Salvati: "Weight of Roots"] </F>
  [Text] The major newspapers and principal political forces 
have responded to Achille Occhetto's resignation with respect 
and approval: approval because it is right for the leader of a 
defeated party to resign; approval because Occhetto's 
resignation could rouse the opposition, which in the 
two-and-a-half months since the 27-28 March elections has seemed 
either dazed or resigned, disorganized or excessive in its 
reactions. 
  The country needs a good opposition, if it refuses to be 
satisfied with that conducted by [League Secretary] Bossi within 
the government. It needs one both because we have a government 
composed of very diversified forces that has to carry out some 
enormously difficult tasks: This also makes the opposition's 
task more difficult, since it will have to wisely alternate 
stances of strict monitoring and counteraction with open 
cooperation. It also needs one because we have two oppositions 
now, one of which has by no means accepted the realignment of 
our political life between two poles. Therefore the part of the 
opposition that has accepted (and, indeed, stimulated) this 
realignment bears an even greater mission. Will Occhetto's 
resignation succeed in stimulating within the PDS [Democratic 
Party of the Left], and the Left as a whole, a response equal to 
this mission? 
  Those who, despite the evidence of the facts, still hope for 
an evolution of our political system toward a normal and 
civilized democracy of rotation can now only hope for this. 
However, there are two major difficulties. The first concerns 
the opposition that refuses to accept bipolarism -- the PPI 
[Italian Popular Party] and the Pact. 
  The PDS and the left-wing forces can do little about them, 
since the responsibility and the decisions are not theirs. But 
this little is important: They can adopt a profile and a 
strategy which (while safeguarding a democratic left-wing 
identity and, indeed, making it clearer) will make an alliance 
of the center and left- wing forces desirable and beneficial. 
  This leads us to the second difficulty, the internal one 
within the PDS. Leaving aside wrenches and splits, the PDS as a 
whole has not changed much, either with regard to the people 
that lead it or with regard to its organizational structure. 
And these two things go hand in hand, since the leaders are the 
expression of this organizational structure; it is they, with 
the federation and section secretaries, with officials, 
activists, and party members, who maintain the relations of 
acquaintance, trust, and mutual loyalty. But this weighty 
organization, the fact that it is part of a long history, 
constitute both an asset and a drawback. They are an asset 
inasmuch as they grant the PDS social and regional roots that 
not even the Berlusconi hurricane has managed to dismantle, just 
as Craxi before him failed to do so. And now, as almost the 
whole of the Left of noncommunist origins has disappeared, these 
roots are all the more valuable. They are a drawback inasmuch 
as they make the PDS very cumbersome in its movements -- a party 
which, even more than in its adversaries' eyes, is (formerly) 
communist in the minds of its members. Being aware of this, 
Occhetto tried to impart a greater element of leadership to his 
secretaryship: The rejection of this approach was due much more 
to the nature of the party (which is neither Forza Italia nor 
Craxi's Italian Socialist Party: superlight parties) than to 
any personal shortcomings on his part. 
  This is why we must not expect too much from the debate that 
will begin and from whichever leader is elected. In its own 
way, the PDS is too "democratic," too responsible to the 
opinions and feelings of its activists and members to be able to 
introduce any drastic innovations. And in any case, why should 
it do so? Would it not thus risk losing a precious heritage? 
So it is entirely unrealistic to expect that the PDS could 
elect as its secretary a liberal such as [Venice Mayor] Cacciari 
or others like him, virtually unknown to the party structure. 
Rather, it is permissible to expect a step forward in the right 
direction. First, an in-depth debate on party strategy, on the 
election defeat, and on the tasks that the PDS must perform as 
an opposition force. Next, the choice of a leader who is both 
accepted by the organization and the members but nevertheless as 
little imbued with communist tradition as possible, and as open 
as possible to modern cultural tendencies, and who is capable of 
thoroughly renovating the organizational structure that is now 
paralyzing the party. 
  There are not many candidates. And there is a strong fear 
that we will miss the innovative capacity and the courage of 
Occhetto, with all his defects and weaknesses.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Left Democrats To Elect New Leader </F>
at End of Month"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 15 -- The national council of the 
Democratic Party of the Left will meet June 30 and July 1 to 
elect a new party leader to replace Achille Occhetto, who 
resigned Monday [13 June], council chairman Giglia Tedesco 
announced Wednesday. 
  The council meeting will be preceded by nationwide 
consultations with about 200 local party leaders, regional 
secretaries, mayors, union leaders and other party officials, 
announced Umberto Ranieri, one of eight members of a special 
commission formed yesterday to collect candidatures for the post. 
  Consultations should be completed by next Tuesday and "will 
be open," Tedesco said, "meaning that they are not aimed at 
verifying consensus on pre-existing candidatures, they are not a 
primary election in any way." 
  For his part, Ranieri said that, "today's top political 
problem is to prevent moderate voters from turning to the right 
and to stop Forza Italia from taking over the center," referring 
to the strong gains made by Premier Silvio Berlusconi's party in 
Sunday's European Parliament elections. 
  The other main issue, he said, is to find quickly a leader 
who has the support and trust of other members of the 
Progressive Alliance, a coalition led by the Left Democrats. 
  Separately, the man widely touted as the most likely 
candidate to replace Occhetto, Massimo D'Alema, said he had 
"many doubts" about the decision to name a new secretary 
immediately, rather than find a temporary solution until the 
party's national congress assembly can meet at the end of the 
year. 
  "We could have decided to name a collective body, a 
`directorate' of sorts until the congress is held," D'Alema told 
reporters. 
  Other party officials have suggested moving up the national 
congress to an earlier date.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "National Alliance Sharp on Rumoured </F>
Bribesville Moves"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Cagliari, June 18 -- The National Alliance 
(AN) representative at the Justice Ministry this morning 
signalled that his rightist group, one of the three main 
government partners alongside Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia 
and the Northern League, will fight a rumoured legislative 
solution to the Bribesville crisis as outlined in today's press. 
  Referring to press reports that Justice Minister Alfredo 
Biondi (of the Centrist Union, a close Berlusconi ally) is 
looking at an extension of plea bargaining and other measures, 
Justice Undersecretary Gian Franco Anedda said he was 
"absolutely against any reform of the penal code that will have 
the effect, or may be interpreted as having the effect, of 
easing the position of defendants being tried for crimes against 
public administration. All the more so if, in order to save them 
from jail once their guilt has been proven, an attempt is made 
to frame legislation that is preferential to all." 
  "I clearly manifested my opposition, in harmony with the 
National Alliance line, when the Minister tasked the ministerial 
offices with drafting an organic proposal on the subject, which 
must still be examined and discussed. I therefore deem 
absolutely immature the possibility of a bill being presented to 
cabinet. Unless Minister Biondi means to take the initiative 
upon himself alone, something which I rule out." 
  L'INDIPENDENTE, a paper normally seen as sympathetic to the 
government, featured most prominently this morning the latest 
alleged version of a "judicial solution" for the nationwide 
kickbacks scandal that has shaken the political and business 
establishments. "Biondi's Solution for Bribesville" was its 
main headline, over a summary of "a bill on extending plea 
bargaining, to be put to the cabinet shortly." 
  Among the measures listed were: "plea bargaining extended to 
crimes carrying sentences up to three and a half years; 
defendants have six months to confess their guilt; kickback 
offenders are barred from public office for five years and 
forced to pay back their ill-gotten gains." 
  "These norms will be valid for those who have already been 
sentenced under existing laws," it also highlighted. 
  A collection of law adjustments seen by opponents as letting 
offenders off too lightly, by proponents as offering a 
much-needed "political solution" to Bribesville, was slapped 
down by a national "whitewash" outcry and President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro's refusal to endorse it at the height of the scandals 
about 15 months ago. 
  Roughly 1,000 people, mostly politicians and businessmen, 
have been caught up in the Bribesville probes. The vast 
majority of the cases have yet to come to court, and magistrates 
are themselves in favour of streamlining procedures to avert 
what many fear will be serious system overload.

<F P=106> [Report by Ignacio Cembrero: "Gonzalez Rules Out Confidence </F>
Vote, Changing Government, and Bringing Forward Election"] 
  [Excerpt] Cartagena de Indias -- No confidence vote, 
change of government, or early election -- at least for the 
present. Head of government Felipe Gonzalez yesterday confirmed 
his intention to continue to govern with the support of 
Convergence and Union (CiU) despite the election defeat that he 
suffered Sunday [12 June], and is prepared to do so until the 
end of the legislative term. Gonzalez briefly received the 
Spanish news media just before the second day of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) began, 
and did so, as he said, so that the final news conference in the 
early hours of this morning would not center on Spanish 
political issues. 
  He looked well, perhaps because he has been going about in 
the Caribbean sunshine, or perhaps also because he notes "a 
special affection following Sunday's electoral setback" on the 
part of the Latin American heads of state attending the meeting. 
"With us (in power), the assessment they make is that they have 
fared very well," Gonzalez stressed, over and above the 
ideological difference that may exist between the Socialists and 
the democratic right. 
  According to Gonzalez, the first thing is to "conduct a 
serious analysis before taking decisions." "Hysterical 
reactions" must be avoided. At the outset, he said, "I do not 
rule out submitting a confidence motion," but this initiative 
should be undertaken only on the basis of the assumption that 
"you could lack the support to put through budgetary or 
legislative matters." "It cannot be just the consequence of an 
election that does not change the parliamentary arithmetic." 
  If a confidence vote is ruled out for the present, so is a 
cabinet reshuffle. "Government changes," he stressed, "are 
decided by the prime minister when he deems it advisable on the 
grounds of reorienting specific policies." "Making a change of 
government is not immediately anticipated." 
<H5>  Presiding Over EU </H5>
  Gonzalez is confident even of remaining in charge of the 
country when it is Spain's turn to preside over the European 
Union (EU), during the second half of 1995. "It will not be 
necessary to hold an election before 1 July of next year." 
"There is sufficient political and parliamentary stability to 
complete the legislative term." 
  He has not yet spoken with Generalitat (Catalan autonomous 
government) premier Jordi Pujol, who is traveling to Djakarta 
within the next few days -- "I will tell him to pass through 
Cartagena en route to Indonesia," he joked -- but it seems to 
him "normal" for CiU to deem the famous confidence vote 
unnecessary. "They say that we discuss specific programs and 
approve them. There has been no trouble. We do not believe 
that it is necessary to change that in any way. It is not 
necessary to change the PSOE's [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] 
and CiU's guidelines, which have operated precisely and 
regularly." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Luis R. Aizpeolea: "Socialists Rule Out Early </F>
Election"] 
  [Text] The People's Party [PP] has defeated the PSOE 
[Spanish Socialist Workers Party] in nationwide elections for 
the first time and has succeeded in clearly breaking the 
absolute majority held by the Socialists in Andalusia since 
1982. The Socialists yesterday acknowledged their defeat by the 
People's Party. This was made known by Socialist parliamentary 
group spokesman Joaquin Almunia, although he explained 
immediately afterward that domestic conclusions should not be 
drawn from these elections, and ruled out bringing forward the 
[general] election. PP Deputy Secretary General Mariano Rajoy 
said that the Spanish political map had changed, but he 
initially remained cautious and did not call for a general 
election, while Abel Matutes demanded that the government hold a 
confidence vote. 
  The European election results had a certain national color, 
manifested in an increase in the turnout compared to the 
previous elections of five years ago, although appreciably lower 
than that of the June 1993 legislative elections. 
  In the light of the first figures provided by the polls, the 
main parties' representatives were already playing on both 
aspects in order to express their stances. Mariano Rajoy, on 
behalf of the People's Party, emphasized that "the Spanish 
political map has changed" since the 1993 general election, and 
hence his party "will work on the formulation of a national 
blueprint." The PP leader avoided calling for an early 
election, despite his party's clear victory in the European 
elections, and maintained a cautious stance. 
  In his first assessment of the elections, PP list leader 
Abel 
Matutes maintained a tone similar to Rajoy's. In a moderate 
tone, he stated that these elections were a test of the 
government, and added that they are the "start of a political 
change." Matutes then added: "We will try to consolidate it by 
democratic means." 
  Socialist parliamentary group spokesman Joaquin Almunia 
began 
by acknowledging his party's defeat by the PP, but he then asked 
that these elections' results not influence domestic politics, 
and ruled out an early election, although he acknowledged that 
"matters should be given due consideration." The Socialist 
leader argued this stance in this way: "These are elections to 
the European Parliament; the general election was a year ago, 
and there is great deal of the legislative term to go." Almunia 
argued that "the turnout was appreciably lower than in last 
year's general election. Moreover, there was a certain 
reluctance to vote in the constituencies where we Socialists 
receive most support." 
<H5>  Economic Crisis </H5>
  For his part, PSOE Secretary for Organization Cipria Ciscar 
emphasized the need to distinguish this electoral process from 
that concerning a general election, and congratulated the PP on 
its first election victory. 
  Foreign Minister Javier Solana yesterday congratulated the 
PP 
and attributed the punitive vote against the government to the 
economic crisis. Despite his party's defeat, the minister 
interpreted Convergence and Union's increase as a sign that the 
Spanish people want a stable government. 
  The Catalan and Basque nationalists, who have improved their 
positions, were satisfied with the result yesterday, and have 
found that the policy of support for the government has not 
adversely affected them at the polls. The nationalists' result 
is the government's only consolation, insofar as its stability 
will not be attacked on that flank. 
  Inaki Anasagasti, Basque Nationalist Party spokesman in the 
Congress [of Deputies], was clear yesterday, as soon as the 
first election results were known. He stated that these 
elections should not affect domestic politics. Jose Perez 
Moreno, the spokesman of Democratic Union of Catalonia, the 
party allied with Convergence, expressed his satisfaction at the 
Catalan nationalists' increase in votes and stressed that they 
had overtaken the Socialists in Catalonia, which did not happen 
in the general election. 
  Isabelo Herreros, on behalf of United Left, was the only 
person to demand Felipe Gonzalez' resignation in light of the 
results. He emphasized the size of the turnout in comparison 
with the 1989 European elections, and called on Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez to act accordingly. "Let him resign," Herreros 
said. 
  But for the Socialists, the results of the Andalusian 
autonomous community elections are almost as bad as those of the 
European elections. In the Socialists' traditional fief, they 
have lost the absolute majority, with a considerable surge by 
the People's Party and United Left. Socialist Manuel Chaves, 
winner of the elections, will encounter difficulties in forming 
a government. The outcome prevents them from governing on their 
own, and their closest candidate with which to share the 
government -- United Left -- upholds stances very remote from 
the PSOE's.

<F P=106> [Report by "MF/RP": "World Trade Organization Headquarters: </F>
Switzerland Submits Improved Proposal to GATT"] 
  [Text] Geneva, 15 Jun (ATS) -- On Wednesday afternoon [15 
June], Switzerland submitted a second, improved proposal to GATT 
with a view to attracting the headquarters of the future World 
Trade Organization (WTO) to Geneva. The Swiss Confederation 
intends to donate the William Rappart Center building, which 
houses GATT, to the WTO. This offer by Switzerland comes right 
after the official application by Bonn. 
  Bern is also ready to build a new conference hall with a 
seating capacity of 725 and to make it available at no cost to 
the WTO. This hall, with a parking lot for 400 cars, would be 
built near the WTO. Moreover, Geneva has agreed to provide the 
40 less-favored nations with rooms to house their permanent 
mission. As far as the value of the real property is concerned, 
the Swiss proposals amount to about 100 million Swiss francs. 
  If they wish to do so, countries could have three permanent 
missions in Switzerland: one to the United Nations, one to the 
WTO, and one to the Disarmament Conference. Today, the various 
countries only have one mission to the United Nations. 
<H5>  Privileges </H5>
  The WTO and its officials will benefit from privileges and 
immunities enjoyed by the intergovernmental organizations in 
Switzerland. High-ranking officials will have diplomatic 
status. Bern also intends to take various measures to improve 
the standard of living of those employed by all the 
international organizations in Switzerland. 
  Geneva and Bonn are the only two cities that have applied to 
accommodate the headquarters of the WTO. The two bids will be 
submitted to the preparatory committee of the WTO on 23 and 24 
June. The final choice should be made by 15 July. 
<H5>  Confidence </H5>
  Diplomatic sources say Switzerland is in a good position. 
The 
offers made by Germany and Switzerland are almost equivalent. 
However, the fact that the GATT secretariat has been established 
in Geneva since it was created pleads in favor of Geneva. The 
need for close cooperation between the WTO and other 
international organizations in Geneva is another asset. 
  William Rossier, Swiss ambassador to GATT, thinks 
Switzerland 
has made an "excellent offer." In his opinion, Switzerland has 
shown that it wants to remain an attractive and important 
international center.

<F P=106> [Commentary by `Lz': "Is This Enough?"] </F>
  [Text] The federal law on the deployment of Swiss troops 
in peacekeeping missions has been rejected by a surprising 
majority. For the third time in almost two years, the Swiss 
people have voted in favor of being screened off from the 
outside world. The disappointing result does not just signify a 
no to the formation of a Swiss Blue Helmet battalion. It also 
signifies a brusque refusal toward international solidarity 
concerning security policy. In this way, Switzerland is 
avoiding a task that has gained in importance since the end of 
the Cold War, a task that other neutral countries have already 
been performing for several years. But the strong majority of 
our people do not seem to care about that. 
  From an internal political angle, it is not good that a new 
rift has emerged between the German and French-speaking parts of 
Switzerland, even though this rift is not as wide as it was 
during the European Economic Area vote. Apart from the two 
dual-language cantons of Freiburg and Wallis, all the 
French-speaking cantons spoke out in favor of an opening out to 
the world in the sphere of security policy. Even there, people 
are acquainted with the principles of the Swiss Confederation. 
Cantons containing large conurbations, such as Zurich, Bern, 
Basel-Stadt, and Basel-Lansdschaft, had a below-average number 
of no votes. 
  Switzerland was one of the first countries to adapt its 
security and political ideas to the post-1989 changes, and it 
was justifiably proud of its leading role in this regard. But 
today the country still seems reluctant to develop the 
nationwide strategy formulated in the Bundesrat's report on the 
1990's, and prefers to let circles of experts discuss this topic. 
  Detailed examinations will be required to establish 
individual reasons for the no vote. But it already seems clear 
that neutrality in its rigid form is more firmly rooted in 
society than was originally thought. Neutrality is viewed not 
so much a security strategy as an ambiguous, almost theoretical 
state slogan that remains valid whatever happens. At a time 
when everything is falling apart, there has to be something that 
remains unaltered, many citizens probably say to themselves. 
People conclude that in the current world political situation, 
traditional patterns of thought and conduct are not always 
suitable. 
  The opponents to the deployment of Swiss peacekeeping troops 
took advantage of this mood. With an avalanche of propaganda 
that did not stop short of false statements and made a laughing 
stock of foreign policy moves, they created the impression that 
by deploying Blue Helmets, Switzerland would be engaging itself 
in a war. In this way, fears were aroused that made moral and 
humanitarian calls for solidarity unheard. Nevertheless, the 
opponents did not succeed in separating the subject of Blue 
Helmets from our basic relationship toward the United Nations. 
The dramatic financial situation and the debate on old-age and 
survivor pensions might have contributed to the negative result. 
Last but not least, the result might indicate a certain 
mistrust in the government. 
  What are the consequences of the 12 June vote? The point now 
is to make maximum use of existing possibilities, which means 
that unarmed military personnel are to be placed at the disposal 
of the United Nations also in future. A further development is 
possible in this sphere. The work of the disaster assistance 
corps and International Red Cross is to receive continued 
support, something that the opponents to the deployment of Blue 
Helmets should be reminded of. During the prevote campaign, 
they did not tire of telling people that it is these two 
organizations that require support, and not the Blue Helmets. 
  The refusal to Swiss Blue Helmets hardly effects national 
defense, but it remains to be seen whether the principle of 
peacekeeping can retain its credibility if a country with a 
400,000-strong army refuses to deploy 600 Blue Helmets. From a 
foreign policy angle, it remains to be seen whether the 
international community will continue to be interested in the 
services of a country that does not want to fulfill a major 
military-diplomatic task. The terrain for Swiss foreign policy 
is certainly not going to be easier. It will take some effort 
to convince our neighbors that a refusal to implement an 
important political task does not mean isolation, for there is 
no question that after the 12 June vote, Switzerland continues 
to rely on international cooperation.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Jean Carbonare, spokesman of the </F>
International Human Rights Federation, by Patrick de 
Saint-Exupery; place and date not given: "The French President 
Knew..."] 
  [Text] The author of an official report published in early 
1993 on early indications of genocide in Rwanda, Jean Carbonare, 
accuses the Elysee [office of the president office] with 
deliberately choosing to ignore proven facts. 
  "When one knows and remains silent, while continuing to 
support a regime that systematically eliminates its opponents, 
one is necessarily an accessory to the crime. Today I accuse 
President Mitterrand of being guilty, at the very least, of 
criminal conspiracy." Jean Carbonare does not mince his words 
and yet he does not sound angry. "Now that people are talking 
of bringing the perpetrators of this crime against humanity to 
trial, I ask the question: `How far must we go?'" 
  A member of the commission of inquiry mandated in 1993 by 
the 
International Human Rights Federation (IHRF) to look into 
Rwanda's "death squads," Jean Carbonare is, quite simply, 
indignant. Being an expert in African affairs who has been 
following the situation in Rwanda for some 20 years, he does not 
understand why the Elysee refused to take proven facts into 
account. 
  The IHRF report clearly showed how the militias operated; it 
spelled out their crimes and identified the persons responsible. 
It described how a "machine" was put together which could start 
laying the country to waste at any time: "As early as 1993, the 
machine was ready. All the government had to do to start the 
madness was press on the gas pedal. This happened on 7 April; 
it could have happened much earlier." 
  Several times after the IHRF report was published, Jean 
Carbonare contacted French officials, especially the Elysee's 
African department. He says: "They told me that things were 
going to get better, that one had to be patient. They knew 
perfectly well what was happening in Rwanda, but they had taken 
sides. Shortly after our report came out, President 
Habyarimana, whom we identified as one of the death squads' 
sponsors, was received in Paris by President Mitterrand with 
full honors." 
<H5>  Elysee Denies Charges </H5>
  Referring to a comment made to him by the Elysee about 
Rwanda's rebels, Jean Carbonare says: "The RPF [Rwandan 
Patriotic Front], we will crush it!" In other words: The 
Elysee is totally behind the Habyarimana regime. Asked about 
this yesterday, Bruno Delaye, the head of the Elysee's African 
department, denied saying anything of the kind. 
  Jean Carbonare adds that "the French Army helped train those 
responsible for the slaughter. These were people who knew -- 
and so did our ambassadors -- that the systematic killing of 
opponents was being planned. According to our research, 10,000 
to 15,000 people were probably assassinated between 1990 and 
1993. We passed on this information. Why was there no 
response?" 
  He "ruefully" notes that when the French Army intervened in 
early April to evacuate foreign nationals, "Rwanda's army and 
the militias hailed our troops. A few hours earlier, the very 
men who were welcoming the country of human rights, had started 
the slaughter." 
<H5>  `France Should Keep Low Profile' </H5>
  Today, Jean Carbonare commends the initiative taken by 
French 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, but regrets that it looks like an 
attempt to patch up a self-inflicted wound. Today, France 
"should keep a low profile and steer clear of any military 
intervention, however well-meaning." France should also 
"listen" to RPF officials. "These people are quite wary about 
our country. They do not trust us at all. However, I still 
think that it is possible for us and them to talk on a basis of 
mutual respect." 
  RPF leaders find it extremely difficult to moderate their 
men. Says Jean Carbonare: "RPF President Alexis Kanyarengwe 
told me he had to send to the rear many young men who had `gone 
off their rocker' after facing the horror during their 
offensive." 
  Jean Carbonare tries to distinguish between "the RPF, whose 
members did commit a number of war crimes, and the other side, 
that of Rwanda's Government, its army, the militias, which are 
definitely guilty of genocide."

<F P=106> [Report by Jean-Pierre Tuquoi: "Official French Employers' </F>
Delegation Plans Visit to Baghdad"] 
  [Text] French business circles are reacting increasingly 
negatively toward the maintaining of the trade embargo against 
Iraq. While Iraqi managers multiply visits to Paris, an official 
employers' delegation is planning to travel discreetly to 
Baghdad on 24 or 25 June, from Jordan, where the CNPF [National 
Confederation of French Employers] delegation will also be 
staying at the same time. 
  After Israel, Iraq. Last month, a CNPF delegation, led by 
its chairman Francois Perigot, made an official visit to Tel 
Aviv, ending years of ostracism of the Jewish state. Now it is 
Iraq's turn to welcome France's employers. 
  No doubt this will be a very discreet, almost clandestine 
visit. The 20 or so companies on the trip (including, according 
to our information, Citroen, Renault, Alcatel, EDF [French 
Electricity Company], Schneider, Babcock, and others) have 
planned to make only a detour to Iraq, under the pretext of an 
official visit to Jordan on 24 and 25 June. But this is one of 
those visits whose symbolic importance outweighs its brevity. 
Any one can be sure that the Baghdad regime will take 
advantage, if only toward its public opinion, of the discussions 
which the French delegation will have with Iraqi leaders (no 
doubt with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz, or even with 
Saddam Husayn, who doubles as head of state and head of 
government). 
  It is true that Baghdad is in an unpleasant position. On 18 
July, the UN Security Council will examine, as it does every two 
months, whether it is appropriate to maintain or lift the 
embargo against Iraq decreed in 1990, immediately after the 
invasion of Kuwait. Barring last minute surprises, everything 
leads us to believe that once again, the "most hideous crime of 
history" (as the Iraqi press describes the embargo) will be left 
untouched, and that, from August onward, Baghdad will have to 
undergo a fifth year of embargo. 
  This status quo is due to Washington's intransigence. For 
Washington and its British ally, Saddam Husayn's regime has 
still not conformed to the many UN resolutions and "sanctions 
must remain in place," at least until the end of the year. 
  France would like to be more accommodating, in the name of 
"progress" made by Iraq on the path of disarmament. In the name 
also of commercial interests. With Iraq, these were previously 
substantial. In 1982, in the midst of the Iran-Iraq conflict, 
Baghdad absorbed more than 7 percent of France's non-OECD 
exports, making Paris Iraq's third largest supplier of 
non-military goods. 
<H5>  Oil Contracts </H5>
  It is the threads of this privileged relationship which the 
French groups are discreetly trying to retie, pending the 
eventual lifting of the embargo. Thus, several French companies 
are negotiating agreement protocols with Baghdad for the repair 
of equipment previously sold by France. This is already the 
case in the water treatment area, and will no doubt be so soon 
in the telephone sector. A delegation of senior officials from 
the Iraqi Transport and Communications Ministry is currently 
negotiating with Alcatel [French telecommunications concern]. 
"Between Frenchmen and Iraqis, the welcoming back has been 
warm," we are assured by a businessman who frequently shuttles 
between Paris and Baghdad. 
  All these deals which are being arranged have a strong smell 
of oil about them. Heavily in debt and lacking foreign 
currency, Baghdad is relying on its crude oil resources (10 
percent of world reserves) to finance the reconstruction of the 
country. In this area, too, French companies are in the lead 
(footnote 1) (Dr. Fadel A. Othman [name as published], the 
director general of SOMO, the company in charge of selling Iraqi 
crude, will be in Paris on 27 June to take part in a symposium.) 
For more than two years, ELF has been negotiating for the 
exploitation of the giant Majnoun oil field in the south of 
Iraq. Total is similarly negotiating for the Nahr-Umr field, 
also in the south of the country, while Italy's AGIP is well 
placed to obtain the operator slot for Halfaya, a third "giant" 
field. (Footnote 2) (Exploitation of a fourth giant field, that 
of West Kurnah, is said to have been entrusted to the Russians, 
who already began exploiting it several years ago with the help 
of the French engineering company Technip.) On each of these 
fields, whose exploitation will require billions of dollars, the 
French and Italian companies will not remain alone. If 
negotiations are successful, they will have to integrate their 
participation and, with Baghdad's blessing, bring in foreign -- 
probably American and British -- partners. 
  But will ELF and Total, who maintain difficult relationships 
in Iraq, end up carrying off the deal after years of laborious 
discussions? Will Baghdad not finally prefer foreign 
competitors? "Negotiations are well advanced. The items still 
open no longer constitute an obstacle," one of the negotiators 
affirmed. "The decision whether or not to sign the contracts 
lies now with Baghdad."

<F P=106> [Report signed "P.R.": "President Francois Mitterrand Wants </F>
To `Revisit Cancun'"] 
  [Text] Three weeks before the summit of the world's seven 
richest countries (G-7), Francois Mitterrand brought up the idea 
of giving a new impetus to cooperation between rich and poor 
countries, critically reviewing the performance of the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which is 
about to celebrate its 50th anniversary. "Development aid must 
be turned into aid that is geared toward the respect of economic 
and social contracts.... What we must do is reinvent the notion 
of international development, with financial austerity being 
only a means to an end, not an end in itself," he said. The 
president suggested that "a new North-South contract" be 
established and that "Cancun should be revisited" (a reference 
to the conference which took place there 13 years ago). Such a 
"contract" would stipulate that rich countries allocate 0.7 
percent of GDP to development aid, an annual amount of $130 
billion, i.e., twice as much as the current amount. The 
president also criticized IMF procedures to allocate special 
drawing rights: "Up to now, in this respect, the IMF has mostly 
been a cash cow for rich countries." He will therefore advocate 
a new $50-billion donation, which he deems possible due to low 
inflationary pressures.

  [Text] [Announcer] Now we go the World Cup -- Oh, but 
before that, we can go live to the office of the prime minister 
for a statement by Mr. Balladur: 
  [Balladur] Well, after the European elections, I wanted to 
draw conclusions in consultation with the representatives of all 
the electoral lists present in the European Parliament [EP]. It 
seemed to me that these elections had, on the one hand, revealed 
a feeling of dissatisfaction among our compatriots on the way in 
which Europe was working, though they did not in the main call 
into question their basic attachment to Europe; on the other 
hand, these elections have resulted in a fragmentation of 
France's representation in the EP, which could be damaging to 
the interests of our country. 
  I have drawn the following two conclusions, about which I 
wanted to inform the representatives of the EP: 
  The first is that the coordination of the activity of French 
officials in Brussels must be better organized. For this 
reason, I will preside over a monthly meeting prepared by Mr. 
Alain Lamassoure, the minister for European affairs, where we 
will examine developments in Brussels -- directives, regulations 
-- which we sometimes feel are adopted without sufficient 
national consultation. 
  Second, in order to fight against the unfortunate effects of 
the fragmentation of the French delegation in the EP, I have 
proposed that, every month, French members of the EP from all 
parties should meet with the European affairs minister, so that 
they can be informed of what the government is doing, of what 
its policies are, what it is currently debating, and so that the 
debate in the EP is coordinated with the government. In other 
words, to put things very simply.... 
  [Announcer interrupts] Well, that was what the prime 
minister had to say live after meeting with the leaders of the 
European election lists this morning.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Rioufol (Paris) and Jean-Paul Picaper </F>
(Bonn): "Questions Regarding the European Networks of the FIS"] 
  [Excerpts] Supposedly, the [Algerian] Islamic Salvation 
Front (FIS) maintains terrorist networks in France, as well as 
Europe, that have specialized in arms trafficking and procuring 
forged documents. Yet another illustration of this has just 
been provided by the arrest in Marseilles of a 30-year-old 
Algerian illegal immigrant named Abderrahamane Messaoui. This 
man, who is presumed to be a member of the FIS, was arrested 
last Sunday by the 6th Central Division of the French Criminal 
Investigation Department. Yesterday he was moved to Paris and 
immediately sent before the antiterrorist judge Jean-Louis 
Bruguiere, before being detained pending further proceedings. 
Messaoui is suspected of being a "liaison agent" acting as a 
go-between for Islamic fundamentalists in France and other 
European networks of fundamentalists. [passage omitted] 
  "Tracked" to Marseilles, Messaoui was apprehended Sunday in 
the city of Air-Bel, where he was staying with a friend, one 
Kamel A. Some sources claim that the Islamic fundamentalist 
was preparing to return to Algeria. He was charged with 
conspiracy and stealing and receiving forged administrative 
documents. According to the initial findings of the inquiry, 
the FIS sympathizer supposedly took possession of forged 
Algerian documents in Lille, a fact that would explain his 
presence at the home of Chaid Eddour when the police carried out 
a check last March. 
  However, the investigators will above all be examining 
Messaoui's supposed relations with certain Islamic networks 
established in Europe, more particularly in the Netherlands, and 
especially in Germany. There are certain indications that 
Messaoui was in fact constantly in touch with FIS "dignitaries" 
who are currently refugees in Germany. 
<H5>  Pacifist Policy </H5>
  Most of them are gathered together in Aachen, where Rabah 
Kebir, the former Islamic fundamentalist teacher and professor 
of chemistry and physics, now turned foreign spokesman for the 
executive body of the FIS, has his home. Last February, Kebir 
saw all political activity in Germany banned, and so far his 
request for political asylum has not been accepted. 
  Of course, the FIS headquarters in Germany maintains that it 
"represents the pacifist policy of the FIS" and categorically 
denies any links with the trafficking of arms or forged 
documents. However, the fact remains that Abdelhakim Boutrif, 
the FIS "smuggler" apprehended in Meurthe-et-Moselle, was backed 
by an Algerian known to the German criminal police force (BKA), 
who also lives in Aachen. Having arrived in Germany in 1993, 
this man is alleged to be the FIS's most senior figure abroad in 
charge of organizational matters. In January he already 
chartered the ship MS-Ibn-Siradj to take on a cargo of arms in 
Antwerp. Meanwhile, in mid-January 1994, the German Embassy in 
Algiers sent out a memo announcing that the FIS was planning 
shipments of arms originating in Central Europe. 
  In actual fact, some sources claim that the watchwords of 
the 
Islamic fundamentalists abroad are spelled out primarily by the 
refugee FIS headquarters in Germany and then relayed by secret 
networks set up in various European countries, including the 
Benelux countries and France, of course, where the 
fundamentalist mosques serve as agreed meeting places. This 
international dimension of the FIS networks, a vague picture of 
which seems to be emerging following the arrest of Abderrahamane 
Messaoui, is an area that the investigation starting up in 
France could probe further, no doubt in collaboration with the 
justice departments of the other countries involved.

<F P=106> [Report by Thierry Portes: "Faced With Balladur, the UDF </F>
and RPR Step Up the Pace"] 
  [Text] Now that the last electoral hurdle before the 
presidential election is past, those close to [French Democratic 
Union, UDF] President) Valery Giscard d'Estaing and [Rally for 
the Republic (RPR) President] Jacques Chirac intend to "regain 
control" and reduce [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur's room to 
maneuver with regard to the big 1995 election date between now 
and the summer. This is an offensive which the prime minister 
hopes to contain by relying on his political contacts, 
especially within the liberal-centrist confederation, and by 
relaunching the government's action. 
  The UDF and RPR leaderships did not take long to learn the 
lessons of the majority's division in the European elections. 
Charles Millon, chairman of the UDF group in the National 
Assembly who is close to Valery Giscard d'Estaing, on the one 
hand; and RPR Secretary General Alain Juppe and his deputy 
Jean-Louis Debre, who are both close to Jacques Chirac, on the 
other, have reached the same conclusion: The majority will find 
it difficult to present a single candidate in the first round of 
the presidential election. 
  It is the success of Mr. de Villiers' list in the European 
elections which has just reduced this likelihood, they explain, 
without regretting it too much. The chasm into which [former 
Socialist Party, PSF Secretary General] Michel Rocard, the 
former "natural candidate of the PSF," fell on 12 June permits 
an extremely bold stance. 
  For instance, Mr. Millon has just stated that the "majority 
union is not enough." Mr. Debre talks of "the obvious 
impossibility of preventing a particular majority figure from 
seeking the supreme office...." 
  Mr. Juppe, also thinking about the presidential election, 
wondered whether it would not have been preferable in the 
European elections to "organize a competition with one candidate 
for each of the big families" of the majority. From questions 
to calculations, the UDF and RPR leaderships postponed the 
question of the single candidate in 1995 and proposed, in the 
meantime, a "contract" to the majority leaders. 
  In his "contract," Mr. Millon calls on the UDF and RPR each 
to establish a plan for the coming seven-year term. After that, 
he explained with false naivete, the majority will see whether 
it should have one or several candidates in the presidential 
election. 
  Mr. Juppe, speaking on the RPR's behalf, has just given 
approval to this approach. In his "contract," Mr. Debre was 
anxious to reaffirm that "the political parties should not 
impose their plan on the candidate for the supreme office," 
because it is for him and him alone to present his plan, 
according to Gaullist precepts. 
<H5>  Chirac in Readiness </H5>
  This detail comes at the right time, because Jacques Chirac 
is now ready to present the broad outlines of his presidential 
platform. The ideal, for the Chirac supporters, would therefore 
be for the UDF and RPR leaderships to agree to "bury," at least 
temporarily, the principle of the single candidate. 
  Then, between now and the long vacation, Jacques Chirac 
should sound out the majority with some of his proposals. If no 
more than some 20 UDF deputies, among all those who are being 
approached by the RPR leadership, approve of the broad outlines 
put forward, Jacques Chirac, taking care not to officially enter 
the race, would have given greater credibility to his candidacy 
for the highest office. 
  This is obviously all just conjecture. Mr. Chirac, who had 
discovered on his return from Vietnam that his close aides were 
thinking of him to head the majority list in the European 
elections, is currently in the United States. 
  In addition, [Interior Minister] Pasqua and [Assembly 
Speaker] Seguin are due to express their views on Sunday [19 
June]. The most elementary courtesy therefore makes it 
necessary not to move too quickly. 
  For his part, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, who also hopes to play 
his presidential card, has announced that between now and the 
summer, he would make proposals "for the return to full 
employment." 
  But the UDF president is not in a good position in the 
opinion polls, and the Republican Party leadership, currently 
the guardian of Mr. Balladur's interests, is trying to resist 
him. "We want to exist and we do not want others to make 
decisions for us," Ladislas Poniatowski said yesterday on Monte 
Carlo Radio, to explain the PR deputies' latest acrobatic 
maneuver. This party's spokesman said that "we must seek a 
candidate who attracts the greatest possible consensus." And 
that "it is obvious that" Edouard Balladur "now has this image 
more than the others."

<F P=106> [Report by Henri Paillard: "UDF Group Threatened with </F>
Division"] 
  [Excerpt] The UDF [French Democratic Union] caucus in the 
National Assembly is probably on the point of collapsing. The 
27 deputies from the PR [Republican Party] who, on the morning 
of Tuesday, 14 June, announced the creation of an independent 
parliamentary group and who had postponed the implementation of 
their decision after being "bawled out" by [Industry Minister] 
Gerard Longuet, stand by their intentions. Following the PR 
National Council meeting scheduled for 26 June, a good 60 could 
well split off. They would thus break up a group of 213 
deputies laboriously set up just after the parliamentary 
elections. 
  In this affair, individual interests, personal ambitions, 
animosity, lies, and threats form a framework in which it is 
sometimes difficult to see clearly...especially because the 
tactics and strategy are highly "microcosmic" and escape the 
understanding of the so-called grass-roots voter. 
  While PR President Gerard Longuet, who is also one of Mr. 
Balladur's ministers, is urging his friends to stay in the 
existing single group, [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard, the 
same party's honorary president and a member of the same 
Balladur government, says he wants an independent PR group.

<F P=106> [Report signed "G.Pa.": "Creation of a Sixth Parliamentary </F>
Group `Suspended'"] 
  [Text] According to the JOURNAL OFFICIEL for 15 June, the 
National Assembly now has a sixth group, the Republicans and 
Independents, formed by 27 deputies who have resigned from the 
UDF [French Democratic Union] group. And yet, no offense to the 
venerable JOURNAL OFFICIEL, this group does not exist. At least 
not yet. It did make an appearance and even had a president 
(Jose Rossi, deputy for Corse-du-Sud) on Tuesday 14 June, but 
only between late morning and the middle of the afternoon.... 
  It was the reading of a letter by Charles Millon, president 
of the UDF caucus in the Assembly, on 13 June which revived the 
tension which appeared after the surprise appointment of 
Dominique Baudis (Social Democratic Center) as head of the 
majority list for the European elections, when Jean-Francois 
Deniau (Republican Party [PR]) was the favorite. At the time, a 
minority of PR deputies had demanded the creation of an 
autonomous group to safeguard the identity of their party, which 
they think is too easily manipulated by UDF President Valery 
Giscard d'Estaing. PR President Gerard Longuet had restored 
calm by postponing this problem until after the European 
elections. 
  A meeting of the PR Executive Committee on 8 June decided to 
postpone this initiative indefinitely, although it has been 
welcomed by the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office], which 
is annoyed by Mr. Millon's criticism and his statements on the 
need for a UDF candidate in the presidential election. Indeed, 
Mr. Longuet wanted to keep the choice of an autonomous group as 
a means of retaliation against Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, in case of 
departures from the rule of a single candidate for the Elysee 
[office of the president], which the PR wants to defend. 
  The PR president wanted to reexamine this hypothesis at a 
meeting with the deputies scheduled for Tuesday 14 June, in the 
afternoon, which was to be the occasion of a solemn appeal for a 
single candidate for the presidential election. Those 
supporting the secessionist line preferred to present Mr. 
Longuet with a fait accompli, thereby speeding things up and 
thus crossing their own Rubicon. It was therefore from a French 
Press Agency dispatch that the PR president, on a visit to 
Lorraine, learned of the creation of the Republicans and 
Independents group. 
<H5>  Decision on 26 June </H5>
  Faced with the chaos and confusion caused by the decision 
made by Jose Rossi and his 26 acolytes, frowned on by the Hotel 
Matignon, Mr. Longuet had to urgently organize a crisis meeting 
at the National Assembly, during which he sharply attacked Mr. 
Millon and Gilles de Robien, who had also spoken out in favor of 
a UDF candidate in the presidential election, and, more 
moderately, the secessionist deputies. 
  After more than two hours of exchanges, Mr. Longuet was able 
to secure the "suspension" of Mr. Rossi's initiative, proposing 
a meeting on 26 June of the PR National Council in order to 
define the party's position within the UDF and in relation to 
the government and the usefulness of the autonomous group. The 
PR members will be asked to give their verdict on Mr. Longuet's 
mandate and on the group's choice, unless this latter decision 
is reserved for the deputies.

<F P=106> [Article by Patrick Coquide: "But Where Have All the </F>
Free Marketers Gone?"] 
  [Text] In the 1980's, 
contemporaneously with Thatcher and Reagan, our free marketers 
enjoyed success and power. Only yesterday they were influential 
ideologues. Have they now become a mere sect--or the victims of 
their own success? Here is a survey of the last of the faithful. 
  Are the free marketers out of fashion? Guy Sorman, the 
patented free marketer, is indignant. "As soon as our ideas are 
no longer challenged and our program has been implemented, it is 
only natural that no one would speak of us any more," he says. 
The impetuous crusader for mass distribution, Michel-Edouard 
Leclerc, does not share this fine enthusiasm. "For a year now 
the masks have been coming off," he says. "The protectionist 
arguments hold sway today. The free enterprisers have gone into 
hiding. To speak of deregulation or of competition has become a 
provocation!" 
  Guy Sorman is not mistaken. Privatization, independence for 
the Bank of France, and elimination of governmental 
authorization for dismissals--all of which the free marketers 
were demanding in the early 1980's--are no longer the object of 
an ideological civil war, even though they have not been 
completely incorporated into our national ethos. Nor is 
Michel-Edouard Leclerc mistaken when he adds: "The right is 
burning its idols. During these past five years it has been 
distancing itself from Reaganism and Thatcherism, and ever since 
it encountered its first popular challenge it has been 
denouncing the excesses of the free-market extremists.'" 
  As a matter of fact, how many political leaders still dare 
to 
call for the privatization of Social Security, the prisons, the 
ANPE [National Employment Agency], or the universities? 
Moreover, those in the current majority who are self-appointed 
advocates of "a different policy"--such as Philippe Seguin--do 
themselves make use of state resources. Here is an anecdote that 
speaks eloquently to this point: in 1985, acting in the name of 
free enterprise, the Center region--led by the UDF [French 
Democratic Union]--eliminated all forms of aid to private 
business. It reestablished them last year, in the name of job 
protection! 
  No one will deny that Balladurism--the heir to 
Pompidouism--is partial to interventionist solutions such as 
political control of the privatized groups and the revival of 
regional planning, which presupposes the effective return of 
state intervention. The upcoming European elections are another 
tangible sign. Of about 10 slates of candidates, not one is 
openly advocating liberal principles. Quite the contrary: the 
Franco-British businessman Jimmy Goldsmith--who yesterday was 
the herald of private enterprise--occupies the second spot on 
the slate of Philippe de Villiers, who himself was once a free 
marketer but today is campaigning for protectionism and against 
the Europe of Maastricht. Worse still: on the eve of the 
elections, indications are that the supporters of European 
social democracy could become the leading political force in the 
new European Parliament, thereby relegating the free marketers 
to anonymity. 
  France is not the only country in which the free-market 
doctrine is losing some of its luster. On the other side of the 
Atlantic, the neo-Keynesians have held sway since the most 
recent presidential election; and in Great Britain the heirs of 
Margaret Thatcher have been devastated by two setbacks at the 
polls. Even the former East bloc countries appear to have 
reneged on their hasty conversion to Western-style free 
enterprise. There is one exception, however--the exception that 
proves the rule: Italy, where Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia 
party is advocating solutions that are Reaganite in inspiration, 
despite the ideological diversity of the coalition that was 
victorious in the most recent elections. As one of the few 
French politicians who have remained faithful to their 
convictions of the 1980's, Alain Madelin was also the only one 
to be pleased at Berlusconi's victory. 
  Even Minister of Enterprises Alain Madelin--although 
deploring the fact--does not deny that the free-market ideology 
has lost some of its attraction. "In a period of economic crisis 
such as the one through which we are passing," he says, "people 
are distrustful of the state while at the same time they are 
seeking its protection." Will a renewal of economic growth 
suffice to reverse the ideological current? The free marketers 
are not naive enough to believe in such a mechanical scenario. 
"Our discourse has been too exclusively economic in nature," 
Madelin adds. "We should henceforth propose reforms not merely 
to achieve efficiency but also to promote justice." He calls for 
"dialogue with a view to reestablishing the free-market 
philosophy." 
  "The 1986-style free-market philosophy rapidly reached a 
limit--the limit of its capacity to persuade the middle 
classes," Herve Novelli declares. "It must do away with the 
elitism professed by the intellectuals." The new UDF deputy for 
Indre-et Loire, who is close to Alain Madelin, has enlisted 
under the banner of a "people's free-market program." It is a 
very comprehensive program indeed! With the creation of his 
Ideas-Action clubs, Madelin promises that by next fall there 
will be a program of this type to deal with issues ranging from 
the problems of the suburbs to medical ethics. 
  The opposition in 1986 went to the voters with a very 
free-market oriented program, which candidate Jacques Chirac 
totally disregarded during the l988 presidential campaign. In 
1993 the right soft-pedaled the free-market views held by one 
segment of its troops. What will happen at next year's 
presidential election? The free marketers are at a disadvantage 
from the very start, because their two principal candidates for 
the presidency, Edouard Balladur and Jacques Chirac, are not 
serving as point men for the free-market cause. "Don't fool 
yourselves," Guy Sorman counters. "To distinguish himself from 
his opposition, Chirac will have to inject a substantial dose of 
free-market philosophy into his program." Could this perhaps be 
mere wishful thinking on Sorman's part? 
<H5>  [Box, p 51] </H5>
<H5>  Politics: Free Enterprise Has Its Supporters </H5>
  If there were only one free marketer left, Alain Madelin 
would like to be that person. Not really in sync with the 
Balladurian policy (unlike his "friend of 30 years," Gerard 
Longuet, who has incorporated a measure of Colbertism 
[protectionism] into his free-market philosophy) and feeling too 
cramped in a not very important Ministry of Enterprises, Madelin 
decided to resume his role as an agitator of ideas. He launched 
his Ideas-Action clubs in a speech he made to an audience of 
political leaders and business executives (not all of whom were 
free marketers, far from it) at a meeting held on 10 March in 
Paris. The clubs were ostensibly designed to serve as the 
intellectual laboratories of the free marketers of civilian 
society and the world of politics (Madelin claims to have 
already converted approximately 100 members of Parliament to 
join with him). On 10 May he opened the first club in Lyons and 
hopes to have 100 opened by next summer. The platform of the 
movement will be formalized at meetings to be held this fall. 
According to some observers, this is a way for Alain Madelin to 
reestablish himself politically in the period leading up to the 
presidential election. 
  With this one exception, the free marketers in the 
government 
are maintaining a conspicuous reserve. Neither the Giscardians 
Herve de Charette and Pascal Clement, nor the attorney Philippe 
Mestre, nor Francois Leotard or Edmond Alphandery have raised 
their voices overmuch to defend their convictions of yesterday. 
Yvan Blot, former RPR [Rally for the Republic] speechwriter for 
Jacques Chirac at the time when the latter was flirting with the 
free-market doctrine, has joined the National Front! As for 
Raymond Barre, he is hopelessly somewhere else. 
  The new activists of the free-market cause are to be found 
instead among the young deputies of the majority who were 
elected in March 1993: for example, Herve Novelli, who followed 
Longuet and Madelin from the extreme right into the Republican 
Party [PR] and supervises the Ideas-Action clubs; Nicolas 
Forissier, the newly elected PR deputy for Indre; Franck 
Thomas-Richard (UDF) in Cher; and Claude Vissac (RPR) in the 
Ardennes. 
<H5>  [Box, p 51] </H5>
<H5>  Business: The Revival of Colbertism </H5>
  Is it symbolic? Despite their differences, the two declared 
candidates for the presidency of the CNPF [National Council of 
French Employers]--Jean-Louis Giral and Jean Gandois--do not 
make excessive use of free-market arguments. Giral is more 
accurately described as a follower of Philippe Seguin's "other 
policy." The employers' pro-free market clubs--such as the 
Enterprise Institute--have been somnolent for a number of years. 
Except for Claude Bebear, PDG [CEO] of Axa; Michel-Edouard 
Leclerc, fierce opponent of the Royer law and the cultural 
exception [in GATT negotiations] Jacques Maillot, president of 
New Frontiers, who argues tirelessly for the deregulation of 
transportation; and Paul Dubrule, co-president of Accor, whose 
pro-free market convictions are firmly rooted, these business 
executives appear instead to welcome governmental 
interventionism. The presidents of the newly privatized groups 
cannot point an accusing finger at the tutelary state, to which 
they are indebted for the executive positions they hold. Worse 
still: for the most part, they are themselves high-ranking 
government officials! 
  Although Jimmy Goldsmith--the former president of Generale 
Occidentale and Groupe Express--insists that he is still a free 
marketer, he has placed his ardor at the service of 
environmental protection and protectionism. His faithful 
follower Rene de Laportaliere--former publisher of l'EXPRESS and 
owner of Libertes Services (a lobbying [preceding word in 
English] firm in charge of preparing ready-to-use free-market 
projects)--is devoting himself to real-estate activities 
involving France and Belgium. Still another newspaper publisher 
who is a well-known free marketer has also disappeared from the 
scene: Alain Lefebvre, who returned to the professional press 
after having launched MAGAZINE HEBDO in the 1980's. 
<H5>  [Box, p 52] </H5>
<H5>  Reflexions: Observations, Wanderings, and Survivals </H5>
  The pro-free market intellectuals continue to be active but 
seem to be living with a nostalgia for the past decade. The 
group of the "new economists"--Pascal Salin, Henri Lepage, 
Florin Aftalion, Jacques Garello, and Jean-Jacques 
Rosa--continues to publish its discussions in the press but is 
reviving issues (such as elimination of the SMIC 
[intervocational minimum growth wage] and deregulation of the 
labor market) that the government seems in no hurry to 
implement. "For several years now, the leading lights of the 
present majority have been disinclined to associate with the 
intellectuals of the Right," is Henri Lepage's bitter comment. 
  This disaffection is serving to deepen the differences. By 
adopting positions on Europe that are not deemed to be very 
free-market oriented, Maurice Allais--"the" French Nobel 
Prizewinner for economics--has fallen out with his colleagues. 
Guy Sorman, author in 1984 of La Solution liberale [The 
Free-Market Solution], who has just published Le 
Capital, suite et fins [Capital: Conclusion] (published by 
Fayard), insists that contrary to the views expressed by 
orthodox free marketers such as Salin and Rosa, the market will 
be unable to solve the unemployment problem in Western 
societies. Sorman even recommends measures that are somewhat 
constraining for private enterprises, in an effort to induce 
them to hire unemployed workers who are in training. 
  Apart from the economists, other intellectuals are preaching 
the good free-market doctrine as it applies to themes "that 
concern society." In the magazine COMMENTAIRES (which he 
publishes)--and in his editorials in L'EXPRESS--the lawyer 
Jean-Claude Casanova calls attention to the timeliness of the 
thinking of Raymond Aron. For his part, the philosopher Philippe 
Nemo--antagonist of our educational system--praises a number of 
free-market experiments in education and the autonomy of 
educational institutions. As the heir to the anarcho-free market 
tradition, FIGARO's editorialist and writer Alain Gerard-Slama, 
who is also a professor at Sciences Po, denounces the new "moral 
order" that involves bans on smoking, speed limits, and 
AIDS-prevention campaigns, all of which are constraints that 
would anesthetize individual responsibility. In short, the 
free-market concept has been broadened--and some will say that 
it has been diluted.

  [Excerpt] Paris, June 16 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur said Thursday [16 June] France would urge its 
European and G7 partners to provide aid that would enable 
Ukraine to shut down the volatile Chernobyl nuclear plant. 
  He said France would call on its partners to help resolve 
the 
Chernobyl "problem" at the European Union [EU] summit on June 24 
and 25 at Corfu and at next month's meeting of the G7 leading 
industrial nations in Naples. 
  The question of closing Chernobyl -- which Ukraine says it 
cannot afford to do unaided -- is on the agenda for both 
meetings. 
  The plant at Chernobyl -- the site in April 1986 of the 
world's worst civilian nuclear accident -- constituted "a very 
serious danger" on safety grounds, Balladur added. 
  The main priority was to "put an end to the production of 
electricty from the Chernobyl plant," he said. 
  "We must help the Ukranian Government to build three more 
modern and risk-free power plants.... That presupposes helping 
Ukraine, whose economic and financial situation is disastrous," 
he said, adding: "Helping Ukraine is a major priority." 
  Balladur stressed that electricity produced at Chernobyl and 
sold in Central Europe was one of Kiev's few assets. [passage

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government will 
support efforts to clearly strengthen Europe's economic 
competitiveness during its EU [European Union] presidency. To 
this end it is to submit, with Great Britain, an initiative on 
increased deregulation in the Union, government spokesman Dieter 
Vogel announced today in the run-up to the EU Council meeting, 
which takes place in Corfu Friday and Saturday [24-25 Jun]. 
  In the debate on the economic situation in the EU, the 
German 
Government will also make demands at the meeting for 
debureaucratization in the EU and for consistent application of 
the principle of subsidiarity, he said. 
  According to Vogel, representatives of the future new 
members: Austria, Sweden, Norway, and Finland will also attend 
the Council meeting and sign the accession agreements. It is 
also expected that the partnership agreement with Russia, the 
talks for which have been concluded, will be signed and sealed 
in Corfu. It has already been reported that President Boris 
Yeltsin himself is to go to Corfu. The government spokesman 
also expressed hope that the matter of the future president of 
the EU Commission will be settled at the Council meeting. 
  At the meeting, the German chancellor will also renew his 
call for Western industrial nations to provide extra resources 
to ensure safety at nuclear power stations in Central and East 
Europe. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Luxembourg Wants Uniform OECD </F>
Regulations"] 
  [Excerpt] Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel has 
announced that he will make a harmonization of tax on interest 
rates in Europe the highlight of Germany's duty presidency of 
the European Union [EU]. He wants a solution that leaves 
national taxation systems more or less untouched, but also makes 
it impossible to avoid the duty to pay tax on the interest one 
earns on one's savings. 
  Those EU countries that already have tax control systems 
should retain them and place their data at the disposal of 
countries that have systems of deducting tax at the source. In 
these latter countries, tax should also be deducted from the 
citizens of other EU countries living there. EU financial 
institutions would be obliged to keep back the minimum tax to be 
paid. In this way, Waigel wants to avoid a split in the capital 
market. 
  As has been the case so far, investors from third countries 
(non-EU nationals) would be exempt from this tax so as not to 
disturb the flow of capital into the EU. Bank secrecy would be 
preserved wherever it exists. Every member country should 
decide by itself whether the tax on interest is to be included 
in income tax, or whether it will exist as a separate measure. 
It should be possible to pay voluntary sums of tax to protect 
smaller investments. 
  A number of OECD countries have already established rules on 
the collection of tax on interest rates. Waigel considers it 
unlikely that there will be an escape of capital sums to exotic 
tax havens as in the Caribbean or Middle East. He also sees no 
danger to stock markets, national economies, or currencies.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The preconditions for establishing 
European works councils in the European Union (EU) could be 
created soon. Fritz Verzetnitsch, president of the European 
Trade Unions Confederation (ETUC), was optimistic following 
talks between an ETUC delegation and Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 
Bonn today that a guideline to this effect will be adopted 
during Germany's EU presidency, which starts on 1 July. 
European works councils are the necessary answer to the 
increasing internationalization of decisions made by big 
companies. 
  At the same time, Verzetnitsch made clear that European 
trade 
unions expect the EU to step up initiatives to combat 
unemployment and to expeditiously adopt a European social 
charter. Europe's social unity is limping behind schedule, he 
claimed. 
  Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said that the chancellor 
and the ETUC delegation agreed that combating unemployment is 
the central task of the EU and its member states. European 
integration must be given a fresh impetus. 
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl confirmed that guidelines on the 
establishment of European works councils, on part-time work, and 
on short-term employment contracts are a high priority for the 
German Government. Great importance is attached to the social 
dialogue with trade unions and employers' associations in the 
European unification process. A Europe geared to people's needs 
requires unions and management who help shape social realities 
in the member countries and in the Community, the chancellor 
stressed.

<F P=106> [Report by Hermann-Josef Tenhagen: "Kalkar Plutonium to </F>
Russia"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- RWE [Rhine-Westphalian Electric Works] AG 
plans finally to get rid of the plutonium-containing remains of 
its fast breeder in Kalkar, which has never been put into 
operation, by selling it to Russia. A total of 123 Mox fuel 
elements consisting of uranium and plutonium, which the 
electrical company in Essen once produced for Kalkar, are to be 
brought to Beloyarsk. Nikolay Oshankov, chief engineer of the 
fast breeder in Beloyarsk in southern Russia, told this 
Greenpeace environmentalists. "This was not our initiative, it 
came from the German experts." 
  Negotiations are under way with the responsible RWE 
subsidiary Fast Breeder Nuclear Power Plant Company (SBK) and 
with Siemens. An RWE spokesman confirmed the contacts: 
"However, the talks are not in a decisive stage." There are 
also contacts with the operators of the Japanese breeder reactor 
in Monju. In addition, the reprocessing and direct final 
storage of the fuel elements is also being considered. 
  At the moment, the fuel elements, which contain 1.2 tonnes 
of 
plutonium, are still stored in the so-called federal bunker in 
Hanau. When it became clear in 1991 that the breeder reactor in 
Kalkar would never be put into operation, the RWE subsidiary SBK 
(RWE share 67 percent) first tried to bring the fuel elements, 
which contain 40 percent of plutonium, to Dounreay in Scotland. 
Breeder fuel elements made in Belgium had already been flown to 
the Scottish nuclear plant in 1991. According to Greenpeace 
information, the SBK even rented storage room in Dounreay for 
1.2 million German marks. 
  But then more and more obstacles emerged for the transport 
to 
Scotland. Despite existing permits by the Federal Government, 
considerable resistance against transporting the plutonium by 
plane developed. The Hesse government did not want to tolerate 
a flight with 1.2 tonnes of the fiendish stuff aboard from 
Frankfurt/Main Airport. And local and land politicians 
responsible for Pferdsfeld, the airport in Rhineland-Palatinate, 
which should have been used instead, also reacted negatively. 
  Second, the fuel elements in the federal bunker in Hanau had 
been radioactively contaminated during a nuclear accident at 
Siemens, which is located in the same building. At first, the 
fuel elements were not permitted to be transported in this 
contaminated state. However, one could not clean them, either, 
because the facility at Siemens has been out of operation since 
the 1991 accident. 
  Now they are supposed to be sent to Beloyarsk. The operators 
of the fast breeder there are pleased. Chief Engineer Oshankov 
told Greenpeace: "The German side supplies us with the fuel 
elements, and we use them in our reactor. And with our 
technology we would finally process the used fuel elements 
further." The reprocessing is to be done in the ailing nuclear 
factory of Mayak near Chelyabinsk in the southern Urals. 
  Oshankov also affirms that the contracts have not yet been 
concluded. The responsibility for potential accidents has not 
yet been clarified. In addition, a bit of reconstruction has to 
be done in Beloyarsk for the German fuel elements. It is 
unclear who is going to pay for the reconstruction. "If we 
reprocessed the German fuel elements, we would no longer need 
the reconstructed facility afterwards," Oshankov says. 
  Yesterday Greenpeace said the planned transfer of the 
plutonium is completely irresponsible. Fire broke out in the 
14-year-old BN-600 breeder reactor in Beloyarsk in October and 
May because of leaks in the cooling system. Each time 
radioactivity was released. And plutonium for the 
Soviet/Russian nuclear weapons program was produced in Mayak 
until 1992. In 1957 a nuclear waste container exploded in the 
plant. Thousands of square kilometers of land and several 
hundreds of thousands of people were contaminated with 
radioactive elements.

<F P=106> [Report by "eli/mes": "Geissler Warns of Growing </F>
Nationalism"] 
  [Text] Heiner Geissler, acting chairman of the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] faction, has issued a warning about 
increasing nationalism and a return to thinking in nationalist 
terms. In an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, he said that 
nationalist thinking has moved to the forefront since 
unification. But, he said, Germany's future lies not in the 
reestablishment of a national state, but in opening up to other 
ideas, and in the creation of a federal European structure. "A 
national state is too little for big things and too big for 
little things," he said. 
  With his statements, Geissler confirmed similar opinions by 
CDU politicians recently expressed at the traditional 
"Roemeberg" talks in Frankfurt. The CDU had reacted with some 
concern to these opinions because Wolfgang Schaeuble, 
CDU/Christian-Social Union [CSU] chairman, wrote in his book 
that the nation's thoughts must be filled with vitality to 
prevent society from drifting apart. Schaueble's book is to be 
presented by Chancellor Kohl this Monday [20 Jun]. 
  Geissler said that although he agrees with Schaueble that 
society is splitting up into groups, "nationalist feelings as a 
collective ethnic emotion cannot be considered the basis of 
collective responsibility. One must love one's neighbor, not 
one's people." 
  "The citizens of East Berlin and Leipzig did not create the 
revolution in 1989 to reestablish the nationalist state, but to 
push through democracy, freedom, and justice," Geissler 
continues. "But, in 1990, the center of gravity changed. 
Nationalist feelings moved to the forefront." Although equality 
and justice still form the mainstays of internal unity, "we will 
never attain them by means of nationalist feelings, but by means 
of a feeling of responsibility toward one's fellow man," said 
Geissler. 
  Geissler does not think the CDU is full of nationalist 
sentiment. "Were it not for Helmut Kohl, the situation would 
certainly have been more difficult," he says. Geissler does not 
think it is necessary to seek an identity in Germany. "That is 
an artificial task. Nationalist feelings are good only if they 
are premeditated and restrained. The idea of nationalism has 
been discredited, and rightly so. Nationalism is an ideological 
plague, just like fundamentalism, fascism, and communism." 
  Geissler calls for "unity, justice, and freedom, instead of 
Germany above all else. When the flag flutters in the air, 
one's mind lies in the trumpet that blows the fanfare," he says. 
"The patrons of the new Germany are not Kaiser Wilhelm or Otto 
von Bismarck, but Konrad Adenauer, Willy Brandt, Richard von 
Weizsaecker, and Helmut Kohl."

<F P=106> [Report by Karl-Ludwig Guensche: "FDP Is a Danger for Kohl"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- According to the latest analyses of the 
Dortmund opinion research institute Forsa, the FDP [Free 
Democratic Party] is in danger of running afoul of the 5-percent 
threshold in the Bundestag elections. Even though the liberals 
are currently still getting 5 percent of the votes, the party is 
in acute danger. 
  This assessment was given by Forsa chief Manfred Guellner to 
DIE WELT. In his view, the FDP is developing into the sole 
source of danger for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, since the Christian 
Democratic Union /Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] is constantly 
rising in the voters' favor. 
  In Guellner's view, Chairman Klaus Kinkel is to be blamed 
for 
the problems. Before his election as party chairman, the FDP 
had a stable nationwide reservoir of voters of about 9 percent. 
Afterward, the party slid down to 5 to 6 percent. It has not 
been able to make good this "negative Kinkel effect" again. 
  In particular, its attitude at the presidential elections 
has 
caused great damage to the FDP, according to Guellner. In the 
week after Herzog's election, it fell to 3 percent all over the 
country for the first time, because the voters no longer saw the 
FDP's election behavior as an independent decision. 
  Forsa also gives bad marks to Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping. "Today, he is already 
as weak as Oskar Lafontaine was in 1990 during the final stage 
of the election campaign." In this respect, Chancellor Kohl 
need not fear his challenger anymore. 
  According to the Forsa analysis, the decline of the SPD has 
been caused by the bad presentation of Scharping's tax plans. 
Guellner: "This was perhaps the decisive turning point from 
which the SPD and Scharping have never recovered." 
  In contrast to his internal party rival, Gerhard Schroeder, 
Scharping did not symbolize the competent SPD for the voters 
that they wanted. This means: "Because Scharping is so weak, 
Kohl is so strong again," the election researcher explains. 
  While the Greens get a stable 9 percent, according to 
Guellner's polls, the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] could 
become the second surprise of the Bundestag elections, apart 
from the FDP. After the European election, there are signs that 
the successor of the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] is 
also gaining followers in the west. The PDS has "good prospects 
to get three or more direct mandates." If the SPD grows even 
weaker, the PDS could jump over the 5-percent threshold at the 
national level, Guellner predicts.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister and FDP Chairman Klaus </F>
Kinkel by Einar Koch; place and date not given: "Mr. Kinkel, 
Are You Afraid of the Bundestag Elections?"] 
  [Text] Defeat in the European elections, failure to cross 
the 5-percent threshold in Hamburg and in Lower-Saxony -- BILD 
asked Free Democratic Party [FDP] Chairman Kinkel: Are you 
worried about the Bundestag elections on 16 October? 
  [Kinkel] No! After the lost European election everybody in 
our party now knows what is at stake. Now we must fight back 
rather than complain. We are fighting for each and every vote. 
Without a strong FDP it will not be possible to continue the 
liberal-conservative coalition after 16 October. The 
alternative is: red-green -- or at least something just as bad: 
a grand coalition. 
  [Koch] How does the FDP want to manage to get into the next 
Bundestag? 
  [Kinkel] We are entering the election campaign with our own 
tax concept. We want to ease the tax burden on the citizen and 
the economy. This means that the solidarity surcharge must be 
reexamined after three years with the goal of abolishing it 
completely or at least reducing it gradually. 
  [Koch] What about tax reductions? 
  [Kinkel] Payroll and income tax must be reduced at all 
levels. Private households must be recognized as employers. 
Trade capital tax and property tax for companies must be 
abolished completely. This must be discussed in government 
negotiations after the elections. 
  [Koch] Social Democratic Party [SPD] Deputy Chairman Thierse 
does not rule out a social-liberal coalition from the outset.... 
  [Kinkel] The SPD is completely out of step. A debate about 
a red-green coalition cannot be silenced anymore. The initial 
upswing in the polls was false euphoria. Just before its party 
congress the SPD's leading team is not exactly personified 
confidence in victory.

<F P=106> [Interview with FDP Bundestag Group Chairman Hermann Otto </F>
Solms by Friedemann Weckbach-Mara; place and date not given: 
"Fiscal Policy: FDP Seeking Row With Union"] 
  [Text] [Weckbach-Mara] The government coalition has not 
managed to agree on a joint tax concept for the next few years. 
It is not just the opposition that now suspects that taxes will 
go up after the elections.... 
  [Solms] If the FDP [Free Democratic Party of Germany] forms 
part of the government again, there will certainly be no tax 
increases. The tax burden is too high already. That is why we 
are going to make fiscal policy our central issue in the 
election campaign. In contrast to the Christian Democratic 
Union /Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and the Social 
Democratic Party [SDP], the FDP will make sure that the tax 
burden on citizens is not increased, but lowered. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] But there are billions missing in the 
budget, and the next tax increase, the solidarity surcharge, has 
long been agreed.... 
  [Solms] We will gradually abolish the solidarity surcharge, 
in three years at the latest, and the federal budget will be 
balanced through determined saving. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] Would you risk a row with the Union on the 
issue of fiscal policy? 
  [Solms] We will make clear demands for a future coalition. 
And we will not be deviated from that by the CDU/CSU's election 
program. In the new laender, tax reliefs, such as the temporary 
abolition of property and trade capital tax, must be maintained 
after 1996. In addition, we demand that the value-added tax on 
products from the new laender be lowered to facilitate their 
launch on the markets. We will continue to promote savings with 
building societies, and we will even double income ceilings, 
especially for families with children. And we want to support 
investible wage agreements in employment contracts. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] Are there any other potential problems with 
the CDU/CSU? 
  [Solms] We insist on a consistent debureaucratization. This 
means fewer authorities, fewer ministries, and 
performance-linked salaries for civil servants instead of 
automatic promotion. And we demand a reform of the educational 
system. As a first step the duration of schooling up to the 
final exams should be reduced to 12 years. University education 
should be divided into two parts. First, there should be a 
shorter, profession-oriented basic course of studies. And those 
who want to go on after that would have to prove certain 
achievements. 
  [Weckbach-Mara] This looks like comprehensive amendments to 
laws, even constitutional amendments. 
  [Solms] Yes, we also want specific constitutional 
amendments. One of the things we demand is for animal protection 
to be included in the constitution. I even expect that we will 
be able to get this aim adopted in the Bundestag and Bundesrat 
before the Bundestag elections.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Ziller: "To the Pinnacles of Wealth"] </F>
  [Text] Next weekend, the Alliance 90/Greens want to 
sharpen their profile as a reform party that is also able to 
participate in the government at the federal level. At a 
meeting of the Land Council -- the highest body that meets 
between the federal delegates' assemblies -- they want to 
discuss 10 "turning points" in Magdeburg. With these they will 
enter the election campaign and, later on, perhaps the coalition 
talks. FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU correspondent Peter Ziller talked 
about the touchstones with Ludger Volmer, one of the two 
Executive Committee spokesmen of the Greens. 
  Volmer has had a few pleasant days. The "unexpectedly good" 
result of the European election was followed by an appearance at 
the DGB [German Trade Union Federation] federal congress, where 
the 42-year-old man felt "unconcealed sympathetic feelings" 
coming from the delegates. For the sociologist, who is 
considered a member of the left wing, the Greens are now the 
third political force. 
  The turning points suggested by the Executive Committee do 
not mean a correction of the Mannheim election congress. No 
wing of the party wants that, Volmer says, rejecting the 
suspicion that is emerging here and there. What was decided at 
the end of February must, however be "explained and detailed" in 
some fields. Thus, the demands often have a different time 
scale. In Magdeburg, the Greens now want to make clear what 
kind of "change in direction" they consider feasible and 
indispensable within one legislative period. 
  In Volmer's view, not only some media but also the desired 
political partner, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], 
have misunderstood the Greens' decisions. "In contrast to the 
widespread rumors, our goal is not the immediate abolition of 
the Bundeswehr and departure from NATO." He says that the 
Greens rather want a "diplomatic initiative for the dissolution 
of the military blocs in a system of collective security." This 
cannot be achieved by a one-sided act, which has been agreed on 
in a coalition agreement. "After all, we know that our remote 
foreign policy goals can be only the result of years of 
diplomacy." In the turning points, his party describes what is 
possible soon: for instance, the strong reduction of the 
military service, the renunciation of German crisis intervention 
forces, and new projects for the acquisition of armament goods. 
  However, the Greens are putting other issues in the 
foreground. The first four turning points are aimed at the 
ecological restructuring of the economy, the lack of jobs, the 
situation in the new laender, and social policy. "We need a 
courageous reform policy -- and reforms are expensive." 
Therefore his party says that new sources of money must be 
opened up. Rudolf Scharping's "safety-fence concept," which 
rejects higher taxes and debts and says that reforms are carried 
out only if it is possible to finance them, extends the "policy 
of muddling through," in the view of the Greens leader. "There 
is a great deal of money in Germany," Volmer says. He includes 
the high private capital incomes, the high liquidity of the 
companies, and inherited assets. "We want to get to the 
pinnacles of wealth"; the broad population benefits from 
tax-free amounts and is not burdened additionally. 
  However, the consumers are not spared ecological taxes. The 
higher petroleum tax, for instance, which is to rise by 30 
pfennigs per year, will not be generally compensated for by the 
reduction of other taxes, Volmer affirms. The increase is to 
make the consumers buy energy-saving products and to change the 
structure of industry's range of products.

<F P=106> [Report by `deu': "Scharping Announces New `Eastern </F>
Policy'"] 
  [Text] With a new "Eastern policy," the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] wants to extol the private initiative of 
citizens more strongly and support their social commitment. At 
a meeting in Bonn with several hundred representatives of 
private civic groups that are rendering practical assistance to 
East Europe, SPD chairman Rudolf Scharping criticized the 
government for limiting itself to the organization of transfers 
of money. "The result of this is that rich advisers are staying 
in poor countries," he said. Scharping pointed out that to 
eliminate the vicious circle of escape and deportation, "East 
Europe must not be wasted away economically, socially, and, 
above all, philanthropically. My party's aim is to strengthen 
the involvement of private citizens in the Federal Republic." 
  The representatives of the private aid initiatives 
complained 
about the government's bureaucratic obstacles to their work. 
Some of these obstacles have actually induced a few charitable 
organizations to discontinue their work, it was said. There are 
new customs and tax rules all the time, and even applications 
for a reimbursement of the costs of transporting aid are brushed 
aside in Bonn. "In the GDR, old vehicles are rusting away that 
are urgently required in the south of Europe," was another 
complaint from a participant in the meeting. For six months, 
some of the charities have been waging a "private war" with 
ministries in Bonn to acquire a well-worn ambulance to send to 
Romania. "There is a lot we could do, but we cannot do anything 
without the proper infrastructure," one woman complained. 
Scharping mentioned the possibility of deploying the Bundeswehr 
to deliver aid to East Europe. Apart from that, the Bundeswehr 
should make out of date equipment available for East European 
aid. Finally, in every recipient country there should be 
coordination units to relieve the charitable organizations of 
the burdens of bureaucracy. 
  SPD Bundestag Deputy Gernot Erler complains that the 
government was doing next to nothing in the elimination of 
nuclear and chemical weapons in Russia. "The destruction of 
these weapons agreed to in the treaty is not possible on account 
of absent technology. While the United States has offered the 
Russians 1 billion marks [DM] in aid for the process of 
disarmament, Bonn has offered them all of DM10 million," says 
Erler.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lower Saxon Minister-President Gerhard </F>
Schroeder by Wolfgang Kaden and Klaus Wirtgen; place and date 
not given: "`Too Miserable'"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schroeder, almost exactly three 
months after your election victory as minister-president for 
Lower Saxony, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
suffered its worst setback in a long time in the European 
elections. Do you have an explanation for this? 
  [Schroeder] I have two. The SPD did not manage to mobilize 
all the voters who are within its reach and failed to make it 
clear what the issues of work and social justice have to do with 
Europe. Moreover, the election campaign left a lot to be desired 
on substance and even more so aesthetically. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What was it that you did not like? 
  [Schroeder] The election posters and the motifs were too 
dull. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You are probably referring to the man who.... 
  [Schroeder] .... is sleeping in a boat, and who, when you 
look at him, creates the impression: "Socialists do not really 
want to work hard." I did not like the "mafia" poster, either. 
After all, we cannot compete with the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU] as far as law-and-order slogans are concerned, let 
alone -- thank God -- win the election. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Scharping has decided that the SPD would 
support a law that permits the bugging of private homes in 
specific cases. He is obviously taking a different view on this 
issue from you. 
  [Schroeder] I supported Scharping's positions on the bugging 
issue and the asylum law. Yet I find it hard to understand that 
the SPD should make a classic CDU topic its number one issue in 
an election campaign. This criticism is not directed against 
the person and the position of the chairman. We all made a 
mistake here that we should have avoided. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Whom are you referring to in particular? 
After all, you are also a member of the Presidium, the highest 
leadership circle. 
  [Schroeder] So they say. So what I have said can also be 
understood as self-criticism. However, these decisions were not 
made in the Presidium. Had I known about the posters, I would 
have said: They are not good enough. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You were speaking of the voters whom the SPD 
could not "mobilize." How big a percent can the SPD win? 
  [Schroeder] Clearly more than 40 percent. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So how do you explain that the SPD remained 
below this level even in Lower Saxony and fell behind the CDU? 
Were you not active enough in the election campaign? 
  [Schroeder] I did my job, but only 52 percent of the voters 
turned out in Lower Saxony. Nevertheless, the SPD achieved 39 
percent. Under the circumstances "also a nice result." 
  [DER SPIEGEL] With his focus on "work, work, work," will 
Scharping be able to reach new groups of voters? 
  [Schroeder] Work and protecting jobs are government issues. 
Only as head of government can one be present and helpful when 
things are bad at the enterprise level. At the abstract level 
of demands these issues are only very difficult to represent in 
a credible way. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So is this topic not suitable for the 
Bundestag elections? 
  [Schroeder] For the presentation of the opposition in the 
Bundestag the topic of jobs is appropriate only to a limited 
degree. This is why the SPD must point to the successful work 
done in this sphere by all its minister-presidents and use it as 
proof of its specific authority in industrial policy. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you, in all seriousness, think that this 
group of land leaders could beat Kohl? 
  [Schroeder] The fact that with Oskar Lafontaine a most 
successful minister-president is responsible for the economy and 
finances has certainly increased our competence. Everything is 
fine in the Saarland.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...apart from the magisterial press law.... 
  [Schroeder] ...apart from the press law -- and Lafontaine 
only lost marginally in the election. It may make sense if we 
treat the issue of "work" in the election campaign as concretely 
as we minister-presidents are dealing with it. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you insinuating that the SPD has so far 
focused too much on Scharping and not presented itself as a team? 
  [Schroeder] I cannot put it like this because, owing to my 
commitments in Lower Saxony, I am not available for the team. 
Yet, maybe the SPD could make it clear that, although it has a 
chairman and a candidate, there are a number of people next to 
or behind him who also know a thing or two. In all modesty, I 
do count myself among this group of people. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you, maybe, have the feeling that you are 
not sufficiently respected by Scharping, who defeated you in the 
poll held among SPD members a year ago? 
  [Schroeder] It is not a question of vanity. He who wants to 
get more from me than I did -- with my people I won an election 
in Lower Saxony -- has to tell me so. I want Scharping to win 
the election because of the party and because of his person. We 
used to be rivals, but we are not now. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Many people do not quite believe you on that. 
  [Schroeder] The SPD decided about its leadership at the 
grass-roots level in an exemplary way. To start a debate on the 
leadership now would be the silliest thing that the SPD could 
do. I will certainly not take part in such a debate, out of my 
own understanding but also out of fear of a threat from my 
friend Oskar, who said he would give anyone a thrashing who 
started such a debate. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Would you think it a good idea if the SPD 
were to depict you together with Scharping and Lafontaine on one 
poster? 
  [Schroeder] I would have absolutely no problem. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What slogan would you recommend? 
  [Schroeder] "The Magnificent Three" I would write cheekily. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] "Negligence in our own club" is what Scharping 
partly blamed the defeat on in the European elections. Do you 
feel that this refers to you, too? 
  [Schroeder] Not at all. I have been most discreet, even on 
issues -- such as the question of a statement in favor of an 
SPD-Greens coalition -- where everybody knows that I am of a 
different opinion. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You do not have to pretend to appear to be 
more harmless than you are. After all, you must have known that 
your cheeky remark that the SPD should not constantly invent new 
contenders -- you mentioned Federal President Herzog; Stihl, 
head of the Federation of German Chambers of Industry and 
Commerce [DIHT]; and the coach of the national soccer team, 
Vogts -- was exactly aimed at your superior, Scharping. 
  [Schroeder] We do not have superiors, only a chairman. It 
was not intended as criticism of him. After all, I could have 
added a fourth one, who is not a contender either, namely myself. 
  I wanted to give an informal ad hoc interview. I am sorry if 
the wrong impression was created. Still, we should not make the 
mistake now of hiding the real problems behind the irritation 
created by my interview, which was the only interview that I had 
given in many months. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The real problem: Despite the almost 4 
million unemployed and extremely high state debt, the SPD has 
not managed to strip the government coalition of its majority. 
Can you still win the Bundestag elections? 
  [Schroeder] Yes. If Kohl had reacted in as cowardly a way 
to setbacks in the last two years as my party has now, he would 
long since be gone. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So should Scharping defy all setbacks? 
  [Schroeder] Our message must remain the same. There is no 
doubt that an upswing has set in. Yet, it is much too miserable 
to say that this upswing has had an effect on the labor market. 
We must become more precise and make it clear that only an 
ecologically acceptable production of goods can create 
additional jobs. We must make it clear to the people that, now 
as then, the lowest third of wage-earners are financing the 
costs related to unity in a ratio of 4:1. These messages, 
combined with the results of the achievements of the 
minister-presidents and an attractive election campaign team, 
are the recipe for success. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Even with a man at the top who has been so 
badly damaged? 
  [Schroeder] It is most remarkable and it can terrify even a 
man with a skin as thick as I have how quickly the "Hosanna!" 
has turned into a "Crucify him!" The praise for our party 
chairman is still ringing in my ears. Now it is painful to hear 
how the same man is being turned into the opposite within a few 
days or even hours, even though he has not changed his policy. 
I cannot be had by such games. I do not think that we cannot 
win the Bundestag election with Rudolf Scharping. On the 
contrary. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Scharping is seeking voters from the center. 
Can they be filled with enthusiasm for ecological thinking? 
  [Schroeder] Certainly. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Should Scharping now change to Schroeder's 
course and come out in favor of a coalition between the SPD and 
the Greens? 
  [Schroeder] No. It would have been fatal for Scharping had 
he followed such public advice. The candidate must determine 
the strategy to a great extent. Otherwise he cannot fight and 
"campaign on the streets and squares...." 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...You are now quoting Helmut Kohl.... 
  [Schroeder] ...Those who now feel that they have to advise 
Scharping to change his course to the one that Schroeder pursued 
in Lower Saxony and endorsed last year are giving him bad 
advice. A political strategy must fit a person and must show 
continuity, even in the moment of defeat. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you, all of a sudden, also regard the 
SPD-Green coalition as an inadequate perspective for power to 
succeed the CDU/CSU/FDP [Christian Social Union/Free Democratic 
Party] coalition? 
  [Schroeder] Not me. Yet the SPD has more than one option. 
As is demanded by our federal party manager, Guenter Verheugen, 
it can rely on several opportunities. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Could you please explain what has so far been 
the one option of your party? 
  [Schroeder] The SPD had the option to work in a coalition 
with the FDP. After all, there is one constant factor in German 
policy, namely the relentless opportunism of the FDP. If they 
cannot avoid it, they will come crawling on their stomachs into 
our hut to enter into a coalition with the SPD. The SPD's 
strategy has tacitly built on this assumption. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Was that the strategy of the SPD or Scharping, 
who, in Rhineland-Palatinate, rules together with the FDP. 
  [Schroeder] These strategies are identical. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But it was never your option, and you are SPD, 
too. 
  [Schroeder] It is right that he who has been defeated with 
his strategy sometimes keeps his mouth shut. After the election 
we will opt for the one coalition with which we will most likely 
be able to implement our reform program. For me the answer is 
not difficult, while for others it is more difficult. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] At the party congress in Halle on Wednesday 
[22 June], Scharping is to be nominated as the official 
candidate -- in a secret ballot. Is that not somewhat risky? 
  [Schroeder] I thought that it was correct and noble of 
Scharping to ask for a secret ballot. The SPD's collective 
common sense will certainly be enough -- at least in Halle. The 
delegates will realize that Scharping must not simply give in to 
all these demands for change that he is now being confronted 
with. Yet, the concept for victory also includes that we now 
discuss in public what we can do better. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Many people within the SPD suspect that 
Gerhard Schroeder is only waiting for his chance to replace 
Scharping at the very last minute. What answer have you 
prepared for this interview to deny this? 
  [Schroeder] I do not have to deny anything, because I have 
had one experience: Regardless of what I do or fail to do, 
people will always interpret it as if I wanted something. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schroeder, thank you very much for this 
interview.

<F P=106> [Report by "ban": "Scharping Reiterates His No to a </F>
Statement Favoring the Greens"] 
  [Excerpts] Bonn, 19 Jun -- A few days before the party 
congress in Halle, SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] 
Chairman Scharping has once again emphasized that in his view 
the SPD should not make any statements favoring a coalition with 
the Greens before the Bundestag elections. That is how 
Scharping has responded to continued demands to that effect from 
the party's left, which expressed these demands in a resolution 
passed at the SPD district congress for South Hesse at the 
weekend. The congress, which reelected party Deputy Chairman 
Wieczorek-Zeul as district chairman (with, of course, only 69.5 
percent compared to 82 percent at the previous election) came 
out in favor of a statement on a red-green coalition at the 
federal level. Scharping, on the other hand, warned against an 
"uncritical" attitude on the part of the SPD vis- a-vis the 
Greens that signaled a lack of confidence. [passage omitted] 
  In a whole series of conversations, SPD Deputy Chairman 
Thierse said that the SPD would not pursue a "coalition election 
campaign." People who want a change of government have to vote 
for the SPD. Everything else will be determined by negotiations 
and closeness on political matters. Thierse did, however, make 
it clear that the Greens were closer to the SPD than the FDP. 
He also warned against holding a discussion about Scharping's 
leadership. "That would lead to political suicide." Speaking 
to the WELT AM SONNTAG, Parliamentary Manager Struck of the SPD 
Bundestag Group and a member of Scharping's closest team of 
advisers said: "The SPD should not and will not conduct a 
coalition election campaign. The party's goal must be to 
prevent the formation of an opposing government." 
  Speaking at the party congress in South Hesse, Federal Party 
Manager Verheugen sought to win support for his proposal that 
Scharping should present his shadow cabinet before the end of 
July. The delegates responded with applause. Verheugen said 
that the SPD must quickly show that the SPD can provide a 
"wealth" of politicians who can get things done, in contrast to 
the Federal Government. Until now, Scharping has said that he 
will make a decision by the end of August at the latest. 
According to reliable sources, Scharping was not pleased about 
his federal manager's excessive haste. 
  At a meeting of the "Seeheim Kreis," which is close to the 
trade union movement, SPD Bundestag Group Chairman Klose said he 
regretted that SPD statements on foreign policy made it easy for 
the Federal Government "to strike a pose of being solid on 
foreign policy and push us into the corner in terms of foreign 
policy." The SPD must comprehend that the concept of defense 
covers more than national and Alliance defense and "that, at any 
rate, is the way that our Alliance partners see things." If the 
party insists on maintaining its current standpoint, it will 
make things difficult for itself. The SPD has unnecessarily 
placed itself "in a corner" and thus given the Federal 
Government a chance to divert attention from its own lack of 
ideas. Klose also criticized the fact that the SPD has based 
its election campaign strategy on a prolonged economic crisis 
for too long. "We cast ourselves in the role of killjoys of our 
own making if we deny that the economy is picking up and only 
peddle bad news." This makes it easy for the Federal Government 
to "paint a rosier picture of reality from its point of view." 
Lower Saxon Minister-President Schroeder also said that "there 
is no doubt at all that we are experiencing an upturn."

<F P=106> [Article by Joachim Geiger: "The SPD's Fear of the Voter"] </F>
  [Text] Rudolf Scharping wants to become chancellor in 
the fall. But five months before the Bundestag election, the 
Social Democrats are losing confidence that they can take power 
this time. 
  So that there will be no doubts, Rudolf Scharping says it 
again and again: this fall the SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany] wants to supersede the Kohl government and take over 
responsibility in Bonn. By this he naturally means a change of 
power. But the chancellor candidate is not so fond of the term 
"power." Somehow power sounds like an end in itself and somehow 
that does not fit in the self-understanding of the SPD. For a 
Social Democrat, political content comes first and then power. 
  Seen in this way, it was only logical for Rudolf Scharping 
to 
react angrily to the election of Roman Herzog as federal 
president. Anyone who believed that it was necessary to elect 
the most suitable candidate as head of state must be especially 
disappointed that power-policy considerations alone decided the 
issue. 
  But this understandable human disappointment also involves 
an 
imcomprehensible political naivete. After 12 years of experience 
with power politician Helmut Kohl, had the Social Democrats 
really thought that he would not put the liberals under massive 
pressure? And does Scharping, who in his initial anger 
characterized the FDP [Free Democratic Party] as superfluous but 
then quickly called it a conceivable partner in the government, 
seriously believe that there is another criterion for the Free 
Democrats than participation in power? 
  It is one thing to criticize Kohl's instrumental 
relationship 
to power. It is another thing to change the political power 
relations. In his short time as chief of the SPD, to be sure, 
Scharping was able to maneuver his party out of the corner into 
which the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union] had pushed it with remarkable adroitness. But he was only 
able to do this because the SPD largely took the course of the 
Union in the dispute about the right of asylum, fighting crime, 
and UN missions of the Bundeswehr. And the attempt to make the 
fight against unemployment the focus of the election campaign 
and thus to put the Bonn coalition on the defensive got bogged 
down at the very start. 
<H5>  The Most Dangerous Adversary of the Social Democrats Is the </H5>
Social Democrats 
  First, in his, in principle, correct and honest attempt to 
put a greater burden on the higher incomes and in exchange to 
abandon the planned solidarity surcharge for everyone, Scharping 
got entangled in the definition of the so-called higher earners. 
Then Oskar Lafontaine reaped sharp criticism from his own ranks 
for his likewise correct and honest statement that the social 
expenditures must also be subject to review if it is a matter of 
the consolidation of the budget. After the election for the 
federal presidency, in turn, the party chief presented himself 
as a poor loser. And finally, in the vote in the Bundestag on 
the abortion paragraph 218, even renowned Social Democrats were 
conspicuous in their absence. Instead of utilizing this 
politically meaningless but symbolically important vote to give 
a defeat to the governing coalition, the parliamentary group of 
the SPD itself suffered a beating. 
  It appears that the Social Democrats are the most dangerous 
adversary of the Social Democrats. Six months before the 
Bundestag election, Chancellor Kohl and his Union once again see 
themselves on the rise in opinion polls, just as the head of the 
government had prophesied when the mood was worst at the 
beginning of the year. Meanwhile, the confidence of many members 
of the SPD that this time they can win the election is yielding 
to the feeling that they will once again be losers. 
  What are the reasons why the opposition is not able to 
profit 
politically from the battered image of the Federal Government? 
  The party certainly does not lack unity. The ideas about 
reform are also quite consistent, at least in their 
fundamentals. Lower taxes on labor and higher taxes on energy 
consumption, tax relief for investments, and consolidation of 
the national budget--all of these are proper goals. But so far 
the Social Democrats have answered the key question in a 
fragmentary way at best: How is this to be financed? 
  If the Social Democrats were honest, they would have to 
declare that for a few years all groups in society must tighten 
their belts so that later on things can again get better for 
everyone. And if they were courageous, they would be very 
specific about naming the demands that are necessary to resolve 
above all the most pressing problem of this society: the 
unemployment that can no longer be eliminated through economic 
growth alone. 
  Certainly there is a justifiable fear of thereby offending 
voters. But what is the benefit of Scharping getting the 
approval of socially weaker groups by offering them relief if he 
also angers all those who by no means count themselves among the 
higher earners but are supposed to pay higher taxes? And when 
Lafontaine, in turn, calls for review of all social payments, 
which at best gets the applause of employers? In terms of 
election tactics, the two things really do not go together. But 
do they not fit together into a plausible total concept? 
  What is lacking is not so much tactical skill but rather a 
consistent election campaign strategy. For this reason, although 
reconciled in the party program, three positions of the SPD 
stand side by side: 
  --the position of social fairness, which certainly needs 
correction after 12 years of Kohl's policy of redistribution 
from bottom to top; 
  --the national position, which sees itself as participating 
in the government on the basis of its majority in the Bundesrat 
and which is therefore oriented toward what can be done in the 
short term, toward economic interests and the restraining of the 
national debt; 
  --finally the visionary position, which wants to achieve new 
jobs through an ecological restructuring of the industrial 
society through fundamental reforms of the basic conditions in 
the state. 
  So far the Social Democrats have not been able to present 
these three positions as indispensable components of a single 
reform process. 
  For one thing, that is because different politicians of the 
SPD express themselves on different details without truly making 
the connection clear. Second, individual Social Democrats still 
see themselves more as representatives of certain groups of 
voters rather than as advocates of a comprehensive overall 
concept, as is shown by Christoph Zoepel's reaction to 
Scharping's bloated statement on the speed limit or Rudolf 
Dressler's protest against Lafontaine's position on social 
outlays. And third, the leaders of the SPD made the mistake of 
thinking that they could vie for the sympathy of business 
associations and conservative media. 
<H5>  Successful Public Relations Work Looks Different </H5>
  The SPD could copy Helmut Kohl in particular in dealing with 
the media and managers. The fact that the chancellor avoids the 
media that are critical to him has not hurt him in any election. 
And although he might grumble, he absorbs criticism from 
business associations. Rudolf Scharping, on the other hand, 
reacted to the--probably expected--warning of Heinz-Peter Stihl, 
president of the DIHT [German Industrial and Trade Association], 
against the Social Democrats with a letter of several pages to 
the entrepreneur. Out of understandable personal irritation, 
Oskar Lafontaine, in turn, put through a totally 
incomprehensible law in the Saarland Parliament to restrict 
freedom of the press. That is not what successful public 
relations work looks like. Are the Social Democrats unable to 
realize this? 
  At the present time, the chancellor candidate and his most 
important aspirant for minister are turning out to be not very 
sovereign. And if any comprehensive strategy of the Social 
Democrats is recognizable, then it is to make themselves as 
unassailable as possible from the conservative side. This, 
however, certainly gives rise to doubts about how serious the 
party really is about reforms. Meanwhile, one can hear Rudolf 
Scharping talk almost more about what he would like to preserve 
as head of the government, whereas incumbent Helmut Kohl is 
talking about fundamental change. 
  If one believes Guenter Verheugen, general secretary of the 
SPD, then the speculation about the specific ideas of his party 
is quite intentional. Verheugen is calling for the people to be 
patient, saying that the veil will be lifted on 4 September. At 
that time a detailed 100-day program will be presented for the 
takeover of the government. Until then the motto will be: there 
is much to do, let us wait and see.

  [Text] Wiesbaden (DDP/ADN) -- Industry in the former GDR 
only contributed 2 percent to total German exports last year. 
At 12 billion marks, exports only reached 30 percent of 1989's 
level, the Federal Statistical Office announced in Wiesbaden 
today. 
  The office said the political and economic changes in the 
former Eastern Bloc states were responsible for the fall in 
exports. Exports to these countries had dropped to 20 percent of 
the level of 1989 but still made up 52 percent of eastern German 
exports.

<F P=106> [Interview with Federal Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer </F>
by Fritz Vorholz and Christian Wernicke; place and date not 
given: "`I Want To Try It at Least'"] 
  [Text] [DIE ZEIT] Minister, are you going to resign in the 
next few days? 
  [Toepfer] Why would I? Certainly not. 
  [DIE ZEIT] You just took on an important post with the 
United 
Nations: you were just elected chairman of the Commission on 
Sustained Development [CSD]. Can this mammoth task be done on 
the side from Bonn, as it were? 
  [Toepfer] That is an honorific title. And I can quite 
readily 
combine it with the job of environmental minister of the Federal 
Republic of Germany. But, of course, it requires lots of 
concentration, coordination, and a good staff. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Environmental and developmental groups from many 
countries take quite a different view. They fear that the 
commission's work could trickle away through the sands, if you 
do not meet the new challenge with all your energies. 
  [Toepfer] There is, clearly, the danger that the results of 
Rio could be lost. On all sides, there is the concern that the 
Commission on Sustained Development is not in a position to 
advance the principles and the cause of Rio. Many, especially in 
the developing countries, are convinced that the CSD has 
accomplished too little in its first year. 
  [DIE ZEIT] The chairman of the UN General Assembly even 
thinks that the decisions of Rio, and the partnership that was 
concluded there between North and South, have long since been 
forgotten. 
  [Toepfer] For precisely that reason, there would have been 
many good reasons for saying: Even I cannot change it. But would 
that be the proper conclusion? Either the matter is left to 
trickle through the sands, or an attempt is made, 
wholeheartedly, with all the risks that that entails, and small 
chance of spectacular successes. But at least I want to, I must, 
try to change this trend toward resignation. 
  [DIE ZEIT] That sounds very optimistic. What do you intend 
to 
do? 
  [Toepfer] The Rio process, that is to say, the partnership 
that has been forged between north and south, must be advanced 
honestly and substantially. At the present time, we are holding 
one conference after the other. In September, the World 
Population Conference is slated for Cairo, then there is the 
World Social Summit in Copenhagen, then the Women's Summit in 
Beijing, and so on--all events with a clear reference to 
sustained development. But it must not come to pass that we rush 
from one summit to the next, only to determine, in the final 
analysis, that we are marching without a compass, without any 
internal guidelines, without a common goal. Up to now, the 
brackets between the conferences have been missing. 
  [DIE ZEIT] How do things stand with the often-cited global 
partnership between north and south? 
  [Toepfer] For the developing countries, to an ever greater 
degree, the tough consequences of the conflict between East and 
West that has been overcome, are becoming apparent. In former 
times, the north helped--in the East as well as the West, and 
they did so, in part for strategic considerations; playing the 
competing systems, one against the other, brought them 
developmental opportunities, and material assistance. That is 
missing now, and the poorest of the poor are suffering because 
of it. Then, too, the long, deep recession in the industrialized 
countries has been a factor, as has the economic break-up of 
Central and East Europe. 
  [DIE ZEIT] So, you want to procure more money for the poor 
countries? 
  [Toepfer] That plays quite a central role in the case of the 
developing countries, of course. We must see what will become of 
the "new and additional funds" that were decided upon in Rio. 
There are positive signals, but it is also clear that because of 
the economic problems in the donor countries, the monies are not 
being made as readily available as the developing countries 
correctly thought they would be in Rio. But it is not just a 
matter of money; there is also the matter of transferring 
technology, administrative assistance, and opening up the 
markets. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Little is coming, even from Germany. In Rio, the 
chancellor promised 780 million German marks [DM]. When it came 
time to pay, not even DM400 million was left. 
  [Toepfer] It is correct that we, too, have to come to terms 
with the economic break-up, but by no means have we sent out the 
signal that we are getting out of the global partnership, which 
is based on solidarity. 
  For the future, the question whether we develop and conclude 
innovative financial instruments will be an important one. The 
developing countries are calling for international taxes, a 
supplement on airfares, for example, which would then be 
funnelled to them. Matters of this type will occupy us at the 
CSD. 
  [DIE ZEIT] What would be more significant than small gifts 
are open markets. 
  [Toepfer] That is how things stand right now. To be sure, 
due 
to low raw material prices, the developing countries, in 
particular, are suffering from the weakness of the world 
economy. In Rio, we missed the opportunity to talk about trade 
issues. Now, it is quite important not to disappoint anyone. The 
positive conclusion of the GATT negotiations provides a very 
good basis for this. 
  [DIE ZEIT] And yet, Europe unabashedly limits the 
importation 
of bananas from Latin America. 
  [Toepfer] That was and is, truly, a signal in the wrong 
direction. And we must not arouse the suspicion that, under the 
cloak of environmental policies, we want to establish new trade 
barriers. Some politicians from the Third World are already 
fearful that even eco-labels, like our blue environmental angel, 
are signs of a green imperialism, as my Indian colleague, Kamal 
Nath, has said. Environment and trade, therefore, are issues 
that will keep us intensely busy. They are a very hot topic... 
  [DIE ZEIT] ...about which the World Trade Organization will 
be occupied as well. 
  [Toepfer] But we cannot simply leave it to trade policy. For 
example, in the UN Commission for Sustained Development, we 
shall soon be dealing with matters of forest policy. In Rio 
itself, the best we could do was agree on a few nonbinding 
principles. Now the matter is beginning to pick up some 
momentum. Think of Greenpeace's action against Canadian wood. 
Something like that is effective. And so the question is raised: 
What is sustained forest use? And, we must allow the question to 
be put to us why we do we want to dictate to other countries 
what they may do and what they may not. It is just the same with 
social policy. We want neither social nor environmental 
dumping--others want no hindrances to trade outside the 
constraints of the rates insofar as environmental or social 
standards are concerned. We must take care that our efforts on 
behalf of environmental policy are not misunderstood as a 
barrier to our own benefit. 
  [DIE ZEIT] But how is that done? 
  [Toepfer] I can give you an example: a German cement 
producer 
recently told me that at present, the cement from our Eastern 
neighbors is delivered at prices that are lower than the cost of 
the wages he must pay in Germany alone. One reason for this is 
the lack of environmental surcharges in Eastern Europe. His 
proposal was: let us collect an import duty that does not 
disappear into our coffers, with the help of which the eastern 
cement plants can be retrofitted. Considering something of this 
sort is urgently needed at the CSD. In Rio we decided that 
trade, the environment, and sustained development must be 
mutually supportive. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Can you actually imagine such a form of 
partnership? 
  [Toepfer] Certainly. By decreasing emissions of carbon 
dioxide, which are harmful to the climate, we want to do 
precisely that: the industrial countries promise to stabilize 
their emissions, or better yet, to reduce them by a certain 
amount, as we decided, in Germany's case, to reduce them by 25 
to 30 percent. For what the industrial countries do together 
with the developing countries beyond that to curb carbon 
dioxide, they must, to some degree, be given credit. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Let us remain with the threat to the world's 
climate. The International Energy Agency predicts that the 
wealthy OECD countries, by the year 2010, will spew out 
approximately 30 percent more of the greenhouse gas carbon 
dioxide. That is in diametrical opposition to what was decided 
at Rio. 
  [Toepfer] That stands in particular opposition to the Rio 
climate convention, which is binding from the standpoint of 
international law, and which, in the meantime, 68 countries have 
ratified. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Evidently, that is not worth much. 
  [Toepfer] From the standpoint of international law, it is 
binding! But it is all the more important that now all the 
industrialized countries must get to work; for example, that we 
in the European Union [EU] not only decide to stabilize carbon 
dioxide emissions, but that we also provide the instruments for 
doing so. 
  [DIE ZEIT] The carbon dioxide/energy tax. 
  [Toepfer] That is a must... 
  [DIE ZEIT] ...concerning which Brussels fights continually. 
  [Toepfer] There are precisely five reasons for that. The 
southern Europeans say that the northern Europeans--that means 
we Germans, too--with their high per capita carbon dioxide 
emissions, should reduce these emissions and bear the cost 
associated with doing so. Others say: if a tax at all, please, 
only a carbon dioxide tax--whereas the critics see in that an 
instrument for the promotion of nuclear energy. The third point 
is the so-called conditionality: the EU should become active 
only if the OECD countries--Japan and the United States in 
particular, do something. The fourth group argues: with a tax of 
$3 per barrel of oil, there will be no reaction at all insofar 
as demand is concerned, and for that reason, it should be left 
alone. And finally, the argument that the introduction of new 
taxes is a matter that should be left to the member countries. 
Things get hung up at that point and nothing moves. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Because, to put it quite simply, the political 
will to do anything is lacking. 
  [Toepfer] That, among other things, certainly plays a 
decisive role. And that is why I agree with my French colleague: 
what is not done in this area in the next 12 months in the 
EU--Germany, then France, will hold the EU presidency--probably 
will not be done so quickly. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Toepfer, we have the impression that your 
election to the chairmanship of the CSD was a belated thank you 
for your involvement at the Rio conference. Your colleagues in 
Bonn seem to be less grateful. 
  [Toepfer] How do you arrive at that conclusion? 
  [DIE ZEIT] Think of your struggle against the superstition 
that environmental protection costs jobs. 
  [Toepfer] It is sometimes enervating. That is true. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Think of your promise to fight the climatic 
catastrophe. In the old laender, carbon dioxide emissions have 
even increased slightly since 1987. 
  [Toepfer] They increased from 715 to 716 million tons, which 
is to say they have remained virtually constant. At the same 
time, however, the population in the old laender has grown by 
circa 7 percent. That means that in terms of per capita emission 
of carbon dioxide, we have had a definite decrease. 
  [DIE ZEIT] So you still believe you can keep your promise to 
decrease carbon dioxide emissions by 2005 by 25 percent with 
reference to 1987 levels? 
  [Toepfer] If we can manage to control the growth process in 
the new laender with the emissions level that has been achieved 
at present--incidentally, this level is, per capita, still above 
that of the old laender, then we shall have 15 percent less 
carbon dioxide than in 1987, the base year for our reduction 
obligation. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Ten percent is still lacking. 
  [Toepfer] By way of a variety of important measures, these 
can still be reached: by way of the thermal utilization 
regulation, by way of traffic-related measures, all the way to 
the thermal protection regulation... 
  [DIE ZEIT] ...which a leading producer of building materials 
has already characterized as "outmoded" before it was even 
passed. 
  [Toepfer] I tend to be rather grateful for such criticism. 
It 
proves that legislative regulations are still being undercut, 
but we also need the European carbon dioxide/energy tax. And we 
need a European provision for limiting carbon dioxide emissions 
from cars with the average of at most five liters per 100 
kilometers. I agree with my French colleague that we shall 
tackle the problem together if the commission does not soon 
present a draft. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Toepfer, why would you not rather tackle your 
task in New York wholeheartedly, and rid yourself of the 
albatross that is hanging around your neck here? 
  [Toepfer] The new job, naturally, has much to do with the 
fact that I perform a function in Bonn on the national level, 
that we are held in esteem in terms of environmental policy 
worldwide. 
  [DIE ZEIT] And your frustration threshold has not yet been 
crossed? 
  [Toepfer] No. Quite the contrary. Even if one stands in the 
midst of criticism in such a fascinating time of historical 
changes, that does not mean that one has not moved anything or 
that one has advanced nothing. And, in New York, I shall have to 
face the question again and again how I do my homework. That is 
the most important basis, even for credibility on a worldwide 
scale.

  [Text] Spanish sources in Washington told Radio Nacional 
that the military junta in Haiti could be granted political 
asylum in Spain if the United States were to request it. 
President Bill Clinton has admitted implicitly that one of the 
possible solutions for the current crisis in Haiti -- and its 
return to democracy -- would be that the military leaders who 
took part in the coup d'etat be exiled in Spain or in France. 
Our correspondent in Washington Luz Rodriguez has the story. 
  Spanish sources have confirmed to Radio Nacional de Espana 
that our country would be willing to receive the three Haitian 
military leaders for which the United States is looking for a 
golden exile. 
  The leaders they are talking about are Commander in Chief 
Raoul Cedras; Michel Francois, the head of Port-au-Prince 
police; and Philippe Biamby, the chief of Army general staff. 
  We have not been able to confirm that the United States has 
made a formal request to Madrid because it is still not clear 
whether the three Haitian leaders are willing to go into exile 
even though this exile would be in the best of circumstances. 
The aim of this operation would be to allow the return of Jean 
Bertrand Aristide.

<F P=106> [Report by Xavier Ventura: "CiU Believes That Results Force </F>
It To Continue Support for Government to Even Greater Extent"] 
  [Text] The Convergence and Union (CiU) liaison committee 
yesterday expressed its great satisfaction at the results 
achieved by the coalition in the elections to the European 
Parliament and reaffirmed its view that it is not necessary for 
Felipe Gonzalez to submit a confidence motion following the 
defeat of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party [PSOE] and the 
People's Party's [PP] victory. To this effect, Miquel Roca said 
at the end of the committee meeting that an end must be put to 
the speculation about a possible confidence motion or an early 
general election: "People cannot continue to speculate with a 
constant electoral atmosphere," asserted Roca, for whom 
yesterday's result seems to have no consequence for 
parliamentary support for the government. 
  As Jordi Pujol had already stated Sunday [12 Jun] evening, 
the CiU leaders yesterday assessed the results as a clear 
endorsement of the nationalist coalition's support for the 
government, and Roca even asserted that because of "our voters' 
mandate, as reflected in the results," CiU "is now much more 
obliged than before" to continue the same state policy. "The 
PSOE will do whatever it thinks fit, but we have already 
confirmed our intention to continue to support the government," 
Roca continued. Nevertheless, in his opinion, CiU's support 
depends on "the government's maintaining its intention to 
strengthen the economic policy that we have promoted and its way 
of tackling autonomy policy," he said. Roca added that the 
agreement with the government on autonomy policy is at the 
"final stage, not just of negotiation but of finalization," and 
he hopes it will be completed within the next few days. 
  The view that Sunday's results endorse CiU's political 
activity in both the European and state spheres and in Catalonia 
was one of the points discussed by the liaison committee, which 
also emphasized that the coalition has achieved its aims, which 
were to win in Catalonia for the first time in other than 
autonomous community elections and to win back the third seat 
that it held between 1987 and 1989. The liaison committee also 
considered the fact that CiU's victory has a balanced 
distribution throughout Catalonia, since the coalition prevailed 
in the areas of Tarragona, Lleida, Girona, and Barcelona. 
  The victory with a lead of almost 9 percent over the 
Socialist Party of Catalonia in the city of Barcelona is of a 
special nature for CiU, which Miquel Roca highlighted in saying 
that following this result "we have the greatest hope and 
confidence of success" in next year's municipal elections. Both 
Roca and Democratic Union of Catalonia [UDC] leader Josep Antoni 
Duran Lleida expressed the desire for the pact between the two 
parties for these local elections to be signed before the 
summer, although some sectors of Democratic Convergence of 
Catalonia [CDC] would prefer an internal debate on relations 
with Union to be conducted before the agreement is concluded. 
  The disagreements between the two parties on the 
organization 
of the campaign, which Union made clear and which culminated in 
the angry walkout by all its leaders at the end of Sunday's news 
conference, at which Duran Lleida was not called on to speak and 
at which some Christian Democratic leaders had problems in 
gaining entry to the hall, were raised formally by Union at the 
liaison committee meeting. The two parties decided to draw up 
reports separately and then call a restricted meeting in order 
to study them, but while UDC wants this to be done this week, 
CDC does not feel the same urgency. Convergence sources told 
this newspaper that there was not the slightest mistake in the 
campaign, contrary to what Union believes, and attributed any 
possible shortcoming to the large number of meetings which CiU 
held during that time. 
  Duran Lleida explained his sudden walkout from the 
election headquarters by stating that "if the interpretation of 
the results was made by the CDC secretary general, thanks were 
given by the CDC candidate, and the political analysis was made 
by the CDC chairman, it is clear that it was a very appropriate 
news conference for a party but not for a coalition." Duran 
Lleida, who stated a few days ago that he felt "uncomfortable" 
in having to support the Socialist Party, said yesterday that 
his stance had not changed, "although I can feel rather more 
pleased following the victory in the European elections," but he 
demanded a gesture by the PSOE to show that it wishes to 
continue to have CiU's support. 
  Jordi Pujol, who would make no statement at the end of the 
liaison committee meeting, later asserted in an interview 
broadcast on TV3 at 1200 that the People's Party "cannot afford 
the luxury of lapsing into fanaticism, intransigence, and 
anti-Catalanism," because this would have "unforeseeable 
consequences" for the country, referring to the insults against 
the Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] premier made by 
PP supporters celebrating the conservative party's victory in 
Madrid. "The language, culture, and whatever affects 
Catalonia's national identity take priority for CiU, and 
everybody should know that we cannot be counted on for anything 
without taking this into account," Pujol stated in the interview. 
  Despite this, Pujol expressed his desire and confidence that 
the People's Party leadership will lay down a policy totally 
different from what could be deduced from those shouts: "I 
expect People's Party policy to be dictated not by a few 
hotheaded and anti-Catalan people but by people with a sense of 
responsibility," he said, asserting that the party "will be in 
the Spanish Government some day or other." He also reiterated 
that CiU suffered no erosion in these elections because of its 
support for the Socialist government, and that "if it depends on 
us and if the policy we demand in the economic and autonomy 
spheres is pursued, we will maintain our line."

<F P=106> [Article by Francesco De Vito: "We'll Give Europe a Good </F>
Thrashing: Antonio Martino Goes to War"] 
  [Text] Old Pietro Nenni, who had a good understanding of 
foreign affairs, liked to define the Foreign Affairs Ministry as 
"the political ministry par excellence." During the formation of 
Silvio Berlusconi's cabinet, however, it was the Interior 
Ministry and the Institutional Reforms Ministry that were 
bitterly contested, whereas no one's feathers were ruffled when 
Antonio Martino was nominated for the post of foreign 
minister--someone who until that moment had been presented not 
as a shrewd politician but as the economic expert of Forza 
Italia. 
  The fact is that during the entire election campaign--and 
until one week before the announcement of the new 
cabinet--Martino was reputed to be Berlusconi's economist and a 
disciple of Milton Friedman, who provided the inspiration for 
the economic policy initially of Augusto Pinochet and 
subsequently of Ronald Reagan. Martino's statements had dealt 
exclusively with taxes and financial strategies. He made only 
one incursion into foreign policy (and that was not until the 
first week in April) to brand as "stupid" Furio Colombo's 
contention that the presence of neofascists in the cabinet would 
cause great concern in countries friendly to Italy. This 
miscalculation by the future foreign minister was no less 
serious than the one he made regarding tax rates--a mistake that 
threatened to damage the credibility of Berlusconi's campaign. 
Someone more familiar with the world of diplomacy would not have 
shrugged off the comments that for several months had been 
appearing in the most influential organs of the foreign press, 
and would have understood the warning issued by Beniamino 
Andreatta--Martino's predecessor at the Foreign Ministry--when 
the electoral pact with Gianfranco Fini was impending. "Any more 
or less technical agreement with the National Alliance," 
Andreatta said, "will be interpreted by the press and 
governments throughout the world as an extremely ominous 
indication of a 180-degree reversal in Italian foreign policy." 
Martino, however, chose to continue believing that these were 
self-serving warnings and superficial judgments that resulted 
from unhealthy fraternization with the foreign correspondents in 
Rome. 
  There are two versions as to why Martino was rerouted away 
from the Treasury Ministry (the cabinet post to which he seemed 
predestined) to the Foreign Ministry--a move that was announced 
only one week before installation of the cabinet. The first (and 
most malicious) version alleges that Berlusconi's decision was 
based on the fear that Martino's ultra-free market views--if 
implemented without any gradualism--could cause uncontrollable 
damage. Franco Modigliani found this argument convincing and 
commented: "Yes, it is better that Martino be confined to the 
Foreign Ministry." A second (and kindlier) version holds that 
the prime minister suddenly remembered that Martino was the son 
of a foreign minister: his father Gaetano had served in that 
capacity from 1954 to 1957, as a representative of the Liberal 
Party. Moreover, the fact that Antonio Martino has an American 
wife, Carol, and speaks perfect English without any Sicilian 
accent probably convinced Berlusconi that no one could direct 
Forza Italia's diplomacy better than he. 
  Be that as it may, Martino quickly assumed his new role. 
When 
asked the reason for the transfer, he replied: "I am not 
embarrassed to say that Berlusconi values me and is aware of the 
need to strengthen our foreign policy." He painted a 
self-portrait in which he defined himself as a liberal in his 
politics, a free marketer in his economics, and a libertarian in 
his private life. Then--moving from paradox to paradox--he added 
five more definitions: conservative, radical, reactionary, 
revolutionary, and progressive. He announced that his first trip 
will be to the United States, and the second to Israel, "to 
explain that it is not true that the fascists have returned to 
power in Rome." He acknowledged, however, that his explanation 
would be more persuasive if no one from the MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] had been included in the cabinet. "A foreign diplomat 
even told me so," he says. Lastly, he announced a policy 
which--when implemented--will immediately bring about a crisis 
in relations with Slovenia and Croatia. First, Slovenia cannot 
enter the European Community unless it dismantles its frontier 
with Croatia. Second, before entering the Community, Slovenia 
and Croatia must return the property of the exiles. Third, Italy 
must be accorded a form of protectorate over Istria. A certain 
slogan [preceding word in English]--often used by Martino--that 
contains the word "country" or "state" has taken on greater 
significance, because these words are now often replaced by the 
word "power." 
  The world press, too, is also wondering at this point about 
the orientation that the new occupant at Palazzo Farnesina 
intends to impart to Italian diplomacy. In Brussels, the unease 
caused by the inclusion of neofascists in the government has 
been heightened by the demand for more influence as a nation as 
opposed to a willingness to do more to accelerate the process of 
European unity. The fear is that adoption by Italy of the 
positions taken by Great Britain could lead to a deceleration of 
that process. Two influential press organs express this view. 
"Mr. Martino," THE ECONOMIST writes, "is the closest thing to a 
Euroskeptic that you will find in Italy. His ideas with respect 
to the free market, his suspicions regarding the bureaucracy in 
Brussels, and his opposition to the methods used to establish a 
monetary union, could for the first time place Italy on the 
British side in the European debate." And LE MONDE adds: "His 
reputation is that of an ultra-free marketeer who is critical of 
the concept of a single currency and, in general, is mistrustful 
of the Europe-building effort."

  Instead of to Washington, therefore, Martino's first trip 
was 
to Brussels, on the same day that Berlusconi asked for the 
confidence of the Senate. In the Eurocapital, rather than 
seeking to dispel these fears, Martino did some things that had 
the immediate effect of intensifying them. He gave complimentary 
copies of a 1992 essay of his--an essay very critical of the 
Maastricht Treaty and the single European currency--to the 
Italian ambassadors accredited to the countries of the 
Community, almost as if to prompt them concerning the new 
orientation. His most cordial meeting was with British Foreign 
Minister Douglas Hurd. "We determined that there is a lot of 
room for Anglo-Italian cooperation within the Community 
organization," Hurd announced. This was matched by the coolness 
of Jacques Delors. "Experience has taught me," he said, "to 
judge on the basis of deeds, not words." 
  In Washington--his second stopping place--Foreign Minister 
Martino introduced himself with a calling card that sounded 
blasphemous to anyone who believes strongly in the market but 
also in the rules. "Sometimes the written rules are less 
effective than the unwritten ones," he declared, adding: "In the 
USA the antitrust regulations, by hindering the mechanisms of 
competition, often produce results the opposite of those 
intended." Then, under the banner of self-aggrandizement, he 
requested a seat on the UN Security Council and a post in the 
"contact group" that is monitoring the Bosnian crisis. He 
received a courteous refusal of his requests. It was his good 
fortune that the Americans are more pragmatic than the 
Europeans--and also less interested in the plan to achieve 
strong political unity in Europe. Several days later Bill 
Clinton in effect opened a line of credit for Berlusconi with 
the words, "Let's give him a chance." 
  The third stopping place was Paris, on the day the 
controversy with French President Francois Mitterrand was 
raging. A foreign minister who is aware that he must rebuild the 
image of his country would take the trouble to activate all the 
diplomatic channels with a view to setting up a schedule of 
direct meetings with his European counterparts. Martino did not 
do this even with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, and in a 
gesture of retaliation also did not attend the dinner given by 
Mitterrand at the Elysee Palace. 
  The most serious crisis, however, is the one involving the 
Slovenes and Croats. Martino reaffirmed the veto of Slovenia's 
candidacy for membership in the European Community until such 
time as bilateral problems are resolved. And because retaliation 
calls for retaliation, his counterpart in Ljubljana, Lojze 
Peterle, replied: "If Italy wishes to reopen disputes inherited 
from communism, we will be entitled to reopen disputes inherited 
from fascism." Even sterner was the reaction of Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman, who said: "We are confronted by an 
Italian imperialism and irredentism that are attempting to link 
up with the Serbian aspirations." 
  In the course of his peregrinations Antonio Martino attempts 
unsuccessfully to calm his interlocutors by saying that in the 
new government "there are five cabinet ministers from the 
National Alliance, which is different from the MSI, which in 
turn is not the Fascist Party." Every day reports arrive in 
foreign capitals that appear designed precisely to refute his 
statement. One day it was the appointment of Mirko Tremaglia, 
who fought in the service of the Republic of Salo, as chairman 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. 
Another day it was the Berlusconi interview in which the prime 
minister rehabilitated Mussolini in first-rate fashion. Still 
another day it was a bill endorsed by Fini that would extend to 
the combatants of the Salo Republic a status similar to that 
accorded the Italian Army. 
  Germany and France are accordingly keeping their distance. 
Norway has refused to meet with neofascist ministers. Belgian 
Vice Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo refused to shake hands with 
Italian Deputy Prime Minister Giuseppe Tatarella. Greek Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreu announced that all that has been done 
is still not enough. Perhaps, with the passage of time, this 
pressure will ease. There remains a mistrust, however, of a 
foreign policy orientation that apears to be a strange mixture 
of improvisation, mini-de Gaullism Italian style, and 
nationalistic chauvinism. 
  Piero Fassino, in charge of foreign affairs for the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left], met with Martino both before and 
after Martino's appointment and judges him to be "a gracious and 
pleasant person" but views the foreign policy that Martino is 
carrying out as "a factor for destabilization." "For him," 
Fassino declares, "the problem is to create a single European 
market, and the rest--political unity--is a hindrance. In 
relations with Slovenia, therefore, he is conditioned by the MSI 
people and by some sectors of Forza Italia." Beniamino 
Andreatta, now the chairman of the PPI [Italian Popular Party] 
deputies, avoids making personal judgments of his successor in 
the Foreign Ministry but says of the Forza Italia people, "They 
are carrying out a nationalistic campaign, because they are 
obsessed with the desire to show their muscles."

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance Secretary Gianfranco Fini </F>
by Alessandro Caprettini in Rome; date not given: "Fini: 
`United So as Not To Lose Votes'" --first paragraph is 
L'INDIPENDENTE introduction] 
  [Text] No message, perish the thought, but [National 
Alliance, AN leader] Gianfranco Fini does have a suggestion for 
[League Secretary] Bossi and the people of the League, who will 
be holding their rally at Pontida today: "Look ahead.... Stop 
steering by the stars, otherwise you run the risk of losing your 
bearings." And if there is one thing that the AN leader wants 
to avoid, it is this government running onto the rocks. If 
anything, his dream is of the executive going from strength to 
strength and a close pact between Forza Italia, League, and the 
AN. 
  [Caprettini] Is it a single majority party that you would 
like to see emerge, Fini? 
  [Fini] I see a single party as a difficult goal to achieve, 
almost impossible, at least for the time being. But I think 
there is a case for forming a single electoral group. Take the 
local elections: Some second ballots have the AN and Forza 
Italia versus the League. These are wasted opportunities. The 
same thing happened in the general election. We lost out. 
Meanwhile, they have made a deal on the Left.... 
  [Caprettini] [Interior Minister] Maroni seems willing to 
consider your proposal, but not Bossi. Do you see signs of a 
split in the League? 
  [Fini] No. I think they are speaking different languages 
owing to the fact that Maroni is working to strengthen the 
majority from his position as a minister, while Bossi is 
claiming greater freedom of action as secretary. The main thing 
is for them not to start playing clever.... 
  [Caprettini] How do you explain Bossi's sorties? 
  [Fini] He is going through an unsettling period, with the 
election defeat in a lot of northern towns, such as Verona and 
Como, and the break with Miglio, which has left his federalist 
flank very exposed. Then, above all, he has a strategic 
problem. Until 26 March it was easy for him to present himself 
as an alternative to the system.... 
  [Caprettini] You are making allowances.... 
  [Fini] No, it is just that I understand what he is going 
through at the moment. I respect the man who has come to a 
crossroads. 
  [Caprettini] But, now that you know him better, what do you 
think of Bossi? 
  [Fini] He says what he thinks. He is not at all 
"constructed." The speeches that he is giving at the moment are 
an admission of the crisis that the League is going through. 
However, my comment is that it is important for them to choose 
a course of action once and for all, looking ahead and avoiding 
clever tricks and antics.... For instance, I do not like his 
launching the idea of an independentist current within the 
League when he knows perfectly well that there is a definite 
government agreement on the unity of the state. His 
announcement of a labor party with a nudge and a wink to the 
Left, while even Maroni was tugging at his sleeve, strikes me as 
out of place. I appreciate that he feels caught between the 
devil and the deep blue sea, but I should like to understand 
what his real intentions are. 
  [Caprettini] Will he make them clear at Pontida today? 
  [Fini] I will be interested to see, but I do not have great 
hopes. These rallies usually serve the purpose of galvanizing 
the grass roots. His appeal will be more to party pride. 
  [Caprettini] Bossi fears Berlusconi, but you do not. Why 
not? 
  [Fini] The identity of the AN is now well established. For a 
couple of months, we sailed through a storm of allegations, but 
we confirmed our strength in the European elections, and in many 
cities, such as Rome, we have maintained our leading position. 
This is why I do not fear deals with Forza Italia. 
  [Caprettini] But Bossi would have none of it.... 
  [Fini] True, he justifies his stance on the grounds that the 
League has to defend its identity. I remember I told him: "You 
can get away with it in the European elections, where there is 
proportional representation, but you will be running an enormous 
risk in the local elections." The outcome has proved me right, 
even leaving aside the fact that where there are AN and Forza 
Italia candidates in the second ballot, the League's electorate 
will end up by opting for us.... 
  [Caprettini] Are you quite sure? 
  [Fini] Sure I am sure! The majority of the League's 
electorate does not have a labor-voting soul. These are people 
who voted for the League because it was the sole representative 
of free-market tendencies. What is more, was Maroni not 
supposed to be the party's left wing? And is he not the 
staunchest supporter of the three-way electoral deal? 
  [Caprettini] Meanwhile, however, there is friction between 
AN 
and the League as regards regional electoral reform.... 
  [Fini] Yes, and here I must put my foot down. [Institutional 
Reform Minister] Speroni and the League must not think that they 
can solve their problems by offloading them onto the government. 
Regional electoral laws? Impossible, not least because the 
regional governments elected in 1990 still have parties that 
have since been wiped out in positions of strength, while other 
parties -- such as Forza Italia -- are not represented. What 
needs drafting, therefore, is a national bill, maybe framework 
legislation.... But it is inconceivable that it should be 
others -- some of them dead and buried -- who decide. 
  [Caprettini] What should be done about reforming the 
parliamentary election system? 
  [Fini] Here we must remember that [Radical leader] 
Pannella's 
referendum is just around the corner. So what should we do? 
Either we draft a bill or we go ahead with the referendum. And 
if the choice should be the British system, how can we avoid 
confronting the issue of an electoral deal at least within the 
majority? Because it strikes me as obvious that, in either 
case, we shall have to go back to the polls....

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F>
Carlo Brambilla in Milan; date not given: "But Bossi Swears to 
`Bobo's' Loyalty"] 
  [Text] [Brambilla] Honorable Bossi, are you still 
determined to hoist the neo-Laborite flag? Many in the League 
no longer seem to understand you.... 
  [Bossi] The definition may create some embarrassment. Let me 
reexplain: We invented the Freedom Alliance, which we conceived 
as being a liberal-democratic alliance. Well, it won the 
election, as did free enterprise which became its system. In 
this system there are two irreconcilable spirits. The 
conservative one, which already exists and is represented by 
Forza Italia and the AN [National Alliance], which is pushing 
toward private monopolies, and the popular and federalist one 
which embraces small shareholdings and the defense of small 
business. This is the neo-Laborite spirit. In order to make 
free enterprise win, we worked out how to enter but also how to 
get out. Having paid the toll we are now out of [Prime 
Minister] Berlusconi's orbit. After tactics we will return to 
strategies.... 
  [Brambilla] This is where the difficult part begins. Is it 
sufficient to say that you are left-wing to make yourselves 
recognized? 
  [Bossi] With its values the League has lit a strong beacon 
toward the world that is disintegrating and that must be 
reaggregated under free enterprise. Let us not forget that 70 
percent of the votes lies in that stormy night sea. Therefore 
it is not a matter of stating that we are left wing. The League 
is a popular force that has lit the beacon of federalism and 
free enterprise. Those who do not think so do not belong to the 
League but to Berlusconi. 
  [Brambilla] In light of what has been said, what will 
relations with the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] be like? 
  [Bossi] The alliance that is governing and that will have to 
govern for at least another two years until a real alternative 
has been created, is a system with a well-defined dialectic 
between the two spirits and not a single party pushing us toward 
Forza Italia as Berlusconi would want. In this way the merger 
of the forces in the alliance would lead to the creation of a 
single party given the fact that no other politicians outside 
the alliance are currently able to object. This would 
constitute a danger for democracy. Therefore I insist: We will 
set small business against Fininvest, federalism against 
centralism and so on.... 
  [Brambilla] [Interior] Minister Maroni does not seem to 
think 
along the same lines.... 
  [Bossi] It does not appear to me that Maroni has a single 
party in mind. This story over differences was invented by the 
newspapers. I spent most of the other evening with him in Rome. 
We talked about a great many things.... And the only 
difference that I noted between him and me was that he had the 
flu. 
  [Brambilla] This may even be so, but Maroni insists on an 
organizational agreements between the League-Forza Italia and 
the AN.... 
  [Bossi] Let us cut the Gordian knot.... Berlusconi invited 
me to be the secretary of that jumble. I said no. I answered 
that the League will never be able to do what Berlusconi wants. 
The League has never dabbled in the previous regime. The 
League means change. We have a different ideology: We are 
popular, free traders, and federalists. Our blood is fiery, it 
is not blue blood. Therefore no single party in Italian 
politics. 
  [Brambilla] Well then, quarrels with Berlusconi are in 
sight.... 
  [Bossi] We are not the ones who are quarreling with 
Berlusconi, it is history that is quarreling with someone who is 
reasoning with the logic of "I will take everything." 
  [Brambilla] Is the Knight focusing on early elections for 
this reason? 
  [Bossi] Yes, so much so that the day after the European 
elections he went to [President] Scalfaro to ask him to dissolve 
parliament. But elections now, without having completed 
everything that must be done within the framework of a 
well-balanced democratic system, is an adventurist and dangerous 
choice. 
  [Brambilla] Could you provide a picture of the current state 
of the League.... 
  [Bossi] We are a car that is running again. We have paid the 
toll and we have entered into the highway of strategy again. 
Every 100 meters we will try to accelerate at least 20 
kilometers an hour. The finish is at the end of the road. The 
finishing tape reads: free enterprise and federalism. Change is 
starting up again.... 
  [Brambilla] You are confident then. And what will you say at 
Pontida [League rally venue]? 
  [Bossi] Everything that I have illustrated up to this point. 
I will explain the strategy, furthermore I will explain that 
the League knocked down the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and 
that it is now beginning to make the PDS [Democratic Party of 
the Left] waiver. And that therefore, for the time being, it is 
guaranteeing a governable situation provided that there is no 
stop to change. Then I will open the issue of the independentist 
faction.... 
  [Brambilla] What does this mean exactly? 
  [Bossi] The federalists and the independentists are the two 
spirits of the League. The first is flourishing within the 
country. It is already ahead. The other is still against the 
country. Coexisting in this way without any prospects there is a 
risk of reciprocal destruction, of unleashing an immunilogical 
reaction.... The independentist component must be given a 
political conscience, I must lead the way.... 
  [Brambilla] But will they both be part of the League.... 
  [Bossi] An internal dialectic will be created. I will be its 
guarantor. A dialectic that will make federalism become the 
common good for the whole country. I can say that the 
independentist faction was not created up to now because many 
militants stalled in order not to displease me. Now they must 
all be conscious of their own role. Every difference must 
emerge.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Alberto Cavallari: "European Left's Slow </F>
Decline"] 
  [Text] They were not European elections but 12 "local" 
elections. Europe did not issue a supranational vote, but 
merely vented confused and conflicting national feelings. It 
did not debate or choose its destiny but rewarded or punished 
governments and opposition forces within the context of its 
regional borders. Moreover, it voted apathetically, 
disenchantedly, without enthusiasm, despite the good news about 
the Austrian referendum. Of its 266 million voters, 54 percent 
abstained. 
  It is possible to agree with this theory, which has appeared 
in the American newspapers, and thus explain the difficulty of 
forming a truly European assessment of the elections. Overall, 
the right-wing forces advanced, but the Socialists still remain 
the largest parliamentary group in Strasbourg. Nationalist 
extremism was defeated (the Republikaner in Germany, Le Pen in 
France) but the adversaries of the Maastricht Treaty seem to 
have been strengthened in the European Parliament. European 
integration is not threatened, since the assembly itself is 
dominated by two groups of committed Europeanists: the 
Socialists, with 200 seats, and the European People's Party, 
with 148 deputies. But the right-wing groupings together could 
control 250 seats, and the intensification of political union 
could risk paralysis, in favor of a scaled-down free trade 
arrangement. So there is no certainty about Europe's future, 
and the only clearly European result comes from Austria, a 
country outside the Community. 
  Will the process of European integration slow down? Will the 
Franco-German axis survive? Will Britain's isolationism 
diminish? Will the federalist vision grow stronger, or will the 
free-trade vision prevail? 
  Perhaps the votes do not provide an answer to these 
questions, and were merely national polls on the strength or 
weakness of individual governments. [German Chancellor] Kohl 
and [Prime Minister] Berlusconi were rewarded. But Italy's 
Europeanism in the near future remains an unknown quantity, as 
does its position among the parliamentary groups. Kohl's 
Christian Democrats of course provide a guarantee; they want a 
federal Europe and are aiming for 1996 [intergovernmental 
conference]. But France's political landscape has fragmented, 
it will not be easy for any government in Paris to sustain an 
intensification of the supranational institutions in Brussels, 
and the Franco-German axis has certainly been weakened. It 
remains to wonder whether it will be strengthened by Major's 
spectacular defeat. But this raises the new problems posed by 
the victorious British Labor Party. In order to gain power it 
will have to take votes away from the pro-free trade 
Conservatives. It will have to dilute its reluctant 
Europeanism, which it embraced only a decade ago. How far will 
the British Labor Party back the Franco-German axis? 
  Furthermore, Kohl's success could set in motion a series of 
reactions connected with the danger that Europe will become too 
"German." The record level of abstention in the Netherlands 
reveals the emergence of some backtracking in the tough 
pro-German kernel, the losses by Belgium's Christian Democrats 
entail a new uncertainty, and the victory by the Danish 
Europeanists is threatened by the anti-Maastricht groups 
strengthened by the Socialists. Before judging Kohl's victory 
as an optimistic event for Europe, we must therefore assess all 
the interactions that a solely German leadership could entail in 
the center and the North. Even the enlargement to the East could 
become more complicated. 
  Obviously people are wondering whether the 12 "local" 
elections together reveal a more right-wing Europe than before. 
A simplified reckoning shows that there were three major 
winners and five major losers. Clear victories were scored by 
Berlusconi's center-right, Kohl's Christian Democrats, and 
Margaret Beckett's Labor Party. A defeat was suffered by 
Rocard's Socialists in France, Scharping's Social Democrats in 
Germany, Gonzalez's Socialists in Spain, the Italian left-wing 
forces led by Occhetto, and Major's Conservatives in Britain. 
The whole panorama shows that, except in Britain, Greece, and 
Portugal, the left-wing forces are losing ground everywhere in 
favor of the center or the right-wing forces. Everywhere a 
crisis of the social democratic forces is taking shape, with the 
resurrection of the Labor Party as the only exception. 
  The emergence of this crisis entails three consequences. The 
first is that the European Parliament, having long been the 
private domain of the Socialists and in which the Christian 
Democrats and Liberals were in a minority, has undergone a 
shifting of the balance in favor of the center-right. The 
second is that, without the help of the Labor Party, the 
European social democratic forces would have been canceled out 
and the Labor group will be the leading force in the new 
Eurosocialist alignment. The third is that the defeat of the 
Italian left-wing forces must also be set within this context. 
Although it reflects a "local" and national election, it also 
reflects a crisis common to all the European left-wing forces. 
  But this being so, three major questions arise. Is the 
eclipse of social democracy in Europe temporary or final? What 
contribution will the rebirth of the British Labor Party bring 
to European integration? Will the Italian left-wing forces 
succeed in analyzing their defeat against this background, 
rather than losing themselves in questions of alignment, in 
internal struggles between unidentifiable leaders? Indeed, the 
12 "local" elections reveal only one factor common to Europe: 
the widespread decline of the social democratic forces. They 
will have a decreasing influence in European integration, and 
this entails more than a few fewer seats in Strasbourg. It 
entails basic questions about the very nature of the Left and 
its future. We must consider why the Left was defeated 
everywhere, why it is not winning any more, and why it is losing 
ground at a time when European political union is being 
attempted. 
  Answers to these questions were sought years ago by David 
Caute, the historian of the book The Left-Wing Forces in 
Europe From 1789 Until Our Own Time. Indeed, it may be 
that the crisis of the Left stems from its difficulty in 
defining itself two centuries after its birth. It may be that, 
by dint of being pragmatic, it has been left without a doctrine 
and without programs and become a nebulous ideology. It may be 
that, having been born with the industrial revolution, it finds 
it difficult to represent a postindustrial society that is 
seeking new ways to organize itself. The end of communism 
called into question not only Leninism but also the socialism 
that preceded it. It may be, therefore, that the Left is losing 
because it is unable to consider what historical factors 
contributed to its development or decline, from which social 
classes it has commonly drawn support, and whether by chance it 
no longer knows what to be in a world that resembles less and 
less that which created it.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Giorgio Bocca: "Berlusconi Thanks His </F>
Enemies...."] 
  [Text] In all competitions the winner wins partly thanks to 
his own merits and partly also thanks to his adversary's 
weaknesses. And these weaknesses are partly the result of 
ignorance and presumption and partly the result of a history 
that has taken place and that it has been impossible to 
eliminate overnight. This is what has happened in the two 
recent elections, one confirming the other. What were the 
weaknesses and mistakes of the Left, for which Achille Occhetto 
is now paying? The first, I would say, was the inability of 
first the PCI [Italian Communist Party], then the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] to co-opt the moderates. It is 
not true that the Italian Left is numerically weaker than the 
Left in other European countries: It commands 30 percent, like 
the socialist parties in France, Britain, Spain, and Germany -- 
except that they find allies, whereas it does not. 
  The fault for this inability to co-opt does not of course 
lie 
solely with Occhetto and the rest of the leadership, which 
succeeded in making the abjuration that the Communist Parties of 
France, Spain, and Portugal never made. But this time it failed 
to overcome the imprinting of Third International-style 
communism, of the single and different party which could lead to 
the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
  This was seen extremely clearly at the 25 April and 1 May 
rallies. The party leadership wanted two great demonstrations 
of unified progressives; it wanted to bind the values of the 
resistance and labor to the democratic front that opposed the 
new Right, but the comrades in Reggio Emilia or Grosseto did not 
see it exactly that way: They came to Milan and Turin with 
their banners and flags to show Italy that the old Communist 
Party was still the strongest and different. And the moment 
Bossi and the League supporters joined the rallies they booed 
them loudly. 
  Their second mistake, or sad destiny, was to have taken 
insufficient account of the country's modernization -- and I am 
not talking about an ideal kind of modernization, but simply 
keeping pace with the times. There was a failure to realize 
that the crisis of the system of party domination was indeed the 
crisis of corrupt parties, but also of the party as such and of 
all large organizations of delegated responsibility; that 
monothematic class definitions had come to an end and that 
archipelagoes of different interests had emerged in their place. 
In other words, that although the workers existed, they were no 
longer visible as a class; that the trade unions existed, but no 
longer represented all the workers. 
  I think that this was easy to understand and that the PDS 
leaders did so; the difficult thing was to draw the necessary 
conclusions, to abandon the customary routine, the fiction that 
the old automatic relations between party, trade unions, and 
class still operated. 
  The third mistake was the hysteria common to the entire 
progressive front. The rejection of the election result, the 
belief that insults, scandal-mongering, and total negation were 
enough, if not to reverse the situation, then at least to freeze 
it. That was a mistake, and the European elections have 
confirmed the fact. 
  But Forza Italia won partly also thanks to the errors and 
weaknesses of the League and of its leader, Umberto Bossi. We 
knew he was not very British in his approach, but his inability 
to accept defeat displays very bad manners. He has been 
described as "that crazy uncle from Brianza" with reference to 
the rather eccentric, cantankerous, but nevertheless rather 
likable kind of uncle that you find living in the provinces. 
But what Bossi has been displaying for some time is not so much 
fierce polemics or eccentricity, as mental confusion. Somebody 
should explain to him -- though I fear it would be in vain -- 
that his contortions and inconsistencies achieve the result of 
earning Forza Italia more votes, as we have seen in the European 
elections. 
  Bossi thinks he is smart -- super-smart, in fact, someone 
who 
can deceive everyone by saying something and then retracting it. 
And he thought that the general elections, with the horse 
trading over the first-past-the-post system, were the ultimate 
proof of his cunning. He reasoned exactly like [former Italian 
Socialist Party Secretary] Bettino Craxi who, with his 11 
percent of the votes, wanted 30 percent of the seats. The 
Italian people would not agree to it, and if he thinks he can 
reverse the situation by shouting that Berlusconi is a 
mercenary, that he will deprive him of all his television 
channels, that the League is the only anti-dictatorial 
democratic force, which, however, instead of abandoning the 
dictatorship that is being formed, remains within it in order to 
resist it -- he is making a big mistake. 
  It is all nonsense, and nothing more so than the observation 
that "the Italian people failed to understand." But the Italian 
people, by penalizing him and the League's inconsistencies, 
simply followed their desire for stability, and if the new 
government's critical mass is Forza Italia, if the force which 
attracts votes by virtue of its sheer weight is Forza Italia, 
this is the very reason why they voted for it. The fact that 
this center-right option displeased the progressive forces and 
that some of them considered it repugnant, no less, is another 
matter, but you cannot expect those who granted the center-right 
a mandate for change in the general elections to perform a 
turnabout themselves within the space of a few weeks. 
  We hope that our fellow citizens will accept Achille 
Occhetto's resignation -- painful, we imagine -- in a civilized 
manner and that they do not attribute the Left's defeat to his 
moustache or other personal attributes. He showed great courage 
in carrying out the change of course, and now it is no tragedy 
to hand over the reins. With all the shady characters and 
scoundrels that have appeared on the political scene, it really 
would not be appropriate to crucify him....

  [Text] Helsinki, June 20 (AFP) -- The tiny Christian Party 
in Finland's center-right coalition government, headed by Prime 
Minister Esko Aho, decided on Monday [20 Jun] to leave the 
cabinet after differences of opinion over European Union [EU] 
membership. 
  Toini Kankaanniemi, minister for development aid and the 
party's only representative in cabinet, submitted his 
resignation to the premier after Aho denied him the right to 
vote against the government during a ballot to decide who would 
sign the country's EU membership agreement this weekend in Corfu. 
  The parliamentary group of the Christian Party decided later 
to leave the government and refrain from naming a new minister. 
  All seven members of the party in the 200-member parliament 
oppose Finland's plans to join the EU. 
  Last week the government defeated a no-confidence motion on 
its plans to join the EU next year, with members of the 
Christian Party abstaining. 
  The government, which was set up in April 1991 after general 
elections, also includes Aho's Centre Party (former Agrarian 
Party), the Conservatives and the Swedish Party, representing 
the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. 
  With the withdrawal of the Christian Party, the government 
has backing from 108 MPs.

<F P=106> [Article by Leena Hayrinen: "Whose Decision Was It To Join </F>
the EU Anyway? Will Those Decisionmakers Now Come Forward"] 
  [Text] The Center Party's Paavo Vayrynen has once again on 
his own initiative forcefully entered the Finnish internal 
policy debate. Vayrynen's diverging opinions concerning results 
Finland achieved in negotiations with the European Union [EU] 
has caused confusion not only within the Center Party troops but 
also among other political groupings. 
  The most sensational politician of the spring of 1994 
steadfastly holds his ground: He demands that those people who 
accepted the negotiation agreement have to answer to the Finnish 
people why Finland gave up its most important goals towards the 
end of the negotiations. In Vayrynen's opinion the culprits 
placed the timetable ahead of the end results, causing 
immeasurable damage. 
  He denies the assertions that he is looking for political 
gain for himself. The recent polemics in the papers, in his 
opinion, once again is a sign that the atmosphere is getting 
more intolerant towards diverging opinions. 
  "Who decided that Finland had to go along with the agreement 
on the EU membership, even though the goals had not been 
reached?" That is what parliamentarian Vayrynen is asking. 
  "Feeling? Good!" Vayrynen exclaims. He is smiling happily, 
he is telling the truth: He is in his own element, and that 
includes suffering. The familiar, calm voice is telling the 
story we have heard before: Vayrynen has come to a turning point 
once again. 
  He is being treated harshly, the vultures are circling 
above, 
attacking him mercilessly. Reporters who do not understand 
Vayrynen are at it again, and they do not refrain from using 
underhanded means. 
  "When I think about how I have been treated after the 
presidential elections, I get the feeling there is no room for 
me in this country. No matter what I do, it is always wrong." 
  Vayrynen does not see himself as the poor little boy who 
landed at the bottom of the ditch, and who everyone doubts will 
ever get up and out of there, although it is generally known, 
too, that he has come out of terrible situations over and over 
again. 
  "In the presidential elections I did very well, and 
everything that I have done since then has been just right." 
<H5>  No Stand on EU </H5>
  Vayrynen points out that he has not taken a stand on the EU 
membership as yet. He will have to do it together with the 
others in the event that his proposal to postpone it will not be 
accepted. 
  "Later on our negotiation position would be much stronger, 
because our economy is getting better. We would not need to get 
support for the transition period, and consequently we would get 
more permanent support from the EU, thus improving our 
competitive position. We could also accept somewhat smaller 
regional policy support since that does not provide as great a 
national gain as the fact that the competitive situation will be 
leveled out on the food industry markets." 
  He believes firmly that the EU would want to have Finland as 
a member even later on, even if we would put on the brakes 
rights now. We are a very good member, if we join. "Even if 
the EU would agree to conditions that are more beneficial to us, 
we still would bring our additional contributions to the EU." 
  Vayrynen wants to deny the claim that there are only two 
alternatives: yes or no. He believes that even if the no votes 
would win, the membership could be taken up again for 
negotiations sooner or later. 
<H5>  Who Did It? </H5>
  Vayrynen was himself foreign minister at the time when the 
decision was made to apply for the EU membership, and he is 
still of the opinion that it was the right decision. 
  "The mistake was made in February-March, when Finland 
decided 
to conclude the agreement with poor conditions. They did not 
hang on to the negotiation goals that had been set. If they had 
continued to negotiate, certainly a few additional concessions 
could have been gained. Now they were in a hurry to make this 
decision because of the EU parliamentary elections," Vayrynen 
criticizes. 
  "It would be interesting to know how they made this 
decision. 
Who did it and what were the grounds on the basis of which this 
course of action was regarded as wise? That is something we do 
not know," Vayrynen says. He points out there are rumors going 
around about this issue, however, he is not going to repeat 
them. 
  "I would consider it only right, however, that those who 
made 
the decision should also give their justification for the 
matter, after all, now the Finns will be tied to the decision." 
  [SUOMEN KUVALEHTI] If you were president, would you talk 
about the matter now the same way? 
  [Vayrynen] No. If I had been president, Finland would not 
have concluded the agreement under these conditions. 
  [SUOMEN KUVALEHTI] So are you now referring to the incumbent 
president? It is my understanding that several persons went 
along with this, apparently both the previous and the current 
president, the prime minister, and the chief negotiators, at 
least this circle. I do not know if larger groups were 
involved. Democratic principles would require that they tell 
how this conclusive decision was made. 
  [Vayrynen] It has been my experience that when important 
decisions are made it is prudent to assess ahead of time under 
what conditions the agreement will be accepted and the 
negotiations will then be continued until satisfactory 
conditions will be reached, otherwise the agreement will not be 
concluded. During the last weeks of the EU negotiations there 
was a decisive change. All of a sudden we were ready to join 
when the timetable became more important than the content. 
<H5>  Emotional Problems </H5>
  In Vayrynen's opinion, the agreement that was reached is 
poor 
with regard to content and its schedule impossible. 
  The most fundamental weakness of the content, according to 
Vayrynen, is the fact that the agricultural support system for 
northern Finland that had been set as a goal was not reached. 
When the EU territory will make a transition to the free trade 
of agricultural products, the competitive premises of Finnish 
farms will be poor. And furthermore, the EU has a common 
agricultural policy that favors areas with better conditions 
than Finland's. 
  "And the thought that the Finnish taxpayers would then 
salvage what we lost with this agreement is ludicrous in my 
opinion. It just is not possible to pay so much support that we 
could guarantee the future of our own food industry." 
  The alternative is not cheap, either, for the taxpayer. 
  "It depends on how you calculate it. Right now we have the 
opportunity to take advantage of the border protection in order 
to protect our own food production, therefore we need less 
support from the taxpayers to maintain our own agriculture. But 
if we join the EU, then we can only use the taxpayers' money. 
The decisions are made somewhere else, and the Finnish taxpayer 
is allowed to support the mighty masters of Germany, France, and 
Denmark. 
  ``If we open our eyes and take a good look, this decision 
forebodes very gloomy prospects for the future with regard to 
the rural areas, agriculture, food industry, and thus the whole 
national economy,'' Vayrynen claims. 
  The Finnish discussion of the EU membership has been rather 
irrational, in Vayrynen's opinion. He is asking how the 
reporter intends to translate a strange word for the readers. 
Then he clarifies it himself, "So it is a question of image and 
emotions!" 
  He admits that as a member Finland would be permitted to 
participate in making decisions on matters that it already has 
agreed to within the framework of the European Economic Area 
(EEA), pointing out that actually this is the only significant 
issue on a general level that favors the membership. 
  With regard to the food processing industry, the 
justification is inadequate in his opinion: The membership would 
be tantamount to changing from our own independent agricultural 
policy to the supranational decisionmaking within the EU. "We 
have no reason to anticipate that the strongest producing 
countries would treat us any better as members than when we 
negotiated about the conditions." 
<H5>  As a Member of Parliament </H5>
  In Vayrynen's opinion many people even want to be deceived 
in 
this EU matter. "They do not want to hear the unpleasant truth, 
but try to convince themselves, instead, that they will manage 
somehow. It is difficult to stick to your own opinion under the 
pressures from the public opinion," he notes. 
  "And then there are people like this reckless Vayrynen who 
is 
not afraid to tell how the things really are, and of course he 
is pelted with stones. I intend to continue, nevertheless." 
  Vayrynen rejects the suggestion that on the basis of his 
taking this position he is trying to drive his party into 
opposition while all the others are very prominently expressing 
their support for the EU. As a matter of fact he sees the 
matter in a totally different light: In order to gain needed 
majority for the membership in the parliament, the government 
also will have to have forces that enjoy the confidence of the 
doubters. 
  When asked, Vayrynen assures that after 24 years of 
experience he holds high respect for the duties of the Finnish 
members of parliament, and he believes that it is possible to 
make a difference even without official positions. The only 
problem such a supercharged person like Vayrynen has is that 
there is not enough to do; even before he had to kill time by 
writing books. 
  Next moment, however, he begins to ponder about the 
"conditions involving a regular member of the parliament" as 
follows: "When you do not have any specific important position 
of trust, you need to address the issues in a stronger fashion 
if you want your voice to be heard. On the other hand, you are 
free to express stronger opinions when you do not need to take 
into consideration the limitations of the position. 
  ``I felt it was my duty to make sacrifices so as to be able 
to initiate proper debate. If I had thought about my own 
interests, I would have just gone along with the others. But I 
am not an image politician. I follow my own way. At times it 
is awfully difficult, when everyone is beating me up, sometimes 
I am standing in pouring rain, sometimes I am pelted with rocks. 
But my conscience is clear. I am confident that the issues will 
be understood in a wider context when the dust has settled.''

<F P=106> [Report by Christer Kallstrom: "War Over Cod Grows </F>
Increasingly Serious"] 
  [Text] Oslo -- Norway and Iceland are again at loggerheads 
over the cod in the seas around Spitsbergen. Yesterday 
Norwegian Coast Guard vessels cut the trawls of four Icelandic 
boats and fired a warning shot across the bows of a fifth. 
  In Iceland feelings about the Norwegians are acrimonious, 
and 
Icelandic Prime Minister David Oddsson is considering taking the 
matter to the International Court in The Hague. 
  Yesterday Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal 
summoned Eidur Gudnason, Iceland's ambassador in Oslo, to ask 
for an explanation of the behavior of the Icelandic fishermen. 
At the meeting Bjorn Tore Godal urged the Icelandic authorities 
to see to it that the country's fishing fleet respects the 
Norwegian protection zone around Spitsbergen. After the meeting 
Bjorn Tore Godal said that the gap between Iceland and Norway is 
smaller than expected, despite everything. 
  After the meeting Ambassador Eidur Gudnason said the 
following: 
  "In Iceland people are surprised by the aggressiveness that 
the Norwegians showed toward the fishermen. The most natural 
thing would have been to board the boats and take them into 
port." 
  Cutting the trawls of a fishing boat is considered to be a 
very serious action, as is firing warning shots. 
  The Norwegian side, however, believes that the Icelanders 
were intending to provoke a serious situation. On previous 
occasions fishing boats have drawn in their trawls when the 
Norwegian Coast Guard has approached. They did not do so this 
time. 
  Icelandic Prime Minister David Oddsson's comments also 
support this theory: 
  "Norway has no right to cut the trawls of Icelandic boats. 
We are now considering whether we should put the matter before 
the International Court in The Hague. We must have a judgment 
that will decide once and for all what status in international 
law the protection zone around Spitsbergen has." 
  The protection zone around Spitsbergen is a disputed area. 
It is a 200-nautical-mile zone and was set up by Norway in 
1977. So far only Finland has recognized the zone. 
  The old Soviet Union took the view that Norway has no rights 
outside the 3-nautical-mile limit of its territorial waters. 
The great powers in the West have adopted a reserved attitude 
to the fisheries protection zone. 
  Recently the Norwegian Coast Guard has noted a marked 
increase in illicit fishing around Spitsbergen. Yesterday there 
were nine boats in the protected zone from countries that have 
not been granted quotas there. As well as six Icelandic boats 
there were two boats registered in the Dominican Republic and 
one registered in Belize. 
  Yesterday the six Icelandic boats left the protected zone 
escorted by two Norwegian Coast Guard vessels. 
  This incident comes at a particularly bad time for Iceland. 
On Friday [17 Jun] Iceland will celebrate the 50th anniversary 
of its becoming a republic and among those invited is Norwegian 
King Harald.

<F P=106> [Report by Jan Gunnar Furuly: "`We Had To Act'"] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal says that Norway 
had to take steps in the Barents Sea to avoid "invasion" by 
foreign trawlers. 
  "The increase in illicit fishing by foreign vessels in the 
Spitsbergen zone was most unfortunate from the resource 
management viewpoint and appeared to be an attempt to test the 
extent to which there should be free fishing in the area. The 
consequences of not intervening could have been that other 
countries would see their chance to move into the fishing zone," 
Godal said. 
  Eidur Gudnason, Iceland's ambassador in Oslo, was yesterday 
summoned to the Foreign Ministry to give an explanation of the 
activities of Icelandic trawlers in the protection zone that 
Norway declared unilaterally. 
  "We have been taken by surprise by Norway's tough reaction. 
Many Icelanders are interpreting it to mean that the Norwegian 
authorities have acted so brutally because their position in law 
is so weak. The normal thing would have been to bring the boats 
into Norwegian ports, in order to have the situation clarified 
in court," Gudnason told AFTENPOSTEN after the 50-minute meeting 
with Godal. 
  Gudnason, who until last fall was Iceland's minister for the 
environment and for Nordic cooperation, added that the 
skirmishes between the Coast Guard and the trawlers represent 
the most serious crisis between Iceland and Norway in modern 
times. As far as AFTENPOSTEN is able to judge, it is likely 
that things have not been this bad between the brother countries 
since the Norwegians took Christianity to the island nation to 
the west. 
  After the meeting Foreign Minister Godal stressed that the 
distance between Norway and Iceland in the disagreement over 
fishing rights is smaller than might be feared. 
  "The ambassador gave assurances that the Icelandic 
Government 
has in no way urged the boats to sail to the protection zone, 
but that on the contrary it has strongly requested that fishing 
should cease out of respect for Iceland's long-term fishing 
interests," Godal said. He rejected the suggestion that Norway 
is now fearful that Iceland will bring the matter before the 
International Court in The Hague. 
  "Our position in international law is very strong. We have 
nothing to lose in a possible court case in The Hague. Even if 
only Finland has formally recognized the protection zone, the 
European Union [EU] and other fisheries nations in the North 
Atlantic, apart from Iceland, have recognized Norwegian 
competence and authority in the area," Godal said. 
  Yesterday evening Icelandic Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin 
Hannibalsson criticized the reaction of the Norwegian Coast 
Guard at a news conference in Reykjavik, but he also stressed 
that Iceland in no way wants to escalate the conflict. 
  Hannibalsson is now proposing that Norway and Iceland should 
agree to settle the conflict over the protection zone through 
arbitration, or by bringing the matter before an international 
court. 
  "It is the view of the Icelandic authorities that the 
Norwegian action is completely out of step with inspection 
procedures for international fisheries. In Iceland's view 
cutting trawls in international waters has no support in law," 
Hannibalsson said. Earlier the foreign minister had had meetings 
on the cod war with Norway with Prime Minister David Oddsson, 
the Althing Foreign Affairs Committee, and representatives of 
fishing boat owners.

<F P=106> [Article by Kjell Dragnes: "Fighting Over the Last Hunting </F>
Grounds"] 
  [Text] Fishing is the last major human economic activity 
that can be said to be part of the culture of the hunter -- 
catching animals from stocks that have not been tamed. And in a 
way this is what is the ideological foundation for the 
Icelanders' fishing in the loophole [disputed area in Barents 
Sea] and in the fisheries protection zone around Spitsbergen. 
  When hunters had made sufficient use of stocks in an area 
they moved to other areas. This is precisely what Icelandic 
trawlers do today; they have overfished off Iceland and are now 
looking for other hunting grounds. But today there are almost 
no free hunting grounds. A system of international laws and 
rules aims at protecting and maintaining natural resources. 
This is a system of laws and rules that Iceland has at times 
pushed for. 
  The cod wars in the seventies happened because Iceland 
extended its jurisdiction over the seas, first to 50 nautical 
miles, and then to 200 nautical miles. Later these principles 
became enshrined in the Law of the Sea Treaty, which was signed 
on 10 December 1982. Iceland is in fact the only developed 
country that has ratified the treaty, and the Icelanders have 
also been very active in the work of the United Nations to solve 
the problem of the exploitation of wandering fish stocks. 
Iceland's view: Littoral states should have greater control 
over these stocks, even when they are to be found outside their 
economic zones. 
  Norwegian-Arctic cod is one of these wandering fish stocks. 
Spawning takes place close to the coast (Lofoten), and the fish 
grow up off Spitsbergen, on fishing banks inside economic zones, 
and outside them -- in the so-called loophole. The Icelanders 
are not only felling trees in someone else's forest by fishing 
here; they are also felling all small trees and destroying 
growth. 
  Norway introduced its 200-mile zone on 1 January 1977. Here 
Norwegian jurisdiction applies, with the exception of the gray 
zone. The gray zone was something new, created in negotiations 
in the summer of 1977, in order to solve the problem of fish 
stock management. The demarcation line between the Norwegian 
and Russian 200-mile zones has not yet been drawn. The gray 
zone is an interim arrangement. 
  The fisheries protection zone around Spitsbergen is a 
halfway 
house and a legal nut that has still not been cracked. It was 
introduced on 15 June 1977, but only Finland has recognized 
Norway's right to enforce the zone. Norway's view is clear: 
Spitsbergen has no continental shelf of its own; it is an 
extension of the Norwegian continental shelf. We have therefore 
a full right both to have an economic zone and to regulate the 
fish in the sea and the resources under the seabed. The 
fisheries protection zone is simply an interim solution to 
regulate fish stocks in an important nursery area. 
  The problem lies in the Spitsbergen Treaty -- signed on 9 
February 1920 and now acceded to by 40 countries. The treaty 
gives Norway sovereignty, but it also states that "the ships and 
subjects of all the contracting parties will have similar rights 
to fishing and hunting in the areas mentioned in article 1 and 
in their territorial waters." 
  Norway takes the view that "territorial waters" means a 
4-mile limit, in line with the way that the territorial waters 
of other countries are calculated. Other countries take the 
view that the treaty must apply in sea areas and on the 
continental shelf contained within certain limits: between the 
74th and 84th parallels and between 10 and 35 degrees east. If 
you draw these lines on the map you get the so-called 
Spitsbergen box. 
  The problem remains unsolved. But up to now all the 
countries which traditionally have fishing rights off 
Spitsbergen -- something Iceland does not have -- have remained 
silent and accepted that the fisheries protection zone is 
enforced -- as they put it in law: de facto, but not de jure. 
  European Union [EU] fishermen report their catches to 
Norway, 
the Russians refuse to sign catch protocols, but accept 
inspection and regulation. This has not happened without blows. 
Spain in particular was extremely aggressive in 1986. 
  But regardless of whether the Spitsbergen Treaty or the Law 
of the Sea Treaty is taken as the point of departure, it is 
Norway that administers the treaty. So when the Icelanders 
claim that the Coast Guard is behaving illegally, they are on 
very shaky ground. For the fishing waters off Spitsbergen are 
not open seas.

<F P=106> [Report by Dick Ljungberg: "Continued Strong Support for </F>
Social Democrats"] 
  [Text] The main rivals in the election -- the Moderates 
and the Social Democratic Party [SDP] -- have made gains in 
DAGENS NYHETER/Temo's poll on party standings for June. 
Together with the Left Party, Ingvar Carlsson has a lead of all 
of 17.5 percent over the bruised nonsocialist government three 
months before the election. 
  Despite the fact that the Moderates have gained 3 percentage 
points, the nonsocialist bloc hardly makes any net gains among 
the electorate. At the same time the Left Party has 
strengthened its position above the 4-percent threshold for 
representation in the Riksdag. 
  The Christian Democratic Party, however, is lying exactly on 
the threshold and the Green Ecology Party falls 1 percent under 
it. The Center Party -- which today holds its national congress 
in Falun -- and the Liberal Party are having a difficult time in 
the shadow of the Moderates. New Democracy attracts only 1 
percent of voters and can now be considered to be out for the 
count. 
  The poll was carried out between 8 and 15 June, and was 
therefore completed the evening before Olof Johansson left the 
government. The crisis began on 11 June when Prime Minister 
Carl Bildt announced in the Riksdag that everything was ready 
for a yes to the bridge and this made the Center Party 
leader/environment minister feel that he had been steamrollered. 
  Telephone interviews were carried out with 1,012 persons who 
were asked how they would vote if there were an election today. 
  Results in percent with changes since the May poll in 
parentheses: 

  -  Moderate Coalition Party 23.0 (plus 3.0) 
  -  Liberal Party 6.0 
(minus 1.5) 
  -  Center Party 6.0 (unchanged) 
  -  Christian Democratic 
Party 4.0 (minus 1.0) 
  -  Social Democratic Party 51.5 (plus 
1.5) 
  -  Left Party 5.0 (plus 0.5) 
  -  New Democracy 1.0 (minus 
0.5) 
  -  Green Ecology Party 3.0 (minus 1.0) 
  -  Other parties 0.5 
(minus 1.0). 

  The proportion of don't knows is 11.5 percent, an increase 
of 
1.5 percent since May. The proportion of respondents who 
indicated their party sympathy and are "sure" of their choice is 
64.5 percent, a small increase since the last poll. 
  In May the Social Democrats and the Left Party together had 
54.5 percent against the government parties' 38.5. In June this 
lead has increased to 56.5 (plus 2.0) against 39.0 (plus 0.5). 
  In the government the Moderates -- with the their highest 
Temo showing since the beginning of 1992 -- are now 7 percentage 
points bigger than the other three government parties -- 
something that is unlikely to stimulate their interest in 
government. Bengt Westerberg is also reported to have been very 
afraid in Thursday's [16 June] lengthy crisis negotiations with 
the Center Party of being left alone in the government with two 
"right-wing parties." 
  The Left Party's 5 percent is the party's best Temo score in 
the election period. Gudrun Schyman cannot feel safe, but with 
the Social Democrats' top score of 51.5 percent there ought to 
be some scope for support votes for the Left Party from Comrade 
4 Percent. The Green Ecology Party moved up to the magic 4 
percent immediately after the publicity surrounding its 
congress. However, the Greens have long been steady around 3 
percent and cannot be counted out. 
  New Democracy, however, can be. Since the previous poll they 
have held a new chaotic congress in Vasteras that led to a new 
step toward annihilation at national level.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] Recent developments in the Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement (PASOK) in light of its recent congress and 
the elections of executive bureau members have been discussed in 
the Greek press. 
<H5>  Executive Bureau Elections Favor Tsokhatzopoulos </H5>
  According to Stavros Liyeros, writing in the 22 May Athens 
daily I KATHIMERINI, the election of the PASOK executive bureau 
members indicates that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's power 
over the party is "fully established." The election also 
confirmed the role of Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, PASOK secretary 
general, as "interpreter of Papandreou's will." According to 
Liyeros, a new balance of power is shaping within the party, 
with a "dividing line" between those allied with Papandreou and 
others who function as the "opposition." The former, led by 
Tsokhatzopoulos, include those PASOK factions nicknamed the 
"Italian group," the "Yennimatas group," the "Arsenis group," as 
well as top officials such as Chamber of Deputies President 
Apostolos Kaklamanis, Minister of Environment Kostas Laliotis, 
and PASOK official Stefanos Tzoumakas. On the opposition side 
stand the "Simitis group," the faction under the influence of 
PASOK luminary Vaso Papandreou, and Alternate Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Thodhoros Pangalos, who is following an 
"autonomous" course. These developments are important because 
of the ongoing struggle to succeed Papandreou, who, it is now 
apparent, will run for the presidency in 1995, Liyeros wrote. 
According to Liyeros, Tsokhatzopoulos is thought to hold most 
of the trump cards in a succession race because of his power 
over the party apparatus. However, many party officials, 
including some Papandreou allies, do not consider him fit for 
the prime ministership, even if they accept him as party leader, 
Liyeros noted. Tsokhatzopoulos aides are spreading the rumor 
that, if Papandreou decides to run for the presidency, he will 
support his "trusted lieutenant" to succeed him, since this 
would allow the prime minister to maintain his influence over 
the party. However, other party sources cited by Liyeros 
believe that papandreou will favor a transitional, 
consensus-based leadership. According to Liyeros, many younger 
party officials, joined by would-be "heirs-apparent" aware they 
have no chance of being chosen, are positioning themselves for 
such a solution. 
  Tsokhatzopoulos' biggest problem, Liyeros continued, will be 
dealing with Pangalos, who will intensify his "guerrilla" 
warfare within the party, having already stated he "will not 
spare his criticism" if the new executive bureau, of which he is 
not a member, proves "inefficient." Tsokhatzopoulos will have to 
confront pangalos without the support of the Papandreou-allied 
groups, Liyeros noted, since these are worried about the 
secretary general's increasing power and would not oppose a 
Pangalos attempt to "whittle it down." 
<H5>  Laliotis Support of Tsokhatzopoulos Discussed </H5>
  In a reference to the so-called troika of PASOK's early 
days--composed of the late Yiorgos Yennimatas, Akis 
Tsokhatzopoulos, and Kostas Laliotis--I.K. Pretenderis, writing 
in the 22 May Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS, cited a number 
of political observers as convinced that Tsokhatzopoulos would 
not have realized his goals at the party's third congress 
without enlisting Laliotis' support. A number of PASOK 
officials believe that, in return for his support in the 
Papandreou succession race, Tsokhatzopoulos promised Laliotis 
the post of secretary general. However, Pretenderis questioned 
Laliotis' motives for clashing with the "modernizing tendency" 
with which he has recently identified himself in the party and 
cited some observers as attributing it to his deteriorating 
relationship with "modernizer" Vaso Papandreou, whom he did not 
support in the race for the executive bureau. Another 
explanation, according to Pretenderis, is Laliotis' estimation 
that Papandreou will be succeeded by "short-time" leaders, of 
whom Tsokhatzopoulos is but the first. A third explanation 
rests on the argument for a "legitimate succession," which would 
designate Tsokhatzopoulos as the immediate successor followed by 
the third member of the "historical leadership," Laliotis 
himself.

<F P=106> [Report by K. Kiriakidhis] </F>
  [Text] Under the current conditions, further efforts to 
continue the talks on the confidence-building measures may 
result in the opposite -- their destruction. 
  According to I MAKHI information from the UN headquarters, 
UN 
Security Council members seem to be heading toward this 
conclusion and believe that for now, the best solution would be 
to adopt a compromise formula (in the upcoming UN Security 
Council resolution). This would avoid a "head on" clash with the 
UN Secretariat, would not expose UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali (based on his 30 May report), and at the same time 
prevent the possibility of President Glavkos Kliridhis 
resigning. It would also keep the implementation of the 
confidence-building measures on the negotiating table at a 
priority level. 
  The same sources added that Security Council members appear 
determined to safeguard the confidence-building measures even if 
this means temporarily sidelining them. This is why they seem 
to end up in a two-stage scenario about the future course of the 
Cyprus issue: In the first stage (according to Butrus-Ghali's 
fourth alternative) they will send representatives from the five 
UN Security Council permanent members to the 
Ankara-Athens-Nicosia triangle to reach an agreement on the 
basic principles that would characterize a future overall 
solution to the Cyprus issue. By doing this they will create 
the appropriate conditions to guarantee an effective "passage" 
to the second stage, the implementation of the 
confidence-building measures (not discussion) while at the same 
time beginning new negotiations on the substance of the Cyprus 
issue (for example demilitarization). 
  Circles in Nicosia have expressed their optimism that 
according to the developments that are being formed, the 
Security Council will not select Butrus-Ghali's fifth 
alternative and only recommend that talks on 
theconfidence-building measures continue. 
  In any case, yesterday a diplomat of a country that is a 
permanent UN Security Council member told I MAKHI that a lot 
depends on Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' final positions 
on the implementation of the measures. Denktas is expected to 
relate his positions to Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary 
general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, during 
their meeting today. 
  The diplomat also revealed that in his well-known letters, 
President Glavkos Kliridhis stresses his readiness to proceed in 
an agreement on the measures based on the 21 March UN document. 
He added: This is why all the Security Council members are 
taking Kliridhis' positions seriouly and respect his 
constructive stance during the duration of the talks on the 
measures. He reiterated, however, that the new positions of the 
Turkish Cypriot leader following the UN secretary general's 30 
May report, which he described as positive, cannot be overlooked. 
  Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis reiterated 
yesterday 
morning that President Kliridhis has made it clear that he will 
resign if our side is forced to participate in further 
negotiations on the confidence-building measures, unless the 
Turkish side accepts the 21 March UN document as is.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "We Are Running Out of Time"] </F>
  [Text] The UN organization, which has failed to resolve the 
Cyprus problem during the past 30 years, has moved to blame the 
Turkish Cypriot side for the lack of a solution on the island 
through UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's designs. 
Butrus-Ghali's biased, aggressive, and blackmailing report to 
the UN Security Council is fresh confirmation of that painful 
reality. 
  Meanwhile, the European Union [EU], which wants to have a 
say 
on the Cyprus problem, has moved to find a way to benefit from 
the UN officials' failure to resolve the Cyprus problem. EU 
officials believe that "since the United Nations has been unable 
to resolve the problem during the past 30 years, then the EU 
should move into action." Obviously, the EU approach on the 
Cyprus problem will be similar to the approach the UN 
organization has maintained thus far. Consequently, it will be 
unsuccessful, at least as much as that organization has been. 
  However, finding a realistic solution to the problem is not 
their objective. Therefore, what difference would it make if the 
UN organization or the EU wastes time on it? After all, their 
objective is similar: To completely Hellenize the island by 
forcing the Turkish Cypriots to agree to having minority rights. 
The way that objective is to be achieved has come into light. 
The security and the communal and sovereignty rights of the 
Turkish Cypriots will be ignored and Cyprus will be admitted to 
the EU as a member. In other words, the integration between 
Greece and Cyprus will be realized within the EU framework. 
  Considering all that, we can regard Butrus Butrus-Ghali's 
latest report as an indication of the UN organization's 
inclination to withdraw and leave the EU in the arena. 
  If we have realized the design behind admitting Cyprus into 
the EU in Turkey's absence, then we should not ignore the fact 
that we have to make a historic assessment. 
  That the process of admitting Cyprus into the EU as a member 
will begin on 1 January 1995 is a strong possibility. 
Apparently, plans are being drawn up with that date in mind. 
Therefore, we have to work with Turkey to decide on new 
alternatives. In fact, we are running out of time for that.

  [Text] Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov, who arrived 
in Turkey yesterday as the guest of President Suleyman Demirel, 
began his contacts today. The official talks between the two 
countries' delegations were also held in Ankara today. Demirel 
and Niyazov signed a memorandum of understanding incorporating 
the possibilities for cooperation between the two countries. 
  This morning Niyazov first visited the Ataturk Mausoleum, 
where he laid a wreath, observed a moment of silence, and signed 
the guest book. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin accompanied the 
visiting president. 
  Niyazov then met with Demirel at the Cankaya Mansion. Also 
attending the meeting were Cetin and Turkmen Foreign Minister 
Khalykberdi Atayev. Later, talks were held between the two 
countries' delegations headed by their respective presidents. 
  At the end of the talks, Demirel and Niyazov signed a 
memorandum of understanding, incorporating the possibilities for 
cooperation between the two countries and displaying their 
political will to develop cooperation. 
  In a speech after the signing, Demirel declared that 
Turkmenistan, which gained its independence following the 
bloodless dissolution of the Soviet Union, has always 
entertained good relations with Turkey. Stressing that the 
peoples of the two countries are brothers, Demirel said: 
Turkmenistan is our motherland, and Turkey is the second 
homeland of the Turkmen people. 
  Demirel explained that the most important project between 
the 
two countries is the natural gas pipeline and that during the 
talks the sides reached an agreement on the realization of the 
project as soon as possible. 
  Niyazov, in turn, said that agreement was reached during the 
talks in Ankara on several issues. Underlining that he shares 
all of Demirel's views with regard to bilateral relations, 
Niyazov expressed gratitude for the support accorded to his 
country until now. 
  The memorandum of understanding signed between the two 
countries envisages cooperation on infrastructure projects such 
as highways, railroads, and ports, as well as cooperation in the 
fields of industry, agriculture, and energy. The memorandum 
stresses their determination to realize the pipeline project for 
transporting Turkmen natural gas to Europe via Turkey. Under 
the memorandum, the two countries also grant most favored nation 
status to one another.

  [Text] Ankara, June 20 (A.A) -- Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller on Monday [20 June] met with Turkmenistan President 
Saparmurad Niyazov, currently in Turkey on an official visit. 
  She said during the meeting that Turkey and Turkmenistan 
share common cultural and historical ties and have good 
relations, adding that efforts should be made to take them even 
further. 
  She said that Eximbank opened a credit line of 90 million 
dollars to the republic to develop trade between the two 
countries, and 10 million have not yet been used, adding further 
requests could be met with pleasure.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has declared that he 
believes in the benefit of developing cooperation among the 
Central Asian republics, which share a common history, culture, 
and geography. Demirel hosted a dinner in honor of Turkmen 
President Saparmurad Niyazov at the Cankaya Mansion tonight. 
  In a dinner toast, Demirel remarked that the relations 
between the two countries progressed significantly, strengthened 
by cultural and linguistic ties. Pointing out that the 
beneficial talks held with President Niyazov today gave a brand 
new impetus to bilateral relations, Demirel said: I have no 
doubt that Turkish-Turkmen cooperation, the legal foundations of 
which have largely been concluded as a result of the 
approximately 40 agreements reached between the two countries, 
will be further enhanced on the basis of equality, mutual 
interest, love, and respect. 
  The two countries were forced to live apart and yearned for 
one another in the course of history, Demirel explained, adding 
that they are now experiencing the happiness of reunification 
after a separation of hundreds of years. 
  [Begin Demirel recording] We are following with appreciation 
the reforms launched under your capable leadership and the 
distance covered by your country despite all the difficult 
conditions. We appreciate the constructive approach you have 
adopted while you build and strengthen your national state and 
conduct good relations with your neighbors. This approach 
contributes to peace and stability in your region. We believe 
in the benefit of developing cooperation among the Central Asian 
republics, which share the same history, culture, and geography, 
and which face similar needs and problems. With its serious and 
balanced foreign policy based on open doors and positive 
impartiality, Turkmenistan has occupied the position it deserves 
in the international arena. [end recording] 
  Demirel concluded by saying that in this difficult 
transition 
period, Turkey considers it a brotherly duty to support and 
assist Turkmenistan in every field. 
  In his speech, Niyazov stated that Turkish firms have 
contributed to the development of his country's economy. He 
explained that approximately 20 Turkish firms are conducting 
business in Turkmenistan. Pointing out that the conflicts in 
Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, and Georgia affect his country as well, 
Niyazov remarked that important tasks fall on international 
organizations in resolving these conflicts. He stressed that 
Turkmenistan shares the same views as Turkey in international 
issues. Niyazov noted that the project to transport Turkmen 
natural gas to Turkey is very important for both countries. 
  Attending the dinner were Kamer Genc, acting speaker of the 
Turkish Grand National Assembly; Prime Minister Tansu Ciller;

  [Text] Ankara, June 20 (A.A) -- Sedat Yurtdas, expelled 
from Parliament last Thursday [16 June], said today that they 
will not leave the Parliament building, because of the order 
given by the chief prosecutor to detain them. 
  As the Constitutional Court last Thursday decided to ban the 
Democracy Party [DEP] and strip its 13 members from Parliament 
membership, Ankara State Security Court Chief Prosecutor Nusret 
Demiral ordered the detention of Sedat Yurtdas and Selim Sadak, 
the two remaining DEP members. 
  After learning that they will be detained, the two deputies 
received a call from Deputy Parliament Speaker Kamer Genc who 
told them that he will not allow the police to enter the 
premises and will take action before the High Board of Judges 
and Prosecutors to protect the deputies. 
  He added that Parliament Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk and 
Demiral disagreed on their detention.

<F P=106> [Column by Oktay Eksi: "How Can the Following Be </F>
Explained?"] 
  [Text] Understanding the motives of those who wish to 
undermine the secular system in Turkey is not difficult. 
However, those who are convinced that "nothing can happen" 
should also be considered.... Understanding their approach is 
impossible. Are they truly convinced that nothing can happen? 
That the profundamentalist forces, which are led by the 
Prosperity Party, cannot come to power in the future and that 
those forces will not remove the democratic system if they do? 
If that is the way they look at things, then are they unable to 
see the situation in the countries that have adopted the 
"Islamic way of life?" Unfortunately, the situation cannot be 
explained to them. No matter what you say, they will respond: 
"Do not worry, nothing can happen." That will make you feel 
frantic. At least, that is how I feel because I do not believe 
that a threat can be described as "small" or "unimportant." 
  If a problem poses a "threat," then a solution must be found 
to it. However, the view Speaker of the Grand National Assembly 
Husamettin Cindoruk has expressed on the matter is as follows: 
"The anxiety on the secular system's future is baseless. Our 
people will defend secularism. The people will support us to 
defend secularism if we effectively explain what it means to 
them. The secular system is guaranteed not only by the 
Constitution but also by the people." That is a baseless view 
that conflicts with reality. It has made me feel that I am 
among officials who are deaf and dumb. 
  Yes, that view conflicts with reality. Was Husamettin 
Cindoruk not in Turkey when the elections were held on 27 March? 
If not, was he not informed of the outcome of those elections? 
Is he among those who defend the view that "Turkey and Algeria 
are two different countries?" 
  It is true that Algeria is not similar to Turkey.... A 
comparison between the two countries will show many things in 
favor of Turkey, which will raise the people's morale. However, 
I wish to recall the following: All the other Islamic countries 
said "we are different from Iran" when Ayatollah Khomeyni ousted 
the Iranian shah's regime and established a fundamentalist 
order. Several correspondents arrived in Turkey and asked who 
our "khomeyni" was at the time. We laughed at them because we 
were convinced that the "khomeyni" in Turkey commanded only 7 or 
9 percent of the votes and that the Turkish people had adopted 
the secular system as a way of life. However, we were unaware 
that the United States was trying to establish a green belt of 
fundamentalist countries against the former Soviet Union to 
check Communism at the time. Consequently, it supported the 
religious trends and organizations, regardless of its dispute 
with the Khomeyni regime in Iran. 
  Let us consider the changes that have taken place since that 
time: An Islamic order has been established in Sudan, which 
said in the past that "Iran is a different country." Very 
little time is left before the fundamentalists take over 
Algeria. The terrorists in Egypt, who wish to establish a 
fundamentalist order, have frustrated the people to such an 
extent that they are almost ready to embrace the "Islamic 
Brotherhood Organization," which has been a problem in that 
country since 1928. The secular system in Tunisia is 
maintaining its existence with great difficulty. Meanwhile, 
King Hassan has had the largest mosque in the world constructed 
in Morocco to secure the support of the fundamentalists in his 
country. The reports from Bangladesh and Pakistan are 
demoralizing. The Islamic way of life, which Prosperity Party 
Leader Necmettin Erbakan has described as "just order," is 
supposed to bring peace to the people. However, it has created 
a fratricide in Afghanistan. 
  All that is an indication of the present situation in many 
of 
the countries that said "Iran is a different country" 15 years 
ago. 
  Meanwhile, the United States has moved to consider "how to 
improve Washington's relations with the countries that have 
adopted the Islamic order." That indicates that no one will 
support the prosecular forces in a country when their secular 
system is removed. In view of this, we must abandon the view 
that "the secular system will not collapse" and adopt the 
approach that "the secular system will collapse if we do not 
support it." We must be skeptical and not heed the views of 
apathetic and imprudent people like Husamettin Cindoruk and 
former Social Democratic People's Party Leader Erdal Inonu. We 
must be aware that we shall never again be able to see the light 
of contemporary civilization if our secular system collapses.

the notion of discrimination between Islam and canonical law in

front."

Muslim obliges the GUP to adopt an anti-Kemalist stand or at

to pursue a contrived policy that wavers between Kemalism and so 
called anti-Kemalism."

such things as the Idealist movement and Turkish-Islamic 
synthesis. One cannot combine Turkish nationalism and Islam. 
Islam comes first."

them freedom. The Kurdish problem is a regional issue."

  [Text] The economic stability package has begun to yield 
its first results. The Ministry of Finance, which, for many 
years, disclosed that the budget had a deficit, said yesterday 
that for the first time the budget had a surplus in May. The 
surplus totaled 6.3 trillion Turkish lira [TL]. 
  The budget deficit, which totaled TL55.5 trillion from 
January to April 1994, decreased to 49.1 trillion in May. The 
deficit was estimated to total 10.8 trillion from April to June. 
However, the budget had a surplus of 2.2 trillion from April to 
May. 
  Turkey paid TL6 trillion on its foreign debts in May. That 
figure, however, was transferred to the accounts in June. 
Consequently, the budget indicated a surplus in May. Compared 
with May 1993, the tax revenues, which make up the most 
important part of the budget revenues, increased by 89.9 percent 
to total TL162.6 trillion in May 1994. 
  The budget revenues covered 70.7 percent of the budget 
spending in May 1993. They covered 81.5 percent of the budget 
spending in May 1994.

<F P=106> [Report by Gungor Mengi: "Bad Habit"--all figures as </F>
published] 
  [Text] Minister of Finance Atilla made a favorable 
disclosure on the budget yesterday. He confirmed claims that 
the budget deficit has been removed and budget spending is under 
control. That has inspired hope for the future. However, the 
hope must be supported by confidence, without which investments 
and production cannot be increased. 
  According to Atilla's disclosure, the budget deficit, which 
totaled 51.3 trillion Turkish lira [TL] from January to March 
1994, decreased by TL4.3 trillion in April. The situation 
further improved in May. The budget had a surplus of TL6.3 
trillion. Meanwhile, compared with May 1993, tax revenues 
covered an additional 6 percent of the budget spending in May 
1994. 
  However, the footnote in the Finance Ministry's disclosure 
has caused dissatisfaction. It said that the amount paid for 
the interest on Turkey's foreign debts in May, which totaled 
TL6.5 trillion, was not included in the budget spending for that 
month. That amount should have been included in the 
calculations because Turkey paid the interest on its debts in 
cash. Why should the Finance Ministry resort to trickery? 
Obviously, its objective was to exaggerate its success in 
reducing the budget deficit. It would still have been 
successful even if the amount paid for Turkey's foreign debts 
was included on the balance sheet for May. A deficit of only 
TL200 billion would have been seen on the balance sheet. 
Obviously, the trickery was aimed at creating an opportunity 
for the government to convince the people that its budget 
incurred a surplus for the first time. That was not necessary. 
  Those who are aware of the situation will not be misled. If 
the government wished to deceive the people, then that is 
another matter. However, risking the loss of the people's trust 
for the sake of undeserved appreciation is a stupid approach.

<F P=106> [By Ali Sirmen from the "The World Today" column: "The </F>
Standard of Living in the Southeast"] 
  [Excerpts] In a statement he made after the meeting of the 
State of Emergency Coordination Council which he heads, Interior 
Minister Nahit Mentese said "Everything will be done to raise 
the standard of living in the southeast." 
  It is understood from Mr. Mentese's statements that the 
state 
is not considering any measures for the southeast except for 
investments. Unfortunately, it is impossible to say that the 
approach of the state is healthy or realistic. It is true that 
the Kurdish problem has an economic aspect as well, but contrary 
to what certain fanatical circles claim, it is not because the 
area was left deliberately backward. It is because the area is 
in the periphery of Turkey, a peripheral country itself. There 
is no doubt that it is necessary and useful to eliminate these 
economic imbalances. 
  The population growth rate in this area is almost double 
that 
of other areas in Turkey. It is impossible for the state to end 
unemployment here in the short run. It is impossible for any 
state to do that, not only the Turkish republican state. 
  According to official figures given at the end of last year, 
when the dollar was around 15,000 Turkish Lira [TL], it was 
necessary to invest some TL2 billion to create one job. It is 
not difficult to estimate the level of investment needed today, 
when the dollar moves between TL32,000 to TL35,000. 
  While existing workplaces are being closed down given the 
economic crisis we are in, where will the state find the 
resources to invest to create job opportunities for so many 
unemployed? 
  Granted, the state has a huge investment project in the 
area. 
The GAP [Southeast Anatolia Project] is one of the largest and 
most ambitious projects in the world. However, GAP investments 
were halted some time ago. Not even the Urfa tunnel has been 
opened yet to irrigate the Harran. Another 20 to 30 years are 
needed to complete this project. It seems impossible to 
maintain its regular pace, let alone speed up its completion. 
The cost is constantly rising. 
  The GAP issue was discussed at the coordination meeting and 
justifiably the participants expressed the hope that efforts 
will be made to complete the project. Unfortunately, these 
hopes will not materialize because the state does not have the 
means to go on with the project. 
  For years, the state has been trying to solve the problem of 
unemployment in the southeast by means of emigration. Not only 
does this method fail to bring a real solution to the problem, 
but it changes and expands the geography of unemployment and 
creates new problems. 
  As for the issue of encouraging the private sector to invest 
in the region: Regardless of the kind of encouragement, it is 
impossible to persuade any private investor to invest in the 
area under the present circumstances. 
  Furthermore, due to the feudal structure and power relations 
in the area, it is highly probable that the fruits of any 
investment will be seized by the handful of sovereign elements 
there. [passage omitted] 
  In other words, despite his goodwill, the policy announced 
by 
Mr. Mentese is neither realistic nor helpful. 
  We believe that the first steps that must be taken for the 
solution of he problem are democratic measures that do not cost 
economically but that will more effectively meet certain demands.

<F P=106> [By Nur Batur from the "The Diplomacy Corridor" column: </F>
"The Secret Turkish-Russian War in NATO"] 
  [Text] Who will win the Turkish-Russian war currently 
being waged behind closed doors at the NATO Ministerial Council 
meetings in Istanbul? 
  We are really curious. 
  This time, Turkey faces a different situation than in the 
Cold War period with regard to the Russian threat, over which 
there is renewed concern. The United States and other Western 
allies appear to have abandoned the entire Caucasus and Central 
Asia to Russian hegemony, in exchange for East Europe. The 
Turkish Administration, in turn, is losing sleep over this. 
  In actual fact, developments in the Caucasus are a source of 
great concern. 
  What are the developments that led even General Dogan Gures, 
chief of the General Staff, to openly refer to the Russian 
threat? 
  Approximately one year ago, Russia demanded raising the 
ceiling on the number of weapons allowed in the Caucasus within 
the framework of the CFE [Conventional Armed Forces in Europe] 
agreement. Naturally, Turkey was the first country that reacted 
against this demand. 
  The reaction of the West to this demand, which was raised 
immediately following Yeltsin's artillery fire against the 
Russian parliament "in the name of democracy," was initially 
inadequate as far as Turkey's expectations were concerned. At 
the time, the United States even indicated that the CFE may be 
renegotiated. In the wake of pressure from Ankara, however, 
NATO started to insist on remaining loyal to the agreement. 
  The distance covered by Russia during this time is very 
important. Russian Defense Minister Grachev even threatened to 
violate the agreement if the demand to raise the ceiling is not 
accepted. 
  As it happens, during this time, Russia staged a skillful 
scenario. Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, who did not 
favor sending Russian troops to the region, and Armenian 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan now agree with Russia. Russia 
concluded defense cooperation agreements with both these 
countries and has begun amassing weapons in the region under the 
banner of peace forces. 
  The CFE allows Georgia and Armenia to deploy 220 tanks each 
in the area. Both these countries allocated 150 from their 
respective quotas to Russia. Moreover, Russia is also relying 
on Article 5 of the CFE, which allows for "temporary 
deployment." In this way, Yeltsin is side-stepping the CFE and 
amassing forces in the Caucasus. 
  The only country that resists this Russian plot is 
Azerbaijan. It is a fact that Azerbaijani President Aliyev is in 
an extremely difficult position. The fact that 15-20 days ago, 
Grachev invited the Armenian and Azerbaijani defense ministers 
to Moscow and announced that the Azerbaijanis have also agreed 
to a Russian peace force clearly demonstrates the Russian 
pressure. 
  The fact is, however, that the United States refuses to see 
this intensive pressure on the part of Russia to reamass forces 
in the Caucasus. And Turkey is left alone in its struggle 
against Russia. If, eventually, Russia succeeds in subduing 
Azerbaijan as well, the number of tanks it will deploy in the 
whole of the Caucasus will reach 1,800. Turkey is engaged in a 
truly difficult struggle. 
  In their joint communique, the NATO foreign ministers may 
issue a call to comply with the CFE. Can such a call eliminate 
the secret agreement that leaves the Caucasus in the hands of 
the Russians? 
  If such an agreement does not exist, the United States and 
NATO should not remain spectators to the plot staged by Russia.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Oktay Eksi: "What Was Said To Mislead Us in </F>
the Past?"] 
  [Text] The Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] will 
convene to approve the government's motion for the extension of 
the Hammer Force mandate in Turkey today. In view of the fact 
that the matter is a topical issue, we have decided to focus on 
"how and when the question of Hammer Force began and what was 
said on the matter at the time." I discovered an interesting 
report when I studied the documents, a report that has been 
overlooked for one reason or another. It said that the Council 
of Ministers has agreed that "Turkey should assign a contingent 
of troops to the military force, which will be established 
within the CSCE framework and based in Erzurum to prevent the 
war between Armenia and Azerbaijan." That shows that the 
Turkish Government has decided to open our country's door to a 
multinational force before sending off the one that is already 
based on our territory. 
  Let us recall a basic point: A foreign military unit in any 
country will take away something from that country's 
independence, honor, and esteem. That will not change even if 
the presence of that military unit is called for by the host 
country. The invitation a country extends to a foreign military 
unit will automatically give it the right to express its opinion 
on that country's affairs and problems and even interfere in its 
activities. Therefore, what is important for a country is "not 
to be in a position to have to call for the deployment of a 
foreign military unit in its territory." 
  In view of that, it is difficult to understand why Turkish 
officials have agreed to the deployment of a multinational force 
in Turkey for one reason or another when the problem of the 
Hammer Force has not yet been resolved. It is common knowledge 
that the reason Hammer Force has been deployed in Turkey is 
still vague. Furthermore, the activities and objectives of that 
force are debatable. 
  Before we say anything else, we wish to ask the following: 
What has happened that our Western allies have decided to take 
action on the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan when they 
failed to act against the violation of the UN Charter and the 
CSCE principles in Bosnia and condoned the Armenian attacks 
against Azerbaijan for a very long time? Is it a coincidence 
that the two problems, which have prompted them to agree to 
dispatch military units to Turkey, are linked to matters that 
were upheld by the Sevres Agreement but rejected by the Lausanne 
Agreement in the past? The plan to give part of Turkey's 
territory to the State of Armenia was in line with the spirit of 
the Sevres Agreement. That approach was rejected by the 
Lausanne Agreement. 
  Let us return to the question of Hammer Force. It is common 
knowledge that Hammer Force is former President Turgut Ozal's 
legacy. He is the person who advised former President Bush on 
the deployment of an international military force in Turkey to 
prevent Saddam Husayn from oppressing the Kurds in northern 
Iraq. Ozal is the person to be blamed for the problem that 
military force has caused to Turkey. Furthermore, it is common 
knowledge that Ozal advised the U.S. officials to put pressure 
on the Turkish Government before the TGNA debated the extension 
of the Hammer Force mandate. The newspapers reported that on 2 
May 1992. 
  Preparations were made for the deployment of Hammer Force in 
Turkey in July 1991. With a view to convincing the Turkish 
public of the necessity of that force, the then Prime Minister 
Mesut Yilmaz said: "A decision has been adopted to the effect 
that Hammer Force should seek the approval of the Turkish 
Government for a cross-border operation." 
  We wish to ask the following: Aside from Hammer Force 
seeking the Turkish Government's approval for its cross-border 
activities, has anyone heard or read a report that it has 
informed Turkey on any one of its numerous operations in 
northern Iraq so far? 
  Do you realize what that means? It means that there is no 
way for Ankara to be aware of a move by Hammer Force which may 
create a war between Turkey and Iraq. Do you realize the threat 
behind that state of affairs? 
  Furthermore, it is common knowledge that a number of 
officials stressed in the past that "Hammer Force can be 
withdrawn from Turkey in three months and the Turkish Government 
will be careful not to allow the presence of that force to set 
an example in the long run." The government's decision to "allow 
the deployment of an international CSCE force in Erzurum for the 
obstruction of the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan" has 
proved that the officials lied in the past.

<F P=106> [Article by Erol Manisali: "Cyprus: A Test of the West's </F>
Stance Towards Turkey"] 
  [Text] The post cold war period has been marked by problems 
in the Balkans, the Caucasus and in the Middle East. The 
European Union's [EU] and the United States' post cold war 
approach to the region is the main cause of the conflicts. In 
the Balkans the EU and the United States could have stopped the 
dissolution of the former Yugoslavia from the start. But no 
strict measures were taken by the Allies, the United States and 
the EU against the Serbs. In the Caucasus, Armenian aggression 
was supported by some European countries, the United States and 
the Russian Federation as a result of pressure by Armenian 
settlers in the United States and in France. 
  Greek aggressiveness in the Balkans, in the Aegean and in 
Cyprus has been, directly or indirectly, supported by the United 
States and the EU. In North Iraq, the Kurdish formation of an 
autonomous administration has also been directly supported by 
the United States, France and the United Kingdom. 
  Despite the existence of a pro-U.S. and pro-EU government in 
Ankara, the Turkish people and Turkish public opinion do not 
find it easy to understand in order to evaluate favorably the 
West's approach to the developments in the Balkans, the Caucasus 
and in the Middle East (North Iraq). 
  The fundamentalist Refah Party's last victory in March 1994 
is a result of a reevaluation of policies in Turkey at home and 
abroad. The failure of the Western-oriented main political 
parties in Turkey is not due mainly to domestic developments; 
foreign affairs and the stance of the West regarding the 
developments in the region, which is not largely favorable to 
Turkey's expectations have resulted in the reevaluation of 
foreign and domestic policy by the Turkish public. 
  The large majority of Turkish intellectuals and influential 
circles supports new policies towards the United States, the EU 
and NATO. 
  Since the beginning of the Gulf War (1990), developments in 
the Gulf (and N. Iraq), in the Balkans and in the Caucasus have 
demonstrated the new policy of the United States and the EU to 
isolate Turkey. The United States and the EU have lost their 
reliability in the eyes of the Turkish public. The continuation 
of the existing policies in the West in the region has created 
anti-western feelings in Turkey. 
  The West's stance in the Turkish-Greek and Turkish-Armenian 
relations (or conflicts) is not compatible with justice and 
peace in the region. 
  It is difficult for Turkey to understand the pressure from 
the United States and the EU regarding a solution of the Cyprus 
issue. 
  The Turkish public believes that, first of all, the United 
States and the EU have to accept the existence of two separate 
political establishments in Cyprus (two states on the island), 
then try to secure their cooperation, instead of ignoring one of 
the political establishments in the island, which is the Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus. 
  This is a vital political question for Turkey today, and a 
test of the attitude of the West towards Turkey. Artificial 
pressures by the West on unreal problems on the island have been 
feeding anti-Western feelings in Turkey. 
  With the support of certain international circles, the U.N. 
Secretary General has been trying to get the two sides (Turks 
and Greeks) on the island to intermingle, a policy which is 
bound to create new problems between the two peoples. Turkey 
will never accept a solution which ignores the independence and 
political integrity of the Turkish people there. None of the 
governments in Ankara is able to agree to any solution which 
provides for Greek domination of the island. If this reality is 
not understood by the United States and the EU, Turkey's 
relations with the West will be seriously harmed.

  [Text] For Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd 
al-Majid the result of the Austrian referendum on European Union 
[EU] membership is "a massive boost for Austria's role and 
importance in the world." During a meeting with President 
Thomas Klestil in Vienna's Hofburg Palace, he said that by 
clearly saying yes to a larger Europe Austria "has regained 
that central position which the country had assumed for 
centuries." The Arab and the Islamic world is pleased about the 
result of the Austrian EU referendum also because it knows that 
it now has one more close and trustworthy friend in the EU. 
President Thomas Klestil, who a few hours before had received 
the OPEC ministers who are meeting in Vienna, expressed his 
conviction that Austria's opinion and advice in the EU will be 
in particularly high demand in the future when the cooperation 
of the EU with East Europe, but also with the Middle East, will 
be the issue. Since the time of [former Austrian Chancellor] 
Bruno Kreisky, Austria's special closeness with the Arab world 
has been known and appreciated. In the meeting with the Arab 
League secretary general President Klestil discussed, among 
other things, current developments in Bosnia, the Middle East 
peace process, and political and social development in Africa. 
'Ismat 'Abd al-Majid, who is in Vienna to visit the UN 
organizations, was accompanied by Arab League Deputy Secretary 
General Ahmed Adel and Arab League representative in Austria 
Samir Hezzah [preceding two Arab names spelling as published].

<F P=106> [Article by Colette Braeckman: "The Lead of the Two </F>
Frenchmen: Continued"] 
  [Text] The theory put forward yesterday by LE SOIR, based 
on corroborated information, that two members of the French 
military may have been involved in the attack on 6 April on the 
aircraft carrying the Rwandan and Burundian presidents, has 
brought numerous and lively reactions. In France, the 
government issued a denial during the morning of publication 
stating that this "allegation" is "absurd" and pointing out 
that, at the time of the attack, there were just 25 French 
military left in Kigali, all employed on very specific tasks. 
  In Brussels, the Foreign Ministry and the prime minister 
stated that they had no information to support the theory. Mr. 
Dehaene, leaving LE SOIR responsible for its information, stated 
that "the theory put forward was not within the scope of the 
enquiry being pursued by the military authorities." It is true 
that, in the strictest sense, the enquiry being conducted by the 
military authorities only concerns the circumstances in which 
the 10 Belgian blue helmets died in Kigali. But colleagues at 
the RTBF [French-language Belgian Radio and Television], who 
also contacted the military authorities, were told on Friday [17 
June] that the theory of white mercenaries, including some 
French, remained open with respect to the attack on 6 April. 
  The denials from the official authorities do not answer the 
outstanding questions and, given the present status of our 
information, the lead we mentioned yesterday remains credible 
even if it is not of course certain. We are continuing to 
receive information of the return to Kigali last February of 11 
French soldiers who, until December, had been members of the 
DAMI [Military Training Assistance Detachment] and who were 
apparently recognized in civilian clothing in Kigali. 
  Shadowy areas also remain regarding the French military 
presence in Rwanda. For example: We have learned, in another 
context, that shortly after 6 April two French development 
conscripts were killed in Kigali, together with the wife of one 
of them. One of them, a member of the GIGN [National 
Gendarmerie Intervention Group], Jean-Paul Mayertz, had arrived 
in Kigali in December and was responsible for training 
activities, with the Presidential Guard in particular. 
Information given to their relatives indicates that these 
French citizens were killed by the soldiers of the Rwandan Armed 
Forces in the "lot" neighboring their residence. Their bodies 
were recovered by the blue helmets, repatriated and buried as 
discreetly as possible. To our knowledge, Paris has never 
mentioned the death of these French soldiers.

<F P=106> [Interview with OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye by </F>
Hideaki Yasuda and Tetsuji Ozuka at OECD headquarters in Paris 
on 15 June] 
  [Text] Paris, 15 June -- Questions and answers from an 
interview with Secretary General Paye: 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What are the results of the recent [OECD] 
ministerial meeting? 
  [Paye] Regarding the issues of creating economic growth and 
employment opportunities, which are the largest tasks, the 
ministers, in addition to reaching an agreement in the financial 
area, were able to agree to buckle down to the task of 
structural reform. We were also able to agree to strengthen the 
multilateral trade system, eliminate protectionism, and 
strengthen dialogue with countries that are not OECD members. 
We were able to produce overall results. However, true results 
depend on each country's future effort. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Ministers of European nations strongly 
expressed concern that low wages and low-cost goods from 
developing countries in Asia threaten the employment situation 
in Europe. 
  [Paye] I think such a concern is wrong. Since the time of 
the industrial revolution, new employment opportunities have 
been created while some industries were forced into bankruptcy 
every time a new technological invention was made. Low-cost 
goods such as textiles created problems in Europe. However, it 
is a process of economic development. What we have to do to 
overcome this process is to renovate our technologies, educate 
capable people, and review our social systems to make them suit 
the high-tech era. 
  Some people are worried that the issue of labor standards 
and 
competition -- or the issue of how far we should protect the 
rights of laborers in developing countries -- may be linked to 
protectionism in the developed countries. The OECD plans to 
make an objective analysis, which will not be affected by 
political pressure or diplomatic tension. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The amount of Japan's trade surplus is huge. 
On the other hand, its economic recovery is slow. 
  [Paye] Japan is an island, and the Japanese people still 
have 
insular views. Indeed, it is difficult for the United States and 
European countries to make inroads into the Japanese market. 
However, I do not think Japan is essentially a closed nation. 
Since it has a consistent social system and firm systems [as 
published], you need to exert efforts to understand its culture 
and how the Japanese people think if you want to do business in 
the Japanese market. It will become a most reliable partner 
once your efforts are recognized. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Japan is buckling down to the task of 
political and economic reforms. There are many problems, 
however, which will require a considerable amount of time before 
being settled. 
  [Paye] Japan's ability to adapt to a new environment and 
long-term viewpoints are highly valued. Japan is moving in the 
right direction, so we hope it will speed up the process of its 
political and economic reforms. We hope Japan will make changes 
in such areas as consumption and livelihood [shohi ya seikatsu] 
and the social system in a way that it can cooperate more than 
before with its trade partners, including the European countries 
and the United States. Some people insist on keeping things 
which are peculiar to Japan in various areas ranging from 
politics to the family system. However, I think it is also 
necessary for foreign countries occasionally to apply pressure 
on Japan to make its reforms progress more. 
  Anyhow, the standard of living in Japan has reached the 
highest level in the world. I think Japan will change more. I 
am certain that it will be obvious to everybody that Japan is 
neither an isolated protectionist nation nor a closed one. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What do you think of the Japan-U.S. 
comprehensive economic talks, in which the United States is 
assuming a stance of "emphasizing the importance of results?" 
  [Paye] It is strange that the United States is displeased 
with Japan, because the United States is suffering from a huge 
trade deficit with Japan. U.S. markets are open to many 
countries. It seems, however, that the United States thinks it 
is difficult to make inroads into markets in Japan, which has 
strong competitive power. If I may express my private opinion, 
it is dangerous to insist on bilateral negotiations between 
Japan and the United States to settle trade issues. I am 
worried about the possibility that the benefits of each nation 
may be jeopardized. Negotiations between Japan and the United 
States in limited individual areas will not be linked to 
promotion of changes in Japan. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Your second term of office will expire in 
September. Are you planning to remain in the post? 
  [Paye] I expressed my hope a year ago to remain in this post 
one more term. I have enough experience, and this is an 
interesting time of change. I am ready for it.

<F P=106> [Article signed ALB/MTH: "Claes: You Must Fight for Peace </F>
and Stability Every Day"] 
  [Text] Oslo/Brussels, 16 Jun (BELGA) -- "West Europe has 
enjoyed 50 years of peace and prosperity. Contrary to what many 
young people believe, this is not to be taken for granted. You 
must fight to maintain this stability every day," Belgian 
Foreign Minister Willy Claes declared at a NATO seminar in Oslo 
on Thursday [16 June]. 
  The Belgian minister spoke of the "new strategic triangle" 
formed by the European Union (EU), the United States, and 
Russia. "It is vitally important for all of us to build a solid 
and balanced collaboration between these three major players," 
Mr. Claes declared in a communique issued by the Foreign 
Ministry in Brussels. 
  As regards the United States, the minister welcomes the fact 
that it wishes to continue to fulfill its role in Europe, 
coupled, however, with a greater effort by the Europeans 
themselves. 
  On the subject of Russia, Claes stressed the difficulty in 
predicting the country's future, as well as its future internal 
and external policy. It was clear last week at the NATO meeting 
in Istanbul that Russia is increasingly emerging as a major 
power. The problem is also to know how Russia can be positively 
included in the "strategic triangle" of which the minister spoke. 
  As regards the EU, the minister regretted that the joint 
foreign and security policy still has a great deal of progress 
to make and that the Union does not have adequate resources to 
deal with a crisis such as in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Mr. Claes pointed out that under the Belgian EU presidency, 
no effort had been spared in promoting dialogue with the United 
States, and that the EU was going to sign a partnership 
agreement with Russia in Corfu. "It is hoped that this 
agreement will support the country's economic reforms and 
stability," the minister said.

  [Text] Paris, June 16 (CTK) -- All the Visegrad group 
countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland) 
consider joining NATO and the Western European Union (WEU) a 
priority of their foreign policies. The weakening of regional 
cooperation in Central Europe could threaten this goal, Slovak 
Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan said today. 
  Czechs, Poles, Slovaks, and Hungarians have created the 
Visegrad group to be able to "coordinate their final liberation 
from the sphere of influence of the former Soviet Union," Kukan 
told a WEU meeting. He said Slovakia considered cooperation 
between the Visegrad countries very important. Through good 
neighborly relations and cooperation with its neighbors Slovakia 
seeks to contribute to stability in Europe as well as to its own 
security, he said. However, Bratislava is expecting a similarly 
accommodating approach from its neighbors, Kukan stressed. He 
admitted that individual Visegrad countries attached different 
weight to their mutual cooperation but expressed the conviction 
that all of them understood the inevitability of close 
cooperation. 
  Kukan appealed to Western countries' representatives to 
speed 
up Central Europe's integration into its security structures. 
Cooperation with NATO and WEU and the clear prospects of 
Slovakia's membership in these organizations is necessary for 
the success of economic and democratic reforms in the country. 
"The prosperity and security are inseparably connected," he 
said, adding that the consequences of the forced division of 
Europe would disappear at the time when individual areas on the 
continent would have similar security guarantees. 
  NATO and its European pillar -- WEU are the basis of 
European 
security. That is why Slovakia is seeking to join these 
organizations. "I would like to emphasize that this orientation 
is based on the political consensus of all political entities in 
the country and on the public support," Kukan said. He pointed 
out that Slovakia had proposed that international peace-keeping 
and humanitarian forces could train on its territory. 
  Kukan rejected the view of some deputies that serious 
problems existed between Slovakia and Hungary. He also stressed 
that the division of the former Czechoslovakia did not mean that 
the Slovak population was against European integration. "We are 
expecting to join the European Union at the turn of the century, 
maybe already as soon as in 2000," Kukan said.

<F P=106> [Report by Tom Wilkie: "Nuclear Firm Chairman Attacks Delay </F>
Over Waste"] 
  [Text] One of the leaders of Britain's nuclear industry 
yesterday launched an outspoken attack on government delay and 
indecision over nuclear waste disposal. 
  According to James Hann, chairman of Scottish Nuclear, 
electricity consumers will have to pay nearly 1m pounds a week 
extra because the Government has postponed a decision on his 
company's scheme to store nuclear fuel at its power stations 
rather than send it for reprocessing. 
  Mr Hann voiced the frustration of the industry when he told 
a 
press conference in London that "every time our industry tries 
to take a step forward, it is being halted in its tracks as a 
result of operating in the public sector." 
  He was speaking as Scottish Nuclear announced a 9 per cent 
increase in net profits last year to 72m pounds from 66m pounds. 
In the past, Scottish Nuclear has been diplomatic in its 
dealings with government. 
  It has also been reluctant to embrace privatisation, 
believing that issues of nuclear waste disposal and 
decommissioning need to be addressed first. 
  But Mr Hann yesterday demanded the freedom "to do what we 
were asked to do -- to run our companies in the most commercial, 
and safest, ways possible. If remaining in the public sector is 
going to seriously hinder our progress then partial or even full 
privatisation may indeed be the best way forward." 
  Scottish Nuclear put forward in 1991 its idea that spent 
nuclear fuel should be kept in "dry stores" next to its two 
nuclear power stations in Lothian and Ayrshire, rather than 
being sent to British Nuclear Fuel's Sellafield plant for 
reprocessing. The company estimated this would save 45m pounds 
a year. The proposal was investigated by a public inquiry 18 
months ago. 
  Mr Hann said: "Although the reporter to the inquiry stated 
our plans were sound on both engineering and safety grounds, the 
Secretary of State for Scotland has decided that the Department 
of the Environment's waste review should consider whether there 
should be one national dry store or stores sited at each nuclear 
power plant."

eastern Zairian town of Goma, near the Rwandan border, to assess 
under what conditions a force intervening in Rwanda could 
transit through Zaire. 
  A representative of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is 
expected in Paris today. He will meet French leading officials. 
This was announced by Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin in a

<F P=106> [Report by Martin S. Lambeck: "Bonn Hesitates With Aid to </F>
Rwanda"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn/Paris -- In case of a French intervention 
in the African civil war country of Rwanda, the Federal 
Government will not provide logistical aid or become otherwise 
involved for the time being. Despite very early information by 
the French about the forthcoming intervention and despite a 
request for support, Bonn has refused. 
  However, the Chancellor's Office, the Foreign Ministry, and 
the Defense Ministry in Bonn intend to permit humanitarian 
relief flights by the Air Force as soon as the Kigali airport is 
secured and is firmly held by the French. This would involve 
the supply of pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs. Any participation 
in a military action must, however, be renounced until the 
Federal Constitutional Court has ruled on the Bundeswehr's 
missions abroad. Such a ruling is expected this July. Among 
the political leadership of the Defense Ministry, it is said: 
"The ruling of the Constitutional Court has absolute priority 
for us." 
  France had asked Germany, Italy, and Belgium to participate 
in the planned intervention. French Government officials had 
pointed to the strategic partnership between the two countries. 
However, both Bonn and Rome refused to participate. Italy's 
Defense Minister Cesare Previti said yesterday that Italy is not 
willing to send troops. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Innocenzo Kabera, Rwandan </F>
Patriotic Front spokesman in Italy, by Renato Caprile in 
Brindisi; date not given: "Italy, Do Not Side With the French!" 
-- first two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- "The French would do well to stay at home. 
They could have stopped the massacre of our people by 
exercising pressure on their murderer friends, but they did not 
do so. So what do they want now? That we help them ease their 
bad consciences? That is a bit too much. If they think they 
can hoodwink us with a humanitarian aid charade, they are very 
mistaken. If they set foot in Rwanda -- and last time they did 
they stayed on for four years -- we will make them regret it 
bitterly." 
  Speaking over the phone from Brindisi, Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] spokesman Innocenzo Kabera did not even attempt to 
use diplomatic tones. He went straight to the heart of the 
matter. It was enough to whisper the word "French" to see him 
blow his top. 
  [Caprile] Why, then, are you so hostile to France, Mr. 
Kabera? 
  [Kabera] Because we cannot forget the fact that, if all that 
is now left in our country is heaps of corpses, if thousands of 
children have been wounded in their bodies and their minds, we 
owe this precisely to the French. It was they who first 
trained, and then armed and supported the government's troops, 
the death squads. What are they coming for? To stop the 
massacre? Too late, it already took place. In all the towns we 
conquered, we found nothing but dead people. So, are they 
coming to negotiate so that an agreement can be reached between 
the parts? Come off it! What sort of credibility can 
accomplices in genocide have in peace talks? Furthermore, whom 
are they coming to negotiate with? Not with us, certainly. 
  [Caprile] So you do not want the French. What about 
Italians, who over the past few days have been discussing 
whether or not to send a blue helmet contingent to Rwanda? 
  [Kabera] I have been living in Italy for years. I can say I 
know Italians well. I know that, from Lebanon to Somalia and 
Mozambique -- wherever they went -- they worked well, but if 
they should embark on a joint operation with the French, we will 
have no choice: We will fight against what we consider 
occupation forces in our country. 
  [Caprile] Yet Italy has already fully proven its good faith 
through Mariapia Fanfani's two missions. 
  [Kabera] I repeat: We feel genuine friendship and gratitude 
toward Italy. We may even trust Italians, but we will not if 
they come led by the French. 
  [Caprile] So, are you not opposed, in principle, to 5,500 UN 
blue helmets being sent? 
  [Kabera] Of course not. We cannot but agree with the UN 
initiative, provided that it is strictly neutral. The UN 
Security Council has voted a resolution to send troops capable 
of ensuring protection for the civilians who are at risk. We 
agree with this. But the French should not be part of the 
mission. They are not neutral. For them, humanitarian aid is 
just a facade. They only want to come to enable the butchers of 
our people to save face, they do not want to come to help 
suffering people, but only their friends, who are our enemies. 
  [Caprile] What does "help" mean in your view? 
  [Kabera] As everybody knows, this war flares up 
periodically. 
This means that if the government's army is not disarmed, you 
can be sure that, within a year or two, it will begin again. 
[Kabera ends] 
  As further proof that the Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels are 
absolutely determined to prevent French blue helmets from being 
sent to Rwanda, Kabera announced a great protest demonstration 
to be held in Rome in the next few days. "We will take to the 
streets," he explained, "to let people know about the crimes 
committed by [French President] Mitterrand and company during 
the genocide of our people."

<F P=106> [Report by Ewa Svensson: "Great Happiness in Denmark"] </F>
  [Text] Denmark's Social Democratic prime minister 
expressed great satisfaction with the Swedish bridge decision on 
Thursday [16 Jun], while the Christian People's Party, a member 
of the coalition government, said that it can only accept a 
tunnel and is demanding new Oresund negotiations after this 
fall's Danish elections. 
  "I am happy that we can continue with the project with full 
security for the environment," Prime Minister Poul Nyrup 
Rasmussen said, adding that from the environmental viewpoint the 
Oresund bridge is best-investigated bridge project ever. 
  "The work on the coast-to-coast link can now get under way 
at 
the same time that the work on land on the Danish side can 
resume," the prime minister said. 
  "I am extremely happy," said Transportation Minister Jan 
Trojborg, who believes that the timetable for the construction 
of the bridge and the financial framework for the project will 
hold, despite the "tardy" Swedish decision. 
  "Compared with the link across the Great Belt, the Oresund 
bridge is a much simpler technical construction," Trojborg said. 
  Kaj Ikast, his predecessor, was the man who signed the 
agreement with Sweden in 1991, and he called the Swedish 
decision "strong, important, and courageous." 
  In 1991 the Christian People's Party did not back the bridge 
decision, and Ole M. Nielsen, the party's environment spokesman, 
is calling for new negotiations within the government on the 
Oresund bridge after this fall's elections.

  [Text] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz has 
declared that linking the U.S. military aid to Turkey to issues 
other than security and to certain conditions is unacceptable. 
Yilmaz, who is currently in the United States for the World 
Forum meetings, began his contacts in Washington. TRT 
correspondent Yavuz Yorulmaz reports from Washington: 
  [Begin Yorulmaz recording] Yilmaz first met with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. In a statement after the 
20-minute meeting, Yilmaz said that bilateral relations and the 
developments in Turkey's region were assessed with Christopher. 
Yilmaz reported that during the meeting he emphasized that it is 
unacceptable to Turkey to link the military aid to conditions. 
Yilmaz said: Relating this subject to matters other than 
security -- such as terrorism, against which Turkey is 
struggling in a very legitimate way; or the Cyprus problem, a 
national issue which Turkey has been following for 20 years -- 
is an unacceptable situation for Turkey. 
  Yilmaz said that Christopher, in turn, remarked that the 
U.S. 
Administration does not find it appropriate to link the military 
aid to Turkey to conditions and that it will intervene with 
Congress on this matter. Yilmaz noted that he also informed the 
U.S. secretary of state that the Turkish public has serious 
concerns regarding Poised Hammer and that this concern is 
related to Iraq's territorial integrity. 
  Pointing out that during the meeting he also briefed 
Christopher on the work conducted in Turkey with regard to 
constitutional amendments, Yilmaz added: I conveyed to 
Christopher that it would be extremely wrong to confuse 
terrorism with the human rights issue, that the Turkish state 
will in no way renounce its legitimate struggle against 
terrorism, but that this struggle should not distract us from 
certain steps we must take in the area of human rights. 
  Yilmaz said that during the meeting, he expressed the view 
that the U.S. Congress decision to impose an embargo on 
Azerbaijan is very unjust and that the U.S. Administration 
should adopt a more balanced attitude with regard to the 
Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. 
  The ANAP leader later met with some members of the U.S. 
Congress at a luncheon hosted in his honor by Turkish Ambassador 
Nuzhet Kandemir. In a speech at the dinner, Yilmaz stated that 
Turkey's importance increased further in the wake of the Cold 
War and that Turkey is playing a constructive role in its 
region. [end recording]

  [Text] Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov has arrived on 
an official visit in Ankara as the guest of President Suleyman 
Demirel. At Esenboga Airport Niyazov was received by Demirel. 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and other officials were also 
present at the ceremony. 
  In reply to a question by a correspondent from the Turkmen 
television, Demirel expressed his satisfaction in welcoming 
Niyazov in Ankara. He said: Turkmenistan is our ancestral 
homeland. Turkey is your and my precious brother Niyazov's 
second motherland. Pointing out that Turkey's relations with 
Turkmenistan have developed excellently in the last two and a 
half years, Demirel said that positive developments can be 
observed in bilateral relations. 
  [Begin Demirel recording] We will review everything. We 
will give them another push. I remember Niyazov's last visit to 
Turkey three years ago. Our relations since then have developed 
as though these three years were actually 30. We extend our 
love and greetings to our brethren in Turkmenistan. We will 
work together for the happiness of these two brotherly peoples. 
I am very happy that I am extending my love and my greetings to 
the Turkmen people through this television that is being 
inaugurated today. Our good relations will continue for 
eternity. Long live Turkish-Turkmen cooperation and 
brotherhood. [end recording] 
  An official welcoming ceremony for Niyazov was held at the 
Cankaya Mansion. After the national anthems of the two 
countries were played, the two presidents inspected the honor 
guard. Acting Assembly Speaker Kamer Genc, Deputy Chief of 
Staff General Ahmet Corekci, Cetin, Agricultural and Village 
Affairs Minister Refaiddin Sahin, Energy and Natural Resource 
Minister Veysel Atasoy, and other ministers were present at the 
ceremony. 
  Addressing the ceremony, Demirel said: I welcome you from 
our ancestral land Central Asia, Turkmenistan, to your second 
homeland, Turkey. Pointing out that there exist special, strong 
and deep-rooted ties based on a joint history between the two 
countries, Demirel added that the adjective Turk in the names of 
both peoples descending from the great Oghuz tribes is the best 
symbol of these special ties. He noted that the bilateral 
relations and cooperation, which were based on a strong 
foundation in the aftermath of Turkmenistan's independence, are 
developing speedily in line with the will and wishes of the two 
peoples. He added that the relations and cooperation in 
question will gain a new impetus and strength as a result of 
Niyazov's visit. 
  [Begin Demirel recording] We are observing with appreciation 
the reforms and developments Turkmenistan has accomplished under 
the efficient leadership of Niyazov in all walks of state and 
community life as well as the contributions it has made to peace 
and stability in Central Asia. We believe that brotherly 
Turkmenistan, which is an important country in the region, will 
best use all its resources to overcome the obstacles and 
difficulties of this transition period and that it will become a 
developed and prosperous country. Turkey will continue its 
policy of aid to and support for Turkmenistan. [end recording] 
  Demirel stated that Turkish firms have undertaken 
significant 
projects worth $1.28 billion in Turkmenistan. Noting that there 
are some 2,600 Turkmen students studying with scholarships in 
Turkey, Demirel stressed that communications and travel between 
the two countries are increasing. Demirel said: 
  Turkish-Turkmen relations are based on equality, 
noninterference in domestic affairs, mutual interests, love, and 
respect. Our relations and cooperation also serve regional 
development, prosperity, stability, and peace. Our relations 
should, naturally, be further advanced. The two sides have the 
political will to achieve that goal. These points will be taken 
up in my talks with my brother Niyazov. Furthermore, we will 
exchange views on regional problems concerning our countries and 
international issues. 
  Niyazov said that such visits, which have become a 
tradition, 
constitute an opportunity to review the developments that have 
been achieved so far. He stated that the two countries have 
great potential, adding that the administrators of these two 
countries should make the most of these great opportunities. 
Niyazov, who will begin his official contacts tomorrow, will 
leave Turkey on 29 June.

  [Excerpts] The UN Security Council is preparing to discuss 
again tonight a resolution authorizing France to head a 
humanitarian operation in Rwanda. [passage omitted] 
  This evening the OAU--the Organization of African Unity--is 
refusing to support this intervention. In particular, the OAU 
is raising the dangers that such an operation could entail. 
Ghislaine Dupont has just spoken on the telephone to Pascal 
Gayana, deputy secretary general of the organization: 
  [Begin Gayana recording] The OAU is expressing a position as 
a continental organization. On the whole, it was surprised to 
see that a member of the United Nations had initiated an 
individual action at a time when the pan-African organization 
had embarked upon an action at the Tunis summit for which it 
hoped to get the support of the members of the international 
community--including France, of course. It is something of a 
surprise for us. We think this is a surprise, given that the 
African states had committed themselves to supplying troops in 
accordance with the relevant resolution of the United Nations on 
Unamir and were waiting for the members of the international 
community and of the Security Council, in particular, to supply 
as agreed the necessary means. 
  We understand, in a general way, the motives as they have 
been set forth by France, but we are sorry that this was not 
done in a concerted framework. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  On the French side--despite the various fears and 
controversies-- there is still an obvious determination to act, 
but Prime Minister Edouard Balladur did, nevertheless, tone down 
his speech to the deputies this afternoon. He named five [as 
heard] conditions that appear to limit the scope of the 
intervention. Bernard Pons, chairman of the Rally for the 
Republic group in the Assembly, listed them: 
  [Begin Pons recording] The first is that the intervention 
should be done with the authorization of the United Nations. 
  The second is that all precautions should be taken in order 
to set a time limit for this operation. 
  The third is that there should under no circumstances be any 
operations in the heart of Rwandan territory, but the bases for 
the intervention should be in a neighboring country, at the 
borders of a neighboring country, in Zairean territory. 
  Balladur also pointed out that other countries must take 
part 
in the operation. I think as far as Europe is concerned he has 
agreement from Italy, and a certain number of African countries 
have given their agreement. I do not yet know how they will 
participate. 
  So there are some conditions that the prime minister regards 
as essential. A number of deputies have expressed, not 
reservations, but concerns. The prime minister has told them 
that he quite understood these concerns, and this was why he 
believed there were a number of conditions that it was essential 
to respect. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F>
Jutta Vogel; place and date not given: "Woerner Is Already 
Drinking Beer Again"] 
  [Text] [Vogel] Mr. Woerner, how are you? 
  [Woerner] I feel better, my health is improving. The 
doctors tell me that "things are looking up." That is what I 
think too. I have gained 18 pounds and have recovered my 
appetite. Yesterday, my wife brought me a bottle of beer and 
the tomato soup that I am so fond of. 
  [Vogel] You have worked every day since your last 
operation..... 
  [Woerner] Unfortunately, it was a question of duty for me. 
If one assumes a task, then one must carry it out, irrespective 
of whether one is well or not. The doctors warned me that I 
would have to pay the price. I hope it has not caused me too 
much harm in the long term. 
  [Vogel] Have the NATO alliance partners shown you enough 
consideration? 
  [Woerner] To this day I have had the full support of the 
alliance foreign ministers. I am pleased about that, grateful, 
and happy. 
  Following the last foreign ministers meeting in Istanbul, I 
received a letter from British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. 
He wrote to me on behalf of all his colleagues. "Look after 
yourself, and make sure that you are fully fit by the time the 
summer break is over!" U.S. Secretary of State Christopher also 
phoned me. 
  [Vogel] What gives you so much strength? 
  [Woerner] Without the support of my dear wife, without the 
enormous sympathy displayed by an incredible number of people, I 
would never have succeeded. I also read the bible every day. 
My life has acquired an entirely different meaning. My 
relationship to God plays an important role. 
  [Vogel] Today, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev will sign 
the Partnership for Peace with NATO. Do you regret that you 
will not be there? 
  [Woerner] Yes, very much so, it has always been "my baby" 
since my first visit to Moscow four years ago. It is very dear 
to my heart. 
  The former foe will now come as a friend, and I cannot be 
there. That does leave a bitter feeling. I invested so much 
energy in this partnership. The relationship between NATO and 
Russia will also play a key role in the future. 
  [Vogel] What significance will this new cooperation between 
Russia and NATO have? 
  [Woerner] It represents a great step forward on the way to 
genuine partnership. 
  [Vogel] Can the Russians now influence NATO decisions? 
  [Woerner] We will, of course, hold consultations with the 
Russians on important security policy questions, especially in 
those areas where Russia can make a special contribution. 
However, we have not given the Russians a veto right. We will 
also continue talking to our partner states. 
  [Vogel] Is this the first step toward full membership of 
NATO for Russia? 
  [Woerner] No, not at all. There should not be any 
misunderstandings in this respect. The impression should not 
arise that we want to carve up the world together with the 
Russians, to grant the Russians the right participate in 
decisionmaking. I do not envisage Russia's full membership of 
NATO being possible in the foreseeable future. 
  [Vogel] When will you be back at NATO headquarters in 
Brussels? 
  [Woerner] I want to get back as quickly as possible. I am 
being looked after by fantastic doctors. I owe my life to them. 
I am optimistic, but, of course, no one can say exactly how my 
condition will develop. I want to be fit again by the end of 
the summer break.

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, June 21 (AFP) -- The European Union's [EU] 
Greek presidency called on EU leaders here Tuesday [21 June] to 
seek rapid compromise in the choice of a candidate to replace 
Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. 
  Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said it was of 
"capital importance" that the EU leaders name a successor to 
Delors at their summit on the Greek island of Corfu on Friday 
and Saturday. 
  In a letter to the leaders outlining the summit's agenda, he 
said failure to do so would not leave the European Parliament 
enough time to properly ratify the eventual nominee before he is 
due to take office on January 5. 
  Diplomats here have predicted that the EU leaders might not 
be able to break their deadlock at Corfu. 
  Germany and France are backing Belgian Prime Minister 
Jean-Luc Dehaene for the job. 
  But outgoing Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers has said he 
wants the position on the grounds that the Netherlands is alone 
among the EU's six founding members never to have held the job 
for a full term. 
  The nominee must be chosen unanimously. A third official 
candidate is the EU's British trade commissioner, Sir Leon 
Brittan, who has the support of London. 
  Papandreou warned that delaying the decision would mean 
cutting into the European Parliament's ratification time and 
thereby violate "the letter and the spirit of the Maastricht 
Treaty." 
  The treaty, which came into effect in November last year, 
gives the European Parliament the enhanced right to accept or 
reject the EU's nomination for president and his colleagues on 
the EU Commission. 
  However, Papandreou, who will chair the summit, said he was 
willing to accept high-level horse-trading involving candidates 
for the top positions in other international organisations. 
  The secretariat of the EU's Council of Ministers is looking 
for a new chief, as is the World Trade Organisation which will 
replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  The same applies to the Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation 
and Development (OECD) and the Western European Union, the EU's 
developing defence arm. And NATO might soon need a new 
secretary-general. 
  Heading the Corfu summit's agenda is a partnership and 
cooperation agreement between the EU and Russia. President 
Boris Yeltsin will sign the accord on Friday, after dining with 
the EU leaders on the Greek island on Thursday night. 
  Also on Friday, the EU will formally accept four new 
members. 
Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden will sign their accession 
agreements. 
  However, membership is certain only for Austria, where 
voters 
approved EU membership in a referendum earlier this month. The 
other three countries are holding referendums later this year. 
  In his letter, Papandreou invited the EU leaders to hold a 
post mortem on this month's elections to the European 
Parliament, which reflected widespread voter apathy. 
  There will also be debates on asylum policies and ways to 
fight unemployment, drug smuggling, international crime, racism 
and xenophobia. 
  The EU leaders are to discuss a joint approach to the G-7 
summit of seven industrialised countries in Naples on July 8-10. 
  The Greek leader said particular attention would be paid to 
an initiative to help finance the permanent closing of Ukraine's 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant, where the world's worst civilian 
nuclear accident occurred in 1986.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union Limits Immigrant </F>
Entry -- [Belgian Interior Minister] Tobback Would Have Liked To 
Modify Text"] 
  [Text] In Luxembourg on Monday [20 June], the European 
Union (EU) governments committed themselves to setting strict 
limits on the entry of immigrant workers into the EU. 
  "The high unemployment rates currently affecting the member 
states strengthen the need to implement community preference in 
employment," emphasized the resolution, passed on Monday in 
Luxembourg by the EU's interior and justice ministers. At 
present, the EU has 18 million unemployed, representing 
approximently 11 percent of the working population. 
  The Maastricht Treaty, which took effect in November 1993, 
gives the EU new powers in justice and home affairs. This 
resolution on immigrant workers corresponds very largely to the 
policies which the member states have been following for some 
years, a diplomatic source indicated. 
  Immigrant workers will only have access to a job in the EU 
if 
the position cannot be filled "by national and community labor 
or by noncommunity labor which has permanent and legal residence 
in the member state," the resolution states. In this case, 
immigrant workers with a work permit will be able to enter the 
EU. The resolution specifies that the member states "reserve 
the right, in accordance with their national legislation," to 
also accept the spouse and children of those workers who are 
allowed into the EU on an exceptional basis. 
  The resolution lets it be understood that seasonal work must 
be encouraged. For this purpose, immigrants will be allowed to 
stay in the EU for up to six months per year. It advises the 
national authorities to limit "the admission of these workers to 
cases where there is no reason to think that the interested 
party will seek to stay permanently on its territory." 
  Permanent workers will only be allowed to stay for a 
duration 
less than or equal to four years in a first stage. 
  Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback was concerned by the 
text's "negative tone" and indicated to his colleagues that he 
would have liked to see some modifications, while maintaining 
the resolution's main principles, a diplomatic source indicated. 
  The resolution's principles will not be applied to people 
with the right of asylum, refugees allowed to stay for 
humanitarian reasons, and asylum-seekers. They can be made more 
flexible on the basis of bilateral agreements between members 
states and certain third countries. 
  The delicate question of workers with a work permit in one 
EU 
member state wishing to work in another EU member state was left 
for a later resolution.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes by Marc </F>
Reynebeau and Hubert Van Humbeecks; place and date not given: 
"A Little Moderation, Please"] 
  [Text] [KNACK] The European Union (EU) has been worrying 
for a long time now whether it should first concentrate on 
enlargement or greater integration. The decision now seems to 
have been made for the former. Are you happy with that? Was 
not Belgium in fact inclined to give priority to integration? 
  [Claes] No, we are certainly not happy with that. But the 
circumstances dictated otherwise. Under pressure from the large 
member states, we have accepted a compromise, with enlargement 
limited to four countries: Austria, Norway, Sweden, and 
Finland, countries which have much to offer both in 
monetary-economic terms and politically. The number one 
priority of the European enterprise, stability on the European 
Continent, is being increasingly jeopardized by developments in 
Central and East Europe. We cannot remain an island of 
stability. But that must not rule out a deeper Europe: 
Otherwise the European enterprise threatens to be diluted into 
nothing more than a large economic area. The major, initial 
ambition was for Europe to become a political entity for 
everyone. 
  The 1996 intergovernmental conference is of historic 
importance in this sense. It was still possible in Maastricht 
to cover up the fundamental contradictions with shaky 
compromises. That will no longer be possible in 1996. That 
could result in a two-speed Europe, within which, in addition to 
enlargement, a small group of countries opt for faster 
integration. The other member states would then have to settle 
for an economic area for the time being. 
  [KNACK] That is also the idea recently expressed by Mr. 
Lamassoure, your French colleague for European affairs, in LE 
MONDE. 
  [Claes] Yes, but he gives the impression that we were all 
invited to come together to pledge support for the Bonn-Paris 
alliance. I would like to say a few words about that, because 
that does not serve the interests of more democracy in the Union. 
  [KNACK] Is the danger of this Bonn-Paris alliance not that 
it 
could prompt other alliances in response? 
  [Claes] It is only logical for alliances to result in the 
formation of counteralliances. And that is not in line with our 
concept of a Europe in which smaller countries have their proper 
say and in which minorities are happy to go along with the view 
of the majority. Whether they originate in Bonn and Paris or 
London and Rome, these bilateral initiatives do nothing to 
promote EU credibility. 
  [KNACK] How should we envisage a two-speed Europe? 
  [Claes] The economic area which we now have is a sound 
basis. 
I genuinely believe that a couple of member states can fulfill a 
pioneering role. Provided that the door remains open to other 
countries to join them when they have met the conditions. Such 
a construction was already envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty: 
Monetary Union is also to be achieved in stages. It could 
result in a structure with two levels of decisionmaking, 
depending on the competences. At the second level, only those 
included would decide. Can you tell me how the present 
institutional system can work if tomorrow we find ourselves with 
20 or more members? How are the wheels going to turn? I do not 
believe there is any alternative. 
  [KNACK] European Commission President Delors will be 
outlining his white paper at the Corfu summit at the end of this 
month. How can he develop a coherent employment policy if the 
EU is unable to pursue a common fiscal and social policy, with 
the fraud and social dumping which results? That can jeopardize 
everything decided at Corfu. 
  [Claes] Most certainly. I will again be accused of looking 
with regret to the past, but that is not true; I have no problem 
with a market economy, provided there is sufficient control. 
The market economy always neglects the long term; the focus is 
more on profit than on people. I believe that any social or 
economic policy should focus on people. 
  The Union is very ambitious in terms of economic 
integration, 
it even accepts that it cannot be achieved without sufficient 
economic convergence, without a sufficiently concerted economic 
policy. But the EU has too few resources to develop a 
voluntarist policy as proposed by Delors. But that is what we 
need. The latest most striking example is the failure of the 
Commission in the steel sector. Commissioner Karel van Miert's 
plans failed, because not enough players wanted to participate. 
How is any coordinated cross-border policy possible in such 
circumstances? 
  If it can't succeed in the case of steel, what chance of 
success is there for modern technologies? These are going to 
help determine the shape of society and no doubt open up 
ideological debates. Delors is not exaggerating when he compares 
in his white paper the development of modern technologies, the 
combination of the written and spoken word and the image, with 
the first industrial revolution. The increasingly concrete 
applications of these technologies are creating new services as 
well as changing the way of life of people in the West. We 
cannot just leave all this to forces governed solely by the 
short-term profit motive, and which are thus much less 
interested in the very important side effects of this new 
industrial revolution. A sound democratic institution such as 
the EU must give direction to these forces. 
  [KNACK] Are you thinking of the success of Silvio Berlusconi 
in Italy? 
  [Claes] I didn't need to wait for Berlusconi to come along 
to 
feel concern about what happens when the same people who decide 
what information is to be circulated and what is not are also 
responsible for deciding policy. That is a worrying development. 
  [KNACK] So you want to update [French philosopher] 
Montesquieu and include the media as the fourth power in a 
system of separation of powers? 
  [Claes] It is a long time since we have seen a proper 
balance 
in the functioning of the three perfectly separated powers, as I 
am sure everyone will agree. Nothing is eternal, and perhaps 
Montesquieu does need a little revision. 
  The Chinese also used to have a fourth power, the 
administration. In our case it is the media. 
  [KNACK] The press as the fourth power, you are not having a 
dig are you? 
  [Claes] No, but another question is whether what is 
happening 
now is good for the necessary independence of the individual 
journalist. 
  [KNACK] The failure of the common foreign policy in the 
former Yugoslavia has not much for the EU's credibility. 
  [Claes] Foreign policy must also be debated in 1996. The 
problem is that a consensus must first always be obtained. The 
second cornerstone of the Maastricht Treaty is the need for an 
approach based on an intergovernmental philosophy. One article 
in the Treaty also says, however, that a decision by a qualified 
majority can be implemented, there is just a reluctance to apply 
this in practice. 
  This does not alter the fact that under the Belgian 
presidency, a number of joint actions were established, such as 
in the Middle East, the former Yugoslavia, and South Africa. 
That was not bad, but it was not enough. There is then the 
question: Who is going to pay? As it is a common policy, there 
must not be any doubts on this point, but this decision has not 
yet been taken. You are therefore developing a policy without 
knowing how you are going to pay for it. But we should also 
remember that Maastricht has only been in force for seven 
months. It is not therefore so surprising to find that national 
policies are being pursued which are contradictory to the EU 
directives. This should progressively improve. 
  [KNACK] But there is the feeling that EU diplomacy is not 
taken seriously at the international level? 
  [Claes] In the conflict in Yugoslavia, there was clearly 
going to be an attempt to achieve a common position under the 
United Nations'supervision. Talks then developed with 
Washington and Moscow, to which London and Paris were invited as 
members of the UN Security Council. The EU as such was not 
present, was not even invited. 
  Europe is not therefore a player on the world stage. For the 
large member states, their membership of the Security Council 
remains much more important than the EU as such. The Yugoslav 
experience taught us that. 
  [KNACK] How difficult is foreign policy for a small 
country? Belgium's actions in Zaire, Rwanda, and Burundi have 
not been outright successes. 
  [Claes] It would be pretty stupid to claim the opposite was 
true. However, objectively speaking, it must be said that the 
entire continent of Africa is a mess. In a recent report, the 
United Nations also came to the conclusion that it is necessary 
to move away from the policies being followed, not just for 
countries that have bilateral relations with that continent, but 
also multilateral relations, via major organizations. 
  Since the early 1970's, Africa has steadily moved backward 
despite the impressive sums given it by the international 
community. Politically, too, there is no glimpse of success. 
The requirement of democratizing authoritarian regimes has not 
yielded much, with the exception of South Africa. 
  So should we turn our backs on Africa? No. In humanitarian 
terms, it is inexcusable to leave hundreds of millions of people 
to their fate. Nor would that be a good thing politically. 
Africa's instability can cause serious disturbances on other 
continents. 
  Of course, I do not have a miracle solution, but I do still 
believe in the need for a cautious democratization policy which 
puts the emphasis squarely on the respect of human rights. It 
would also be sensible to give policies a more regional flavor. 
We will have to work in larger units, since bilateral 
approaches have had too little success. 
  [KNACK] What does that mean for Belgium in concrete terms? 
  [Claes] It is not because the democratization process in the 
three countries where we are very active has failed that we have 
to reconcile ourselves to the preexistence of these corrupt and 
authoritarian regimes. I am totally opposed to that. However, 
Belgium cannot take up the challenge alone. Reconstructing even 
small countries such as Rwanda or Burundi using Belgian 
resources alone is impossible. We can indeed play a pioneering 
role, and play the role of advocate for these countries 
vis-a-vis the IMF, the World Bank, and major donors. 
  Moreover, I would like to raise the issue of the share of 
blame which lies on the Africans themselves for this mess. At 
the end of the day, they are the ones primarily responsible, and 
in most cases they have not been paragons of ethics, democracy, 
or efficiency. One cannot say that Africa does not have an 
intellectual potential on which to draw. However, I cannot 
really appreciate the fact that perhaps the majority of African 
intellectuals trained in our universities opt to stay with us. 
They must go back and assume their responsibilities. There 
must be something other than the policy of the outstretched hand. 
  [KNACK] From the African side we hear the criticism that we 
must not impose our values and institutions. Do you stick by 
the universality of human rights. 
  [Claes] Yes. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is 
part of the foundation of the UN Charter. The next century will 
be more international than ever, so there must be some basic 
rules, and these include universal human rights. I would like 
to draw some distinctions as far as political systems are 
concerned, certainly over time. I want to gain an understanding 
of the problems facing political leaders in countries which 
sometimes have hundreds of millions of inhabitants. The 
situation cannot be turned around just like that. This calls 
for pragmatic views, which must not lead us away from the final 
goal. 
  [KNACK] They will tell you that it is easy for you to talk: 
Human rights were invented by the West. Some Asian countries 
assert other values, and put a fundamentally different emphasis 
on things. 
  [Claes] It is generally the leadership groups in those 
countries that do that. Massive proletariats are being created 
in those countries, as was the case with us earlier. In the 
medium term they will come to the conclusion which led to 
emancipation in the West. So we are on the edge of a profound 
movement. This does not mean that I have no eye for other 
values or standards. For this reason I am not inclined to make 
many concessions in the area of human rights. 
  [KNACK] In recent years, it has been hypothesized that the 
conflicts of the future will be conflicts between large 
cultures, for example between the West and the Islamic world. 
  [Claes] I do not believe in such a conflict. Mohammed's 
teachings do not impose intolerance or blind hatred. However, 
in the past we too have had to deal with religious radicals. 
Moreover, fundamentalism is supported not just by religious 
fanaticism, but also by social and economic abuses. How can we 
fight that? Not by getting mixed up in discussions about the 
interpretation of a belief, but by assuming our social and 
economic responsibilities. The European troika was in Algiers 
recently. We had to help those people there who view universal 
human rights as an end goal. They are working to form a system 
of democratic pluralism. We must help them improve the social 
and economic situation of the people. 
  [KNACK] But the IMF has just imposed very tough conditions 
on 
Algeria which will surely not improve the lives of people in 
that country. This is happening in many Third World countries. 
Are we not part of the IMF? 
  [Claes] It is correct that the IMF has often imposed reforms 
that resulted in young democracies suffering heavily, or which 
dramatically worsened social situation. That is an old 
complaint. I think that in the meantime there has been a 
strategic move away from this approach. 
  In Algeria, the IMF action was inevitable for monetary 
reasons. The question now is whether the West is prepared to 
minimize the rough edges of this operation. In any case, a 
major debt rescheduling program has been arranged. I believe 
that a consensus has formed within the IMF for a more friendly 
policy vis-a-vis the Mediterranean area, especially the Maghreb. 
  [KNACK] In a recent speech you warned against the legacy of 
Byzantium. Did that speech not emphasize the clash of cultures? 
  [Claes] I simply wanted to say that it would be naive to try 
and explain everything from a Western viewpoint. In countries 
where the Byzantine civilization made its influence felt for 
centuries, this is reflected in structures which differ clearly 
from those of the West. This has little to do with the traces 
of 70 years of communism, because before then the Byzantine 
civilization had already put the emphasis on other areas. 
  It is not that I want to be proven right, but you cannot 
ignore the warning of Czech President Vaclav Havel, when he 
expressed his fear about populist reactions to the social 
disappointments in the economic reform process. I still believe 
that blindly moving to a market system must lead to unacceptable 
social wrongs, which then play into the hands of 
populist-reactionary politicians. The reform of the economic 
system was and is necessary. However, this must be done 
gradually. I have never believed in the so-called economic 
blitz strategies. I can remember the great Russian professor 
who came to my office to explain that he had a plan for 
reforming his country's economy in 500 days. I told him: "With 
all due respect, professor, you are forgetting that you are 
working with people." 
  The postcommunist election successes in Lithuania, Poland, 
and Hungary are undoubtedly a signal sent by a large proportion 
of the population that they expect more attention to be paid by 
their politicians to the social interests of the people. 
Central Europe does not want to have anything to do with brute 
liberalism, in which a small stratum of people will become 
scandalously rich while the rest sink into unemployment without 
any coverage for the major social risks. 
  [KNACK] Yes, and what about Russia? 
  [Claes] Russia presents the picture of a humiliated 
superpower which does not intend to be left alone. The economy 
has deteriorated, and is largely controlled by a new type of 
mafiosi. There have been elections and there is a constitution. 
That is good, but the text might as well have been written 
especially for Boris Yeltsin. I try to imagine what would 
happen tomorrow if Aleksandr Rutskoy or Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
were to become president. It is not encouraging. Washington is 
flooding us with optimistic analyses of the situation in Moscow 
which I have never shared. I am not saying that Russia no 
longer has a chance to consolidate its democracy or to modernize 
its economy, but what we know about it today does not lead to 
optimism. 
  I am primarily concerned about Ukraine. It is a large, 
strategically located country which has nuclear weapons. The EU 
offered it a partnership as a way of giving it some basis for 
gaining control of its social and economic shambles and to give 
a boost to its democratic forces. Ukraine is not really making 
any progress with denuclearization and is torn between an 
eastern part that wants to join Russia and a western part that 
does not want to belong to Russia. There is also the quarrel 
about how to divide up the Black Sea Fleet and about control 
over the Crimea. There is plenty of instability, and that can 
make the much faster integration of a number of Central European 
countries into our institutions inevitable. I hope it will not 
lead to this scenario, but all the signals I receive every day 
just push me toward certain intellectual exercises. 
  [KNACK] Could not our institutions have prevented things 
from taking this course? 
  [Claes] I think that NATO and the Western European Union, on 
the one hand, and the EU, on the other, could not have done any 
more than they have done so far. What else could NATO have done 
besides the cooperation involved in the Partnership for Peace? 
The alternative was to offer some Central European countries 
full membership, thus drawing a new East-West border on the map 
of Europe. That would clearly have been a negative sign for 
those countries which did not qualify. In actual fact, they 
would have been pushed back into the Russian sphere of 
influence. However, that does not mean that we must avoid a 
dialogue with Moscow. With that kind of military superpower it 
must be possible to make specific arrangements. The EU also 
followed the only possible strategy: association agreements 
with potential members, aid programs, and political dialogue. 
These actions have prospects. Immediate accession was not an 
option: That would have loosened European cohesion and would 
not have done those countries a favor. Their economies are not 
strong enough to follow the pace set by European policies. 
  We have made it clear to those countries which are not 
called 
upon to become members that we would go as far as possible with 
them. This means partnership agreements, which involve 
far-reaching cooperation in a wide variety of areas. Surely, 
all this represents a responsible and homogeneous approach? 
There is no other conceivable strategy at present, unless, I 
repeat, unforeseen events rule out that scenario. 
  [KNACK] Is it correct to assert that the West has expanded 
its institutions eastward, but that it is letting Russia keep 
its "nearby foreign countries": i.e., the republics of the 
former Soviet Union, with the exception of the Baltic states? 
  [Claes] No. We also offered partnership agreements to the 
other republics of the former Soviet Union. 
  [KNACK] Not a whole lot of work was put into that. 
  [Claes] No, but they did not apply either. Moreover, you 
have to draw a line somewhere. I do not agree with Russia's 
definition of "nearby foreign countries." That seems to clash 
with our concept of the independence and territorial integrity 
of countries recognized by the international community. Of 
course, there is the problem of the tens of millions of Russians 
who live in other republics. They have to apply for a minority 
status. However, Moscow feels that that is no reason to take 
military action on the territory of other countries, unless they 
asked for it themselves. 
  [KNACK] Has Russia already taken action in Georgia? 
  [Claes] That is a delicate question. To what extent can 
these kinds of operations take place, whether or not behind the 
screen of the CSCE? Only if the CSCE procedures are respected. 
However, if the CSCE acknowledges that there is reason for an 
intervention, then those people, who today criticize Moscow, 
must dare to admit that no single European country can give or 
wants to give the CSCE the resources it needs to play its role. 
We said quite clearly to [Russian Foreign Minister] Andrey 
Kozyrev: "A little moderation please." If he asks whether we 
are prepared to send troops or provide financial support, 
nothing will come of it. We have to tell things like they are.

<F P=106> ["fel"-attributed report: "Intelligence Service Officials </F>
to the Drug Front"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- This week Italy's and France's security 
organs managed to deal two blows to organized crime. In 
Lombardy, more than 200 suspected Mafiosi were arrested, who are 
accused of hundreds of crimes -- from drug trafficking to 
murder. Among the more than two dozen drug dealers who were 
arrested in Toulon and the surroundings, there are also the two 
killers of Yann Pait, a parliamentary deputy and dedicated 
fighter against organized crime, who was shot dead in Hyeres in 
February. 
  Reportedly, intelligence service experts were involved in 
the 
investigations preceding the two large-scale police operations. 
If this is true, Italians and French did what FRG Interior 
Minister Kanther wants to make possible in Germany and which has 
been repeatedly been demanded by Interpol Secretary General 
Raymond Kendall over the past weeks. 
  The British criminologist, who was responsible for antidrug 
operations at Scotland Yard for several years, recently said 
that one may assume that drugs constitute a threat that is 
similar to a war. Thus, appropriate means must be mobilized, 
starting with the intelligence services and counterespionage. 
With their technical knowledge, these authorities could "be 
extremely useful in the struggle against organized crime." 
  The criminal opponents at the drug front have long been 
using 
intelligence service means. Given estimated annual profits of 
$300 billion, they have the financial means to undermine the 
bases of the democratic states. Consequently, Rendall and other 
advocates of stricter drug repression accept rule-of-law 
objections against the mixing of the assignments of intelligence 
services and police only to a certain extent. The Interpol 
chief thinks that the resulting risks are "far smaller than the 
dangers posed by organized crime." Kanther, too, wants the 6,000 
officials of the Federal Intelligence Office (BND) to "put their 
technical possibilities into the service of discovering crimes." 
For this purpose, he must amend the BND law. Whether the 
Bundestag will agree is just as questionable as the readiness of 
the intelligence service officials to subject themselves to 
stricter political control.

  [Text] Paris, June 22 (AFP) -- Singapore Airlines ordered 
10 more A340-300 long-range Airbus planes and took out options 
for another 20 on Wednesday [22 June], the European consortium 
Airbus Industrie announced. 
  The total order for the 30 planes would be worth 5.4 billion 
dollars. 
  The airline, which already ordered seven A340's in December 
1992, will thus become Airbus Industrie's biggest customer with 
37 of this very long-range model. 
  The planes ordered Wednesday will be delivered starting in 
spring 1996.

Austrian Petroleum Corporation (OeMV) in Abu Dhabi at the 
weekend. IPIC has bought 19.56 percent of the basic capital of

  Beyond specific cooperation, Austria is viewed as an "ideal 
partner state in Europe" by the United Arab Emirates, the 
transportation minister told APA after his brief visit to Abu 
Dhabi. Sales cooperation thus applies to Central Europe as a 
whole. However, OeMV will continue to operate independently. 
  Also, there is "neither an obligation nor the intention" on 
the part of the Arab partner to introduce its own gasoline brand 
into Central Europe. Klima also ruled out splitting the 
department responsible for natural gas deals from the concern.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Grolig and Gerald Reischl: "The Red </F>
Godfathers Are Reaching Out to the West"] 
  [Excerpts] He called himself Yuriy Chekin a.k.a. Marek 
Lipskiy a.k.a Dmitriy Beretsine and lived in Vienna's 
Erdbergstrasse -- as did his five Russian compatriots, who used 
a total of 11 different names. Just when they came to Austria 
is unclear. In April 1994 they were arrested during an 
attempted break-in. When their apartment was searched, police 
found a heap of passports and 260,000 tear-gas sprays. The 
officials saw this as an indication that the eastern mafia is 
behind this gang. The leaders are unknown. 
  The lawyer was paid by "friends" -- business partners and 
relatives, who have been in Austria for some time. "The 
background is unclear," says a Viennese lawyer who wants to 
remain anonymous. "I must remain anonymous out of caution. One 
never knows who might be behind them." In 1993 he involuntarily 
became an expert on the "Russian mafia." "A CIS citizen 
recommended me when he was in detention awaiting trial. Now I 
get many such cases." Over the past months he has had 10 of 
them. Have they been won? "So far I have not had a trial." 
  Austria has become the hub of the eastern mafia: Drug 
dealers from Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, car thieves from Poland 
and Ukraine, blackmailers --demanding protection money--from 
Moscow and Turkey, and money launderers from China. In 1993 
125,000 crimes were credited to criminals from mafia circles. 
The Interior Ministry avoids the term mafia and speaks of 
"organized crime." 
  "We do not have any concrete figures," Michael Sika, 
director 
general of public security, admits. "We assume that the 
proportion of organized crime is 25 to 30 percent of all 
crimes." Three years ago estimates were at 20 percent. 
According to forecasts by experts, by the end of the century one 
out of two crimes will be committed by a gang member. The 
majority are car thefts. In 1993, 2,998 cars were stolen. Most 
of them disappear to East Europe. 
  The mafia is marching toward Austria -- above all from the 
former USSR. Freedom of travel has opened up previously 
unimaginable opportunities. In the former Soviet Union there 
are 5,000 gangs with a total of about 3 million members. In 
1991 alone 225,000 state employees were sentenced for 
embezzlement there. A total of 20,000 policemen were proved to 
be cooperating with the mafia -- the mafia which is now reaching 
out toward the West. 
  The Austrian Embassy in Moscow approves 400 to 500 
applications for visas per day. "Two-thirds are businessmen," 
Consul Vjekoslav Freisitzer says. In order to be permitted to 
travel to Austria, one needs the invitation of a company 
operating in Austria. "These are often invitations issued as a 
favor. In the case of many companies one does not know who is 
behind them," Freisitzer says. There are strict checks. 
Between 10 and 30 CIS citizens per month are found to have 
forged invitations. 
  By the end of May 1994 the Interior Ministry had issued 
1,008 
work permits for CIS citizens; in total, about 7,500 people from 
the former USSR currently live in Austria. "So far this year, 
2,000 residence permits have been issued," Peter Wiedermann, 
head of the immigration police, says. However, there are hardly 
any problems with CIS citizens. Only 59 have applied for asylum 
this year. 
  Nevertheless, Michael Sika assumes that eight to 10 
companies 
per month are founded under the patronage of the "red 
godfathers" in Austria. Rumors that the Naschmarkt [large, 
open-air market in Vienna] in Vienna is also controlled by the 
Russian mafia have not been confirmed. Last year the profile of 
its stand owners was studied: The 167 stands belong to 
Russians, Turks, and Kurds, some of whom have been nationalized. 
They could be blackmailed by former compatriots. 
  The Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] in 
Wiesbaden has studied organized crime in East Europe. Since 1 
September 1991 a project has been under way to evaluate all 
information about groups of criminals from the former USSR. 
"Four gangs are active in Germany," BKA spokesman Thomas 
Rindsfuesser says. In Austria the situation is similar, he 
notes. 
  The first group, the exile Russians, are active in the 
sphere 
of economic crime. "Enormous amounts of goods are transferred 
via joint ventures, some of them illegally," Rindsfuesser says. 
"Thus, new routes for the delivery of drugs have also been 
developed." However, exile Russians are also often victims of 
blackmail. 
  The second group are criminals from the former autonomous 
Chechen-Ingush republic, hierarchically organized gangs. 
Rindsfuesser: "A council of elders, which consists of the gang 
leaders, divides the areas and makes sure that conflicts among 
groups are avoided." The Chechens' main source of revenues is 
protection money. 
  The Dolgoprudnenskaya come from the boxing world. "This gang 
could organize the red-light scene in the future," Rindsfuesser 
says. 
  These mafiosi, who offer protection to the expatriate 
Russians, come from Georgia. 
  [passage omitted] "Austria is used by the Russian mafia for 
financial operations. It is also used by the Georgians, and by 
the Chechens. So far, there have been no excesses and 
attempts to take over by force, as there have been in Budapest, 
Prague, and Berlin," Josef Dick, an Interior Ministry official, 
stresses. Austria is the starting point for financial 
transactions and large-scale property crimes. 
  On the occasion of a meeting in Vienna, the United States 
estimates the global turnover of illegal financial operationa at 
$1 billion per day. The majority of the money comes from the 
former USSR. "An unimaginable hotbed of crisis," says Walter 
Pretzner, head of the "Task Force for Combating Organized Crime" 
(EDOK) in the Interior Ministry. The madness: Billions are 
taken out of the country by the "red godfathers" and invested in 
West European industries. At the same time, Western countries 
are spending large amounts on aid for the East. After all, the 
hotbed of unrest is nuclear power. At the moment, the security 
authorities cannot yet reach those who are benefiting from this. 
However: "The time will come," the EDOK head says with 
optimism. "We are only just beginning our counterstrategies." 
There are already special antimafia groups in the eight 
criminal departments of the provincial police. Soon special 
units are to be established also in all 14 federal police 
directorates -- a total of 23 such units. 
  There hass already been some success: This year the EDOK 
registration office, to which monetary transactions involving 
more than 200,000 schillings must be reported, has already 
examined 149 cases in which money laundering was suspected. A 
total of 215 million schillings were "frozen" at the order of 
the judiciary.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi and the delegation 
accompanying him arrived in Brussels today. Soon after his 
arrival, he held preliminary talks with Belgian officials and 
representatives of our community there. Over to Rachida Hamadi 
from Brussels: 
  [Hamadi] Indeed. Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi and the 
delegation accompanying him are now continuing their meeting 
with our community in Belgium at the Algerian embassy. Mr. 
Mokdad Sifi arrived in Belgium at noon today. He met Arab 
ambassadors and held his expected meeting with Belgian Prime 
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. The meeting lasted over one hour. 
Mr. Dehaene is tipped as the candidate to succeed Jacques 
Delors as president of the European Commission. 
  [Begin Dehaene recording in French with superimposed Arabic 
translation] Relations between Belgium and Algeria have always 
been good; there have been constant commercial and economic 
links. This meeting falls within the framework of efforts aimed 
at strengthening these relations. [end recording] 
  [Hamadi] The purpose of this European tour, which comes on 
the eve of the European summit in Corfu and less than one month 
before the G-7 summit in Naples, is to bolster European-Algerian 
cooperation in various fields, particularly after the agreement 
with the IMF and the Paris Club. Observers here point out that 
Algeria has invigorated the political and economic reforms by 
establishing the Transitional National Council and the National 
Economic and Social Council, and has opened the first door to a 
market economy. They add that all these facts will give Algeria 
a winning card in its international economic dealings. 
  [Begin Sifi recording] The visit has several objectives. We 
will be disseminating information that will enable us to explain 
the Algerian Government's efforts in the political and economic 
fields. This visit is also aimed at developing and bolstering 
support in the political and economic fields. [end recording] 
[passage omitted] 
  The prime minister will leave Belgium tomorrow for Paris on 
a 
similar mission.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Veestraeten: "Government Majority Backs </F>
Dehaene, Plus Sections of Opposition"] 
  [Text] It goes without saying that the CVP 
[Flemish-speaking Christian People's Party] supports the 
candidacy of Jean-Luc Dehaene for the presidency of the European 
Commission (EC). The CVP has always said that it would consider 
it a great honor for a Flemish Christian Democrat to be asked to 
head the EC. It is said in CVP circles that if the CVP had done 
badly in the elections, it would have asked Dehaene to continue 
to serve as Belgian prime minister. When it became clear that 
the result was much better than hoped, the need to keep Dehaene 
in place was no longer felt. But how do the other Flemish 
parties react to Dehaene's candidacy? 
<H5>  Flemish-speaking Socialist Party: Continue </H5>
  "The Flemish-speaking Socialist Party (SP) considers it an 
honor for the country," SP Chairman Frank Vandenbroucke says, 
"that Dehaene has been asked to head the EC." This is no doubt 
due to the successful Belgian presidency of the EC during which 
Dehaene and Willy Claes jointly managed to settle a number of 
thorny issues. 
  On the other hand, the SP believes that the government must 
continue as it considers that the present team still has a great 
deal to do. The government must be able to reap the rewards of 
the difficult work it has undertaken in the last two years. One 
remaining problem is law and order. [Interior] Minister Tobback 
has given great encouragement in this area, partly through the 
additional 2,500 policemen to be recruited this year. 
<H5>  Flemish Liberal Party Backs Dehaene </H5>
  "The Flemish Liberal Party (VLD) has always said that it 
backed Dehaene's EC candidacy," says Patrick Dewael, VLD leader 
in the Chamber. He admits that this support has included a 
"slight oppositional undertone." "But if Belgium has a chance 
of winning Europe's top job, then we in the opposition are 
certainly going to back it," Dewael says. "We therefore fully 
support Dehaene's candidacy, without any ulterior political 
motives." 
  The VLD does take issue, however, with the undemocratic 
manner in which the EC president is appointed. It is in fact 
all down to lobbying activity, the individual citizen being 
totally excluded from the process. But it is accepted that 
Dehaene does not personally bear any blame for this, as the 
president is appointed by an established procedure. "If under 
this procedure it seems that Dehaene has the best chances then 
the government majority and the coalition must support it," 
Dewael says. 
<H5>  Live Differently: No Support </H5>
  Live Differently is unable to support Dehaene's candidacy as 
EC president. Dehaene's vision of Europe is not at all to Live 
Differently's liking. The most that can be expected of Dehaene 
is that he will try to make Europe somewhat less undemocratic 
and asocial. 
  Live Differently suspects that the other possible presidents 
would offer even fewer guarantees of the kind of developments 
the Greens would like to see. "But," Johan Malcorps states, 
"Live Differently refuses to accept this fundamental absence of 
any real alternative." 
<H5>  Flemish Bloc: Elections </H5>
  The fact that a governing prime minister is ready to move to 
the EU at a difficult time for the coalition parties, leads us 
to conclude that he no longer sees his task as the leader of a 
government that is barely holding together. Such is the opinion 
of Roeland Raes, Flemish Bloc's (VB) vice chairman. 
  Raes says that "the VB does not begrudge Dehaene his 
European 
post, but believes that Prime Minister Dehaene and his 
government team should draw the necessary conclusions from this 
departure, namely that this government has outlived its 
usefulness and should consult the voters, as soon as possible 
and no later than the year end, so that they can give their 
verdict on the government record to date." 
<H5>  The People's Union: Program </H5>
  The People's Union (VU) says that it is not the candidate 
president as an individual which is important but the program he 
will put forward. In the policy program, Dehaene must draw 
attention to, among other things, the equality of all languages 
and cultures, and respect for the identity of each community of 
peoples. The position of the Dutch language must be protected. 
The VU hopes that Dehaene will display more Flemish 
determination in this than in the matter of the European Trade 
Marks Office. Also important are the social dimension, 
democratization, and advocating the right to exist of 
communities and regions.

  [Text] The Dutch Defense Minister Relus ter Beek has said 
he wants the UN Security Council decision to send a 5,500 strong 
force of African troops to Rwanda to be given preference over 
the French plan to send its own force to the African country. 
Mr. ter Beek's statement follows talks between him and the UN 
Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus Ghali in New York. Mr. ter 
Beek said he was not opposed to the French plan, but he 
preferred the option of a UN force because of the credibility 
the UN has. The UN Security Council has just been meeting to 
discuss the French plan to send a military force to Rwanda, but 
no decision is expected until later today.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Growth of Organized Crime -- </F>
`Gangs Are Increasingly Settling Into the World of Ordinary 
Life,' CRI Says"] 
  [Text] Organized crime in the Netherlands is on the 
increase. Moreover, criminal groups are becoming more and more 
professional and are increasingly managing to settle into the 
world of ordinary life, claims the 1993 annual report by the 
Central Research Information division (CRI), which was published 
Wednesday [15 June]. 
  The CRI, which collects data on crime, confirms that in 
1993, 
there were 98 active criminal gangs that could be described as 
"highly organized." In 1991, there were 59, and when they were 
first inventoried in 1988 only three such groups were detected. 
  By organizing themselves in a more professional manner, 
these 
gangs are making increasingly large profits. For example, the 
CRI cites the ecstasy group that was broken up in 1992, which 
achieved an annual turnover of 300 million guilders [G], with a 
net result of G240 million. Only a few tens of millions could 
be traced. The rest has probably been invested in the world of 
ordinary life. 
  The CRI notes that the proceeds of crime are laundered on a 
large scale in the Netherlands. Already back in 1991, the 
Fiscal Information and Investigation Department calculated that 
G1 billion were being laundered every nine months, using 
exchange offices among other methods. According to the CRI, 
control of unusual money transfers has now been improved. 
  One growing new trend is for criminal groups to attempt to 
counter the work done by the police and justice authorities. 
The gangs observe police officers at work, eavesdrop on them, 
threaten senior officers in the course of investigations, and 
spread false reports aimed at portraying such officers in a 
damaging light. These defamation campaigns are causing the 
police and justice departments considerable nuisance because on 
each occasion an enquiry has to be made as to whether there can 
be talk of corruption. 
  Organized crime has a strongly international character. 
Criminal gains are channeled off to tax paradises where there 
is little monitoring of finances. Approximately 40 percent of 
the core members of highly organized gangs come from abroad. 
They mete out physical violence more often than criminal groups 
led by Netherlanders. In 1993, there were more than 100 fatal 
shootings, 23 of which were executions carried out among the 
criminal fraternity. 
  The annual report also provides data on specific offenses: 
Narcotic trafficking remains one of the most lucrative forms of 
organized crime. Several hundred criminal organizations are 
involved in such activities. According to the CRI, 85 percent 
of the heroin encountered in the Netherlands is brought in by 
Turkish gangs working the so-called Balkan route. Turkish 
coffee houses play a major role in such sales. 
  Smuggling cocaine to Europe is virtually entirely in the 
hands of organizations based in the Colombian town of Cali. In 
1993, more heroin and cocaine was intercepted than in 1992. In 
addition, a higher number of drug laboratories were closed down. 
However, the total amount of marijuana confiscated by the 
authorities decreased. 
  The number of attempted hold-ups increased from almost 2,300 
to approximately 2,700, but the number of successful hold-ups 
dropped. Financial institutions, hotels, and restaurants, and 
"other businesses" are the main targets of armed robbers. 
One-third of all hold-ups are committed within the area of 
jurisdiction of Amsterdam, which comprises the provinces of 
North Holland and Utrecht. 
  Relatively speaking, the number of hold-ups is increasing 
fastest (by 35 percent) in the police region of 
Rotterdam-Rijmond. For the fifth successive year, the 
percentage of solved hold-ups has decreased. The figure for 
1993 is 29 percent. 
  The number of car thefts has doubled in just 10 years. In 
1993, more than 33,000 motor vehicles were stolen. Cars 
manufactured by Opel are the favorite targets of car thieves, by 
a margin of almost 10,000 vehicles. Of all the vehicles stolen, 
59 percent are subsequently found, half of these within five 
days of being stolen. According to the CRI, this means that many 
thefts are instances of joyriding, i.e. "the fulfillment of a 
one-off need for a vehicle." 
  Finally, the annual report indicates that a higher number of 
financial and economic offenses are being committed. Since the 
Center for Reporting Unusual Transactions was set up two years 
ago, more than 5,000 suspicious financial transactions have been 
reported, worth a total of G2.4 billion. It emerged that in 
half of these cases, the persons involved already had a criminal 
record. A considerably higher number of forged banknotes were 
confiscated, the 100-guilder note being the forgers' favorite. 
  Thanks to better registration by three special police teams, 
a substantially higher number of instances of computer crime 
came to light. One new form of computer crime involves the 
misuse of international telecommunications facilities. For 
example, it was discovered that long-distance calls were being 
made at the local Netherlands tariff from the Netherlands via 
Denmark. The Danish telephone company concerned lost 
approximately G2.5 million as a result.

<F P=106> [By Peter Mulligan, PRESS ASSOCIATION News parliamentary </F>
staff] 
  [Text] The prime minister today moved to calm Tory 
backbench fears about further defence cuts, insisting he would 
do nothing to undermine the fighting effectiveness of the armed 
forces. 
  Mr Major was speaking at Commons question time after Andrew 
Robathan, Conservative MP for Blaby, said there was "very real 
concern" at the continuing reduction in Britain's defence 
capability. 
  A Whitehall leak earlier this week suggested the jobs of 
more 
than 20,000 servicemen were at risk under the Front Line First 
study, which aims to cut the defence budget by 2.3 billion 
pounds over the next three years. 
  Mr Major declared: "The Front Line First programme will do 
nothing to reduce the fighting effectiveness of our armed forces 
and our ability to undertake defence commitments." 
  He told Mr Robathan: "I can reassure you that our commitment 
to effective front line forces remains undiminished. The Front 
Line First study is designed to make sure that money spent on 
defence administration and support is kept to a minimum. That is 
a sensible aim." 
  Mr Robathan told the prime minister: "There is very real 
concern around the country about the continuing reduction in our 
defence capability, as illustrated yesterday by the leak about 
the defence costs study." 
  To loud Tory cheers, he asked: "Can you reassure your 
friends 
on this side of the House that you will never allow the growth 
of expenditure on social security to undermine our national 
security?" 
  Tory Cyril Townsend, MP for Bexleyheath, told Mr Major that 
since earlier defence cuts were prepared, the "world has become 
more turbulent and less certain." 
  Calling for the current study to be reviewed, Mr Townsend 
said the French, who had roughly similar international defence 
commitments, had recently agreed to increase their defence 
budget. 
  The prime minister said of the French: "In cash, they spend 
broadly the same as we do, although they have a conscript army 
in France as compared to the professional army we have in the 
UK." 
  He went on: "Through the Front Line First defence costs 
study we aim to maximise the proportion of defence resources 
allocated to the front line. I believe that is the right way to 
determine our defence expenditure -- unlike Labour who scream 
`cuts' but would halve defence expenditure and,... if they had 
the opportunity, might also scrap our nuclear capacity."

<F P=106> [Philip Johnston report: "Internment an Option, Says </F>
Mayhew"] 
  [Text] Pressure on ministers to consider the introduction 
of selective internment in Northern Ireland was renewed 
yesterday following the Loughinisland pub massacre. 
  Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, said 
internment remained an option in the right circumstances and 
emergency powers were available if required. 
  "It isn't for nothing this Government insists on asking 
Parliament to renew annually the provision for internment," he 
said in Lisburn, Co Antrim. 
  "It has been retained because the Government believes that 
circumstances can be envisaged in which it would be necessary to 
use that power." 
  Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Tory Northern Ireland 
Committee, said now was the time for selective internment. 
  "When heightened terrorist activity is expected or taking 
place I believe that lifting 20 or 30 key people who are vital 
to the command structures of such organisations could make a 
major difference," he said. 
  "I know it is an abuse of civil liberties but it saves 
lives. 
The escalating sectarianism of the last few days is a classic 
example of a time to move in." 
  However, the calls were resisted by Mr Kevin McNamara, 
Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, who said such a move would 
"completely de-rail" the peace talks. 
  Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, urged that there should 
be no Republican retaliation for Saturday's murder of six 
Catholics watching football in O'Toole's bar in Loughinisland, 
Co Down. 
  He was quoted on BBC Radio as calling for "calm and 
restraint" in the face of a "premeditated attack aimed at 
deflecting those engaged in the peace process from that process." 
  Mr Adams also confirmed that Sinn Fein would give its 
long-awaited response to the Downing Street declaration within 
the next week or so. 
  "I hope the British Government has the political will to 
move 
this situation on, and so we can all move forward. Sinn Fein 
will not be found wanting," he said. 
  Sir Patrick's comments on internment were a well-used 
ministerial formula for dealing with the issue and did not 
appear to mark any new policy departure. 
  Powers to detain suspected terrorists without trial are 
available in the Emergency Provisions Act under which Northern 
Ireland is governed directly from London. 
  Internment powers were last used between 1971 and 1975, but 
the policy was too indiscriminate to be effective and the 
detention camps became rich recruiting grounds for the IRA. 
  Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister, has 
consistently rejected any question of internment in the 
Republic. Britain argues that without Irish assistance, 
terrorists would merely flee across the border and use the 
Republic as a safe haven.

<F P=106> [Article by Richard Meng: "Uranium Export to Russia </F>
Stopped"] 
  [Text] Wiesbaden, 20 Jun -- Siemens has temporarily 
stopped the export of uranium material from the fuel element 
factory in Hanau to Tomsk, Russia. On Monday [21 June] Siemens 
spokesman Rainer Jend confirmed that the company has declared 
its readiness to temporarily renounce any further transports 
until "uncertainties" of the German supervisory authorities have 
been clarified. Siemens has thus anticipated an order by Hesse 
Environment Minister Joschka Fischer (Greens), who intended to 
prohibit further deliveries to Tomsk effective immediately. 
  In May 1993, a contract was concluded with the Russian 
company, Tekhsnabexport, for the delivery of 140 tonnes of 
"slightly contaminated manufacturing remains" from the 
production of uranium-containing fuel elements in the factory in 
Hanau. In the past this "uranium scrap" was cleaned in Hanau 
itself. Since an explosion in late 1990, this has no longer 
been possible. The material, which has accumulated since then, 
was now supposed to be reprocessed in Tomsk. Jend said that the 
return to Germany of 70 tonnes of reusable enriched uranium 
hexafluoride as well as residue suitable for final storage was 
envisaged. 
  In five transports, 49 tonnes of uranium material has 
already 
been delivered to Russia with the permission of federal 
authorities. So far, the Hesse Environment Ministry had, in 
vain, demanded detailed information about whether the 
reprocessing in the facility in Tomsk, which is suffering from 
safety defects, according to German environmentalists, "is done 
without detrimental effect on the basis of German law." 
  A ban by Hesse (without immediate implementation) against 
the 
so far last transport on 30 May was nullified juridically by a 
complaint to the Administrative Court by Siemens. After Hesse 
had presented new arguments regarding the composition of the 
uranium material to Bonn, the Federal Environment Ministry for 
the first time permitted immediate implementation by Hesse in 
early June, if Siemens did not voluntarily renounce further 
transports for the time being.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Deputy Chairman Wolfgang Thierse by </F>
Horst Ohligschlaeger; place and date not given: "`A Lot 
Possible With the FDP'"] 
  [Text] [Ohligschlaeger] Some 160 billion German marks 
flow from west to east each year. Yet, at the recent local and 
European elections, between 20 and 40 percent of all east 
Germans voted for the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]. Do 
you understand this? 
  [Thierse] Beside the former supporters of the SED [Socialist 
Unity Party of Germany] regime, there seems to be a considerable 
number of Germans who think that they can best express their 
anger and frustration by handing it to the PDS. Helmut Kohl is 
to blame for this election result. Anyone promising as much as 
Kohl did in 1990, and delivering so little of it, should not be 
surprised to see an antiwestern party gain support in eastern 
Germany. 
  [Ohligschlaeger] But this development harms the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party] rather than the CDU [Christian Democratic 
Union]. 
  [Thierse] The CDU has clearly lost votes in eastern Germany, 
while the SPD has achieved considerable gains. But without the 
PDS, these gains could have been even higher. Secretly, the CDU 
is probably pleased at the PDS victory. But I do not think 
parties that promise a great deal, such as the CDU and the PDS, 
can be successful in the long run. 
  [Ohligschlaeger] Why has the SPD failed to win over the 
dissatisfied voters in eastern Germany? 
  [Thierse] The degree of frustration seems to call for a 
certain degree of radicalism. Unlike the PDS, the SPD cannot 
and will not promote antiwestern moods. We do not want an 
election campaign full of pessimism. We want to make offers 
that are feasible and can win a majority. 
  [Ohligschlaeger] But this does not seem to be very 
successful at the moment. 
  [Thierse] We have learned our lesson and we will conduct a 
far more emotional election campaign over the next few months. 
We must show that we are passionately committed to effecting a 
change of government. This also goes for myself. I have kept 
out of the debate on the European election campaign strategy 
because I did not feel competent enough on Europe. That is 
different in the Bundestag and landtag elections in eastern 
Germany. If I can contribute anything, it is certainly 40 years 
of GDR socialism. 
  [Ohligschlaeger] And what would you recommend on the subject 
of coalition statements? 
  [Thierse] We should not get tied up in coalition statements 
now. At the moment we are closer to the Greens programwise than 
we are to other parties. But what the talks in October will be 
like and what their outcome will be is still open. I think 
there is still a lot possible with the FDP [Free Democratic 
Party of Germany]. Everything will depend on the SPD's election 
results. And the results of the recent elections were not as bad 
as many people want to make believe: In the municipal 
elections, which are doubtless the more authentic ones, the SPD 
could gain up to 9 percent. 
  [Ohligschlaeger] Is this not making things look better than 
they are? In Saxony-Anhalt the CDU is ahead of the SPD by a 
small margin in spite of the wage scandal. 
  [Thierse] This is a false interpretation of the result. We 
have won up to 9 percent, and journalists call that defeat. The 
CDU has lost up to 8 percent in the east. But just because it 
has lost less than had been feared, a large crowd of journalists 
interprets this to be a victory for the CDU. 
  [Ohligschlaeger] So it is all the journalists' fault again? 
  [Thierse] I think that a large section of the media are CDU 
election campaign staff. They keep accusing the SPD of not 
making it clear enough what it plans to do after the elections. 
But the fact that the CDU has not yet presented a precise 
factual program does not seem to bother any of the journalists. 
The issue of parties' relations with the PDS is handled in a 
similar manner. 
  [Ohligschlaeger] Are you surprised about that? 
  [Thierse] Yes, because this problem is not peculiar to the 
SPD, but it is something that the CDU also has to face. 
  [Ohligschlaeger] What does the SPD say? 
  [Thierse] On the land and federal levels, any political 
cooperation between SPD and PDS must be ruled out, whether it is 
called coalition or something else. On the municipal level, 
there will not be any coalitions either; but there the situation 
is different. In Berlin, the district authorities' composition 
has been forced upon them by the election results. It is only 
decent democratic behavior to let people who have been elected 
cooperate in the solution of common problems, where this is 
necessary. The PDS has to be defeated by democratic decency 
instead of making it a martyr.

<F P=106> [Article by "deu/mes": "SPD Wants To Attack Chancellor Kohl </F>
More Severely; FDP Challenging the Greens"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Social Democratic Party [SPD] and the 
Free Democratic Party [FDP], losers of the European elections on 
12 June, want to improve their results in the October Bundestag 
elections by making their concepts more accentuated, and first 
of all they want to concentrate on the Saxony-Anhalt local 
elections next Sunday [26 June]. According to Federal Manager 
Guenter Verheugen, the SPD wants to make it clear at tomorrow's 
party conference in Halle that Germany will lose its prospects 
if it "continues the politics of the same old rut." According 
to FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer, the FDP's campaign will 
show voters that the issue to be voted on in autumn is "the 
parliamentary existence of political liberalism." 
  Verheugen said in Bonn that "more reasons are accumulating 
each day" for having a tough confrontation with Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In this context, the federal manager 
referred to the coalition's failed efforts to present a joint 
tax concept for the next four years. The state secretary in the 
Finance Ministry, Franz-Christoph Zeitler (Christian Social 
Union), said on the weekend that this failure is not due to 
differences between the Union and the FDP, but that it involves 
an opportunity to focus on different priorities in the election 
campaign. Verheugen said this means "simply that each of the 
government parties wants to serve their own customers in the 
election campaign." The slogan adopted by the Union and the FDP 
on tax issues is: "Lie separately, win jointly." But they will 
not succeed in this, Verheugen said. 
  The SPD's one-day party conference in Halle will adopt the 
government program and nominate Chairman Rudolf Scharping as 
candidate for chancellor. "Both these decisions will confirm 
that the SPD under Rudolf Scharping has achieved a high degree 
of unity," Verheugen announced. For the federal manager the 
lively internal debate on the SPD's election campaign strategy 
and coalition statements following the lost European elections 
is not surprising. In Verheugen's view, the large amount of good 
advice the SPD has received from party members is in line with 
the party leadership's basic course: "I cannot trace any 
tangible mood suggesting that a coalition statement must be made 
or that the strategy of concentrating on a few important issues 
must be changed." 
  Hermann Rappe, chairman of the Chemical Workers' Trade Union 
and SPD Bundestag deputy, warned the SPD against making a 
coalition statement in favor of the Greens. "Voters want to see 
unity in the SPD, and they want to see what the SPD's political 
priorities are," Rappe said on DEUTSCHLANDFUNK radio. 
Discussions about a coalition with the Greens are not right 
strategically, nor tactically, and they harm the party, Rappe 
said. 
  At its strategy debate on Saturday, there was wide agreement 
in the FDP Presidium that the party must deepen its election 
campaign in terms of contents. Besides achievement-orientation, 
the liberals' openness and their speaking out for tolerance and 
the constitutional state must be pointed out clearly, Secretary 
General Hoyer said. He was commissioned by the party to work 
out the "necessary corrections" to the existing advertising 
campaign and to present them to the Presidium within the next 
two weeks. It is obvious that the FDP must not concentrate 
solely on the economy, but must also "build a bridge" toward 
ecology; also it has to live up to its traditional role of 
"guardian" of the liberal constitutional state. 
  The FDP leadership also wants to conduct a more accentuated 
election campaign against the Greens. In a letter to leading 
party functionaries, Hoyer said that the Greens must no longer 
be spared on account of being "a party of kindly idealists." 
There are many overlaps between voters of the FDP and the 
Greens, which must be taken more into account in the future. 
The FDP does not want to "outdo the Greens in terms of green 
populism," but to step up involvement in issues "that are of 
utmost concern to the citizens." 
  Hoyer fiercely criticized Interior Minister Kanther's 
proposal to establish a voluntary reserve police force. Such a 
"spare-time police" is the wrong way to meet people's wish for 
more security. The state's division of powers must not be 
watered down. The right way, and the one that makes sense 
financially, is to increase the number of police officers, Hoyer 
said.

<F P=106> [DDP/ADN/ND report: "`Erlangen Model' Against Right-Wing </F>
Extremists"] 
  [Text] Erlangen -- Politicians from Erlangen, who run for 
the Bundestag, the Landtag, or the District Council, have 
rejected right-wing extremist organizations across all party 
lines. In the "Erlangen Model," which is to be copied 
elsewhere, 12 politicians from the Christian Social Union [CSU], 
Social Democratic Party [SPD], Free Democratic Party [FDP], and 
Alliance 90/Greens commit themselves not to participate in 
rallies to which members of the Republikaner, the National 
Democratic Party of Germany, the German People's Union, "or 
similar right-wing extremist organizations are invited as 
speakers or as participants in a discussion." 
  The declaration presented today is based on the "smallest 
common denominator," Hans-Hermann Hann of the "Alliance of 
Bavarian Town and City Councils Against Xenophobia and 
Right-Wing Extremism" stated. The alliance, which was founded 
in 1992, groups about 1,500 Bavarian town and city councils. 
The signatories certainly can have differing positions. Thus, 
the assessment of the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] is not 
unanimous. The CSU wanted to extend the declaration to the PDS 
and "other left-wing extremist organizations," but the other 
parties refused. The CSU signed the declaration nevertheless.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  Press Sees Win for Kohl in Partisan Process </H5>
  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] 
candidate Roman Herzog's win in Germany's 23 May presidential 
election was widely interpreted in that country's press as at 
least a short-term victory for CDU Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Most 
writers hesitated, however, to draw firm conclusions about the 
impact of the vote on the remainder of the 1994 political 
calendar, including the 16 October Bundestag election. Many 
commentators saw Free Democratic Party [FDP] Chairman Klaus 
Kinkel's decision to back Herzog rather than Social Democratic 
Party [SPD] candidate Johannes Rau in the election runoff as a 
crucial choice--one which, for better or worse, inextricably 
tied the FDP's political fate to that of its CDU/CSU coalition 
partners. Press examinations of the SPD's reaction to its loss 
focused on the public dissatisfaction of party Chairman Rudolf 
Scharping and other SPD leaders with the indirect electoral 
process, which allowed Herzog to become president despite an 
apparent popular preference for Rau. Commentators typically 
criticized the SPD's disgruntlement as politically ill-advised 
and stylistically distasteful. Those who also examined the 
merits of the SPD's arguments in favor of direct presidential 
elections generally opposed such a system as counter to the 
intent of the Basic Law, or constitution. Some, however, still 
worried that partisan politics had played too great a role in 
Herzog's election. 
<H5>  Kohl Seen Gaining in Short Term </H5>
  Reflecting mainstream press opinion on the election results, 
commentator Udo Bergdoll wrote in the 25 May SUEDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG that Helmut Kohl "is the big winner of 23 May." 
Bergdoll's conclusion was based on the fact that the election 
kept the (officially suprapartisan) presidency in CDU hands and 
gave Kohl a victory in Germany's last electoral contest before 
12 June -- the date for local votes in several laender and a 
nationwide poll for the European Parliament. Even commentaries 
critical of the electoral process and its outcome, like Werner 
A. Perger's front-page essay in the 27 May DIE ZEIT, conceded 
that Kohl had won the election because he had succeeded in 
defining it as a cold-blooded contest between "a change of power 
and retention of power." At least one writer went a step 
further, seeing Herzog's victory as an omen for future contests. 
Martin S. Lambeck, writing in the 24 May edition of DIE WELT, 
suggested that Herzog's election was the strongest sign yet of 
increasing popular support for the CDU. The victory, Lambeck 
argued, was a "political signal of important weight," and "an 
encouraging sign for a continuation of the [CDU/CSU-FDP] 
coalition beyond election day in October." Most writers, 
however, hesitated to draw many conclusions about the remainder 
of the political year from the results of the presidential race, 
and some actively disputed any such connection. Perger's DIE 
ZEIT commentary, for example, cautioned that the 12 June 
contests "follow other laws" and refused to accept Herzog's 
victory as a "preliminary decision for the Bundestag election." 
Bergdoll, too, warned in his 25 May SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG 
analysis that Kohl's short-term win could turn into a "Pyrrhic 
victory" if the FDP's strategy of loyalty to the coalition 
caused Kinkel's party to lose support in the fall, threatening 
the government's Bundestag majority. 
<H5>  FDP's Future Seen at Stake </H5>
  The wisdom of the FDP's decision to support its CDU/CSU 
coalition partners was the focus of much commentary, with most 
writers seeing it as a crucial choice which could make or break 
the party's future. In the 25 May edition of DIE WELT, 
Hans-Peter Schwarz described the decision of most FDP delegates 
to follow Kinkel and vote for Herzog over Rau as a "landmark 
decision on the course of [the party's] coalition policy." The 
FDP, which had traditionally drawn its voters from both the CDU 
and SPD camps, had now "defined itself by a strong majority as a 
party of the nonsocialist center, and thus against the SPD." 
While the FDP, for pragmatic reasons, might still decide on a 
coalition with the SPD after the Bundestag vote, the fate of 
Kinkel's party in the fall now depended on its ability to 
attract as much support as possible "from the reservoir of 
potential CDU/CSU voters." Bergdoll's commentary in the 25 May 
SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG went further, suggesting that the FDP had 
effectively abandoned its traditional position as holder of the 
balance of power between the two large parties. While this 
might seem like "liberation" in the short run, "the hangover 
will come later," Bergdoll warned, because some voters would 
interpret the party's choice as surrendering its separate 
identity to the CDU for the sake of a continued role in the 
government. Perger, in the 27 May DIE ZEIT, provided a hint of 
the potential backlash, denouncing the FDP as "obsessed with 
power" and available "to the highest bidder" and sarcastically 
praising Kinkel as a diligent student of Kohl's "brazenness." 
Claus Leggewie, writing in the 25 May DIE TAGESZEITUNG, struck a 
similar tone, arguing that the FDP had "once again proven its 
dispensability and opportunism" and even calling on those 
dissatisfied with the party's behavior to see to it that the 
"special-interest party FDP shrinks down to its puny stock of 
regular customers." 
<H5>  SPD Viewed as "Bad Loser" </H5>
  Most commentators who examined the SPD's public reaction to 
Herzog's win echoed Chancellor Kohl's description of the Social 
Democrats as "bad losers" for their postelection complaints. 
These writers typically pointed out that such behavior was poor 
form and bad--even dangerous--politics. Rudolf Augstein, in a 
30 May DER SPIEGEL commentary, called the SPD's attacks on the 
FDP for backing Herzog "useless and unjustified" and recalled 
that the CDU accepted a similar 1974 presidential loss more 
gracefully. Similarly, Peter Gillies, writing in DIE WELT of 25 
May, described the SPD's "gripes" as being "of depressing 
mediocrity," and Eckhard Fuhr, in the 26 May FRANKFURTER 
ALLGEMEINE, compared the party to a child who, having lost at a 
game, blames the rules. Pointing out that such conduct also has 
political consequences, Leggewie, in his 25 May DIE TAGESZEITUNG 
commentary, noted that Scharping "has yet again lost a few 
points" because of his "huffed" reaction to Herzog's win. In 
DIE WELT of 26 May, Ulrich Rosenbaum remarked that Scharping's 
attacks on the FDP, if overdone, could effectively eliminate any 
coalition options involving both parties. Since Scharping had 
already virtually ruled out a grand coalition with the CDU, 
Rosenbaum argued, the SPD leader would be forcing himself into 
a--politically very risky--coalition with the Greens. Looking 
beyond the immediate consequences for party politics, several 
writers warned that the SPD was undermining the legitimacy of 
the presidency and the Federal Republic itself by criticizing 
the result of a constitutional process as somehow undemocratic. 
Eckhard Fuhr's commentary in the 26 May FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, 
for example, accused the SPD of trying to make "political 
capital" at the expense of the Basic Law and federal 
institutions by implying that Rau had been cheated out of the 
presidency and by calling on voters to exact revenge in the 12 
June European Parliament vote. Several other writers also 
complained about this campaign strategy, which included a poster 
with the line, "You Will Decide This 
Election." Juergen Busche summed up press opinion on the SPD's 
tactics in the 24 May SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG when he wrote that 
"this is the way one stirs up public mistrust of the 
institutions of a democratic state." 
<H5>  Direct Election Rejected </H5>
  Most commentators also rejected SPD suggestions on their 
merits that direct election of the president might be preferable 
to the existing system, which entrusts the vote to a Federal 
Assembly reflecting the distribution of power in the Bundestag. 
Some writers simply expressed a desire to leave well enough 
alone and a fear of tinkering with tested institutions. 
Augstein, for example, wrote in his 30 May DER SPIEGEL 
commentary that the Basic Law "does not want a president who 
depends on the will of the people," and that the document "has 
proven its worth." Gillies, in his 25 May DIE WELT column, 
similarly maintained that "the fathers of the Basic Law based 
the election of the federal president on the principles of 
democracy, rather than those of public opinion polling, for good 
reason," though he failed to explain what the reason might be. 
Other commentators--including Busche in the 24 May SUEDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG, Fuhr in the 26 May FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, and Rainer 
Nahrendorf in the 25 May HANDELSBLATT--expressed concern that 
direct election would destroy the suprapolitical, unifying role 
of the president by making him beholden to particular interests, 
or lead inevitably to an undesirable expansion of the office's 
powers. Leggewie's 25 May DIE TAGESZEITUNG commentary, for 
example, worried that such a presidency would be too vulnerable 
to waves of extremist popular opinion and too powerful if an 
ideologue ever reached office. 
<H5>  Role of Parties Criticized </H5>
  Despite this general rejection of a constitutional shift to 
direct presidential elections, press commentary reflected 
widespread dissatisfaction with the dominant role of party 
politics in Herzog's election. FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU 
commentator Astrid Hoelscher, for example, described the vote in 
that paper's 24 May issue as "remote from the people" 
[volksfern] and maintained that Herzog had been elected due only 
to "the strength of his party, and not his persuasive power as 
an individual." A 24 May DIE TAGESZEITUNG commentary criticized 
the "automatism" of assembly delegates who voted with their 
party rather than their conscience, and Perger, in the 27 May 
DIE ZEIT, complained that "the presidential election was 
turned...into a kind of chancellorship election," where 
delegates were really voting for Scharping or Kohl as party 
leaders, rather than for Rau or Herzog as individuals. Perhaps 
the best summation of the lingering dissatisfaction with the 
election came from Busche's commentary in the 24 May 
SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, which argued that the delegates' 
party-line voting was a violation, not only of the spirit of the 
Basic Law, but also of the public trust. "There is no reason," 
Busche concluded, "for the parties now to turn in satisfaction 
to their agenda of the day. Even if the demand for direct 
elections was ill-considered, the criticism of the parties is 
not."

<F P=106> [Editorial by Guenther Nonnenmacher: "Foreign Policy of </F>
Small Steps"] 
  [Text] It is not expected that foreign policy themes will 
decide the results of the Bundestag election in October, but 
which foreign policy course prevails in the coming years is of 
fateful importance for the future of Germany. 
  Corrections are necessary. The political world changed in 
the 
years 1989-90; hence Germany's position in the world also 
changed. German politics must draw conclusions from this if it 
wants not only to follow the developments resulting from the new 
situation but also to help shape them. This does not at all mean 
that the foreign policy wheel must be reinvented in Bonn or 
Berlin. There are principles, orientations, and ties that have 
proven themselves and that ought to be maintained. Of coure that 
will not be possible by holding onto what has become customary; 
it requires adaptations that are obviously difficult. 
  An example is the debate on new tasks for the Bundeswehr 
that 
go beyond national defense and collective defense in the 
Atlantic alliance. It is therefore characterized by confusion, 
because everything that exceeded this "classic mission" was out 
of bounds until 1989. If many politicians today are warning 
against a "militarization of German foreign policy," this 
absurdity is a result of that situation. 
  The dispute about missions "out of area" is by no means, as 
often asserted, a marginal subject--because intervention with 
military means as in Somalia or in the ruined Yugoslavia are 
said to be the exception anyway and generally unsuccessful and 
because the role of military power in world politics is 
increasingly being replaced by the importance of economic power 
and scientific-technical capabilities. That may be correct in 
part; nevertheless, the dispute about new tasks for the 
Bundeswehr leads directly to the core of German foreign policy: 
to the question of alliance capacity and hence to linkage with 
the West. One of the absurdities is the fact that precisely the 
leftists who originally were not pleased about Adenauer's policy 
of being tied to the West became ardent supporters of this 
policy after unification but simultaneously oppose new tasks for 
the Bundeswehr. 
  If linkage with the West means more than just a feel for a 
way of life or the diffuse perception of belonging together 
politically and culturally, then the word can only mean that 
Germany must be willing to share the responsibility and 
subsequent burdens that its partners and allies are prepared to 
take on--not only under the coercion of the geopolitical 
situation as in the four decades of the postwar era but also 
based on its own resolve after consultations and decisions of 
competent authorities. Solidarity is not flying blind. Nor can 
it be discharged through money and nice words but rather it has 
practical consequences that cannot be avoided by resorting to 
history or a special national ethos. 
  That also includes a German participation, even with 
soldiers, in the arrangements that will be a precondition for a 
peaceful settlement in the former Yugoslavia--possibly in the 
guarding of the borders or the formation of buffer zones between 
the successor states. Every realistic planning for such a case 
requires forces in a magnitude that NATO cannot provide without 
German participation in view of the necessary rotation of the 
units. Therefore, in the event that agreement is reached on a 
lasting and internationally supervised truce, there will be a 
call for the Bundeswehr after a year at the latest--not from 
Bonn but from Washington and Brussels, Paris and London. If the 
Germans were to refuse that, it will have consequences, not only 
for relations in the former Yugoslavia but also for the place of 
Germany in NATO and for the future of the European Union. 
  People are tugging at this second anchor of the commitment 
to 
the West--in part in the leftist and in part in the rightist 
corner of the political spectrum. It is said, for example, that 
the European Community suffered a failure in 1991, because in 
Maastricht it wanted to compartmentalize West Europe instead of 
opening up to the East the union that was decided there. Apart 
from the fact that the word "compartmentalize" does not become 
more correct through repetition: How could one have imagined 
such a rapid opening? As a lightning-accession of the Central 
and East European countries (by the way, which is in and which 
is not?) with full rights and duties? Who would have been 
willing to bear the costs? Who would have benefited from the 
fact that after the collapse of the Eastern markets the Western 
markets would also have run into turbulence? And with which West 
European partner would Germany have found support, and not just 
politically, but also financially? 
  The step-by-step political opening of West Europe to the 
East 
combined with a gradual reduction of customs duties is 
disdained, just as is NATO's Partnership for Peace, because that 
does not correspond to the image of the "bold design" that many 
desk strategists have of politics. But in a world in upheaval, 
in a Europe that has not yet found its new shape, it is more 
reasonable to proceed in short steps over secure terrain than to 
make a great leap and to land in a void.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Finance Minister Theo Waigel by </F>
Editor in Chief Rainer Nahrendorf; place and date not given: 
"Setting a Fixed Date for the Abolition of the Solidarity 
Surcharge Would Lack Sense"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- As Finance Minister Theo Waigel said 
in an interview with HANDELSBLATT, it is true that strong 
economic growth is yielding more money for the state's coffers, 
but the amount is still not as much as was envisaged under the 
original financial plan for 1995. The new taxation estimate, 
which is based on a 3.9-percent nominal growth this year and 4.4 
percent in 1995, will result in a budget deficit of between 9 
and 10 billion German marks [DM] compared to May 1993 estimates. 
The deficit is primarily the result of the 1993 recession. 
  It must now be included in the 1995 budget and compensated 
for by revenue from privatization, the continuation of overall 
spending cuts, savings in expenditure on personnel based on 
moderate wage settlements in 1994, strict adherence to the 
expenditure moratorium, as well as the consistent pursuit of a 
consolidation course. 
  Strong economic growth will not release the federal 
authorities from the obligation of having to consolidate the 
budget. As of 1995, the fund for the repayment of inherited 
debt as well as taking over the debts of the federal and former 
GDR railroads will present enormous challenges. The liabilities 
stemming from taking over Trust Agency debts have been taken 
into account in the budget plans for 1995. Waigel does not 
envisage any other risks. 
  Expenditure on interest rates and liabilities in the social 
services field make a strict continuation of the consolidation 
course imperative. 
<H5>  Debt </H5>
  Waigel rejects the constant accusations that he is solely 
responsible for the debts of DM2 trillion. It is going too far 
to burden him with the laender and municipal authority debts 
totaling DM600 billion. The same applies to the DM300 billion 
debt that already existed in 1982 toward the end of the 
socialist-liberal coalition and was transferred to Finance 
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg. Waigel said: "And I am not 
ashamed of the DM600 billion of state debt prompted by German 
unity." 
  To reduce the high level of taxation and state expenditure, 
it is necessary to keep the increase in the budget below the 
nominal GDP growth rate. In Waigel's opinion, this goal must be 
pursued over the entire upcoming parliamentary term. The 1994 
federal budget has already resulted in nominal reductions for a 
whole series of individual budgets. This will continue in a 
similar form in the 1995 budget. 
  Only a strict consolidation course will result in a 
reduction 
in the net borrowing. This is not only necessary to fulfill the 
Maastricht Treaty criteria, but also in view of interest rate 
trends on the capital markets. No other expenditure programs 
would be possible. Waigel said: "If a new expenditure priority 
appears in one place, then is must be compensated for by 
financing elsewhere." The government has been successful over 
the past few years with this principle, and it must continue to 
adhere to it. 
  The principle also applies in the case of formulating the 
joint CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union] election program. The proviso attached to all the points 
contained in the program is the availability of finance. After 
1995, the highest priority is the use of all possible room for 
maneuver to reduce taxes and ancillary wage costs. Higher 
taxation must be accepted over a certain period of time, because 
of the historic event of unification. However, this should not 
be some kind of permanent state of affairs, or the growth that 
has been achieved will be lost. 
Solidarity Surcharge 
  If the liberals want the solidarity surcharge to be limited 
to a set period of time, then they are calling for more than is 
possible in economic terms at the present time. Waigel gave 
assurances that he wants to do something about income tax rates 
and then about the solidarity surcharge. He said he was in 
favor of an annual review of the solidarity surcharge and a 
reduction as soon as that is possible. However, it would be 
unrealistic to set a date for canceling the solidarity 
surcharge, which will be collected as of 1 January 1995. The 
revenue from the solidarity surcharge will be necessary to 
service the fund for the repayment of inherited debt to the tune 
of almost DM40 billion. 
  Waigel warned against reducing the taxation burden at the 
price of increasing the net borrowing. This would prompt 
negative reactions from the markets and possibly from the 
Bundesbank, too. Frankly, if higher interest rates were the 
result, that would be a disaster. 
  The example of the United States, which lowered taxes in the 
hope of achieving higher revenues, is instructive. It did 
indeed lead to an improvement in the economy, but also to an 
enormous budget deficit at the same time. In any event, Waigel 
does not underestimate the value of tax cuts as a means of 
introducing dynamism into the economy. The economy is 
influenced by medium-term goals and psychology. 
  That is why the fixed period consolidation course undertaken 
by the coalition was so important. The coalition started 
pursuing consolidation in the recession and was now accelerating 
it through the federal consolidation package and the savings, 
consolidation, and growth package. Waigel pointed out that the 
capital markets had been relieved of quite a burden as a result 
of consolidation and the introduction of the solidarity 
surcharge as of 1995. This has made it easier for the 
Bundesbank to make decisions and has led to the relatively low 
interest rates. Medium-term tax cuts are also part of this 
long-term orientation. 
  In the future, the Bundesbank will also continue to pursue 
a taxation policy oriented toward growth, performance, the 
family, and medium-size businesses. Apart from continuing with 
the tax-free status of the minimum wage within the framework of 
a system of taxes based on performance and the simplification of 
taxation, a further focus of attention will be an improvement in 
the general conditions under which companies operate and thus in 
the framework conditions for jobs. Waigel includes among these 
points a reduction in corporate tax, the exemption of the tax on 
nonrevenue wealth in the new laender beyond 1995, as well as the 
principle of transferring to the country of origin the levying 
of value-added tax in the European Union [EU]. The introduction 
of this principle will mean that deliveries of goods within the 
community will essentially be treated as domestic deliveries. 
<H5>  Taxation Rates </H5>
  The reduction in corporate tax within the framework of the 
law on safeguarding Germany's future as a center for business as 
well as lowering the taxation of income from business activity 
to 47 percent were considerable successes, said Waigel. He 
conceded that this differentiation of taxation rates was not 
attractive from the viewpoint of the overall taxation system. 
However, in view of the reductions in the transfer payments to 
the eastern laender that were instituted at the same time, it 
would not have been acceptable for big earners in show business, 
sports, and politics to pay less tax. 
  The tax relief on savings for medium-size businesses has not 
been pursued by the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] as 
Oskar Lafontaine told HANDELSBLATT (the issue of 10-11 June 
1994). In fact, during the mediation process on safeguarding 
Germany's future as a center for business, the SPD did more to 
prevent the introduction of the tax relief on savings on 1 
January 1994. It will not come into force until 1 January 1995. 
  In its taxation and budget policies, the coalition 
government 
has always sought to maintain a social balance. The solidarity 
surcharge will preserve that balance. Until now, the costs of 
German unity have to a large extent been borne by so-called 
"better earners." The "better earners" have been wrongly drawn 
into a discussion that is wrong. Waigel said: "I have not seen 
any signs of a lack of justice." Waigel pointed to the 
progressive taxation rates and the increase in the tax on 
private wealth. If one looks at the solidarity surcharge rates 
for earners of low, medium, and high incomes, then one can see 
that a social balance has also been retained in this area. 
  The abolition of the solidarity surcharge called for by the 
SPD and its replacement by a 10-percent supplementary charge for 
gross incomes above DM60,000/DM120,000 (single/married) would 
impose a further burden on self-employed higher earners and 
would thus be counterproductive. 
  Waigel asked at what level the incomes of better earners 
really start. If one takes the figures given by Mr. Scharping, 
namely, an income of DM50,000 for single people, one is already 
in the average-income bracket. If one considers Scharping's 
statement to a French newspaper on how the supplementary charge 
is to provide as much revenue as the solidarity surcharge, it 
would have to already apply to gross incomes above DM44,000 in 
the case of single people and DM88,000 in the case of married 
couples. In net terms, that is, after the deduction of all 
taxes and dues, it would mean about DM2,300 in the case of 
single people. 
  If one wanted to excuse 80 percent of taxpayers, then there 
would be a budget shortfall of about DM7.5 billion. That is why 
SPD demands for a supplementary charge are lacking sense in 
fiscal terms. The SPD's fiscal and tax policies have made the 
party lose credibility and that rebounded on it at the elections 
last Sunday [12 June]. Waigel pointed out that the solidarity 
surcharge had been approved with votes from laender governed by 
the SPD. 
<H5>  Valuation Rates </H5>
  On the question of inheritance and wealth taxes, Waigel said 
he wanted to wait to see what the Federal Constitutional Court's 
position is on valuation criteria. Essentially, he considers it 
right to retain a form of revenue-based taxation and not to 
introduce valuation criteria based on market rates. If the 
Federal Constitutional Court decides that the 1964 valuation 
criteria are no longer valid, it might also be possible to 
achieve a settlement in keeping with the constitution using 
differentiated surcharges. However, the federal authorities, 
laender, and municipalities should not attempt to obtain higher 
revenues through new criteria for the valuation of land holdings. 
  In Waigel's opinion, a carbon dioxide energy tax should 
impose a further burden on the economy. He said that the 
conditions for the introduction of a carbon dioxide energy tax 
were that taxes would not be raised, that there would be 
competitive neutrality, which means that Germany should not 
introduce such a tax by itself, and that it could be used to 
direct a specific ecological course, that is to say, no forms of 
energy containing carbon dioxide should be exempted. 
<H5>  Taxation of Interest </H5>
  Waigel stressed that the harmonization of interest rate 
taxation in Europe would be a main focus of attention for the 
German EU presidency, which begins on 1 July of this year. Now 
that a liberalization of the movement of capital within the EU 
has been achieved, it must be ensured that no new competitive 
inequalities arise as a result of the differences in the 
taxation of revenue from capital assets. Different systems are 
used within the EU; in some countries there are notification 
systems and in others taxation at source. 
  Waigel is seeking a settlement based on the principle of 
subsidiarity, a settlement that would essentially leave each 
country's national taxation system untouched, but would, at the 
same time, make it impossible to evade the obligation to pay 
tax. This does not amount to trying to square a circle, but can 
easily be achieved. Member states that have a notification 
system would be able to retain it and place such information at 
the disposal of member states with a deduction of tax system. 
On the other hand, countries using a system based on the 
deduction of tax must ensure that deductions are also made in 
the case of EU foreigners. Waigel said that he did not think 
that off-shore places such as the Channel Islands posed a great 
problem.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dieter Schulte, chairman of the Federation </F>
of German Trade Unions, by Martin Kempe and Ulrike Fuessel in 
Berlin; date not given: "The Money Is There"] 
  [Text] [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Mr. Schulte, do you still 
think that full employment can be achieved through economic 
growth? 
  [Schulte] We know from experience that a beginning economic 
growth does not immediately create more jobs. In my view we 
will not return to the classic form of full employment in the 
near future. At the same time, we know that almost every 
community, every city is putting off a number of projects 
because they simply do not have the funds. These investments 
must be made now. We call on the political and business 
community to shift the money that is spent on unemployment and 
the resulting problems to a temporary employment policy with 
state orders. One must also think twice about spending billions 
of German marks in Hermes export guarantees instead of providing 
more money for badly needed public orders. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] What are the tasks that you have in 
mind? 
  [Schulte] Nursing sick people, kindergartens. We are 
speaking of the traffic collapse or of traffic chaos. Everybody 
wants to modernize the infrastructure and further extend the 
networks, but we are not making any progress. In the cities and 
communities the water supply and sewage systems must be renewed. 
The money is there. It only has to be shifted to the right 
place. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] What comes to your mind when you 
hear the slogan of limits to growth? 
  [Schulte] I think that we will have to change our way of 
thinking. Industrial production will no longer grow in the FRG. 
Industrial developments will reach their limits. Employment 
will, thus, necessarily have to shift toward the sector of 
public services. I am not only referring to services people can 
claim and cannot do without, but also services in other areas 
near the economy. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] What is the trade unions' 
contribution to reducing mass unemployment? 
  [Schulte] The wage agreements intended to secure jobs are a 
contribution that must not be underestimated. The effects of 
shorter working hours had been disputed for a long time. So it 
is a success that such models have, at least temporarily, 
stopped the increase in unemployment. Moreover we demand that 
those shoulders that can carry more must do so. The funds must 
then be used specifically, for example for investment programs 
in eastern Germany. If we manage to reduce by half the number 
of unemployed by the year 2000, which is a challenge for all of 
Europe, then this is a great objective. At the same time, we 
must answer the question how we will deal until then with the 
people who have no jobs and no chances ever to get one again. 
We must build job bridges... 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] ....to the second labor market? 
  [Schulte] I am not speaking of the second labor market. The 
question of a second labor market, that is to say one of 
inferior value, is not what comes to my mind first. After all, 
this leads to an inner detachment from one's employment and also 
from the trade unions. This is why I reject this term. We will 
have to find promising forms of employment that stand on a solid 
financial basis. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Can you imagine a strategy of 
shorter working hours and redistribution of work that goes 
beyond the Volkswagen scheme? 
  [Schulte] No. I think that the schemes of shorter working 
hours in this classic form, for example the shorter working week 
at Volkswagen, have, at least for the time being, reached their 
limit. However, one will have to try out other schemes, also 
part-time work. Most companies have not given a moment's 
thought to how they could sensibly introduce part-time work. 
Yet, even part-time work will only solve one part of the 
problem. Employees will not accept it if they are forced to, 
but only when it fits the personal plans for their lives. 
Moreover, one has to find regulations to prevent people from 
suffering disadvantages later in life. Still, it might lead to 
more possibilities for flexibility. 
  [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Your vision of work mainly refers to 
gainful employment. Yet there is a lot of work necessary in 
society that has to be done privately or without pay. Would it 
not be interesting to link these two spheres and rethink the 
structures of our society? 
  [Schulte] There is enough work. Whether it can be paid 
depends on the readiness to provide money for it. Some 15-20 
years ago, we set ourselves the objective to use some time of 
one's working life for education. Today this issue is no longer 
on the agenda, because people do not even use the available 
possibilities. If we really want to focus on work again then we 
must pay more attention again to such points.

<F P=106> [Interview with Klaus Murmann, president of the Federation </F>
of German Employers' Association, by Andreas Bohne; place and 
date not given: "In 1995 There Will Not Be More But Fewer 
Unemployed"] 
  [Text] [Bohne] When will the upswing bring more jobs? 
  [Murmann] In 1995 we will, all in all, not have more but 
fewer unemployed. This year we will have 3.8 million registered 
unemployed. Out of this basic unemployment we will be able to 
fill several hundred thousands of additional jobs in 1995. Of 
course, this is not sufficient, measured in terms of the total 
number of unemployed, to which one must add the approximately 
1.5 million people who are involved in job-creation and 
advanced-training programs. By the way, three months ago I said 
that in 1994 the number of unemployed would rise not by 500,000 
but only by 300,000. 
  [Bohne] Do the private labor exchange offices finally reveal 
those jobs that have so far not been reported to the state's 
labor exchange offices? 
  [Murmann] Not all of them, but many. And if more people are 
now recruited from jobs that are already filled, this can be 
accepted. This is simply part of the free play of forces, and, 
in the end, private labor exchange offices are a help. I hope 
that the law will not be delayed and that the new labor exchange 
offices may start very soon. 
  [Bohne] Are you for entrance-level wages for unemployed 
people? 
  [Murmann] In 1994 we agreed on entrance-level wages in the 
chemical industry, which are 90 percent of the normal wages. I 
would like other industries to adopt this model, too. 
  [Bohne] The chancellor has vehemently called for more 
part-time jobs. 
  [Murmann] Indeed, this is an important potential. But many 
say that this is not a good idea. 
  [Bohne] You too? 
  [Murmann] It is not the only good idea, but it is certainly 
one of the possibilities that offer the most chances. The way 
of thinking is a problem in this respect. We must get rid of 
this blockade. And this needs time, because at the moment it is 
typical German social behavior to say: Anyone who works 
part-time has lower social prestige. 
  [Bohne] Meaning that he probably has not found anything 
better? 
  [Murmann] Quite so. Jobs like yours and mine can allegedly 
not be split up, which is complete nonsense. In particular, 
men, too, must get used to the idea that they can work part-time. 
  [Bohne] And employers, too? 
  [Murmann] Even more so. The broad middle echelon is still 
braking this process, but not so much top management. All in 
all, we must come to completely new forms of work time. Today 
only machine time counts in industry. A completely flexible 
model should be developed for how the work can be distributed to 
make sure that machine time is at its optimum. 
  [Bohne] Many of your colleagues remain skeptical. 
  [Murmann] I tell them two things: First, many jobs that are 
divided produce higher productivity. The standard example is a 
person feeding in data in electronic data processing: If you do 
this for four hours you are more productive than if you do this 
for eight hours. This is quite clear. 
  [Bohne] Thus, it is not true that the performance of a job 
goes down if the job is divided? 
  [Murmann] No. My second argument is this: We lose more 
than 50 billion marks [DM] of expenditure per year because of 
absenteeism, whether for alleged or real illness. These 
absences would go down considerably. 
  [Bohne] In which economic sectors can Germany afford highly 
qualified and correspondingly well-paid labor? 
  [Murmann] Where German industry is traditionally strong, we 
will maintain our position only through technical progress. In 
machine-building, in the metal and electrical industries, in 
automobile construction, and in the chemical industry, we have 
productive jobs that can tolerate the corresponding wages. 
  [Bohne] Where does the opposite apply? 
  [Murmann] The opposite begins for me in the job "household, 
yard, and garden," which has now also been discovered by 
politics. Here we have an important field, which is related to 
services and in which the potential for additional jobs must be 
exploited. 
  [Bohne] Does this also apply to nursing the elderly and to 
caring for children? 
  [Murmann] The social sector would be the second large 
additional area. Here we are not facing international 
competition, here the price of labor must develop at the 
national level. However, this price must not be so prohibitively 
high that -- as is the case now -- no jobs are created. 
  [Bohne] The qualifications of many of the long-term 
unemployed are no longer in demand on the market -- what do you 
tell them? 
  [Murmann] Of the 36 million people gainfully employed in our 
country 10 to 15 percent are not sufficiently qualified or could 
be qualified more. This is the depressing thing. Society -- 
and also the partners to the wage negotiations -- must create a 
work environment that offers these people value-creating, 
satisfying work again. In the recession many people lost their 
jobs who would never have thought that this would happen. 
Unfortunately, in many cases they cannot expect to find work 
with the same income and status as in the past. And with all 
due respect to the individual's situation: It is necessary also 
to accept jobs with lower qualifications, because in the long 
run we cannot pay the costs of unemployment of about DM110 
billion per year. 
  [Bohne] Do we need more entrepreneurial spirit among the 
general population? 
  [Murmann] Absolutely, yes. This is a very decisive factor 
for the dynamism of the economy. In the new laender the number 
of those becoming self-employed is remarkably high. 
  [Bohne] What incentives can one provide for that? 
  [Murmann] The state could perhaps provide tax incentives. 
However, I believe that private investors would be called upon 
to act far more. 
  [Bohne] Should the banks issue loans more easily? 
  [Murmann] There is a lack of risk capital. If I want to 
raise a loan on my grandmother's house, I get it. If I want to 
do that on an invention that has not yet proved its worth on the 
market, this is much more difficult. 
  [Bohne] Subcontractors in housing construction, 
self-employed computer experts in companies, time work: The 
trade unions reject forms of work that are a transition toward a 
more entrepreneurial spirit as "unprotected employment." 
  [Murmann] With our rigid system we have catapulted ourselves 
into large-scale underemployment. The trade unions will have to 
resign themselves to the change. 
  [Bohne] Is participation in shaping this change a task for 
the new DGB [German Trade Union Federation] chairman? 
  [Murmann] Of course. This week the DGB Federal Congress 
will take place. I would like to make a very clear appeal to 
the trade unions and to the new DGB chairman. The parties to 
the wage negotiations have a decisive coresponsibility for the 
situation in the German labor market. We live up to this 
responsibility only if we give up old rigid patterns and become 
more flexible in work time and in wages. We must get away from 
thinking in terms of the masses and move toward wages that are 
shaped more in line with company requirements and also include 
company profits as an element. 
  [Bohne] As of next year the state will once again reduce the 
income of a young employee who currently gets DM3,700 net out of 
his gross salary of DM6,500. How can one still provide 
motivation for performance in view of this? 
  [Murmann] Politics is called upon to reduce the tax quota -- 
otherwise, we do not get the economic dynamism that we need to 
stimulate the labor market. 
  [Bohne] You are referring to domestic demand? 
  [Murmann] Yes, apart from exports, I consider domestic 
demand to be essential. 
  [Bohne] To reduce taxes, the state must cut expenditure. 
Where can it do that? 
  [Murmann] Our administration is too expensive. This applies 
in particular to the east. There the share of the public sector 
in the overall number of working people is about 30 percent 
higher than in western Germany. We simply cannot afford this. 
Many of the 6.6 million jobs in the public sector must be 
abolished. Even if one just does not hire new people for any 
job, a considerable saving is very quickly achieved. The 
greatest potential for saving is in the personnel in the public 
sector. 
  [Bohne] Could a red-green election victory endanger Germany 
as a business location? 
  [Murmann] Industry and its representatives will cooperate 
with any democratically elected federal government. But the 
citizen Murmann would consider participation by the Greens in a 
federal government as something that would make things very 
difficult for industry. Regarding the Social Democrats, it is 
to be feared that a federal government led by them would relapse 
into the political patterns of the past: redistribution and 
enlargement of the social state to the detriment of economic 
dynamism. I have criticized the current coalition often. This 
criticism is still valid concerning nursing-care insurance, for 
instance. However, over the past 12 to 15 months correct 
approaches have been made. This has come late, but not too 
late. I, for my part, could live well with a continuation of 
this coalition.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dominic Johnson: "Accomplice With a Bad </F>
Conscience"] 
  [Text] The time has come for punitive expeditions. If a 
French military intervention really takes place in Rwanda in the 
next few days, France will return to its African "backyard" with 
a stir. 
  Such an intervention, no matter how humanitarian French 
politicians may present it, is regarded as taking sides in 
Rwanda -- taking the wrong side. Admittedly, French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe, the driving force behind an intervention, 
does not completely share the blind loyalty to [deceased Rwandan 
President Juvenal] Habyarimana with large parts of the French 
establishment, and he calls the events in Rwanda "genocide," 
expressly meaning the activities of the government troops by 
this. "Those who have committed, promoted, or covered up 
massacres" shall be excluded from the necessary national 
reconciliation process in Rwanda. Nevertheless, Juppe cannot 
ignore certain facts: The French have supported Juvenal 
Habyarimana's regime -- whose murder triggered the new round of 
civil war -- for decades. It was the French who established, 
equipped, and trained the Rwandan Army after civil war broke out 
in 1990. Certain Frenchmen seem to have stayed in the country 
after UN troops were stationed there in the autumn of 1993, 
training the militarily organized opponents of a peace between 
the government and the guerrilla forces in militias and thus 
paving the way for a new war. No matter what Juppe says, if 
armed Frenchmen go back to Rwanda, the mass murderers in the 
militias loyal to the government will cheer them, and the 
guerrillas, who are also fighting a war, but who do not 
deliberately kill civilians, will fight against them. 
  What is the purpose of such an intervention? The latest 
statements from Paris say that the French are to stay until the 
UN blue helmets have arrived. But why then does France not 
simply help the UN go to Rwanda quickly? The fact that various 
African states want to join the French mission adds to the 
confusion. Will we soon have "French" Senegalese and UN 
Senegalese drive around Rwanda trying to fulfill the same 
"humanitarian" mission? Either France really wants to fulfill a 
humanitarian mission -- in the current situation this must 
primarily mean taking victims away from the militias in Kigali, 
which would double the UN mission -- or France wants to achieve 
something else. But this would immediately give rise to 
accusations, and maybe the fact, of siding with murderers. 
  The central problem is: For France, Africa is a big parade 
ground. Where can France play superpower if not in Africa, 
where certain Parisian circles can do a lot of damage with 
little effort? On the other hand: How severe can the damage be 
without doing irreparable harm to the superpower's prestige? 
Rwanda is an excellent stage for gaining new importance through 
cheap effects. Comparisons of the planned French action with the 
landing of the U.S. Marines on the Somali coast in December 1992 
are quite interesting. Back then, the Marines did not achieve 
any results, but all of a sudden the United States had a 
glorious new Africa policy -- if only for a short time. Perhaps 
the French intervention in Rwanda will lead to the French shadow 
diplomacy, which has been a major promoter of the war, having to 
step down in favor of a commitment that is more suitable. 
Juppe's attempt, which is more cautious than President 
Mitterrand's talk of "a matter of hours," and has been agreed 
upon with the UN, shows first signs of a bad conscience for the 
murderous consequences of the French policy conducted so far. A 
France that no longer wants to be an accomplice and therefore 
intervenes against itself? This would be the only slightly 
favorable interpretation of events that must be found simply 
catastrophic otherwise.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Lothar Ruehl: "A Measure of Strength"] </F>
  [Text] Basically, NATO has reached agreement with the 
Russian Government concerning the conditions and limits of 
security-linked and political cooperation within the framework 
of Partnership for Peace [PFP]. Therefore there is a likelihood 
of more stable relations between the two countries. However, 
the problem of each country's different attitude toward other 
East European countries has not been resolved. 
  Nevertheless, despite the differences in view, a consensus 
has been reached on Russian Defense Minister Grachev's demands 
concerning the extent of NATO and its role vis-a-vis the CSCE, 
these demands having been rejected by the allies. According to 
this consensus, NATO will not accept any new countries that 
share a border with Russia. The emergence of a new dividing 
line through East Europe is to be avoided by means of the PFP, 
but no one knows how. 
  The most important issue in this sphere, i.e. the extent of 
the alliance east of Germany, remains open. Signing a 
partnership agreement with Russia in Brussels does not yet 
justify any special privileges for Russia vis-a-vis NATO, as 
President Yeltsin would like. The prospect of NATO admission by 
the four East and Central European countries was brought 
somewhat closer by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at 
the NATO foreign ministers conference in Istanbul at the 
beginning of June. But this question, too, remains open. 
  Moscow still expects an Atlantic-European gesture of 
recognition for its great power status for the benefit of 
European security, with this recognition assuming a concrete, 
binding form. Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev has merely 
agreed to NATO assurances to seek a broader basis for a 
relationship with Russia. German Foreign Minister Kinkel has 
been saying cautiously in public that the "discord" between 
Moscow and NATO on this issue was "reduced" in Istanbul, which 
means that this discord still exists. A special protective and 
order-creating function by Russia within CIS has also not been 
recognized by NATO. NATO and the remaining East European 
countries have forced their wishes upon Moscow on the subject of 
all these controversial issues. 
  On the other hand, Kozyrev won a major concession in 
Istanbul 
on the central issue of an eastward expansion of NATO. 
According to this concession, NATO is to postpone any decision 
concerning the acceptance of new member countries. A clause 
describing the significance of such NATO partnerships for the 
future admission of individual countries to NATO was deleted 
from the draft communique at Istanbul. The effect of this is 
that the admission of new countries to NATO is more doubtful 
than the efforts of aspiring East European countries would have 
us believe. 
  The framework of strategic cooperation for a broader Russian 
relationship with NATO, which is what Kozyrev wants, basically 
conforms to the "strategic partnership" concept presented by 
U.S. President Clinton and NATO Secretary General Woerner in 
Moscow early in the year. Kozyrev's remark that this 
cooperation would take place without mutual vetoes and 
reservations indicates a deep-lying compromise formula -- no 
prerogatives on either side. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Christopher has described this 
compromise in the following terms: "This is the most creative 
strategic innovation since NATO's inception." However, he made 
it plain that "neither new demarcation lines nor new spheres of 
interests" may emerge in Europe. No country may claim for 
itself a role that is not compatible with international norms, 
according to Christopher. And: European stability is 
conditional on a respect by all countries of the independence 
and territorial integrity of the countries of the former Soviet 
Union. 
  The indication of a rejection of the Russian demands 
repeatedly expressed by Yeltsin and Kozyrev since 1993, and 
therefore of the Russian doctrine whereby Russia bears special 
responsibility toward the "near abroad," i.e. the countries of 
the former USSR, could not be clearer in diplomatic terms. But 
the failure to resolve the problem of a hierarchy of interests 
between the United States, NATO, and the remaining partners has 
been made equally clear in Polish Foreign Minister Olechowski's 
warning of a "marginalization of smaller countries in the 
region." The various interests must first be brought down to a 
common denominator if a new European balance is to be created. 
  This is also the reason that there is going to be great 
interest in Russian relationships with the G-7 countries at the 
world economic meeting whose political part will be attended by 
Russian President Yeltsin in Naples this year. That is also the 
main reason for Yeltsin's rapid agreement to the Istanbul 
compromise formula. After the establishment of a possible "G-7 
plus one," everything else would follow smoothly.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, June 21 (AFP) -- France failed Tuesday 
[21 June] to attract international military backing for its bid 
to mount an armed intervention in Rwanda, though French troops 
were already deploying along the bloodied nation's borders. 
  Member nations of the Western European Union (WEU) offered 
logistical support to the proposed French-led intervention to 
end the slaughter in the central African country, but Paris 
failed to win pledges of troops. 
  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur admitted Tuesday to 
members of the National Assembly in Paris that "only" Italy in 
Europe and "only" Senegal among African states were prepared to 
commit troops. 
  Balladur stressed any deployment would require authorisation 
from the United Nations. French officials, who had planned to 
send 1,000-2,000 troops, said they still intended to press for a 
Security Council vote on Wednesday. 
  The troops would be stationed in Zaire close to the border, 
but not on Rwandan territory and their operations would be 
strictly humanitarian, the premier was quoted as saying by a 
leader of his parliamentary group. 
  Balladur also stressed that other countries would have to 
send troops and that the force would "in no case" carry out 
operations "in the heart of Rwanda." 
  "Most WEU countries are ready to provide logistical support 
of one kind or another," one diplomat said after a meeting here 
of ambassadors in the WEU, which includes all European Union 
countries apart from Denmark and Ireland. 
  But the support was conditional on a new UN Security Council 
resolution backing France and the WEU wanted African troops to 
be part of the force. 
  In Ottawa, the Canadian foreign ministry said Tuesday it was 
prepared to send 350 communications specialists to Rwanda within 
weeks if requested by the United Nations. 
  At UN headquarters in New York, Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali reaffirmed his support for the French plan for 
intervention in Rwanda, his spokesman said. 
  Boutros-Ghali is aware of members' concerns about the 
proposed military mission to end the bloodbath that began April 
6, but will not back down from his support for the plan, said 
Joe Sills. 
  A French military "assessment" team of some 15 soldiers 
arrived Monday in Goma, eastern Zaire, to prepare for the 
planned intervention, sources in Kinshasa close to the operation 
code-named "Turquoise" said. 
  But the French plan aroused bitter hostility from the mainly 
Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which accuses Paris 
of arming government troops and being indirectly responsible for 
massacres carried out by extremist militias of the Hutu 
majority. [passage omitted] 
  Paris wants to deploy the force until Boutros-Ghali succeeds 
in a bid to boost the UN mission from just 495 men to about 
5,500, mainly troops from Africa, which could take three months.

<F P=106> [Article by Patrick de Saint-Exupery: "Rwanda: Complicated </F>
and Hazardous `Humanitarian' Intervention"] 
  [Excerpts] The "duty of intervention" in Rwanda advocated 
by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on Wednesday [15 June] is a 
matter fraught with questions. Deploying 1,000-2,000 soldiers is 
proving an extremely complicated issue and above all, a 
"hazardous" one, according to Alain Juppe. Nevertheless, 
President Francois Mitterrand insisted on French determination 
this weekend, even if it means that Paris has to act alone, he 
argued. The genocide that has been going on in Rwanda is no 
longer "tolerable." The following is a compendium of questions 
raised by the notion of such an intervention. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  How Can This Intervention Be Carried Out? </H5>
  Several potential scenarios have been identified. It appears 
that the most likely one would entail establishing a rear base 
on the Zairian-Rwandan border. Initially 800 French soldiers 
would be stationed there. From this base, they would enter 
Rwanda, focusing exclusively on the regions held by government 
forces and militias. Their mission would be to protect dozens of 
areas containing Tutsi refugees "threatened by extermination" by 
militias and government forces. The whole operation would 
gradually unfold until French soldiers succeeded in protecting 
several such areas and saving thousands of people who may 
otherwise be killed at any moment. 
  This scenario is dependent on President Mobutu's consent. 
Zaire's head of state has given no formal answer yet. However, 
Zairian diplomatic sources indicate a concern to "stop the 
slaughter." 
<H5>  What Means Will Be Made Available to French Soldiers? </H5>
  They will be significant, and the operation will be quite a 
large one. The Americans, Belgians, and Italians are reportedly 
ready to provide logistical support. As for the French 
Government, it is willing to go quite far: 1,000 professional 
soldiers would be deployed initially, including 600 belonging to 
the ground forces and 400 men performing support tasks 
(logistical, air control, helicopter crews, etc.). A second 
wave comprising another 1,000 men would stand by, ready to act 
within 24 hours. 
  Only professional soldiers will take part in the operation. 
Most elite units (paratroopers, the Foreign Legion, and marine 
troops) will be called upon. 
  The first troops will be taken from permanent bases in 
Africa 
(Central African Republic, Gabon, Ivory Coast, and Djibouti). 
Bangui would be used as an "operational platform." 
<H5>  When Would All This Happen? </H5>
  Shortly. President Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur, Alain Juppe, [Rally for the Republic President] 
Jacques Chirac, and several political leaders have all agreed on 
the "urgency" of the situation. The first units will probably 
be deployed as soon as the United Nations has approved a 
resolution authorizing French soldiers to act under Chapter 7 
("possible use of force"). According to the Quai d'Orsay [French 
Foreign Ministry], it is "almost certain" that such a resolution 
will be passed. China, which is generally adamant about the 
principle of noninterference in a state's internal affairs, has 
reportedly agreed to abstain, considering there is "genocide" 
taking place. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, June 21 (AFP) -- The Rwandan Patriotic Front 
(RPF), strongly opposed to planned French military intervention 
in Rwanda, on Tuesday [21 June] denied a report that a senior 
RPF official would hold talks with the French government. 
  Jacques Bihozagara, RPF representative in Brussels, is "not 
coming to Paris," his staff in the Belgian capital told AFP, 
reached by telephone. 
  French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin had earlier said 
on French radio that Bihozagara was expected in Paris on Tuesday 
for talks with the Minister Delegate for Humanitarian Action 
Lucette Michaux-Chevry. 
  France has launched major diplomatic efforts to try to 
persuade the mainly Tutsi rebel front that its plan to send up 
to 2,000 soldiers to Rwanda and lead a mission to protect 
civilians there is purely "humanitarian." 
  But the RPF accuses Paris of arming its opponents in the 
mainly Hutu government army, who in turn trained Hutu extremist 
militias accused of the massacre of up to half a million Tutsis 
and moderate Hutus. 
  Asked about reports of the RPF official's visit, French 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Richard Duque said the French 
government was "available" to see him. 
  Bihozagara was named deputy prime minister in a 
power-sharing 
arrangement cut between the rebels and Rwandan authorities last 
August after three years of civil war. 
  But the government never took shape and the central African 
nation plunged back into bloodletting in April.

  [Text] Paris, June 21 (AFP) -- More than 20 French 
charities and development assistance groups have formed a 
committee to oppose French plans for military intervention in 
Rwanda, they announced on Tuesday [21 June]. 
  "The French government cannot intervene directly in Rwanda, 
its past in that country is already too weighty and its 
activities have been too pronounced," the chairman of the 
Medicins du Monde (MDM; Doctors of the World) Bernard Granjon 
told a press conference held to launch the committee. 
  He called instead for armed deployment and "humanitarian 
intervention by the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda". 
  The mainly Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) has 
warned it will resist French military deployment, accusing Paris 
of backing the Hutu majority, training the army and being 
indirectly responsible for the ethnic massacres of hundreds of 
thousands of Tutsis and opposition Hutus by extremist militias. 
  Other member associations of the France-Rwanda National 
Solidarity Committee include Pharmaciens sans Frontieres (PSF; 
Pharmacists without Borders), Handicap International and 
SOS-Racisme. 
  In the Rwandan capital Kigali, two PSF personnel complained 
Tuesday that they had been ordered to leave because of the 
French plans for military intervention. 
  "We have the impression of betraying everybody," one of 
them, 
Michel Sounalet, said before they joined a UN convoy heading for 
neighbouring Tanzania. 
  Another member of PSF, which has been working with orphans, 
distributing food and medicines to people hiding from death 
squads and helping in the evacuation of endangered children from 
the bloodied Rwandan capital, will remain in Kigali. 
  Speaking at the Paris press conference, another PSF 
representative, Claude Simonot, said there should be no military 
intervention at the expense of humanitarian relief. 
  The UN Security Council was Tuesday to debate a French draft 
resolution proposing to send in up to 2,000 French troops and 
head military intervention until the United Nations can beef up 
its mission in Rwanda.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "As of 1 July: France Reorganizes </F>
Its Military Representation to NATO"] 
  [Text] France has appointed General Patrick Woillez to a 
newly created senior position in NATO. This choice reflects the 
government's determination to accommodate its military 
representation to the structure of the major allied commands, 
whose current reorganization is scheduled for completion in 
1995. Prompted by the end of the Cold War in Europe, this 
reorganization consists in personnel reductions within military 
commands with a view to reducing operating costs. 
  To take effect on 1 July, the government has appointed Air 
Force Brigadier General Woillez as head of the French military 
mission to the Commander in Chief of Allied Forces for 
Northwestern Europe (CINCNORTHWEST). This command is based in 
High Wycombe (Great Britain) and is intended to combine two 
previously distinct allied commands: The Northern European 
Command (CINCNORTH), which covers allied forces in Norway and on 
the Baltic coastline, on the one hand, and CINCUKAIR, the 
command which includes the United Kingdom's NATO Air Force, on 
the other hand. 
  The new allied command for northwestern Europe is under the 
authority of the General Headquarters of Allied Forces in Europe 
(SACEUR), headed by U.S. General George Joulwan and based in 
Mons, Belgium. 
  The newly created French military mission with the new 
Northwestern European Command will fall under the command of 
Admiral Lanxade, chief of staff of the French Armed Forces, 
through the French representative to NATO's Military Committee, 
Air Force Major General Jean-Paul Pelisson. The 51-year-old 
General Woillez, whose position was created within the scope the 
reorganization of NATO's commands, was formerly deputy chief of 
the "Planning, Programming, and Evaluation" Division of the 
French Armed Forces' staff headquarters. 
  It has already been a year since France appointed Rear 
Admiral Dominique Raguet as its representative in Naples, where 
the Allied Command for Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH) is located. 
The Naples headquarters controls allied (land, naval, and air) 
forces deployed in southern Europe as well as NATO's 
intervention force. A number of these units have been enforcing 
the UN embargo against Serbia and Montenegro since the beginning 
of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. 
  This summer, France also plans to appoint Brigadier General 
Gerard Folio as its military representative with the General 
Allied Command for Central Europe (CINCENT), located in 
Brunssum, the Netherlands. Like the new Northwestern European 
Command, the CINCSOUTH and CINCENT commands come under General 
Joulwan's direct authority.

  [Text] A meeting of some 20 French ambassadors to Africa in 
Dakar has ended. They were meeting with the French foreign 
minister and the French cooperation minister. Obviously a lot 
was said about the effects of the devaluation of the African 
Financial Community [CFA] franc. Nicolas Balique: 
  [Balique] There were two leitmotivs during this meeting, 
which was attended by 20 or so ambassadors not only to 
francophone Africa, but also to anglophone countries, such as 
Nigeria and Ghana, and Portuguese-speaking countries, such a s 
Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. 
  First there was the follow-up to the so-called 
postdevaluation period. According to Mr. Juppe, the first 
results are promising for the change in parity regarded as 
essential, and which certainly does not mean any sort of 
abandonment by France. The French foreign minister added that 
some 6 billion French francs, out of the 12 billion scheduled 
for this year, had been released by the main partners of the CFA 
zone. 
  The second aspect was the process of democratization. Here 
too encouraging signs were noted, in spite of some backward 
steps, especially in Burundi and Nigeria. The main thing, said 
Mr. Juppe at the closing ceremony of this third meeting of 
ambassadors -- coming after the ones in Tokyo and New Delhi -- 
is to keep heading toward democracy which is closely tied to the 
economic recovery of the countries involved.

<F P=106> [Interview with Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin by </F>
correspondent Nicolas Balique in Dakar; date not given; from the 
"Afrique Soir" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Roussin] It can already be said that the situation 
is rather good, but we cannot be over optimistic. It is a 
difficult operation, people need a great deal of courage to 
endure this very important change and a few more months will be 
needed to make sure that things are moving in the right 
direction. In any case, France stands side by side with Africa, 
working with it and supporting it, doing what we have already 
been doing since January, namely, ensuring a very concrete 
follow-up with very significant measures taken as time goes by 
to help our partners live through this difficult period. 
  [Balique] The key word is recovery, both internal and 
export-driven. According to your information, are encouraging 
signs or shudders already visible? The case of the Ivory Coast 
is an example, but is there any other? 
  [Roussin] I believe that we could go beyond your excellent 
wording, you say shudders, I believe that we can go beyond that. 
There are very encouraging signs in a certain number of 
countries, I am thinking of Burkina Faso. You mentioned the 
Ivory Coast, one could also speak of the situation in Gabon and, 
since we are in Dakar, of positive developments in the 
Senegalese capital. I can observe very encouraging signs, but 
other conditions must be met for a genuine recovery. Legal 
guarantees, a single legal system, are needed to give a certain 
number of guarantees to investors. A noticeable growth must be 
observed too. I am very optimistic and I am convinced that we 
will see growth resume and, at last, development become a 
reality. 
  [Balique] Some French businessmen complain of difficulties 
encountered in transferring funds. 
  [Roussin] Rightly so. You are right to stress this problem. 
Some of our fellow nationals who are doing business in Africa 
encounter very serious difficulties. My mission is to listen to 
them and persuade my colleagues, the economics minister and the 
minister for social affairs, to make sure that problems 
encountered by our fellow countrymen facing difficult times are 
being taken in consideration. I met a certain number of French 
businessmen in Dakar today, they are facing very serious 
difficulties and I appealed to the president of the republic. I 
asked him to make sure that when measures are taken concerning 
the settlement of the foreign debt, measures will also be taken 
to guarantee that debts owed to French businesses by, let us 
say, the Senegalese Government, are settled as well, because 
businesses too are sometimes owed very large sums of money. In 
the current situation Senegal must absolutely do something for 
French businesses.

<F P=106> [Report signed "P.R.-D.": "Mr. Emmanuelli's Changing </F>
`Sectarianism'"] 
  [Text] Michel Rocard claimed to speak the truth. Henri 
Emmanuelli practises blunt speaking. "I would always prefer to 
be a left-wing brute who works rather than an anesthetized 
Parisian intellectual," he explained last September. "Nuances," 
he also said, "are valuable for thinking but a hindrance to 
action." Since he entered politics, this man has been unable to 
escape his caricature. It can be summed up in a few words: 
gloomy, irritable, archaic, and sectarian. It hampers him, 
serves him, and protects him all at the same time. On Sunday, 
19 June, it made him first secretary of a Socialist Party [PS] 
which is seeking an identity. 
  He brings to the party the perfect background of the 
grandson of a Corsican shepherd, the son of two Communist 
militants, orphaned early in life by the death of his 
working-class father, who was electrocuted in a work accident in 
1958. He also offers it the career of a child whose fragile 
health and modest background did not prevent him from becoming a 
student of political science, and then starting his career 
through the prestigious door of the financial company of the 
Edmond de Rothschild bank. He also has a long record as a 
militant, close to Mitterrandism, within the Convention of 
Republican Institutions, and then the PS. 
  He also brings the support of his region which, from his 
election in 1978 as deputy for Les Landes, and his accession, 
four years later, to the chairmanship of the regional council, 
has never been disputed. His entry into government as secretary 
of state for the overseas departements and territories from 1981 
to 1983, then secretary of state for the budget until 1986, 
confers on him a national political dimension. His election in 
January 1992 as speaker of the National Assembly made him the 
fourth-ranking person in the state for a year. 
<H5>  Loyal to the President </H5>
  This model career would suffice to give him legitimacy. 
Events have added a dramatic dimension. In July 1992, the day 
of the opening of the PS congress in Bordeaux, the man who was 
the party's national treasurer learned, in the press, that he 
was to be charged by Judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke, who was 
investigating various cases to do with the activity of the 
consultancy offices providing the PS' secret funding. For the 
members meeting that day, Henri Emmanuelli became a symbol. In 
order to "restore" his "honor," the following year, when he was 
brought before the magistrate, Henri Emmanuelli was bold enough 
to resign as deputy and verify with pride that he still had the 
confidence of the voters in Les Landes. 
  These successes conferred on him a freedom of speech which 
he 
has never abanoned. A loyal supporter of Mitterrand (the 
president's residence at Latche is in his constituency), he can 
also be surly and rebellious. In March 1990, he contributed to 
the failure of Laurent Fabius' first attempt to take control of 
the PS in the battle of the Rennes congress. At the time, 
Fabius's supporters did not have words harsh enough to mock the 
"archaism" of the deputy for Les Landes who, having become 
president of the National Assembly's Finance Committee in 1991, 
sometimes virulently opposed the political and economic 
policiesi of Pierre Beregovoy. 
  Paradoxically, this same "archaism" became one of Henri 
Emmanuelli's major assets on Sunday [19 June] in his accession 
to the post of first secretary of a party desperately seeking to 
regain a left-wing label. As for the sectarianism with which 
the deputy's name is associated, it has proved capable of 
change: from April 1993, when he was the architect of the "coup" 
perpetrated by the Rocard clan against Laurent Fabius, to this 
June Sunday which marked his collaboration with his former enemy 
to succeed Michel Rocard.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "French and German Manufacturers </F>
Agree To Build New Armored Vehicle"] 
  [Text] A consortium comprising two French manufacturers, 
Giat Industries and Panhard, and two German ones, Krauss Maffei 
and Mercedes Benz, will establish a joint venture in June 1995 
to produce a range of wheeled armored vehicles for the French 
and German Armed Forces, representatives of the four companies 
announced in Paris yesterday. 
  The project was presented one day before the opening of 
Eurosatory '94 (Le Bourget's land-based weapons show). The 
armored vehicles will be manufactured in two basic versions: a 
six-wheel and an eight-wheel model. Production lines will start 
running in 1998 and the vehicles are scheduled for delivery to 
the Armed Forces in 2002. 
  By the year 2000, both the French and German Armies will 
need 
3,000 such vehicles, whose unit cost must not exceed 5 million 
francs. 
  The future troop transporter will accommodate up to nine 
soldiers with their equipment and weapons, in addition to a crew 
of two. It will be able to carry various types of turrets such 
as one fitted with a 45-mm gun, or even the 120-mm gun turret 
which is being developed for the future French weapons system 
carrier. It will also be able to operate as a command car or an 
ambulance. 
<H5>  Two Assembly Lines </H5>
  Designed to blend the tactical mobility of a battle tank 
with 
the strategic mobility of a truck, the new armored vehicle will 
feature a light and very strong body made of a special aluminum 
alloy. Its maximum speed will be 120 km per hour, its maximum 
range will exceed 750 kilometers, and it will be equipped with a 
central system for inflating or deflating its tires while 
running to ensure optimal adjustment to the terrain. 
  The formal timetable is as follows: The four members of the 
consortium will sign the joint venture agreement in late 1994, 
before establishing, in June 1995, a common subsidiary whose 
ownership will be 50 percent French and 50 percent German. 
  Germany's Krauss Maffei and France's Giat Industries will 
both operate an assembly line, while Panhard will manufacture 
custom vehicles made to specific consumer requirements.

Francois Leotard. [passage omitted] 
  Several senators are worried about the nuclear deterrence 
issue, which has been a subject of contention between the 
president of the Republic and the government. Mr. de Villepin 
expressed doubts as to the "realism of the determination to 
implement" the nuclear program "without additional testing." 
Mr. Leotard demonstrated complete agreement, indicating that 
"test simulations will not be sufficient to exempt France from 
actually performing additional testing." "Not a single 
scientist or member of the scientific community ever told me 
otherwise," he added.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent in Birmingham Jean-Francois </F>
Polo: "Declining French Electricity Requirements -- French 
Electricity Company Will Order No Nuclear Plant in Next Five 
Years"] 
  [Excerpts] The French nuclear energy program has just 
suffered a setback. Aware of the low increase in electricity 
demand in mainland France as well as the high productivity rate 
of its power plants, EDF [French Electricity Company] will place 
no new order for nuclear reactors for at least five years, CEO 
Francois Ailleret announced in Birmingham on the occasion of the 
23d UNIPEDE congress, which brings together Europe's major 
electricity companies. 
  It is the first time that such a long suspension has been 
decided since France launched its large-scale nuclear program 20 
years ago. This decision may cause problems for boiler 
manufacturer Framatome, which had been hoping for an order from 
EDF by 1997 and which will have to make do with maintenance work 
to maintain its know-how. 
  The nuclear industry is not the only one hit by the slower 
growth in power requirements. According to EDF, which reviewed 
the matter at its board meeting last Friday [17 June], there is 
"no need to order any new power generation equipment, whether 
nuclear or not, before the end of the decade, except for Corsica 
and overseas territories." 
  Scheduled to invest 38.9 billion francs [Fr] this year, 
including Fr7.5 billion for nuclear power generation, Fr.7.5 
billion for power transmission, and Fr16.1 billion for power 
distribution, EDF has decided to order only two gas turbines 
instead of a an anticipated six. As for power export levels 
(currently at 63 billion kilowatt-hour [kWh]), they are expected 
to increase only slightly, to 70 billion kWh, within 10 years. 
[passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, EDF's CEO indicated that the public utility is 
ready to pay "a significant amount" to fund the closure of the 
Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine. According to Mr. Ailleret, 
"the odds are better than ever" that reactor number one will be 
shut down by this winter, with the rest of the plant being shut 
down within two or three years, when construction currently 
under way has been completed. The reported cost of the closure 
program is about Fr10 billion.

  [Text] Paris, June 21 (AFP) -- The U.S. firm Sheffield 
Medical Technologies and a French government research institute 
announced Tuesday [21 June] they would join forces to develop a 
French-conceived AIDS vaccine. 
  Tests using a prototype of the vaccine on monkeys have been 
promising, said Jean-Claude Chermann, head of the National 
Institute of Health and Medical Research and a co-discoverer of 
the AIDS virus in 1983 when he worked at the Pasteur Institute. 
  If all goes well, tests on humans will begin in mid-1995 
under the supervision of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 
he added. 
  The vaccine is designed to be taken orally along with the 
polio vaccine, which is relatively low-cost and easy to use, and 
thus make the AIDS vaccine widely accessible in Africa, he added.

<F P=106> [Report by Carlo Pizzati: "Italian-U.S. Fisheries War"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Enzo Maiorca is furious. For three weeks he has 
been trying to get his colleagues in the National Alliance to 
understand the importance and the seriousness for our economy of 
a letter which he has received from the U.S. Embassy: Italy 
risks a billion-dollar embargo if it does not give up fishing 
swordfish with nets which are more than 2.5 kilometers long. 
But no one apparently wants to listen to him. 
  Gregory Dunne, scientific attache at the U.S. Embassy in 
Rome, in a letter sent on 27 May to the senator, who is already 
the world skin diving record holder, was clear: If Agriculture 
Minister Adriana Poli Bortone (National Alliance) does not 
withdraw her intention to legalize the increase in the length of 
the nets used for fishing swordfish from 2.5 kilometers to 9 
kilometers, Italy risks a commercial embargo on all fishery 
products in an amount of $1 billion or some 1,600 billion lire a 
year. [passage omitted] 
  "The American Government," Dunne writes in his letter, "is 
constrained by law to impose commercial sanctions on countries 
which fail to respect international directives." Adding on a 
more conciliatory note: "Both our countries wish to avoid such 
commercial damage and a pointless diplomatic dispute." And in 
any event the United States had already requested tighter 
controls on swordfish fishing, even before Minister Poli 
Bortone's intervention. What we have here is not interference in 
domestic affairs, the diplomat seems to be wanting to say, but 
sanctions which the United States are bound to apply under a 
very precise law, approved two years ago, against those 
countries which use methods which are damaging to the marine 
ecosystem. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Christian Democratic Center </F>
leader Pierferdinando Casini in Rome; date not given: "Single 
Party Is the Inevitable Choice" -- first paragraph is LA 
REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- "Yes, I believe that we shall be able to 
call it the Freedom Party. Something is already happening in 
the south: We have there sections of the Freedom Alliance 
consisting of Forza Italia, the National Alliance [AN], and us, 
the CCD [Christian Democratic Center]. Another small step, and 
we are there. Together with [Interior Minister] Maroni and 
[Defense Minister] Previti, CCD leader Pierferdinando Casini is 
one of the most convinced supporters of the need to merge the 
various center-right forces into a `single party.'" 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] You are insisting heavily, but the 
resistance 
-- in particular from the League -- is strong. Do you believe 
that the project will come about in the end? 
  [Casini] I would answer like this: If it does not come 
about, the Freedom Alliance will never really get off the 
ground. We are halfway there. We must decide whether to remain 
with the ambiguity of an electoral system which is no longer 
proportional but not yet totally majority-based, or to take the 
remaining step. And it is clear that a decision to move ahead 
has to mean uniting the forces of the alignment, on the one 
hand, and of the Left on the other, into single groupings. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] You could also not take that step. 
  [Casini] Here the reply is even simpler: The way to a new 
electoral system with a single ballot and without any recovery 
through the proportional system is either via a vote in 
parliament with the agreement of the Left, or a referendum. I 
believe that the process needs to be put into motion rapidly, in 
time for the next regional elections, which ought to go hand in 
hand with the direct election of the president and a pure 
single-member system. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Who is for and who is against the "single 
party" within the Freedom Alliance? 
  [Casini] The discussion is very open. [AN leader] Fini is 
already dealing with the process as it relates to his AN. 
Within Forza Italia, on the other hand, two lines exist side by 
side. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] How? 
  [Casini] Some people are trying to formalize an assumed 
hegemony. I am saying only: Let's calculate, because Forza 
Italia's 30 percent is more the outcome of emotion than a solid 
consensus. And then let us look at the preference votes in the 
European elections: Berlusconi gets 600,000 votes, the next man 
50,000. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] And the League. [League Secretary] Bossi 
does not want to hear of a "single party." 
  [Casini] Bossi many times says the right things. But in this 
case his reasoning is shortsighted. Like that of my PPI 
[Italian Popular Party] friends, moreover. We are discussing a 
two-party system and they do not yet accept the concept of 
bipolarity.

<F P=106> [Article by Alessandra Longo: "Task Force of 40-Somethings </F>
Formed To `Marry' MSI and AN"] 
  [Text] "The party? It is like a father. Then one meets a 
girl...." So says Marco Zacchera, the man whom Fini has 
appointed as head of "organization." 
  "There has never been a bust of Il Duce on my desk... On the 
contrary: The other day, as soon as my appointment became 
official, a party member said to me: `Marco, I am going to bring 
you something nice, a souvenir...' I quickly retorted: `Thanks, 
but I am interested only if it has a value on the antiques 
market....'" 
  Marco Zacchera, 42 years old, with a 14-year-old daughter, 
sits behind the new desk assigned to him by MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] Secretary Gianfranco Fini. A desk that suddenly has 
become a nerve-center. He was appointed to "head the 
organization of the party." It is he who will have to resolve 
the squabbles that break out in the party's sections and local 
headquarters, including those stemming from the disruptive 
presence of the new symbol, the AN [National Alliance]. It is he 
who will oversee the issuance of membership cards. 
  Previously, Alterio Matteoli headed membership. He is now 
assigned to environment issues. But previously, the MSI was an 
opposition party. And previously, above all, there was not that 
still mysterious catchall called the AN. 
  Zacchera, a Piedmontese, a Bocconi graduate in economics and 
trade, a former regional councilman, and now a newly elected 
member of the Chamber of Deputies, is aware of having taken on a 
thankless task: "This is not an easy moment for our militants. 
Many still have the mentality of those who have always been on 
the outside. They use the blunt language of opposition. After 
years of darkness they see people arriving whom they do not 
know, people appearing on `their' electoral lists, those from 
the AN... And they ask themselves: `Who are these people? Where 
do they come from?' I understand bewilderment and diffidence. I 
do not understand, and I reject, nostalgic attitudes, attitudes 
of outward bunkering; those, I do not understand; they only do 
us harm. On the outside we are still branded, labeled; but in 
all truth, the MSI's members sometimes bring it on themselves." 
  The so-called Fini team consists of the 40-somethings within 
the party. They will have to deal with those who, like Teodoro 
Buontempo, of the purist and hard-line wing, called for a 
"moratorium" until the party congress. Deputies Roberto Menia 
from Trieste and Gianni Mastrangelo from Apulia will be working 
with Zacchera. They will have to coordinate with Antonio 
Mazzone, a deputy from Naples, the new head of local agencies, 
who in turn will have four teammates: Riccardo Migliori 
(regional policies); Giuseppe Tagliente, mayor of Vasto, 
(mayoral activities); Vincenzo Nespoli (municipalities); and 
Marcello Perina (provinces). As yet unfilled is the void in the 
public relations sector, a sensitive task. The candidate's name 
most frequently whispered is that of Gianni Alemanno, a Rauti 
follower. 
  A party made up solely of "Finians?" Zacchera smiles: 
"Obviously, the secretary prefers to put himself in the hands of 
people who are in agreement with him. But this does not mean 
being dogmatic. I have many friends also among the Rautians." 
  First rule: Develop the art of getting along. "I learned 
that 
in the family," the new head of organization says. His family is 
of DC [Christian Democratic Party] extraction and culture. In 
1946, his grandfather was the DC leader in Verbania, Zacchera's 
hometown. His father was deputy mayor of Stresa. Five brothers, 
"five diverse opinions." "My brother Vittorio," says Zacchera, 
"was a communal councilman in Verbania under the banner of the 
hammer and sickle. I was there too, but as group leader of the 
MSI..." 
  "I am not a nostalgic," says Zacchera. True, but there are a 
lot of nostalgia still about, and it will be difficult to get 
them to swallow the secretary's "reform" views... The 
nostalgists are afraid to lose their roots. They want neither to 
abjure nor to repudiate them, and they do not appreciate the 
passage in Fini's remarks to the Chamber, in which he said: 
"Antifascism has been an essential step toward democracy..." 
Zacchera leaves no doubt as to his leanings: "I identify fully 
with those remarks... I am a convinced supporter of the AN. The 
MSI must be structured in such a way as to be able to talk with 
the AN. It must convince its members of this... Dissolve the 
MSI? I am absolutely certain that the secretary has no such 
thought of doing it, just like that, on the spot, one two. Only 
a party congress can decide to merge with the AN. But these 
things must be worked out little by little..." 
  What relations does Zacchera have with the old party? "The 
party is like a father. You love him, you respect him. Then, one 
day..." One day... enter the AN? "Yes, one day, you find a 
pretty girl and you fall in love. Father remains in your heart, 
but you marry. And you can only hope he will bless the 
nuptials... and life goes on."

<F P=106> [Report by Gennaro Schettino: "Economic Package: Dispute </F>
Within Government; Dini: Action on Taxes Essential"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The state budget situation looks very bad, 
but there is already a dispute within the government on how to 
reduce the deficit. On the one hand there are the "guardians" 
of the state budget -- led by the treasury minister, and 
including the League's ministers -- who want an immediate 
substantial economic package. And they are not afraid to talk in 
terms of new taxes to compensate for overspending. On the other 
hand, however, there are those who are promising to reduce the 
public deficit miraculously without any cuts or new taxes. This 
team is headed by Transportation Minister Publio Fiori. It 
seems that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi himself also belongs 
to this band of "optimists." Yesterday the two alignments 
engaged in an open confrontation, brandishing their weapons. 
  After a very heated day on the financial markets, Treasury 
Minister Lamberto Dini -- who is officially responsible for 
drawing up the economic package -- issued a note in an attempt 
to calm the atmosphere. Dini stated clearly that the package 
will be a substantial one and will affect this year's budget. 
The treasury minister does not intend to allow the deficit to 
exceed the established limit by a single lira. 
  How does he intend to do this? Very likely, by bringing 
forward a large part of the 1995 Finance Bill, making some of 
its measures effective this year. This will deal a blow to 
pensions and health provisions in the second half of this year. 
Dini was very explicit: He wants to prevent a currency crisis 
from overwhelming the lira and the Italian Stock Exchange. Be 
that as it may, the treasury minister interprets current events 
on the financial markets as a temporary phenomenon. Short-lived 
turbulence, Dini said, is inevitable in strongly integrated 
markets, and sometimes leads to unjustified "excessive" 
movements. The treasury minister warned, however, that people 
must not have any illusions: Unjustified increases in public 
expenditure "will be counterbalanced by specific measures to 
increase public revenue." By so saying Dini reaffirmed that the 
Constitutional Court's ruling on pensions will be complied by 
means of ad hoc measures. But any other possible overspends 
will also be counterbalanced by taxation. This, starting with 
the 4-5 trillion lire needed this year to limit the deficit to 
154 trillion lire. So Dini considers any unrest and tension 
with regard to government bonds unjustified. 
  "The behavior of the international financial markets," the 
treasury minister wrote, "has been countered in recent weeks. 
There have been substantial increases in interest rates on 
government bonds in all the major industrial countries, 
accompanied by considerable fluctuations in the exchange rate of 
the dollar against other currencies. Short-term fluctuations," 
the minister explained, "are inevitable in strongly integrated 
markets that interact and sometimes produce excessive movements 
in the exchange rates themselves.. Indeed, the major rise in 
interest rates on long-term stock is neither explained nor 
justified by the current or expected rate of inflation. The 
lira and interest rates on government bonds," the treasury 
minister continued, "have suffered as a result of these 
disturbances. Apart from this, there have been a number of 
internal developments liable to increase public spending that 
will be counterbalanced by specific measures to increase 
revenue." This was an unmistakable reference to the ruling on 
pensions. The new taxes will not only serve to fill the 30 
trillion lire INPS [National Social Security Institute] gap. 
"The work on reforming public finance will continue," the 
minister added, "through a corrective measure with respect to 
the deficit for the current year and more especially for1995." 
So Dini is clearly calling loudly for a substantial and rapid 
action including measures that will hit Italians in their 
pockets in the coming months. The League's Vito Gnutti, the 
industry minister, spoke in a similar vein yesterday: "If there 
is any overspending," he said in Bologna, "the response in terms 
of the need for an economic package would be obvious." 
  A very different plan for public finances is being put 
forward by the other side, which we could call the government's 
optimists. "I have in mind," Fiori said, "a plan for 50 
trillion lire involving no cuts and no new taxes. It will will 
bring in the 50 trillion lire that we need to fill the INPS gap 
and to resolve the most immediate public finance problems." The 
transportation minister declined to say any more about his plan 
to reform public finances. But he did issue this sharp verdict 
on the treasury minister's plan: "I disagree with Minister Dini 
about the need for an immediate package; we won the elections on 
the basis of a distinct policy and we have never considered 
constituting a second Ciampi government. I have clear ideas 
about the Finance Bill. I expect," Dini went on, "not a drastic 
bill, but a sensible one that will not misrepresent the 
situation but that will aim to develop and revive the economy." 
What is the nature of this plan? We will hear it from Fiori in 
a few days' time. Fortunately, yesterday ended with some wise 
remarks from Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio. We must 
beware, he said, not to try to stray from the path of economic 
reform with "coercive measures" affecting the public debt. It 
is a long road, Fazio warned, and the only way to go is "an 
incisive and gradual reduction of spending requirements."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Alberto Ronchey: "Three Men in a Boat and a </F>
Middle Course"] 
  [Text] Since the 12 June elections [Northern League 
Secretary] Bossi seems to be increasingly on a collision course 
with [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi. This, because he can 
see the League's electorate being encroached on by his pushy 
ally, with his image as the first businessman to head a 
government, and his government by television penetrating 
everyone's homes. Perhaps the inventor of Forza Italia will not 
demolish the League's base in the deep north. But, as some 
sociologists have pointed out, it is focusing on the urban 
services sector and industry in the provinces. It is gathering 
support among the fluctuating bourgeoisie that is crying out for 
optimism and expects another Italian miracle capable of pushing 
prosperity well beyond the level of "a little workshop and a 
little Alfa Romeo," despite the millions of billions of public 
debt and the troubles affecting big industry. Can people be 
permitted to dream? It is natural, in every era and under any 
conditions, as Manilov showed in Gogol's "Dead Souls." 
  This is a desperate situation for the League leadership. And 
the prospects are of conflict between Bossi and Berlusconi, 
partly because they share no common language that can reconcile 
the League's unsophisticated supporters in the valleys and city 
outskirts with the Berlusconi supporters, who prefer to talk 
about opinion polls, targets, ratings, and shares. 
  The level of the conflict is rising, partly because, after 
the [former League ideologue] Miglio case it has become apparent 
that Berlusconi is unwilling to pay any special regard to the 
unruly Bossi. So the latter's fundamental survival instinct is 
coming into play, and that can prove fierce. 
  His ministers in the government seem more cautious, but they 
all share the survival instinct, which prompts "that crazy uncle 
from Brianza" [Bossi] to sometimes go too far. 
  Other League representatives point out that it is 
unnecessary, even dangerous, to attack Berlusconi every day, but 
add that it would be unacceptable to dissolve into the 
"Berlusconi soup." 
  So how, for instance, will the League's parliamentarians 
vote 
when the television decree is debated? This document, subject 
to several amendments before becoming law, may perhaps gain 
garner some additional support capable of investing, through 
drastic regulations, Berlusconi's shares in order to resolve the 
conflict between public and private interests. For weeks Bossi 
has been criticizing Fininvest -- the private half of the 
political authority of television -- while controversy raged 
over the spoils sharing system that has for years dominated the 
RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], which can now be either 
freed from this system or subjected to it once more. 
  But there is more besides the skirmishes between the two 
most 
obvious antagonists. Bossi has all the more reason, if 
possible, to be on a collision course with [National Alliance 
leader] Gianfranco Fini. This, because the League's voters in 
the Po Valley are demanding autonomy for local government to 
levy taxes right away and abhor the leanings toward state 
control and welfarism of the postfascists, who have their 
dominant strongholds from Rome southward. And also because 
Bossi's supporters are remote from the bureaucracy in Rome, 
whereas Fini's supporters have always had reference points there 
and are indeed exerting pressure on and surfacing in every 
department. 
  Bossi can also consider himself free from any electoral pact 
with Fini. While the balance of forces in the Senate remains 
uncertain, the main coalition in the Chamber of Deputies 
consists of two separate alliances -- between Berlusconi and 
Bossi in the north and between Berlusconi and Fini in the south. 
There was no joint program among the three at the national level 
for the March elections, nor are there any direct relations 
between Bossi and Fini. But behind Fini there is now emerging a 
substantial band of "comrades" who retract nothing with regard 
to fascism, and "all their pride lies in that nothing." 
  This being so, how are parliamentary proceedings likely to 
be 
in the near future? Already in the dispute over committee 
chairmanships, the government alignment lost in the Senate, 
5-13, because it refused to believe that an understanding with 
the opposition forces was opportune, not on the basis of the old 
and deplorable system of "associationism" but from the viewpoint 
of the balance of forces. Be that as it may, what are those 
five committees worth, if the chairmen on the government side, 
almost all of them making their debut, are not acquainted, 
through inexperience, with every aspect of the regulations and 
every aspect of parliamentary practice? 
  Parliament already has to consider some 70 decrees on 
urgent matters that have yet to be made law. Then there will be 
the budget session, with the Finance Bill and its "supplement," 
with insufficient scope to satisfy the government's legislative 
ambitions. Among other things, it will be necessary to fill the 
financial chasm, some 30 trillion lire, created in the budget by 
two rulings by the Constitutional Court concerning INPS 
[National Social Security Institute] pensions. How often will 
the government be defeated in the Senate? These are troubled 
times, despite the prime minister's persistent optimism since 
the 12 June elections, just a month after the inauguration of 
his new ministers, at a time when nobody could yet judge their 
work in relation to the promises and expectations. 
  If, moreover, the government's uncomfortable position in the 
Senate is exacerbated by conflicts among the three major groups 
within the coalition, plus the demands of the minor groups, in 
the months ahead we may witness an outright storm in parliament. 
Certainly, Berlusconi will claim credit for any partial success 
and will blame any possible failure on the other forces' 
parliamentary strategy, will talk about ungovernability, and 
will threaten another early election. But what will his chances 
in six months' time, or more be? And what will the opinion 
polls show, assuming that the president agrees to another 
election? 
  Under such circumstances, anything is possible. Indeed, any 
observer can only be considered reliable for 24 hours. This is 
the case of the daily newspaper, which knows everything, but 
what it knows changes every day. Silvio Berlusconi has promised 
a firm hand and a "middle course." But in some respects, and 
without any rash forecasts of the outcome of the enterprise, the 
situation is reminiscent of Jerome K. Jerome's story about that 
high-spirited and adventurous river outing, "Three Men in a 
Boat": "I was at the tiller..."

<F P=106> ["Debate" article by Transportation Minister Jan Trojborg: </F>
"The Swedes Finally Made Up Their Minds"] 
  [Text] The Swedes finally made up their minds. But as we 
know, reaching the final decision on the Oresund project was not 
without its cost for the Swedish Government. 
  The Swedish yes gave the real starting signal for the 
marketing of the whole of the Oresund region. And there should 
now be room for a more visionary debate on priorities and the 
exploitation of the many possibilities that the fixed link 
across the Oresund brings with it. 
  Even though there were probably very few people who could 
imagine the Swedes running away from a crystal-clear agreement, 
it is at least a fact that words like "water throughflow" and 
"water rights court" have surfaced more frequently than concepts 
such as growth and vision when the Oresund link has been 
discussed recently. 
  Of course it has been both necessary and important to 
guarantee a zero solution out of respect for the environment. 
The debate on the environment has also been extremely useful, 
even though it has at times been excessively technical. But at 
present what is important is to look forward. With the fixed 
link, Malmo-Lund will be linked to Denmark's capital city region 
in one continuous Oresund region, and this will make it possible 
to take up the struggle with Europe's other big cities. 
  Integration and growth will not of course follow 
automatically on the fixed link, but the necessary preconditions 
will be in place. 
  The project is first and foremost an investment in a piece 
of 
infrastructure that will make transport time between Malmo and 
Copenhagen almost insignificant. When the fixed link is 
finished around the turn of the century it will be both quick 
and cheap to get from one side of the sound to the other, 
especially if you travel by train. 
  Precisely because the Oresund link represents a conscious 
investment in public transportation in the Oresund region, it 
will be much cheaper to chose the most environmentally friendly 
way to cross the sound -- namely, taking the train. 
  The Oresund link will on the whole create a number of 
traffic 
improvements in and around the capital with particular emphasis 
on the public transportation sector. 
  Thus the Oresund link is a conscious investment in 
Copenhagen 
and the capital region. 
  In the first instance the actual work of construction will 
create hundreds of jobs in and around Copenhagen. 
  But it is of course more important that in the longer term 
the Oresund link will hopefully also be able to give Copenhagen 
a much needed boost. 
  I am convinced that it will be possible for Copenhagen to 
exploit the combination of good infrastructure and well-sited 
industrial development areas -- not least Orestaden -- to set in 
motion in earnest competitive urban development. 
  A number of initiatives linked to the Oresund link -- 
chiefly 
the Orestad Company, the Oresund Committee, and Copenhagen 
Capacity -- have already been launched. 
  Now that the final decision about the link has been made, 
the 
various initiatives should be translated into action as soon as 
possible, so that from the start the capital will be able to 
exploit and fill the role of the Oresund region as the 
growth-dominated center in northern Europe. Remember that the 
Oresund region is a region characterized by economic prosperity, 
a well-educated labor force, a high level of public services, 
and a clean urban environment. 
  Further, the region is centrally placed between Scandinavia 
and the Continent and between western and eastern Europe -- 
something that is underlined by the fixed link. In a large 
number of fields it will therefore be natural to exploit the 
possibilities that a united Oresund region brings with it. 
  Two obvious examples that can be mentioned are the education 
and research sector and the transportation sector. 
  In the region there are universities and institutes of 
higher 
education with places for over 100,000 students. 
  The new transportation possibilities will make it possible 
for the students to choose the best teaching from a long list of 
educational establishments, and it will also be possible to make 
more effective use of research and education establishments on 
both sides of the sound. 
  In the transportation and distribution sector Denmark 
already 
belongs to the super league, but with a fixed link with Sweden 
the Danish transportation sector will have yet another strong 
card in its hand in the tough competition in Europe. 
  In particular Kastrup airport will of course acquire a 
better 
position in the competition with other European airports. Both 
because the potential passenger catchment area will expand 
dramatically, and because with the construction of a railroad 
station in the airport a new and very smooth link with the 
public transportation system will be created. 
  As a Dane I think that there is good reason to be happy that 
with Sweden's final yes a very important step has been taken 
along the road toward creating a united and dynamic Oresund 
region. 
  It is of importance to all of Denmark that with the Oresund 
link we will be creating some of the most fundamental 
preconditions for increased growth in the capital. 
  For regardless of whether you live in Hobro, Ronne, or 
Glostrup the same rules apply: Investments in and around 
Copenhagen benefit the whole of Danish society more than 
investments made in Hamburg.

<F P=106> [Report by Bjarne Nitovuori: "Aho's EU Line Won a Clear </F>
Victory"] 
  [Excerpts] Jyvaskyla -- The Aho government's line on the 
European Union [EU] issue received clear support at the Center 
Party congress in Jyvaskyla yesterday. A vote of 1,607 against 
834 approved a resolution, which means that the government can 
continue to work on the EU process that is aiming at EU 
membership from the beginning of next year. [passage omitted] 
  At a news conference afterward Prime Minister Esko Aho 
himself said that the figures were not dramatic. They 
correspond to the relative strengths that were to be found in 
the party delegation and the Riksdag group when the Center Party 
decided to support an EC membership application just over two 
years ago, he said. 
  The result means that the authority to sign the EU agreement 
can be granted tomorrow without a government crisis and also 
that Esko Aho does not need to carry out his threat to resign as 
party chairman. 
  The resolution does not mean that the congress gave its 
express support to EU membership. It expressed its support for 
Esko Aho's government and its line on the EU question. [passage 
omitted] 
  However, the speech that attracted most attention yesterday 
was not by Aho but by Paavo Vayrynen who lost the vote and 
consequently suffered a new loss of prestige. Vayrynen 
explained why he does not approve of the EU agreement. 
  "It was a major strategic mistake to approve so poor a 
negotiated package. An even bigger -- fateful -- mistake will 
be made if the Center Party congress approves this agreement 
here today," Vayrynen said. 
  He said that the congress is of crucial importance. 
  "If this congress allows the EU train to travel onward to 
the 
granting of approval for the authority to sign the agreement, to 
a referendum, and to discussion by the Eduskunta it will be 
almost impossible to stop it any longer," he said. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Mikael Pentikainen: "National Defense </F>
Information Planning Board Poll: Nearly Half Support EU 
Membership"] 
  [Text] Support for Finland's membership in the European 
Union [EU] has been growing over the last six months. In 
April-May, 48 percent supported it. An opinion poll commissioned 
by the National Defense Information Planning Board (MTS) reports 
this. 
  Since 41 percent supported it in a similar poll last 
October, 
the increase is slightly larger than the margin for error. 
  The Finnish Gallup Company interviewed 1,001 Finns in person 
for the MTS between 25 April and 15 May. The question on the EU 
in the poll went as follows: "What is your opinion on our 
country's membership in the EU? Do you support Finland's 
membership in the EU or not?" 
  In the latest poll, 32 percent of the respondents opposed 
it. 
Their number has decreased by 4 percentage points during the 
past six months. A fifth of them either could not or would not 
voice an opinion. 
<H5>  Women More Opposed Than Men </H5>
  Men clearly more enthusiastically support Finland's 
membership than do women: Fifty-four percent of the men are for 
membership while 43 percent of the women are of this opinion. 
  The most suspicious of the age groups of membership is the 
50-64 group, in which there are slightly more opponents of it 
than supporters. In the other age groups there are clearly more 
supporters than opponents. 
  Sixty-one percent of the high school graduates support 
membership, while 37 percent of the elementary school graduates 
are in favor of membership. 
  Of the occupational categories, the most vehement opponents 
are farmers, 16 percent of whom would bring Finland into the EU. 
Forty-two percent of the workers want membership, and 36 percent 
oppose it. 
  About 60 percent of businessmen and white-collar workers are 
in favor of membership. 
<H5>  More Opponents Among Centrists </H5>
  Of the followers of the different parties, the Conservatives 
are the most enthusiastic supporters of membership. Seventy-one 
percent of them support membership. Support for membership among 
Social Democratic Party [SDP] constituents is 54 percent and 
opposition to it is 27 percent. In the Center Party the relative 
strength is 45 to 35 against membership. Supporters of 
membership among the Greens, according to the poll, are in the 
majority with 43 percent for and 30 percent against it. In the 
Left League the opponents have the upper hand with a percentage 
ratio of 60 to 31. 
  The poll commissioned by the MTS also indicates that 
citizens 
feel that Finland's economic situation is improving. 
  Fifty-three percent of the interviewees think that Finland's 
economic situation is reducing their security. Six months ago 78 
percent of them were of this opinion. 
<H5>  TV News Poll: Support for EU Is Appropriate </H5>
  According to an opinion poll made public Tuesday [7 June] on 
the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation television news, Finns' 
views on EU membership remained nearly unchanged throughout the 
spring. 
  According to the poll, 44 percent of all Finns supported 
membership in the EU at the end of May and the beginning of 
June. Thirty percent of them opposed membership and 26 percent 
could not yet voice an opinion. 
  Last April 47 percent of them supported it, 31 opposed it, 
and 21 percent could not voice an opinion.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Norway's DAGBLADET Reports: Nordic </F>
Countries Will Follow Suit in EU Referenda"] 
  [Text] Oslo -- Finns, Swedes, and Norwegians's views on EU 
membership will be influenced by the order in which the 
referenda are held and their results. A decision to join the 
European Union [EU] made in two of the Nordic countries will 
increase the number of supporters in the third applicant country 
and vice versa. 
  This is maintained in a report published Tuesday [7 June] in 
the Norwegian daily DAGBLADET. The paper interviewed 2,500 
Nordic nationals in May. A thousand of them were interviewed in 
both Norway and Sweden, and 500 in Finland. 
  Especially opponents of EU membership suspect that the 
so-called domino effect will happen with the Nordic referendum 
on the EU. The dominoes will all fall in the direction in which 
the first domino to be knocked over falls. 
  The newspaper's opinion poll indicates that, if two Nordic 
countries vote for membership, a majority of the citizens of the 
third Nordic country will also support membership. In this kind 
of situation fully 86 percent of the Finns and 64 percent of the 
Swedes would vote for the EU. 
  According to the poll, even a slim majority (52 percent) of 
the Norwegians would rather vote for membership than leave 
Norway alone outside of the EU. 
  If, however, two of the Nordic countries were to vote 
against 
joining the EU, the third would also stay out of it. In such a 
situation 44 percent of the citizens would vote for the EU in 
Finland, 40 percent in Sweden, and 24 percent in Norway. 
  As regards the Finnish poll in particular, a fairly high 
margin for error, which is 4.5 percentage points as concerns, 
for example, the last-mentioned question, lowers the reliability 
of the poll. This means that from 39 to 48.5 percent of the 
Finns who voted would say no to the EU following a negative 
stand on the EU in Sweden and Norway. 
<H5>  Example Set by Norway Would Increase Number of Opponents </H5>
  EU critics demanded that the referenda be held on the same 
day, but they have ended up scheduling them at different times 
in the Nordic countries. The Finns, who most strongly support 
the EU are to vote first, on 16 October. Norway, where 
opposition to the EU is greatest, will be voting last, on 28 
November. 
  If Norway were to vote first, according to the poll, a 
majority in all three countries would vote against the EU.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Businessmen Want Finland To Join </F>
Union"] 
  [Text] [no place-name as published] HS-STT -- The Finnish 
Businessmen's Association (SYKL) feels that it is absolutely 
necessary for Finland to join the European Union [EU]. The SYKL 
executive committee justifies its stand on the grounds that 
without membership Finland will not have enough opportunities to 
participate in making decisions involving common European 
markets. 
  In the SYKL's opinion, Finnish firms will only be able to 
acquire equal competitive status with EU country firms through 
membership. The SYKL believes that membership in the EU would 
also create stability and have a positive effect on Finland's 
image and the country's image on world markets. 
  "The advantages for business activities produced by 
membership will clearly be greater than the disadvantages. 
Staying out of the EU would substantially weaken Finland's 
chances of safely developing its national economy in step with 
the national economies of the EU countries," they say in the 
position paper approved on Tuesday [7 June]. 
  The SYKL also published the results of a poll of member 
company managers' views on the EU. According to the poll, 87 
percent of the SYKL's regional and business sector organization 
and local association chairmen are in favor of Finland's joining 
the EU. Five hundred chairmen were asked the question: "Should 
Finland join or not join the EU on the basis of the results of 
the negotiations between Finland and the EU?" Thirteen percent 
of the respondents took a negative view of membership. 
  Those chairmen who took a positive view of joining argued 
mainly that membership would secure Finland's position in 
western Europe and promote internationalization.

<F P=106> [Report by Bente Egjar Engesland and Hilde Harbo: "A Solid </F>
Yes for the Labor Party Leadership"] 
  [Excerpt] The Labor Party leadership has been given its 
marching orders for European Union [EU] membership. The party's 
national congress said yes by 197 votes to 93. 
  With the national congress decision behind it, the 
leadership 
can now throw itself into the EU battle in earnest. Party 
leader Thorbjorn Jagland will address himself first and foremost 
to the doubters and to social democratic voters. 
  He is also emphasizing strongly that the opponents of the EU 
in the party must be given room to fight for their views: "No 
one should have to work against their own convictions. The work 
in the local party apparatus must be able to reflect the EU view 
that exists locally," he said. 
  Labor Party Youth League leader Trond Giske, who was an 
important exponent of the minority's view at the national 
congress, praised the party leadership's attitude to the no 
side. At the same time he also warned strongly against the link 
made by individual speakers between a yes stance and confidence 
in the government. 
  "It is dangerous to hint that the no people have no 
confidence in the government. The most important thing in the 
debate is what arguments are used, not who is using them. 
Loyalty is not allowing others to make up your mind for you," 
he said. 
  Giske believes that if the internal debate takes such a 
turn, 
things will be reminiscent of: "A Labor voter is a yes voter." 
This slogan from 1972 created much bad blood in the party and 
led to many opponents pulling out of party work. 
  The close of the national congress yesterday was dominated 
by 
several powerful appeals for cohesion in a party that is split 
over the EU question. 
  "Let it be burned into the heads of each individual: We also 
want a strong Labor Party after the referendum," Jagland said. 
He warned against disputes focused on people. Party secretary 
Dag Terje Andersen followed this by condemning party officials 
who voice strong criticism in the media without daring to say 
anything in the party's organs. 
  The Nordic area's role in the EU is a source of conflict on 
the no side in the Labor Party. Prominent member of Social 
Democrats Against the EU -- with Hallvard Bakke and Trond Giske 
at its head -- take the view that a Swedish yes simply makes it 
more important to have a Norway outside the Union. 
Nevertheless, proposals were put forward for changes to the no 
side's resolution that states that "what decision our neighbors 
reach in relation to the EU is something that many are concerned 
with in their evaluation of EU membership and Nordic 
cooperation. Developments among our neighbors should therefore 
be followed closely." Both Giske and Bakke think that the 
formulation is only justified in respect of the doubters. But 
they are aware that several no people in the Labor Party are 
prepared to revise their views if Sweden and Finland say yes. 
  Even if there was a solid yes majority in the Labor Party 
another important EU vote remains for the labor movement. On 22 
September an extraordinary LO [Norwegian Trade Union 
Confederation] congress will discuss the membership issue. LO 
leader Yngve Hagensen, who followed the debate at the congress, 
admitted that outcome among the trade union movement's elected 
representatives is much less certain. 
  "I believe that the prospect is of a pretty even race at the 
congress, but I have a well-founded hope that in the trade union 
movement too there will be an objective debate with respect for 
the views of opponents," Hagensen told AFTENPOSTEN. 
  He said that it is first and foremost the high level of 
unemployment and the large social gulfs in the EU that frighten 
people in the trade union movement. 
  "But these problems are first and foremost the 
responsibility 
of the national states. I believe that in the short term we 
will not have either higher or lower unemployment as a result of 
EU membership. But if we do go in and achieve a breakthrough 
for social democratic policies, unemployment throughout Europe 
could fall in the longer term," Hagensen said. 
  The result of the vote at the Labor Party national congress 
surprised no one. Veterans Thorvald Stoltenberg and Reiulf 
Steen were more in suspense about the outcome of the football 
match against Mexico later that evening. But they said they 
were satisfied with the yes side's 1-0 at the national congress 
and said that they though the debate had been objective, 
tolerant, and good. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Christer Kallstrom: "Fishing War Now Being Waged </F>
at Political Level"] 
  [Text] Oslo -- The fishing war between Norway and Iceland 
continues to become more intense with every day that passes. 
Early yesterday morning Norway's military Coast Guard cut the 
trawl of yet another Icelandic vessel that, according to the 
Norwegian authorities, was fishing illegally in the protection 
zone around Svalbard. 
  Yesterday there were several Icelandic fishing boats fishing 
in the protection zone that stretches 200 nautical miles from 
the coast of Svalbard. When Norwegian Coast Guard vessel Senja 
approached the boats, all but one were able to haul in their 
trawls. The Mar failed to haul in its trawl in time and as a 
result had its trawl cable cut by the Senja. A trawl is worth 
almost 400,000 Finnish markkas. Trawls can as a rule be 
salvaged, but this takes 10 to 12 hours. 
  Lieutenant Captain Arne Simonsen, the Senja's captain, said 
that all safety rules were followed during the action. But the 
Icelandic fishermen do not agree. They claim that there were 
crew members on deck when the cable was cut. Because of the 
tension of the trawl, a cable that is cut can produce a violent 
whiplash effect and sever both the arms and the legs of 
fishermen who happen to be on deck. This also happens now and 
then when cables break. 
  There are now rumors that around 30 Icelandic fishing boats 
are on their way to Svalbard. Four Norwegian Coast Guard 
vessels and an aircraft are closely following what is happening 
in the area. No Icelandic vessel can enter the protection zone 
without being spotted by Norwegian radar. 
  The Norwegians are determined to protect their interests in 
the area with all the means at their disposal. Norway views as 
clearly illegal the Icelandic fishing in the area. If the 
cutting of cables or warning shots do not help, the Norwegian 
Coast Guard could in the end resort to firing on boats fishing 
illegally. 
  The fishing war between Norway and Iceland is now being 
taken 
up at the highest political level in both countries. Icelandic 
Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson describes the 
Norwegian Coast Guard's actions off Svalbard as a danger to life. 
  "On two occasions they have endangered the lives of 
themselves and our fishermen. On Tuesday [21 June] the 
Icelandic Government will decide whether Iceland will take the 
conflict before the International Court in The Hague," Jon 
Baldvin Hannibalsson said. 
  "If Norway invites us to negotiations about fish quotas in 
the Svalbard area I will ask the Icelandic trawlers to withdraw 
from the protection zone," the Icelandic foreign minister said. 
  But the Norwegian side is not interested in starting 
negotiations with Iceland about quotas in the protection zone. 
  "The Icelandic authorities have misunderstood the Svalbard 
Treaty, which 30 countries have signed," Norwegian Foreign 
Minister Bjorn Tore Godal said. 
  "The treaty gives no country the right to fish there. If 
Norway were to give Iceland fishing rights in the protection 
zone we would have to give the countries that have signed the 
treaty the same rights. That is why opening quota negotiations 
with Iceland is not on the agenda." 
  The reason why Icelandic fishermen are sailing to the area 
around Svalbard is that fish stocks around Iceland have 
decreased dramatically in recent years. According to the 
Norwegian authorities, this is because the Icelanders have 
overfished their own waters.

  [Text] Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys will end his 
official visit to Sweden late this afternoon. Our special 
correspondent accompanying the minister, Klara Stejskalova, has 
telephoned this dispatch to us from Stockholm. 
  [Stejskalova] Minister Baudys had another tete-a-tete 
meeting 
with his Swedish counterpart Anders Bjorck shortly before 
midday. This is what Bjorck said about the outcome of this 
meeting: 
  [Begin Bjorck recording in English with superimposed Czech 
translation] I think the signing of the memorandum on mutual 
understanding, which deepens contacts between us, is the most 
important outcome of this visit. Sweden's interest in and 
approach to solving the security situation in Europe is similar 
to those of the Czech Republic. [end recording] 
  [Stejskalova] Like our Republic, Sweden regards the 
resolution of relations with Russia, which have been of some 
concern recently, as the issue of paramount importance at the 
present time. 
  Naturally, the situation in the former Yugoslavia was also 
discussed. The two ministers said jointly that they had found a 
common language. 
  Prior to leaving, the Czech delegation headed by Antonin 
Baudys will meet Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas.

<F P=106> [Article by Helena Sjogren: "Favorites Jump the Gun" -- </F>
introductory paragraphs in boldface as published] 
  [Text] Ingvar Carlsson's policy led Sweden into the 
crisis. Carl Bildt's made it worse and delayed a recovery. 
  Repartee filled the air as the two candidates for prime 
minister met on TV for their first duel in preparation for this 
fall's election. 
  The Social Democrats were accused by Prime Minister Bildt of 
having driven investments, companies, and jobs out of the 
country during the 1980's. Social Democratic Party [SDP] 
Chairman Ingvar Carlsson replied that investments, especially in 
industry, had increased considerably more during his time as 
prime minister than they had under the nonsocialist government. 
  Bildt held up the first page of a February 1991 issue of 
AFTONBLADET carrying the headline "1,000 New Unemployed Every 
Day." 
  "That trend continued in 1992 and 1993. It was a misfortune 
affecting everybody. But now the curves have reversed 
themselves," Bildt claimed as he pedagogically turned the page 
upside down. 
<H5>  Historic Chance </H5>
  "Optimism is beginning to spread throughout society, and we 
have a historic chance for a golden era," he said, presumably 
referring to the next election period under continuing 
nonsocialist rule. 
  His challenger for the job of prime minister acknowledged 
that economic recovery "is now coming, happily enough." 
  "Not even a nonsocialist government can prevent an economic 
recovery," Carlsson joked, eliciting one of the evening's many 
delighted giggles from the audience. 
  But Carlsson emphasized the seriousness of the high level of 
unemployment and promised that the Social Democrats would combat 
it by every possible means, including the investment program 
that the party has proposed. 
  The SDP leader also stressed that with a Social Democratic 
government, more emphasis would be placed on a fair distribution 
of the burden. 
  "High income groups and stockholders must bear their share 
of 
the burden," he said, criticizing the fact that the government 
has lowered taxes for those groups by 25 billion kronor. 
  Bildt called that a misleading picture. The government 
lowered those taxes on the firms in order to create new, 
genuine, and lasting jobs, he explained. 
  "Isn't it fair to have a policy that creates new jobs? How 
can you believe that your policy creates new jobs? The Social 
Democrats' new jobs are just welfare jobs," Bildt said, adding 
that "we can't all work for the AMS [National Labor Market 
Board]." 
  In fact, the most frequently repeated argument in the debate 
was the prime minister's rhetorical question as to whether the 
Social Democrats really thought that "higher corporation taxes 
and punitive taxes on venture capital" would reduce the number 
of unemployed. 
<H5>  Bickering Over Taxes </H5>
  Here Carlsson was at a loss for an answer. For his part, he 
wondered how Bildt could defend the fact that a metalworker's 
taxes had been increased by 6,000 kronor per year while Minister 
of Industry and Energy Per Westerberg had received a tax 
reduction of 6 million kronor per year as a result of the 
government's tax policy. 
  The Moderate Party leader answered that as far as the 
metalworker was concerned, his tax increase was a result of the 
emergency agreement signed with the Social Democrats, and he 
claimed that in Per Westerberg's case, Carlsson was wrong. 
  After the debate, Carlsson questioned whether the minister 
of 
industry and energy had really gotten a tax reduction that big, 
but he promised to verify his statement. 
  Carlsson held out his hand during the debate and suggested 
that Bildt go along with the Social Democratic proposal not to 
change employer payroll taxes into personal taxes under the new 
pension system. 
  He said that in that way, the Moderates could reduce 
marginal 
taxes. But Bildt rejected the proposal. He said it was aimed 
simply at making things easier for the Social Democrats, who 
plan even higher marginal taxes.

  [Text] It is being reported from the UN Headquarters that 
in letters to President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot 
leader Rauf Denktas, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
will stress that the 21 March UN document is the final method to 
implement the confidence-building measures, and will clarify the 
points that were discussed with Denktas last week. This 
information was included in a report from the REUTERS News 
Agency, citing diplomats at the UN Headquarters. According to 
the same report, Butrus-Ghali hopes that his letters will help 
both sides to finally accept the confidence-building measures. 
  The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent reported 
from New York that either Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's 
special representative in Cyprus, or Alternate UN Secretary 
General Marrack Goulding, is expected to convey the letters to 
Kliridhis and Denktas next week. 
  Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the government 
has no official information that the UN secretary general 
intends to send letters to Kliridhis and Denktas.

  [Text] The opening of Nicosia International Airport and 
free passage to the occupied areas is seen as a negative 
prospect by 50 percent of the people, while the opening the 
closed area of Famagusta is seen as positive by 45 percent. 
Generally though, 58 percent of the people favor holding a 
referendum on the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. 
  These findings came to light after a pan-Cypriot public 
opinion poll was carried out by AMER [Agency for Middle East 
Research] between 21 April and 9 May. It was based on a random 
sample of 898 persons 18 years old and over. 
  Eighty-five percent of the people said they had heard 
something about the confidence-building measures, while the rest 
had not heard anything or did not know anything about them. 
  Only 27 percent of the people consider the opening of 
Nicosia 
Airport to be positive. DISI [Democratic Rally] supporters were 
the most positive, as opposed to EDEK [United Democratic Union 
of Cyprus] supporters, who were the most negative, followed by 
AKEL's [Restorative Party of the Working People] supporters. 
  The return of Varosha under UN supervision is considered 
negative by 42 percent of the refugees and by 17 percent of the 
non-refugees. Overall, 36 percent of the people were negative 
and 19 percent said they did not know. 
  Asked whether there should be a referendum for acceptance of 
the confidence-building measures or not, 58 percent of the 
people said they are in favor, while 27 percent said the 
government should decide. 
  Forty-four percent of the people said the 
confidence-building 
measures favor the Turks more than us. Only 16 percent said the 
confidence-building measures will help our side; 24 percent said 
the measures will help both communities; 9 percent said that 
neither community will benefit from the measures; and 8 percent 
said they do not know. 
  The views regarding the UN secretary general's statement, 
that the confidence-building measures will help new generations 
to get to know each other, are divided evenly, as 35 percent 
agree and 35 percent disagree. 
  The financial effects of the implementation of the 
confidence-building measures do not concern Cypriots, as 43 
percent believe that things will remain the same as today, 31 
percent say they do not know what will happen, 17 percent 
believe things will be worse, and only 9 percent said things 
will be better. 
  The provision for free movement of Turkish Cypriots is 
considered the most alarming, as only 21 percent agree to it and 
65 percent disagree. Thirty-seven percent said the 
confidence-building measures should not be accepted, 31 percent 
said they should be accepted and 33 percent did not answer. 
  Thirty-four percent are against a federal solution to the 
conditions discussed today, 33 percent are in favor, and 33 
percent said they do not know or did not answer. 
  Those supporting a federation included 38 percent of DISI 
and 
AKEL supporters, 36 percent of DIKO [Democratic Party], and 16 
percent of EDEK supporters. Against the federation were 46 
percent of EDEK supporters, 40 percent of DIKO, 32 percent of 
DISI and 28 percent of AKEL supporters.

  [Text] Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Interior 
Ministry land registry and cartography officials have determined 
that 3,136 of the 4,638 donums in the closed Maras [Varosha] 
area, which the United Nations in the confidence-building 
measures package want the Greek Cypriots to have access to, 
belong to the Turkish Cypriot Waqf and that Greek Cypriots and 
the British confiscated these properties. 
  Upon the request of the President's Office, the Interior 
Ministry, Magosa [Famagusta] Land Registration Office, and 
Lefkosa [Nicosia] Survey Branch uncovered one by one the Turkish 
Cypriot Waqf properties by examining old Maras land registration 
records. 
  According to information obtained from Halil Giray, Interior 
Ministry Survey Branch director and cartography technical 
expert, the Turkish Cypriot properties in Maras were charted on 
land registration maps on a scale of 1:1000. In works which 
were conducted jointly with the Magosa Land Registry Office and 
Lefkosa Survey Branch, old land registration and cadastral 
records were used to chart Turkish Cypriot Waqf properties to 
land registration maps. 
  It was determined that 3,024 donums of land belonging to the 
Turkish Cypriot Waqf appeared in the land registration records 
as Greek Cypriot properties; 88 donums appeared as belonging to 
the British Defense Ministry; and 24 donums appropriated by the 
Greek Cypriot administration under the name of the Cyprus 
Republic. 
  The Turkish Cypriot experts who examined the land 
registration records starting from 1912 one by one, determined 
that 3,136 of the 4,638 donums in the closed area of Maras, 
belong to Abdullah Pasha Waqf and Lala Mustafa Pasha Waqf. The 
remaining 1,493 donums are properties which are not owned by the 
Wagfs. 
  These important works, which shed light on the Turkish 
Cypriot property situation in Maras, found out that 88 donums of 
land belonging to the Abdullah Pasha Waqf had been registered 
under the name of the British Defense Ministry during 29 May 
1947 and 9 May 1948, and 24 donums were appropriated by the 
Greek Cypriot administration under the name of Cyprus Republic 
during 1972-1974. [all figures as heard]

    [Editorial Report] An article in the 12 June Athens daily I 
KATHIMERINI by the newspaper's correspondent in Berlin, Tasos 
Telloglou, contended that the Greek European Union [EU] 
presidency is considered "successful" by Germany, Greece's 
successor. Despite the Greek embargo against The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] and Greece's referral to the 
European Court of Justice, it is expected that German Minister 
of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel will express his satisfaction to 
Alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos during 
the two men's meeting on 14 June. Relations between them have 
been characterized by "special cordiality," according to 
Telloglou, following the successful negotiations on EU 
enlargement last February and the Ioannina meeting that resulted 
in a successful compromise on minority blocking. This "dramatic 
change," which comes after the German EU representatives stopped 
communicating with Greek officials because of Pangalos' 
well-known "importune" statements, contributed to an 
intervention by Bonn in the FYROM and Albanian issues that was 
more favorable to Greek interests. According to Telloglou, it 
proves that Germany considers its relations with Greece more 
important than its relationship with these two Balkan countries. 
Kinkel "contributed to a more realistic" appraisal of the 
problem of the embargo by adopting the view that this issue 
should not define the entire Greek relationship with the EU. 
Telloglou asserted that Kinkel also perceived that the Greek 
Government would not compromise unless FYROM shows flexibility. 
Germany's understanding would have been impossible had not 
Greece shown the availability and imagination to solve some of 
the problems faced by the EU, Telloglou concluded.

  [Excerpts] The Greek economy's convergence plan, made 
public by National Economy Minister Ioannis Papandoniou, 
provides for a decrease in expenditures and an increase in 
revenues. The plan has entered the process of approval by the 
EU [European Union] Commission. Papandoniou dismissed rumors to 
the contrary and stressed that through the five years of the 
plan, real wages and pensions will experience a positive 
increase. Correspondent Mimi Spiropoulou has the following 
report. 
  [Begin Spiropoulou recording] National Economy Minister 
Ioannis Papandoniou announced the basic directions of the 
amended convergence plan and stressed that the plan includes 
policies that aim for social justice and economic growth, and 
that reflect the economic philosophy of the PASOK [Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement] government. The plan's philosophy provides 
for gradual acceleration of the rate of the GNP [Gross National 
Product] from 1.1 percent this year to 2.6 percent by 1997 and 
3.5 percent by 1999. As is known, the minister stressed, the 
fiscal handling by New Democracy led to surpassing the deficit 
of the state budget by thousands [as heard] of drahmas in 
relation to the goal. That represented an excess of 5 percent 
of the GNP. In general, the convergence plan provides that from 
1996, there will be a clear trend toward decreasing the ratio of 
the public deficit to the GNP. The convergence plan also puts 
emphasis on the fiscal adjustment that will result from an 
increase in revenues and a decrease in expenditures. However, 
the government ruled out the possibility of new taxes. The 
increase of revenues will come from direct and indirect taxes. 
The national economy minister stressed that, regarding new 
hiring in the public sector, there is a commitment for a drastic 
decrease. On the other hand, the limitation on the public 
deficit will be facilitated by the 150 billion drahmas that will 
be available annually from the sale of shares of DEKO [Public 
Firms and Organizations]. The sale of OTE [Greek 
Telecommunications Company] and DEP [Public Petroleum 
Corporation] shares on the stock market is planned for 1994. 
Regarding inflation, the convergence plan aims for a decrease 
by 2.5 percent annually on average, ending with 5.9 percent in 
1999 down from 10.8 percent which is the figure today. [passage 
omitted] [end recording] 
  Former National Economy Minister Stefanos Manos criticized 
the process with which the convergence plan was submitted. 
Furthermore, Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras said at 
Thessaloniki Airport that the convergence plan is an austerity 
program. 
  [Begin recording] [Manos] They [the government] will be 
discussing it with the Europeans and they do not show it to us. 
Today they present it as if they had agreed on it with the 
foreigners. 
  [Samaras] In the next few days we will submit a plan for 
convergence through growth. Without dialogue, the government 
today submitted a convergence plan, unfortunately through 
austerity again. [end recording] 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that the Greek 
economy's convergence plan does not include any surprises, but 
it represents a systematization and confirmation of the already 
implemented fiscal and tax policy. He stressed that there was a 
need to draw up a new convergence plan, because the previous one 
drawn up by New Democracy was impossible to implement and did 
not lead anywhere. The spokesman also said that New Democracy's 
reaction yesterday was unjustified, improvised, contradictory 
and politically motivated. Venizelos said that New Democracy 
should have had the wisdom to wait and study the convergence 
plan before opening wounds for which it is responsible. He 
stressed that it is not enough to say one supports the national 
economy, but it is necessary to put one's plan into effect too.

<F P=106> [Article by Gungor Mengi: "To Be a Prime Minister"] </F>
  [Text] The newspaper reports on the real estate owned by 
the Ciller family in the United States have once again placed 
the question of Prime Minister Ciller's wealth on Turkey's 
agenda. That is unfortunate for Turkey.... Arguments should not 
be based on the wealth of the prime minister, who makes 
important decisions for the country. The people must trust 
Ciller, who has called on them to make sacrifices. However, the 
existing realities make that impossible. 
  The Ciller family owns a shopping center with 30 shops in 
the 
United States. That center has 24 donums of empty land near it. 
She also owns a 120-room hotel, an 18-unit apartment building, 
and a four-bedroom house... 
  Some time ago Ciller described the United States as her 
"second homeland." If the reports on the property she owns in 
that country are true, then the people will believe that the 
United States is her first homeland. How can the people rally 
around such a leader? Ciller has not channeled her savings into 
her own country. However, she has urged the citizens to trust 
her. How can people do so? Will foreign investors not ask her 
why she has urged them to invest in Turkey when she has made 
investments in the United States? Will the local investors not 
ask her why she has urged them to invest in southeastern Turkey 
when she has made investments in the United States? 
  Disclosing the source of its wealth is not the Ciller 
family's only obligation. It also has to transfer its assets to 
Turkey. It has to join its fate with that of the people it 
rules. Otherwise, it is impossible to be a prime minister .

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller; place and </F>
date not specified -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] I am issuing the following statement in order to 
correct certain erroneous information that has appeared in the 
press regarding the assets owned by me and my family. 
  I disclosed all my family's assets to the public in a 
declaration before I became state minister. I was the 
initiator. I wanted everyone to behave in the same manner, 
because I believe those who serve the public should have no 
secrets. I submitted the declaration of assets, organized 
according to Article 22 of Law No. 3628 and in line with 
regulations, to the Turkish Grand National Assembly in the wake 
of my election as deputy. Our assets, which were also announced 
to the press, have not increased during my term as deputy, 
minister, or prime minister. 
  The press items on our family wealth state that we have real 
estate in the United States and that we did not include it in 
our declaration of assets, thus accusing us of keeping them 
secret. The truth of the matter is that these properties were 
purchased GCD, a firm in the United States. Marsan Holding 
Joint-Stock Company is a partner in this firm. We own shares in 
Marsan Holding Joint-Stock Company and we declared this in our 
declaration of assets. For this reason, claims that we are 
hiding our wealth or that we are secretly accumulating wealth 
are false. 
  It is legally impossible to include securities and real 
estate in the possession of GCD -- a company in which Marsan 
Holding owns shares -- in our personal declaration of assets. 
We do not have any shares which we have kept secret from our 
declaration of assets. Our holding shares were declared as they 
are. In addition, in order to acquire shares in GCD, Marsan 
Holding applied to the Treasury and Foreign Trade Under 
Secretariat and informed the concerned authorities during the 
allocated time period. For this reason, it is out of question 
to claim that this information -- already in the state archives 
-- has been kept secret while I was leader of my party or while 
I was prime minister. 
  The following items are significant in the declaration of 
assets submitted in accordance with the statute: Article 8 of 
the statue states that the value of the assets declared should 
be based on their actual value at the time of the declaration. 
As a family, we have declared our assets in accordance with 
their value at the time of our declaration. These are estimated 
values. The declarations were based on the approximate values 
of the assets as though buying or selling were involved. The 
regulations also require this kind of approach. There is no 
difference in my assets from the time I was minister and now, 
apart from the sale of my shares in (Marsow) and 7-11. 
  As for the source of the money sent abroad with the 
participation of GCD: This money was acquired from the sale of 
our shares in (Marsow) and 7-11. Marsan Holding's financial 
assets were acquired from the sale of personal real estate and 
shares which we disposed of before going into politics. In 
addition, when the True Path Party was in the opposition, all 
our companies and personal assets were inspected and nothing 
illegal was found. 
  I have shown great sensitivity regarding my political power 
being exploited during the time I served as minister and now as 
prime minister. For this reason, my husband ended his business 
ventures in order not to give leeway to misunderstandings 
regarding my position. He closed his credit relations with the 
public and private banks in Turkey. I am in politics in order 
to serve. I have no material expectations. God has granted me 
the greatest wealth -- the opportunity to serve the lofty 
Turkish nation. I have consecrated myself to my nation. I am 
here to serve my nation and I am going to work to that end with 
all my force. Undoubtedly, there will be those who would like 
to put obstacles in our way but they will not deter me from the 
road which I deem right. My conscience is clear and I do not 
have any accounts to give to anybody. History shows that those 
who serve their people have been harassed. What can we do? We 
are having our share of this treatment. It is up to our lofty 
nation to judge the situation.

  [Excerpt] Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy 
prime minister, has said that the coalition government is 
implementing the 5 April economic decisions on the one hand, 
while it has started a brand new democratization process on the 
other. Karayalcin visited the Turkish Union of Chambers of 
Architects Engineers and the Turkish Union of Chambers and Stock 
Exchanges today. 
  During his visit to the Turkish Union of Chambers of 
Architects and Engineers, Karayalcin met with Chairman Yavuz 
Onen and other officials. He pointed out that the 
democratization package announced to the public on 18 May 
involves certain changes in the Constitution, but the interparty 
meetings held under Assembly Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk on this 
issue reached a deadlock on Article 24 which concerns 
secularism. Karayalcin stressed that Turkey seriously needs 
domestic peace. 
  [Begin Karayalcin recording] We want to push the issue of 
secularism away from being a point of discord in Turkey. The 
Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP] is determined to end the 
dichotomy of secular versus Muslim which certain circles are 
trying to create. The SDPP believes that this dichotomy does 
not exist in Turkey. It is true that the dichotomy between 
secular and antisecular exists and will continue to exist in 
Turkey. We are very sensitive about this issue. There is no 
conflict between Muslims and secular forces in Turkey, however, 
and we will not allow such conflicts to be created. [end 
recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ankara -- Over 70 deputies who are members of 
various parties act as one with the pro-Islamic Welfare Party 
(RP) regarding Islamic issues, giving the impression that a 
"holy alliance" has been set up in Parliament. 
  The 39 RP deputies along with 39 deputies from the ruling 
coalition partner True Path Party (DYP), 20 deputies from the 
main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP), 13 deputies from the 
Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and 10 deputies from the other 
small parties and independents constitute the biggest obstacle 
to amending the Constitution by behaving like a "holy alliance." 
<H5>  Some Activities of the `Holy Alliance' </H5>
  Twenty deputies from the DYP, ANAP and the RP submitted a 
draft of a proposed law which would ban Constitutional Court 
judges from making public statements. This was done in reaction 
to Constitutional Court Chief Judge Yekta Gungor Ozden's 
pro-secularism statements and speeches. 
  Thirty-nine DYP deputies who favor Shariah issued a joint 
declaration stating that "Shariah aims to exalt human beings." 
The declaration also condemns Ozden for his criticism of 
Shariah. 
  Deputies from the DYP, ANAP and the RP eliminated the 
provision regulating the basic education system from the text of 
the authorization law. Thus preventing the Education Ministry's 
closing down the junior high school section of the Imam-Hatip 
[religious] lycees by raising compulsory basic education from 
five to eight years. 
  Members of the "holy alliance" tried to prevent Education 
Minister Nevzat Ayaz from dismissing high-level 
"pro-Shariah-sectarian" bureaucrats from this ministry. Despite 
intensive pressure, particularly by the "holy alliance" deputies 
within the DYP led by Kocaeli Deputy Ismail Amasyali, Ayaz has 
not changed his mind. 
  DYP Isparta Deputy Ertekin Duruturk with support from "holy 
alliance" deputies is leading a drive to convert Hagia Sophia 
Museum into a mosque. The necessary majority was obtained to 
include debate on the draft of the relevant law which has been 
sitting in the parliamentary commission for one year on the 
parliamentary agenda. 
  DYP Canakkale Deputy Suleyman Ayhan is leading the attempts 
to prepare joint motion regarding the launching of a probe into 
the activities of the Fener Greek Orthodox Patriarchate. 
<H5>  Members of the `Holy Alliance' </H5>
  From time to time the number of deputies from different 
parties who act like a separate party within Parliament and 
whose joint message is to defend Islam increases to around 200. 
This solidarity in Islamic issues puts the parties and their 
leaders into a difficult position. 
  The party executives, however, remain passive, giving 
"political interest" first priority. These parties which are 
backed by the rightist electorate remain silent in the face of 
the deputies who violate party discipline in order to avoid 
giving the impression that they have taken a position against 
Islamic issues. The deputies who are members of the "holy 
alliance" benefit from this silence and thus gain power and step 
up their political activity. 
  The RP within the FYP: Although the DYP usually defends 
liberal philosophy, it houses pro-Islamic deputies who are 
strong enough to establish at least another RP. The names of 
the DYP deputies who act like pro-RP members are: 
  Etem Kelekci, Baki Durmaz, Hayri Dogan, Cemal Oztylan, Omer 
Lutfi Coskun, Haydar Baylaz, Necmi Hosver, Suleyman Ayhan, Nabi 
Sabuncu, Ismail Kose, Mehmet Ozkaya, Handan Ozuberk, Nurettin 
Tokdemir, Ertekin Duruturk, Abdulkerim Dogru, Ismail Amasyali, 
Yahya Uslu, Abdurrezzak Yavuz, Fevzi Sihanlioglu, Alaattin Kurt, 
Selahattin Karademir, Selim Ensarioglu, Mehmet Ozkan, Hasan 
Kilic, Ali Uzun, Edip Bucak, Irfettin Akar, Riza Akcali, Cavit 
Erdemir, Sadik Avundukluoglu, Ayvaz Gokdemir, Mahmut Ozturk, 
Turgut Tekin, Nevzat Yazici, Ismail Karakuyu Haluk Muftuler, 
Koksal Toptan, Ali Yalcin Ogutcan, Sami Sozat and Abdurrahman 
Unlu. 
  The RP within ANAP: There are nearly 20 pro "holy alliance" 
deputies in this party. The names of those who have been 
identified are: 
  Vehbi Dincerler, Oltan Sungurlu, Mehmet Kececiler, Mehmet 
Sagdic, Hasan Cakir, Suleyman Hatinoglu, Edip Safter Gaydali, 
Ali Er, Halit Dumankaya, Alaattin Elmas, Nabi Poyraz, Sukru 
Yurur, Ersin Taranoglu, Adem Yildiz, Cenap Gurpinar, Lutfullah 
Kayalar and Mahmud Orhon. 
  The members of the Peace Unity Party and the Nation Party as 
well as independent Deputies Hasan Mezarci and Abdulmelik Firat 
act together on Islamic issues within the "holy alliance." 
  Today, the pro-"holy alliance" deputies constitute the 
biggest obstacle before the democratization process. 
  The ANAP members of the interparty commission which has been 
set up for making changes in the Constitution back the RP's 
condition that constitutional Article 24, which stipulates that 
a state based on religious principles cannot be advocated, 
should be changed before changes can be made in other articles. 
ANAP also says that it will not support any change without an 
amendment being made in that article.

  [Text] Ankara, June 16 (A.A.) -- The Constitutional Court 
on Wednesday [15 June] rejected a demand by a number of deputies 
against the government's law on authorizing privatization. 
  The court rejection took place by a narrow margin of one 
vote 
(six votes rejected the request and five accepted it). 
  The law in question gives broad powers to the government to 
issue decrees in the force of law to privatize state enterprises. 
  Junior coalition partner Social Democratic Populist Party 
(SHP) Deputy Mumtaz Soysal and his 90 colleagues from various 
political parties had applied a while ago to the Constitutional 
Court to abolish the law, asking for the `stoppage of the 
implementation of the law.' 
  Privatization is one of the main objectives of the coalition 
government led by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and was included 
in the government's economic package on April 5.

  [Text] Ankara--Parliament speaker Husamettin Cindoruk said 
Friday afternoon [17 June] that the 13 deputies from the 
now-defunct Kurdish based Democracy Party (DEP) still retained 
their parliamentary status. 
  After receiving a copy of Thursday's verdict issued by the 
Constitutional Court, Cindoruk told journalists that the 
deputies, who on Wednesday resigned from the DEP in a last 
minute bid to avoid being banned from founding a new party, were 
still members of parliament. 
  His statement coincided with State Security Court chief 
prosecutor Nusret Demiral's claim that at least six of the 
deputies, who have announced they will not return to Turkey, 
were terrorists. 
  "They are terrorists," Demiral said, without referring to 
the 
fact that he was preparing to charge them, like the five 
deputies who were arrested in March, for the opinions they have 
expressed either in writing or verbally. "It is up to them if 
they decide not to return... They are terrorists and we know 
how we'll get them back," he added, noting that Turkey had 
signed international agreements for the extradition of criminals. 
  He also said, however, that until the detailed verdict 
emerged and was published, the deputies would continue to enjoy 
their parliamentary immunity. 
  A lawyer for the DEP told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS the same 
day 
that under normal circumstances it would take some three months 
for such a verdict to be published, but he claimed that since 
the court was under political pressure, the process could be 
speeded up. 
  Legally, he pointed out, Demiral's reference to elected 
members of Parliament as "terrorists" even before they had lost 
their immunity or been in front of a magistrate, was an offence. 
Meanwhile, reaction to the DEP closure started to build up 
throughout the world as well as in Turkey itself. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin said in a statement 
that this development showed how vital it was for an amendment 
of article 84 of the Turkish constitution to be enacted. He 
insisted, however, that he would not comment on a court decision. 
  New Democracy Movement leader Cem Boyner said, on the other 
hand, that the closure of DEP was against the principles of 
justice and that the judicial system shaped according to the 
1992 constitution, which was prepared under a military regime, 
was "too tight for Turkey." Boyner called for major 
constitutional amendments. 
  In a separate statement, Turkish Human Rights Association 
Chairman Akin Birdal said the decision of the court was a 
political one, and branded the verdict as "a blow to freedom of 
opinion." 
  Murat Bozlak, chairman of the People's Democracy Party 
(HADEP), said in his statement that the verdict had shown there 
was no true democracy in Turkey and that the principles of a 
judicial state were not being met. 
  Labor Party press secretary Hacer Nursel Uguz concluded that 
Turkey was basically insisting on "a policy of violence" in its 
search for a solution to the Kurdish problem.

  [Text] Ankara--With the closure of the Democracy Party 
(DEP) and the upcoming eviction of 13 deputies from Parliament, 
the fate of Turkey's politics has fallen into the hands of four 
former DEP members. 
  On Friday [17 June], the DEP's last acting chairman Remzi 
Kartal appealed to his former colleagues from Brussels, calling 
on them too to resign from Parliament. 
  If the four Kurdish-origin deputies agree to Kartal's plea 
in 
order to "avoid being instrumental to the system"--as he put 
it-- Turkey will enter a crucial election period in which 
by-elections to fill vacant seats in Parliament have to held 
within three months. 
  With its ailing economy, political observers say the 
financial burden of an "election economy" in Turkey would be too 
great, and would impose a serious threat for the future of the 
current coalition government. 
  Currently, there are eight seats vacant in Parliament, but 
once the detailed verdict is published in the Official Gazette 
and relayed to the Parliament Speaker, the vacancies will number 
21-- only two short of the number required for by-elections to 
be held. 
  If two more DEP-origin deputies agree to resign immediately, 
as Kartal has called for, they will be playing a major role in 
Turkish politics. 
  The Turkish Parliament has 450 seats shared between the 
ruling True Path Party (DYP), which holds 178 seats, the junior 
coalition Social Democrat Peoples' Party (SHP) with 55 seats, 
the main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) with 100 seats, the 
Welfare Party (39), Republican Peoples Party (18), Nationalist 
Action Party (14), Grand Unity Party (7), Democratic Left Party 
(3), New Party (3), Nation Party (2), with independents holding 
the remaining 10 seats. 
  In order to avoid expulsion from Parliament in the case of a 
party closure, DEP deputies Mehmet Emin Sever (Mus), Muzaffer 
Demir (Mus), Mahmut Uyanik (Diyarbakir) and Mahmut Alinak 
(Sirnak) said earlier they had either resigned from the party or 
were never actually members of it. 
  The Constitution says that any politicians who are members 
of 
a party when a case is launched by the Constitutional Court, 
will lose their parliamentary status and immunity if a closure 
decision is taken. 
  Although Alinak's immunity was lifted earlier he is still in 
prison, he has insisted that he resigned from the party before 
the case was launched. 
  On Thursday, the Court did not remove the parliamentary 
status of these deputies, agreeing that they were not members of 
DEP when the case began. 
  Although DEP executives still argue that they were members, 
they have had little support in this argument and claim that the 
decision not to abolish the parliamentary status of these 
deputies stemmed from the political decision not to force Turkey 
into an election atmosphere.

  [Text] Ankara -- Turkey and Iran once again displayed their 
newly established good relations with the visit by 'Ali Mohammad 
Besharati, the Iranian interior minister. 
  The Iranian delegation enjoyed a warm welcome during their 
visit on June 13-15, and the Turkish press reflected the mutual 
understanding between the two countries. 
  Newspapers and television channels gave wide coverage of the 
visit by the Iranian delegation, and there was no mention of the 
fact that the delegation has not visited the [Ataturk] 
Mausoleum, a source of tension and dispute between the two 
countries. 
  Iran impressed the Turkish public with its stance regarding 
terrorism, particularly the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK). The 
anti-PKK statements made by Iranian officials, coupled with the 
fact that they had handed over a number of terrorists, made a 
favorable impression on Turkish officials. 
  This visit laid a solid foundation for President Suleyman 
Demirel's visit to Iran, which will take place on July 25, a 
Turkish official told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN]. 
  "Iranians were very positive regarding our concerns about 
PKK 
activities in the Turco-Iranian border region. They reassured 
us that they would never condone terrorist activities that 
targeted Turkey. They proved this by handing over to us scores 
of PKK members who had been caught on their soil. Turkey and 
Iran also shared similar views on regional issues. Both sides 
want to improve their mutual relations," one of official said. 
Meanwhile, Turkey has reacted to Iran's concerns on terrorism 
in a similar manner. 
  Asked if Turkey would turn over to Tehran members of the 
Iranian opposition Mojahedin-e Khalq Party detained in Turkey, 
Interior Minister Nahit Mentese said: "We will not allow any 
anti-Iranian activity on Turkish soil. We will not shelter 
anyone who can harm Iran." 
  One Iranian official told TDN that they were delighted with 
Turkey's response. "They assured us that they would prevent 
anti- Iranian activities in Turkey. Time will tell whether 
these guarantees hold true, but we trust in the words of the 
Turkish officials," he noted. 
  Mentese announced that Iran and Turkey would struggle 
against 
terrorism together. "Our agreement covers issues other than the 
PKK," Mentese concluded. 
  Besharati stressed that positive and constructive contacts 
had been made during his visit. 
  "We have no dispute with Turkey," he said. "Our borders are 
closed to Turkey's enemies. There are no members of the 
subversive and separatist PKK on Iranian soil. Turkey does not 
have a closer or more sincere friend in the region than Iran." 
As the Iranian delegation left Turkey for Tehran on Monday [13 
June] morning, Besharati aid: "Turkey and Iran should follow a 
common policy regarding Northern Iraq. We informed Turkish 
officials about our stance and strategy on this issue. During 
our meetings with Turkish officials, we said that Iran supported 
the territorial integrity of Iraq and was opposed to the 
establishment of a Kurdish state in the region." 
<H5>  The Problem of Northern Iraq </H5>
  Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ataman said that the 
terrorist organization has benefited from the instability in 
Northern Iraq. 
  "The Kurdistan Democracy Party (KDP) leader Mas'ud Barzani 
and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani 
held a meeting in Silopi on June 13... During the meeting we 
informed them of Turkey's stance and on the country's views on 
the latest developments in the region," Ataman noted. He said 
that Kurdish leaders were aware of the fact that Turkey 
considered a renewal of the elections in Northern Iraq 
unnecessary. 
  Pointing out that the way to stability in Northern Iraq 
should be sought for in Iraq, Ataman concluded: "This attitude 
was also expressed by the communiques published after the 
meeting of Iran, Turkey, and Syria, and that of Turkey, the 
United States, France and Britain. A dialogue should be created 
between Baghdad and Northern Iraq."

<F P=106> [Report by Hayri Birler] </F>
  [Text] Ankara -- Force commanders as well as Chief of Staff 
General Dogan Gures will tour military units to feel the pulse 
of the rank and file of the Armed Forces before the Supreme 
Military Council meeting in early August where appointments, 
promotions and retirements of leading military personnel will be 
decided. Sources close to the military said similar tours were 
carried out as "inspections" by the inspection and assessment 
departments at various force commands every year before the 
Supreme Military Council meeting but added: "Commanders of the 
forces also participate in some of these inspection tours. But 
things are different this year. The force commanders will make 
nationwide tours. They will visit each and every army corps. 
Such visits in the military mean feeling the pulse. They are 
aimed at feeling the pulse and determining the attitudes of the 
lower echelons of the Armed Forces and if there is any disquiet, 
and it is obvious that people in the rank and file are rather 
unhappy, then to find remedies." 
  The sources said as in all sectors of the society the 
economic and political problems in the country are also being 
discussed in the military units and that particular attention is 
being given to the debate between President Suleyman Demirel, 
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Chief of Staff General Dogan 
Gures on the proposed extension of the term of office of the 
chief of staff for another year. 
  The sources said it was interesting that while the debate 
was 
going on Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said that she wanted the 
current people who are in command of the Armed Forces to remain 
and that it may be desirable from the point of view of national 
interests that these commanders stay on in their posts. They 
said that means the prime minister wants the extension of the 
terms of office of the commanders of the Air Force and Navy who 
are scheduled to be retired in August and that her emphasis is 
not only on the term of office of General Dogan Gures. 
  The sources said if this is the case, then the Air Force and 
Navy chiefs will not retire and thus there will be no vacancy to 
fill among the full generals and admirals in the Air Force and 
the Navy respectively. Thus no rear-admiral or major general 
will be promoted this year as full admiral or general. That in 
return will mean some people will have to be retired as they 
cannot be promoted. 
  The sources said: "The promotions in the military resemble a 
pyramid. If there is a vacancy at the top of the pyramid, then 
you can fill in the stones below with promotions and thus push 
up the peak. If in the Air Force or the Navy the top of the 
pyramid remains blocked then people cannot be promoted and thus 
stones start falling out of the pyramid. Thus people will be 
retired. Once the term of office of a general or admiral is 
extended then they will block the promotion of others below. 
The extension of the term of office of two commanders will 
undoubtedly block the promotion of many others and thus will 
create unease among the rank and file." 
  The sources said the force commanders will conduct their 
"pulse finding tours" of the units all together and display 
unity among themselves. Only Gendarmerie Commander General 
Aydin Ilter will not participate in these tours and will only 
visit his own units. 
  Sources said: "General Ilter's position is clear and will 
not 
be discussed at the Supreme Military Council in August. Only 
the tenures of the chief of staff as well as the Air Force and 
Navy commanders will be completed in August. The Land Forces 
commander will be affected by the appointments because he will 
become the chief of staff if and when General Gures is retired 
so the military council meeting interests him. So the four 
commanders want to act together. The controversial letter 
written by General Gures as well as the land, navy and air force 
commanders to former Land Forces chief Ret. Gen. Muhittin 
Fisunoglu asking him not to stir up trouble after his retirement 
and refrain from actions that will undermine the Armed Forces 
was not signed by Gendarmerie chief Gen. Ilter. The reply 
written by Gen. Fisunoglu to the four commanders is rather 
meaningful. He signs his letter telling the four commanders, `I 
hope in your joint letter you do not reflect mutual interests 
and mutual expectations.'" 
  Sources also said President Suleyman Demirel is monitoring 
the developments closely and added, "The head of state is 
showing the necessary sensitivity over the issue." They said 
President Suleyman Demirel points to the previous decision of 
the Supreme Military Council which rejected the extension of the 
terms of office of generals and admirals at the Gulhane Military 
Medical Academy (GATA) and that he may object to the extension 
of the terms of office of the Navy and Air Force commanders.

<F P=106> [By Ayhan Songar from the "Chat" column: "Friendly </F>
Greece...."] 
  [Text] Yesterday, I discussed Greek claims over the Aegean 
continental shelf. Let us expand the issue now and move south. 
The Greeks are eyeing Cyprus with a hearty appetite and are 
waiting for the day they will get the entire island. The reason 
is that Cyprus is about 80 km away from our southern coast, 
while it is much further away from Greece. Now, if the Greeks 
get the entire island -- and that is what lies behind the plans 
for a so-called federation -- they will consider it a continent 
and thus lay claim to its continental shelf and territorial 
waters. As a result, Turkish ships will not be allowed in the 
sea traffic from the Canakkale Strait to Iskenderun Bay. This 
is the equivalent of strangling someone. 
  The Greeks would not be satisfied if we agreed to a 
federation in Cyprus, if we granted state status to the Fener 
Patriarchate, if we installed church bells in the St. Sophie 
Museum, and if we even gave them Istanbul and Izmir. Little by 
little, they are tightening the circle around us. On one side, 
they are establishing a close friendship with Syria and Egypt 
and trying to form another hostile front against us from the 
south; on the other hand, they are supporting the PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] and trying to get their hands on our 
southeastern borders. Furthermore, they are trying to establish 
a partnership with the Slavic states such as the Russian 
Federation, Bulgaria, and the new Yugoslavia. These states have 
their eyes on us and have demands of their own from us. 
Therefore, they are more than willing to become partners in such 
a hostile front against us. This would leave Turkey totally 
surrounded by a ring of fire, and we would not be able to live 
on our land. 
  Please do not think that this is the script of an adventure 
film or an imaginary fear. It is just another one of the 
developments we have been repeatedly faced with throughout our 
history and from which we managed to extricate ourselves each 
time with God's help. It is not a new development. 
  I always say: Sooner or later, we will find ourselves in a 
confrontation with the Greeks. In fact, Greek foreign policy is 
based on enmity against Turkey and on war between Turkey and 
Greece. They are not afraid to repeat that incessantly. For 
now, they are coping with the issue through Cold War methods and 
diplomacy, because of the imbalance of power between us and 
because they have not yet solved their other foreign policy 
problems. For example, even if they share certain common 
aspects with Greece today, the Bulgarians have always had 
certain demands from that country. Let us not forget the 
incidents at the end of World War II. There is also the case of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
It is still a hot issue. The Greeks are afraid that if they 
ask FYROM "to unite against the common enemy," then FYROM will 
say: "Let us reach agreement on our own problem as well." 
  The imbalance of power between Turkey and Greece is obvious. 
Our population is 10 times greater than that of Greece. Greece 
cannot handle our ground forces. Furthermore, I do not think 
that Greece's big brothers in the West would do much more than 
say to it: "Good for you"; neither do I think they would run 
the risk of a new world war that would start in the Balkans. 
  Besides, from the legal point of view, we would be the right 
side in any Turkish-Greek confrontation. There are several 
logical reasons for that. It would be something like a 
"defensive war." 
  I hope my dear readers will not think that I am a warmonger. 
I am a peaceful person. When you are pushed against a wall, 
however, and people are trying to strangle you, there is nothing 
else you can do. 
  If that happens, how would the fact that both countries are 
NATO members affect the situation? Let us discuss this tomorrow.

  [Excerpts] Violence is still prevailing in Rwanda. The 
forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] have continued 
shelling the barracks of the presidential forces in Kigali. 
[passage omitted] 
  Francoise Walmack met Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Willy 
Claes at noon today. She asked him whether the French decision 
to intervene was not a gaffe, given the reservations and the 
opposition of the RPF. Willy Claes said: 
  [Begin Claes recording] I do not think that it is awkward. I 
understand the reservations that have been expressed, but it 
must be understood that.... [pauses] and I am not going to give 
you an exhaustive list of all the attempts to achieve a 
cease-fire that have failed. Unfortunately, confirmation of 
serial killings--if I may put it this way--is expected every 
day. Someone must indeed take the initiative to try and save 
what can still be saved. France has taken the initiative. 
There are no other candidates, as far as I know. There are no 
others, because we should not underestimate the military risks 
of any operation, even if it is a humanitarian one. I believe 
that the French are only intending to try to rescue civilians in 
danger in a single zone by taking them temporarily outside the 
country to refugee camps, while hoping that--in two months' time 
at the latest--UN soldiers will be in a position to fulfill 
their mandate. They are also hoping that, in the meantime, it 
will be possible to have a cease-fire respected. [end recording] 
[passage omitted] 
  What is the situation on the ground? As we told you in our 
headlines, scenes of violence are still taking place on a daily 
basis. If French troops enter the Rwandan territory, it will be 
through the west, that is, through the Central African Republic 
via Zaire. Massacres are taking place in the west of Rwanda, 
whereas in the south--in Butare--people in a precarious 
situation in makeshift camps still prevail. Nicholas Poincare 
takes stock of the situation in Butare: 
  [Poincare] If French soldiers come to Rwanda, they will 
probably enter through the west. They will come to the country 
of militias, machetes, and killers--in those regions where the 
Tutsi hunt is not over, even though casualties are becoming 
scarce. A humanitarian operation could still save many lives 
here. It would come quite late, a long time after the 
massacres, but there are still thousands of Tutsis in mortal 
danger who are scattered and hidden in many places. There are 
orphans who are grouped together by nuns. There are Hutus 
threatened because they protected Tutsis, while others hide 
simply because they have lost their identity papers and cannot 
prove that they are Hutus. 
  There are also hundreds of thousands of people who are not 
threatened by the massacres, but by famine and disease. They 
are the Hutus who have fled before the RPF. At least 2 million 
of them are believed to be in the south of Rwanda. They live in 
utter poverty, banding together in the hills. In most of these 
unauthorized camps, no humanitarian organization has yet been 
seen.

  [Excerpt] You have heard that Willy Claes spoke about the 
position of Zaire and President Mobutu in the Rwandan conflict. 
The main Zairean opposition party, the Union for Democracy and 
Social Progress [UDPS], has also raised this issue. First, the 
UDPS has strongly condemned the appointment of [Joseph] Kengo Wa 
Dondo as prime minister a few days ago. The UDPS believes that 
this appointment is illegal and points out that Kengo Wa Dondo 
is a former prime minister of President Mobutu's and his name 
has come up several times in files about corruption, a subject 
which has been discussed at the Zairean national conference. 
  Justine Kasavubu, UDPS spokesperson in the Benelux 
countries, 
has especially criticized the role played by France in Central 
Africa, both in Rwanda and Zaire. Jacqueline Pollack [name 
phonetic] asked her what role Belgium could play: 
  [Begin Kasavubu recording] First and foremost, we call on 
Belgium to have much more courage and to be much more ambitious 
for its former colony, and not to yield to France's influence. 
  Moreover, we denounce French policy and we say to all the 
friends of Zaire that they must unite so that the support of the 
French regime for Mobutu and his whole system can be abandoned, 
because we don't understand how a country of freedom can support 
a nazi regime such as Mobutu's. France has economic ambitions 
in Zaire and, among other things, it would like to lay its hand 
on all the wealth of Shaba in order to offset the future South 
African power. Then, in the name of a French-speaking community 
which is badly understood, France would like to establish a new 
kind of imperialism. We denounce the support for a nazi regime 
from a country which styles itself as a country of freedom 
because Mobutu has also carried out ethnic extermination at 
home. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "C.G": "Bonn Prepares To Assume EU Presidency"] </F>
  [Text] The government is preparing to take over the 
presidency of the European Union [EU] for the next six months. 
The cabinet will discuss this subject on Wednesday [22 June], 
and Chancellor Kohl will report on the cabinet's conclusions to 
the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday. Next 
Monday, Swedish Prime Minister Bildt will discuss Sweden's EU 
admission with Kohl in Bonn. Next Wednesday, after the EU 
Council meeting on the Greek island of Corfu, Foreign Minister 
Kinkel will make a government statement to the Bundestag. On 5 
July, the European Commission and German cabinet will hold a 
joint meeting in Bonn. 
  Apart from the prime ministers and foreign ministers of the 
12 EU member countries, the Corfu summit, taking place on Friday 
and Saturday, will also be attended by the prime ministers of 
Austria, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, future members of the EU. 
Government spokesman Vogel confirmed in Bonn on Monday that the 
admission documents to the EU would be signed on Friday. The 
partnership agreement upon between the EU and Russia is also 
supposed to be signed in Corfu, provided that matters concerning 
the translation of the documents have been settled by then. In 
Bonn, it is expected that President Yeltsin will travel to 
Corfu, but, says Vogel, Moscow has not yet confirmed this. 
Vogel said that the EU countries hope to be able to notice an 
economic improvement in the individual countries when making 
their assessment of the general economic situation. They cannot 
come to terms with the continuing structural difficulties there. 
An "interim report" on efforts to safeguard Europe's 
competitiveness and jobs, as set out in EU Commission President 
Delors's white book, is to be presented in Corfu. Germany is in 
favor of an integration of railroads, telecommunications, and 
energy supply lines to form a "trans-European network." But, 
said Vogel, a method of financing that does not threaten 
stability is necessary for this. Competition with private 
suppliers must also be kept intact. 
  Germany and Great Britain have agreed to present a joint 
motion in Corfu aimed at simplifying the multiplicity of 
regulations in the EU. That should serve to simplify 
competition. After initial hesitation, the EU Commission seems 
to have agreed to this motion, said Vogel. Germany will seek to 
expand Europe's systems of training and education. A start 
should finally be made on the reduction of bureaucracy, so that 
small and medium-size enterprises are relieved of unnecessary 
pressure in their work. Bonn views this as a condition for 
Europe's industrial stability and for Japanese and U.S. 
investment. 
  Germany wants to encourage an opening of the European market 
to products from Central and East European countries, with the 
exception of agricultural goods. These countries should be 
given the impression that the EU welcomes them politically and 
psychologically first as partners, and later as as members, said 
Vogel. Germany wants the EU Commission to suggest regular 
meetings of EU heads of government, also attended by the prime 
ministers of East European and Baltic countries. France sees 
Germany as a partner in its calls for greater support for the 
frail countries in the southern Mediterranean. Kinkel and the 
remaining EU foreign ministers want to include in the Corfu 
summit a group of personal assistants to the prime ministers, 
who will subsequently prepare a report to be considered at the 
1996 government conference deciding on institutional reforms. 
In Corfu and at the world economic meeting in Naples in July, 
Kohl and Mitterrand want to reiterate their desire for 
additional funds to safeguard nuclear power stations in the 
East. Finally a resolution condemning xenophobia and racism 
should be adopted in Corfu. 
  Vogel said no personnel decisions are likely to be made in 
Corfu, but the government considers it an urgent matter to reach 
a consensus concerning the next president of the EU Commission 
and other Commission members, because the process of approving 
the newly elected European Parliament will take time; the terms 
of office of the new parliamentary members begin in January. It 
would be good for Germany's EU presidency, beginning on 1 July, 
if the relevant resolutions are passed in Corfu, said Vogel. 
But there are no guarantees of that. It is possible that the 
government will appoint a member of the Christian Democratic 
Union and a representative of the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany to succeed the two German EU Commission members 
Bangemann (Free Democratic Party of Germany) and Schmidhuber 
(Christian Social Union).

<F P=106> [Article by "C.G.": "Concerned About Ukraine"] </F>
  [Text] At a Bonn conference of German ambassadors to the 
CIS countries on the territory of the former Soviet Union, 
considerable concern was expressed over developments in Ukraine. 
Speaking at the close of the conference, Foreign Minister 
Kinkel said that the situation on the Crimea peninsula gave rise 
to anxiety. "It must be clear to everyone that the parties 
concerned must find a solution based on negotiations, a solution 
that will take into account the desire for Crimean autonomy and 
prevent a violent escalation." 
  Kinkel warned Russia: "The territorial integrity of Ukraine 
is an absolute necessity for us and our partners in the European 
Union [EU]." There are doubts in Bonn about whether the 
reformers will succeed in the upcoming presidential elections in 
Kiev. Western states are prepared to provide Ukraine with 
extensive support. However, an impetus for reform must be 
present there. Kinkel described a plan for overhauling the 
nuclear powers plants in Ukraine as "the most pressing problem 
at the present time." It is not, however, certain that the 
European Council meeting on Corfu during the weekend and the G-7 
summit in Naples in July will implement the proposals made by 
Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand. The international 
community must recognize that the growing danger stemming from 
Chernobyl and similar reactors constitutes an exceptional 
threat. Kinkel described contributions to saving the environment 
on the territory of the former Soviet Union as "a key concern in 
German foreign policy." Extensive tracts of land have been 
polluted with radioactivity. There is a danger of natural 
catastrophes that could change the climate in entire regions. 
Kinkel called on German industry to use its technology to 
contribute to preserving the environment. Germany will 
particularly strengthen relations with Russia and Ukraine during 
the German EU presidency. Developments among the states that 
have succeeded the Soviet Union should not become synonymous 
with numerous hotbeds of tension. 
  Kinkel reiterated his rejection of Russia's wish to raise 
the 
status of the CSCE by transforming it into a coordinating agency 
with respect to NATO, the WEU, and the CIS. There is no 
question of subordinating NATO to the CSCE in this form. The 
CSCE has its own important role in promoting democracy and human 
rights, preventing conflicts and providing an early warning 
function, as well as monitoring the implementation of measures 
designed to preserve peace. "It covers a different spectrum 
from NATO and the WEU, but is no less important for the 
preservation of peace and security." Kinkel expressed the hope 
that there would be a growing willingness to reach compromises 
in the relationship between Yeltsin and the Russian Duma.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] According to AFP, certain UN 
military observers in Rwanda have received threats in Kigali. 
They are UN peacekeepers from countries ready to contribute to 
the French intervention. AFP refers in particular to Senegal, 
Togo, and Congo. The UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] 
Command, quoted by AFP, specifies that the departure of these 
soldiers is not planned at the moment, but that they are 
nevertheless asked to be prepared for every eventuality. 
  While waiting for the French resolution on intervention in 
Rwanda to be adopted by the United Nations, probably within the 
next 48 hours, France has already sent a small military 
detachment to eastern Zaire. Christophe Boisbouvier reports: 
  [Boisbouvier] Paris has in fact confirmed that 15 or more 
French soldiers have arrived at the base of Goma, in eastern 
Zaire, very close to the border with Rwanda. It is a forward 
detachment and has the task of checking the runway before any 
wide-bodied aircraft land there. The wide-bodied aircraft could 
then make the shuttle trip between the operational platform of 
Bangui and the base at Goma. 
  On the other hand Paris denies the report from our Belgian 
colleague LE SOIR stating that French soldiers have already 
crossed the border and are at Cyangugu, in the extreme southwest 
of Rwanda, to renovate a runway there. This is untrue, the 
French Defense Ministry states; we will not enter Rwanda until 
the United Nations has given the go-ahead. 
  On the Zairean side, President Mobutu says he is ready to 
facilitate the task of this humanitarian force by lending the 
bases, but specifies that no Zairean troops will be involved. 
This is not appropriate under the current circumstances, he 
says. With regard to the Zairean opposition, Etienne Tshisekedi 
says he is fiercely opposed to this operation. He accuses 
France of attempting to put his old political rival, Mobutu Sese 
Seko, back in the saddle. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin was the 
guest of our colleagues at France Culture [radio station] this 
morning. He responded to the accusations and the opposition 
which, as we have seen, are increasing with regard to this 
French plan for intervention in Rwanda: 
  [Begin Roussin recording] We are intervening because, in 
fact, what we see, what we hear, what we read is intolerable. 
It annoys me to hear France being constantly criticized and 
people pointing a finger at France. We are all involved in this 
business. The government takes the initiative and people still 
point the finger at it. What do you expect us to do? Leave 
things like that? Who is going to take France's place? Who is 
taking the initiative at the moment? Nobody. We are there, we 
are knocking at Europe's door and nobody answers. Nobody in 
Africa has mobilized or has stood up to protest against this 
genocide, even the neighboring countries, and now that we are 
taking the initiative -- well, people can be critical of the 
policy which we have carried out in Rwanda, but in any case we 
are now getting involved to help save lives and we are on our 
own. Even last night, if I heard the latest news correctly, it 
was not a big success at the United Nations. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] That was Michel Roussin, speaking on France 
Culture this morning. The Cooperation Ministry has announced 
that a member of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is in Paris 
today to meet French political officials. As we know, the RPF 
opposes French intervention, while on the government side this 
idea has met with a favorable response. This is what Martin 
Auko Bissaba, Rwandan charge d'affaires in Paris, explained to 
Ghislaine Dupont: 
  [Begin recording] [Bissaba] In view of the situation in 
Rwanda, which is truly catastrophic -- many people have died on 
both sides, in the area controlled by the government and in the 
area controlled by the RPF -- and also in view of the fact that 
the two sides have not been able to reach agreement on halting 
this real human tragedy which is shaking the whole world, well, 
I believe that the French initiative is welcome. 
  [Dupont] Do you not think it would have been desirable for 
this protection force to be organized, made up, just of UN 
peacekeepers, in fact a beefed up UNAMIR force rather than a 
force which will apparently be made up mainly of French troops? 
  [Bissaba] At the moment what we need is a force that can 
stop 
the Rwandan tragedy and, as you will know from following the 
deliberations at the UN, this is taking far too long. As you 
can see, with every minute that passes, more lives are being 
lost in Rwanda, so I believe that as an emergency measure this 
French initiative is really welcome, because if we had to wait 
for the UN procedures to come to an end I think we would have 
wasted a lot of time. 
  [Dupont] France says that this humanitarian protection force 
will give aid to both sides, it will be impartial. Will the 
government forces allow Tutsi refugees who are still in areas 
controlled by them today to be evacuated? 
  [Bissaba] I believe that the Rwandan government in any case 
has given an undertaking that the massacres may be halted in the 
areas it controls [as heard], it gave a firm promise to this 
effect in Tunis, and I believe, and furthermore according to the 
information in my possession, the situation is gradually calming 
down, so I do not see why the Rwandan government would refuse to 
allow the intervention forces to reach the Tutsis. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] That was Martin Auko Bissaba, Rwandan charge 
d'affaires in Paris.

  [Text] Rome, June 21 (AFP) -- Italy favours international 
humanitarian intervention in Rwanda but has no intention of 
taking part in a French-led military mission on a unilateral 
basis, Foreign Minister Antonio Martino said Tuesday [21 June]. 
  Martino told parliament that the government opposes the 
action "the French would have wanted, with or without us," 
because it would constitute a "major factor in the conflict" in 
the Central African country. 
  In Brussels, a diplomatic source had earlier said that Italy 
was prepared, on certain conditions, to send troops to join 
soldiers France wants to send to Rwanda to halt the ethnic 
bloodletting there. 
  The diplomat was speaking after some nations in the Western 
European Union (WEU) had declared readiness following an 
ambassadorial meeting to provide logistic support for the French 
move if it receives backing in a new UN Security Council 
resolution. A draft resolution drawn up by France was on the 
table in New York on Tuesday. 
  Italy was ready to take part in "humanitarian intervention" 
at the initiative of the WEU, the United Nations or the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Martino said, "provided above all 
that the concerned parties agree to it." 
  The mainly Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) 
have warned that they will fight any French intervention because 
they consider that Paris armed the Rwandan army, which in turn 
trained extremist Hutu militias accused of killing hundreds of 
thousands of Tutsis and opposition Hutus. 
  Intervention by "one or two white countries would be 
considered an act of neo-colonialism," Martino said, adding that 
"if we send a contingent now, they will finish up like the 
Belgian soldiers" in a reference to 10 UN peacekeepers massacred 
when the ethnic bloodbath began early in April.
