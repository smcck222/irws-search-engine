<F P=106> [Commentary by "deu": "Green Offer for Scharping's Voters"] </F>
  [Text] After their double-digit success in the European 
elections, the Greens feel so confident about Bundestag 
elections that they would even like to help the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] during the election campaign. 
The best result for the Greens is useless if the Social 
Democrats do not succeed in improving their chances 
considerably. Thus, Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer 
instructed his colleagues at the Laender Council during the 
weekend [25-26 June] to spare the SPD in the next few months. 
  Not so much to please their own supporters but to attract 
Scharping's voters, the Greens are trying to get rid of the last 
elements of their image as a middle-class nightmare. One liter 
of gasoline should only cost five German marks once sufficient 
three-liter cars are available. The withdrawal from NATO has 
been postponed to the distant future, and everything that costs 
money will be calculated carefully. This sounds like an appeal 
to the floating voters of the center parties and seems to be 
addressed to Scharping's supporters: Nobody should any longer 
have to vote for the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union out of fear of a coalition between the SPD and the Greens. 
The message of the Laender Council of the Greens was that by no 
means do the Greens want to be responsible if the Kohl 
government should not be voted out of power on 16 October. 
  The following impression is strengthening: The more the 
Greens orient themselves toward reality, the more social 
democratic their programs become. In practice, the ecological 
party has the task of forcing the SPD to implement its own 
program. For the Greens, the alternative for 16 October is 
clear: Kohl/Kinkel versus Scharping/Fischer, and "continuation 
of the current situation" versus "change."

<F P=106> [Report by Wilhelm Hadler: "Billions for European Transport"] </F>
  [Text] Corfu -- Jacques Delors' White Book on Growth, 
Competitiveness, and Employment continues to be the major 
guideline for the European Union's [EU] economic policy. At the 
summit in Corfu at the weekend, the heads of state and 
government confirmed their view that the growth in production 
achieved up to the turn of the millennium must mainly be used 
for investments and for creating new jobs. 
  The emerging economic recovery must not lessen efforts 
towards achieving structural adjustments. This aim, the 
summit's conclusion statements say, should "be realized in the 
spirit of solidarity and taking particular account of the 
weakest members of society." 
  As expected, the "heads" agreed on a list of 11 priority 
traffic projects that are to be started or completed with the 
EU's support. These include high-speed train connections like 
the planned Brenner Axis, Verona-Munich going on to 
Nuremberg-Erfurt-Leipzig, and Berlin, as well as the western 
connection linking Paris-Brussels-Cologne-Amsterdam-London. The 
EU Commission estimates the required investment at 130 billion 
German marks. 
  The member countries concerned have been asked to start 
immediately all the traffic projects whose preparation has 
progressed far enough and to begin all the others in 1996 at the 
latest. In the course of this, it will also be examined whether 
the "trans-European networks" can be extended to the Central and 
East European countries and the Mediterranean regions. 
  Funding of the networks is to be decided on a case-by-case 
basis. "If necessary, measures will have to be adopted to make 
sure that priority projects do not face financial obstacles that 
might endanger their coming into existence." 
  Should a project be threatened due to insufficient 
profitability, the Council, together with the Commission and the 
European Investment Bank (EIB), will immediately examine 
"suitable solutions" within the EU's financial planning 
possibilities. 
  In the heads of governments' view, the challenges in the 
field of new information and communications technologies must, 
however, be created by private industry alone. But a permanent 
coordination body shall ensure that public and private agencies 
work in the same direction.

<F P=106> [Report by Nigel Collard and Tony Patey: "EU Targets South </F>
Africa"] 
  [Text] High-level trade and finance delegations from 
Brussels and Britain are going to South Africa in the first 
official visits since the Nelson Mandela government came to 
power. 
  They aim to put European Union [EU] trading nations firmly 
in 
the front line in the threecornered fight between Europe, the 
United States and the Far East over access to the resources-rich 
nation. 
  The EU delegation will be made up of representatives from 
several major directorates-general and will be in South Africa 
from 27 June to 2 July. Trade, investment and tariffs are to be 
discussed in depth as part of a comprehensive package earlier 
agreed by the Council of Ministers. 
  Britain's trade and economics group, which will be at least 
60-strong, will be headed by board of trade president Michael 
Heseltine and is believed to be one of the largest delegations 
to leave the UK this year. 
  During the visit -- from 10 to 15 July -- the British group 
will meet business people and politician; in Johannesburg, 
Durban and Cape Town. Britain has already pledged a $150 
million loan the largest amount from any European country. 
  The EU delegation will arrive in Cape Town for talks with 
Trevor Manuel, South Africa's minister for trade and industry 
and other senior ministers, before going on to Pretoria and 
Johannesburg. Apart from wider issues, the talks are crucial 
because South Africa's status as a trading partner and as a 
suitable investment prospect has to be clarified. 
  If firm future trade links are to be set up, a bilateral 
agreement between Brussels and Pretoria is seen as a matter of 
urgency. So far, the EU has left it to member states to enter 
into investment protection, double taxation and bilateral trade 
agreements with South Africa, but has now accelerated the pace 
at which it feels agreement must be reached with South Africa in 
the face of American initiatives. 
  With the total U.S. commitment of $420m in loans towards 
economic and social regeneration in South Africa both from 
public and private sectors, the pledges of $179m this year from 
the EU and member countries apart from the UK may look small in 
comparison. However, EU contributions will be grants, without 
strings attached. 
  In April, the EU foreign affairs council finalised its 
policy 
on a joint trade and aid measures programme and following the 
South African elections, this is a priority issue on the 
delegation menu. 
  The visit is seen as the first of a two-phase thrust to 
establish future relations. The second phase will begin with a 
conference in the EU with delegates from all southern African 
countries. Mandela has already agreed in principle to the 
creation of a Southern African Economic Community and this will 
be actively pursued. 
  The EU wants to prepare the way for other areas of 
cooperation in education and training, industry and commerce, 
telecommunications science and technology.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Antonio Ruberti, EU Commissioner </F>
for education and research, by Gunnar Magnus; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] The EU's [European Union] "minister for research" 
stressed how important it is to develop more environmentally 
friendly technology. He also said that the EU's new emphasis on 
transport research is linked to the goal of an internal market. 
  Italy's Antonio Ruberti is the EU commissioner for education 
and research. He took part recently in the large-scale EUREKA 
[European Research Coordination Agency] conference in 
Lillehammer. 
  EUREKA is the name of the research group which now embraces 
23 countries in Europe and the EU Commission. Projects are 
proposed by cooperating companies in different countries, and it 
is these countries which chiefly finance the research. 
Consequently this research is closely linked to the needs of 
business and industry. 
  The research fro which the EU grants money must from the 
outset have more fundamental implications -- or be ahead of the 
competition on the market, as the phrase goes. The EU's 
research programs have existed for 10 years, EUREKA for nine. 
And, according to Ruberti, the relationship is good: EU 
research and EUREKA complement each other in many ways. Ruberti 
said that the EU is involved in 27 EUREKA projects. 
  At the EUREKA conference Ruberti followed up Norway's strong 
emphasis on environmental issues and more environmentally 
friendly technology. 
  "In its recently adopted fourth framework program for 
research the EU has made strong commitments in this field. 
Environmental research is a separate area of investment, but 
the environment also comes into fields such as energy, 
transport, and biological sciences," he said -- and predicted 
greater cooperation on environmental problems. 
  Several East European countries are now involved in EUREKA. 
Russia attended the Lillehammer meeting with a large delegation. 
Asked what Russian companies have to offer, Ruberti reminded me 
of the country's technological background, particularly in the 
military-industrial complex. The competence built up here can 
be adapted to meet civilian needs. 
  "Russia has a very interesting potential. The fact that the 
country is today experiencing problems does not mean that the 
level of quality is low," he stressed, adding that the Russians 
are very interested in EUREKA cooperation. But so far they have 
not taken part in many projects. 
  The EU gives research support to the countries of East 
Europe 
-- both through a foundation and directly in the form of project 
support. Of a total allocation of ECU540 million (around 4.52 
billion Norwegian kroner) to countries outside the EU, nearly 
one-half go to the countries of East and Central Europe, Ruberti 
said. The money helps to maintain scientific centers which would 
otherwise have been in great difficulties because of the 
economic situation. 
  Through a center set up jointly with Russia, the United 
States, and Japan, the EU is helping in the conversion from the 
military to the civilian sector. The EU has also made money 
available to improve the safety of nuclear reactors in East 
Europe. 
  Recently the Socialist Left Party voiced criticism of this 
project, partly with the argument that, in this way, dangerous 
power stations are being kept in operation. Ruberti's response 
is that it is not the EU which decides whether the reactors 
should be in operation. 
  "We cannot afford to allow ourselves not to worry about 
safety," he added. 
  The EU's fourth framework program for research continues to 
focus on areas of investment from the third program: 
information and communications, biological sciences, the 
environment, industrial technology, energy, and human resources 
and mobility. Two new areas have been added: Social research 
and transport. 
  Ruberti said that transport and information research is 
about 
creating a better flow of goods and information. These fields 
are closely linked to the political goal of achieving a single 
internal market in the EU. 
  The new EU programs for education -- Leonardo and Socrates 
-- 
have not yet been formally adopted. But Ruberti is expecting 
support for them at a forthcoming ministerial meeting. The main 
problem is finding the money, especially since the way is being 
prepared for enlargement. 
  Norway is already deeply involved in research cooperation 
with the EU, in part a as result of the EEA [European Economic 
Area] agreement. But until we become members of the EU, we will 
not be involved in the formal decisionmaking process. Ruberti 
said that Norway can make important contributions in fields like 
environmental research and fisheries research. He praised 
Norway's approach to vocational training and further education. 
  Would an EU no-vote have any impact on cooperation? Not to 
any great extent. But Ruberti cannot rule this out all together 
and pointed to certain problems with Switzerland, which said no 
to the EEA. For the time being at least the relationship between 
Norway and the EU seems to be the very best in the fields of 
education and research.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Further Legal Action Against the </F>
Steel Subsidies Following the Council of Ministers on Steel 
Issues"] 
  [Text] Before the end of this week, the Steel Trade 
Association, together with German and Netherlands companies, 
intends to take legal action at the European Court of Justice in 
Luxembourg against the subsidies for the state-owned Italian 
steel group ILVA. 
  The German Steel Federation yesterday announced that the 
action brought against the EU Commission proposes that the 
decision to authorize 100 billion Luxembourg francs worth of 
subsidies for ILVA be reversed. 
  It was reported that the joint action with Preussag Steel 
AG, 
Thyssen Steel AG and the Netherlands steel company Hoogovens 
B.V. would be submitted this Friday. The Council of Ministers 
approved the subsidies in December at the Commission's proposal. 
The European Independent Steel Producers' Association EISA has 
already brought an action against it, and British Steel and the 
Danish Det Danske Stalvalsevaerk announced such a step. 
<H5>  Dark Veil </H5>
  The Steel Federation and companies argued in their action 
that the massive subsidy was causing severe damage to the 
private steel companies in all the EU states. The subsidies 
were unlawful, because they were not consistent with the Steel 
Subsidies Code. According to the plaintiffs, there was no room 
for an exemption. The Commission had not asked favored 
companies for a sufficient commitment in return in the form of a 
production capacity reduction. 
  The Steel Trade Association welcomed the fact that the 
Council of Ministers on steel issues has not given any general 
authorization for subsidies on Wednesday in Luxembourg. The 
German Steel Federation declared that "a close examination of 
the individual cases is required before further subsidies are 
authorized." Until now, they had been cloaked in a thick veil.

<F P=106> [Report by Bjorn Lindahl: "Meeting in Oslo Unites </F>
Yes-Sayers"] 
  [Text] Oslo -- The Nordic organizations working for a yes 
to the EU [European Union] gathered in Oslo yesterday for a 
strategy meeting. A 10-point plan was put forward outlining how 
the Nordic area can influence the EU if Sweden, Norway, and 
Finland become members. 
  According to the yes-organizations it is chiefly on women's 
and environmental issues and in the field of labor market policy 
that the Nordic area can make a positive contribution to the EU. 
  "We are entering an EU where there are many men with gray 
hair and gray suits. But this was also the situation in the 
Nordic area 25 years ago. This is simply a new challenge. All 
organizations working for equality inside the EU welcome the 
Nordic countries," said Ines Uusman, who leads Sweden's Social 
Democrats for the EU. 
  The 10 points are of necessity pretty woolly in their 
formulation, since the yes-organizations attract voters from 
many different parties and countries. 
  There is also a big difference for the yes-side in Finland 
where they have a majority of 48 percent for the EU against 32 
percent against in the polls, compared with Sweden and Norway 
where the no-side has the upper hand. 
  "But there are also big differences between Sweden and 
Norway," Carl Hamilton, chairman of "Yes to Europe," pointed 
out. "In Norway people have already entered the trenches, while 
Swedes will reply `don't know' or have a weak preference in one 
direction or the other." 
  Therefore influencing public opinion in Sweden is easier. 
According to Hamilton, another difference is that fact that in 
Sweden there are no credible leaders on the no-side. 
  "The only political parties saying no are the Green Ecology 
Party and the Left Party which both have fairly unusual leaders." 
  In Norway Center Party leader Anne Enger Lahnstein has been 
proclaimed "no-queen." But the Socialist Left Party has also 
begun to move in recent opinion polls and has topped 10 percent. 
With its 140,000 members, "No to the EU" is bigger than any 
political party. 
  Kalevi Sorsa, who leads the organization called "A Better 
Alternative -- Finland in Europe," pointed out that the Finns 
attach greater importance to security policy and see the EU as a 
more secure alternative to the country's standing alone. 
  For the other yes-organizations people's fears of losing 
their prosperity, equality, and jobs are what are being 
mentioned most often as the biggest challenge to overcome. 
  "The voters are used to the fact that the political 
situation 
in Europe has been stable, and it has been most stable in the 
Nordic area. Now we are part of a Europe in turbulence, and 
there are many people who want to withdraw. Political nostalgia 
is flourishing, but it is our common task to explain that we 
have to go on the offensive to meet this," said Inge Lonning, 
who leads the Norwegian Europe Movement. 
  "The real world is chaotic and turbulent. Joint Nordic 
membership of the EU will have an influence and is the 
alternative which will give the greatest security," Inge Lonning 
said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino by </F>
Mario Tedeschini Lalli in Rome; date not given: "Immigrants Are 
Welcome, They Make Italy Wealthier"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Lalli] Mr. Minister, 
you have stated that the EU's [European Union] decision [on 
tightening immigration regulations] was "an egoistic choice from 
an ethical viewpoint, and a mistaken one from an economic 
viewpoint." Within the majority, opinions differ from your 
own.... 
  [Martino] I said what I believed. I have been saying what I 
believe for the past 51 years, and I am not going to change now. 
  [Lalli] Your position seems closer to the Left than to the 
opinions that a member of the present government would be 
expected to hold. 
  [Martino] Well, you know...(Martino smiled -- LA REPUBBLICA 
editor's note) this sort of thing happens when you think with 
your own head. You may then find yourself closer to others than 
to your own natural friends. 
  [Lalli] However, what are the grounds for this, so to speak, 
"extreme liberalist" position? 
  [Martino] To begin with, let us draw a difference in our 
minds between two very different issues. When I speak of 
immigration, I am referring to the opportunity for people to 
find work in other countries than the one where they were born. 
This issue must not be confused with that of foreigners who 
come here without a job, as tramps, or who carry out activities 
which are possibly illegal. This is not the problem we are 
referring to. This is a law-and-order problem which concerns 
foreigners, and Italians too. I believe that, if we manage to 
keep the two issues distinct -- the law-and-order problem 
concerning vagrancy, and the other problem -- as regards 
immigration, we can follow a less egoistic policy than the one 
suggested by the EU. 
  [Lalli] Why is this? 
  [Martino] First, for an ideal reason. I believe that if you 
believe in freedom, this must include the freedom to move. The 
fact that I may wish to live in another country forms part of my 
freedom to move. Secondly, on economic grounds. Migration has 
been a major factor in the production of wealth. Milton 
Friedman (the ultraliberal economist who led the "Chicago 
school" -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) said: "Every immigrant 
brings along a mouth to feed, but also two arms." That is to 
say, he contributes more to production than to consumption. 
Today, speaking at a Senate commission meeting, I again 
recalled the fact that, in 1870, Australia was an empty 
continent with the highest per capita income in the world. The 
United States was also an empty continent. From 1870 to 1926 
the United States followed an open door policy, whereas 
Australia followed a selective immigration policy. Australia 
remained an empty continent, whereas the United States become a 
world power. In short, immigration is a factor contributing to 
a country's wealth. The greatest resource consists of men and 
their skills. Immigrants -- when they have a regular job, and 
so on -- make the country wealthier, contribute to its wealth. 
  [Lalli] What is your reply to your allies in government who 
are saying that, on the contrary, immigrants steal jobs from 
Italians? 
  [Martino] I reply that all the available sociological 
investigations show that these two groups of workers look for 
jobs in completely different markets, there is no competition 
between foreign workers and Italian workers. The typical 
immigrant's profile is that of a worker with few formal 
qualifications, whereas the typical unemployed person is highly 
qualified. 
  [Lalli] What should the Italian Government be doing to 
tackle 
this problem? 
  [Martino] I believe that the Martelli law [on immigration] 
must be reviewed, that a distinction must be drawn between 
illegal immigrants entering the country without a job (and 
sometimes giving rise to problems which people rightly deplore), 
and immigrants coming here to work, and I believe that 
foreigners who wish and manage to get a job in Italy ought to be 
allowed in. 
  [Lalli] Even though this may involve according them a 
different treatment as regards social security benefits? 
  [Martino] You see, the problem is the following: If we 
establish the same type of treatment for these workers, we will 
in fact be preventing many of them from finding work in Italy.

  [Text] Luxembourg -- [Interior] Minister Maroni, together 
with his colleague [Justice Minister] Biondi, has just signed an 
EC resolution that closes the doors of Europe to non-EC 
citizens. He explains what repercussions the EC directive will 
have on our regulations. 
  [Coffaro] Italy will have to conform. Will you be the one, 
upon your return to Rome, to propose the necessary modifications 
to the Martelli law [on immigration]? 
  [Maroni] No, the Martelli law entailed a thousand 
difficulties and a thousand controversies. Therefore, the last 
thing that the government must do is to change it by authority. 
I will limit myself to telling the ministers and parliament 
what has happened. Of course, I will stick to what the two 
houses decide, but I will take no initiative. This resolution 
constitutes a political affirmation of principle, but it is not 
legally binding. It is not a directive. Italy, therefore, is 
not obliged to change its laws. 
  [Coffaro] But other laws could be changed judging by the 
controversies over Article 41 and that on criminals who 
collaborate with the judicial authorities. 
  [Maroni] The government has no intention of changing Article 
41, which provides for severe terms of imprisonment for Mafia 
bosses, nor that on those who collaborate with the judicial 
authorities. 
  [Coffaro] And what if the study group on Article 41 and on 
those who collaborate with the judicial authorities ares of 
different opinions? 
  [Maroni] By mid-July I will receive the conclusions 
concerning possible changes from a mixed study group consisting 
of representatives from the magistrature, the Interior Ministry, 
and the Justice Ministry. These, however, will be modifications 
to the regulations, there is no need for a new law on how to 
treat those who collaborate with the judicial authorities to 
improve protection. Moreover, I will remain firm on Article 41. 
This government will not diminish its fight against the Mafia, 
rather it will intensify and improve it. 
  [Coffaro] How did your European debut go? 
  [Maroni] Well, I would say, perhaps I am lucky. Just today I 
was congratulated by the American Vice Attorney General on the 
Teledrug accord with Russia, and here in Luxembourg we succeeded 
in launching the operations of the Europol Community police. 
For the time being it will principally be involved in the fight 
against drugs, but it is also an embryo around which the 
structure of the future European FBI will grow. On 20 and 21 
September I will be in Washington to define the terms of 
increased collaboration among Europe, Italy, and the United 
States. In exchange for the information that Italy will receive 
from Russia in the fight against the Mafia drug traffickers of 
the East within the framework of Teledrug, the Americans will 
provide us with the news they receive from Colombia. 
  [Coffaro] But Europol is starting off with the rejection of 
an Italian candidate at its head? 
  [Maroni] As envisaged, the director of Europol will be the 
German Juergen Storbeck, who was involved from the very 
beginning. The two deputy coordinators will be the Belgian 
Willie Bruggeman, Storbeck's right-hand man, and the 
Luxembourger George Rauchs. I had maintained that an Italian 
should be at the head of an institution that fights against drug 
trafficking, particularly Deputy Head of Police Emanuele 
Marotta, an expert from the Central Antidrug Service. The drug 
trade is one of the businesses that the Mafia deals in at 
international level and who knows the Mafia better than an 
Italian policeman? It is not a matter of nationalism. However, 
I have been told that Bruggeman will be at Storbeck's side only 
until the end of the year. 
  [Coffaro] The national anti-Mafia district attorney Siclari 
has said that the Mafia used last year's attacks in Via Fauro, 
Florence, and Milan to launch a request to attenuate the 
severity of Article 41 and to request a different treatment for 
those who collaborate with the authorities. In addition he 
spoke of an alarm attack. Do you confirm this? 
  [Maroni] I share Siclari's opinion. Perhaps the Mafia wanted 
to launch a terrorist message to modify Article 41 and the law 
concerning the treatment reserved for those who collaborate with 
the judicial authorities. I have said and repeated that these 
two institutes are not under discussion.

  [Text] Bordeaux, France, June 27 (AFP) -- French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe said Monday [27 June] that France's 
military intervention in Rwanda had attained its first objective 
by restoring security to threatened people. 
  Juppe, who is attending a seminar here on the devaluation of 
the CFA franc earlier this year, said the "first objective of 
Operation Turquoise in Rwanda has already been attained because 
we have reassured threatened populations and restored security 
to threatened populations." 
  The foreign minister said opposition to the French operation 
was waning, in particular that of the Tutsi-dominated rebel 
movement, Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), "because we explained 
that our objectives were exclusively humanitarian." 
  Juppe also said the international community was mobilising 
in 
support of Operation Turquoise. "Most of our European partners 
are with us," Juppe said, referring to European Union support 
given at last week's summit in Corfu, Greece. 
  "The priority is to ensure that United Nations troops are on 
the ground as soon as possible," Juppe said. 
  In Paris, assistant chief of staff General Raymond Germanos 
said Monday that French troop strength between the two staging 
posts of Goma and Bukavu, in Zaire on the Rwandan border, would 
be up to 1,300 men by Monday evening. 
  Germanos said no incidents had been reported, but that the 
troops had noted tensions when they made forays into western 
Rwanda. "People are frightened and don't always show it," 
Germanos said, "The atmosphere is very tense." 
  The town of Kibuye on the shores of Lake Kivu was the main 
seat of inter-ethnic tension between Tutsis and members of the 
majority Hutu tribe, another military source said. 
  The source said several hundred Tutsis had taken refuge 
around the town under the protection of nuns and were being 
threatened by Hutu extremists. 
  Germanos said the French force was being progressively 
expanded to its full strength of 2,500, and would reach 1,300 by 
Monday evening compared with 1,150 on Sunday. 
  Operation Turquoise was delayed in its early stages by the 
inability of 25 chartered Russian-built Antonov transport planes 
to land at Goma airport, which has only one runway and no modern 
equipment, Germanos said, but now the Antonovs were landing 
there normally. 
  He added that two field hospitals were being set up near 
Goma 
and Bukavu and that an operating theatre would be established at 
another site. 
  Meanwhile, in Libreville, Gabon, a central African economic 
cooperation group declared "full support" for the French 
operation. 
  The general secretariat of the Economic Community of Central 
African States (CEEAC), one of whose 10 members is Rwanda, 
called on members to send either troops or food and medical aid. 
  Other members of the CEEAC are Burundi, Cameroun, the 
Central 
African Republic, Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome, 
Chad, and Zaire.

  [Excerpts] There may be a new element in the inquiry into 
the attack in which the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi lost 
their lives on 6 April. LE MONDE has revealed that former 
Captain Barril, the former commander of the GIGN [National 
Gendarmerie Intervention Unit] is reported to have the black box 
from the Rwandan presidential plane. [passage omitted] 
  The French foreign minister is not aware of the existence of 
this black box. This is what he said this evening to our 
colleagues at Europe Numero 1: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] I do not know where the black box 
is. 
Like you, I read LE MONDE this evening, and I discovered this 
piece of news. You pointed out that the attack in which 
President Habyarimana lost his life took place on 6 April. On 7 
April, that is, the following day, I ordered France's permanent 
representative at the United Nations to call for an 
international inquiry into the circumstances of President 
Habyarimana's death. On our initiative, the Security Council 
asked the UN secretary general to start an inquiry into the 
attack. The French Government was at no time informed of any 
private initiative to start an inquiry into the circumstances of 
this tragedy, nor, of course, was it informed about the results 
of such an inquiry. [end recording] 
  To round off the story about this black box, it must be 
pointed out that the company which used to carry out the 
maintenance of the Rwandan president's plane have said that they 
never saw any black box on that plane in the course of yearly 
service.

<F P=106> [Article by Henri Vernet: "Two Months Ago, the French Left </F>
Kigali, Why Are They Returning Now?"] 
  [Text] Everyone is aware that an intervention, if not as 
hazardous as some would have us believe, will be far from a mere 
formality: The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which now 
controls almost the whole country, has clearly threatened to 
treat French soldiers as "enemies." On a political level, 
things are just as volatile, as the RPF's many international 
backers (among others, English-speaking African countries and, 
in Europe, the Belgians) will no doubt charge Paris with 
"rescuing the perpetrators of the genocide" by saving the 
supporters of the late [President] Habyarimana's regime from 
certain defeat. 
  In short, the feeling elicited by France's sudden 
interventionism or, more to the point, the determination of the 
occasional Mitterrand-Juppe tandem, however laudable it may seem 
from a "moral" point of view, is one of bafflement. All the 
more when one recalls how frantically the staff of the French 
Embassy in Kigali scrambled to leave two month ago. "A 
veritable exodus," as put by one observer, who still cannot 
fathom why our diplomats should have felt the need to burn their 
files, "as though it were the Germans invading Paris!" 
  What shameful deeds did the French need to bury? And could 
it be that they are now acting on a desire to make amends? 
While the very nature of such a hypothesis makes it difficult 
to ascertain, it cannot be dismissed out of hand. Having 
supported Habyarimana's dictatorial regime (whose exactions 
against the Tutsi minority as well as democratic-minded Hutus 
has been amply confirmed) for years, France was obviously 
instrumental in bringing about today's tragedy. 
  Whatever the Elysee [office of the president], the Quai 
d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry], and the Cooperation Ministry may say 
about the "pivotal role" of our diplomats in the Arusha 
reconciliation agreement signed in August 1993, there are facts 
that will not go away. Until he was assassinated, more than 
eight months after Arusha, Juvenal Habyarimana consistently 
attempted to block the implementation of the agreement. A ploy 
to weaken his rivals, a prime example being the RPF, had been 
successful: The president and his aides had cunningly favored, 
in almost every region of the country, the emergence of tiny 
political parties, all of which had their own demands, thus 
making any national dialogue a very sensitive matter. According 
to regional experts, this strategy had obviously been 
"masterminded by French advisers." 
  Denounced by both national and foreign media for weeks, 
France is now allegedly trying to improve its standing through 
humanitarian action. Here, another explanation springs to mind. 
The U.S. experience in Somalia (that is, before operation 
"Restore Hope" degenerated into tragic surrealism) shows that 
humanitarian action works wonders on a country's public opinion. 
Especially when the latter, as has been the case with Rwanda 
for several weeks now, has been fed a steady diet of unbearable 
pictures and mind-boggling casualty figures. 
  The case for such an explanation becomes even stronger in 
the 
light of an internal strife which has been going on in France: 
[former Humanitarian Minister] Bernard Kouchner went to Rwanda 
several times -- not ineffectively since his indignant calls did 
shake up many a slumbering conscience in France. On the 
government side, while Health Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy did 
visit border refugee camps once, the government had long kept a 
low profile (need one mention the nonentity that is Kouchner's 
successor as humanitarian minister: Lucette Michaux-Blazy?). 
According to Pierre-Marie Decoudras, a Black Africa Study 
Center (CEAN) researcher, the "Kouchner syndrome has obviously 
had a lot to do with" Alain Juppe's gung-ho stance. 
  It also influenced Francois Mitterrand's stance, although an 
additional motive for the latter is likely to be the close 
friendship he maintained with Rwanda's assassinated president, 
with whom Mr. Mitterrand's son Jean-Christophe was close as 
well. Indeed, it was because of such "loyalty" that 
Habyarimana's widow and her family were flown away in one of the 
first Transall transport aircraft used to evacuate French 
nationals from Kigali after the more fanatical Hutus started the 
slaughter. 
  "The other, more traditional syndrome to be considered is 
the 
`Fachoda syndrome' [location in Upper Volta which was ceded to 
the British in 1899]," adds Pierre-Marie Decoudras. In this 
region of Africa, countries such as Rwanda, Burundi, the Central 
African Republic, and Zaire are on the edge of the Anglo-Saxon 
sphere of influence, a prominent member of the latter being 
Uganda, which has traditionally and overtly supported the RPF 
rebels. And at a time when Zaire is being undermined from 
within and the political situation in Bangui [Central African 
Republic] -- the very pivot of French military operations in 
Africa -- appears shaky, France is bent on salvaging what 
remains to be salvaged in Rwanda, and therefore also in 
neighboring Burundi, another country which has always straddled 
the fence. Furthermore, all this should not be too difficult to 
achieve after all. "Remember the small number of French 
soldiers it took to stop the RPF's offensive against Kigali one 
and a half year ago," Decoudras points out. "Things have not 
changed all that much since, and I believe that the RPF and the 
French will necessarily need to compromise. All told, this 
should indeed be a successful military and humanitarian 
operation." In other words, not such a bad deal for France, 
whose latest noteworthy action in Africa was the devaluation of 
the CFA [African Financial Community] franc, and which therefore 
could use the goodwill its "benevolent" intervention might earn 
it.

<F P=106> [Article by Patrick de Saint-Exupery: "Rwanda: France Let </F>
Down by Africa"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Despite the many arguments 
invoked by the Elysee [office of the president], it is now 
obvious that the policy pursued by the highest state bodies from 
1990 to the beginning of 1993 has resulted in complete failure. 
This failure was not intended (it is difficult to accuse the 
head of state of being "guilty of association with criminals," 
as Jean Carbonara, joint author of a damning report on the 
Rwandan "death squads," did), but it bears witness to the 
failure of a "particular" African policy. 
  To understand this clearly, it is necessary to go back to 
1990. Africa was then part of the head of state's "preserve." 
In the Elysee, an "Africa group" advises and guides Francois 
Mitterrand's decisions. Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, his 
father's son, headed that body, which virtually has 
decisionmaking power without any outside control. He was helped 
by Gilles Vidal. 
  Jean-Christophe Mitterrand scarcely has any diplomatic 
experience. A former AFP journalist in Lome, he was appointed 
almost by "imperial fiat." There is no dispute about that. 
Many "scandals" were to characterize the term which 
Jean-Christophe Mitterrand and Gilles Vidal spent at the head of 
the presidency's Africa group. The most recent ones took place 
in the Ivory Coast (speculation in cocoa and coffee) and in 
Liberia (games of influence and money with the mineral resources 
of that country ravaged by war). 
  When war broke out in Rwanda in 1990, Jean-Christophe 
Mitterrand and Gilles Vidal obviously had ringside seats. The 
Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry], disqualified by the presidency, 
does not have any African policy. The presidency immediately 
reacted to the "invasion" of the rebels: the RPF [Rwandan 
Patriotic Front] soldiers who came from Uganda were presented as 
the "Khmers Rouges" of Africa. Paris had clearly designated an 
"enemy," a word regularly heard at the time in military and 
diplomatic circles. On the basis of this position of principle, 
Paris sided with the Rwandan Government led by President Juvenal 
Habyarimana. Not without arguments, but unconditionally. The 
French soldiers, sent in October 1990 to bring out the foreign 
nationals, remained there while the Belgian soldiers, once the 
operation was over, returned home. In the name of defense 
agreements signed between the two states, Paris provided 
logistical support and instructors for the Rwandan Army. 
  No dialogue was opened with the rebels: Are they not 
France's "enemies?" "The Fachoda [place in Upper Volta which 
was ceded to the British in 1899] complex, the view of French 
speakers against English speakers, the statements about the RPF 
-- the Khmers Noirs of Africa, our enemies... That is all 
true!" a very highly placed source now admits. 
  In January 1991, in other words, after four months of 
uninterrupted French military presence in Rwanda, President 
Francois Mitterrand sent a letter to the Rwandan head of state. 
Dated 30 January 1991, this letter provides a framework for the 
French doctrine. Declaring himself to be "profoundly disturbed 
by the harmful consequences which the continuation of 
destabilizing military action could have for peace in the 
region," Francois Mitterrand stated that this "conflict can only 
find a lasting solution through a negotiated settlement and 
general cooperation." He put forward three conditions and added, 
for President Habyarimana's benefit: "In light of the 
difficulties being experienced by your country, I would like to 
assure you once again of France's support." 
<H5>  Arms Supplies </H5>
  Things are clear: Francois Mitterrand talks of "support." A 
very highly placed source admits that the first arms supplies 
then started: "In 1991, France supplied the Rwandan state with 
7 million francs [Fr] worth of military equipment. In 1992, we 
supplied the equivalent of Fr14 million worth. In 1993, Fr7 
million worth." In other words arms worth a total of Fr28 
million. The latest supplies date back to February 1993. "It 
is true that in February 1992, we supplied a large amount," this 
official, who has access to all the documents, admitted. 
  Jean-Christophe Mitterrand did not remain inactive. He made 
many trips to the region: "He tried," it is now being said, "to 
establish contact with the RPF." The initial line of support 
for the Rwandan Government, hastily established, was 
strengthened as time went by. The French soldiers who remained 
on the spot were also affected by this increasingly hostile 
attitude toward the RPF: "The military," it is admitted, "made 
Rwanda a personal cause." 
  This is understandable: Sent by the political authorities in 
the framework of a support mission for an army, the French 
soldiers, by dint of their proximity to the Rwandan Army and the 
fact that they were training it, eventually established friendly 
relations. More seriously: French diplomacy, largely informed 
by the military, bowed to them and repeated what they said 
without any reservations: For instance, one diplomat abroad 
stated in 1992 that the massacres allegedly perpetrated by the 
government militias were mere "rumors." 
  In August 1991, the first contacts were established between 
the Elysee and the RPF. It had taken 11 months. In July 1992, 
real talks started. But the French parliamentary elections were 
approaching, and defeat was looming: It was necessary to 
protect the rear. Jean-Christophe Mitterrand left the Elysee's 
Africa group. He was "appointed" to an important position in a 
big French company and regularly visits Africa. Gilles Vidal, 
his deputy, was appointed ambassador to Cameroon, to the great 
displeasure of "career" diplomats. 
  The new heads of the Elysee Africa group -- Bruno Delaye and 
Dominique Pin -- took over the issue in July 1992. The policy 
originally decided was continued. Even now, in its official 
chronology, the Elysee, referring to the RPF, talks of 
"inkotanyi," in other words, "cockroaches" in Kynyarwanda. 
However, slight but important changes were made by the new 
team. Witness the letter sent on 28 August 1993 by RPF 
President Alexis Kanyarengwe to Francois Mitterrand: The RPF, 
the rebel leader writes, "thanks" France for the "role of 
observer it has played during our negotiations." As proof that 
it was a reconciliation, the RPF president took the precaution 
of adding: "France and the RPF have not always shared the same 
viewpoint with regard to the French Government's position on 
this conflict." That is an understatement. 
  Especially because mistakes were building up. At the 
beginning of 1993, the International Human Rights Federation 
published a damning inquiry report on the Rwandan regime. The 
leaders of the death squads in the pay of the regime were named, 
and it spoke of the first signs of a genocide. The Rwandan head 
of state was criticized by name. The report reached the Elysee. 
However, the authorities took no account of it. 
  In fall 1993, Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana was 
received in Paris by Francois Mitterrand. It was an official 
visit with a red carpet and guard of honor. Did Francois 
Mitterrand then discuss the problems raised by the report on the 
death squads published at the beginning of that same year of 
1993? "Yes," the Elysee now says. One official relates: "The 
president said to the Rwandan head of state: `Iniquities, 
unacceptable things have come to my attention. I know that you 
are heading a country at war but...' The Rwandan president then 
replied to Francois Mitterrand: `Yes, I know about this, but I 
am not responsible. There are extremists. I have called for 
investigations. Those guilty of iniquities will be prosecuted 
before the courts." 
<H5>  Franco-African Family </H5>
  No condemnation was ever pronounced by a Rwandan court. At a 
meeting in Kigali six months ago, Mr. Nkubitu, the capital's 
public prosecutor, said: "The tragedy in this country is that 
everybody knows who is guilty and no official has ever been 
brought before the courts. In our country, there is no 
justice." Last April, at the start of the "genocide," Mr. 
Nkubitu was able to flee Kigali in incredible circumstances: He 
hid in a sack of potatoes. He is now living in exile in Belgium. 
  It is the presidency which provided a final document for the 
file: a letter sent by Francois Mitterrand to U.S. President 
Bill Clinton on 27 September. Reaffirming the importance of 
implementing the Arusha agreements, Francois Mitterrand urged 
Bill Clinton to intervene to ensure that a UN force was finally 
deployed in Rwanda: The international community must react 
rapidly or the terms of the agreement, Francois Mitterrand 
writes, "are likely to be violated." 
  "When I took office," a top official now admits, "I wondered 
about the French presence in Rwanda. It was explained to me 
that Burundi and Rwanda had joined the `Franco-African family.' 
They should not be abandoned."

  [Excerpts] Bordeaux, France, June 27 (AFP) -- France 
considers that Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene is still 
the best candidate for presidency of the European Commission 
despite Britain's veto, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said 
here Monday [27 June]. 
  "When 11 countries out of 12 have agreed on a name, I don't 
see why we should change tack," Juppe said in this southwestern 
city, referring to Britain's veto of Dehaene at the European 
summit in Corfu, Greece at the weekend. 
  "Jean-Luc Dehaene's candidacy was a good one and the British 
veto provoked this crisis which the EU [European Union] really 
did not need. I hope that by July 15, wisdom and reason will 
prevail," he said. 
  Germany, which takes over the six-month revolving presidency 
of the EU on Friday from Greece, has called another summit for 
July 15 to resolve the issue of who will succeed Jacques Delors, 
a French socialist, to head the EU's executive commission. 
  In Paris, Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said 
Dehaene "is an excellent candidate and remains so." He remarked 
that only Britain had vetoed Dehaene who had otherwise been 
backed by the 11 other European Union leaders in Corfu. 
  "It will be Germany's task to find the consensus on Dehaene. 
It's easier to go from 11 to 12 than to start again at zero," 
Duque said. [passage omitted] 
  Dehaene himself told RTBF public television that "I remain a 
candidate." 
  "A consensus must emerge at the European council on the name 
of the European president and the fact that Europe is blocked by 
Britain is not good, all the more so as Mr. Major's opposition 
is motivated by domestic reasons," he said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Daniel Bernard: "Emmanuelli Plans Congress for </F>
His Coronation"] 
  [Excerpts] [Socialist Party, PS, First Secretary] Henri 
Emmanuelli has finally achieved the impossible. After meeting 
with Pierre Mauroy, Laurent Fabius, Michel Rocard, and Martine 
Aubry on Tuesday [21 June] and continuing his consultations 
yesterday (directly or through the eclectic Jean Glavany), the 
new first secretary has managed to persuade all factions to take 
part in the new PS leadership. 
  From the start of the national bureau meeting, the deputy 
for 
les Landes -- rather edgy, according to several participants -- 
announced the convening of an extraordinary congress scheduled 
for September. Rocard's supporters, who had demanded the 
announcement of such a consultation of the members, no longer 
had any reason to refuse to participate in the leadership. 
[passage omitted] 
  Although this "transitional" team is to be confirmed at the 
fall congress, Henri Emmanuelli did not seem to consider his own 
leadership of the party to be transitional. Of course, his 
mandate will be reviewed. But he has already indicated that he 
would be "the first signatory of a motion," which he already 
knows will be "relatively brief." This will be an opportunity 
for the PS, he said, to "regain a clear political direction" 
which "only the members have the right and responsiblity" to 
define. To break with the "slide from democracy" and the 
"extremes" which have had the effect of "weakening the political 
debate," the first secretary expressed the hope that "a majority 
and minority" should emerge "in order that the party regains a 
democratic rhythm." 
  Although he wants to make the PSF "a normal party," Henri 
Emmanuelli above all wants a "boost be given to the Left," not 
to stick to "the Left's traditional liturgy," but because "the 
men and women of the Left no longer identify with the PS." 
Until the PS has clearly established its identity on the Left, 
the first secretary refused to reveal which Socialist candidate 
had his preference for the presidential election. "I cannot 
resign myself to placing the PS in splendid isolation. I want 
the PS to live within the family of the Left," the man to whom 
presidential ambitions are already being attributed, said simply!

  [Text] Paris, June 28 (AFP) -- Bernard Tapie, France's 
debt-ridden tycoon and left-wing politician, said he would 
defend himself in parliament here Tuesday afternoon [28 June] in 
a debate on whether his parliamentary immunity should be lifted. 
  The state-owned Credit Lyonnais is seeking security for $220 
million of debts owed it by Tapie and earlier this month moved 
against his four-master luxury yacht, the Phocea, the world's 
biggest sailing boat and the symbol of the tycoon's financial 
and political success. 
  Bankers seized the 13-million-dollar yacht owned by Bernard 
Tapie on June 1. 
  Tapie, an MP for Marseille, told AFP he wanted to keep his 
National Assembly seat and would therefore reject all 
accusations in parliament. 
  He was to give a news conference at the National Assembly, 
the French lower house, before the parliament debate. 
  The Credit Lyonnais' subsidiary, SDBO, won a court ruling to 
block movement and use of Tapie's 74-metre (240-feet) vessel 
from Marseille after it decided to call in Tapie's debts 
alleging he had failed to honour the terms of a debt 
rescheduling agreement. 
  The yacht remains Tapie's formal property until the bank's 
dispute with the 51-year-old politician has been resolved, but 
the seizure means he cannot dispose of it. The yacht is 
estimated to be worth between 70 and 90 million francs ($11.6 
and 15 million). 
  Tapie, a former minister close to socialist President 
Francois Mitterrand, also won a seat in the European Parliament 
at the head of a centre-left list of candidates on June 12. 
  Tapie's popularity has not been affected by an array of 
embezzlement charges against him involving companies in his 
Groupe Bernard Tapie, the Olympique Marseille football club 
accounts, and the Phocea.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Charles Lambroschini: "The Weight of the </F>
Past"] 
  [Excerpts] France's solitude in the Rwandan affair confirms 
an old rule of foreign policy: You do not take risks by 
consensus. 
  It was on its own initiative that the French Government 
decided to offer the United Nations 2,000 troops to go and 
protect the pockets of Tutsi refugees surrounded by Hutus. 
[passage omitted] 
  However, yesterday's refusal by the OAU to support the 
intervention was a jolt for the diplomatic machinery. In the 
eyes of the former colonies, the motive of humanitarian aid 
stated by France is just an excuse. The former colonial power 
can only be driven by impure intentions. 
  The point has been reached where the OAU is putting its own 
impotence down to a plot by white powers. The official 
communique states that if the OAU has been unable to set up a 
peacekeeping force that could have put an end to the massacre, 
it was because the developed countries have provided neither 
logistic nor financial assistance. A supposedly decisive 
indicator of this maneuver is the fact that, two months after 
the Security Council decided to send a force of 5,500 blue 
helmets from nine African states into Rwanda, only 550 troops 
have been effectively deployed. 
  The carnage in Rwanda can be traced back to the fact that 
African reality is first and foremost tribal in nature. An 
ancient feeling of hate continues to oppose the Hutus, the 
majority and former vassals, and the Tutsis, the feudal 
minority. Between 1990 and 1993, French support for the 
majority race seemed to be in line with the democratic ideals of 
the West. However, it clashed with the local situation. 
  The Tutsis in the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front], the rebel 
movement that now has the upper hand militarily, thus remain 
determined to sabotage any attempts at French intervention. 
They have the implicit support of Belgium, which has two 
reasons for taking their side. At the time of colonization, the 
governors sent by Brussels found it more effective to give their 
support to the maintaining of the traditional balance, i.e., 
Tutsis on top and the Hutus on the bottom. Since independence, 
Brussels has reproached Paris for supplanting it in its former 
colonies in the name of maintaining the French-speaking culture. 
  When French paratroopers landed in Kolwezi, this audacity 
was 
accepted by the Africans because the gesture was irreproachable. 
It was intended to both rescue European nationals and to put a 
stop to a subversive operation controlled from outside by the 
Cubans. Today, however, there are no expatriates remaining to be 
evacuated and the country that stands accused of interfering is 
France. 
  In Europe, the French are exemplary when they take a leading 
role, as they did successfully in Bosnia and in the GATT talks. 
However, in Africa, they may have to resign themselves to the 
fact that rather than accepting a lifeline thrown in from the 
outside, the Africans would rather all drown together.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Franz-Olivier Giesbert: "Of Weeds and </F>
Vegetables"] 
  [Text] One may hope that, one day, a statesman will dare 
shun the customary leaden rhetoric and state clearly the 
following: There is a British problem in Europe. A problem 
which has just found a new illustration at the Corfu summit. 
  Mr. Major, whose standing in his country is now lower than 
that of any of his predecessors, has found a way to improve it 
at home. By using his right of veto against the appointment of 
Mr. Dehaene as Mr. Delors' successor to lead the European 
Commission, the British prime minister is assured to improve his 
standing in opinion polls -- an easy enough proposition given 
his current dismal approval ratings. 
  Not that he himself is hostile toward the Dehaene. By 
vetoing Mr. Dehaene, a candidate backed both by France and 
Germany, because of his pro-European views, Mr. Major was only 
expressing a deep-rooted feeling in Great Britain, a feeling 
which makes it viscerally antagonistic to the construction of 
Europe. One only has to read the British press: It is 
generally anti-European, sometimes frantically so. Once again, 
de Gaulle was right: England is an island which bridges and 
tunnels will never succeed in anchoring to the continent. 
Bringing it into the Common Market was a mistake. It should 
have been made no more than an associate member. 
  Today, the rot has set in. The British will not hear of a 
Europe that is more than a free-trade zone. All they can think 
of is to broaden it more and more, so as to dilute and drown it 
in its own contradictions. Their feet are inside Europe, but 
not so their head. This is a pathological case. It also is an 
ideological one. Should they be kicked out of the European 
Union, then? While currently taboo, this is a question well 
worth asking. One of these days, the European Union will have 
to answer it instead of sticking its head in the sand. 
  Of course, one must be wary of simplistic, knee-jerk 
anti-British notions. First of all because the land of 
Shakespeare is one of European civilization's brightest stars. 
Second, because history has shown that its people -- 
Churchillian at heart -- never fail to exceed themselves when 
the world is crumbling all around. The more perilous the times, 
the greater they show themselves to be. Of all nations, France 
should know. Even Victor Hugo said that "England will always be 
a sister to France." 
  However, no one gets married or engaged with one's sister. 
Hence Britain's feeling of isolation. It does not accept that 
Europe was built on a foundation consisting of France and 
Germany by men who were traumatized by the latest World War and 
who said: "Never again!" Britain cannot reconcile itself to 
the philosophy expressed by de Gaulle's apocryphal phrase: 
"Europe -- it is France and Germany. The others, they are but 
vegetables." 
  But is Mr. Major's Britain finally not going to be regarded 
as a mere weed?

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Giuseppe Tatarella by </F>
Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "Regions, a Mine 
Defused"] 
  [Text] Tatarella, Berlusconi's deputy in the government, 
comes flying to the rescue only on two specific conditions: 
That there is a problem, and that the problem is considered 
impossible to solve. "Minister of Harmony" is how the man that 
[National Alliance, AN, leader] Fini chose to put into the 
executive to redress the balance on the Right likes to refer to 
himself. Just listen to the sibylline formula that the 
telecommunications minister used to "advise" the wise men at the 
RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] to leave the RAI of their 
own free will: "I hope that the guardians of public service 
impartiality, the interpreters of both the spirit and the letter 
of the law, will always have a home in Viale Mazzini and Saxa 
Rubra [RAI buildings]." 
  Strictly according to the rules, in other words, Dematte and 
company are safe. But in actual fact, following the political 
changes brought by the two elections on 27 March and 12 June, it 
is up to them, the old governors, to have the tact to resign. 
So, is this the guardians' last week, in view of the imminent 
revision of the save-the-RAI decree? "I do not have the agenda 
to hand," says Tatarella evasively. The AN deputy thus granted 
IL GIORNALE this first interview in his role as deputy prime 
minister to talk solely about the great reform. And, at least 
in part, this is his prerogative, as Tatarella has just pulled 
off another of his feats, this time an institutional one, by 
bringing the exponents of the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and 
the League into agreement on the subject on which they were most 
divided, regional autonomy. The cabinet is now about to approve 
a constitutional bill that, for the first time ever, brings 
together presidential government and federalism: the direct 
election of the presidents of the regional governments and a 
majority system for all 15 regular regions. On the basis of 
this unitary principle, each region will adopt the electoral 
model that it prefers: one-tier, French-style two-tier, 
three-way second ballot of the type practiced in Sardinia, and 
so on. 
  [Guiglia] A lot of smoke and no fire, this is what the 
opposition is saying. Will a bill of this sort ever see the 
light of day? 
  [Tatarella] All fire and no smoke, and the fact that Salvi 
of 
the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and Rotondi of the 
[Italian] Popular Party [PPI] are so cross about it is exactly 
what proves it. They are the ones making the smoke. Using old 
tactics, they had sent up smoke signals indicating agreement 
around [Institutional Reform Minister] Speroni's original 
proposal to delegate the electoral system to the regions. But 
this signal really concealed an attempt to get the government 
coalition to fall out. The attempt failed miserably. The 
executive will examine the Speroni bill, amended to take account 
of our demands, which emerged from the meetings held between AN 
and the League, between Fini and Bossi, and between the experts, 
Fisichella and Miglio, even before the government was born. 
  [Guiglia] Which side made more concessions, the Northern 
League or the AN? 
  [Tatarella] Neither, and I am definitely not saying so for 
diplomatic reasons. It was a matter of incorporating the burden 
of the talks that our two delegations had had beforehand into 
the proposal drafted by the institutional reform minister. We 
had to combine the AN's demand for direct democracy with the 
League's demand for local democracy and autonomy. An ad hoc 
committee comprising Maroni, Del Debbio, and myself had been 
appointed at [Education Minister] D'Onofrio's suggestion, and 
all we did was reconvene it, as Berlusconi suggested. This way 
we arrived at the decision to stand by the agreed program, all 
under the guidance of Minister Speroni. 
  [Guiglia] And what if it turned out to be just a wonderful, 
unattainable project? 
  [Tatarella] It is a challenge to the opposition. Let it come 
out into the open and, instead of thinking about the leader that 
is no more, start thinking about the reform that may be. And 
let it start now, otherwise it might give grounds for suspicion 
that the opposition wants to slow the pace of regional electoral 
reform in parliament so that the regions will go to the polls 
with the old proportional system, which is regrettably still in 
force, and which forms the highway for the associationism system 
of the dominant groups in the PDS and PPI. 
  [Guiglia] And what if constitutional reform runs aground 
between the two houses of parliament? 
  [Tatarella] We shall have to resort to ordinary legislation; 
but you can be sure of one thing: The regions will not go to 
the polls again under the proportional system. 
  [Guiglia] [Interior Minister] Maroni has granted local 
authorities greater freedom to recruit staff. An instance of 
state handouts on First Republic lines? 
  [Tatarella] The press has emphasized only a part of Maroni's 
initiative. First of all, there is a general criterion laid 
down by the Treasury. Furthermore, its purpose is also to 
lessen the political weight and powers of discretion held by 
some local authority technical offices.

<F P=106> [Report by Rinaldo Gianola on remarks Fiat Chairman Gianni </F>
Agnelli made to journalists in Cernobbio; date not given: 
"Agnelli Reserved on Berlusconi: `But I Would Vote For Him 
Again'"] 
  [Text] Cernobbio -- The government "has certainly done 
little, even though its initial measures are in the right 
direction." "The recovery of the automobile market in Italy is 
nonexistent." "The improvement of the economy in Europe is not 
itself capable of resolving the problems of unemployment and 
public finance, which is causing an extremely critical situation 
in Italy." Fiat Chairman Gianni Agnelli came to Lake Como to 
take part in the seminar organized by the Council for 
Italian-U.S. Relations, and took the opportunity, both in his 
speech and when talking with journalists, to express his opinion 
about the political and economic issues of the moment. From the 
Berlusconi government's first moves to the failure of the Corfu 
summit, and from the recovery to the restlessness of the 
financial markets. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Mr. Agnelli, how do you judge Mr. 
Berlusconi's first moves? 
  [Agnelli] He certainly has not done much yet, but the first 
measures are in the right direction... 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Including in the direction of a reform of 
public finance? Is there not a danger that the necessary 
corrective moves will be postponed too long? 
  [Agnelli] The sooner they implement the reform, the better 
for everyone. Of course, it must be said that this government 
has only existed for 45 days; it has been distracted by the 
European elections and has not been able to do much. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] So would you still express a vote of 
confidence in it? 
  [Agnelli] Definitely, yes, just as I would grant it to other 
governments, from an institutional viewpoint. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Is Fiat experiencing a recovery? 
  [Agnelli] A distinction must be drawn: The recovery of the 
automobile market is weak in Europe, but it is nonexistent in 
Italy, on which, as is well known, Fiat depends to a large 
extent. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] So should there be incentives to facilitate 
sales? 
  [Agnelli] It is not up to me to discuss such matters. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you think that the recovery that is 
emerging in Europe could spread and grow stronger? 
  [Agnelli] The overall climate seems calmer, but we must 
consider how to strengthen the recovery, how to set in motion a 
strong and lasting recovery. The spontaneous improvement 
envisaged for the second half of 1994 and for 1995 does not 
itself seem capable of resolving the two structural problems 
assailing Europe -- the worrying level of unemployment and the 
public finance situation. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Are there any solutions in the short term? 
  [Agnelli] There are no miracle solutions to unemployment, 
and 
there is now widespread agreement that Europe's inability to 
curb the loss of jobs stems from structural factors such as the 
great rigidity of the labor market and the excessive extent of 
the welfare state. If Europe wants to create new job 
opportunities it must have the courage and the determination to 
tackle these problems, to impart flexibility to the economic 
system and to carry out a proper and incisive reform of the 
welfare state. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] From an industrial viewpoint, what is the 
way 
to support the recovery? 
  [Agnelli] Europe must continue along the path of pay 
restraint; it must support investments, especially in the major 
infrastructure networks; it must take action against rigidities 
and bottlenecks that present sufficient mobility of production 
factors and especially of labor, so as not to create obstacles 
to the prompt adaptation of production to the variability of 
demand. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] The sudden declines in the international 
markets indicate great alarm about economic prospects, about 
trends in inflation and interest rates. 
  [Agnelli] It is essential to issue strong and clear signals 
to the markets. Negative expectations threaten to influence 
Europe's recovery, precisely through an increase in the cost of 
money. Although it can be said that the worst period of the 
crisis is now behind us, the recovery is not only modest, but 
still seems very unsteady and based on policies that enjoy 
little confidence on the part of the markets. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] The Corfu summit ended without an agreement 
on the next president of the Commission. Is that a worrying 
sign? 
  [Agnelli] They will meet and discuss it again. For us 
Italians, it does not seem to me to be a major problem whether 
the candidate is Dutch or Belgian. Personally, I would choose 
GATT Secretary General Peter Sutherland for his professional 
qualities. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] So is there not another split within the 
European Union? 
  [Agnelli] British Prime Minister Major has suffered so many 
blows at home that he wanted to gain some satisfaction abroad by 
blocking the choice of the new president.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bernard Guetta: "Major's Tragic Mistake"] </F>
  [Text] Politics, ideology, the absence of a historical 
vision. Everything seems to have driven John Major to prompt 
this European crisis. As far as politics is concerned, the 
facts are well known. Unappreciated by his electorate, who 
recently humiliated him by granting Labor a triumph in the 
European elections, the British prime minister is, above all, 
unpopular within his own party. Indeed, the Conservatives accuse 
him of lacking charisma, while the Right of his party -- which 
has not forgiven him for betraying Thatcher and which accuses 
him of being too European (no less!) -- is just waiting for its 
chance for revenge. 
  So John Major had everything to gain from being tough in 
Corfu, because in that way he disarmed the Thatcherites while at 
the same time displaying strength of character, which hitherto 
has not been regarded as his foremost quality. 
  The second reason for Britain's veto is less petty. True, 
the Belgian prime minister -- from whom John Major wanted to 
withhold the presidency of the Commission -- is the opposite of 
an extreme economic liberalist and therefore of a British 
Conservative. A Christian Democrat, but from the left-wing of 
this movement, Jean- Luc Dehaene is indeed, from the political 
viewpoint, another Delors, imbued with social Catholicism; 
convinced that it is the state that creates the difference 
between a market economy and the law of the jungle; and, last, a 
supporter of a Europe that is present on the international scene 
and whose influence extends beyond that of a free trade area. 
  All this is a matter for a genuine debate -- a political 
Europe versus a free trade Europe; a Europe of social consensus 
versus a laissez-faire Europe; the Europe of the new ideological 
Right versus the Europe of the social-democratic and 
Christian-social center. 
  Then there is the question of the historical vision. Here 
there is no debate. The facts are clear to all: John Major's 
Britain is simply blind. It refuses to see, first, that the 
United States of the post-communist era has its mind mainly on 
regaining its economic health, that leading the world is the 
least of its concerns, and that it therefore no longer needs a 
Britain which, halfway between itself and Europe, will represent 
it there. 
  Britain no longer has a future as a forward post of the 
United States. Its future is Europe. It has no other, but, 
incapable of acknowledging this obvious truth, it fails to see 
that it could perform an exceptional role within the European 
Union. 
  A crisis is in fact looming within Europe, because of the 
influence that Germany is acquiring. It is the Union's most 
populous country, and also the one which will derive the 
greatest benefits from it. Austria, Finland, Norway, and Sweden 
-- the four states that will join the Union next year -- are 
closer to the Germanic world than to France, Britain, or 
southern Europe. Already Europe is sliding toward the north, 
toward Protestantism and austerity. And this is just the first 
step. Central Europe is knocking on the Union's door. It will 
enter, too, and this part of Europe is, from every viewpoint -- 
historical, cultural, linguistic, and of course economic -- 
indissolubly linked to Germany. 
  Having been invented by the French, the united Europe is 
becoming a German Europe. It is no conspiracy. It is worse 
than that. It is geography that is dictating this, because 
united Germany is at the center of the western part of the 
continent, which now extends as far as the borders of the former 
USSR. 
  Apart from the Germans, who are terrified by this situation, 
each country is behaving as though the collapse of the Wall had 
changed nothing. The French in particular still base their 
entire foreign policy on strengthening the "Franco-German axis." 
But some day, doubtless soon, the malaise will surface. If 
only it wanted to, Britain could, by making a real commitment to 
Europe, become the guarantor of the continental balance, helping 
to counterbalance Germany's power. 
  Britain needs Europe as much as Europe needs it. And yet 
because of Britain Europe is losing time. And losing itself.

  [Text] The Vatican, 27 Jun (INA) -- Deputy Prime Minister 
Tariq 'Aziz met here today with Cardinal Sodano, the Vatican 
secretary of state. During the meeting, they discussed the good 
relations between Iraq and the Vatican. The deputy prime 
minister explained Iraq's position on the implementation of the 
Security Council resolutions and the effects of the continued 
unjust blockade against the Iraqi people. 
  'Aziz asserted that the legal and sound implementation of 
Security Council resolutions requires the immediate, 
unconditional lifting of this blockade. 
  Cardinal Sodano noted his understanding of Iraq's position. 
He also reiterated the stand of the Vatican and His Holiness 
the Pope in rejecting the blockade. He also expressed his 
sympathy with the suffering of the Iraqi people as a result of 
this blockade. 
  The deputy prime minister will meet with Pope John Paul II 
tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Report by Stefano Maroni: "Veltroni Moves Up, Overtakes </F>
D'Alema, and Wins"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- Sixty-four for [L'UNITA editor] 
Veltroni, and 42 for [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, 
outgoing Deputy Secretary] D'Alema. Unexpectedly, in an opinion 
poll which largely belies the most accredited forecasts made on 
the eve, the majority of the PDS federations have indicated the 
L'UNITA editor as their favorite candidate to succeed [outgoing 
PDS Secretary] Occhetto, thus confronting today's executive 
board and tomorrow's National Council with the almost certainty 
of a duel to the last vote, as well as with the difficulty of 
reading the political implications of a result which in itself 
-- regardless of the numbers in the PDS miniparliament -- does 
not yet deprive the Gallipoli deputy [D'Alema] of all his 
chances. However -- at least initially -- this result 
undoubtedly prevents both him and Veltroni from withdrawing 
without putting up a fight or from reaching a gentlemen's 
agreement -- a solution which the opinion poll figures and 
significance now rule out altogether. Thus, looming ahead on 
the PDS horizon, is now also the possibility that neither of the 
two candidates will obtain the necessary quorum and, therefore, 
the PDS may face the uncertainty of having to refer the election 
of the new secretary to the party congress. [passage omitted] 
  However, there are indications weighing -- heavily -- 
against 
the L'UNITA editor. True, he is backed by a majority of 
Emilia's federations, but Bologna, Modena, and Ravenna -- which 
together comprise 25,000 members more than all the other 
federations put together -- are siding with D'Alema. 
Furthermore, the former lower house floor leader is still 
backed by the most important Lombard federations, from Milan to 
Mantua and Brescia, and the same applies to Rome, the whole of 
Puglia, and the south, where the PDS has fewer members, but 
where it won in the elections. Finally, D'Alema is backed by 
most of the leaders interviewed at Botteghe Oscure [PDS 
headquarters], including deputies, senators, federation 
scretaries, and CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] 
leaders. [passage omitted] 
  In short, a battle will be waged -- an open battle fought 
out 
in a climate which, despite the efforts made by both opponents, 
is beginning to be poisonous. Weighing down on the rivals is 
also the uncertainty over the next moves planned by Occhetto, 
who is regarded as the hidden but clearly identifiable 
protagonist of the last two weeks of strife within the PDS. 
Support for Veltroni derives much of its thrust from the wish 
to sweep aside the leading group that was defeated in the 
elections, and to press for a radical renewal of the PDS style, 
men, and political language. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Cape Verdean President Antonio Mascarenhas 
Monteiro arrived just before 2400 at Lisbon airport. He is to 
attend a congress of Cape Verdean cadres. Walter Medeiros 
interviewed him. 
  [Begin recording] [Medeiros] [passage omitted] What are you 
hoping for from this congress? 
  [Mascarenhas] Well, this congress is a historic event of 
capital importance because as you know Cape Verde places great 
trust in its diaspora. We believe that it is an integral part 
of the Cape Verde nation. 
  I will have the honor of opening the first congress of Cape 
Verdean cadres abroad, and I believe that this congress 
represents a strong wish of the diaspora to participate in the 
development of Cape Verde. 
  [Medeiros] Will you appeal to them to invest more in their 
country and appeal also for national unity, as is known more 
Cape Verdeans live outside the country than inside? 
  [Mascarenhas] Obviously it will also be an appeal. I believe 
at the moment the conditions have been met to enable all Cape 
Verdeans to participate in the process of deepening our 
democracy and of laying the foundations for a sustainable 
economic development. 
  I hope that palpable results will emerge from the congress 
for the good of Cape Verde and the good of the diaspora. 
  [Medeiros] [passage omitted] Has Cape Verde the conditions 
to 
receive its people living abroad? 
  [Mascarenhas] Of course not. At the moment we have about 
600,000 or 700,000 Cape Verdeans abroad, which is virtually 
twice the number of those living in Cape Verde. But I believe 
that the diaspora can participate, can make its contribution, 
and we are counting on it. 
  So, this congress will be a landmark in bringing the Cape 
Verdeans abroad closer to their motherland. I hope the congress 
will take place and will be a successful one. 
  [Medeiros] [passage omitted] What is the future for a 
Lusophone commonwealth? 
  [Mascarenhas] I think a rosy future, because it is a 
community that has virtues and potential to develop. The seven 
Portuguese-speaking countries are countries with very strong 
historic and cultural ties. I would even say there is great 
solidarity and fraternity; these values must be preserved and 
deepened. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva's first reaction to the 
incidents yesterday and early this morning at Lisbon Bridge was 
that the whole thing was planned and organized by professional 
agitators. The prime minister made these comments at the end of 
the Corfu summit. He went on to say that extremist forces were 
behind the crowds: 
  [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] The action that took place 
yesterday in Lisbon is totally unacceptable in a democratic 
state. Attempts were made to block the city of Lisbon and, 
according to information I have received, these were organized 
attempts, planned by professionals who clearly were attempting 
to destabilize the country and cause agitation. We cannot be 
complacent, despite the openness and dialogue that we offer, 
when we can see clearly that the intention was to engage in 
agitation, provocation, and violence. I would like to praise the 
security forces, who, despite the extreme provocation, stayed 
calm and knew just when to act in defense of our country's 
legitimate democracy. 
  It is obvious that we were concerned. According to 
statements made by some people, we believe that apart from the 
professional organizers -- and it is not possible to carry out 
such an action without methodical planning aimed at agitation -- 
there may be some extremist political forces behind the action, 
given the language that was used and the people among those who 
were agitating the crowds, people linked to the Communist Party 
and the far left. I am also bearing in mind the statements made 
by several members of the Communist Party. There were some 
people that journalists recognized among the protestors as 
members of the Communist Party. [end recording]

  [Text] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana has explained 
the agreements reached by NATO and the Partnership for Peace 
[PFP] to the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Congress of 
Deputies. 
  Javier Solana highlighted the Spanish Government's decision 
to take part in cooperation agreements reached by the Western 
allies with Central and East European countries. Javier Solana: 
  [Begin Solana recording] The government wants to play an 
active role in these cooperation activities linking the allies 
to Central and East European countries. Our country has already 
signed several cooperation agreements with Central European 
countries, which establish bilateral military cooperation 
programs; we will try to strengthen these programs. 
  Spain has achieved -- in several cases -- development in 
certain fields that is comparable to that in these countries. 
We think that we can add experiences in the defense field that 
can be particularly useful to these countries. 
  At the same time, and more specifically in the PFP 
framework, 
we will also take part in other multilateral cooperation 
activities with other Alliance member countries. [end recording]

  [Text] The main objective of the visit paid to the Peoples' 
Republic of China by Spanish Industry Minister Juan Manuel 
Eguiagaray was to increase trade. Eguiagaray is on a tour of 
the Far East, which now takes him to Hong Kong. This is what 
Juan Manuel Eguiagaray had to say to our radio station: 
  [Begin Eguiagaray recording] I have signed a memorandum of 
understanding with the Chinese Minister for Electricity [as 
heard]. It could lead to building electric power stations as 
well as to working together in the areas of nuclear energy, 
renewable sources of energy, and in all that concerns our own 
experience in building up a strong electricity industry and 
running it. 
  To give you a better general idea, we did not only speak 
about electricity. I met six ministers who deal with topics 
ranging from telecommunications to the electronics industry as 
well as machinery and the chemical industry. I also met those 
responsible for the State Planning Commission. 
  In most of these areas there is interest in more Spanish 
involvement in a country where there is still a lot to be done.

  [Text] On his arrival at Madrid's Barajas Airport today 
from China, Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, minister of industry and 
energy, said it was very important that the presence of Spanish 
industrial interests should be increasingly obvious in a market 
of 1 billion people, as in the People's Republic of China. 
Eguigaray described his visit to a country with 13 percent 
economic growth and that offers major targets for Spanish 
industry as "lengthy and fruitful." The minister also said that 
the visit sought to boost and consolidate relations with China 
following the establishment of economic cooperation and a 
sizeable credit channel during the 1993 visit to that country by 
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.

  [Text] Spanish Economics and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes 
has spoken to the relevant committee in the Senate about several 
topics related to his department such as the dollar's problems 
and the consequences on financial markets. Over to our reporter 
Manuel de Ramon. 
  [de Ramon] Financial markets might have just been through 48 
hours of instability. Calm might return slowly to the financial 
world. This is what Economics Finance Minister Pedro Solbes has 
just said in the Senate. However he admits that the problems 
were caused by the dollar's bad standing and that means that 
everything hinges on the dollar's value stabilizing. Over to 
Pedro Solbes. 
  [Begin Solbes recording] This morning it seems as though 
things are somewhat calmer. However it is true that we have 
just weathered a complicated 48 hours, very difficult hours. 
  It is true that the dollar is the root cause of this 
problem. 
And until its value stabilizes , until the U.S. markets become 
calmer, all the rest will continue to live with this unstable 
tendency. [end recording] 
  [de Ramon] Furthermore, Pedro Solbes has repeated that he is 
confident that the Spanish economy will grow over the next year 
by between 2.5 and 2.6 percent. After 1996 the rate of growth 
should be higher. 
  Minister Solbes believes that the Bank of Spain will 
maintain 
interest rates because there is no reason to change them.

    [Editorial Report] The lead domestic news story in leading 
Helsinki dailies HELSINGIN SANOMAT and HUFVUDSTADSBLADET for 12 
June was the decision of the Swedish People's Party (RKP) to 
reject a resolution giving unqualified endorsement for a yes 
vote in the 18 October referendum on European Union [EU] 
membership. As reported by HELSINGIN SANOMAT's Pekka Vaisanen, 
the party at its convention in Turku instead voted 100-80 to 
satisfy itself with simply supporting the EU accession agreement 
as signed by the government. According to Vaisanen, the debate 
showed clearly that most delegates favored EU membership, but 
voted on compromise wording favored by RKP Chairman and 
Communications Minister Ole Norrback, who feared a strong 
membership resolution could alienate the party's vocal anti-EU 
minority in the March 1995 parliamentary election. Norrback also 
was seen as hoping to keep open the chances of making electoral 
alliances with members of the tiny Liberal Party and other new 
independent movements in the spring election. Among such 
grass-roots movements is one supporting popular Defense Minister 
Elisabeth Rehn. 
  Led by Deputy Chairman Hakan Malm and mainly representing 
agricultural interests, the anti-EU forces had wanted an 
additional statement declaring that Finland should have the 
right to change its decision on membership if Sweden's 
membership referendum went the other way. This was handily 
defeated, however. The most outspoken opposition to membership 
heard at the convention came from a rural delegate, who warned 
that Finland would lose the ability to control economic policy 
under the EMU (European Monetary Union), and that in a future 
recession this would hurt forestry exports. 
  According to Maria Romantschuck of HUVUDSTADSBLADET, this 
compromise allowed the RKP ministers in Prime Minister Aho 
center-right cabinet to claim to have received "support from the 
entire convention for the government having signed the 
agreement." 
  In a separate analysis piece, Vaisanen asserts that those in 
favor of EU membership had a "clear upper hand" in the debate. 
"The Swedish People's Party delegates want into the EU above all 
for security and economic policy reasons," he claims. A theme 
often heard was the need to tie Finland to the Nordics and the 
West in general. Again according to the author, for the 
delegates it was "important to show Finland belongs to West 
Europe, and in no circumstances to East Europe." Quoting from 
one delegate's speech: "The alternative to EU membership is that 
we will become a small island on Russia's flank."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "SLC Tightened Up Its EU Line"] </F>
  [Text] The congress of the Central Association of Swedish 
Agricultural Producers (SLC) yesterday adopted a negative stance 
on European Union [EU] membership, as did its congress in Turku 
two years ago. A statement points out that because of the 
northern location, long distances, and structure of Finland and 
the unsatisfactory package that resulted from the negotiations, 
agriculture and market gardening are not ready to meet the 
competition in the EU. 
  The congress, which was unanimous in its statement, had 
reformulated the executive's proposed statement. This was 
thought to be "toothless." The executive's resolution did not 
contain any clear stance. 
  The resolution stresses that if, despite everything, the 
referendum leads to membership, the SLC expects there to be 
national consensus on domestic food production and on rural 
policy. 
  The SLC is also demanding that the scale of the proposed 
national support measures for agriculture be approved by the 
Eduskunta and also by the EU Commission before they form the 
basis for the referendum. 
  Ola Rosendahl, who was reelected SLC chairman yesterday, 
said 
in general terms in a review of the situation that despite all 
the shortcomings of the government's decision in principle it 
has to be admitted that this government could hardly have 
produced a better support package and that the next government 
will not even come anywhere near. 
  He said that it remains for agriculture to consider what 
possibility there is of living with the support package, and 
what possibility there is of achieving a no to membership in the 
referendum and how in such a situation what shape agriculture 
policy can take.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Debt Will Soon Equal Our Entire GNP"] </F>
  [Text] The Finnish national debt is fast approaching 100 
percent of our gross national product, and it will not be 
possible to achieve the goal the Finance Ministry proclaimed 
again last year of halting the debt at 70 percent, warned 
Finance Minister Iiro Viinanen. 
  He estimated that the debt will be close to 500 billion 
[Finnish] markkas [FMk] in 1997. 
  Viinanen said the European Union (EU) solution will increase 
the need to take out around FMk10 billion in new loans next 
year, while at the same time the ministries have exceeded their 
budget limits for next year by FMk11 billion. Such a situation 
is serious and precarious, the finance minister stressed. 
  "The debts are becoming an enormous burden on the national 
economy, but many choose not to see this," said Viinanen. 
"However the fact is that the billions that go to service the 
national debt must be taken from somewhere." 
  Viinanen pointed out that it is still true that state 
spending is rising at a faster pace than revenues. Tax revenues 
will not increase much during the late 1990's, he said, at least 
not to the extent that they will offset national budget deficits.

<F P=106> [Article by Tomas Hellen: "Mounting Financial Market Unrest"] </F>
  [Text] Unrest in the domestic money, capital, and foreign 
exchange markets worsened yesterday. Short-term interest rose 
sharply, the markka lost ground, and yield on state bonds was 
listed at record high levels. 
  The Helsinki Stock Exchange was also drawn into the 
pessimistic mood. Price levels fell by an average of over 1 
percent. 
  The bond market was the hardest hit. Yield on the longest 
government securities, 10-year bonds that run to the year 2004, 
was listed at 9.53 percent yesterday, up more than 0.3 percent 
for the day. 
  "An incredibly big change," said director Hannu Holma of 
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki's Treasury division. 
  The interest difference on long-term bonds in relation to 
Germany has now grown to over 2.5 percent. 
  "If we look at the base it is hard to explain such a large 
interest difference. The reasons are probably mainly technical 
and psychological," Holma said. 
  At the same time the three-month HELIBOR [Helsinki Interbank 
Offered Rate] rose 0.33 percent to 5.79 percent and one-year 
interest rose as much as 0.44 percent to 6.80 percent. 
  Tuesday's [7 June] rate for three-month interest is the 
highest since December; in one week it has now risen by almost 1 
percent. Three-month interest was at its lowest point, 4.69 
percent, on 21 February. 
  Despite the rise in interest rates the market clearly 
weakened in relation to leading currencies; for example, the 
German mark cost 3.31 [Finnish] markkas [FMk], two pennia more 
than the day before yesterday, while the ECU basket rose a scant 
penni to FMk6.406 and the dollar rose 3.5 pennia to FMk5.534. 
  It was a Nordic infection -- in Sweden yesterday, interest 
unrest was, if possible, even greater -- uncertainty about the 
government's future and European Union (EU) membership plus 
market psychology were all mentioned as causes. In addition 
confusion increased with regard to the intentions of the Bank of 
Finland with its unclear statements about the monetary policy 
line, which indicators it is really guided by, and how they 
should be interpreted. 
  Yesterday afternoon the Reuters news bureau's financial 
market service sent out a long interview with Pentti 
Pikkarainen, the new head of the central bank's money market 
division. 
  In the interview an amazingly outspoken Pikkarainen 
explained 
that "through a policy decision" in the spring the Bank of 
Finland "permitted a tightening of monetary policy" by letting 
money market interest rates rise. 
  The tightening decision was motivated, according to 
Pikkarainen, by rising long-term interest rates, rapid growth in 
the money supply, rising property prices, and increased 
inflation expectations as a result of the economic recovery. 
  The interview was received with great confusion on the 
market, although it came out so late that it had little 
influence on trading in Helsinki. 
  Earlier this spring the Bank of Finland maintained that the 
monetary policy is neutral, perhaps even unrestrained. However 
the suspicion that the line has now changed was fed by the fact 
that the Bank of Finland has kept a low profile on the market 
recently, despite all the turbulence. 
<H5>  Hamalainen Issues Quick Denial </H5>
  Most people immediately surmised that Pikkarainen, who is 
known as an economist oriented toward monetarism, was speaking 
beyond his authority and did not reflect the opinions of the 
central bank's highest leadership. 
  The Bank of Finland's highest leadership was just as 
surprised. When HUFVUDSTADSBLADET spoke to chief director Sirkka 
Hamalainen at 1630 hours she clearly repudiated Pikkarainen's 
theses. 
  "We have definitely not made any decision to tighten 
monetary 
policy," Hamalainen stated. 
  She described the recent interest rise as a "disturbance," 
caused by the fact that the markets are weak, strongly 
influenced by Sweden in particular and by the uncertainty about 
the government and EU membership. 
  She also stressed that it is market players, not the Bank of 
Finland, who are now driving up short-term interest rates. 
  "However, we at the central bank may have been restrained in 
checking the rise in short-term interest rates that was caused 
by the market. The reason is that we feel the yield curve should 
not be allowed to become steeper." 
  The yield curve illustrates the difference in interest 
levels 
for instruments of various durations. When the Bank of Finland 
says that the curve must not become too "steep" it means that it 
thinks long-term interest rates are too high in relation to 
short-term rates. And as the central bank has no way to directly 
influence long-term interest, flattening the curve must be 
accomplished by pulling short-term interest up or allowing it to 
rise. 
<H5>  Inflation in Line With Goal </H5>
  Hamalainen also stressed that the inflationary trend is 
entirely in line with the central bank's stated goal, i.e., a 
basic inflation rate of "around 2 percent" from the beginning of 
the next year. 
  Basic inflation, which is adjusted for the effect of changes 
in the interest level, among other things, was only 1.9 percent 
for the year up to March. 
  "I have a hard time seeing how any inflation can arise with 
an unemployment rate of 20 percent," she said. 
  "There is no reason to revise the inflation goal for 1995, 
even though we were a little more optimistic about the future in 
February-March," Mikko Spolander, an economist at the Bank of 
Finland, told Reuters yesterday. 
  Spolander pointed out that consumer prices were under some 
pressure from companies attempting to increase their profit 
margins. Inflationary pressure will probably be weak at the 
beginning of 1995, but the picture could be changed by the 
anticipated demands for wage increases during the second half of 
the year. 
  Unlike Pikkarainen, Hamalainen did not express any concern 
about rising property values, but described the rising price 
level as an "adjustment." 
<H5>  Bank Has No Money Supply Goal </H5>
  The fact that short-term interest rose sharply as early as 
Monday [6 June] was due to news of strong growth in the amount 
of money in circulation for April: M-1, i.e., bills and coins in 
circulation plus the general public's cash on hand, increased at 
an annual rate of 11.0 percent. 
  The market's reaction is explained by a statement from 
Pikkarainen at a financial seminar several weeks ago that the 
Bank of Finland would be "concerned" if the money supply 
increases by more than 10 percent. 
  Even if the central bank wanted to tone down the importance 
of individual figures for the total money supply, Pikkarainen 
noted in his Reuters interview yesterday that "it is good that 
the data is released to the market players." 
  However, chief director Hamalainen condemned the fixation on 
the amount of money in circulation. 
  "The Bank of Finland has no money supply goal, and M-1 in 
particular is a very unreliable indicator. It is more important 
to note that lending activities did not expand, for example," 
said the Bank of Finland chief.

<F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: "National Debt Threatens </F>
Upturn"] 
  [Text] The economic upturn in Finland is getting under way 
in earnest and is threatened mainly by the growing national 
debt, the Business Research Institute, ETLA, predicted in its 
latest market forecast. Net foreign debt, previously a limiting 
factor in economic policy, is now declining rapidly with the 
balance of payments showing a steady surplus, ETLA pointed out. 
  "If state borrowing increases in the future as it has done 
so 
far our chance of pursuing an active economic policy will be 
reduced," said ETLA's chief executive, Pentti Vartia. "We cannot 
handle employment policy in a future recession by taking out new 
loans, for example, and interest on the national debt will 
become so large that it rules out the possibility of pursuing an 
active social policy." 
  In spite of the expected upturn, unemployment will remain 
high in Finland. Five years from now, according to the research 
institute's calculations, only 80,000 more people will be 
employed than in 1993. New jobs will be created primarily in 
industry, while jobs will continue to decline in construction 
and agriculture. 
<H5>  Steady Growth </H5>
  But viewed as a whole, the picture of the Finnish economy 
that ETLA has now painted is positive both for this year and for 
the next five years. Research director Jukka Lassila pointed out 
that we can now look forward to a long period of growth and that 
it could be as strong as 6 percent next year. Gross national 
product is expected to increase by 2 percent this year. 
  "The rising interest level does not yet limit our growth 
expectations," said Lassila. "Interest has now reacted primarily 
to external factors such as interest rates around Europe, there 
are no real grounds for a rise in interest on the Finnish market 
just now." 
  Private domestic consumption will start to increase 
gradually, ETLA predicted, but growth on the domestic market 
will continue to lag behind the growth rate in export branches. 
Private consumption is at around the same level this year as it 
was in 1986, but despite the fact that it is now rising by 
several percentage points a year it will still not reach the 
same level in 1998 that it had in 1990. 
  Industrial investments will now grow rapidly, according to 
ETLA's prognosis. However the rapid growth is based on the 
assumption that the world economy also grows and that Finland 
becomes a member of the European Union, EU. Other factors that 
will influence investment resolve include Finnish 
competitiveness remaining good, improved profitability, and 
increased utilization of capacity. 
  "In any case domestic market industries will not increase 
their investments much in the next five years," said Lassila, 
who also thought there would be no significant investment in new 
housing. 
  Vartia saw no big problem in meeting the Bank of Finland's 
2-percent inflation goal for the next five years. We have had 
such a deep depression that there are no big inflationary 
expectations in the wage sector, for example, and the fluid 
markka lessens the external inflationary pressure. 
  Thus, according to ETLA, the big problem is the national 
debt. Offsetting the increased interest expenses would require a 
very restrained spending policy, and past experience shows that 
this kind of thing is hard to implement, the research institute 
noted. According to Vartia, the state's large debt means that 
the best thing we can hope for is a long period of growth, but 
only one that is more rapid than the basic 4-percent alternative 
can balance the debt level. And this also assumes that increased 
tax revenues do not lead to increased public spending.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Challenge for EU Supporters"] </F>
  [Text] From the point of view of the European Union [EU] 
supporters, we are presenting anything but good news today with 
the latest Opinion A/S opinion poll on the Norwegians' attitudes 
to membership in the EU. The opponents have increased and the 
supporters decreased since the last opinion poll in May. At the 
same time another poll shows that the undecideds in North Norway 
are about to become opponents. If the replies in the poll are 
to be believed, a majority of the Norwegian people will say no 
to EU membership regardless of what happens in the referenda in 
Finland and Sweden. 
  In our poll 44 percent said no and 35 percent said yes to 
the 
following question: "If Sweden and Finland become members of the 
EU, how will you vote?" So the supporters of Norwegian EU 
membership are losing ground following the government's 
presentation of a negotiation outcome that is very good, 
particularly as regards our fisheries policy. 
  The opinion polls from Sweden indicate that on that side of 
the border it is the proponents who have finally gotten on the 
offensive. Granted, only 3O.5 percent are as yet saying yes, 
while 40 percent say no. But this is an improvement of 4.5 
percent for the proponents and a loss of 4.8 percent for the 
opposing side. 
  And then there is the peculiar situation with 59.4 percent 
of 
the Icelanders saying yes to an EU membership the country has 
not even applied for yet. The majority are giving the fisheries 
resolution Norway obtained as their reason for saying yes. It 
is a healthy Norwegian trait to be skeptical of the authorities 
and the politicians. But at this point the skeptics must also 
ask themselves what the alternative would be to participating, 
along with Finland and Sweden, in that European community on 
whose door even Iceland is now knocking. 
  Because, contrary to what the Center and the Socialist Left 
parties are saying, the alternative to participating in the fora 
where our common European future is being forged is not to carry 
on as before. Whether you like it or not, we already are in a 
new, more demanding reality than only a few years ago. The 
great challenge for Norwegian farmers is the requirements that 
issue from the revised agreement on tariffs and trade. It is the 
GATT agreement that draws up the broad international regulations 
matrix that both the EU and we will have to respect. 
  Of course the Norwegian opponents have a right to say no. 
But they should also try a little skepticism towards their own 
reasoning. Because those vital Norwegian interests that they 
claim to protect by saying no are also the EU proponents' basis 
for saying yes at the upcoming referendum. Having said that, we 
also want to say that it is the EU proponents who should see 
this latest poll as a challenge. We have six months to go until 
the referendum. But that battle is lost unless the Norwegian 
supporters of the EU go on the offensive the way their 
counterparts in Sweden have succeeded in doing.

<F P=106> ["Focus" article by Prime Minister Carl Bildt: "Corfu </F>
Meeting an Important Link in European Integration"] 
  [Text] Today when I sign for Sweden the agreement on 
membership in the European Union, the EU, alongside the prime 
ministers of Finland, Norway, and Austria, history will be being 
made for our respective countries, as it will for Europe as a 
whole. 
  European cooperation has not always been something that can 
be taken for granted, and in some places it still cannot be. If 
we look back on the history of our continent it is easy to see 
how it has been dominated by conflicts and wars, and how periods 
of cooperation and security have often been torn apart by 
confrontations that have sometimes also led to war. 
  Today's economic cooperation has a firm foundation in the 
concept of peace that was born out of the horrors of the two 
world wars. This simple statement of fact contains the 
explanation of why cooperation has such a strong foothold in 
countries like Germany and France, and why countries that have 
stood or believed they could stand outside the continent's 
conflicts have come to join this cooperation at a later date and 
often with much greater hesitation. 
  The gulf that arose in West European cooperation in the 
fifties -- between the EEC with its close economic and political 
cooperation and EFTA [European Free Trade Association], which 
was only a free trade organization -- is now finally being 
bridged. This gulf is now being overcome because everyone has 
finally been convinced of the value and necessity of cooperation 
that is strong both politically and economically. 
  The cooperation within the framework of the EEC, the EC, and 
the EU since the end of the fifties has certainly not been 
without its problems. But the advantages have been much greater 
than the difficulties. Cooperation has gradually been 
strengthened over the years in order to exploit the strength 
that integration has shown that it produces not only in the 
EEC/EC/EU but also in individual member countries. 
  Taking the step into this cooperation has sometimes been 
controversial, but it is a fact worth pondering -- in the 
Swedish debate too -- that there is not a single member country 
where the idea of withdrawing from this cooperation enjoys 
popular support. 
  With the exception of some odd and notorious extremists 
there 
is no political party in any member country that supports the 
call for withdrawal from this cooperation. Its value and 
strength can hardly be demonstrated any more clearly. Those who 
know what cooperation is do not want to do without it. 
  When the partnership agreement between the EU and Russia and 
the four accession agreements are signed on Corfu today this 
will be a clear indication that it is a new Europe we are 
entering. West Europe is being united as a result of the fact 
that the Nordic area and Austria are now taking their places at 
the very heart of European cooperation at the same time that the 
work on the reunification of Europe as a whole can now begin in 
earnest. 
  The summit in Corfu is a link in the chain of European 
integration. The meeting marks the end of the major task of 
enlargement that has dominated so much of the debate and the 
work inside the Union in recent years. 
  But the meeting on Corfu is also the start of a new phase in 
which questions of growth and the question of extending 
cooperation to Central European and the Baltic states will 
become increasingly important. 
  Sweden is now taking its place as an active observer in the 
EU in order to exert an influence on future cooperation through 
our perspectives and values, but also to derive benefit from the 
possibilities that cooperation offers. 
  And it is a great strength that we are doing this together 
with Norway and Finland. In the last few years the Nordic 
dimension has acquired an ever stronger position in our overall 
European policy. EU membership offers a possibility of Nordic 
reunification that will give new drive to Nordic cooperation. 
  Three concepts are important in the policy we now have to 
pursue as active observers and, after a yes in the referendum on 
13 November, as full members of Europe cooperation: growth, 
openness, and enlargement. 
  The economic questions -- how Europe can again create strong 
growth and real new jobs that can push down unemployment -- has 
become an increasingly important issue since the summit in 
Edinburgh at the end of 1992. 
  The work since then -- not least the so-called white book 
from December 1993 -- has gradually led to an ever greater 
convergence of view on the nature of the problems that the 
European economies are wrestling with and on the policy thrust 
that is needed to solve them. 
  If there still are political differences, there is a 
remarkably strong conviction that it is only a policy aiming at 
definite structural reforms in the direction of more open and 
more dynamic markets that can break long-term unemployment. And 
this also applies to politically difficult questions such as 
reform of the labor market and its regulations. 
  In this context Sweden is viewed in the European debate as 
something of a pioneer. After being seriously affected by major 
structural problems we too have demonstrated in many fields and 
under difficult circumstance the policies needed to solve them. 
  The two important reports that will be discussed on Corfu -- 
on investment in infrastructure and on investment in information 
technologies -- are in line with the policies of the Swedish 
Government. In actual fact our policies in both these fields 
lie in the forefront of European developments. 
  One of the 11 major future investments in infrastructure 
that 
are now being given prominence is the Oresund link. This links 
the Scandinavian peninsula's investments in modern railroads -- 
around 50 billion kronor -- in the period up to the year 2000 
with the investments of around 1,000 billion kronor that will be 
made in continental railroad communications in the same period. 
  Through the Oresund link in connection with the link over 
the 
Fehmarn Belt we will experience a turbo effect for the railroad 
investments which are currently being made in Sweden. 
  Europe is finally waking up to the revolutionary changes 
that 
the new information technologies represent. And exploiting 
these opportunities will only be possible if you are to abandon 
the old monopoly thinking in the way we in Sweden have already 
done. 
  Together with Finland and Britain, Sweden is now in the 
vanguard of opening up the enormous possibilities of 
developments in the field of information technology. Past EU 
decisions that deregulation must be completed by 1998 at the 
latest already appear out of date. The quicker deregulation 
takes place, the greater Europe's chances of asserting itself in 
the new global transformation. 
  In all these fields -- structural changes in the economy, 
investment in new infrastructure, and liberalization to liberate 
information technology -- Sweden is in the vanguard. And this 
front position gives us more scope than others to exploit 
membership of the European Union as a tool to create new and 
real jobs in the typical companies of the future and 
consequently better conditions for growth and prosperity in the 
longer term. 
  Even if economic issues appear to be particularly important 
in a period of rapid development, the development of European 
cooperation will ultimately be decided by the political 
questions surrounding peace and security. 
  I myself am convinced that the crucial task in the years to 
come will be to find the right way to gradually extend 
cooperation to the countries of central Europe and the Baltic 
states. 
  We welcomed the decision at the Copenhagen summit a year ago 
to open the door to membership for these states, and we have 
warmly welcomed Hungary's and Poland's applications for 
membership during the course of the spring. 
  It would, however, be a mistake to underestimate the 
challenges with which this continued process of enlargement will 
confront cooperation. The calls for changes to agricultural and 
regional policy will be considerable, as will the need to change 
decisionmaking procedures and other institutions. 
  Starting now to openly and directly discuss these questions 
is the best way to prepare the way for the decisions to admit 
new members that must be made in the next few years. 
  By its nature European cooperation is an ever continuing 
dialogue and ever continuing negotiations on problems and issues 
that everyone can see are best resolved in cooperation with 
others because they are too big for each individual nation to be 
able to solve alone. 
  At the Corfu meeting Sweden is now finally winning a place 
in 
this dialogue and these negotiations. We are winning an 
influence that those on the outside can never give and 
therefore, at a time of greater internationalism and 
internationalization, a chance to achieve those goals and 
ambitions that only cooperation can offer. 
  Between today's historic meeting on Corfu and the next 
summit 
in Essen in early December there lies a Riksdag election, in 
which the different parties will outline their different visions 
of European cooperation, and the referendum that will decide the 
membership issue. 
  For me it goes without saying that Sweden too should take 
part in the European cooperation in which all other nations are 
striving to take part. The important question really ought not 
to be whether or not we should be involved in cooperation, but 
in what way we should exploit all the possibilities membership 
offers and what vision of the future development of cooperation 
should be ours.

<F P=106> [Report by Lena Hennel: "Membership Does Not Threaten Aid"] </F>
  [Text] Swedish membership in the European Union [EU] does 
not mean that Sweden would isolate itself from the rest of the 
world. 
  This was strongly stressed yesterday when Finance Minister 
Anne Wibble hosted a miniseminar on Sweden's relations with the 
Third World and East Europe. 
  "The EU is not a fortress and Sweden, together with other 
like-minded countries, will see to it that it does not become 
one." 
  Anne Wibble even said that it is possible to strengthen 
global cooperation at the same time as Sweden is working for 
European integration. 
  If Sweden and Norway join the EU they will be able -- 
together with Denmark and the Netherlands -- to work to improve 
the EU's aid policy, Anne Wibble said, at the same time as the 
EU's protectionism in the fields of agriculture and textiles 
must combated. 
  Others present at the seminar were representatives of 
Latvia, 
Estonia, and Uganda, and Danish Development Aid Minister Helle 
Degn. 
  Degn said that she has very positive experience of EU 
cooperation in the development aid field and said that Denmark 
has won a sympathetic hearing among the other countries of the 
Union for its strategy vis-a-vis the developing countries. 
  And she said several times that Swedish membership would 
make 
this even easier. 
  The critics of the EU's aid policy say among other things 
that the EU's former great powers give priority to aid to their 
former colonies. The northern African countries, for example, 
are said to be receiving a disproportionately high level of 
support compared with the poorer countries in southern Africa. 
  But Edith Ssempala, Ugandan ambassador to Sweden, did not 
express any concern that EU membership would have a negative 
effect on Swedish aid. 
  Instead she voiced hopes of a greater Nordic influence on 
the 
EU's aid policy.

<F P=106> [Report by Hans O. Alfredsson: "Colliander Leaving </F>
Politics"] 
  [Excerpt] Vivianne Franzen can now lead New Democracy 
[NYD] unchallenged in the run-up to the election. Harriet 
Colliander is withdrawing, but she still thinks that she is the 
right and real party leader and that her party executive is the 
right and real party executive. 
  Her resignation is the result of the ballot among members 
that has been held since the extraordinary party congress. The 
votes were counted on Tuesday [21 June]. It emerged that 
Vivianne Franzen and her executive have the support of about 80 
percent of those who took part in the ballot. 
  Given that this is the situation Harriet Colliander has 
decided to give up. She is resigning as chairman of the party 
executive that was elected at the regular party congress in 
early April and will leave politics. She will not participate 
in the election campaign and she will not run for the Riksdag 
this fall. [passage omitted]

  [Text] It has been reported that the decision on Cyprus 
taken at the European Union's [EU] Corfu summit has given the 
green light to full EU membership for south Cyprus and Malta. 
Osman Ertug, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' New York 
envoy, described the development as an unfortunate decision and 
said that it will not help the negotiation process on the island. 
  In his statement to Anatolia Agency, Ertug pointed out that 
the decision will deepen the rift in Cyprus and added: With 
this decision, the EU leaves us no alternatives but to merge 
with Turkey. If south Cyprus merges with the EU, then we have no 
options but to integrate with Turkey.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has left for Adana at the 
invitation of the Association of Young Businessmen. In a 
statement prior to his departure from Ercan Airport, he assessed 
the latest situation on the Cyprus problem. 
  [Begin Denktas recording] The Turkish Cypriot side has done 
its utmost to reach a reconciliation with the Greek Cypriot 
side. We are waiting for UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's report. The Greek Cypriot side's persistent 
initiatives to join the European Union will keep that matter on 
our agenda. We shall closely follow the situation and, 
undoubtedly, we shall not hesitate to take the necessary 
measures together with Fatherland Turkey. 
  The Greek Cypriot newspapers maintain their propaganda 
activities by distorting the views we have expressed in 
self-defense and as a reaction to Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos 
Kliridhis. In particular, they have distorted the views we have 
expressed on the Turkish Resistance Organization. Undoubtedly, 
this is not the first time that the Greek Cypriots, who claim 
that they will establish friendly relations with us, have tried 
to distort our views. Nor is it the first time that they have 
made an effort to create a negative impression in the world 
about the Turkish Cypriots and their leaders. I have followed 
the Greek Cypriot newspapers every day for 40 years. By doing 
so, I am able to determine what they wish to achieve. As far as 
the Greek Cypriot intentions are concerned, what we have read in 
the Greek Cypriot newspapers have not inspired hope in us. We 
hope that the foreign diplomats will closely follow the Greek 
Cypriot newspapers and see how much an opportunity the Turkish 
Cypriots have had to reach a reconciliation. Naturally, we 
cannot find the right way if we are not informed about the Greek 
Cypriot side's views. 
  I wish to recall Rolandhis' views. I wish to reemphasize his 
approach because he made a realistic assessment. I hope that 
the Greek Cypriot leaders will carefully read his assessment. 
They have launched an appalling campaign to rearm themselves. 
Greece will disappoint them once again. However, the entire 
island will suffer if they open the door to catastrophe. I 
called for a face-to-face meeting with Glavkos Kliridhis. I 
still call for such a meeting because it would be very wrong to 
believe that foreign officials will be able to have us reach an 
agreement through their mediation, that is, if the two leaders 
do not meet, or are not in a position to hold talks, or fail to 
meet face-to-face as equals. Kliridhis has continued to avoid 
holding talks with us. I believe that we have many things to 
discuss. In particular, I wish to meet him face-to-face to tell 
him the cost the country may be forced to pay because of their 
rearmament campaign. 
  President Denktas will proceed from Adana to Kahramanmaras. 
He will address the conferences that will be held in the two 
cities on the Cyprus problem. He will return to north Cyprus on 
Wednesday.

  [Text] Lefkosa [Nicosia], June 27 (AA) -- Turkish Republic 
of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] President Rauf Denktas said today that 
a federal solution in Cyprus is not possible any more. 
  He said that the U.N. Security Council was making a great 
error and bringing the two communities together by a superficial 
agreement would lead to an `inevitable disaster.' 
  He was welcoming a delegation of 30 journalists in his 
office 
at the TRNC capital. 
  He recalled that Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis, in 
his speeches to the world, spoke as if they were the sole and 
legal government of Cyprus. 
  `This shows that we are just losing time,' Denktas said. 
  `We have arrived at a turning point and we are obliged to 
make an evaluation of the situation, together with Turkey,' he 
said. 
  Denktas also recalled that former Cyprus envoy of the U.N. 
secretary-general, Hugo Gobi had also said that if the two 
communities are forced to come together under a federation, 
Cyprus would to be another Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  `The Security Council is trying to bring together, by 
superficial means, the two communities, on an island which has 
been in peace for 20 years,' he said.

  [Text] DISI [Democratic Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis and 
AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] Secretary General 
Dhimitrios Khristofias left for Strasbourg this morning. The 
two officials and Liberals Party Chairman Nikolaos Rolandhis 
will participate in a hearing between Greek Cypriot and Turkish 
Cypriot political parties that will be held before the political 
committee of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly. 
  In a statement made to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation 
shortly before leaving for Strasbourg, Matsis said the presence 
of the Greek Cypriot parties was necessary, since Turkish 
Cypriot leaders have also been invited. He added: In this way, 
the Greek Cypriot parties will be able to present the current 
reality 20 years after the continuing occupation. Matsis said 
the political committee's meeting will basically deal with the 
introduction of Lord Finsberg's report on the Cyprus issue, 
adding that within the framework of this evaluation, views will 
be expressed on the overall Cyprus issue and the 
confidence-building measures [CBM's]. 
  Khristofias noted that the belief of all parliamentary 
parties is that nonparliamentary parties should also have been 
invited to express their views to the committee, since Turkish 
Cypriot parties that participate in the pseudoparliament have 
been invited. He said this was not accomplished and added that 
several parties have sent their positions in writing. 
Khristofias stressed that an effort will be made in Strasbourg 
so that the Council of Europe does not set a precedence because 
of the official invitation to the pseudoparliament. He 
described as a weak point the fact that during the hearing each 
party is only allocated 10 minutes to express its views on the 
CBM's and the Cyprus issue in general. 
  An interparty parliamentary delegation is in Strasbourg 
under 
House of Representatives President Alexis Galanos to participate 
in the work of the Council of Europe parliamentary assembly's 
summer session. Deputies Takis Khatzidhimitriou, Dhoros 
Khristodhoulidhis, Rina Katseli, and Nikolaos Rolandhis are part 
of the delegation. The assembly's meeting opened yesterday and 
will conclude on Friday.

  [Text] Increased security measures have been taken at the 
U.S. Embassy in Nicosia following information about a terrorist 
act. Correspondent Petros Konstandinou has the following report: 
  [Begin Konstandinou recording] The U.S. Embassy in Nicosia 
is a target for terrorists. According to CyBC [Cyprus 
Broadcasting Corporation] information, messages from various 
sources have been conveyed to the U.S. Embassy. According to 
these messages, the pro-Iranian Hizballah organization could 
attack. Following these messages, strict instructions were 
given to the embassy's security personnel to take all the 
necessary measures to avoid unpleasant situations. Instructions 
for increased alertness have also been given to the policemen 
who guard the embassy. A police spokesman who we contacted 
refrained from commenting on the information. He only said that 
increased security measures are always taken at the U.S. 
Embassy. A U.S. Embassy spokesman, who we asked to confirm the 
reports that terrorists might attack and measures were being 
taken against that, answered: Today is a day like any other. 
Other sources, though, confirmed that there is increased 
alertness but the measures assumed, he added, are not obvious.

  [Text] Turkey, dragged before the European Court of Human 
Rights for the first time on charges of violating the human 
rights of a Greek-Cypriot refugee, must be held accountable for 
what happens in the occupied north, lawyers told the European 
Court yesterday. 
  Nicosia barrister Akhileas Dhimitriadhis, appearing on 
behalf 
of Kyrenia refugee Titina Loizidhou, and Attorney General 
Mikhalakis Triandafilidhis told the 19-member Grand Chamber of 
the European Court it should waive Turkey's objections and 
examine the facts of the case. 
  They said Turkey, by virtue of its 20-year occupation, 
exercises control over the north. 
  Earlier a member of the European Commission of Human Rights, 
which has also examined the case, told the Court it must uphold 
the Commission's report and examine the substance of the 
complaint. 
  Loizidhou, who launched her campaign in 1989, has accused 
Turkey of stripping her of her fundamental human rights by 
preventing her return to her property in the occupied north. 
  The case was first heard by the Commission under Article 25 
on individual recourse. The Commission declined to rule on 
whether her right to property was violated and the case was 
referred to the European Court by the Cyprus government. 
  Turkey, citing procedural points--including the date when it 
had ratified Article 25 and the reservations it had attached, 
told the European Court yesterday it should not hear the case. 
  It also argued that it should not be party to the 
proceedings 
because there is a different "legal entity" in the occupied 
north.

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos attributed 
the opposition parties' criticism of the government for the 
results of the EU [European Union] summit on Corfu to cowardice 
and ignorance. The opposition parties' criticism of the Greek 
presidency and the results of the EU summit, Venizelos said, is 
a reflection of party cowardice, ignorance, party demagoguery, 
as well as international developments. The public has seen and 
can judge for itself, Venizelos said. He added that being in 
opposition does not mean criticizing the government to win 
points. The opposition, he concluded, is not a simple contract 
which is carried out, but a democratic function.

    [Editorial Report] The 7 June Athens daily TA NEA published 
the results of a poll conducted by the MRB firm between 14 and 
24 May among a nationwide representative sampling of individuals 
over 18 with regard to the embargo imposed by Greece on The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] and other issues. 
  Respondents were asked the following questions: 
  "Taking into account the three conditions posed by Greece 
[renouncing the name of `Macedonia' and the star of Veryina on 
the flag and changing the Preamble of the FYROM Constitution], 
do you believe that the embargo hurt or benefited our country?" 
  A majority of 51.5 percent answered that it benefited 
Greece, 
29.5 percent said it hurt the country, and 19 percent did not 
answer. It should be noted that the largest percentage of 
approval came from Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK] voters 
(69.5 percent), with 56.3 percent of Political Spring supporters 
expressing a positive view. Among New Democracy [ND] voters, the 
rate of approval was 34.5 percent, reaching 35.1 percent among 
Communist Party [KKE] supporters and 39.7 percent among 
Coalition of the Left for Progress followers. 
  "What are Greece's most important problems?" 
  Some 85.1 percent pointed to inflation, 84.4 percent 
mentioned unemployment, 79.4 percent foreign policy, 77 percent 
narcotics, 74.2 percent chose health and social security, and 
69.8 percent opted for education. Again, 60 percent mentioned 
economic development, 55.5 percent pointed to foreign 
immigrants, 55.2 percent said criminality, 47.2 percent 
mentioned pollution and the environment, 46.8 percent opted for 
the functioning of public services, 46.2 percent chose the tax 
system, 38.5 percent mentioned terrorism, and 27.5 percent opted 
for transportation difficulties. 
  When asked to rate the stance of Greece's European Union 
[EU] 
partners regarding Greek foreign policy, 33.1 percent said it is 
"completely wrong," and only 0.9 percent said that it is "quite 
right," with the rest of the respondents falling inbetween. The 
percentage of disapproval was greater among PASOK voters (40 
percent) than in the ND electorate (23 percent). 
  "Did Greece's integration into the EU hurt or benefit the 
country?" 
  Among PASOK supporters, 52.3 percent sait it benefited 
Greece, 12.8 percent said it hurt it, 29.3 percent said it did 
neither, and 5.6 percent did not answer. Among ND voters, 79.8 
percent answered positively, 3.7 percent negatively, 11.7 
percent said it made no difference, and 4.8 percent did not 
answer.

  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou is preparing the 
composition of the new government cabinet which will be 
announced immediately following the Corfu meeting [EU summit]. 
A possible date for the swearing in of the new government 
cabinet is 6 July. 
  Replying to a question on the upcoming government reshuffle, 
government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said: The government 
reshuffle is the exclusive responsibility of the prime minister, 
who is evaluating all possibilities. No one else is 
participating in this process. In order not to waste time on 
scenarios, Venizelos added, I can tell you a few very simple 
things. First, the reshuffle will take place within the time 
limit that was announced from the beginning so that the 
government's pace remains steady. Second, there is no truth to 
rumors of a realignment of ministries or the appointment of 
deputy prime ministers. 
  Replying to other relevant questions, the government 
spokesman said that there could be minor changes in some 
ministries. He also did not rule out some division of 
ministries for better administration.

    [Editorial Report] The implications of the results of the 
12 June European Parliament elections, in which both the 
governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK] and the 
opposition New Democracy [ND] lost ground, were the subject of 
commentaries in the Greek press. 
<H5>  Government Problems Viewed </H5>
  In anticipation of the elections, the 12 June Athens daily 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA ran an article by Bambis Papapanayiotou listing 
the "thorny" postelectoral problems awaiting the PASOK 
government. Foremost among these is the economy, Papapanayiotou 
asserted, noting that a new wave of profit-taking may hit the 
drachma, with devaluation still possible in the future. The 
government must also submit its program for the convergence of 
the Greek economy with that of its European partners; a 
consensus exists that this program will include harsh austerity 
measures. The "unfreezing" of government public works and the 
awarding of the various contracts are another problem, as the 
obvious need for an economic "shot in the arm" will clash with 
the opposing interests of both domestic and foreign large 
economic interests. The government must also make a decision on 
the size and pace of the privatization of state-owned companies. 
  The electoral results will influence the "long march" to the 
1995 presidential elections, Papapanayiotou continued. Since 
PASOK lacks the requisite two-thirds majority in the Chamber of 
Deputies to elect the next president of the republic, a 
presidential majority in the spring of 1995 presupposes a series 
of moves in which Political Spring's 10 parliamentary votes 
might be crucial to PASOK. 
  According to Papapanayiotou, a government reshuffle will 
follow the Euroelections. 
<H5>  PASOK Reaction </H5>
  Following the losses sustained by the two largest parties, 
Viktor Netas commented in the 14 June ELEVTHEROTIPIA that "there 
was no cause for celebration" as some PASOK circles believed. 
While voters expected from the government an analysis of the 
results, Prime Minister Papandreou limited himself to stating 
that "PASOK is again the winner" and noting that "the government 
will continue to implement its program by intensifying the 
pace." However, Netas contended, matters were seen differently 
by a number of PASOK officials. Alternate Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos said that "while results do not put 
the government's stability in doubt, vote losses reveal the 
existence of a communications problem with the electorate." 
Netas further quoted Pangalos as saying that "the people did not 
disapprove of our policies but of our methods and style, blaming 
us for lacking a sense of responsibility and transparency." 
Minister of Industry Kostas Simitis was also cited as 
attributing lower PASOK vote shares to the government's slow 
pace and lack of decisiveness. Deputy Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Yiorgos Papandreou openly said that the electoral 
results showed popular "dissatisfaction" with the government. 
Netas commented that voters, "keenly aware of what they expected 
from PASOK, of what was done and what was not" by the government 
in the eight months of its existence, expressed their feelings 
in the voting booth. 
<H5>  Interpretations Criticized </H5>
  If one were to believe the facile interpretations of 
"voters' 
messages," wrote Themos Anastasiadhis in the 15 June 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Greeks "smacked a PASOK which is (supposedly) 
worthy of governing us but unworthy of representing us 
internationally, (supposedly) expressed their attachment to 
[former ND leader] Konstandinos Mitsotakis as opposed to wicked 
leader Miltiadhis Evert, and showed Political Spring to be a 
`party of government' which must, however, wage a hard battle 
with rising parties like the KKE and the coalition, whose power 
was greatly increased." The electorate, Anastasiadhis continued, 
had no reason to favor PASOK, given the government's lackluster 
performance and Papandreou's obvious inability to carry out his 
duties "as of old." According to Anastasiadhis, the ND's 33 
percent of the vote did not mean a "disapproval" of Miltiadhis 
Evert as his ND opponents are proclaiming, and is not solely due 
to the electorate's switch to smaller parties. In fact, ND 
losses stemmed from the "organized sabotage" by pro-Mitsotakis 
circles against Evert. Evert's poor political discourse and his 
"extraordinary vagueness" facilitated his opponents' task and 
precipitated his "self-destruction." However, Evert "is not 
finished," for he would easily win in a future confrontation 
with a PASOK without Papandreou. 
  Those who believe that the "great winner" was Political 
Spring leader Andonis Samaras are "deluding themselves," 
Anastasiadhis continued. The party scored only 2 points above 
the Coalition and the KKE, failing to prove itself a "party of 
government." Finally, the KKE and the Coalition's "triumphant" 
claim that "bipolarity was defeated" must await the results of 
the next parliamentary elections, Anastasiadhis commented. While 
the Coalition had the advantage of leader Nikos Konstandopoulos' 
seriousness and status, it also benefited from the 
"philanthropy" of the Greek people, who "generously" accorded 
this "hapless" party some seats in the European Parliament, 
Anastasiadhis added with some irony. The KKE's slight gains came 
from disaffected PASOK voters who will likely "return home" in 
the next elections. 
<H5>  Papandreou Presidential Plans </H5>
  PASOK election losses stemmed from a number of causes, wrote 
Stavros Liyeros in the 14 June Athens daily I KATHIMERINI. An 
important one was the electorate's uncertainty about the party's 
future. While the widespread impression that Papandreou will 
jump to the presidency leaving Akis Tsokhatzopoulos to succeed 
him as prime minister caused considerable dissatisfaction in 
PASOK ranks, PASOK losses made it more likely that Papandreou 
will run in the next presidential elections. According to an 
unattributed article in the 14 June I KATHIMERINI citing 
knowledgeable sources, PASOK's "dramatic" losses, which have 
weakened Papandreou's position within the party, will lead him 
to attempt a presidential run. In the present balance of forces 
in the Chamber of Deputies, the election of a president depends 
on an alliance between PASOK and Political Spring, an unlikely 
development given Samaras' reluctance to contribute to a 
prolongation of the present government. For its part, the KKE 
already announced it will reject a Papandreou presidency but 
left open the possibility it would vote for another candidate 
proposed by the majority. This leaves only the ND, whose 
leadership would never cooperate with PASOK in a presidential 
election. At this time, the article concluded, any decisions 
about a presidential candidacy should await the results of the 
October municipal elections, which will permit a better 
evaluation of the electorate's mood. 
<H5>  Discussion in ND </H5>
  According to an unattributed article in the 14 June I 
KATHIMERINI, a 15 June meeting of the ND central committee will 
attempt to define the reasons for the party's poor showing in 
the Euroelections. The daily's list includes the following 
causes: 

  -  The ND did not campaign for Europe and Greece but 
for the party chairman. It supported his modernizing policies, 
which are seemingly not understood by a large segment of the 
party's grass-roots supporters. 
  -  The party was disorganized and 
the electoral commissions failed to perform 
adequately. 
  -  Mitsotakis offered no help and contributed to the 
creation of anti-Evert sentiment. 
  -  The ND entered the electoral 
fray at an inappropriate time, following an electoral 
defeat. 
  -  The poarty suffered from a lack of vision and an 
uncertain political identity. 
  -  ND candidates offered no thing new. 

<H5>  `Bipolarity' Seen Shattered </H5>
  An unattributed article in the 14 June I KATHIMERINI 
commented that the failure of the ND to take advantage of 
PASOK's attrition in popularity means that the "closed cycle" of 
bipolarity, ensuring the two parties' alternation in power, was 
shattered. While this must be seen as just the beginning of a 
process that may be interrupted and reversed in the next 
elections, the gap will widen with time, the article asserted. 
Events will depend on ND internal developments, which may lead 
to a breakup and may increase similar pressures on PASOK when 
its succession problem will have to be tackled.

  [Text] After the Korean peninsula, Somalia, and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, this time around the assignment of Turkish 
troops to duty in Azerbaijan is on the agenda. Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller is getting ready to call an extraordinary session 
of the parliament in order to include Turkish troops in the 
peace force envisaged to be sent to the region to find a 
peaceful solution to the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. The aim 
is to somewhat impede Russia's fast- growing influence in the 
region. 
  [Unidentified reporter] According to a statement by the True 
Path Party, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller submitted her letter to 
the president of the parliament asking for a mandate from the 
Turkish Grand National Assembly to enable the Turkish troops to 
serve in Azerbaijan. For this purpose, the Prime Minister will 
call an extraordinary session of the parliament, which is 
formally going into recess tomorrow. 
  Ciller is asking for the following mandate: 
  1. The presence of the Turkish troops in the CSCE peace 
force to be assigned to duty in the Azerbaijani lands occupied 
by Armenians. 
  2. Establishing a base in Turkey to provide logistical 
support to this peace force. 
  It is expected that this base will most probably be located 
in Erzurum. Russia wants its military troops to serve as a 
peace force for the solution of the Azerbaijani-Armenian 
conflict. Its rationale is that it will take a long time for 
the CSCE troops to arrive in the region. Russia is claiming 
that it will take almost ten days for the CSCE peace force to 
arrive in the region if there is a cease-fire between the sides. 
To undercut this argument, a group of CSCE countries, including 
Turkey, wants to keep a force in Erzurum similar to the Hammer 
Force in Incirlik. Russia is favoring one-sided military 
intervention and the dispatching of troops to prevent the 
clashes in the Caucasus. It is attaining its goal step by step. 
For example, Russian troops are continuing to establish 
themselves in the region to ensure the continuation of the 
cease-fire between the separatist Abkhazian militants and 
Georgian troops. Russia has received no mandate from the UN or 
CSCE. Moscow is entering the region by direct agreements it 
concluded with Georgia and the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic.

  [Text] It has been announced that the CSCE delegation, 
which will oversee the cease-fire between Azerbaijan and Armenia 
and which will observe withdrawal of troops, the normalization 
of transportation, and the return of refugees to their homes, is 
in no way a military delegation. 
  In reply to a question on the subject, Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Ferhat Ataman recalled that a peace plan has been 
drafted within the framework of the CSCE Minsk Group in an 
effort to resolve the armed conflict between Azerbaijan and 
Armenia. In accordance with this plan, Ataman explained, once a 
cease-fire is secured, an observer delegation to be comprised of 
CSCE countries will oversee the cease-fire. 
  Ataman declared: The observer delegation will be composed of 
military experts and civilian officials from CSCE countries. 
The task to be fulfilled by the delegation will in no way be a 
military operation. The personnel to be assigned to this 
mission do not comprise a military force or unit, but rather an 
observer delegation. The observer delegation is not assigned 
with the task of protecting the peace or resorting to force to 
this end. Moreover, the members of the delegation will not bear 
arms. 
  Ataman also noted that preparations are under way to 
establish a logistical support center in Erzurum to serve the 
delegation to be sent to the conflict area.

  [Text] Ankara--Russia's call for talks on the new rules 
Ankara will put into effect in connection with Turkey's straits 
on 1 July has been rejected once again. According to the 
Turkish Foreign Ministry, the delegations of the two countries 
met on the matter and reiterated their views in Ankara 
yesterday. The Turkish delegation briefed the Russian officials 
on the new rules, but avoided a debate on the matter during the 
meeting, which was held at Russia's request. 
  Meanwhile, Ankara has welcomed Russia's signing of the NATO 
Partnership for Peace. Turkish Foreign Ministry officials have 
said that Turkey welcomed Russia's move to sign the agreement, 
which will pave the ground for close cooperation between the two 
sides. Regarding the decision that the relations between Russia 
and NATO should not be concealed, the officials asserted: "That 
factor is very important to inspire confidence in countries, 
which may be troubled by the relations between NATO and Russia."

  [Text] Ankara, June 27 (AA) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Ferhat Ataman said on Monday [27 June] that a demonstration of 
the separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
organization held in Frankfurt has turned to a terrorist 
activity. Ataman said the demonstration was a kind of terrorist 
activity in spite of the guarantee that the German Government 
has given adding that Ankara felt disappointment on the issue. 
Ataman said necessary initiations were made in Ankara, Bonn and 
Frankfurt on the issue. He said "we think Germany's decision to 
ban PKK should not be diluted and this terror organization 
should not be encouraged" adding that "we will be in close 
connection with the German officials." 
  During the demonstration, separatists carried a picture of 
the leader of PKK and pieces of clothes symbolizing colors of 
the separatist terrorist organization. 
  Turkey earlier expressed pleasure to see determination of 
Germany to extradite supporters of terrorists who violated 
German laws.

who is currently visiting Turkey as the guest of Gen. Dogan 
Gures, chief of the General Staff, is meeting with officials in

  [Text] Istanbul, June 28 (A.A.) -- The Istanbul Chamber of 
Commerce (ITO) on Monday [27 June] signed a trade and 
cooperation agreement with Cuba's Chamber of Commerce 
contravening a 32-year U.S. embargo on the country. 
  Porfirio Mederos, deputy chief [vice president] of Cuba's 
Chamber of Commerce, speaking during a visit to ITO said Turkey 
should attend the Havana fair to open up to South American 
countries. But it was unclear whether Mederos was speaking 
solely about South American countries or Cuba -- Cuba is a North 
American island 90 miles (144 kms) south of the United States. 
  Mederos called on Turkish businessmen to invest in Cuba. 
"With a trade and economic agreement," Mederos said, "Turkey and 
Cuba will reach the desired level of trade." 
  The Cuban delegation will visit various installations in 
Istanbul before returning to their county.

<F P=106> [Report by Galip Ridvanoglu] </F>
  [Text] Diyarbakir-The two, Khaki colored, convertible Land 
Rovers sped past our bus heading towards Mardin. Four villagers 
were seated on top of one of the vehicles among heavily armed 
gendarmerie soldiers. As we watched them go by we noticed their 
hands were tied behind their backs. But they could not see us, 
for their eyes were covered with rags. Blindfolded, they were 
clearly being taken for interrogation. 
  Heading towards one of the seven makeshift refugee camps set 
up in northern Iraq to accommodate some 12,000 refugees, our 
group which was escorting a delegation from the Turkish Human 
rights Association was constantly accompanied by the sound of 
blasts coming down from the mountains. 
  Explosions could be heard from miles away, signalling a new 
operation. Perhaps there will a new communique from the 
Governor's office on yet another victory against militants of 
the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
  The explosions, however, are also being attributed to other 
things. At the Association branch office in Diyarbakir, a wall 
gazette is full of pictures. Pictures of burned down and 
destroyed houses. Pictures of civilians with bodies covered 
with bruises and burn marks. 
  Asking the local activists on what they are, we get a blunt 
reply, "the houses are those which have been destroyed by 
security forces. The people are those who have been tortured." 
About 12,000 people living along the border have already fled 
into northern Iraq where they are scattered in seven separate 
camps. Everyone is scared. 
  Among the scared are human rights activists. Association 
Chairman Akin Birdal suggests we move together and eat in the 
same place. "To avoid mystery killings," he explains. 
  On the first day of the fact-finding mission, a decision is 
taken to keep the group together and "avoid complications." 
Numbering around 30 people and made up of human rights 
activists and journalists, our group headed for the border some 
300 kilometers away. Stopped ten times at security check points 
along the road, we are constantly surrounded by the remains of 
petroleum tankers. 
  Following the Gulf War, the road has been empty. There is 
hardly any traffic now and the sanctions on Iraq have hurt the 
local economy most. 
  A police officer explains, "this situation has helped the 
PKK. Most of the unemployed youngsters are now heading for the 
mountains." Custom officials tell us that two to three thousand 
trucks were crossing the border before the sanctions. Now, even 
the customs crossing point is empty. "If things go on this way, 
the whole region will be empty," one customs official interjects. 
  Immediately on the other side of the border we are greeted 
by 
a Kurdish border policeman. "Welcome to Kurdistan," he says, 
standing before a signpost saying the same thing. 
  Close to the border post is the vast mountain of Cudi which 
ranges from Turkey into Iraq and has been used over the years as 
a crossing point by PKK militants. Mount Cudi is smoking. 
"Turkish planes hit it again this morning" one Peshmerge 
explains. 
  In Zakho about 200 Turkish Kurds are on hunger strike. "They 
are bombing our villages," a middle age villager says. "We want 
to live like human beings," he adds. 
  The delegation then moves on to a camp where about 2,000 
refugees who have fled Turkey are housed. Despite previous 
statements by Turkey that the migration is only a PKK ploy, the 
first thing which attracts our attention is the crowded number 
of women and children. 
  The situation in the Sheranishe and Beheri camps just on the 
slopes of the Zerkan mountains astonishes members of the 
delegation. Suddenly there are too many people. More than 
10,000 villagers are now there and about half of them are 
children. Complaints are similar. Stories are almost 
identical. Some complain of being forced to join the village 
guards and losing their villages when they refused. Others say 
their settlements were bombed. The most common complaints are 
related to health and nutrition problems. There is a demand for 
more assistance from the United Nations. 
  "We were forces to move here because of the security 
operations," explains an elderly man. "They bombed and 
destroyed our villages." 
  Following the visit to three separate camps, a Turkish 
officer at the Habur border gate tells us there are 4,000 PKK 
terrorists on Mount Cudi. "We are conducting operations on the 
mountain every day," he says. "We have no day or night. It is 
very difficult." 
  In the evening, we hear cannons pounding the mountain once 
again. Members of the delegation go silent as they listen. The 
roads at night are still dangerous. Nothing goes by but for 
military vehicles. Most officers insist we do not continue. 
"It is too dangerous," one of them says. It is in contrast to 
official statements made back in Ankara that Turkey has full 
control throughout the region. 
  At one military post, where we are hosted while waiting for 
a 
fully equipped escort convoy, we chat with officers. They 
believe the problem in the Southeast can only be solved through 
peaceful methods. 
  One officer says they have identified 2,500 PKK militants in 
Mardin by name. "But in the past two years, we could only get 
some of them. People forced to migrate are joining the 
organization." 
  Another officer interjects, "peaceful methods are a must." 
Two of the four villagers on the Landrover are elderly and in 
no way do they resemble terrorists. Members of the delegation 
are in pain, knowing they cannot do anything. Two women on the 
bus wipe away their tears. If the villagers are crying as well, 
there is no way to know. Their eyes are blindfolded. They 
cannot even see that someone cares. 
  These days, the scene everywhere in the southeast is 
similar. 
There is only military traffic on the roads at night. During 
the day, one can easily hear the blades of helicopters chopping 
through the air. Echoes of faraway explosions can be heard. 
And now, becoming a part of the natural scene, is the smoke. 
The mountains of the Southeast are smoking....

  [Text] Diyarbakir -- State terrorism knows no bounds. 
State forces, on the pretext of cutting off logistics support 
to guerrillas, are evacuating villages, torching and pulling 
down houses, imposing food blockades on villages lasting months, 
and burning forests. And now they are torching crops. This 
operation aims to force the people, who face hunger, to 
emigrate. And it has intensified in the past week. Thirty 
villages in the Kulp-Hazro-Silvan triangle, some of which were 
torched before, were torched again in the past four days. Along 
with the villages, cultivated fields, orchards, and vegetable 
gardens are reportedly also being torched, and damage amounting 
to billions of Turkish lira is being caused, preventing 
villagers from returning. 
<H5>  The Kulp-Hazro-Silvan Triangle Is in Flames </H5>
  Thirty villages in the Kulp-Hazro-Silvan triangle in 
Diyarbakir have been in flames for the past four days. A few 
houses left standing after the last torching and villages 
evacuated by the state forces are also being torched. And crops 
are being torched to prevent the villagers from returning. As 
part of the crop-torching operation, nearly 2,000 donums [one 
donum equals 940 sq. meters or one-fourth of an acre] of fields 
were torched by the state forces in villages in Kulp District. 
  The villages of Temira, Goderne, Cews, Barin, Hedika, 
Savusa, 
Male Hake, Male Repin, and Male Cagle in Kulp District, 
inhabited by the Hevedan clan, were torched and all the 
cultivated fields destroyed. 
  The few houses and crops remaining in the villages of 
Uckuyu, 
Inkaya, Araska, Kanika, Giresor, and Kerka in Kulp District 
after the last torching were again torched to prevent the return 
of villagers. All the cultivated fields belonging to these 
villages were torched. 
  Nercik (Karabulak), Hinze, Grindis, Kocika (partially), 
Beyrok (Kuruagac), Hacuka, Delim, Hasanardik, Kegilbank, 
Zevgesor, Panak, Dikdir, Gomanek (Comlekci) hamlet of Dimilya 
(Baloglu), Fikre hamlet of Cumar (Uzunova), and Arketin have 
reportedly been torched. Woodland on the Serefka, Giresor, Pora, 
and Pirebi Mountains, between Kulp's Eylul Mountain and the 
gendarmerie station in Duzce, was also torched by the soldiers. 
<H5>  The Villages Have Been Placed Under Blockade </H5>
  The villages of Temira, Goderne, Cews, Barin, Hedika, 
Savusa, 
Male Hake, Male Rapin, Male Cagle, Uckuyu, Inkaya, Araska, 
Kanika, Giresor, Kerka, Mercik (Karabulak), Hinze, Girindis, 
Kocika, Beyrok (Kuruagac), Hacuka, Delim, Hasanardik, Kegilbank, 
Zevgesor, Panak, Dikdir, Dimilya (Baloglu) and its hamlet 
Gomanek (Comlekci), Cumar (Uzunova) and its hamlet Fikre, and 
Arketin located in the Kulp-Hazro-Silvan triangle have been 
placed under military blockade. Entrance and exit to these 
villages has been banned. 
<H5>  The Villagers Are Being Detained </H5>
  Many of the villagers whose houses and crops were torched by 
the state forces have been placed under detention. With the 
military blockade of the villages since Wednesday [15 June], no 
information on the detainees is available. Local sources say 
many villagers were detained. 
<H5>  Fields, Pastures, and Forests Were Torched in Hazro </H5>
  The state forces that raided the villages in Hazro District 
and torched houses also burned the villagers' fields to prevent 
them from returning. Since the start of the week, 8,000 donums 
of cultivated land, pasture, and forest have been torched in the 
villages of Hazro District. While pastures and vineyards near 
the town of Hazro were torched, the trees around the old police 
post in Hazro were cut down for security purposes. 
  The gendarmeries attached to Hazro Gendarmerie Command have 
been torching the cultivated fields of Bazmar (Bayirduzu), 
Cirnoki, Grie, Salate, and Pahnaz (Agirti) in Hazro District 
since 13 June. Villagers said the soldiers torched nearly 8,000 
donums of cultivated fields, causing damage amounting to 30 
billion Turkish lira. 
  The residents of the district said the vineyard near the 
newly built gendarmerie post outside Hazro and vineyards and 
pastures in Sinora Region were torched by soldiers for security 
reasons and that the woodland in Diburi Region in the 
mountainous part of Hazro was also torched. 
  Indicating that poplar and walnut trees around the old 
police 
station in Hazro were cut down by the gendarmerie, residents 
said they were under pressure to cut down the trees around the 
cemetery and added: "The soldiers demanded that we cut down the 
trees between the cemetery and the river. We did not accept 
this. The soldiers are responsible for the fires in the fields, 
pastures, and orchards in recent days. Some villages are empty 
but the crops in the fields are still being torched to prevent 
the villagers from returning to their homes. The soldiers were 
also responsible for torching the woodland near the town some 
days ago." 
  Village guards and soldiers torched the crops of villagers 
in 
Herbelus (Beybagi) in Batman's Kozluk District after they 
refused to serve as village guards. Soldiers and guards from 
the same village raided the village on 16 June and torched 
nearly 50 donums of lentil and wheat fields belonging to 
villagers who refused to serve as village guards. Some 25 
donums belonged to Sakir Adli. The lentils and wheat were 
reportedly ruined. Many villagers, whose crops were burned 
because they refused to serve as village guards, have reportedly 
started to leave the village. Over half of Herbelus' 50 
householders are refusing to serve as village guards. 
<H5>  Suspicious Fire in Diyarbakir </H5>
  Fire flared on 18,000 donums of barley and wheat fields 
belonging to Abdullah Ileri, a resident of Cebbar in Diyarbakir 
District, on 16 June. The fire, which started at 0900, spread 
quickly over a wide area. Despite villagers' efforts to put it 
out, the fire raged and was not put out until the evening. 
Firefighters arrived three hours after the fire started. The 
fire reportedly caused billions of lira of material damage and 
destroyed Abdullah Ileri's 18,000 donums of cultivated land. 
  Saying that six major fires raged in fields between 
Diyarbakir-Ergani and Diyarbakir-Siverek in the past week, 
destroying nearly 75,000 domuns of land, the villagers said it 
was no coincidence; the fires were set intentionally.

  [Text] The Ankara State Security Court has launched an 
investigation in connection with the first congress of the 
People's Democracy Party [Halkin Demokrasi Partisi--HADEP]. 
According to information received by a TRT correspondent from 
Nusret Demiral, chief prosecutor of the Ankara State Security 
Court, an investigation was started on the grounds that 
propaganda against the nation was conducted during the HADEP 
congress yesterday. Pointing out that slogans in favor of the 
terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization were 
voiced during the congress, Demiral noted: We will investigate 
whether or not this party is a front organization. Demiral 
remarked that the transcripts of voice and video cassettes 
recorded during the congress will also be studied within the 
framework of the investigation. 
  Meanwhile, Interior Minister Nahit Mentese announced that 
criminal charges will be filed with regard to the first HADEP 
congress. In a news conference in Istanbul's Yalova District, 
Mentese said that HADEP was established to replace the Democracy 
Party, which was banned by the Constitutional Court. Mentese 
noted that the statements made in favor of the PKK and Apo [nom 
de guerre for PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan] during the congress 
constitute a crime and criminal charges will be filed in this 
connection. He declared: Our country and nation are 
indivisible. No one will be able to divide them. 
  Mentese explained that the Kurds in Turkey possess all 
rights, there is no ethnic discrimination between citizens of 
Turkish, Kurdish, Circassian, or Albanian origin, and everyone 
is a first- class citizen. The interior minister added: The 
Kurds may be second-class citizens in Iraq; but, in our country, 
they are first-class citizens. 
  In reply to a question, Mentese said that the necessary 
procedures have been started to convert Yalova into a province.

  [Text] Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand 
National Assembly, has declared that there is no longer any 
alternative to European democracy. Cindoruk returned to Turkey 
after participating in the third plenum of the Black Sea 
Economic Cooperation Assembly. 
  In a news conference at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, Cindoruk 
said that during the meeting, which was attended by the 
parliamentary speakers of 40 countries, Europe established a 
consensus on democracy. He said: 
  [Begin Cindoruk recording] Democracy is being consolidated 
in Europe. There are countries in Europe which have embraced 
democracy and have no difficulties in implementing it, as well 
as countries, which are in the process of adopting democracy. 
This process must be accelerated and a convergence of laws and 
institutions must be achieved. We are now seeing that human 
rights have ceased to be a national legal issue. Human rights 
are no longer a country's internal affairs. Especially in 
Europe, they have become a common law regulated by the 
countries' joint laws and agreements. Therefore, no country can 
consider itself independent on the subject of human rights or 
regard this matter its internal affair. [end recording] 
  Cindoruk pointed out that it is very important to secure 
agreement among the parties if the constitutional amendments are 
to be enacted. He criticized the fact that members of the 
Democracy Party, which has been banned, participated in a 
demonstration against Turkey in Germany. 
  [Begin Cindoruk recording] They made a grave mistake. I 
denounce the fact that they demonstrated against Turkey. They 
say that they will participate in politics in Turkey. Their 
action will disappoint the Turkish public, which is sensitive. 
Let us resolve our problems in Turkey. I do not resent those 
who apply to an international court; but, I say that if they are 
to engage in politics, the forum for that is Turkey. Let them 
come here and engage in politics. The laws and the executors of 
the law are not against them. Everyone is implementing the law 
and the rule of law is in effect. If an error is committed, the 
courts will rectify it. The State Security Court is a reliable 
court. [end recording]

  [Text] Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime 
minister, has said that he does not believe it is politically 
right for him to meet in Brussels the former deputies of the 
Democracy Party [DEP] that has been banned by the 
Constitutional Court. He added: I prefer to meet them in Turkey 
regarding an issue that concerns Turkey. Yasar Kefeli from the 
Turkish Radio and Television team in Brussels reports the 
following: 
  [Begin Kefeli recording] Karayalcin replied to reporters' 
questions aboard the plane on his way to Brussels. In reply to 
a question on what his stand would be in the event the former 
DEP deputies who are in Brussels requested to meet with him, 
Karayalcin said: I do not feel the need to discuss the DEP 
issue with others. I, on principle, am ready to meet with 
everyone who expresses a wish to meet with me. I, however, do 
not believe that this is right from the political viewpoint. I 
am the Turkish deputy prime minister. I am ready to meet with 
anyone to discuss any issue in Turkey. 
  In reply to another question on whether this statement could 
be interpreted as a refusal to meet the former DEP deputies in 
Brussels, Karayalcin said: Such a meeting is not in my program, 
nor is it in my thoughts. I would prefer to meet in Turkey with 
DEP or other deputies to discuss issues concerning Turkey. 
  Karayalcin stated that discussions by the Council of Europe 
Parliamentary Assembly concerning Turkey might also be discussed 
during his contacts in Brussels. 
  In reply to a question on the European Union [EU] membership 
of the Greek Cypriot sector and Malta and Turkey's stand on the 
issue, Karayalcin said that Turkey has established its relations 
with the EU much earlier and that it has priority regarding its 
membership application. He added: In my capacity as the deputy 
prime minister of my country I do not think it is appropriate to 
discuss Turkey's application together with the other issues. 
Turkey's application should be discussed as a separate issue 
carrying its own weight. Karayalcin noted that the EU wish for a 
peaceful solution of the Cyprus problem on the one hand and its 
view of the Greek Cypriot administration as a separate state on 
the other might raise the timetable issue put forward by certain 
sectors in Cyprus and added: This is totally wrong from the 
viewpoint of Turkey's security and peace in eastern 
Mediterranean. I think that this is a great obstacle for the EU. 
  Karayalcin will meet with Philippe Busquin, president of the 
Francophone Socialist Party, in Brussels this afternoon. He 
will later meet with Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback. 
Karayalcin will meet with EU Commission President Jacques 
Delors, Commission Deputy President Sir Leon Britten, and 
Belgian Vice Prime Minister Melchior Wathelet tomorrow. [end

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Ireland's Other Agenda"] </F>
  [Text] The Anglo-Irish declaration signed by John Major 
and Albert Reynolds last December was based, in part, on a 
premise which has proved to be completely false. In private, 
ministers insisted that the IRA was operationally weak and that 
the Republican movement would find it extremely difficult to 
renew its campaign of violence once a ceasefire was declared. 
The risks involved in wooing Sinn Fein, it was argued, were 
worth taking in order to exploit this opportunity. 
  The IRA's activities in the past six months have made a 
mockery of these extravagant notions. Its campaign against 
civilians and troops has continued mercilessly; in March, its 
mortar assault on Heathrow took the security service completely 
by surprise. Soon after, an army helicopter was brought down by 
IRA fire in Co Armagh. Further "spectaculars" have been promised 
by Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams. On the other side of the 
sectarian divide, meanwhile, Loyalist violence has intensified 
horribly. The Loughin Island massacre nine days ago was a 
brutal reminder that the Loyalist gangs are no less murderous 
than their Republican adversaries. Even if Sinn Fein announces 
a temporary ceasefire in the next few days -- as some predict -- 
the paramilitary menace will remain. 
  The bloodshed of the last six months is clear evidence that 
the existing programme of Anglo-Irish diplomacy is not enough. 
Constitutional reform in the North -- leading to the 
establishment of an administrative assembly by the end of the 
year -- should now be at the heart of Mr Major's Irish strategy. 
But so too should a full review of the security options open to 
ministers. 
  Too often, the debate on Irish security is reduced to a 
sterile argument between the supporters and opponents of 
selective internment. In fact, this is only one of many options 
which ministers should be investigating -- and by no means the 
most important. There is still scope for improved cross-border 
arrangements, for instance. British helicopters and cars should 
be given greater freedom to pursue suspects into the Republic; 
the long-planned extradition reforms in the South should be 
completed as swiftly as possible; and liaison between the Royal 
Ulster Constabulary [RUC] and the Republic's security forces 
should be strengthened. 
  As we report on today's Agenda page, there are also a number 
of basic legislative and procedural steps which could be taken 
to increase the pressure on the paramilitaries. Telephone 
intercept evidence could be made admissible in court, as it is 
in America. The existing powers of specialised investigators to 
interrogate suspects involved in terrorism and of the state to 
prosecute those who refuse to answer questions could be widened. 
The Italian "supergrass" system -- much admired by the RUC -- 
should be further explored by the British Government. 
  The potential benefits of these proposals must, of course, 
be 
weighed against their potential impact upon civil liberties. 
But few ministers have shown a real interest in such questions 
when they have been raised by Unionist politicians or RUC 
officers. The Government remains committed to the belief that 
the problems of Ulster can be resolved by Anglo-Irish diplomacy, 
and to a fatalistic acceptance that the IRA can never be beaten. 
The first assumption is manifestly mistaken; and the second, 
contrary to ministers assertions, has yet truly to be tested.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Marsh and Peter John in London and Richard </F>
Tomkins in New York: "G-7 Faces Hard Time To Keep the Lid on the 
Dollar"] 
  [Text] The Group of Seven leading industrial nations has 
11 days to stop the dollar drama turning into a crisis. 
  As G-7 leaders approach their annual summit in Naples at the 
end of next week, they want to avoid any perception in financial 
markets they are unable to arrest the fall against the D-Mark 
and Japanese yen of the world's leading trading currency. But 
on the evidence of last week, the G-7 -- the United States, 
Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada -- will have 
its work cut out. 
  Heavy intervention on Friday [24 June] by most of the G-7 
central banks, backed by central banks in other European 
countries, failed to lift the dollar from its lacklustre 
position against other main currencies. 
  On Friday night in New York the dollar closed at Y100.525 
against the yen and DMl.584 against the D-Mark, below the levels 
at which the central banks first intervened earlier that day. 
Since the first week of June, the dollar has slipped about 5 
yen -- last week briefly passing under Y100 and 8 pfennigs. 
  Many investors believe Friday's efforts to buy dollars led 
by 
the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to be repeated early this 
week, perhaps today, in a further show of strength to prop the 
ailing currency. 
  But in both the United States and Europe, currency analysts 
said negative sentiment toward the dollar had taken root. "I 
don't think anyone wants to hold a buck right now," said a 
dealer at a Japanese bank in New York. Mr Stephen Lewis, 
research director at London Bond Broking, a securities dealer, 
said: "The dominant mood in the market is that the dollar has 
further to fall." 
  Behind these thoughts is that the Fed is judged unwilling to 
consider a rise in short-term interest rates to defend the 
dollar. Such a move could jeopardise the U.S. recovery, the main 
drive behind signs of stronger economic conditions throughout 
the industrialised world. 
  Meanwhile, the perception has grown that the Bundesbank is 
unlikely to continue cutting short-term borrowing rates, because 
of signs of economic pick-up in Germany. 
  As a result, many think the gap between short-term interest 
rates in Germany and the United States is about to widen, after 
months of general narrowing. At present three-month inter-bank 
rates in Germany are about 4.9 per cent and in the United States 
about 4.6 per cent -- the further they move apart the more 
incentive investors have to hold D-Marks. 
  Also holding back the dollar against the yen is the large 
Japanese current account surplus with the United States and lack 
of progress in trade talks between the two countries. 
  Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the 
U.S. 
investment bank, said last Friday's intervention had at least 
succeeded in dispelling doubts about the intention of U.S. 
authorities and G-7 partners to quell currency instability. 
"It's hardly the last word: there is likely more action to 
come," Mr Lipsky said. 
  But the chances of success of further rounds of intervention 
are open to question. One European monetary official said much 
Friday's support for the dollar was "pretty much token," coming 
after years of general lack of concern in the United States 
about dollar weakness. "Unless the Americans back up 
intervention with a policy action (an increase in interest 
rates) the moves won't have much impact," he said. 
  A further question mark can be raised over the willingness 
of 
the Bundesbank to join large-scale operations to boost the 
dollar. Any action by the German central bank to buy dollars 
for D-Marks risks an increase in the German money supply, 
playing havoc with the M3 money-supply calculations the bank 
uses to judge economic conditions. For this reason there is 
"general scepticism about the Bundesbank's willingness" to 
intervene, according to Mr Gerry Holtham, chief European 
economist at Lehman Brothers. 
  Nervousness over the dollar is expected to continue to spill 
over to world bond and equity markets, which were fragile last 
week on fears about how an increase in U.S. interest rates could 
endanger signs of global economic recovery. 
  Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, 
said even if U.S. borrowing rates went up, the same would not 
necessarily have to happen in Europe. But he added: "In 13 
years I have never seen a situation where the bond markets were 
more lacking in confidence than they are now." 
  He said pressure on the dollar was exaggerated by many 
investors' over-enthusiasm for the U.S. currency last year. 
They had built up large stocks of dollars and were now-keen to 
sell. And he believed that although Japanese institutional 
investors had cash to invest, many had seen the value of their 
overseas holdings whittled away by currency shifts and were no 
longer prepared to buy foreign exchange assets. "The Japanese 
are the buyers of last resort and if they don't come in (to 
support currencies) this can cause problems," Mr Bootle said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hard Slog in Russia"] </F>
  [Text] The government of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin is making 
an unexpectedly valiant effort to stabilise the Russian economy. 
But the effort could easily fail and does, in any case, still 
fall far short of true stabilisation. If Mr Chernomyrdin is 
indeed a man with whom the West can do business, it makes sense 
to do the decisive business now. To wait may be to lose the 
opportunity. 
  As former head of a large Soviet gas enterprise, Gasprom, Mr 
Chernomyrdin has the political clout lacked by the younger 
reformers, Mr Yegor Gaydar and Mr Boris Fedorov. What he lacked 
was their understanding. But he does seem to have come a long 
way, particularly for someone who proclaimed early this year 
that the era of "market romanticism" was over. It was he, after 
all, who wrote in the FT [FINANCIAl TIMES] last month that "it 
is vitally important that every member of the Russian Government 
fully understands that a strong ruble is the indispensable 
condition for the revival of the Russian economy, and the 
Russian state as a whole." 
  So far has the government come that Mr Michel Camdessus, 
managing director of the International Monetary Fund, was 
persuaded in March to advance the $1.5bn second tranche of the 
systemic transformation facility. Negligible in itself, this 
sum was an important sign of confidence in the Russian 
Government. Nor has that confidence appeared misplaced. 
Monetary policy has been tight, while inflation has been kept 
down -- to just 6.8 per cent in May, following 10 per cent a 
month between February and April. 
  Unfortunately, partly because of a 25 per cent decline in 
industrial output since last year, government figures show tax 
collection 15 per cent below budget in the first quarter. The 
deficit has been kept under control mainly by non-payment of 
spending obligations, measures that are neither desirable nor 
sustainable in the long term. Meanwhile, there are strong 
pressures for more spending from lobbies for the military, the 
military- industrial complex, agricultural interests (strongly 
represented in the Duma) and the northern territories. 
  The limited success so far may well not last. But it would 
not be good enough, even if it were to. Output has already 
fallen so far that successful stabilisation might bring a strong 
turnround in the economy next year. But first there needs to be 
not just a prolongation of the present long drawn out squeeze, 
but a serious effort to break inflationary expectations. 
  What is needed, in fact, is true stabilisation. That could 
be achieved through a programme to peg the exchange rate, 
combined with elimination of inflationary financing of the 
budget deficit. More funding would be needed than is now 
available. Much of it could be raised domestically, some in 
higher domestic revenue and some in domestic borrowing, but a 
precondition would be more Western finance. Some 4-5 per cent 
of Russian gross domestic product in external assistance, for 
two or three years, might do the trick. The bill for the West 
would be perhaps $14bn a year. 
  Judged by aid budgets this is a large sum. Judged by the 
more relevant standard of military spending, it is small. What 
needs to be understood is that Russia is not merely an aid 
problem. Stabilising its economy offers probably the most 
significant current opportunity to make the world a better 
place. Mr Chernomyrdin's determination offers the West yet 
another chance to help, but it may not last. While such an 
opportunity may come again, it would be sheer folly for Western 
leaders to act on that assumption.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Two days after the European Union 
[EU] summit in Corfu the Federal Government has started 
exploratory talks to present a generally acceptable candidate 
for the succession of EU Commission President Jacques Delors in 
time for the special summit in Brussels on 15 July. After the 
meeting of the leading Christian Democratic Union bodies in Bonn 
on Monday [27 June], Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that now he 
will start his "efforts" to find a candidate who is acceptable 
to all 12 member states. At the Corfu summit Belgian Prime 
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who was supported by 11 member 
countries, failed to be elected because of Great Britain's veto. 
  The chancellor must settle the conflict, since Germany will 
take over the EU Council presidency from Greece on 1 July. The 
veto of British Prime Minister John Major met largely with 
approval in London, also among the opposition and in the 
Conservative Party, which is deeply split concerning European 
issues. The Dutch Government is annoyed because Kohl and French 
President Francois Mitterrand supported Dehaene, and thus did 
not give Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers a chance to become 
the new Commission president. 
  Kohl is still firmly determined to present Delors' successor 
at the constituting session of the European Parliament on 19 
July. The chancellor did not comment on whether Bonn and Paris 
will continue to support Dehaene. In Corfu Major had said 
concerning Dehaene: "We will not agree today, tomorrow, or in 
four weeks." 
  On Monday, government spokesman Dieter Vogel explained that 
the Federal Government will try "intensively" to find a 
candidate who is acceptable to everyone. The chancellor and 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) 
will sound out the situation in many talks with other EU members 
over the next few weeks. Asked whether Bonn has distanced 
itself from Dehaene, Vogel said: "Just wait a bit. I cannot 
see that the candidate of the 11 is not a suitable candidate, 
except for the government of one country."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Following the failure to choose a

Delors, the Federal Government is obviously distancing itself to 
a certain extent from its previous support of Belgian Prime

the next three weeks until the special summit in Brussels on 15 
July, Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel told the press on Monday 
[27 June]. One cannot yet see what the solution could be like. 
In a newspaper interview Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free 
Democratic Party), however, had praised Dehaene once again as a 
"dedicated European" and added that the European Union needs "a 
doer." Dehaene had failed to be chosen because of the British 
veto at the Corfu summit.

Transportation Ministry in Bonn announced on Wednesday [22 June] 
after negotiations with Havanna were concluded, the new 
agreement regulates, among other things, the freedom of

shipping. An important part of the agreement is the fact that 
ships of the partners to the agreement are treated like the 
respective country's own ships regarding access to ports and the 
use of services. In addition, the freedom of establishment is 
ensured for shiping companies.

  [Excerpts] Bonn/Magdeburg (DPA) -- Following the 
Saxony-Anhalt Landtag elections, the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] intends to form a minority government. The party 
presidium in Bonn specifically welcomed the statement of SPD top 
candidate Reinhard Hoeppner to run for the office of 
minister-president. The SPD federal presidium said the SPD 
would now discuss a joint policy program with Alliance 90/Greens 
as soon as possible. There would be no coalition talks with the 
Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. The Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU] was "invited to meet its political responsibility 
and support a government formed by Reinhard Hoeppner," the SPD 
Presidium said in Bonn. [passage omitted] 
  Hoeppner said in Bonn he would resume talks with the parties 
represented in the Landtag on the support of a government led by 
the SPD. Earlier today, he had said: "For me there are only 
two government models -- either a grand coalition with the CDU 
under the leadership of the SPD, or a red-green minority 
government tolerated by the CDU." At the same time, the SPD top 
candidate had stressed that he would also let himself be elected 
minister-president with the votes of the PDS, which will in the 
future be the third strongest force in the Landtag. In the 
evening, Hoeppner answered a relevant question [on a coalition 
with the PDS] in the negative. [passage omitted] 
  Chairman Roland Claus of the Saxony-Anhalt PDS said on 27 
June that his party would not vote for Hoeppner as 
minister-president if he [Hoeppner] intended to form a grand 
coalition. However, Claus called upon the SPD to hold talks 
with the PDS. It was the PDS' goal to prevent a CDU government, 
Claus said. 
  Alliance 90/Greens intend to support Hoeppner's candidacy. 
Heidrun Heidecke, the top candidate of the ecological party, 
said that with Hoeppner as minister-president, there were 
several conceivable variants of forming a government.

<F P=106> [Article by Michael Backhaus and Konrad R. Mueller: </F>
"Sisyphus Wants To Become Chancellor"] 
  [Text] He incessantly rolls uphill the stone of daily 
government business in Bonn. But in contrast to the futile 
drudgery in Greek mythology, the toiling by the chief of the 
Union caucus in the Bundestag is to be rewarded--with succession 
to Helmut Kohl. 
<H5>  "To Start Everyday Anew, Even If One Never Reaches a Final </H5>
Goal" 
  Wolfgang Schaeuble is quite aware that he does not lead a 
bourgeois life. That struck him once again, especially on 
Pentecost Monday. According to bourgeois standards, he should 
have spent the day with his wife and family in the esteemed 
"Adler" in the Glottertal to celebrate his silver wedding 
anniversary. Instead, he was busy in the Reichstag in Berlin to 
ensure that Roman Herzog becomes federal president. 
  Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the chairman of the 
Union caucus in the Bundestag sometimes pursues the question of 
how, and to what, compare the activity of a politician, and thus 
explain it better. The answer is surprising: For him, Sisyphus 
is the model, the Greek mythological figure condemned by the 
gods to incessantly roll a heavy stone up a mountain; but the 
stone again rolls down from the top immediately, so that there 
is no end to the toil. 
  However, it is not easy to imagine the success-oriented 
political manager as the "hero of the Absurd" and as "eternal 
rebel," as philosopher Albert Camus describes the unfortunate 
Sisyphus in his famous essay, "The Mythos of Sisyphus." Perhaps 
the French thinker's insight appeals more to Schaeuble: "There 
is no fate that cannot be overcome by contempt." 
  But Wolfgang Schaeuble's everyday life in Bonn also recalls 
Sisyphus. Last Wednesday, for example, a stone rolled back onto 
his desk which he had pushed away only a few days earlier: the 
law on indemnification and compensation payment, which is to 
regulate the return of lands expropriated in the former GDR 
between 1945 and 1949. The project will probably end up in the 
mediation committee of Bundesrat and Bundestag. As a politician, 
sighs the head of the Union caucus, one has to "start every day 
anew on this earth, even if one never reaches a final goal." 
Nonetheless, one can be "satisfied and happy." If Schaeuble does 
not always look like that, it may be explained by another of 
Camus' insights: "A face that labors so close to the stone has 
itself turned to stone." 
  The 51-year-old lawyer has relieved the chancellor of the 
stone of daily government business for some time now. Be it 
elderly care insurance, the solidarity pact or the question 
whether German soldiers are to participate in monitoring the 
airspace over Bosnia--it always holds true what a CDU [Christian 
Democratic Union] minister said recently: "While Kohl assumes 
more and more a presiding role, Schaeuble does the work." The 
chief of government, normally forever suspicious of potential 
rivals, not only tolerates this development, he even promotes it. 
  Very soon, the chancellor wants to publicly drape the ermine 
cape around his crown prince's shoulders. On 20 June, he will 
personally present Schaeuble's new book, Und der Zukunft 
Zugewandt [Turn Toward the Future]. Kohl watchers cannot 
remember any time when the chief of government had ever before 
honored an author in such a way. But Schaeuble is for Kohl "the 
beloved son in whom he is well pleased." 
<H5>  From a Cool-Headed but Liberal Pragmatist to "Godfather of </H5>
the Right" 
  Who is this frail man with a will of iron, who seems 
unstoppable on the road to becoming number one in the CDU? The 
judgments on him show a remarkably broad range. 
  Until the end of the 1980's, Schaeuble's cool pragmatism in 
solving problems and creating political majorities was 
considered proof of a relatively liberal mentality. Today, 
Social Democrat Peter Glotz classifies him as an intellectual 
arsonist when he calls him the "Godfather of the Right," because 
of his talk about nation and "foreignization." In fact, in past 
years Schaeuble demonstrated great understanding for the fears 
of too many foreigners. Yet he ignores the fact that shelters of 
asylum-seekers are still burning in Germany, and that foreigners 
are hunted down on open streets in broad daylight. One could 
have wished for a clear word from him. 
  If one wants to classify Schaeuble, one must go to his 
roots: 
his parents' home in Hornberg on the Black Forest train line; 
high school in Hausach, 10 kilometers distant; and today his 
house in Gengenbach, another 30 km further away; the years of 
law studies in Freiburg, just 50 km from home. Such a person is 
not out to conquer the world from the very beginning; rather, he 
wants to become someone at home. 
<H5>  "Wash the Neck, Don't Forget the Ears, Attend Church </H5>
Service," the Obedient Son Promised His Mother 
  This was also the goal of the education given to young 
Wolfgang and his brothers, Frieder and Thomas: 
conservative-strict, but also loving. Karl Schaeuble, a clerical 
employee who managed to become an independent tax consultant, 
and his wife, Gertrud, taught their boys to respect order, 
discipline, a sense of decency, and fear of God. Only recently, 
his mother came across a slip of paper with good intentions for 
the new year, which Wolfgang had written down at age eight or 
nine: Among other things, it said to wash one's neck and not 
forget the ears before going to school, and to attend church 
service. When Schaeuble today feels that the Gutachtal, where 
Hornberg is situated, "is terribly narrow," he means primarily 
its geography. But it may also be responsible for some 
narrowness in his nature. 
  Even today, the Black Forest homeland is for him a place of 
rest and retreat, especially with his family living there. He 
calls his wife Ingeborg and his two brothers the most important 
confidants when it concerns personal matters. Together with his 
oldest daughter, Christine, who was with him when "this shit 
happened," as he calls the attempt on his life in Oppenau on 12 
October 1990, they were his mainstay in the ensuing difficult 
weeks. Schaeuble is in frequent telephone contact with his 
parents whom he calls "Mama" and "Papa" as in his childhood 
days. And the fact that the Schaeuble boys emulated their father 
in all important ways, at best tried to surpass him, also 
indicates that childhood and youth passed "free of conflicts" as 
Wolfgang Schaeuble remembers. Although bent on success at school 
and in sports, and growing up during the philistine 1950's, no 
potential built up that would have led to protest or rebellion. 
In 1965, when turmoil set in at the universities, Schaeuble 
joined the CDU, of which his father was already a member. "The 
spirit of the times never interested me," comments Schaeuble on 
his life. His basic attitudes are rooted in the childhood 
experiences of the safe world of the Black Forest. 
  Gerhard Heinzmann, who graduated from high school with 
Schaeuble and today works as a clergyman in the diaconry of 
Pforzheim,is convinced that "his ethics of responsibility was 
molded by his parents and the church." Torsten Wolfgramm, 
formerly Schaeuble's FDP [Free Democratic Party] partner as 
parliamentary manager, recognizes in him "Max Weber's protestant 
performance ethics in person." The virtues of asceticism and 
work for work's sake, pointed out by sociologist Weber, have 
much to do with Schaeuble's system of values. For him, also, 
wasting time is basically one of the gravest sins. 
  This ethos, absorbed with mother's milk, also immunized him 
against the unrest of the 68' movement. The results of the 
"cultural revolutionary upheavals of the 1960's," as Schaeuble 
sees the emancipation push after 1968, he calls "exaggerated 
individualism and hedonism." Schaeuble stresses in conversation 
that a 'comprehensive insurance mentality' of citizens 
undermines the necessary community spirit. His demand for 
greater love for one's country, which always sounded a little 
like "hurrah patriotism," he nowadays explains as the desire for 
more public spirit, charity, and service to the community. And 
he takes the anti-European sting out of his chatter about the 
nation as "a community of protection and destiny" by stating 
that the Western ties of the old Federal Republic are a part of 
the "raison d'etat of united Germany also." 
  Schaeuble not only banks on nation and patriotism because he 
is still of the generation "which put candles in the windows on 
17 June," as his schoolmate Heinzmann recalls. Kohl's chief 
tactician is also concerned with maintaining the Union's sole 
position as the party of unity, and strengthening the right 
fringe. 
  Schaeuble's rise to the first rank of politics was closely 
linked to the policy on Germany. As interior minister, he worked 
out the unification treaty of 31 August 1990 with then-GDR state 
secretary Guenther Krause. Then, on 3 October, came 
reunification toward which Schaeuble had worked "as if in a 
frenzy." But he had never lost sight of party interests. He 
urged all-German elections early on. At that time, Kohl wanted 
to make him his designated successor. But on 12 October, the 
bullets of a demented would-be assassin tore Schaeuble out of 
the political machinery running full speed ahead. For a moment, 
everything seemed to be over. German unity and personal fate 
were linked even more closely for Schaeuble than for Kohl. 
<H5>  "How Enormously Consoling When People Are Kind to One" </H5>
  In Bonn it is being asked to what extent the attempt on his 
life and its consequences have changed Schaeuble. It is said he 
has become hard and bitter, that he is quick to anger, and that 
he takes criticism worse than anyone else. Schaeuble himself 
claims that, if he has changed at all, he has become more 
serene. Everything else he considers projections by healthy 
people who blame their insecurity in dealing with the 
handicapped on the latter. He counts among the most positive 
experiences "how enormously consoling it is when people are nice 
to one." That would have been "worth two years in the 
wheelchair," if he had had a choice. The coming election 
campaign will again prove that his disability, and the iron will 
not to let it get him down, has provided him with additional 
favor and fascination. A politician with a destiny is more 
fascinating than one with a smooth career. 
  It sounds almost regretful when Schaeuble states that the 
old 
FRG had been spared "trials endangering its existence." In his 
view, such tests would have answered not only the question 
whether western Germany was more than a fair-weather democracy; 
they would also have offered a chance to correct undesirable 
developments. Schaeuble is all the more determined to make use 
of the upheaval phase of reunification and the elimination of 
the East-West conflict for this purpose. The attempt to use the 
Bundeswehr within Germany, which he will pursue until he 
prevails, is only a small sample. 
  With this Sisyphus as chancellor, for whom spiritual and 
moral leadership is not an empty word, things could become 
uncomfortable.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda/Italy: Berlusconi on </F>
Conditions for Involvement"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 23 -- Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi on Thursday [23 June] reiterated that Italy would 
join an international peace-keeping force in Rwanda "only on 
certain conditions," including United Nations involvement and an 
agreement between the warring sides. 
  "If these conditions do not exist," Berlusconi told 
reporters 
after a cabinet meeting, "Italy will intervene with humanitarian 
action outside Rwandan territory." 
  An Italian peace-keeping contingent in Rwanda would involve 
450 troops. 
  Defense Minister Cesare Previti said Italian collaboration 
with France, which plans to deploy an interposition force of 
2,000 troops, is possible only "within the limits of 
humanitarian and logistical contributions."

Ministry Joint Mission"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 25 -- Italy early next week will 
send a joint delegation, from its foreign affairs and defense 
ministries, on a fact-finding mission to ascertain whether 
Italian troops could contribute to humanitarian efforts Rome has 
already embarked on there, a statement from the Foreign Ministry 
said. 
  The Farnesina [Foreign Ministry] added how the decision was 
made this morning during a defense-foreign coordination session 
and fell within "the framework of initiative by the Italian 
Government in favor of the populations in Rwanda and following 
the recent proposal to initiate consultations on a WEU (Western 
European Union) level and followed up by contacts the premier 
and foreign minister had in Corfu." 
  The ministry went on to state how this morning's session 
considered actions of protection and support of health 
structures, escorting convoys of prime necessities and refugees, 
as well as offering air transport.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Summit: Berlusconi on </F>
Domestic Issues"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Corfu, June 25 -- Long-running rumours of 
government moves to help the Italian auto industry with sales 
incentives on the lines of those offered in France were quashed 
by Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi for budget reasons here 
today. 
  Although he said the government would study the French 
measures, he told reporters that one could not forget budget 
limitations, adding that many of the measures the government had 
imagined in support of industry had been shelved for budgetary 
reasons. 
  In particular, he said Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini and 
the Auditor-General's Office were particularly zealous in 
telling the government that certain things cannot be done for 
financial reasons. 
  Asked about how he plans to keep the government on course in 
sorting out the public debt crisis while maintaining electoral 
pledges not to increase taxation, he said he had no reply "apart 
from indicating the work that needs to be done." In particular, 
he suggested that the money he needs could come from 
re-organising major budget sectors such as health, education and 
defence and containing expenditure on them. He also claimed the 
restructurisation he has in mind would maintain jobs or find 
alternative jobs for those working in some sectors. 
  "In this way, as soon as possible, we'll also find a way of 
making different investments for the money that comes from all 
of us," he said. "It has to be done, even if it isn't easy and 
can't be put into effect at once." 
  The national health service seems to be one budget item in 
Berlusconi's sights. Pointing to what he said was the "low 
quality" of the services offered, he also noted the waste 
involved, quoting union figures indicating that as much as 40 
percent of health service expenditure can be considered as waste. 
  According to Berlusconi, whose electoral platform rested on 
pledges designed to place Italian economic management on new 
foundations within a year or so, seemed to indicate that the 
time-scale should now be lengthened since even health service 
reform could take years. 
  "It's a big job, and the government will do it," he 
promised. 
"It's a job that can only be done in the course of years. It's 
a hope and it's a commitment. But one can't imagine doing it in 
a short time or without sacrifices." 
  In other domestic points, he said he was unable to say 
whether Italy intends to move to obtain French radar traces 
recorded at the time of the Ustica tragedy in June 1980, when an 
Italian airliner crashed into the sea north of Sicily, killing 
the 81 passengers and crew on board. 
  The crash has been explained variously by structural 
failure, 
a bomb on board or a missile. The preponderant view is that a 
missile was responsible and may have been fired by French or 
American vessels believed to have been in the area at the time. 
  "I'm not omniscient," said Berlusconi of reports that Italy 
would be seeking more active cooperation from France on the 
affair. "I am unable to answer. These are things I know 
nothing about." 
  Berlusconi also said he was thinking of creating a 
complaints 
or suggestions office at Palazzo Chigi, the Prime Minister's 
official residence.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Elections: Nine Upsets in Second </F>
Round of Balloting"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 27 -- The second ballot (held 
Sunday [26 June]) of local elections overturned the results of 
the first ballot (on June 12) in nine out of twenty-seven 
occasions. 
  In the runoffs for mayor, in six cases the candidate who 
came 
in second in the first round of balloting was elected in the 
second. This was the case in Asti (where Bianchino won with 56.9 
percent after gleaning only 28.7 percent in the first ballot 
when Nosenzo took 34.4 percent); in Catanzaro (where Gualtieri 
won with 55.1 percent after receiving only 31.8 percent the 
first time around when Laquaniti took 40.9 percent); in Messina 
(where Providenti won with 60.1 percent; 26.9 in the first round 
when Carmona took 32.1); in Oristani (Scarpa 52.9 percent; 19.7 
percent in the first round when Martinez took 30.1); and in 
Siracusa (where Fatuzzo won with 54.1 pecent; 31.6 in the first 
ballot when D'Ali took 36.1 percent). 
  The same thing occurred to candidates for provincial 
president in three Sicilian cities: Agrigento (where Vivacqua 
won with 51.2 percent after capturing only 25.0 percent in the 
first ballot when Russello took 46.3 percent); in Enna (where 
Galvagno won with 54.7 percent; 22.1 in the first ballot when 
Villari took 26.3 percent) and in Trapani (where Spitaleri won 
with 56.7 percent; 30.0 percent in the first ballot when 
Mariscalco took 49.9 percent).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Government and Unions Meet"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 21 -- The government will set up 
special authorities to coordinate spending in the transport and 
health sectors, union chiefs said after a meeting with ministers 
here Tuesday morning [21 June]. 
  Present for this morning's talks with leaders of the big 
three unions CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor], CISL 
[Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] and UIL [Italian 
Federation of Trade Unions] were Cabinet Undersecretary Gianni 
Letta, and the industry, budget and labour ministers, Vito 
Gnutti, Giancarlo Pagliarini and Clemente Mastella. 
  The discussions, part of a series of follow-up talks to last 
July's [1993] cost of labour accord, focussed on public demand 
and industrial policy, and culminated with an agreement to set 
up the transport and health authorities. Another authority, 
which keeps a check on spending in the computer industry, will 
be beefed up. 
  "We stressed that by coordinating spending in two such 
important sectors as health and transport you add to industrial 
policy," said CISL Secretary General Sergio D'Antoni. 
  According to Sergio Cofferati of the CGIL, "the July accord 
contained no precise indications on industrial policy. There 
can be no doubt, however, that this is a decisive issue for 
dealing with the employment crisis." 
  Cofferati had words of praise for the new government in this 
first session of talks on the July accord, saying "we can only 
appreciate the government's willingness to delve deeper into all 
these issues." 
  The unionists will return to the premier's office at 1600 
(1400 GMT) this afternoon to discuss renewal of the public 
sector contract which expired three years ago and has not been 
renegotiated due to lack of funds. 
  The question of the poorer southern Mezzogiorno region will 
be studied at a special meeting to be held June 30. A 
suggestion yesterday from Industry Minister Gnutti that southern 
workers might be paid proportionally lower wages than their 
central and northern colleagues prompted criticism from unions 
and the opposition.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Inflation Drops Below 4 Percent"] </F>
  [Excerpts] (ANSA) Rome, June 21 -- Inflation rates in eight 
major cities fell in June to an average of 3.7-3.8 percent, 
according to provisional figures released Tuesday [21 June] by 
the statistics institute Istat [Central Statistics Institute]. 
  This is the first time in 25 years that the average rate has 
fallen below 4 percent. 
  Food prices bucked the trend, rising higher than the average 
in June while clothing prices remained stable and electricity 
and heating costs varied greatly, falling in Bologna, Milan, 
Florence and Trieste but rising in Venice, Genoa and Naples. 
[passage omitted] 
  Premier Silvio Berlusconi and Labour Minister Clemente 
Mastella were amongst those who welcomed the low inflation 
figures after they were announced on Tuesday. "I hope this news 
does the markets good," said Berlusconi, "but often money 
markets have a logic all of their own, which is frequently far 
from reality." 
  For Mastella, the inflation figures could have positive 
repercussions for the labour market: "I hope these figures help. 
Falling consumer prices make it possible to proceed rapidly in 
the contract negotiation field." 
  Unionists, who met with government ministers for cost of 
labour talks this morning, saw the latest provisional inflation 
figures as a sign that a mini-budget promised by Treasury 
Minister Lamberto Dini yesterday would not be necessary. 
  "The fall in inflation shows that no corrective measures are 
necessary," said Sergio Cofferati of the CGIL [Italian General 
Confederation of Labor] union. "These conditions are right for 
reducing interest rates and thus keep the borrowing requirement 
under control."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Vatican/Cuba: Pope Urges Aid </F>
Organization To Break Embargo"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Vatican City, June 25 -- Pope John Paul II 
today called on religious and international aid organisations to 
exercise their "inalienable right to assist" Cuba despite the 
23-year U.S. embargo against the island. 
  In a firmly worded appeal against the ban on all trade, 
diplomatic relations and other contacts, the pope said it hurt 
only the Cuban nation's poorest. 
  Receiving the Cuban bishops for their five-yearly ad limina 
visit to the Vatican, the pope also cited a document written by 
them in September urging a national dialogue with the Cuban 
Government to steer the country out of its present crisis. In 
their document, the prelates urged a liberalisation of Cuba's 
politics and economy and also demanded respect for religious and 
civil liberties. 
  The document was published after insistent rumours that the 
Cuban Government was seeking Vatican assistance to end the 
embargo, offering concessions to local Catholics or even 
permission for a papal visit in return. 
  In June, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina visited Rome 
for talks with his Vatican counterpart, Jean-Louis Tauran, but 
the Vatican later denied all speculation that he was pressing 
for Vatican aid in stopping the embargo in exchange for a visit 
that the Pope had said he was keen to make, but the Cuban 
Government had previously termed "premature." 
  The Pope also cited a document approved by the Second 
Vatican 
Council asserting the church's right to go about its work among 
the peoples and to pass moral judgement on political systems as 
part of its mission to save souls and defend fundamental human 
rights. 
  The Vatican never broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba 
despite difficulties with government policy. When the bishops' 
report was published last year, the Cuban Government accused the 
Vatican of "betrayal" and "counter-revolutionary action," later 
complaining that the church had ignored warnings against 
consequences should the report be made public. 
  Speaking to the bishops today, the pope reiterated his 
desire 
to visit Cuba and reported on the increasing strength of the 
church there without directly mentioning the political situation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Vatican/Iraq: 'Aziz Meets Sodano </F>
on UN Embargo"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Vatican City, June 27 -- The effects of the 
UN embargo imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 
were examined here today in talks between Cardinal Secretary of 
State Angelo Sodano and Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq 'Aziz. 
  Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro told reporters later that 
the Holy See is standing by its policy of urging a "periodic" 
examination of the effects of embargoes such as those against 
Iraq, Cuba and Serbia on the populations involved. 
  Only two days ago, Pope John Paul II urged religious and 
international aid organisations to exercise their "inalienable 
right to assist" Cuba despite the 23-year embargo against the 
island, saying that the almost total ban on relations was only 
hurting the poorest Cubans. 
  According to Navarro, 'Aziz, who met Cardinal Sodano at his 
own request, briefed the prelate on the difficulties that the UN 
embargo continues to create for his country, above all the 
poorest Iraqis. 
  The spokesman pointed out that, in his New Year's speech to 
the Vatican diplomatic corps, the pope voiced concern over the 
effects of the embargoes and urged that they should be reviewed 
periodically "to avoid deleterious collateral effects" on the 
population. 
  The Vatican's policy on international embargoes started 
taking shape at least as long ago as early last year. In 
February 1993, the Vatican's representative at the UN, Msgr. 
Renato Raffaele Martino, urged greater flexibility in the 
embargo against Iraq, mentioning a "moral duty" because of its 
aggravation of the country's "humanitarian" situation. 
  The following May, in a message to the Iraqis taken to 
Baghdad by Cardinal Achille Silvestrini, the Vatican's man 
responsible for Eastern Rite Catholic churches, the pope did not 
mention the UN embargo, but he voiced the hope that the Iraqis 
would soon be able to re-establish "mutual and fruitful" 
relations with the rest of the world. 
  In the message, which was handed to President Saddam Husayn, 
the pope added that Iraq's emergence from isolation should take 
place in a "spirit of reconciliation and peace, within a 
framework of international solidarity and respect for the common 
good." 
  The papal missive also said the entire Catholic Church was 
"near" the Iraqis in their suffering and stressed that the "weak 
and innocent" were being forced to pay for "responsibilities for 
which they are not responsible." 
  The pope also voiced concern over the exodus of Iraqi 
Catholics since the Gulf war, voicing the hope that improved 
living conditions would enable them to stay.

  [Text] Ankara (DPA) -- In connection with the large Kurdish 
demonstration in Frankfurt on 25 June, Turkey warned the German 
authorities against "watering down" the ban on the illegal 
separatist Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). 
  A spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in Ankara 
on 27 June that "Turkey is disappointed at the fact that the 
demonstration was changed into an action of a terrorist 
organization." Turkey did not understand that following the ban 
on the PKK in Germany, the flags of the PKK and photos of its 
leader, Abdullah Ocalan, could have been shown unhindered in a 
demonstration against Turkey, he said. 
  "We do not want a terrorist organization to be encouraged to 
carry out new acts of violence, because the ban imposed upon 
them has been watered down. That is why we will lodge 
complaints with German authorities in Ankara, Bonn, and 
Frankfurt in the next few days," the spokesman said. The PKK 
has for 10 years waged a guerrilla war against Turkey for an 
independent Kurdistan, which has claimed more than 12,000 lives. 
It is also held responsible for the increasing bomb terror in 
Turkish holiday resorts.

<F P=106> [Report signed GGD: "Russia Joins Partnership for Peace"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Brussels (NATO), 22 Jun (BELGA) -- After months 
of hesitation, Russia joined the Partnership for Peace on 
Wednesday [22 June], thus opening the way for closer cooperation 
with NATO and more frequent consultation between Moscow and the 
Atlantic Alliance. In addition, it did not rule out the 
possible enlargement of the organization to include new members 
from East Europe. [passage omitted] 
  "Fifty-three years ago (22 June 1941), Nazi Germany attacked 
the Soviet Union, and this war cost Russia and the other states 
a heavy toll in human lifes," said [Russian Foreign Minister] 
Kozyrev at a news conference. Maintaining good relations 
between Moscow and other countries "constitutes the best 
guarantee for us that such a thing will not happen again," he 
said. 
  He also said that he was "convinced" that, by opening this 
new chapter in their relations, the Russian Federation and NATO 
would contribute to the building of a "more stable and more 
secure Europe." 
  "We want to create a Europe that is not only free of war, 
but 
also free of fear. We must not repeat Europe's past mistakes. 
The security of some cannot be ensured thanks to the insecurity 
of others," stated Sergio Balanzino, NATO deputy secretary 
general. 
  "NATO's enlargement, when it happens, will not mean 
isolating 
Russia or establishing new divisions or borders, nor will it 
move us away from a united Europe. It must be viewed as a 
contribution to stability in the new European-Atlantic order," 
Mr. Balanzino added. 
  When asked by the press, on several occasions, about NATO's 
enlargement to include East European countries, Kozyrev evaded 
the question by saying that his country had excellent relations 
with Poland, which wants to become a full member of NATO. A 
short time later, during a joint news conference with his 
American counterpart, Warren Christopher, the Russian foreign 
minister did not rule out Russia or other countries one day 
becoming full members of NATO, although he did say that the 
matter should not be rushed. 
  So far Russia has opposed the admission of some of its 
former 
satellite countries into NATO, something which NATO approved in 
January.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Ambassador Renato Ruggiero, </F>
candidate to head World Trade Organization, by Marco Cecchini; 
place and date not given: "New Trading Rules"] 
  [Text] Milan -- Trade? "Today the problem is to manage the 
new rules of international competition, to ensure that everyone 
respects the trading rules set by the Uruguay Round (the round 
of negotiations for liberalizing trade concluded last April in 
Morocco -- CORRIERE DELLA SERA editor's note), while the 
question of tariffs is in a certain sense behind us." 
  Ambassador Renato Ruggiero is one of the "strong" candidates 
for heading the WTO [World Trade Organization], the body which 
will replace GATT on 1 January and will work alongside the 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank in managing the international 
economy. 
  An important job, and not just a post from which to observe 
worldwide economy, but a position from which "disputes" between 
countries in the most disparate industrial sectors will be 
settled. 
  A task for which Ruggiero has received the explicit support, 
not only of Italy, but of European Commission President Jacques 
Delors, and of other countries. The question of the WTO should 
also be under discussion right now at the European summit which 
is taking place on the island of Corfu. 
  [Cecchini] Ambassador, you are saying that the problem of 
tariffs has in part been overcome. Can you explain your reasons 
for this affirmation? 
  [Ruggiero] The Uruguay Round accord marked the end of a 
cycle. The level of tariff protection in the industrial world 
has fallen to 3.5 percent. If one considers among other things 
that almost half the products entering developed countries do so 
at a zero rate, one gains an idea of the globalization achieved 
by the economy. New players are emerging in the market. The 
Monetary Fund calculates that in the next millennium the economy 
of the three Chinas will be three times the size of Germany's, 
twice the size of Japan's, and slightly higher than that of 
America. Even the European single market is small compared with 
such an integrated world. The reduction of tariffs in order to 
promote trade will continue, but today the real problem lies 
elsewhere: It is a question of managing the rules of 
international competition. 
  [Cecchini] Will this be the task of the WTO? 
  [Ruggiero] Exactly. The new rules of the game will serve 
everyone's interests. Industrialized and nonindustrialized 
countries alike. 
  [Cecchini] What will the WTO's particular role be? 
  [Ruggiero] It will have to put into practice the 18 
agreements contained in the 26,000 pages which make up the 
Uruguay Round. For the first time 123 countries have signed 
these agreements, developing nations have been fully included in 
the multilateral trade system and have taken part in the 
discussions on tariffs; and trade in new sectors, such as 
textiles and services, will be progressively liberalized. This 
is a genuine and specific revolution which will inevitably call 
for a regulatory center. 
  [Cecchini] And disputes? 
  [Ruggiero] These are one of the most important chapters. The 
WTO will have to create a sort of international court for 
settling disputes, stemming regionalism, and giving itself the 
tools for punishing those who fail to abide by the rules of the 
game. The lives of thousands of companies will be radically 
influenced by all this. 
  [Cecchini] An opportunity to come out of recession? 
  [Ruggiero] In particular. It is enough to think that, with 
East Europe, the Far East, and part of Africa, a market of 
almost 3 billion consumers is developing. What does all this 
mean? Simply that, with a disciplined trade system, the 
opportunities for development are simply enormous.

<F P=106> [Speech by Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of </F>
Trade, before the annual congress of the International Union of 
Producers and Distributors of Electricity in Birmingham: 
"Liberalized Energy Market Vital for Europe"] 
  [Text] Speaking at the Annual Congress of the International 
Union of Producers and Distributors of Electricity (UNIPEDE) in 
Birmingham, Mr. Heseltine said: 
  ``Significant barriers to trade still remain. We in the UK 
have been active in our support for liberalization of the energy 
market in the European Union because we recognize that 
competitive forces are needed to reduce costs and improve the 
competitiveness of European industry. We have therefore been 
disappointed at the slow progress which has been made on the 
European Commission's efforts to establish an open internal 
market in energy. 
  ``The Commission's proposal under discussion at present 
represents the first step on the road to liberalization. I do 
not underestimate the magnitude of the change which moving to a 
competitive environment will mean for many countries. And it 
will take time to carry out the restructuring needed. It is 
therefore imperative that we make the start now and redouble our 
efforts to reach agreement. 
  ``Because we all have so much to gain from liberalization, I 
would like to take this opportunity to allay some of the fears 
which have been expressed about opening up energy markets to 
competition. I have heard it said that it will deter long-term, 
large-scale investment by increasing uncertainty and thereby 
risk. But our experience in the UK has proved quite the 
reverse. Since 1989 investment in generation has almost trebled 
in real terms. And investment in transmission is four times 
what it was before privatisation. 
  ``Some also claim that national electricity systems must be 
controlled and planned, otherwise they will become unstable with 
wild swings between over-supply and under-supply. Again quite 
the opposite has happened in the UK. The system is better 
balanced than it was before with a more diverse range of primary 
fuels being used in generation. The move towards gas fired 
generation, which is so often portrayed by critics as an 
unwelcome effect of privatisation has in fact played a major 
part in bringing about the present diversity of the system. 
  ``And with diversity comes increased security of supply. If 
European electricity networks were opened up and we had a true 
single energy market this security through diversity could be 
available to everyone. ``In the 40 years since this congress 
was last held in the UK, electricity supply in this country has 
been through a period of growth and more recently a period of 
major structural and management change. We are proud of what 
has been achieved here and are eager to share our experience. 
In a world of increasingly open markets, liberalization in the 
energy sector has much to offer.''

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The common search data system of 
the Schengen states will probably be ready to go into operation 
in October, Bernd Schmidbauer, state minister in the 
chancellor's office, said in Berlin on Monday [27 June] before a 
meeting of the Executive Committee of the Schengen states 
Germany, France, Benelux states, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and 
Greece. With the so-called Schengen Information System the 
search for criminals and rejected asylum-seekers be made easier. 
  As soon as the information system, which is currently being 
tested, is put into operation, the Schengen Accord will come 
into force. In it the Schengen states have committed themselves 
to the gradual reduction of identity checks at the inland 
borders with compensation measures for checks at the external 
borders. According to the Schengen agreement, control of the 
external borders will be harmonized, as will the regulations for 
the issuing of visas and the entry of foreigners from third 
states. 
  At first the data of about 1 million people will be stored 
in 
the search system. At the beginning of the next year, material 
data relating to the search for e.g. forged passports, weapons, 
and stolen cars is to be added. In Germany alone access to the 
system, whose headquarters is in Strasbourg, will be possible 
via about 8,000 terminals at border checkpoints, in police 
stations, and during mobile operations. About 20 million marks 
will be spent on computers for this purpose. For the time 
being, Germany, France, Benelux states, Spain, and Portugal will 
participate in this system.

<F P=106> [Interview with Piet Dankert, Netherlands state secretary </F>
for foreign affairs, by unidentified correspondent; place and 
date not given: "Flimsy Computer Excuse for French Political 
Obstinacy"] 
  [Text] Perhaps it is the fact that he is resigning that 
makes the state secretary so forthright, or maybe it is a runup 
to an extremely critical position as a member of the European 
Parliament. Whatever the case, when it comes to Schengen, Piet 
Dankert does not mince his words. "This is a tragedy," he said, 
"an ongoing tragedy." 
  [ELSEVIER] So is Schengen synonymous with the failures of 
European integration? 
  [Dankert] I feel it is a matter of official sabotage of a 
political decision. 
  [ELSEVIER] What do you mean? 
  [Dankert] I have the strong impression that the French 
Interior Ministry has done its utmost to hinder the treaty from 
being implemented, and so far, it must be said, with a 
reasonable degree of success. 
  [ELSEVIER] Do you have an example of this? 
  [Dankert] Take, for example, the central computer of the 
Schengen Information System, which is under French control. 
Irrespective of the fact that the thing is useless, it has been 
shut down for five weeks because of a wrong command. Imagine 
that, a computer out of action for five weeks because of a wrong 
command! Have you ever heard of anything like that in industry? 
  [ELSEVIER] So what is wrong with the computer? 
  [Dankert] The system's national computers work perfectly, 
both from and to the central computer in the heavily guarded 
building in Strasbourg. However, we were told that problems are 
created when data from one country have to be transmitted via 
the central computer. 
  As far back as the ministerial meeting in Rome two years 
ago, 
we already objected that the French-German lobby did not choose 
the number one tender for a central computer, but the number 
two. Number one was a reputable U.S. company, which, 
incidentally, was headquartered in France. However, the French 
wanted the software to be supplied by a French state-owned 
company. History has taught us that we were right to object. 
Even the French are now saying that the software is useless. 
  But there is more. We are dealing with a French state-owned 
company in which the French Government has a direct interest. 
The continued existence of this company is dependent on further 
government assignments. 
  [ELSEVIER] You are suggesting that the French Government is 
purposely letting things drag on. 
  [Danker] I can note that at official level there has never 
been a constructive spirit to let the Schengen Information 
System function. Nor has there been such a spirit at the level 
of the Interior Ministries, neither under the past government, 
nor under the current government. Indeed, it was up to the 
French Foreign Ministry. This is related to the creation of 
Schengen as part of the European process. However, the Interior 
Ministry had a great deal of trouble looking over the border. 
Interior Ministries generally have problems doing that, but the 
French department is a case apart. 
  [ELSEVIER] Do you mean that the French have ulterior motives 
for stopping Schengen? 
  [Dankert] In recent years, the French have set a number of 
conditions, but at the talks last June in Madrid most of them 
were met. Only checks at external borders and Netherlands drug 
policy remain. Following further agreements, the French said in 
December: Things are going well. That message came from my 
French colleague Lamassoure at the Foreign Ministry, and it 
concerned Schengen. However, later we started noticing that they 
are not all that pleased, especially about the sale of hashish 
to foreigners in coffee shops. 
  In addition, the French still view Germany's eastern border 
as a problem. There are too many migrants coming through it. 
The Germans have already set up an extra 3,000 policemen there, 
but you will never make it watertight. Otherwise you have to 
start shooting, but that must not be our aim. 
  [ELSEVIER] So it is not really about the computer? 
  [Dankert] Perhaps in part, but I think that the computer is 
mainly an excuse for political obstinacy. 
  [ELSEVIER] What is going to happen now in Berlin? Is it time 
to pound the fist on the table? 
  [Dankert] We will get some insight into whether or not the 
problem with the computer is really a technical problem, or just 
an example of official or political sabotage. A crisis team has 
now been set up, but we are helpless because that thing is under 
the control of the French Government. My hope lies with the 
Germans, who are also fed up with it. I expect that they have 
sufficient political authority to raise a fist to the French. 
And if it should turn out that something really is wrong with 
the computer, then in Berlin we have to take the plunge and 
simply decide to set up another one. It is a scandal that this 
has lasted so long. This undermines European integration.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Commission, No </F>
Replacement for Delors as Summit Ends"] 
  [Excerpts] (ANSA) Corfu, June 25 -- The European Summit 
concluded today without reaching agreement on a successor to 
European Commission president Jacques Delors, who leaves his 
post at the end of the year. [passage omitted] 
  In a comment earlier this morning, before meetings began on 
the second day of the summit, Italian Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi said that "if there is no agreement today on one of 
the present candidates, others must be sought." 
  During negotiations yesterday, Italy had been seen as the 
swing vote in an election that confronted "pro-Europe" forces 
(which the Belgian Dehaene would be expected to represent) and 
the so-called Euro-skeptics, led by the British. 
  Italy, Martino explained, had "placed no personal or 
ideological vetos, just a methodological one" he said, referring 
to earlier reluctance to approve Dehaene as the result of 
Italy's "perplexity" because "a Franco-German initiative had 
been set in motion without prior consultation." 
  The Italian Foreign Minister said that Britain's position 
was 
different, however. "The problem is a methodological one and 
Prime Minister Major says he's not ready to bargain on the 
issue." 
  The question had seemed near to resolution late last night 
and early this morning, with much attention focusing on how 
Italian opinion would swing. 
  The new government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 
which 
has presented itself as more "Euro-moderate" than previous 
administrations, was seen by some as forging a conservative, 
"Euro-skeptic" alliance with Britain. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Summit: Berlusconi Sees </F>
Fruitful Future"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Corfu, June 25 -- Italian Prime Minister 
Silvio Berlusconi said here today that, after his first taste of 
a European summit, he is now optimistic over the chances of his 
government's constructive and fruitful cooperation with the 
other eleven EU [European Union] capitals. 
  At a summit marked by the EU leaders' failure to find 
agreement on a successor to Commission President Jacques Delors, 
Berlusconi told reporters at a press conference afterwards that 
he had found himself "on the same wave length" as the other 
summiteers. 
  On the naming of a new head to the EU's executive, 
Berlusconi 
said the Italian position was that the choice would be "of a 
philosophy" as much as a person whence the counsel against haste. 
  According to the Italian premier, the philosophy involves 
leaving only joint defence and security to the EU level of 
Europe, ensuring that joint economic policies are applied with a 
minimum of regulation and also requiring continual application 
of the "principle of subsidiarity" whereby the EU should not do 
what can be done at a lower level. 
  The Italian candidate for the commission presidency was Ruud 
Lubbers, but there were no objections to the Franco-German 
suggestion of Belgian premier Jean Luc Dehaene. The British 
veto postponed any decision until mid-July. "The important 
thing is for each country to identify itself in the new 
president," said Berlusconi. "For this reason, too, we have to 
wait a bit." 
  According to Berlusconi, he voiced support for a further 
summit on this specific issue on July 15. He also described the 
signing of Norway, Austria, Finland and Sweden into the EU as 
projecting the future union towards Central and East Europe. 
  In other points, he said Italy's only claim in Slovenia was 
to the return of property confiscated from Italian nationals 
after the war and forecast that the EU would only be able to 
introduce a single currency after the year 2000.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Commission for </F>
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons To Convene in The Hague"] 
  [Text] The Preparatory Commission for the Organisation for 
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will hold its seventh 
plenary session from 27 June to 1 July in The Hague. It is 
expected to be attended by a majority of the representatives of 
the 157 states which have signed the Convention on Chemical 
Weapons. The session will be chaired by Ambassador Grigoriy 
Berdenikov of the Russian Federation. The Convention on 
Chemical Weapons, opened to signature on 13 January 1993 and 
signed by 157 states, will enter into force 180 days after the 
date of deposit of the 65th instrument of ratification, but in 
no case earlier than two years after its opening for signature. 
Eight countries have ratified the convention so far. As soon 
as it enters into force, the convention will be applied by the 
OPCW. All major decisions are taken in its plenary sessions, 
and work is prepared in the Preparatory Commission or working 
groups and expert groups. On 27 June, Mr Ian Kenyon, Executive 
Secretary of the Preparatory Commission, will present a report 
reviewing developments and issues since the sixth plenary 
session in mid-April. Questions to be examined include the 
organisations' budget and programme, training of inspectors, 
confidentiality policy, inspection procedures for chemical 
weapons facilities including equipment and sampling and so on. 
The new president for the period August 1994 to February 1995 
will be elected from one of the Latin American signatory states. 
The Convention on Chemical Weapons prohibits all development, 
production, acquisition, retention, stockpiling, transfer and 
use of chemical weapons. Signatory states are obliged to 
destroy their chemical weapons and chemical weapons production 
facilities as well as any chemical weapons they may have 
abandoned on another state's territory. Implementation of the 
convention will be verified through reporting requirements, 
on-site inspections and short-notice challenge inspections. The 
civilian chemical industry will also have to comply with 
obligations regarding the production, processing or consumption 
of chemicals that are considered relevant to the objectives of 
the convention.

Zaire Assures Brussels"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 27 Jun (BELGA) -- No Belgian military 
personnel will be sent to Zaire as part of the logistical aid 
which Belgium is prepared to give to France for its Operation 
Turquoise in Rwanda, said concordant government sources on 
Monday [27 June]. 
  On Monday afternoon, the defense minister did not rule out 
that "a few dozen men" who are part of a medical unit would be 
sent in a few days to western Rwanda. The minister had said in 
the morning that Paris had asked Belgium to give it logistical 
aid -- more specifically, a medical unit -- for its Operation 
Turquoise in Rwanda. 
  Another government source, however, indicated to BELGA that 
it was unlikely that a single Belgian soldier would be sent to 
Africa. In this case, Belgian aid will be limited to providing 
medical aid, but without any human presence whatsoever.

<F P=106> [Report by John Mullin: "Mayhew Seeks To Calm Power-Sharing </F>
Fears"] 
  [Text] Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, 
yesterday moved to allay Unionist fears over Ulster's future 
amid speculation the IRA was about to suspend its campaign of 
violence. 
  Unionists remained unconvinced, pointing to Sir Patrick's 
remarks that realism, rather than history, would shape attitudes 
in the North. 
  Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said last week 
that Dublin was seeking cross-border institutional links in 
return for dropping its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland. 
  Sir Patrick, writing in SUNDAY LIFE, based in Belfast, said 
there would be no joint authority over Northern Ireland without 
the consent of the Unionist community. "The British Government 
is not engaged in some kind of conspiracy with Dublin to 
introduce joint authority whether as a first step to a united 
Ireland or at all." 
  He recalled Mr Reynolds's comments in telling an Oxford 
Union 
audience last month that any settlement required the agreement 
of the Unionists. 
  Sir Patrick said: "That is not the talk of a government 
blind to the fears of the Unionist people who share this island 
with other Irish people. These are honest and realistic 
statements, which recognise that history has certainly shaped 
traditional attitudes, but that those of tomorrow and beyond 
must be dictated by realism. I firmly believe that a proper and 
lasting peace will come. Despite the darkness of recent weeks, 
I sense that the desire to see a permanent change for the better 
grows daily." 
  There were reports yesterday that Sir Patrick -- who also 
criticised terrorists on both sides -- may move on from Northern 
Ireland in the forthcoming cabinet reshuffle. 
  One name being touted as a replacement is Brian Mawhinney, 
the Health Minister, an Ulsterman who had already had a stint as 
a junior minister in Northern Ireland. 
  Sinn Fein officials were last night playing down reports 
that 
the IRA was poised to announce an end to violence. 
  They said a formal response to the Downing Street 
declaration 
was still a fortnight or so away. The indications are that the 
most it will offer is an initial three-month ceasefire. THE 
MAIL ON SUNDAY suggested Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, was 
seeking the agreement of all 200 hardcore IRA men before 
announcing acceptance of the declaration. 
  Republican attacks continued yesterday, although without 
injury. A mortar was fired at a Royal Ulster Constabulary 
station at Pomeroy, Co Tyrone, and a missile missed four army 
vehicles in west Belfast. 
  A soldier from the Royal Irish [RIR] Regiment was remanded 
in 
civilian custody on Saturday, charged with the murder three 
months ago of Francis Brown, aged 38, a Catholic father of four. 
  The Ulster Volunteer Force had claimed responsibility for 
the 
murder. 
  Mr Brown was killed when a booby-trapped breeze block next 
to 
his lorry exploded outside his home in Portadown, Co Armagh. 
  Neil Thomas Irwin, aged 24, a private based at Drumadd 
Barracks, Armagh City, was also accused of four attempted 
murders. 
  In one, a bomb was thrown through the window of the home of 
the mother of a former Sinn Fein councillor. 
  Private Irwin was further accused of possessing explosives, 
an improvised booby trap and an assault rifle, with intent to 
endanger life. 
  Staff Sergeant Maurice James Nicholl, aged 37, also from the 
RIR Drumadd Barracks, was charged with possessing an improvised 
booby trap and an assault rifle with intent to endanger life. 
Both denied the charges and were remanded in custody by Belfast 
magistrates until July 15.

  [Text] The British ambassador in Athens conveyed a verbal 
message to the Greek Government stressing that his country's 
refusal to accept Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's 
candidacy for the European Union [EU] Commission presidency is 
not in any way related to the Greek presidency. The British 
message further stressed that there will be no deviation from 
this position, even at the extraordinary EU summit that will be 
held on 15 July in Brussels. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos made a statement on 
the issue today and told correspondents that Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou will assess the prerequisites for our 
country's representation at the extraordinary EU summit. It is 
recalled that the prime minister said in Corfu that our country 
will be represented at that summit at a lower level. 
  At the same time, commenting on press reports that the 
British prime minister, speaking in the House of Commons, 
attributed responsibility for the failure to elect a EU 
Commission president to the Greek Presidency, Mr. Venizelos 
expressed his regret and said that if this stands it is an 
isolated remark that is at odds with the impression of all the 
other EU members.

<F P=106> [Interview with EU Commissioner Karel van Miert by Robert </F>
Hochner in Vienna on 27 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Hochner] What is behind the current controversy 
within the European Union [EU] over the successor to Commission 
President Jacques Delors? 
  [Van Miert] Behind this controversy over personalities there 
are also different concepts. The British are in favor of a -- 
how should I say -- very flexible Europe, a sort of free-trade 
area, and would prefer to do as little as possible as far as 
environmental or social issues are concerned. So their concept 
is completely different to that of Mr. Kohl or Mr. Mitterrand, 
for example. Behind this crisis over electing a new Commission 
president is actually also a more profound crisis. I think that 
this is why the coming years will be very difficult. 
  [Hochner] One sign of the crisis -- not of the EU but of the 
member countries -- is the horrendous unemployment figures: 
Official figures speak of 17 million, while some have said that 
the actual figure may be as high as 20 million. If it wants to 
be or to remain credible in the eyes of its citizens, does the 
EU not have to develop and implement adequate concepts quickly 
against unemployment? 
  [Van Miert] Of course, it has to. This is why the European 
Commission with the driving force of Jacques Delors presented 
this White Book, which actually creates the framework conditions 
for a common policy toward employment policy, stimulating the 
economy again, of course, also for environmental policy, and for 
better protection of the EU against third countries. 
Unfortunately, all this was not dealt with adequately in Corfu. 
Therefore, I am most disappointed that all that happened there 
was the dispute over who will succeed Delors. The great 
problems such as unemployment, the competitive strength of our 
economy, etc., were actually only dealt with marginally, which 
is a shame. 
  [Hochner] One of the problems of the future -- you have 
mentioned competition -- is to make competitive strength 
compatible with the protection of the environment. There are 
those who say that environmental protection kills jobs -- 
industry representatives often hold that view, whereas others 
say that environmental protection creates jobs. Is this linkage 
appropriate at all, or does one not have to say clearly that 
environmental protection is necessary to protect the 
environment, and jobs have to be created or saved because we 
need jobs. 
  [Van Miert] I think that a modern economy has to do both, 
which is why we need an overall strategy. There can be no doubt 
that we must try to achieve enough growth. Yet, this must not 
be done in the old way, for we need growth in quality. Of 
course, we have to do something to reduce the cost of labor; for 
example, if we introduce a new carbon dioxide tax, an energy 
tax, then we could use the money to reduce the social costs of 
work. So there is a lot to do and, as I said before, all 
relevant proposals are already included in the EU's white book. 
What we lack are the joint efforts by the member states to 
tackle this challenge. The real tragedy is that today we do not 
have too much of Europe but too little to tackle these great 
challenges in the sphere of growth -- growth in quality -- 
environmental policy, competitive strength, and employment 
policy; efforts are still too much based on national priorities 
and sometimes one member state even does something against other 
member states. My conclusion is clear, and it is something 
against the currently prevailing opinion in Europe: We will 
manage to overcome this great challenge only when we cooperate 
more and cooperate more efficiently than in the past. This 
means that we must also depart from the veto right, from the 
principle of unanimous decisions. If we fail to do that, things 
will never turn out as they should.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bernardo Valli: "The Italian Waltz"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi and Foreign Minister Antonio Martino were both making 
their debut on the Greek island [Corfu]. This was the first 
time that they took part in a meeting of heads of state and 
government, and it was only natural that they should elicit a 
certain amount of curiosity. Given that this was a European 
summit, observers -- and no doubt the main players themselves -- 
paid special attention to the statements and, even more so, the 
behavior of the representatives of the new government in Rome. 
It was important to know whether their entry on the European 
scene on a particularly significant occasion would change the 
balance of forces between free-traders and unionists -- in 
short, whether Italy was going to persevere in its Europeanist 
position or, on the contrary, align itself with the 
Euro-skeptics, as indeed certain clues suggested might happen. 
Over [European Commission President] Delors' successor, would 
Rome take sides with the Bonn-Paris axis or, alternatively, with 
London? 
  Right from the first day, on Friday 24 June, as the summit 
began, it became apparent that Rome was gravitating toward 
London. Observers -- whether British, French, or German -- noted 
this tendency without however expressing any surprise, since it 
confirmed the forecasts that had been made for some time. 
However, in the evening of that same day, Italy shifted its 
position by performing a magnificent pirouette. The prime 
minister could not resist the [German] chancellor's beckoning 
and, relinquishing his free-tradist position, came down with his 
vote on the unionists' side. 
  How can he be blamed for that sudden change, considering 
that 
in the second -- and final -- round, Belgium's Dehaene, whose 
candidacy was supported by Paris and Bonn, won 11 votes out of 
12, and was only flunked because of [British Prime Minister] 
John Major's veto? 
  The prime minister's common sense probably prevailed over 
the 
foreign minister's line. Forced to repress his Thatcherite 
feelings, Antonio Martino hastened to assuage the irritation 
understandably felt by the Britons, who had once again relied on 
Italy's support only to be let down as usual. (The turnabout 
must have reminded Foreign Office officials of many episodes at 
the time of De Michelis, Antonio Martino's predecessor under 
Craxi). 
  However, the Corfu summit has failed to clarify Italy's 
position in the European field. It is too early. At present, 
priorities lie elsewhere. Above all, the government in Rome now 
wants to be accepted by the international political community, 
particularly by the European one. After being treated rudely on 
so many occasions, Silvio Berlusconi finds comfort in smiles and 
handshakes. They are ointments on his open wounds. The German 
chancellor's cordiality (and perhaps the prospect of enabling 
Forza Italia's European deputies to join the Christian 
Democratic parliamentary group in Brussels, from which they have 
so far been excluded) weigh more than Foreign Minister Antonio 
Martino's Thatcherite leanings. 
  Smiles also carried much weight in Rome, at the time of 
Clinton's visit. The American President flatly turned down 
Italy's demand to become a permanent member of the Security 
Council, as well as the more legitimate demand to take part in 
the "contact group" for Bosnia -- more legitimate in that Italy 
is providing bases for the aircraft operating over former 
Yugoslavia, and should at least be among the countries involved 
in the various political initiatives. On that occasion, too, 
smiles counted more than facts. But we have not yet moved 
beyond smiles.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Larserik Haggman, editor in chief of Nordic </F>
Council magazine NORDISK KONTAKT: "The Nordic Region and the EU"] 
  [Text] Following the 1980's, in which there was a lack of 
intellectual interest in Nordic affairs and often justified 
criticism of official Nordic cooperation, the 1990's dawned, 
bringing with them a new attitude. 
  Researchers who had not managed to seriously devote 
themselves to the static Nordic Region discovered a new interest 
after the end of the Cold War and saw it as a duty to study the 
challenges facing the Nordic countries and the Nordic Region as 
a whole. 
  Denmark saw a chance to get the other Nordic countries into 
the European Union EU and went about it so zealously as to cause 
irritation on the part of its neighbors. 
  In Norway, the experience of 1972 awoke in many leading 
politicians a fear of losing Nordic cooperation as well if 
Sweden and Finland joined the EU. 
  When Sweden, with no advance warning, announced its 
intention 
to apply for membership, its action clearly upset the Finnish 
and Norwegian timetables, but it obviously also left the Finnish 
establishment with no choice. 
  Naturally, as far as Sweden was concerned, this was mainly a 
matter of trying to protect its own primarily economic but also 
political interests in the rolling integration process, but it 
is very likely that there was also some thought of the 
possibility of heading up a Nordic group in a larger context. 
  Finland was in more or less the same position as Norway 
(except for the petroleum). Psychologically, it seemed obviously 
impossible that the EU's border might run through the Aland Sea, 
especially since as far as Finland in general is concerned, the 
Nordic Region is almost synonymous with Sweden. 
  The Nordic argument in favor of EU membership went furthest 
in Norway, where it began to be said that the path to the Nordic 
Region led through Europe. But in Sweden and Finland as well, 
the nationally deep-rooted and innocently positive attitude 
toward the Nordic Region was assiduously taken up as an argument 
in favor of EU membership. 
  The new prime ministers, Carl Bildt and Esko Aho--both 
Nordic 
supporters and former members of the Nordic Council--shared an 
obvious frustration, dating from the 1980's, with the 
ineffectiveness of Nordic cooperation. That feeling was 
expressed in many contexts, and it also colored the Nordic 
reform efforts undertaken by the two prime ministers along with 
their colleagues in Denmark, Iceland, and Norway. 
  At the same time, that same frustration and the picture of 
Nordic affairs that was being presented in the media undermined 
some of the credibility of the no side's arguments in favor of a 
Nordic Region as an alternative to the EU. 
  The common feature in work to reorganize the Nordic Council 
has been an effort to remove everything that will be handled by 
the EEA [European Economic Area]/EU, emphasize Nordic culture 
and identity, and, lastly, take the step from formal cooperation 
to informal consultation. 
  There is a lot that can be said about the probability of a 
common Nordic front in the EU, especially in light of the number 
of Nordic failures in "major" political areas, but the 
"official" viewpoint has come to be that the EU will benefit 
Nordic affairs and that Nordic cooperation can be successful 
only within the EU, provided that it takes the form of 
consultation. 
  But here we come up against a problem. So far, Nordic 
affairs 
have been a matter of interplay between popular opinion and 
direct, natural contact on the one hand and, on the other, 
permanent dialogue between members of parliament and governments. 
  But if the major (EU) issues are removed from cooperative 
dialogue and replaced by quick and frequent consultations, what 
will distinguish Nordic affairs from general international 
affairs? Is direct, practical, and somewhat elusive Nordic 
cooperation to be replaced by intrinsically and obviously 
intensive top-level contacts? And how will the link with popular 
organizations and civic organizations--or broader expressions of 
Nordic political opinion--be handled? 
  Regardless of which solutions the Nordic countries choose in 
this fall's referendums on the EU, there is reason to begin a 
debate, sometime before the overall picture emerges, regarding 
the entire many-faceted Nordic issue, high-level support for the 
policy, the channels of communications from the bottom up, and 
the various institutional alternatives that may exist. 
  The Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish EU negotiations gave no 
impression of any broader Nordic teamwork beyond consultation 
and the exchange of information. And the EU is skilled at 
playing one country off against another. This supports the 
opinion that Nordic affairs have had their day and that the 
issue now is Europe. But if that is so, there will have to be 
support for that decision--or else.

<F P=106> ["vwd/DPA"-attributed report: "Carl Bildt Speaks of </F>
European Inland Sea"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 27 June 1994 -- In Bonn on Monday [27 June], 
Sweden's Prime Minister Carl Bildt, Schleswig-Holstein Minister 
President Heide Simonis, and Mecklenburg Western Pomerania 
Minister President Berndt Seite predicted a great future for the 
Baltic Sea area as an economic region. Bild said that, within 
the next 10-15 years, the area would become one of the most 
important and dynamic regions in Europe. 
  In Bildt's view, it will now be important to develop the 
Baltic Sea into the "European Union's Inland Sea." In this 
connection he was also banking on the Federal Government and its 
upcoming EU presidency and the land governments of 
Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg Western Pomerania. 
  Seite and Simonis pointed out that the Baltic Sea area has 
been given a new perspective through the forthcoming EU 
accession of Sweden, Norway, and Finland, and the political 
changes and reforms in northeast and Central Europe. Seite: 
"The Baltic Sea has become a sea of opportunities." The 
countries on the shores of the Baltic Sea need future-oriented 
technologies. He, therefore, asked the Schleswig-Holstein 
minister president to participate in the Transrapid project. 
  Mrs. Simonis expects from the German EU presidency that the 
north would be integrated into the European Union more strongly, 
too, and that not "everything is pumped into the south of Europe 
-- the bacon belt," as has been the case so far. 
  The Swedish Government head also expressed his optimism in 
Bonn that his country's accession to the European Union would be 
supported in the upcoming referendum. With the exception of the 
former communists, all Swedish parties gave a clear signal to 
vote "yes." He was quite sure that the Swedes would vote in 
favor, Bildt said, adding that he also assumed that the 
referendums in Norway and Finland would yield a positive result, 
too. 
  For the prime minister, who signed the treaty with the 
European Union along with the government heads of the other 
Nordic EU candidates at the EU summit in Corfu, it is now of 
particular importance to initiate the process for Polish 
membership. "As far as this question is concerned, we are 
pinning high hopes on the German EU presidency, due to begin on 
1 July." The same applies to paving the way for Estonia, 
Latvia, and Lithuania for future EU membership. 
  He described the search for a new president of the EU 
Commission as the European Union's most important personnel 
decision for the next 10 years. "All three men that have been 
in the contest so far are very good candidates," he said. Bildt 
said he was having difficulties noticing differences on basic EU 
issues between them. 
  In a lecture he gave later in Bonn, Bildt, whose schedule 
also included a meeting with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 
pleaded for integrating Russia more closely into Baltic 
cooperation. World War II will really be over only when the 
last Russian Forces had withdrawn from the Baltic states. He 
welcomed the European Union's partnership agreement with Russia. 
He appealed to the Baltic countries to be generous toward their 
Russian inhabitants.

  [Text] Strasbourg, France June 28 (A.A.) -- Five members 
of the abolished Democracy Party (DEP) arrived here today to 
hold contacts at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
Europe. 
  The six deputies fled Turkey June 15, one day before the 
Constitutional Court banned the party on the grounds that it 
supposedly spread separatist propaganda and sided with the 
separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
organization. 
  Attending a pro-PKK rally in Frankfurt over the weekend, 
Zubeyir Aydar, one of the deputies, said about the recent PKK 
bombings in tourist places which wounded about 20 people and 
killed a British tourist that, "we regret the bombings but we 
(PKK supporters) had to do it." 
  The deputies will reportedly meet the leaders of commissions 
and political groups here and are trying to schedule a press 
conference at the Council of Europe on Wednesday [29 June].

<F P=106> [Article by Evita Neefs: "Increased Hope of Solution to </F>
Korean Crisis"] 
  [Text] There was great relief when U.S. President Bill 
Clinton announced a "very positive development" in the Korean 
conflict and the existence of "an opportunity to find a 
solution." Clinton was referring to Pyongyang's readiness to 
freeze its nuclear program, in exchange for which he has agreed 
to renewed negotiations. Tension on and around the peninsula 
has significantly decreased now that the United States has 
suspended its attempts to impose sanctions against North Korea. 
  At a hastily organized press conference Clinton declared 
that 
North Korea was complying with U.S. conditions for the 
resumption of high-level talks between the two countries. 
During the talks no spent nuclear fuel will be reprocessed for 
the manufacture of nuclear weapons, no new fuel rods will be 
loaded into the nuclear reactor, and international inspectors 
can continue with their work. North Korea has also undertaken in 
writing to respect all the stipulations laid down in the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  The United States agrees to begin talks from the beginning 
of 
July in Geneva on the nuclear issue, together with "all 
political, economic and security issues" of interest to the two 
countries. For the North Koreans this implies a promise that 
the Americans will not use an atomic weapon against them. They 
also want to discuss the replacement of their obsolete core 
reactors by light water reactors, the cost to be borne by the 
United States. 
  In China, Clinton's decision met with approval. Beijing sees 
it as confirmation of the course it adopted throughout the 
conflict: no sanctions, but diplomacy. 
  American reporters recently granted a rare visit to the 
Chinese-North Korean border have also been able to see how with 
such a porous border sanctions would not prove very effective in 
any event. In addition, the population of the Chinese border 
region is 40 percent ethnically Korean. It is uncertain where 
their loyalties would lie if a cordon was placed around North 
Korea. 
<H5>  Prosperity </H5>
  The relief was particularly great in South Korea. After more 
than fifty years of hardship the country is finally enjoying 
considerable prosperity and, more recently, democratic freedoms. 
All these achievements threatened to be reduced to nothing by 
U.S. saber-rattling, increasingly backed up by West Europe and 
Russia. In the name of the principle of nonproliferation. 
  Few people would deny that it is an important principle and 
one that is worth defending. In addition, North Korea may be 
seen as a test case for the treaty's renewal next year. 
  But those who have been stating over recent years that the 
issue, in North Korea's case, was not worth going to war, have 
some powerful arguments. The evidence against North Korea is 
inconclusive. The country's exact intentions are unclear. 
  The United States is also unable to present any global 
nuclear policy. Its position on countries such as Israel, 
South Africa, and Pakistan for example contrasts sharply with 
that taken on North Korea. And are countries such as India, 
that take offense at the difference between the recognized 
nuclear powers -- the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, 
France, China -- and other countries, altogether wrong? 
  Clinton, keen on a winner in the public opinion stakes after 
several humiliating defeats, also seemed all too ready to embark 
on confrontation. The visit by his predecessor Jimmy Carter to 
Pyongyang showed that the opportunities for diplomacy had not 
been exhausted. The conflict is not over and the President was 
right to point this out. But at least dialogue is being given a 
second chance. 
  Hopefully the meeting between Kim Yong-sam and Kim Il-song 
-- 
the two Korean presidents -- will take place. It could bring a 
breakthrough on a number of points, such as the reuniting of 
families, or human rights in the North, all of which were 
brushed aside as attention remained focused solely on the 
nuclear issue.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dirk Achten: "Not Just Wait"] </F>
  [Text] Jean-Luc Dehaene, a soccer fan and Belgian prime 
minister, will probably not become the president of the European 
Commission unless British Prime Minister John Major is ready to 
lose face in public, and it certainly would not be the first 
time. But even Dehaene's main sponsor, German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl, is inclined to put Dehaene on ice. It is called 
realpolitik. 
  In the United Kingdom, Major's opposition to the 11 other 
member states is being described by a considerable section of 
his party as proof of bravery in the face of a steamroller, 
steered by treacherous continental Europeans. The British prime 
minister was applauded in his parliament. 
  What does Major reproach Dehaene for, because after all he 
has to give some reason to justify his veto? That he is an 
enthusiastic state interventionist and moreover a convinced 
European federalist. Of course, in this country it does not have 
to be explained that Dehaene is not a fanatic neoliberal. But 
it is hard to imagine that his ideas are so far more to the left 
than those of the Socialist Jacques Delors. The point about 
being a European federalist is a very different story, because 
here it is about the British way of seeing Europe, or rather 
above all of not seeing it. 
  The United Kingdom, and certainly the present government 
there, want to limit Europe to being as big a free-trade zone as 
possible. Free trade, all the rest is superfluous or even highly 
undesirable in the eyes of these British. There should be no 
European works councils for large multinationals, preferably no 
monetary union and no social legislation. Sometimes it gives 
the impression that the British joined Europe to prevent a power 
bloc forming in continental Europe within which they would have 
no say or would only play second fiddle. 
  Therefore it is high time to give the United Kingdom what it 
is apparently asking for: A special status somewhere on the 
outside track, in such a way that the other countries, those 
which want to go further, do not suffer any nuisance from it. 
In fact it is already following this direction. The British 
veto against Dehaene makes it clear that it must quickly follow 
this path. It is a task for Belgian diplomacy among others. 
Because what happened in Corfu will not be forgotten lightly. 
  Dehaene can now concentrate a little more on the problems in 
his own country. Dehaene's prestige has increased. He has 
evolved from being an electoral risk factor to someone who can 
be put forward in elections by his party. In Europe, only the 
British do not want to know about him, but what credibility do 
the British still have in Europe? 
  Two major possibilities remain. Either Dehaene and the 
Christian People's Party decide that it would be better to 
immediately follow through on the impetus of the European 
elections and not give the Flemish Liberal Democrats any chance 
of recovery. That would mean early elections soon, but they are 
not immediately conceivable in the prime minister's present 
mood. Probably the choice will be for continuation, preferably 
to the end of 1995. 
  That presupposes a government which does more than just wait 
for its policies to bear fruit and then reap the harvest. 
Therefore it requires a very serious budget for 1995, not a 
paper operation which avoids the problems and reforms of the 
social security system to give it real chances of survival. 
Very quickly it should become clear if that is impossible, in 
which case it would be better to give up immediately.

<F P=106> [Article by Axel Buyse: "Operation Turquoise"] </F>
  [Text] Operation Turquoise, which the French are setting up 
for intervention in Rwanda, continues to raise questions. The 
Balladur government states that Paris is acting for purely 
humanitarian reasons. And that France has an obligation to 
intervene due to its traditional links with Africa, and because 
nobody else looks to do anything. 
  The latter argument cannot be easily brushed aside. What has 
happened in Rwanda over recent weeks is appalling. But no other 
country, no other body, seems prepared to become involved in 
this hornets' nest. Preparations to form a new force of blue 
helmets drag on. It is indeed the case that it is France or 
nobody at the present point in time. 
  But the doubt remains. A doubt which is broadly based on two 
kinds of consideration. The first is pragmatic. Do the risks 
Paris is taking weigh up against the possible benefits? The 
second is political. Nobody believes that France is going to 
Rwanda for purely humanitarian reasons. At another level, 
considerations of a totally different nature are also playing a 
role. 
  Quite unashamedly, France has long been pursuing power 
politics in Africa. It is above all on the basis of this clear 
presence in Africa that Paris is seeking to confirm its role as 
a "power." The operation in Rwanda is quite clearly also 
intended to defend and reinforce this role. The fact that 
Rwanda is a former Belgian and not a French colony is beside the 
point. Belgium set aside any colonial ambitions -- insofar as 
it ever had any -- at the time of the first colonial troubles in 
1960. 
  It is likely that France will take advantage of its 
temporarily increased military presence in the region to finish 
off a couple of odd jobs that it prefers not to see exposed to 
broad daylight. The claim that France, or at least French 
mercenaries, were involved in shooting down the plane carrying 
the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi remains unproven at 
present. But there are strong suspicions that the French still 
have men on the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] side of the front 
lines. 
  More important than any of this is the question as to 
whether 
the benefits of the French operation will outweigh the costs, 
and not only in terms of soldiers' lives. France readily uses 
its legendary Foreign Legion forces for operations of this kind, 
and the life of an anonymous "legionnaire" is less politically 
costly than that of a soldier in the regular forces. 
  One man who is certainly going to help spin the "turquoise" 
web is Mobutu Sese Seko. The French right has recently been 
buttering up the Zairian president. This has been made all the 
easier due to the poor performance of the opposition in 
Kinshasa. The fact that the French have to make use of their 
treaties with Zaire in order to implement their humanitarian 
operation can of course only further strengthen the president's 
diplomatic hand. 
  RPF spokesmen rightly point out the possible consequences of 
the French operation for stability in the [Zairian] Kivu 
province and in Burundi in particular. The operation could 
provoke both Hutu and Tutsi extremists in this neighboring 
country to insane actions. 
  At the same time, there is something squalid and perverse in 
the way the RPF is able to present itself as an African version 
of the Salvation Army. Many media people -- out of revulsion at 
the extent of the slaughter by Hutu extremists -- completely 
ignore the disastrous role the RPF played in upsetting the 
balance in Rwanda. In assessing the disaster that now afflicts 
Rwanda, there is an inclination to pass all too lightly over the 
fact that it was the RPF which, in October 1990, attacked a 
country where a tentative start to democratization was already 
under way. And that this aggression was only possible thanks to 
the full support of neighboring Uganda.

<F P=106> [Commentary signed GeWe: "A Question of Direction"] </F>
  [Text] In spite of a few milestones such as the signatures 
beneath the partnership agreement with Russia, and the accession 
treaties with Austria, Norway, Finland, and Sweden, there is a 
great shadow over the summit meeting in Corfu which was 
completed on Saturday [25 June]. The Twelve were unable to 
agree on a new president of the European Commission. Once 
again, it was the fault of John Major, for whom the 11:1 
grouping is becoming a habit, just as it was for his predecessor 
Margaret Thatcher. On the surface it is a poker game with 
people, but there is much more to it than that: It is a 
question of what kind of Europe is to come out of the Twelve, or 
the Sixteen. 
  John Major and his Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd twisted and 
turned like eels, first denouncing the disputed Franco-German 
approach for Dehaene's nomination, then criticizing his belated 
official candidature. They were unable to hide the fact that 
the real issue is something quite different: The development of 
the European Union into a federalist structure, which is what 
most of the member states want, or a Europe of nation states 
with all the risks and inadequacies that an excessively 
nationalistic orientation entail. 
  Many things become clear both from statements by Major 
himself and by the British delegation: "Dehaene -- an 
interventionist," "It's a matter of a particular conception of 
Europe," and from their behaviour. Initially, Major supported 
his fellow countryman Sir Leon Brittan. Although this was 
legitimate, it suggested that London hoped for a British Europe. 
When Brittan's candidature was not supported by any other 
member, the Prime Minister switched to Lubbers' side. After the 
"Atlanticists" from The Hague eventually threw in the towel, 
Major became stubborn and used his veto. Dehaene was not 
acceptable, and it was a matter of principle. In other words, 
London was afraid of excessive interference by Brussels in 
national affairs, a continuation of the Delors course and the 
creation of a Europe on Maastricht lines. 
  Maastricht Europe is not a negative concept. After all, it 
was drafted in 1991 under the Luxembourg presidency with 
constructive assistance mainly from the founding members of the 
EU. For the British, however, the term means the same as it 
does for the anti-Europeans here: Brussels centralism, 
federalism, industrial policy, in short, "socialism by the back 
door" which scares the British Tories stiff. 
  Obviously, the nomination of the president of the Commission 
is connected with a certain direction. For this reason, 
Mitterrand and Kohl, both convinced Europeans, committed 
themselves to their much-criticized initiative for Dehaene and 
not for Lubbers who, as Council President, had already made too 
many concessions to Major in Maastricht in their opinion. This 
legitimate game has now been thwarted. Ought the British to 
have joined the initiative earlier? No, because there is nothing 
to suggest that there would have been agreement on a compromise 
candidate prior to the summit. 
  Where do we go from here? The Twelve have an obligation to 
the citizens of Europe and their mouthpiece, the European 
Parliament. Any unfinished business will have to be completed on 
15 July. Countries such as Luxembourg are still sticking to 
Dehaene's nomination. Major, however, is once again so far off 
course that any backing down on his part would probably put him 
out of 10 Downing Street for good this time. He has said he 
will never ever change his mind. These are the words of someone 
whose political fate is at stake if he makes a U-turn. 
  As it is a matter of urgency that the European Parliament 
ratify the new Commission on time, the telephone lines between 
the capital cities will become hot in the next few days. There 
is probably little point if several candidates line up again at 
the special summit in Brussels, since Corfu has shown that even 
the very mother of parliaments can sweep away democratic 
conventions (respecting the principle of the majority) because 
its own requirements were not satisfied. 
  The Eleven have no reason to go too far to meet the wishes 
of 
the British. The crisis would be the lesser of two evils. 
Ultimately, it is actually a question of what direction the 
European Union will take to overcome the division of our 
continent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Van Mierlo Sticks to `Purple' After </F>
Failed Round of Talks"] 
  [Excerpt] D66 [Democrats 66] leader Van Mierlo still wants 
to form a "purple" coalition [comprising the PvdA (Labor Party), 
the VVD (People's Party for Freedom and Democracy), and D66]. 
He does not see any credible possibility of forming any other 
majority coalition. "I want to return to the `purple' option," 
Van Mierlo stated on Monday evening [27 June] after his news 
conference on the failure of the current round of talks to form 
a "purple" coalition. The D66 leader accepts that the position 
he has taken greatly increases the likelihood of a minority 
coalition. 
  Van Mierlo asserted that it was VVD leader Bolkestein who 
had 
rendered impossible the option of a center-right cabinet in 
which D66 would be willing to participate. Bolkestein is 
demanding more interference in the budget and social security 
than D66 and the PvdA are ready to accept. 
  According to Van Mierlo, the "purple" coalition-to-be had 
already come a long way. He believes that only a coalition with 
a new composition will be able to withstand the burden of 18 
billion guilders in spending cuts. "A center-right coalition is 
not in a position to produce such a package without causing a 
lot of damage." 
  In mid-May, Van Mierlo, who with his 24 seats is 
indispensable to a majority coalition, described a center-left 
coalition with the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] as "lacking 
credibility." Yesterday evening, he restated this view. "How 
could the CDA and the PvdA after some four years in government 
and a severe election defeat credibly claim that they are going 
to pursue a totally different policy? Can you ask parties to do 
that? I mean, you can always forgive, but that is no basis on 
which to form a government." 
  Van Mierlo says: "I still see the only way of arriving at a 
majority cabinet as being with a `purple' coalition." Van 
Mierlo admitted that putting together a coalition at this point 
in time would serve no purpose. VVD leader Bolkestein also 
rejected the idea of such an attempt. Van Mierlo now hopes that 
it will become clear in the course of the following weeks that a 
majority coalition between the PvdA, the VVD, and D66 is the 
only possibility. "But I recognize the danger that others will 
form a minority government in the meantime," the D66 leader 
stated. Today, the leaders of all parties must again consult 
the Queen. At the beginning of May, the PvdA had said that 
their second option after a "purple" coalition would be a 
center-left government, while the VVD opted for a center-right 
government. In recent weeks, Bolkestein has often repeated that 
he would prefer to join the opposition ranks if the new 
government was not committed to a firm policy. The CDA probably 
wants an "informer" [a politician appointed by the Crown to 
assess the feasibility of the various coalitions] to look at the 
possibility of a government comprising the CDA, the VVD, and D66. 
  With the exception of "informer" Van Ardenne (VVD), VVD 
leader Bolkestein yesterday drew the blame from all concerned 
for the present failure. Bolkestein: "That leaves me cold." 
He strongly denied that he had laid new proposals on the table. 
He said that earlier in the negotiations he had already 
described cutbacks on, among other things, defense and 
infrastructure, as unjustified and unacceptable. 
  The VVD leader was unwilling to accept a proposal by PvdA 
leader Kok to find a creative solution to these budget problems 
on a year-to-year basis. Kok: "A slight fall in the rate of 
the dollar would cause the same problems." Bolkestein: "It 
would have been a time bomb under the next government. I want 
nothing to do with it." 
  Rather than this, the VVD leader wanted increased 
intervention in welfare payments, which was not acceptable to 
the PvdA. Kok: "This was obviously necessary to relieve the 
state budget and people on welfare are always there to be 
penalized. Bolkestein should have known that with such a 
proposal for social policy he would be going beyond the limits 
of what is a fair balance." 
  Bolkestein: "What was laid on the table now was the core of 
a government agreement for a fourth Lubbers government without 
any substantial measures. I am not going to sign up to that." 
  Van Mierlo: "Even if this government is able to save 18 
billion guilders? I must say that it is not the point. The old 
cliches are back again." 
  Van Mierlo: "It is a great disappointment. Bolkestein 
wanted everything, and immediately. It is of course crazy not 
to bring any creativity to the process." 
  Yesterday afternoon, Crown "informers" De Vries (PvdA), Van 
Ardenne (VVD), and Vis (D66) relinquished their mandate after it 
became clear on Sunday afternoon [26 June] that negotiations for 
a "purple" coalition had come stuck on Bolkestein's objections 
to a provisional accord on the main lines of a social, economic, 
and financial policy. The effects of this accord had been 
calculated by the Central Plan Bureau (CPB). 
  The results were positively received by the PvdA and D66 
"informers." De Vries: "I thought on Saturday evening when the 
CPB figures arrived: That looks good." The growth in jobs 
would be as much as 117,000 or even 140,000 in a more optimistic 
version. Two-thirds of the job growth would be in the market 
sector. These results do not vary very much from the VVD 
election program. 
  The relationship between the employed and the unemployed 
would improve, from around 86 unemployed to less than 85 
unemployed for every 100 employed. The fall in purchase power, 
the sensitive point for the PvdA, would remain limited. Neither 
those on minimum or average wages, with the exception of civil 
servants, would have to contribute anything. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Michel Leclercq] </F>
  [Excerpt] Paris, June 28 (AFP) -- Senior officials from the 
European Union, Russia, the United States and the United Nations 
met here Tuesday [28 June] to finalise plans for the future 
borders within Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Details of the map drawn up by the "contact group" are to be 
submitted to Bosnia-Herzegovina's Croat-Moslem federation and 
separatist Serbs in the next few days. 
  The group will also provide for possible sanctions if 
parties 
to the two-year conflict fail to accept the carve-up which gives 
the Croat-Moslem federation 51 percent of the former Yugoslav 
republic's territory and the Bosnian Serbs 49 percent. 
  The Serbs currently control 70 percent. 
  At their last meeting in London on June 16 the senior 
officials had practically agreed on where to draw the borders 
between the warring parties, diplomats said. 
  The map will be detailed and not leave out any disputed 
areas. 
  But both Bosnian Serbs and Moslems have so far rejected the 
proposed carve-up, saying it favored their foes. 
  The mainly Moslem Bosnian government has called for 58 
percent of the territory to form the Croat-Moslem federation. 
  Agreements reached by the diplomats and experts from 
Britain, 
France and Germany (representing the European Union), Russia, 
the United Nations and the United States will be submitted to a 
ministerial meeting in Geneva early next month for approval. 
  A German proposal for the ministers to meet on July 5 has 
not 
been confirmed. 
  A G-7 summit of leading industrialized nations in Naples on 
July 8-10 will then appeal to the warring sides to accept the 
proposals, billed as the "last chance" for peace by Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin. 
  It is feared that a refusal would lead to a flare-up in the 
former Yugoslav republic where a shaky one-month truce ends on 
July 10. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vienna, June 29 (AFP) -- Ukraine has signed a draft 
agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to 
allow the UN atomic watchdog agency to inspect its nuclear 
installations, an IAEA statement said Wednesday [29 June]. 
  Under the preliminary accord, "Ukraine undertakes to use the 
nuclear material and facilties under its jurisdiction or control 
exclusively for peaceful purposes." 
  The draft safeguards agreement, as it is known, was reached 
in two days of talks with Kiev officials at IAEA headquarters 
here and must be approved by the agency's Board of Governors 
takes it up in September. 
  It also provides for "the application of safeguards by the 
IAEA to all nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities 
of Ukraine." 
  IAEA spokesman Hans Friedrich Meyer said the draft accord is 
a key first step towards Ukraine's joining the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty. 
  Ukraine is the site of the world's worst civilian nuclear 
disaster, caused by a meltdown in the number four reactor at its 
Chernobyl nuclear plant on April 26, 1986. 
  Western states have been applying pressure for the plant to 
be totally shut down but President Leonid Kravchuk has brushed 
the demands aside, saying his country needs to keep it going for 
at least several more years to cover Ukraine's energy shortage.

  [Text] Vienna, June 28 (AFP) -- Austria's vice-chancellor, 
Erhard Busek, will boycott a visit by Chinese Premier Li Peng 
which begins Wednesday [29 June] to contest China's position on 
human rights. 
  Busek said he "will not participate in any of the meetings 
scheduled during Li's visit," because of comments made by Li 
that the question of human rights in China was not the business 
of foreigners. 
  Busek, head of the ruling conservative party (OevP), said he 
"simply does not understand" Li's comments. "This attitude is 
purely and simply unexplainable even accounting for China's 
history," he was quoted by his press service as saying. "Human 
rights concern everybody," he added. 
  The OevP shares the coalition government with Chancellor 
Franz Vranitzky's Social-Democrat Party. 
  Li was scheduled to sign Vienna's Golden Book for visitors 
on 
Thursday but other OevP leaders said they too would boycott this 
ceremony, so the ceremony has been officially cancelled "because 
of scheduling problems." 
  Austria is the first leg of a European tour by Li which will 
take him to Germany and Romania.

  [Begin Vranitzky recording] I think there are only two

then you have to consider what you will achieve with these two 
options. I think that in spite of rejecting and condemning the 
human rights situation in China, we Austrians, and other 
Europeans as well, would not change the situation if we chose to 
isolate the country. It has become clear from several other 
cases where the human rights situation is also unsatisfactory 
that the willingness to meet, to cooperate, is the better 
possibility, the better solution than isolating the country 
concerned. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report signed "a.s.": "China's Premier Li Peng To Visit </F>
Vienna -- Protests, While Industry Is Hoping"] 
  [Excerpts] Vienna -- The visit by Chinese Premier Li Peng, 
starting on Wednesday [29 June], is meeting with increasing 
protests in Austria that seem to be having some effect: Li Peng 
has canceled a severely criticized visit to Vienna's town hall 
and the signing of the Golden Book owing to his "tight 
schedule." Greens Spokesman Peter Pilz, and also the Viennese 
organization of the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] headed by 
Bernhard Goerg, had protested the planned signing of the Golden 
Book, announcing that they would boycott this act. 
  The Liberal Forum considers contact necessary, but says that 
"especially polite gestures" are inappropriate for the one 
responsible for the massacre in Tiananmen Square. Pilz called 
the guest a "mass murderer of the worst kind." 
  Several human rights organizations have announced that they 
will hold vigils and demonstrations. A vigil in front of the 
Federal Chancellery has, however, been banned by the 
authorities. [passage omitted] 
  Austria's industry is confident that Li Peng's five-day 
visit 
will result in orders from China. Besides ministers and state 
secretaries, the 270-strong delegation accompanying Li Peng will 
include 150 businessmen. Prior to the visit, the Chinese said 
that there is great demand for hydraulic power (turbines) and an 
interest in steel and railroad systems. A railroad agreement is 
to be signed. In addition to Vienna, the Chinese delegation 
will visit Linz (the nationalized Voest Alpine works) and 
Salzburg. 
  According to the Chinese Embassy, trade with China increased 
from 1.5 billion schillings in 1980 to 11.5 billion last year 
(imports: 7.8 billion). 
  The return visit to Chancellor Vranitzky's trip to China is 
the first visit to Austria by a Chinese premier.

<F P=106> [Article by George Jones and Philip Johnston: "Portillo </F>
Puts on Pressure for Changes in Europe"] 
  [Text] Tory Right-wingers, led by Mr Michael Portillo, 
served notice last night that the decision to veto Mr Jean-Luc 
Dehaene as European Commission president should mark the start 
of a campaign to change the direction of the Community. 
  As Mr Major basked in the praise of Conservative MPs on his 
return from the Corfu summit, the party's Eurosceptic wing began 
to reassert its influence. 
  Mr Portillo, the Treasury Chief Secretary, used a speech in 
Barcelona to increase the pressure on Mr Major to adopt a robust 
stance in Europe in defence of free market policies and less 
state interference in economic and social issues. 
  He scorned suggestions that Britain's more sceptial approach 
meant that it would "miss the bus" in Europe. "This imagery can 
be misleading," he said. "It suggests that speed is more 
important than direction." 
  Mr Portillo's speech will increase concern among EC leaders 
that Mr Major is under growing domestic pressure to return to 
the more confrontational attitude towards Europe adopted by Lady 
Thatcher. 
  The Euro-sceptics kept a low profile during the European 
elections, but are now emboldened by indications of a shift of 
emphasis in the Government towards a more critical posture. 
  After successfully putting pressure on Mr Major to veto the 
appointment of Mr Dehaene, the Right is seeking to ensure that 
he will take further steps to halt the integration of Europe in 
the run-up to the next Maastricht-style conference in 1996. The 
Prime Minister won an enthusiastic welcome at Westminster from 
Tory Euro-sceptics for his decision to block Mr Dehaene, the 
Belgian prime minister and a federalist in the mould of M 
Jacques Delors, the outgoing president. 
  Although his action has plunged Europe into crisis, his 
backbenchers were delighted that a strong stand had been taken 
in defence of the country's interests. 
  They packed the Commons, waving order papers in a show of 
solidarity. The biggest cheer came when Mr Major said that 
"being a good European does not mean signing up to everything 
which our partners propose." 
  It was the most confident performance he has given since his 
leadership was questioned last autumn. 
  The one discordant note on the Tory side was sounded by Sir 
Edward Heath. He said that use of the veto was "a matter for 
regret, not for rejoicing." 
  Mr Kenneth Baker, the former party chairman, said that Mr 
Major had taken "a courageous and popular decision." 
  Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Labour leader, said Mr Major was 
the "prisoner of the Euro-sceptics." Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal 
Democrat leader, said he had attempted to "portray the Punch and 
Judy farce at Corfu as Henry V at Agincourt, with himself in the 
title role." 
  Mr Major emphasised that he was sticking to his guns. He 
said: "I believe that there are a number of well-qualified 
people who could take on this post on the basis of a genuinely 
common accord." 
  Downing Street reaffirmed later that Mr Major remained ready 
to use the veto again if need be. 
  Mr Dehaene hinted yesterday that he might pull out of the 
race while Germany, which assumes the rotating EC presidency on 
Friday [1 July], embarked on a search for a compromise candidate. 
  The acrimony surrounding the blackballing of Mr Dehaene was 
reinforced when Downing Street sought to blame the crisis on the 
way France and Germany had tried to push him forward without 
proper consultation. 
  Officials said that Chancellor Kohl had not told Mr Major 
that he backed Mr Dehaene when the two leaders met in London in 
April, and claimed that he had not made up his mind, although Mr 
Major disclosed then that Sir Leon Brittan was his choice. 
  German insistence that they did not have a candidate 
continued even after reports that Herr Kohl and President 
Mitterrand had struck a deal at a meeting in Mulhouse last month 
to support Mr Dehaene.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sir Teddy Taylor, British Conservative </F>
member of Parliament, by Marc Rozen in London; date not given: 
"On the British Veto Against Jean-Luc Dehaene"] 
  [Text] [Rozen] What is your reaction to John Major's veto? 
  [Taylor] John Major was right to oppose the offensive 
launched by Germany and France. Messrs Kohl and Mitterrand 
produced this candidate out of their hat at the last minute, a 
few days before the opening of the Corfu summit. They wanted to 
impose him on the other partners by presenting them with a fait 
accompli. 
  We are seeing a growth in Euroskepticism in Great Britain. 
The action of the European Union is being openly criticized, 
its failure to solve major problems is obvious for all to see, 
and its constant interference in the national life of my country 
is contemptuous. John Major considered, and rightly so, that he 
had to take a stand against such an imposition. He must again 
use his veto if we are presented with a candidate such as 
Dehaene, who is unacceptable. 
  [Rozen] Is not Great Britain totally isolated within the 
Twelve? 
  [Taylor] No. The Community must be a free association, not 
controlled by the center, and which encourages subsidiarity. If 
we had to be helped to leave the Union, I am sure many people 
would welcome this decision. The Community is a totally 
discredited organization, incapable of meeting the major 
challenges such as unemployment, encouraged by dangerous devices 
such as the European Monetary System, its expenditure is out of 
all control, its lifestyle extravagant, and its debt dramatic. 
  [Rozen] With his weak parliamentary majority, is not John 
Major your virtual prisoner? 
  [Taylor] Our small group of Euroskeptics is no longer the 
only one to be flying the anti-Maastricht flag. We represent a 
majority within the Conservative party. The Europhiles, who 
currently have fewer than 30 members in the Parliament, are in a 
minority. They are keeping quiet. They have said nothing about 
Mr. Major's veto. That is proof that our point of view has 
finally won the day. 
  [Rozen] Is not Mr. Dehaene an ideal scapegoat for an 
unpopular prime minister such as John Major? 
  [Taylor] At the Maastricht negotiations, the Belgians did 
everything they could to prevent us from obtaining the monetary 
and social opt-out clauses. They are unrepentant federalists 
who want everything to be controlled from Brussels by a 
nonelected Commission. We saw that under the Belgian presidency. 
  [Rozen] Who would fit the bill for the next Commission 
president? 
  [Taylor] An accountant or an international businessman who 
manages the extravagant expenditure of an organization which 
squanders the money of the British taxpayer. 
  [Rozen] Why does Great Britain behave as if it was the black 
sheep of the Twelve? 
  [Taylor] The latest European elections benefitted the 
anti-Maastricht protest candidates. A dismal campaign has 
produced resounding results, changing the landscape in the 
principal countries. This was a striking and welcome example of 
the crisis of a Europe which is reaping what it has sown.

  [Text] London, June 29, IRNA -- The British Government has 
denounced last week's terrorist bomb blast at the holy shrine of 
Imam Reza (as) in Mashhad and offered commiserations for the 
Iranian pilgrim victims. The denunciation was made by assistant 
under-secretary to the Foreign Office [FCO], Andrew Green, 
during a meeting Monday [27 June] with the Iranian charge 
d'affaires to London, Gholamreza Ansari. 
  In the meeting, the Iranian charge delivered a letter from 
Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, to his British 
counterpart, Douglas Hurd, in which he called upon the UK 
Government to terminate the activities of the Mojahedin Khalq 
(MKO) terrorist group following its bombing of the shrine. 
  A similar message is understood to have been relayed to 
other 
European governments, which allow the activities of the 
anti-Iran terrorist group to go on unhindered in their countries. 
  In response, Green said that the British policy was clear in 
taking all appropriate measures to combat terrorism in Britain. 
He said the UK Government "condemned the bomb explosion and its 
perpetrators" and conveyed its condolences to the Iranian 
people. He added that "Britain does not in any way support the 
MKO." 
  With regard to the anti-Iran terrorist group taking over 
Persian programs on London's Spectrum radio on the day of its 
bombing attack in Mashhad, the British official said radio 
stations in the UK were free to broadcast as long as it was 
within the law. Any breach of law would be a matter for the 
radio authority, who report to the Department of National 
Heritage under the terms of the 1991 Broadcasting Act and Green 
acknowledged that an official complaint was being investigated. 
  The complaint was understood to have been raised by the 
chairman of the Britain-Iran parliamentary group, Peter 
Temple-Morris, who told IRNA Tuesday that he was raising the 
matter with the British minister responsible for broadcasting. 
The terrorist exploits of the MKO are well documented and the 
Conservative MP called it a "very sad error" to allow the 
station, which is officially authorized, to be used for 
subversive purposes in broadcasting anti- Iran propaganda. He 
said the organization had the technique of coming through in 
various disguises and making themselves as very presentable and 
pleasant young men that very few people in the west actually 
realized their terrorist background. 
  When challenged about allowing the terrorist group to 
transmit its propaganda, managing director of Spectrum, Wolfgang 
Bucci, said that the MKO presented itself as an "intellectual 
refugee group" under the name of Iranzamin. He said that its 
first week of broadcasts had worried him and had been surprized 
to learn more about the group that commonly describes itself as 
the National Council of Resistance of Iran.

<F P=106> [Statement by Hans-Ulrich Klose, Social Democratic Party of </F>
Germany Bundestag group chairman, at the Bundestag session in 
Bonn -- live] 
  [Text] Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  NEUE ZUERCHER-ZEITUNG has called the list of tasks of the 
forthcoming German EU [European Union] Council presidency 
ambitious. However, at the same time, it reports that the 
German foreign minister has told the media, and I quote, that 
Germany is not claiming that all the items on the agenda will be 
dealt with, unquote. This, Ladies and Gentlemen, hits the point. 
  Grand announcements but, as usual, a loophole in case things 
develop differently. [applause, unintelligible interjections] 
  At the moment there are 18 million unemployed in the EU. 
However, in Corfu they did not talk about these people but only 
about one person, the future Commission president. This was the 
focus of the reports, as if this had been the most important 
decision to be made. [unintelligible interjections] 
  Mr. Foreign Minister, the EU is not in troubled waters just 
because of this question but because quite obviously it cannot 
think of anything to overcome mass unemployment. [applause] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, 18 million -- this is dynamite for the 
EU. I am not a prophet, but I dare make a prediction: If it is 
not possible to reduce this figure and to reduce unemployment, 
the competition for jobs, which can already be seen in the EU 
nowadays, will weaken the EU's cohesion and will lead to 
renationalization in West Europe. This is an alarming prospect. 
[applause] 
  Those responsible in Europe and, above all the Federal 
Government, must, therefore, primarily deal with this problem, 
with employment and growth. It is right that they have been 
talking about it for approximately a year now. There is no lack 
of words, but there is a lack of deeds. Let us take the Federal 
Government for instance. The Federal Government sees three 
terms as the focus of its employment strategy: deregulation, 
flexibilization, and cost reduction. [unintelligible 
interjections] 
  Quite apart from the lack of style in publicly claiming a 
lack of technical knowledge in this respect to the Commission in 
Brussels, it is suggested that these are the appropriate recipes 
to improve the competitiveness of German industry. What has the 
Federal Government done in detail so far? What has it done to 
improve basic and advanced training? What has it done to reduce 
ancillary wage costs? What has it done to reduce the often 
deplored tax burden on the companies? The answer is: nothing. 
  It is not the Federal Government that has acted, but the 
companies that have set out to increase their productivity, 
primarily at the cost of the working people and with the 
consequence of even higher unemployment. And quite in keeping 
with the demand for solidarity in the economy, the trade unions 
have been restrained about wage increases and have accepted net 
losses in income. It was the trade unions and not the Federal 
Government. The Federal Government only pretends [applause] to 
be doing something, but in reality it is not doing anything. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, does this also apply to Corfu: words 
and nothing more? 
  Let us take the trans-European networks. For weeks and 
months Brussels and industrialists have been complaining that 
the responsible German state secretaries obviously have only one 
goal, namely to prevent proposals for programs that have been 
presented. In Brussels the gentlemen made it quite clear that 
they think investment for the expansion of the trans-European 
networks is gross nonsense. Why am I sitting here? a German 
state secretary has been quoted as saying. Basically, I do not 
care whether or not he really did say this. However, I do care 
that, quite obviously, right up to the meeting of the European 
Council in Corfu, the Federal Government delayed the opportunity 
to provide stimuli for growth and modernization and deliberately 
impeded it. [applause, unintelligible interjections] 
  Now, finally, in Corfu the European heads of state and 
government agreed on a top priority list with a total of 11 
major traffic projects. Even though the agreement of the 
Federal Government comes late, we welcome it, because the 
trans-European networks will provide stimuli for growth, because 
-- hopefully --jobs will be created, and because Germany will be 
linked even more strongly to its neighbors. This is a gain for 
the people and also for the economy. 
  However, we emphatically call on the Federal Government to 
give up its current delaying tactics in implementing the 
decisions made in Corfu. 
  We still doubt that it would be prepared to do that -- and 
not only because of shortcomings in the past. First, the 
Federal Government did not consider it necessary to discuss the 
matter in the German Bundestag before applying for the priority 
traffic projects in Brussels. It did not want to do so because 
of the binding nature that this would have had. Second, it does 
not seem to be the German transport minister who decides 
important transport projects, but the finance minister, who has 
so far opposed solid financing. [Finance Minister Waigel 
interrupts: You are going to take that back immediately.] 
  I am not taking that back, even for you, Mr. Waigel. 
[applause] 
  And finally, the German share in investment in the networks 
is curiously modest, at about 18 percent. It is most concerning 
that the project for the Paris-Berlin high-speed link ends in 
Mannheim in its Saarbruecken version and the Strasbourg version 
ends in Karlsruhe. Where is the connection to Frankfurt? Where 
is the link to Berlin? [applause] We expect an improvement on 
this, with possibilities to extend the link beyond Berlin. 
Particularly from the German standpoint it is sensible and 
necessary to extend infrastructure networks in Central Europe 
with the help of the EU and to connect them to networks in West 
Europe. This is primarily for use in transportation and 
telecommunications, but also for energy, for supply and waste 
disposal. Since Germany is the best supplier of infrastructure 
systems, it is also in the German interest to support these 
systems. These are future investments in the true sense of the 
word. [applause] We hear that the federal chancellor agreed in 
Corfu, let me quote, to ensure that these priority projects will 
not meet with financial obstacles that endanger their 
implementation [unquote]. We would like to know, Mr. Chancellor, 
how you are going to do this, how this funding is ensured. Or 
is this the frequently quoted financial planning, of which we 
hear that it exists, but which is not put on the table because 
the financial part is missing? [applause] 
  I would also like to point to the undisputed fact that a 
change in the subsidy policy for the east German laender, which 
are to receive 26 billion marks from European funds over the 
next six years, had to be pushed through by the Commission 
against resistance from the German economics minister. In 
Brussels, the German subsidy policy has for some time been 
considered out of date. That is why not only infrastructure 
projects are to be promoted in the future, but also 
environmental, research and development projects, as well as 
projects for training and retraining. What, Ladies and 
Gentlemen, speaks against this? Nothing. Quite the contrary, 
anyone viewing the problems without prejudice, anyone wanting to 
change the situation, should be grateful for additional 
opportunities. The economics minister seems to hold a different 
view. He advocates a policy of inactivity and calls it the 
market. We call it the wrong policy. [applause] 
  We judge the achievements of the economics minister by his 
ability to reduce unemployment. In his years in office he has 
not achieved anything in that sense. Bad news for Germany, poor 
prospects for Europe. [applause] Ladies and Gentlemen, 
competition for jobs does not only weaken solidarity in the 
Union, it also reduces its chances of actively contributing 
towards stabilization in the East and the south. Europe 
continues to be divided into different zones of prosperity. In 
this divided Europe, Germany is a border country. As long as 
this imbalance continues, there will be no security in Europe. 
We have experienced just how rapidly economic and social 
problems can turn into open ethnic and religious conflicts, how 
fast they brutalize a society, how destructive they can become. 
But what does the Federal Government do to prevent such 
conflicts? Of course, Mr. Kinkel, it is right to open the 
European perspective to the countries in Central and East 
Europe. The perspect of membership for some, cooperation for 
others, you discussed this in a friendly way. Not to be 
unfriendly, but stating facts, I would like to add the following: 
  Our opportunities to fill associate membership and 
cooperation agreements with material contents must be viewed 
realistically. At the moment, these are extremely limited, as 
is the support for opening markets and cooperation on the part 
of the population when unemployment is and remains high, and 
when people have to fear a further loss in jobs through 
competition from low-wage competitors. We must take a realistic 
view of our limited possibilities for action, because illusions 
are highly dangerous. [applause] 
  This is one reason why I am against our foreign minister 
constantly traveling through Europe as an advocate for the East 
Europeans -- today he was even an advocate for all of Europe. 
We Germans do not have a special function, no bridging 
function, but should operate in the West European context. This 
is one thing. The other is that he who would like to give 
everything to everybody also has to say how he wants to pay for 
it. [applause] Even today, people from all the political camps 
say that Germany's contributions to Europe are too high. In his 
last declaration on Europe here in the Bundestag, the chancellor 
himself said that. So if we cannot and do not want to raise our 
contributions to Europe, then the necessary financing of the 
enlargement eastward can only be achieved by cutting funds for 
the south. My question is: Is this what we want? 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, I am sure that enlargement eastward 
will not be successful if it is achieved at the cost of southern 
Europeans. This is where the second crisis arc is developing, a 
potential of pressure and risk that nobody should underestimate. 
Let us look at purely demographic developments. While the 
native population in West Europe is decreasing, even in Catholic 
countries such as Italy and Spain, it is strongly increasing, 
for example, in the Maghreb. More than 55 percent of the people 
there are under 25. Within the next 30 years, the population of 
North Africa will more than double. Even today this region 
suffers from high unemployment, social conflicts, and ecological 
problems, most notably the shortage of water. The soil for 
political fundamentalism, religiously motivated and politically 
perverted, is dangerously fertile. Not to see this would be 
ignorant. 
  The fact that it is only, or primarily, the Bundeswehr 
inspector general who thinks or talks about this worries me 
greatly. Right now the problem is not yet a military, but a 
political one. Even if we find it hard, Europe needs 
institutionalized cooperation with the countries of the southern 
Mediterranean. Dialogue with these countries -- economically, 
ecologically, technologically, and culturally -- must be 
strengthened, and personal contacts enhanced and used to prevent 
further alienation. This dialogue is difficult enough, and has 
become even more difficult through Europe's failure in Bosnia. 
Nevertheless, we have to conduct this dialogue, and the EU must 
promote negotiations with the North African countries with 
determination, because otherwise -- I predict -- a new line of 
conflict will emerge, in which it will be military officers who 
will finally have to do the thinking. 
  Mr. Kinkel, in your declaration you did not mention the 
Mediterranean. Nevertheless, I assume that you are thinking 
about it. Still, I have to ask what the Federal Government is 
doing in concrete terms? Does it have among its ranks a single 
Hans-Juergen Wischnewski, who conducts dialogue with the Arab 
world on a permanent basis, with great expert knowledge and 
understanding? [applause] 
  Mr. Kinkel, what exactly are you planning to do to use 
Germany's presidency for more dialogue and cooperation in the 
Mediterranean? Will your policy ultimately be entirely reduced 
to insulating the EU against those countries? We agree with you 
when you emphasize the necessity for a European immigration and 
asylum policy. And we also agree that labor permits should be 
issued only restrictively now. However, this cannot be 
everything. Unless people's hopes for better lives in their own 
countries can be fulfilled, the pressure of immigration will 
increase on West Europe. Legal measures alone will be 
insufficient to withstand this pressure. So, please use the 
presidency to develop, in close cooperation with France, Spain, 
Italy, and Greece, a system of cooperation with the Arab world. 
Foreign minister, development cooperation means working for 
peace. [applause] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the opposition has usually supported 
the government on European issues. We will continue to do so as 
long as we are the opposition and you are the government. But 
as long as you are the government, we expect more of you than 
just nice words. [applause] 
  I do not want to speak of a crisis. Europe has every 
opportunity to be more than a rock in the surf. However, things 
will not work without prospects, without the will to shape the 
future, without optimism for action, and we miss precisely this: 
a realistic concept and purposeful action. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, European reality has changed. The 
Central and East Europeans have returned to Europe. Sometimes, 
however, I wonder: to which Europe? To the Europe of the 
beginning of the 21st century or to the Europe of the end of the 
19th century. In any case, many problems and conflicts have 
returned that we believed we had overcome once and for all: 
poverty, unemployment, nationalism, and war. We are in 
troubled waters -- you are quite right, Mr. Foreign Minister -- 
but not because at the top echelon, under the rather clumsy 
German leadership, there is a controversy about the new 
Commission president. [applause] 
  The point is the real problems, the people's specific 
concerns and fears. What must be done? Gro Harlem Brundtland 
explained it as follows: We want to struggle for politics to 
get a grip on reality. We need more cross-border political 
measures so that people can shape their futures for themselves. 
And: Let us show that Europe shares responsibility for global 
justice. Finally, some people bear more responsibility than 
others, and some have better opportunities than others to take 
the initiative and to achieve goals. 
  The Norwegian prime minister is right. We should listen to 
her, Mr. Kinkel -- and so should you. [applause]

<F P=106> [Statement by Finance Minister Theo Waigel to the Bundestag </F>
in Bonn -- live] 
  [Text] Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  Colleague Klose, you were right in pointing out the 
number-one issue, namely mass unemployment in Europe. It is not 
true if you imply that we are neglecting this issue. The 
opposite is true. There is no issue that has been more in the 
focus of all debates and initiatives, both at the summit in 
Brussels at the end of last year and at the G-7 employment 
summit in Detroit, where, above all, German initiatives for 
training, the dual system, advanced training, retraining, were 
virtually presented as exemplary, where for the first time a 
policy for medium-sized industries was supported and demanded, 
as we have demanded for years and decades and in connection with 
which we have always said that it cannot and will not be just 
the big ones but also the medium-sized and small units that are 
able to react quickly and flexibly to these big economic 
challenges. We have made this an issue. [applause] 
  We have adopted a memorandum on this issue. We have outlined 
the basic guidelines of economic policy, the growth initiative. 
And in particular regarding what colleague Rexrodt has 
suggested regarding deregulation -- an initiative, in which 
leading industrialists, trade unionists, and scientists are 
supposed to participate so as to reexamine secondary legislation 
in Europe, just as it is done here in our country, and to check 
it for impediments to growth -- I do not understand why you 
criticize this, which has met with very broad approval and a 
good reception in Europe and now also at the Commission. 
  I do not know what kind of strangely divided relationship 
you 
have with the economic development in Germany. We will achieve 
a growth of more than 1.5 percent. Even though just a few weeks 
ago the IMF, OECD, and others predicted a growth of 0.1, 0.9, 
and 1.2 percent for us, today it is certain that this growth 
will amount to between 1.5 and 2 percent -- according to some 
forecasts rather closer to 2 than to 1.5 percent. We should all 
be happy about this. Does this perhaps not fit your election 
campaign concept? [applause, unintelligible interjections] 
  If you -- I did not want to do that now, Mr. Klose -- attack 
us in this way and want to hold us responsible for mass 
unemployment, then I do not spare you the question about the 
biggest impediment to investments. This constellation of 
red-green, and red-green with a popular-front character, as you 
are aiming for now in Saxony-Anhalt, would mean a disastrous 
negative growth initiative. [applause, unintelligible 
interjections] 
  This, colleague Klose, would be a disaster not only for 
Saxony-Anhalt, it would be a disastrous sign to the world. And 
I can only call on you, as a responsible politician, to make 
sure in time in your party that this will not take place in 
Germany. It would be good for our election campaign but 
damaging to Germany, Ladies and Gentlemen. 
  [Unidentified Bundestag vice president] Mr. Minister, are 
you willing to answer a question from Deputy Weiss? 
  [Waigel] Yes. 
  [Weiss] Thank you very much. Mr. Minister, may I reassure 
you that the popular front, which you see in Saxony-Anhalt, will 
certainly not come about -- simply because the Alliance 
90/Greens in Saxony-Anhalt developed out of the resistance to 
the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] and has nothing to do 
with what the SED did. Together with the Social Democratic 
Party, we will pursue a policy for the citizens in Saxony-Anhalt. 
  [Bundestag vice president] Deputy Weiss, would you please 
formulate this as a question so that I do not have any problems 
up here. 
  [Weiss] I asked the finance minister whether I may reassure 
him and I would like to reassure him. Thank you. 
  [Waigel] Colleague Weiss, if Alliance 90 consisted only of 
such men and women as you, a different possibility for talks 
would exist. But you represent neither the Greens in this 
alliance nor did you say a word about the Party of Democratic 
Socialism [PDS]. If one depends on the votes of the PDS, this is 
a fateful development in Germany and not only in Saxony-Anhalt. 
Therefore, I am not reassured. [applause, unintelligible 
interjections] 
  In your speeches up to now, Ladies and Gentlemen of the 
opposition, you did not acknowledge the dimensions of Corfu. It 
is true that the dispute over persons unfortunately covered the 
prospects and dimensions that were created. When we hear 
Russian President Yeltsin speaking of a divided continent 
growing together again, we can feel a development that 50 years 
ago our parents, our older sisters and brothers could only dream 
about. And when, through the expansion of the European Union 
[EU] by the Scandinavian states there will for be the first time 
a joint border between the EU and Russia, and when these deeply 
European states such as Austria and the Scandinavian states 
fulfill their functions as a bridge and central countries this 
is a very important time for Europe, of which we all, and 
especially the Federal Government can be proud. [applause] 
  And if through our constant urging we have succeeded in 
making a common European initiative a common initiative of the 
G-7 in Naples, and if the whole world finally realizes that what 
is happening or could happen in Ukraine, this is part of a newly 
acquired international responsibility that extends into the 
future. And, Ladies and Gentlemen, in spite of our tight budget 
in Germany, if money is required for this, it must be included 
in the budget. We owe this to our citizens in Europe, in 
Germany, and in the whole world. That has absolute priority. 
[applause] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the German presidency will give us the 
opportunity, to achieve significant progress for Europe. And 
this will be done by stabilizing, dynamizing, and deregulating. 
Strict budgetary discipline, the modernization and expansion of 
the European traffic infrastructure are necessary to achieve 
this. That deficit financing, as was attempted under the 
concept of global control in the 1960's and 1970's, is no longer 
feasible must also be known in Europe. It would not make sense 
to reduce deficits in all member countries to achieve the 
Maastricht criteria and to conduct deficit financing in the EU 
Commission at the same time. There are various possibilities of 
making use of the capital market via the excellent European 
Investment Bank. And, dear colleague Klose, a short telephone 
call to your former colleague Roth will convince you that the 
European Investment Bank is in a position to find the funds for 
private financing. [unintelligible interjections] Roth is now 
in perfect order in terms of market economy. It has been a long 
way, from my having discussions with him on television when he 
was chairman of the Young Socialists, up to his becoming a 
defender of the market economy in the Social Democratic Party. 
No one will see you when you call him. He will be able to 
convince you that the funds are available. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, one thing must be clear: When we 
tackle the convergence process, when we state excessive budget 
deficits, as is necessary in preparing the second stage of 
Monetary Union, we will make sure that the criteria are observed 
strictly. And this must concern everyone, including us. A 
watering down will not take place, stability criteria have 
priority. [applause] Regarding expenditure programs, these 
will be available. And it cannot be true that all the programs 
that ever existed in the EU will be continued forever. We will 
have to examine these things, let some programs expire and 
restructure some. And if by restructuring we can make funds 
available for the big European traffic infrastructure program, 
this is a necessary starting point for growth and a better 
infrastructure in Europe. [applause] 
  And with great determination we will also support the 
sustained fight against fraud to the disadvantage of the common 
budget. This is necessary to win the people's acceptance of 
Europe. Of course, we will also deal with the issue of 
contribution payments. What has been settled in the medium-term 
plans up to 1999 will not be changed. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen; we have to consider very carefully 
whether we want more programs. After all, we will be providing 
30 percent of the funds for each program but can get back no 
more than 19 or 20 percent. Of course, we will have to make 
sure that more money flows back to Germany. We have to make 
sure that the most stringent criteria and economy will apply for 
spending as they do in Germany. Yet, the other European partners 
must also be able to rely on us, on what was agreed and will, of 
course, continue. Moreover, the advantage of Europe must not 
only be seen in connection with the position of being a net 
payer, but it also has to be seen in terms of the national 
economy. If every German accounts for $7,000 in exports, every 
American for $2,000, and every Japanese for $1,850, then 
everybody knows what open borders mean for us, and what it means 
for us to be able to export to other countries. [applause] 
  Mr. Klose, as far as the trans-European networks are 
concerned, this has been identified in a group of Commissioner 
Christopherson, which is where the responsible officials sit 
[unintelligible interjections] .... I beg your pardon, but 
this was State Secretary Haller, an excellent man...and, of 
course, all this will be done in agreement and coordination with 
the responsible ministry, which is obvious. We do have such 
coordination, which you will first have to introduce in your 
Bundestag group. 
  We will also deal with the following issues -- I just 
mention 
keywords: tax harmonization, a most important issue for Europe 
and beyond. The second issue is the principle of country of 
origin with regard to the value-added tax; and the energy tax 
was mentioned before by Mr. Haussmann and by the foreign 
minister. 
  We are on a good course as far as the economic situation is 
concerned. We have set the course for the political situation 
in Europe in an unprecedented way; all that is most closely 
linked with our contribution, with what Germany is doing in 
Europe without dominating, but in a great spirit of partnership. 
  In my capacity as finance minister, I also paid a visit to 
all our partners in the past few weeks and months; a few days 
ago I also spoke with all finance ministers of the new future 
members to make preparations for the next six months in a 
harmonious process of partnership and cooperation. With Germany 
for Europe -- this is the slogan of our presidency, for which we 
are well prepared. Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Article by "hjh": "The SPD Wants To Form a Red-Green </F>
Government in Magdeburg"] 
  [Text] Magdeburg -- The Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] in Saxony-Anhalt wants to begin talks with the Alliance 
90/Greens immediately to create preconditions for a government 
led by SPD leader Reinhard Hoeppner. A corresponding decision 
was unanimously adopted yesterday at a joint session of the 
party's executive committee and the landtag group. Since the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] categorically rejects a 
coalition under Hoeppner's leadership, the only solution is a 
coalition between the SPD and the Greens. After the session, 
Hoeppner stated that he will run for the minister-president's 
position in any case. The SPD politician announced that in the 
event of his election, he wants to form a "grand coalition 
focusing on factual issues." To achieve this, he is ready to 
discuss cooperation with the CDU. There will be no talks with 
the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. However, the successor 
party of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, which won almost 
20 percent of the vote in Saxony-Anhalt, will also play a role. 
A red-green minority government would have 41 of a total of 90 
seats in the provincial government. The CDU holds 37 seats. 
  It has become known from Hoeppner's circle that he wants to 
form a red-green minority government that would rely on 
"vagabonding majorities" of the PDS and the CDU. Yet some 
members of the executive committee and the landtag group who 
participated in the session expressed concern about this course. 
As early as in the runup to the meeting, Saxony-Anhalt's deputy 
SPD leader and member of the Bundestag, Uwe Kuester, warned his 
party against "misjudging the realities." He described the 
grand coalition as the only realistic possibility of forming a 
stable government in Saxony-Anhalt. At a closed session, the 
SPD wants to determine its further procedure and its course for 
coalition talks in the next three days. The model of a red-green 
coalition was strongly rejected by the CDU. Acting 
Minister-President Christoph Bergner announced that his party 
will not tolerate a minority government led by Hoeppner. Those 
who assume responsibility must bear it in all areas, Bergner 
stressed. He described the various toleration models that were 
mentioned as "absurd proposals." Bergner pointed out that he 
did not understand why the SPD rejected a grand coalition with 
the CDU categorically before starting official talks. The 
minister-president announced that he will present a proposal for 
talks to the Social Democrats before the end of this week. 
Saxony-Anhalt's CDU leader Karl-Heinz Daehre wants to do the 
same thing. During such exploratory talks, the balance of power 
in a possible grand coalition might also be discussed, Bergner 
suggested. However, he ruled out a renunciation of the CDU of 
the minister-president's position. The head of government 
expressed the concern that, in the runup to the Bundestag 
elections, the SPD is no longer willing to hold serious talks, 
as a result of which Saxony-Anhalt might drift into a 
"decisionless phase." Thus, Bergner appealed to the SPD not to 
form a minority government without any real need. The CDU 
landtag group nominated Bergner, CDU Chairman Daehre, the 
reelected landtag group Chairman Juergen Scharf, and the cabinet 
members Walter Remmers and Wolfgang Boehmer as members of the 
negotiating team. It was also decided that the PDS is to 
receive the position of a vice president in the landtag. 
  Alliance 90/Greens confirmed their readiness for a coalition 
with the SPD. Exploratory talks are to start at the beginning 
of this week, Heidrun Heidecke announced. She stated that a 
Red-Green government might be tolerated both by the PDS and the 
CDU. Asked about the strict rejection of such a model by the 
CDU, Heidecke stated: "Even the CDU will stop sulking one day."

<F P=106> [Interview with President Richard von Weizsaecker by Gerhard </F>
Spoerl and Dirk Koch in Berlin; date not given: "Often We Were 
Not Ready To Risk Anything"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, are you an unorthodox 
thinker? 
  [Weizsaecker] I do not know what an unorthodox thinker is. 
The term is used in such a way that one could only choose 
between thinking and obeying. I do not consider this contrast 
very useful. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] According to Chancellor Kohl, an unorthodox 
thinker is a "very well disguised conformist." 
  [Weizsaecker] In that case, an unorthodox thinker would not 
be a thinker at all. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does this mean that you did not assume that 
the chancellor's statement was addressed to you? 
  [Weizsaecker] Why should I? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Because it might have been addressed to you. 
  [Weizsaecker] There is no reason for that. We are not 
fixated on each other. We assume our joint responsibility in 
different roles, as is our duty. 
  [Weizsaecker] You have often expressed controversial views 
in your statements and speeches during your term of office. 
  [Weizsaecker] Thinking and adaptation do not belong 
together. Someone can adapt himself or contradict constantly 
without having any ideas of his own. Thinking is linked with 
the task of being and remaining independent. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Federal presidents mainly deliver speeches. 
Should they be given more power in the future? 
  [Weizsaecker] I do not consider this a major issue. We are 
living in a period of change after the end of the Cold War -- 
not only in Germany but in the whole world. The former rigid 
fronts that determined our thinking and actions no longer exist. 
We need a new orientation. Whoever can should contribute to 
this. It will have an impact, no matter what constitutional 
power he holds. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you advocate upgrading the president's 
office? 
  [Weizsaecker] It would not be a bad idea to strengthen 
suprapartisan elements in our constitution. The president's 
office might be enabled to submit proposals for nominations of 
judges of the Supreme Court, for example. It would be useful to 
provide the president with instruments that make it possible for 
him to discuss issues concerning the orientation of the liberal 
democracy with independent public figures and to submit 
proposals -- naturally without infringing the responsibility and 
the competence of the other constitutional bodies. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Despite the melancholy of the farewell, do you 
get an uneasy feeling when you look at the country's situation? 
  [Weizsaecker] Generally, we are going through a period of 
change -- in both parts of Germany, in united Germany, in 
Europe, and in other parts of the world. We are facing new 
opportunities, but it is also more difficult to find a path. 
This is a big challenge. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Complaints about too much narrow-mindedness 
and reluctance to carry out reforms are widespread. For 
instance, this applies to the relationship between the Germans 
and the foreigners living here whose naturalization is difficult 
and who are deprived of the right to vote. 
  [Weizsaecker] In this respect, too, we are living in a 
transition period. During the Cold War, the borders were 
largely closed for immigrants. Only citizens from the European 
Community were exempted. This has changed completely. Habits 
change in our country. This process cannot take place 
overnight, but progress is noticeable. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does the required progress include the right 
of foreigners to dual citizenship? 
  [Weizsaecker] I remember an exemplary case from my term of 
office as Berlin mayor, which shows the importance of this 
problem. If young Turkish girls are born in Berlin who undergo 
vocational training and who prepare themselves for a life here 
and who have neither the intention nor the practical opportunity 
of returning to Anatolia, they will sooner or later have the 
desire to participate not only in the obligations but also in 
the rights of the citizens living here. At the same time, they 
live with their parents or grandparents who still know their 
home country and long to see it again, and who are often worried 
about he future of their daughters. It would be painful for 
them if their daughters would simply give up the citizenship of 
their ancestors. This should be prevented. 
  Is this understandable from a human viewpoint? Does it do us 
any harm if young Turkish girls hold both citizenships? I do 
not claim that one can generalize here. However, against the 
backdrop of a generalizing, rigid, and administrative tradition, 
we should also see specific human fates and adapt our rules in a 
more efficient manner to them than in the past. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you satisfied with the implementation of 
the asylum law? 
  [Weizsaecker] What was particularly important was not to 
reduce and limit the immigration issue to the asylum issue, as 
we have done for a long time. Immigrants may include 
asylum-seekers, civil war refugees, resettlers from the former 
Soviet Union, or people who have other motives. Thus, not all 
possible immigrants are asylum-seekers. A discussion on this 
topic has been initiated. We will adopt rules that serve the 
goal of regulating immigration in accordance with our interests 
and obligations. This is what other countries with whom we have 
very close relations have been doing for a long time on the 
basis of their experiences. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You were opposed to amendments to the asylum 
law. Now you have had to sign an asylum law that practically 
abolishes the basic right to asylum. Does this tarnish your 
term of office? 
  [Weizsaecker] The constitutional idea embodied in the asylum 
law will be implemented more effectively once it is part of an 
overall immigration law. It is being drafted but has not yet 
been completed. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why not? 
  [Weizsaecker] In no country in the world has the 
relationship between emigration and immigration changed so 
quickly within such a short period. We have accepted more 
people than any other country. Thus, we are in the middle of a 
longer public discussion to which I am also contributing. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are the Germans also learning from their 
neighbors how a relaxed nation should behave, as your successor 
Roman Herzog has suggested? 
  [Weizsaecker] In my view, this topic is not as serious as it 
sometimes seems in discussions. Every nation has its 
peculiarities. One of our special features is that, situated in 
the middle of the continent, we are surrounded by more neighbors 
than all other European nations. On the other hand, Germany has 
more inhabitants than any of our neighboring countries. 
However, we are not different from the people of other nations. 
  The nations will continue to exist and be needed in the 
foreseeable future --for the democratic control of the path 
toward Europe on which we have embarked, for example. This path 
leads us to joint institutions of European cooperation that are 
based on a secure legal foundation. 
  This is not in contradiction with the concerns of our 
nation. 
Quite the contrary: It is in our national interest for this 
process to continue. Particularly because we are situated in 
the middle of the continent, it is more logical and easy for us 
Germans to link the well-being of our country with the progress 
of European unification. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is the strong emphasis on the national element 
intended as a cohesive factor, as suggested by some parties? Is 
it possible to hold the diverging society together? 
  [Weizsaecker] There are different aspects. First: There is 
no doubt that the distance between the state and the citizens 
has increased, that a process of privatization is under way. 
Second: As far as the rights of the laender vis-a-vis the 
government are concerned, federalism is a completely undisputed 
and healthy element of our state structure. Third: Only 
appealing to national feelings with the aim of shutting 
ourselves off from the outside and of developing a special 
political role of national isolation because of our central 
geographical position would be dangerous. However, such ideas 
fortunately do not stand a chance of being realized. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How would you define the term nation? 
  [Weizsaecker] It is the joint responsibility for the past 
and the joint will to live, and the will to tackle the problems 
of the present and the future. Spiritual elements form the 
basis of a nation, not skin color or even the language. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, views on the joint basis in 
united Germany differ greatly. There was a vehement controversy 
at the Bundestag recently when the commission of inquiry 
presented its report on the dictatorship of the Socialist Unity 
Party of Germany. It was sparked off by a member of the Party 
of Democratic Socialism who reported about the antifascism at 
the beginning of the German Democratic Republic that inspired 
the resistance fighters and emigrants. Was he not right? 
  [Weizsaecker] In any event, such debates are urgently needed 
and very useful. Everyone should tell his biography. Then we 
will learn how to make the necessary differentiations. There 
were certainly die-hard Stalinists whose antifascism must not be 
seen as an excuse for the prolonged suppression of freedom with 
other instruments. On the other hand, there were emigrants who 
returned to divided Germany and made a new beginning with 
sincere convictions on the soil of the old GDR. Just think of 
Hans Mayer or Stefan Heym. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you believe that the demonization of the 
GDR leads to a nostalgia for the former east German state, as 
Pastor Friedrich Schorlemmer stated? 
  [Weizsaecker] Those who have lived all their lives in the 
West are well advised to listen to Friedrich Schorlemmer. They 
can learn a great deal. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The central topic during your 10 years of 
office was the German past. Your views focused on guilt, shame, 
and responsibility. One always noticed your personal 
commitment, which may have been the reason for the positive 
response. You, born in 1920, were a soldier after 1938. You 
knew some of the men who attacked Hitler on 20 July 1944. In 
retrospect, do you wish you had been more courageous? 
  [Weizsaecker] We did not hold very important positions. We 
were constantly exposed to one-sided propaganda. However, often 
we were not ready to risk anything and not courageous enough to 
really open our eyes and follow the signs of injustice. I was 
most impressed by the students of the White Rose in Munich or 
the Quangel workers in Berlin-Wedding who did nothing but name 
the traces of Nazi crimes and give evidence for the truth while 
risking their lives. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Did you feel guilty because you survived? 
  [Weizsaecker] There were such moments. But then one wants 
to continue to live as decently as possible. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, at the end of their terms of 
office, politicians usually think about what will be written 
about them in the history books. Willy Brandt used to say: "I 
tried hard." Helmut Schmidt said in an equally dry manner that 
he would like to read the following about himself: "He carried 
out his task in a decent manner." What do you want the 
historians to write about you? 
  [Weizsaecker] If the historians are interested, they should 
do this job. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Thank you very much for the interview.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dietrich Zwaetz: "Speculation About Interest </F>
Rates"] 
  [Text] Sheer terror enters the pen of even sober 
commentators when they write about the latest weakness of the 
dollar. "One cent," that is, one-hundredth of a dollar, 
renowned Washington writer Hobart Rowen whines, "is now worth no 
more than one Japanese yen." Even more than this rather curious 
observation, the more or less forced attempts to explain the 
slump of the dollar to one's fellow-citizens show that textbooks 
fail when emotions rule the markets. 
  According to the textbooks, the dollar ought to be strong, 
because interest rates have been going up in the United States 
since the beginning of February, while in Germany they are going 
down. For 18 months the U.S. economy has been experiencing "an 
appropriate, if not even vigorous recovery" (Rowen), while in 
Germany and in Japan the signs of economic revival are not 
particularly dramatic. To make matters worse, however, the 
dollar is declining compared with the yen, which should actually 
be weakened because of the confusions of Japan's domestic policy 
and the new government crisis. 
  At the time of the Plaza Accord in 1985 the dollar was worth 
250 yen. At that time it was worth 2.65 German marks [DM] 
compared with the German currency. At that time the G-7 decided 
to bring the U.S. currency down to a more comfortable level, 
above all to reduce the U.S. foreign trade deficit. Looking 
back, it did not help much. 
  The most recent commentaries forget, however, that the 
dollar 
has declined to an all-time low only compared with the yen. 
Compared with the mark, the U.S. currency met its Waterloo as 
early as the fall of 1992, when the Bush Administration's 
ability to act on the economy fanned worldwide distrust in the 
dollar. At that time DM1.3850 was offered for $1. 
  Of course, the commentators admit that, in view of the 
rising 
export deficits, a weaker dollar would actually be welcome to 
the Clinton Administration. However, Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen has always denied that the Administration accepts or 
even promotes the slump of the dollar to improve the foreign 
trade results. Nor must the politician let himself be caught in 
the suspicion that he is secretly promoting the import of 
inflation in this way. 
  Instead of supporting the dollar, the United States has the 
alternative of raising interest rates. Actually, on the U.S. 
markets there is speculation only about the date of a new 
increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board -- 
whether it will be this week or after the meeting of the Open 
Market Committee on 5 and 6 July.

  [Excerpts] Following his first foreign trip since becoming 
head of government, which took him to Brussels and Paris, Mokdad 
Sifi has reiterated that the outcome of his visits were -- 
according to our colleague Noreddine Bouziane's report from 
Paris -- positive. 
  [Begin Bouziane recording] The statements Prime Minister 
Sifi 
made after his meetings with French and Belgian officials have 
indicated that his visits to Paris and Brussels have 
accomplished their goals 
  It has become clear, however, that the trip was aimed at 
achieving two things: First, to muster political support for 
the reform efforts of the Algerian authorities; and second, to 
secure financial support needed for winning the battle of 
economic reforms in Algeria. In this respect, one should say 
that Sifi will not return to Algeria empty-handed: France has 
promised Algeria 6 billion francs; the European Commission has 
indicated that it would be releasing $240 million to Algeria 
this year. 
  In his news conference, Sifi reiterated his satisfaction 
with 
the outcome of his visit to France and affirmed that the 
authorities in Algeria were not at odds with the European 
governments, which have been urging them to open a dialogue with 
the Islamic moderates. [passage omitted] 
  According to Sifi, the resolve of the authorities was still 
intact: They are still seeking dialogue with anyone who 
respects the Constitution and denounces violence. [passage 
omitted] 
  He added that the French, Belgian, and European officials he 
met during the last few days had affirmed to him their real 
support in all spheres in order to allow Algeria to overcome its 
crisis and play its role in the promotion of cooperation between 
the Arab Maghreb and Europe and the stability of the region. 
  Replying to a question on a possible rift between Paris and 
Washington, he asserted that he felt, following the Algerian 
foreign minister's visit to Washington, that there was a great 
agreement in their respective viewpoints in view of the fact 
that Algeria did not reject to broaden dialogue to other parties 
that have denounced violence. 
  For his part, Juppe has also pointed out on the same issue 
that he felt, after President Bill Clinton's recent visit to 
Paris, that there was great agreement in their respective 
viewpoints. He added: President Clinton told us he was 
supportive of the process to regain stability in Algeria as well 
as of economic reforms. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report signed "J.G.": "Algerian Prime Minister Pleads His </F>
Cause in Paris"] 
  [Text] Passing through Paris after a visit to Brussels, 
Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi had visibly two major 
concerns at a time when the Americans are very critical toward 
those in power in Algeria: On the one hand, to demonstrate that 
his country can count on the "total and unconditional support" 
of European leaders and, on the other hand, to reassure 
"everyone who might doubt the intention of the Algerian 
authorities to reestablish stability and to return eventually to 
elections." "I came to France and Belgium in order to express 
our recognition for the various forms of support those 
responsible for the European Union [EU] have given us, are 
giving us, and will give us," he emphasized at the opening of a 
news conference in Paris yesterday, describing the Algerian 
crisis as "temporary." 
  The Algerian prime minister, who met with Francois 
Mitterrand, Edouard Balladur, and Alain Juppe, pointed out to 
his interlocutors that "it was in nobody's interest for Algeria 
to remain unstable," and that "Africa's security was inseparable 
from that of the Maghreb." Aware of France's refusal to attach 
any conditions to its aid, Mokdad Sifi took advantage of this 
situation to affirm that "no agreement with the IMF or with 
Europe contained any political conditions." A position which 
does not, however, appear to be that of the EU. 
  This prime minister reaffirmed that his government had 
"opted 
for dialogue without exclusivity (i.e., including the Islamic 
parties) with everyone who rejects violence," but that it "would 
unceasingly combat those who want to destroy Algeria through 
terrorism." However, he was at pains to show that this was a 
time more of antiterrorist combat than of dialogue. "If there 
are moderates, let them come forward," he concluded, before 
recognizing that "he had no answer" to the question of why 
Abdel-kader Hachani, one of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] 
leaders, had been detained for more than two years without trial. 
  There remains the delicate problem of human rights 
violations 
and the repeated reprisals by the security forces against the 
civilian population after certain operations by the armed 
Islamic groups. "Human rights are our concern," Mokdad Sifi 
replied calmly, adding that "instructions have been given to the 
security forces not to take repressive measures, even if this 
were to lead to the failure of an operation or put their lives 
at risk." Affirmations which come at a time when several 
Algerian political parties have denounced "excesses" to 
international humanitarian organizations.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The European Union has 
promised Algeria a loan of 200 million ECUs by the end of the 
year, Prime Minister Sifi announced during a Brussels news 
conference this morning before his departure for Paris. He also 
talked about the daily violence taking place in Algeria: 
  [Begin Sifi recording] On the domestic front, we are 
determined to fight without respite against violence and 
terrorism until they are eradicated. Our external security is 
closely linked to the security of the Maghreb and the security 
of the Mediterranean region. This is why our message should be 
as clear as possible. It is in the interests of neither our 
neighbors nor our European partners that Algeria remain unstable 
for a long time or that a regime contrary to our traditions and 
human rights emerges. 
  Europe knows that and knows that it is in its interests to 
see us through. That is why we are in a hurry to reach a new 
Algerian-European cooperation agreement that takes into account 
the changes that have taken place in our economy and our new 
vision of our relations with Europe. [end recording]

  [Text] Paris, June 23 (AFP) -- France called for political 
dialogue in Algeria and elections as soon as possible, as 
Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi held a second day of talks 
with French officials on Thursday [23 June]. 
  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said France considered a 
political dialogue with "all those who agree to put their knives 
and Kalashnikovs on one side" was "indispensable". 
  Speaking after a meeting with Sifi, Juppe said France hoped 
the dialogue would culminate in legislative elections "at the 
earliest possible date." [passage omitted] 
  On Thursday, Juppe said political stabilisation in Algeria 
would depend on the success of its economic recovery programme, 
notably in improving housing and cutting unemployment. [passage 
omitted] 
  Sifi also met with National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin 
on Thursday.

  [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Now a word about Rwanda and the 
French operation or this humanitarian invasion, as Info Matin 
calls it -- is it a good thing? 
  [Giscard] [passage omitted] I think we have to look very 
carefully at this operation, which poses problems, because it is 
not a United Nations action, it is a national action being 
carried out by France. [passage omitted] Our mission is thus in 
fact a humanitarian mission, but one which must be temporary and 
extremely cautious, because Africa has responsibility for the 
situation, not Europe, much less France. [passage omitted] 
  It is a mission which has a chance only if it is strictly 
humanitarian and above all temporary, and its objective is to 
wait for the planned arrival of UN forces, which may arrive 
late. So, you see, it is an operation which must be carried out 
very carefully. The French forces must remain close to the 
border and must not penetrate into the interior of the country. 
Their mission is to protect groups of men, women, and clergy 
against the threat of massacre. It is not to take part in the 
fighting inside Rwanda.

<F P=106> [Report by Jean Leclerc du Sablon: "Paris and Beijing </F>
Envisage Cooperation in Space Technology"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- While the visit of Gerard Longuet, French 
minister of foreign trade, industry, and telecommunications, to 
China at the beginning of July risks being disappointing with 
regard to the conclusion of industrial and trading agreements, 
the French and Chinese alike are envisaging a new area of 
cooperation: space. 
  Jean-Daniel Levi, general manager of the National Space 
Research Center (CNES), which is organizing a number of meetings 
between French and Chinese space experts in Beijing and Shanghai 
this week, told LE FIGARO that the Chinese "have a real desire 
to establish cooperation ties, and we have decided to continue 
discussions and to start a series of exchanges and expert 
visits." 
  However, despite the interest of Chinese officials in this 
sector, two major manufacturers have been excluded from these 
meetings at the request of the Beijing authorities: MATRA and 
Thomson. The French gave in to Chinese demands on the advice of 
the French foreign minister. 
<H5>  Black List </H5>
  MATRA and Thomson, with Dassault, have been "blacklisted" by 
the Chinese Government because of their participation in 
contracts to supply arms, frigates, and Mirage aircraft to 
Taiwan. 
  The 12 January communique which restored Franco-Sino 
relations stated that China would open up its markets to French 
companies "on an equal footing" with companies from other 
countries. 
  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur raised this issue during a 
meeting with Li Peng, his Chinese counterpart, in Beijing in 
early April. Mr. Levi thinks that this problem will disappear 
in time. A number of French industrial groups were nonetheless 
surprised at the Chinese Government's "indelicate" handling of 
the affair. 
  The CNES head believes that possibilities for cooperation 
are 
more likely to be found in the design of satellites than in 
their launch, since the low-cost "Long March" rockets are 
already a serious competitor for the European Ariane space group. 
  The French participants did, however, note the interest 
expressed by their interlocutors in French technology and, 
ironically, in MATRA equipment in particular. They were 
received by two leading officials, Song Jian, the minister of 
the State Science and Technology Comission, and, most 
importantly, by General Ding Henggao, head of the Commission for 
Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense. This 
commission controls the Chinese counterparts of the CNES, the 
Atomic Energy Commission [CEA], and the General Air Office. 
  Gen. Ding, a member of the Central Committee who was very 
recently decorated with a third star, the supreme rank in the 
Chinese Army, was expected in Paris yesterday to attend the 
Satory Arms Fair at the invitation of French Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard. He worked with Nie Rongzhen, the "father" of 
the Chinese atom bomb, and married his daughter, Nie Li, who is 
herself a general and a leading official in the Chinese space 
industry.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Antoine-Pierre Mariano: "Survival of the </F>
Fittest"] 
  [Text] Once again, the world is in the throes of a monetary 
crisis. More precisely, of a dollar crisis, the umpteenth since 
15 August 1971, when it stopped being convertible into gold. 
  What are the symptoms? Depreciation of the dollar compared 
with the other currencies (a drop of more than 10 percent in six 
months against the franc) and a resulting drop in currency 
values on the Stock Exchange, which was almost continuous 
yesterday. There is no talk of a crash but people are thinking 
in those terms. 
  The main cause of this new collapse of the dollar is the 
increase in long-term interest rates in the United States and, 
even more, the fears of the consequences which could result from 
this upward readjustment of interest rates. In short, the 
operators fear they have reason to be afraid. 
  Two observations: 

  -  The European Monetary System, in its 
adjusted form set up last summer, is holding firm. That is a 
good sign; 
  -  The drop in interest rates on the markets is being 
carried out without any panic. Small bearers now know that will 
only lose if they sold and they are accustomed to weathering 
squalls. 

  However, this new summer storm ought not to be taken 
lightly. 
It is particularly unwelcome at a time when we are seeing that 
the recovery of European economies well underway. 
  Edouard Balladur, who yesterday explained his policies for 
the next six months, has tried to be reassuring. It is true 
that, if you simply looked at the economic indicators of the 
French economy and the forecasts of the independent 
institutions, there would be no objective reason for the Stock 
Exchange falling. But, if the disturbances were to persist, they 
would eventually jeopardize this recovery. Investors do not 
like troubled times and, in the long run, a de facto devaluation 
of the dollar would jeopardize all the international activities 
of the United States' trading partners, be it sales of Airbus 
planes or oil, Ariane launch costs, or the purchasing power of 
raw materials exporters. The United States is therefore giving 
itself a considerable commercial advantage beside which the 
concessions it has from GATT are insignificant. It is survival 
of the fittest. 
  However, it is considered certain that, after spectacular 
interventions by the central banks to curb the speculation and 
perhaps the few records which will be registered by the traders, 
order will be restored. Only those who lost their cool and 
hastily rid themselves of a hot potato will come off badly. 
Others will have gained that lost money. 
  The world will only avoid these recurrent monetary crises 
when everybody lives within their means and when a coherent 
exchange system is established. There is no need to reinvent a 
single standard, but if we started by creating a few simple 
mechanisms which would organize the floating of currencies or 
would penalize speculation, we would at least avoid a great deal 
of chaos. 
  That can be done at any time. On one condition: provided 
Washington is willing.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Financial Storms"] </F>
  [Text] The dollar's slide to below the 100-yen mark on 
Monday, 27 June shows that the week which has just begun will be 
heavy with new and dangerous storms on the financial markets. 
The crisis of confidence of international investors in the 
economic and monetary policies of the three major industrial 
powers (the United States, Germany, and Japan) began in 
February. It was to continue, severely threatening American 
growth. It is compromising recovery in Japan and Europe. 
  Tension is running extremely high among dealers, who are 
waiting expectantly for a hike in short-term American interest 
rates. While waiting for this action from the Federal Reserve, 
agitation can be expected to continue both in the bond markets 
and on the stock exchanges. A brutal fall in the U.S. currency 
or in share prices is no doubt out of the question, but 
pessimism and doubt remain the order of the day, auguring what 
some are beginning to call a hidden crash. 
  The concerted intervention by 17 central banks led by the 
Federal Reserve on Friday, 24 June, ended in bitter failure. 
Despite the $3 billion or so thrown into the battle, the 
greenback once again lost value. It has lost 10 percent of its 
value against the yen and 9 percent against the German mark 
since the beginning of the year. This serious reverse suffered 
by the monetary authorities underlines how much their tactical 
sense has failed them. By waiting too long to intervene so as 
not to prove the markets who were calling for action from them 
to be right, they enabled speculators to make tidy profits 
without, however, arresting the fall. 
  Beyond this, it is visibly their whole credibility which 
this 
crisis is calling into question. The messages between central 
banks and the markets are not getting across any more. Every 
movement on short-term rates is misinterpreted. The meaning of 
every declaration is twisted. Financial circles are maintaining 
a sense of alarm which can no longer be taken lightly, given its 
serious threat to economies. 
  The White House's declarations this weekend indicating that 
the dollar was not a weapon in the trade war with Japan go in 
the right direction. It finally appears that the level achieved 
by the yen, which is now worth 1 U.S. cent, is considered 
sufficient by Washington. Despite everything, it will need more 
than that to convince traders. The G-7 meeting, to be held 
between 8 and 10 July in Naples, could provide an opportunity if 
the date did not appear too distant. 
  In the meantime, the markets would like a hike in U.S. 
short-term rates and a fall in Europe, just as the Fed and the 
Bundesbank have decided on a pause. The central banks are 
trapped, because giving in immediately to the markets would 
weaken their long-term credibility. While remaining inflexible, 
it remains the job of the political and monetary authorities to 
remind people constantly that the fundamentals of the world 
economy do not justify the present panic.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Robert Toubon] </F>
  [Text] It has been said of Francois Mitterrand in 
connection with the Socialist Party -- will Jacques Delors also 
leave Europe in the very state it was in when he came aboard, 
that is, prone to recurring crises and unable to find itself a 
Commission president? 
  Ten years ago, Margaret Thatcher would not hear of 
appointing 
France's Claude Cheysson. Today, John Major vetoes the 
appointment of Belgian Jean-Luc Dehaene. It is no fluke that 
the Brussels machine should once again be paralyzed by a loose 
British cog. While beleaguered Tory governments have indeed been 
in the habit of resorting to anti-European posturing to improve 
their standing at home, such an explanation tends to fall 
somewhat short of the mark and in any case clouds the real 
issue: Twenty-one years after joining the Common Market, the 
British have in no way given up their notion of a liberal Europe 
wide open to the rest of the world, and they do not want to miss 
the opportunity, so thoughtfully offered to them by the 
Franco-German tandem, to remind the rest of Europe that the UK 
is no more "interventionist" or "federalist" than it ever was. 
  To be sure, one can argue that Europe has known other crises 
and that it will weather this one as it has previous ones. 
Undoubtedly, but in what shape will it come out of it? 
Because, unlike what used to happen when Europe bounced back 
unscathed from one deadlock to the next, today each new 
difficulty damages it further. 
  Europe is not in too good a shape, and it has only itself to 
blame: While it was politically viable with six members, this 
became a lot less true with nine, and then with 12 members. No 
one knows how it can govern itself with 16 members, and a Europe 
from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains, as asked for by 
Boris Yeltsin in Corfu, would -- at best -- never be more than a 
broad free-trade zone. The founding fathers' spiritual heirs 
may be saddened by this while Euroskeptics may rejoice, but the 
fact remains that such an evolution is only natural. In the 
political realm, the word for gluttony is voluntarism, but the 
results are always the same: indigestion, followed by a forced 
diet of lighter food. Because they wanted to go too far, too 
fast, Jacques Delors and Francois Mitterrand may go down in 
history not as self-styled initiators of the great European 
breakthrough, but as sorcerer's apprentices who only presided 
over a return to reality. Like the human body, history has its 
own rhythms which seldom fit such a short period of time as one 
or even two seven-year presidential terms.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Philippe Marcovici] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Rwanda's tragedy could have, 
or rather should have, crystallized the European idea around a 
simple notion: to rescue innocent victims. This was an 
opportunity for Europe to put words into practice and to assume 
a common purpose. But no such thing has taken place. On the 
contrary, Europe is but an indifferent, not to say reluctant, 
witness to a humanitarian rescue operation which it is letting 
France perform alone. At France's peril, but also to its credit. 
  There are those who diffidently promise some logistical 
support, or a few packages of supplies. Italy, which initially 
appeared to support France's initiative, is now setting down 
conditions. Belgium, whose involvement in Rwanda was deep, 
maintains that it will not send a single man. Great Britain 
hears nothing, sees nothing, says nothing. As for Germany, it 
is hiding behind its constitution, a convenient and customary 
alibi for doing nothing. As for all the others they are 
reneging. In short, Europe is missing at a time when one of its 
own members, France, is resolutely committing itself. [passage 
omitted] 
  People will find it difficult to forget that, when the hour 
required some generosity, courage, and responsibility, Europe 
was nowhere to be seen. Such is not the case of France, 
however. It is showing by force of example that a nation 
remains a nation and that it still knows how to act alone when 
danger is knocking at the door. 
  Europe has proved unable to fulfil the promises made in 
Maastricht. Too bad. Because it is shouldering this burden 
alone, France should not refrain from a feeling of pride at 
having upheld its traditions. France is coming to the rescue of 
a people in mortal danger. It does not matter whether it has 
partners or not. What does matter is for it to succeed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi by Renato </F>
Farina in Rome; date not given: "Bossi Has Destroyed, I Will 
Rebuild" -- first three paragraphs are IL GIORNALE introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- At the Palazzo Chigi [office of the 
prime minister] the Council of Ministers session was over. So 
was the news conference. He was about to leave for Corfu when he 
was presented with our questions, which he wanted to see in 
writing first. Let us be frank: [Prime Minister] Berlusconi 
was in no mood for smiles. I think he felt like running away 
into the garden, into the forest, to beat his chest and shout 
barbarically: To hell with everyone -- [passage omitted] to 
hell with them. And to hell the ministers too, who are undoing 
rather than doing, saying the things they should not rather than 
the things they should. He must just have finished scolding his 
ministers -- not all of them, but the "ancien regime" ones. For 
the present he has told them to keep silent, though in one case 
particular he would gladly be rid of him too. 
  We found him in this angry state, though it was also a 
fortunate moment, because he seemed like someone who has just 
begun cleaning up. This, because he is convinced that the 
problem lies within the "Rome bureaucracy." And although there 
are enemies there who are obstructing him, there are also the 
desires of the band that he dragged behind him, that not only 
flatter him but also envy him (though he never admits it, and 
always defends his supporters). In order to breathe freely, Mr. 
Berlusconi had to look outside, out of the window, because he is 
absolutely confident of being loved by everyone on the other 
side of that wall. And how can we deny it? 
  He had government spokesman Giuliano Ferrara with him, and 
they made a strange couple. By saying so I may risk being 
strangled by one of them. But they are like Beauty and the 
Beast. Do not ask which is which. You decide: In modern 
soccer, strategy is important, but so is imagination. 
Eventually the spokesman left the voice on his own, and he 
replied precisely and determinedly. As Mr. Berlusconi knew, the 
occasion of the interview was IL GIORNALE's 20th birthday. 
  [Farina] How are you, Prime Minister? I ask you that because 
sometimes you seem to me more anxious than you were to start 
with. Have you discovered a hgher debt than you expected? Are 
you disappointed in your allies? What is wrong? 
  [Berlusconi] No. I am happy. Because I am confident that I 
have done my country a great service by saving it from a future 
without freedom and without prosperity that seemed to be 
ordained. As for the government's activity and the state 
budget, I will be happier -- or I hope so, at least -- when I 
have detailed figures on privatization. In a few hours' time we 
will know better how much the state will bring in this year. I 
have always thought that the state should be managed like a 
family, like a business. So, much of my satisfaction will 
depend on people's tax returns and how they are completed. 
  [Farina] Someone like you must of course have a good 
business 
consultant. 
  [Berlusconi] This is no joking matter. I am talking about 
the Italian people's tax returns. It is on them that the 
government's budget and therefore action depend. 
  [Farina] Yes, the government's action. Is the alliance 
working? 
  [Berlusconi] In coalitions, sometimes it rains, sometimes it 
hails. I have a patient nature, and am only alarmed by natural 
disasters. Apart from that, I am proceeding, and trying to keep 
my promises to the voters, which is something that should not 
displease any of my allies. 
  [Farina] You mentioned pledges to the voters. I must tell, 
you that, despite the extraordinary popularity that all your 
opinion polls attribute to you, you do not seem to be making 
much use of this favorable situation to honor these pledges. In 
other words, you are not making many decisions. Or am I 
mistaken? 
  [Berlusconi] I try to reach thought-out decisions. When I 
think that more time is needed, I do not allow myself to be 
seized by anxiety and to act hastily. Haste has created 
monsters that cannot even be imagined. It was enough for me to 
take a look at the political apparatus in Rome, its budgets and 
its crazy spending, to realize this. Be that as it may, in 
these first 40 days of work we have pondered sufficiently, and 
now we will make plenty of decisions. 
  [Farina] Yes, but hitherto.... 
  [Berlusconi] Let it be clear that we have worked hard and 
made plenty of decisions. Shall I give you a list? 1) We have 
privatized the INA [National Insurance Institute], which is the 
biggest insurance company. 2) We have set back in motion 
procedures for contracts with the public sector. 3) We have 
also devised a new fiscal policy, which will stimulate instead 
of punish tax payers, and create new jobs. That is not all, but 
it is not inconsiderable. 
  [Farina] Is it or is it not true that you are prepared to 
hold an early election? 
  [Berlusconi] No. I consider the work of the government and 
the majority my exclusive task. 
  [Farina] Can you guarantee a government that will last the 
duration of the legislative term, as [League Secretary] Bossi is 
demanding? 
  [Berlusconi] I will answer you this way: In mature 
democracies politicians -- at least those with a clean 
conscience who do their duty -- are always ready to leave. And 
they can ask the voters to express their preferences at any time. 
  [Farina] Perhaps so that they can run again with new allies. 
Sometimes -- I remember [passage omitted] your dismay at 
Bossi's "double-crossing" -- you have seemed to regret your 
failure to forge an alliance with the Popular Party [PPI]. Its 
leaders, however, ask themselves why they should consign 
themselves to your embrace and thus condemn themselves to death. 
  [Berlusconi] Anyone who thinks that in a country such as 
ours 
the Christian tradition can die in anyone's embrace is mistaken. 
There are certain things that remain, and one of these is the 
Catholic presence in politics. But this presence no longer has 
only the characteristics of the past! It can no longer stand as 
the Catholics' sole party! Moreover, the PPI is, or should be, 
the agent of a great return to Sturzo. And Sturzo embodied much 
of the liberal attitude that inspires me and the movement that I 
have founded. 
  [Farina] So Forza Italia will consume the PPI in the name of 
Sturzo, father of all. 
  [Berlusconi] Not at all. I do not want to absorb or take 
over anyone. I want my interlocutors to not be in their death 
throes, but merely friendly allies willing to implement common 
objectives, within the framework of common values and principles. 
  [Farina] Although you are so magnanimous toward the PPI, do 
you not feel some sense of guilt toward the League? The League, 
in particular, brought down the old system, and then you arrived 
on horseback like Napoleon at Jena. Is this just? 
  [Berlusconi] I have always been generous in the 
acknowledgements that I think are due to the Northern League and 
the northern movement. I, too, am a northerner. I was pleased 
to see their establishment at a time when many people attacked 
them with all kinds of insults. If I might be so bold, I would 
say that the first television stations to present a less 
familiar and steroetypic image of the League were mine. Mr. 
Bossi has acknowledged this publicly. But permit me to say 
this: Yes, it is true, they attack the old system with an 
exceptional democratic vigor. But when a system no longer 
functions, the task is not to turn it into a pile of rubble. It 
is necessary to transcend that system, to reform it, to replace 
it with something different. And this is precisely what I am 
trying to do. 
  [Farina] Federalism is part of the League's social policy: 
Will you, as prime minister, pledge yourself to this? And the 
National Alliance is in favor of a presidential system. Do you 
favor such a system, Prime Minister? 
  [Berlusconi] I think that the direct election of the head of 
government would be a good thing. But this is still a political 
opinion and not yet a policy of the government or the majority. 
Such a reform would be all the more useful in a country that 
were to decide, as I think ours should, to grant powers of a 
federal nature to its regional organizations. 
  [Farina] You have placed much emphasis on a new electoral 
law 
that will "make it possible to govern." What time scale do you 
envision? And with which allies? 
  [Berlusconi] Spring, next spring. This is the time set by 
the referendum, which should take place then, if approved by the 
Constitutional Court. As for allies, I of course depend on the 
government majority for any policy, including the electoral 
laws. But as you are well aware, this is an area in which the 
frankest possible dialogue with the opposition is always useful 
and some times even indispensable. 
  [Farina] Let us talk about opinion polls. Do you not think 
that things are going rather too far? This, because people will 
think: So, in order to be in charge it is enough to have a 
mechanism that will summarize the Italian people's thinking at 
any particular time. Do you remember Pontius Pilate? He acted 
in accordance with the result of the opinion poll, and he saved 
Barabbas and crucified Jesus. Often common sense does not make 
good sense. Mr. Berlusconi, will you have the courage to make 
unpopular decisions? 
  [Berlusconi] I see that you, too, make jokes about the 
opinion polls or about my credulity or excessive attention to 
their results. That is so easy to do. Some say I pay too much 
heed to what people think. But they forget that I am perfectly 
able to decide against the trend. Few people predicted my 
success when I decided to enter politics. It would be grotesque 
and also a mistake to do always and only what you assume people 
think; but to ignore the opinion of the majority is a sign of 
arrogance and contempt for the ordinary life of the most 
advanced democracies. 
  [Farina] The life of democracies, you say. What is it 
composed of? In one interview you surprised everyone by 
speaking out against unprincipled consumerism. What kind of 
society do you have in mind? The Utopia of Thomas More? Could 
you describe it, as you would to a child? 
  [Berlusconi] Believe me, unprincipled consumerism is a moral 
nightmare for me. I see an anonymous mass of people who buy, 
spend, and increase their assets without any idea of why they do 
so, without a feeling of real joy in living. In fact, in a 
prosperous and calm country consumption signifies the free 
exercise of a human right, to do so within a community or family 
context, with a sense of belonging to a society and common 
values. I do not know whether what I am saying is utopian, but 
I hope that I have been clear. 
  [Farina] Please make a further effort. 
  [Berlusconi] Well, I will tell you that the society that I 
have in mind, and that I dream of, is not an artificial society 
of purchasers and performers. If I may say so, this is a 
caricature of Berlusconism, an "ism" defined by my tireless 
ideological adversaries but not by me. 
  [Farina] Everyone will expect a question, and an answer from 
you, about the near future of Fininvest's television channels. 
Has any progress been made? Can you say anything more than you 
did a week ago? 
  [Berlusconi] There is nothing new in this regard. The only 
news would be if everyone were to recognize the fact that we 
are, and will remain, a free country, with a free press and free 
television, with a monitoring system that prevents any abuses. 
The Italian people are convinced of this, and vote accordingly. 
  [Farina] Are you not afraid of excessive flattery on the 
part 
of those who are "too" friendly? And on the part of last-minute 
converts? Or do you consider this a minimum repayment for the 
injustices of the past? 
  [Berlusconi] Flattery is always unpleasant, but in any case 
I 
demand neither compliments nor repayments, because basically, 
amid the storms of criticisms, I have received a great deal from 
public and private life. Politeness does not displease me: I 
always try to be polite to other people, and I expect the same, 
though I know that I am bound to suffer some disappointments in 
this regard. But never mind. 
  [Farina] What pleasant surprises have there been for you as 
prime minister? 
  [Berlusconi] A government team composed of competent people 
who are enthusiastic about what they do. 
  [Farina] What about Forza Italia? It is not clear whether 
you want to keep it as a diffuse movement or to develop it into 
a party. Or do you have in mind, rather, a giant party that 
will absorb the whole of the center-right? Do you want to move 
on from a two-alignment to a two-party system? 
  [Berlusconi] There are non so blind as those who will not 
see. 
  [Farina] There are also some stubborn people, as well as 
dishonest people. In any case, there are differing ideas 
circulating within your grouping. 
  [Berlusconi] Look, I did not want to be discourteous. But as 
far as Forza Italia is concerned, I have said repeatedly that 
the last thing we need is a new professional political 
apparatus. I am in favor of a party modeled on clearly-defined 
and strong institutions; I am in favor of the primacy of elected 
representatives and of the movement's representatives within the 
public administration. Then there is the aspect of a system of 
associations, which is important. It is not merely a matter of 
having electoral committees: Forza Italia is something more 
than that; it is also a community of shared principles and 
attitudes, but it is not, and must not become, a party in the 
traditional sense. It is not true at all that I am -- as Galli 
della Loggia wrongly wrote --a monarch surrounded by unimportant 
courtiers. I am the leader of a newly-born movement, and this 
grants particular strength to the leadership, as is natural. A 
good political scientist should know these things. 
  [Farina] As you know, this interview was organized to mark 
the 20th anniversary of IL GIORNALE. Would you please give a 
description of each of the figures -- either from IL GIORNALE or 
other journalists -- that I will name? 
  [Berlusconi] I will try. 
  [Farina] Indro Montanelli. 
  [Berlusconi] An old friend, who has treated me very badly, 
but whom I miss. 
  [Farina] Vittorio Feltri. 
  [Berlusconi] A new friend, who knows how to do his job in a 
modern and honest manner.' 
  [Farina] Enzo Biagi. 
  [Berlusconi] A professional expert. 
  [Farina] Giorgio Bocca. 
  [Berlusconi] Talented but bigoted. 
  [Farina] Last, Eugenio Scalfari. 
  [Berlusconi] The editor of LA REPUBBLICA. 
  [Farina] Is that all? 
  [Berlusconi] You asked me for a definition, not for a book, 
did you not? 
  [Farina] What has IL GIORNALE meant for you, and what does 
it 
mean for you now? 
  [Berlusconi] In the seventies, when that ugly beast, 
conformism, roamed wild, IL GIORNALE provided an example. My 
family and I had the honor to raise the flag which others 
allowed to fall. No management costs are too high for an 
enterprise that embodied such important values. I no longer 
have any kind of connection with IL GIORNALE. I have nothing to 
do with it from any viewpoint --either with regard to editorial 
management or with regard to its interpretation and reporting of 
events. But I do read it, and will continue to do so. Indeed, 
I am what is called a faithful reader. 
  [Farina] Well, I do not know whether that is the right term, 
but thanks!

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F>
Guido Passalacqua in Milan; date not given: "Bossi: `What 
Elections...?'-- `If the Government Falls, a New One Can Be 
Formed"] 
  [Text] Milan -- Following a series of negative election 
results, the League is now again a winner. In a number of 
Lombard municipalities where, as [League Secretary] Umberto 
Bossi said, "our roots are strongest," the Bandwagon [League 
nickname] defeated Forza Italia. This signals the reversal of a 
trend -- a reversal which began, Bossi said, "on that 25 April 
when I marched alone in the midst of insults and catcalls. It 
was not a comfortable choice, but I had to make it." Does this, 
then, confirm that the Senator's [Bossi nickname] strategy (say 
things clearly, highlight the League's specific identity, 
identify Forza Italia as a conservative party while 
simultaneously ensuring "governability") is beginning to bear 
fruit? Speaking from his home in Gemonio, in the early 
afternoon, Bossi tended to minimize events: "So, you want me to 
make a statement about such a small development? This was only 
a victory of the line based on reason." He then went on to call 
a press conference in Milan. He spoke calmly, but his message 
was unequivocal: Elections are not imminent, the League is 
"alive and well," and finally "the League cannot agree with a 
British-type single-round system." 
  [Passalacqua] Deputy Bossi, are you finally satisfied? 
  [Bossi] I have always anticipated things well in advance. I 
seen no reason now to overemphasize the election results (In the 
course of the press conference, he repeatedly put forward this 
idea -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) but we are of course 
receiving the right signals, a small signal perhaps, but I 
believe we are getting some results. 
  [Passalacqua] After this election round, do you think early 
elections are now closer or further away? 
  [Bossi] In my opinion [Prime Minister] Berlusconi's problem 
is how to prevent governability from becoming the only asset 
enabling him to win votes. In this country, governability is 
guaranteed, safe. The League has no intention of calling it 
into question. 
  [Passalacqua] Not everybody in the majority shares this 
view. 
  [Bossi] If you like, their reckoning is legitimate. 
  [Passalacqua] Legitimate but dangerous... 
  [Bossi] It is others who reckon in this way. There is a 
danger that Italy may become the European country facing the 
greatest difficulties, that it may move from one election to the 
next. When governability is not at stake, or when it becomes 
more difficult to invoke it, then people demand values and 
consistency. Look at what happened in Desio and Lissone, two 
small towns near to where Forza Italia's leader lives. Voters 
there preferred the League because they realized that when both 
the League and Forza Italia guarantee governability, then ideals 
and values must be rewarded, and when it comes to ideals and 
values, we are unrivaled. Future battles will be fought on 
values and consistency, particularly when people realize that 
there are several government possibilities. 
  [Passalacqua] However, are early elections close or distant, 
in your opinion? 
  [Bossi] They are much more distant today. This parliament 
must complete its term. I like to keep my word, and I believe 
the other allies have a stake in this, too. 
  [Passalacqua] You referred to several government 
possibilities. What exactly did you mean? 
  [Bossi] I think the Freedom Alliance must be able to govern. 
We helped Berlusconi to form a government. If this were 
otherwise, the country might take a dangerous path. However, 
the League maintains that democratic practice must be followed. 
If we suddenly realize that the allies are aiming for early 
elections, we will insist on democratic practice being 
respected. This is why the League opposes the resignation of 
the RAI's [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] know-it-alls. 
Whatever steps are taken or not taken, there is a law saying 
that, until 1995, appointments are decided by [Chamber of 
Deputies speaker] Pivetti and [Senate speaker] Scognamiglio. 
Therefore it is right for the know-it-alls to retain their posts. 
  [Passalacqua] What do you mean by "practice?" 
  [Bossi] If anyone resigns, institutional practice 
establishes 
that someone else will govern. When a pope dies, another one is 
elected. I repeat, there is no chance of going to the polls. I 
have the impression that false statements are being made about 
Berlusconi in the press. This is why I intend to ask him 
myself, personally. I believe there are people engaged in 
slander and exaggeration campaigns. 
  [Passalacqua] In these elections, the League has both given 
and taken votes from the Left. Are these the first steps along 
the path you have marked out? 
  [Bossi] You are forgetting the center. In any case, the 
League wanted to ensure the protest proposal would prevail. We 
do not agree with throwing the country into chaos. We are not 
pleased with the prospect. You see, the voters' support cannot 
be diverted at will: Voters have rewarded a political force -- 
in a limited test -- whose values can be shared. When Forza 
Italia and the League stand side by side, people vote for the 
League. 
  [Passalacqua] Do you believe these elections have bolstered 
your position in favor of a two-round electoral system? 
  [Bossi] Advocating two rounds does not depend on election 
results. Rather, it results from a decision, namely the 
decision not to support a single-party system. A double-round 
system would enable a political force to retain its identity and 
then enter into a coalition so as to ensure governability.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Antonio Polito: "Less Tactics, More </F>
Goals..."] 
  [Text] So an election in the fall is a possibility. Or, at 
least, this was not ruled out by Silvio Berlusconi, who at the 
Confcommercio [General Confederation of Italian Merchants and 
Shopkeepers] conference yesterday replied with a significant "no 
comment" to a journalist who asked him explicitly about it. 
Late yesterday evening his spokesman denied that his silence 
constituted an expression of assent. But the proper 
interpretation lies in the axiom on which the prime minister 
earlier centered his political argument -- that is, that the 
present electoral law prevents him from governing. The 
conclusion is that he needs a new electoral law before he can 
govern. 
  And an electoral law is a pressing necessity only if another 
election is imminent. In any case, this newspaper has already 
revealed this desire for an election on Sunday. Today Pilo 
himself -- the high priest of opinion polls -- recounted to LA 
REPUBBLICA the long hours spent at [Berlusconi's residence] 
Arcore evaluating the figures applying to Berlusconi's "magic 
moment." 
  It is very likely that we are right: If an election were to 
take place now, especially with a single-round system with no 
proportional quota, Forza Italia would swallow [League 
Secretary] Bossi whole and half of [National Alliance leader] 
Fini, and would undermine the Popular Party a little more. So 
an election in November would benefit Berlusconi. But, if we 
may be permitted to ask, would it benefit the country? 
  The first uncertainty that arises concerns the desirability 
of starting such a debate, which certainly does not constitute 
evidence of the solidity of the majority, in the midst of a 
currency crisis in which, in our case, the credibility and 
reliability of the government are at stake. Perhaps in order to 
reassure the markets it would have been more advisable to adopt 
a resolute stance in defense of the treasury minister and his 
desire to keep public spending under control, even if it means 
introducing an additional economic package during the course of 
the year, the unpopularity of which is very easy to predict. 
  The second uncertainty concerns the need for another general 
election. Usually they are justified -- and the president can 
only call them for this sole reason -- in the presence of a 
parliament that is incapable of promulgating laws, without a 
majority, and unable to provide an alternative. But this does 
not seem to be the situation, even though Berlusconi has had, 
and may still have, problems in the Senate. In sincere and even 
somewhat disarming terms, the leader of the left-wing opposition 
in the Senate pointed out that hitherto he has had no 
opportunity to stand "either with or against the government's 
proposals: We seek them but do not find them." There is some 
truth in this: The government was sworn in 1 May, and since 
then not a single measure has been turned down by the 
opposition. The only upheavals have occurred within the 
majority itself -- over the INPS [National Social Security 
Institute] and the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation]. 
  The third uncertainty concerns the political legitimacy of 
another election so soon after a historic election conducted 
under a new electoral system, which raised so many hopes in the 
majority of Italians, who brought Berlusconi to the Palazzo 
Chigi [office of the prime minister]. We do not deny that 
Bossi's bluster may be annoying for the prime minister and -- we 
fear for the League -- for the voters, too. But so far there 
has been no more than that -- a great deal of skirmishing, with 
no substance. For that matter, even in the most radical 
first-past-the-post system, such as Britain's, poor Mr. Major 
has to deal with the fringes of his parliamentary base (and they 
are all Conservatives there; the single party of the Right 
already exists.) And even in the United States, which elects 
its head of government directly, Bill Clinton has to earn the 
vote of each individual Congress member or senator, day after 
day. Democracies -- including those that emphasize the right of 
the executive to govern -- are a constant exercise in consensus, 
both in the country as a whole and in parliament. If only, at 
least, a new election were not to serve solely to increase what 
Galli della Loggia in yesterday's CORRIERE DELLA SERA described 
as "the plebiscitary-charismatic legitimization of the 
parliamentary majority from above, its exclusive appointment by 
royal investiture." 
  The government is faced with many things that need to be 
done, and that need to be done at once. Both what we could call 
the more traditional things, such as reorganizing the public 
accounts, deciding how and when to introduce an additional 
economic package, how and when to impose additional income tax 
in order to fill the gap created by the ruling on pensions, 
whether to compensate with an increase in the price of 
cigarettes for the reimbursement of the 85,000 lire medical tax. 
And also what we could call more innovative things, comprised 
in the government's program and based on the economic liberalism 
which Italy, tired of the Christian Democratic regime, has so 
clearly shown that it appreciates -- from the million new jobs 
to the reduction of fiscal pressure. Well, let it do them 
before airing the possibility of another election. 
  In order to bring his ministers, who too often issue 
conflicting messages, into line, Berlusconi needs not another 
election, but simply Article 95 of the Constitution: "The prime 
minister directs the government's general policy and is 
responsible for it." In other words, this is his job. If, 
then, Bossi abandons his lion's roars in favor of parliamentary 
ambushes, or if what remains of the opposition is able to 
obstruct the path to the country's recovery and renewal, then 
the prime minister will be fully entitled to ask the president 
to call another election. But if that happens, we will at least 
know why we have been summoned to vote again. 
  Unfortunately we have no idea what Pilo thinks about it, but 
the impression is that the Italian people are now hungrier for 
government than they are for the arguments of political 
scientists about how they are to be governed. It is rather like 
in [soccer coach] Sacchi's Italy: We would all welcome rather 
fewer strategic lessons about how to play without a ball and 
prefer to see a few more balls in the adversary's goal.

  [Text] Portugal's foreign, economic, and industrial 
policies will be a key point at today's meeting of the PPE 
[European Popular Party] being held near Lisbon. Foreign 
Minister Durao Barroso addressed the meeting a few moments ago. 
Walter Medeiros reports. 
  [Medeiros] Barroso's speech started with strong praise for 
Lucas Pires. Then he praised Europe and Portugal's role within 
it. Durao Barroso stressed that Portugal is European, without 
ambiguity, and that it joined the European Community not for 
economically driven and merely financical reasons, but with 
clearly political objectives. 
  Then came a warning: Durao Barroso said the enlargement -- 
of 
course -- but also the mechanisms that depend on the transition 
of this enlargement, must not jeopardize the effectiveness of 
the European Union [EU]. 
  [Begin Barroso recording] We believe that the adaptation of 
the Union's institutions and decisionmaking mechanisms to the 
needs of the enlargement to other European states must not mean 
a loss of effectiveness within the European Union, or, as many 
wish, it must not contribute to turning the European Union into 
an extended area of free exchange [as heard]. [end recording] 
  [Medeiros] The future is unknown, but there is a safe port 
called Europe, Durao Barroso said. It is necessary to defend 
safe values such as Europe, and it would be a mistake not to do 
so, he added.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Dinfo Comes to an End"] </F>
  [Text] The government has decided to wind up the Dinfo 
[Military Intelligence Division] and to merge the Military 
Intelligence Service [SIM] and the Strategic Defense 
Intelligence Service [SIED]. The decision emerges from a bill 
to which EXPRESSO has had access and that [Defense Minister] 
Fernando Nogueira sent to the Assembly of the Republic yesterday 
afternoon. According to the document, the new department will 
come directly under the prime minister, through the minister 
with the relevant portfolio. 
  The government seeks through this initiative to improve the 
efficiency of the external security services -- whether of a 
military, strategic, or economic nature -- adjusting that aim to 
the material and human resources with which they are provided. 
To this end, it proposes not only the existence of a smaller 
number of officials but also the setting up of a single 
department, having in mind improving the conditions of work and 
of performing tasks. 
  The new body, which will be called the Strategic Defense and 
Military Intelligence Services (SIEDM), will result from the 
merger of the current SIM and the SIED, which, despite being 
enshrined in the current law, was never set up. 
  According to Framework Law on the Intelligence Service of 
the 
Republic (SIR), there are currently three departments taking 
part in the areas of the country's internal and external 
security -- the Intelligence and Security Service (coming under 
the minister of internal administration, it is devoted to 
internal security), the SIM (which includes the Dinfo and comes 
under the defense minister through the Armed Forces chief of 
staff -- CEMGFA), and the CIED, which exists only in law. 
<H5>  New Rules for Military Intelligence Agents </H5>
  With Fernando Nogueira's new proposed change, the Dinfo 
(which is still responsible for the defense of the country 
against an external threat) and the CEMGFA disappear from this 
structure. Despite the Armed Forces chief's removal from the tip 
of the SIM's leadership pyramid, military personnel will 
continue to make up the new body's cadres, except that they will 
not be able to exceed 50 percent of the SIEDM's personnel or be 
placed in a position other than that of a mere service 
commission. Moreover, this will be the case with the civilians 
to be recruited from the public administration, the ranks of the 
judges and the state attorney's office, and the diplomatic corps. 
  In addition, military personnel who serve their service 
commissions in the SIEDM will be subject not to Armed Forces 
regulations but to those of the body itself. Through this 
measure, Fernando Nogueira allays certain concerns expressed by 
the opposition parties during the contacts that he had with them 
last year. At those meetings, some party representatives 
expressed misgivings about the excessive presence of military 
personnel in the SIEDM and their activity. 
  However, as is common in other countries, the Armed Forces 
will have just one military intelligence division (DIMIL), 
intended to gather any specific operational intelligence -- not 
any intelligence of a strategic nature. Even so, and in order 
to reassure the opposition parties, Fernando Nogueira inserts in 
the bill an article providing, within this vast restructuring, 
that the Intelligence Services Oversight Council will assess the 
DIMIL's reports. 
  So this is a kind of guarantee assuring politicians that the 
military personnel will not exceed their duties within the 
strict operational framework that will be assigned to them.

  [Excerpts] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, has started his official visit to Spain with 
an audience with King Juan Carlos. Elizabeta Gojan reports from 
Madrid. 
  [Gojan] [passage omitted] Spain's interest in the peaceful 
reintegration of the occupied Croatian regions, the situation in 
the area, Croatia's contribution to the ending of the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the aid extended by the European Union and 
Spain to the concrete implementation of the agreement on the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation -- these subjects were discussed 
this afternoon by Minister Granic and Javier Solana Madariaga, 
his Spanish counterpart. 
  [Begin recording] [Solana, in Spanish with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] As far as the Croatian regions 
under Serb occupation are concerned, the Spanish side will meet 
again this summer with high-ranking Croatian officials. 
  We wish to agree on influencing a possible renewal of the 
mandate of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] before the autumn 
session of the UN General Assembly. 
  Spanish-Croatian relations have significantly improved, 
although they were not all that good in the past. 
  [Granic] Despite the Zagreb cease-fire agreement, there have 
been no further negotiations with the Serbs. On the contrary -- 
the UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] are being practically integrated 
into Serbia economically. Croatia refuses to accept this. 
Croatia will try -- in a peaceful and diplomatic way -- to 
resolve the issue of the reintegration of our occupied regions 
by requesting the help of the European Union and the UN General 
Assembly and Security Council. 
  As far as Bosnia-Herzegovina is concerned, Croatia upholds 
the Washington agreement and the Bosnian-Croat Federation -- 
including the future confederation between the Muslim-Croat 
Federation and the Republic of Croatia -- as well as the Contact 
Group's efforts aimed at finding a peaceful solution. [end 
recording] 
  [Gojan] The two ministers signed the first agreements 
between 
their two countries on road traffic and cooperation in the area 
of tourism. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Isidre Ambros and Pau Baquero: "Gonzalez Admits </F>
That There Is a Crisis in Council's Functioning"] 
  [Text] Corfu -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez 
acknowledged yesterday that the European leaders' failure in 
their attempt to agree on a candidate to replace Delors 
represents "a clear crisis in the European Council's 
functioning," while admitting that the veto imposed by John 
Major could lead to an institutional conflict to which "I can 
see no easy solution." 
  The news conference at which Gonzalez analyzed the Corfu 
Council virtually centered on the issue of the candidate to 
succeed Delors as Commission president. Gonzalez acknowledged 
that the summit's outcome produced an outcome that was 
"bittersweet with evident light and shade." 
  The Spanish head of government explained his efforts to try 
to reach a consensus among the Twelve. During the dinner on 
Friday [24 June] evening, Gonzalez said that he believed that 
there was an agreement for nobody to veto anybody, "which seemed 
to me a very good thing. We delegations accepted the 
presidency's proposal that we vote according to preference. 
There were 11 ballot papers with the order of the three 
candidates and one on which there were just two candidates, and 
none of them was Brittan." 
  Yesterday morning, Gonzalez met with Lubbers, "and I asked 
him to withdraw," as Brittan also did, but Major maintained his 
veto, but not the Netherlands, which said that it was prepared 
to accept a consensus of the Twelve on Dehaene. Gonzalez 
described the current situation as "unpleasant," and said that 
he found the alternative of seeking new candidates, as Major 
proposed, "very complicated." 
  The Spanish prime minister would not enter into assessments 
as to whether the British prime minister's stance was due to 
reasons of domestic politics in the United Kingdom -- not 
reasons of a European nature, but he did make it clear that 
"yesterday evening I understood that the possibility of a veto 
was ruled out, and this morning (yesterday), Britain has imposed 
one." 
  Gonzalez said that he could not see the reasons why Major 
was 
prepared to accept Lubbers but not Dehaene, since they are both 
Christian Democrats and there are no qualitative differences 
between their ideas of what Europe should be like. He even 
pointed out in this connection that Lubbers was the architect of 
the Maastricht treaty, so much criticized by London in some of 
its chapters. 
<H5>  Rule of Consensus </H5>
  Asked whether there was not a certain weariness in the 
European Council because it is Britain that periodically blocks 
important decisions in the European building process, Gonzalez 
said: "If there is no consensus, there may be greater or lesser 
irritation among the countries, but we must all accept the 
rules. The rules require consensus, but the countries that do 
not accept this should make an effort at rapprochement, which I 
admit is not obligatory." 
  Gonzalez did not rule out the deadlock's continuing, and 
conjectured that either a solution will be reached in 20 days at 
the special summit that the German presidency will foreseeably 
call, or there will be no choice but to seek alternative 
candidates. With respect to the criticisms leveled against 
Paris and Bonn of lack of openness in proposing Dehaene as a 
candidate, Gonzalez recalled that he was the prime minister who 
supported a candidate and maintained his support for Lubbers to 
the end. "It could be said that we supported a candidate who 
did not win, but it must also be emphasized that we have 
maintained our independence of judgment, and that that possible 
lack of openness did not influence our vote," he said. 
  Asked for an assessment of Berlusconi, Gonzalez was very 
cautious. "I already knew him, and perhaps because of that he 
has felt closer to me. As you know, it is complicated to enter 
into the ways meetings like this work," he concluded. 
<H5>  Felipe Reiterates That He Will Not Be Candidate for </H5>
Commission Presidency 
  Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez recalled during the news 
conference that he has been repeating over the past two years 
that he would not be a candidate for the EC presidency when 
Jacques Delors leaves the post. With the crisis over this 
European politician's succession open in the European Union 
right now, some observers believe that Gonzalez could be a 
candidate accepted by all the Union's member countries. 
  "In a situation of some economic and political difficulty 
such as our country is experiencing, I reaffirm even more my 
decision to fulfill my obligations as prime minister and not to 
be a candidate," Gonzalez flatly asserted. He then added that 
"what has worried me most about the deadlock situation from the 
personal viewpoint is that it could reopen in an alternative 
direction and reach me. I hope that this will be understood, 
especially by those who must understand it -- the Spanish 
public." 
  The Spanish prime minister concluded his thoughts on this 
issue by stating that "some people tell me that the European 
Commission presidency would be a brilliant solution for the next 
five years, but I believe that my prime duty is to try to 
resolve our country's problems and contribute to European 
building from that position -- not from another."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "PSOE Retorts That People's Party </F>
Believes That `Democracy Is Lottery'"] 
  [Text] After learning of [People's Party (PP) Chairman] 
Aznar's statements demanding an early election, PSOE [Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party] and CiU [Convergence and Union] leaders 
stated yesterday that the two political parties are opposed 
because they deem more important the government's stability in 
order to combat the crisis. The PNV [Basque Nationalist Party] 
was also opposed, while ERC [Republican Left of Catalonia] 
reiterated its demand for Gonzalez' resignation. 
  Juan Pedro Hernandez Molto, PSOE of Castilla-La Mancha 
secretary general and a prominent renewalist leader, said in the 
Congress of Deputies that Aznar's remarks are unfortunate 
statements for the country's general interests. 
  "You cannot present a version of democracy," he added, "as 
if 
it were a lottery in which you gamble until you strike it lucky. 
The public knew that they were voting in elections to the 
European Parliament, and that was their intention and the 
interpretation that must be made." 
<H5>  Conditional Support </H5>
  Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) Steering Committee 
Chairman Jose Antoni Duran Lleida stated that "we believe that 
the country needs not bringing the election forward but taking 
important decisions, for which we want a strong government." 
  He added that as long as the government is able to 
"guarantee 
stability" and ensures the strengthening of the economic policy 
that is good for the country, UDC is opposed to bringing the 
election forward because "it means leaving the country open and 
without a government for six or seven months." 
  Nevertheless, he warned that if the Socialists do not 
guarantee the necessary stability "or their own internal 
division renders unfeasible the continuation of the economic 
policy, governability would be cut short by the Socialist 
government, and our support would not make sense." 
  For his part, CiU deputy Jordi Casas said that beginning an 
electoral period right now would mean several months with a 
government with little ability to act, and what is needed "is 
the contrary, in order to try to take advantage of the signs of 
economic recovery." 
  He added that what could prove positive is a process of 
bringing closer together all the political forces' stances in 
order to improve the economic situation and create jobs. 
  PNV spokesman in the Congress Inaki Anasagasti was opposed 
to 
calling an early election on the ground that it would "set back" 
the autonomous community elections that should be held in the 
Basque Country in the fall. 
  Anasagasti stated that the possibility of bringing forward 
the election should be considered only if the government "did 
not have sufficient parliamentary support or did not have its 
own party's support." 
  The Basque nationalist leader said that he "understands" the 
strategy adopted by the People's Party following the European 
elections, "because it should take advantage of the impetus 
achieved with the magnificent 12 June results," although he 
asserted that the elections to the European Parliament cannot be 
turned into a general election. 
  Last, ERC deputy Pilar Rabola agreed with the PP chairman in 
asking Felipe Gonzalez to bring forward the election. 
  However, Rabola specified that, "unlike Aznar, we are 
demanding that it be brought forward not in order to govern but 
because Felipe Gonzalez has lost his political credibility amid 
so many corruption scandals."

<F P=106> [Report by Carmen del Riego: "Roca Criticizes as Dangerous </F>
Falsehood the Assertion That There Are Secret Agreements"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Miquel Roca, CiU [Convergence and Union] 
spokesman in the Congress [of Deputies], yesterday rejected the 
accusation by the People's Party and United Left concerning the 
existence of secret and unacknowledged agreements between Felipe 
Gonzalez and Jordi Pujol, and emphasized the "public 
formulation" of the agreements between CiU and the government, 
since they have all manifested themselves in debates and votes 
in parliament. "No agreement resulting from our talks with the 
government has been unknown to the house," he said, "and they 
have been absolutely open and public in the past and will be so 
in future. To say the contrary is politically legitimate from 
the sectarian or partisan viewpoint, but is a dangerous 
falsehood, because it arouses old passions and apprehensions and 
is dangerous for coexistence in our country." With this 
assertion, Roca justified his group's opposition to Gonzalez' 
appearing in order to explain the meeting with Pujol: 
"Political talks are not subject to parliamentary oversight," 
he said. 
  The CiU spokesman also expressed his conviction that in the 
demand for Gonzalez' appearance "there was no desire for 
clarity, because they have it, since there is nothing opaque or 
confused. Whether it is so clear that it annoys them to know 
that we do not share their strategy is another matter." 
  Miquel Roca also made it clear that at the meeting between 
Gonzalez and Pujol, "the agreement is that two people said what 
is well known: That we are not in favor of bringing forward the 
election, which would be frivolous from the viewpoint of the 
general interest and the Spanish economy; the agreement that the 
economic policy must be intensified and that progress must be 
made in the implementation of autonomy, which is a little-worked 
field. That is, it was examined how progress is to be made on 
the coinciding aims and how it can be guaranteed that they 
coincide, so that stability will be maintained." 
  In the CiU spokesman's opinion, the only thing is that in 
Spain there is "apart from the government's strategy, a strategy 
of dissolving the Cortes, which is the People's Party strategy; 
another of replacing the prime minister, which is United Left's 
strategy; and ours, which is to cause the country to do well, 
and we espouse it. Nobody will be able to show us a single 
instance of our doing what we do in accordance with partisan or 
territorially limited interests." And he stressed that the 
agreements reached on autonomy policy "have been extended to all 
the autonomous communities, and the benefit reaches them all." 
  The next aim in cooperation with the government is the 
budgets for 1995, "because we are not going to support just any 
budget." He emphasized that when the 1994 budget came about, 
"the economic scope for maneuver was very narrow." It is a 
scope that "is fortunately widening now," since the economic 
outlook for 1995 is different, with an increase in GDP, and a 
June that will be good, with an increase in Social Security 
contributors and reduction of unemployment, and this, in his 
opinion, "enables us to be bolder" and tackle "more 
courageously" some reforms that could not be tackled earlier, 
such as company tax. However, Roca left open the possibility of 
dialogue with the People's Party, because "we are not by 
definition far from reaching agreements with those who wish to 
agree." 
  Roca also denied that an agreement or pact between the PSOE 
[Spanish Socialist Workers Party] and United Left in Andalusia 
could have repercussions on CiU's support for the government. 
"We have no objection to United Left's playing a stabilizing 
role in Andalusia. On the contrary, we want a stable government 
that will ensure the greatest possible well-being for the 
Andalusians and the surmounting of their problems. However, if 
the terms set have an impact on Spain's overall economic policy 
aims, that would be a problem."

  "There will be no problems between the two countries," 
Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said when asked by 
journalists whether Karimov had expressed his "concern" over the 
presence and activities of an Uzbek opposition leader in Turkey. 
"Good ties between Turkey and Uzbekistan are very important for 
the region," Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said following a 
luncheon she had with Karimov and Turkish businessmen. Karimov 
asked Turkish businessmen to "invest more" in Uzbekistan. 
Rising to this request, Turkish business tycoon Sakip Sabanci 
declared that he would send a delegation to that country in the 
coming days. 
  However, Turkish sources said that Karimov had raised the 
issue of his country's discomfort at the activities of 
opposition leader Muhammed Salih and was told by the Turkish 
government "not to worry as Turkey would not allow anti-Uzbek 
activities from its territory." 
  Uzbek Communications Minister Kamilzhan Rahimov has 
suggested 
that Uzbekistan could use Turkey's satellite, Turksat, after it 
is launched. 
  President Suleyman Demirel is expected to visit Tashkent in 
October.

  [Text] Istanbul, June 28 (A.A) -- President Suleyman 
Demirel on Tuesday [28 June] said that if the West sees 
democracy in Turkey as allowing the country to split apart, 
Turkey will not be a part of it, adding terror in Turkey aims at 
dividing and attacking its unity. 
  Speaking at a conference at the military academy, he said 
that Turkey has a free press, elections and judgment. 
  He said there are people from different origins in Turkey 
who 
live together in peace, adding the Turkish people of Kurdish 
origin have been living here in peace for the last 1000 years. 
  "All have equal rights and all are first class citizen," he 
said. 
  Demirel also said that the southeastern region is part of 
Turkey and the indivisible unity of Turkey will always be 
protected by its people, organizations, and its armed forces. 
  He said that Turkey is facing problems but they will be 
overcome in time, adding the population increase must be taken 
down to 1 percent from the present 3 by the beginning of the 
next centruy and the agricultural population percentage must be 
lowered from its present 45 percent to 10 percent.

  [Text] Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand 
National Assembly [TGNA], has said that he is not contradicting 
the judiciary in connection with the Democracy Party [DEP] 
deputies, but merely following the Constitution. Cindoruk was 
replying to questions from reporters at Amsterdam airport, where 
he stopped off on his way to The Hague to attend the European 
parliamentary speakers conference. 
  The TGNA speaker pointed out that Turkey has legal ways to 
strip people of their parliamentary memberships. If there is a 
contradiction, he said, it can be set right through an appeal 
and judgment. Cindoruk stressed that the TGNA respects and is 
loyal to the Constitution and the law. 
  Replying to a question on attempts by the deputies who are 
abroad to gain the status of exiles, the TGNA speaker said that 
Turkish law and justice must be trusted. We want all our 
citizens to be in Turkey, he said, and we want these deputies to 
come to Turkey to pursue their rights. Cindoruk pointed out 
that one cannot sit abroad and demand that an injustice -- if 
one exists -- be righted. He said: If they are right, why 
should they live abroad with crimes attributed to them? 
Cindoruk stressed that Turkey has the mechanisms of parliament 
and public opinion to prevent the passage of unjust decisions. 
  Replying to a question on relations between the DEP and the 
PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terror organization, Cindoruk 
said that while trying to crush an antidemocratic gang of 
bandits, Turkey exercises its sovereign rights within the 
framework of democratic rules. He stressed that nobody can 
defend a gang that kills innocent people or those who support 
that gang.

  [Text] Ankara -- The first general congress of the People's 
Democracy Party (HADEP) was held at the Ataturk Sports Hall on 
Friday [24 June]. HADEP was founded to take the place of the 
Democracy Party (DEP) which was closed down by the 
Constitutional Court. 
  So far, no one has come forward as a candidate for 
chairmanship of HADEP, although acting chairman Murat Bozlak is 
expected to announce his candidacy for the post. DEP Chairman 
Hatip Dicle, who is currently in prison, has rejected calls to 
run as a candidate for the HADEP chairmanship. "Our friends 
outside will be of more help," he said. 
  Several DEP members, who joined HADEP after DEP's closure, 
stated that they wished to continue their political struggle 
within the new party. Seventeen of DEP's administrators joined 
HADEP before the congress. 
  They include the party's deputy chairmen Osman Ozcelik, 
Bahattin Gunel and Kemal Bilget and the administrators Ismail 
Arslan, Seyhmuz Cagro, Nevzat Ozbay, Ahmet Cihan, Harun Cakmak, 
Melik Aygul, Muharrem Keklik, Ahmet Karatas, Mehmet Nuri Gundes, 
Mehmet Zeynettin Unay, Mahmut Kovan, Aynur Gurbuz, Veysi Aydin 
and Ali Beykoylu.

<F P=106> [Article by Ismet G. Imset from the "Being (Too) Vocal" </F>
column: "The DEP Closure Case: Which League Are We In?"] 
  [Text] There is no doubt that last week's Constitutional 
Court decision to close down Turkey's one-and-only Kurdish based 
legal party, Democracy Party (DEP), is both constitutional and 
legal. The decision was taken after the court concluded that 
two speeches made by the party's former chairman and a statement 
issued last year by DEP executives were in violation of the 
Constitution and the Political Parties Law. 
  The verdict is, only because of these, both constitutional 
and legal. 
  It is also a verdict which further shows, leaving no room 
for 
doubt, that the crime of opinion exists in Turkey and that there 
is little freedom of conscience or expression in this 
NATO-member country. 
  Opening the United States Institute of Peace conference 
which 
was held in Washington for two days, starting on June 1, one of 
the American speakers had called on the audience to listen to 
what was being said about Turkey only after forgetting that it 
was a NATO member and an American ally. 
  "Evaluate what you hear as you would evaluate developments 
in 
a Muslim country which is neither an American ally nor a member 
of NATO," he had said. 
  The complex relationship between countries of the world, the 
greater business and defense interests as well as future plans 
of influence would indeed make this very difficult. But if for 
a second one could forget Turkey's claims of being a democratic 
country and its business-defense related interests, the picture 
that comes out could be frightening. 
  For one, the DEP ordeal shows how backward the current 
Turkish laws and Constitution are. The Constitution under which 
Turkey is being administered is a constitution which was 
prepared under a military transition period, only two years 
after the 1980 military coup. It is a constitution which was 
forced on the people with the threat that if they did not vote 
in favour for it, they would be losing a major chance. It is a 
constitution which gives lifetime immunity for coup leaders and 
executives and which for years banned the Turks from electing 
their own politicians. 
  It is a military constitution and one which hardly fits in 
with the democratic standards this country has agreed to meet 
under international accords and the Helsinki Final Act. And, as 
the recent verdict has shown, both Turkey's Political Parties 
Law and the Turkish Penal Code are based on the assumption that 
"crimes of opinion" exist and bring about the harshest 
punishment for such crimes. 
  In other words, the recent development has shown that 
Turkish 
democracy is substandard and that civil rights in this country 
are subject to the harshest repression one could imagine. This 
is one. 
  Secondly, through the decision which has banned the DEP and 
the prosecution of all DEP deputies, Ankara has unwillingly 
served the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] argument that Turkey 
"has closed its doors on any legal struggle and has no 
tolerance." 
  Having banned the DEP, Turkey has shown to the world that 
indeed it has no tolerance even to legal movements on the 
Kurdish platform. That under current laws and the Constitution, 
to imagine a legal movement for the Kurds or a political 
struggle on their behalf is only a dream. 
  The doors to a legal Kurdish struggle in Turkey have been 
closed down and it is certain that the PKK will benefit the most 
out of this. Not only will it use this opportunity to expand 
its influence in foreign countries and propagate, but it will 
also effort [as published] to use this "substantial evidence" in 
legitimizing its own status as an illegal movement. With 
decisions like this, what more could the PKK have wanted? Who 
now, in the West, is in a position to insist that illegality can 
not be approved and that the PKK does not have a valid reason to 
exist? 
  How can we further this argument any longer with six elected 
members of Parliament in jail, two others under constant 
surveillance and six more in exile in Europe, facing now charges 
of "terrorism?" 
  Indeed, the PKK has been served in such a great way over the 
past months and especially last week that it is difficult to 
believe those persecuting Kurdish activists are actually enemies 
of those activists. 
  But this is not all. 
  Husamettin Cindoruk, in a highly interesting statement to 
the 
daily HURRIYET, said on Sunday that wherever he travels abroad, 
he is challenged to explain statements made by State Security 
Court prosecutor Nusret Demiral. 
  When it comes to letters, he says, he can answer them. 
"But," 
adds the Parliament speaker, "it is difficult to say things face 
to face." 
  Turkey has many laws inhibiting the freedom of expression 
and 
perhaps the strongest of these are related to remarks or action 
made abroad which could discredit Turkey or Turkish security 
forces. Any statement to be made abroad, for instance, could be 
punished with severe prison terms if the "suspect" is found 
"guilty" of speaking against the country's best interests or if 
he or she says something that could discredit the country. 
Looking back into the past, one could easily recall an Istanbul 
military tribunal prosecutor who persecuted anyone with a 
controversial opinion over a period of many years. Wherever one 
looks, his signature is still there. He was the mastermind of 
the peace association persecution and threw hundreds of people 
behind the bars. 
  It was soon understood that his relations extended beyond 
the 
limits of the court rooms, into the dark corridors of the 
"Mafia." It was also understood and put on the record that 
whenever Turkey's relations with Western countries started to 
improve, he would open a new case casting further shadows on 
Turkey's human rights record. 
  It's almost as if he was actually trying to discredit Turkey 
or spoil relations with the West. 
  According to the law, we are not at liberty to judge current 
prosecutors and their motives--and in reality they are too 
powerful in all ways of life to challenge them. Furthermore, 
there is always the constant threat. The threat that HE gets 
frighteningly upset when criticized, that HE should be treated 
with care and that HE never forgets. I was told last week not 
to anger HIM, on the grounds that HE would not forgive. 
Changing the subject, the fact is that the State Security 
Courts have been established to prevent crimes against the 
state. In the words of President Suleyman Demirel, the aim of 
creating these courts was to take swift action against criminals 
who had targeted the state. 
  "The normal courts were in a bottleneck," he explained in a 
recent interview. "Criminals were just walking out," Then one 
can assume that the DGMs [State Security Courts] are not 
"normal" courts and that they have been created to prevent 
"criminals from walking out." In other words, although 
officials argue that the DGMs are as impartial as other courts, 
they also confess that they have a special duty. "To keep the 
criminals in." 
  And, since the crime of opinion exists in Turkey and the 
people themselves have little tolerance to others with different 
opinions, such courts have been extremely successful in keeping 
opinion criminals inside. 
  Such crimes, technically, can be committed in only two forms 
and at that, Turkey has something to be proud of. For instance, 
one cannot be charged or imprisoned for only "thinking" of 
something without expressing it. Thus the crime can be 
committed in the verbal and written form. 
  Putting such opinions into writing can be a crime. Voicing 
such opinions can also be a crime. Mehdi Zana, a former mayor 
for Diyarbakir, is in jail for speaking at the European 
Parliament in 1992. Two Turkish MPs of Kurdish origin face 
possible capital punishment for speaking before the Helsinki 
Commission and so on. 
  Demiral himself explained last week in another HURRIYET 
interview when asked whether he read books, that they mostly 
read obscene books. According to him, the DGM prosecutors read 
the books word by word "to see whether the opinions behind those 
words" constituted a crime. That is when the charges are 
brought up. Charges at a State Security Court, established 
mainly to prevent crimes against the state. 
  The authority of DGMs is indeed too vast and widespread. It 
can be exploited in every way depending on the individuals in 
charge of the prosecution. 
  Meanwhile, speaking of independent justice, one needs to 
note that at least one of Ankara DGK's chief prosecutors is a 
military officer--with all personnel records attached to the 
Chief of Staff. And there are politics. Demiral, for instance, 
makes it no secret that he personally believes the Turkish race 
comes from the Grey Wolves--a symbol used by the extreme 
rightists and so on. 
  Politically speaking, one has also to ask how the 
Constitutional Court took last Thursday's decision and under 
which circumstances. 
  Why, for instance, did everyone in the TDN [TURKISH DAILY 
NEWS] already know hours in advance on Thursday morning that the 
decision "for closure" would be passed that day and that the 
court was under pressure to do so as soon as possible. How did 
we know this? How come the information which reached us seems 
to be true? How impartial is such a decision which carefully 
maintains the parliamentary status of four deputies, thus 
closing the doors for a by-election? The coincidences are too 
great. 
  It is not very long since Parliament acted in a similar 
haste 
and although it had the files for one and-a-half years, lifted 
the immunity of eight deputies in a matter of hours. It is 
worth remembering that the action was taken only after Gen. 
Dogan Gures pointed the finger at Parliament and said "why 
should we look for the bandits on the mountains while they are 
in Parliament." 
  Never before, aside from military coup regimes has the 
credibility and respectability of the Turkish Parliament been 
eroded so much by state officials. 
  Think of a country where an army general can publicly go on 
the record accusing an elected parliament of banditry, where a 
police chief can order a besiege of this almost-holy compound 
and where a prosecutor can call members of parliament, who still 
maintain their MP status, as "terrorists" and ban their exit 
from Turkey. 
  Moreover, think of this country where security forces have 
evacuated and burned down over 900 villages, where at least 50 
journalists are in prison, where writers, publishers and newsmen 
are arrested almost every week, where economists and 
academicians are placed behind bars only for expressing their 
views and where death- squads roam the streets to abduct, 
torture and kill Kurdish origin businessmen and activists. 
  The "nation's assembly" is the Turkish expression we use to 
describe our parliament. An assembly where the people send 
their elected representatives to speak on their behalf. An 
assembly in which when we hear things we don't want said, we 
move against those people these days. 
  It appears that through some people's actions Turkey's 
credibility abroad is at stake and their movements are a black 
mark against the whole nation. Meanwhile, Parliament itself is 
losing its remaining influence. 
  Recent remarks made by some very high level state officials 
imply that they have lost all faith in parliamentary democracy 
themselves. That they neither respect nor give any value to 
Parliament. 
  More important though, is that the behaviour of some of 
these 
officials is hurting Turkey abroad, overshadowing its 
credibility and helping the terrorists. Under normal 
circumstances, these could be regarded as serious crimes as well. 
  For years, I have argued that Turkey's policy in the 
Southeast has helped recruitment for the terrorists and that the 
PKK's strength is owed mainly to policy mistakes more than 
anything else. For years I have argued with DEP politicians and 
those on the "legal platform" that their withdrawal from 
politics would hurt Turkey, that the only legal alternative to 
the PKK should be given the chance to survive and that this 
historical opportunity should not be wasted. Now, there is no 
need to argue anymore. 
  These days, it appears that a new step is being taken. One 
which is not only incredibly serving to give legitimacy to 
illegality but one which, in a crucial post-August era where 
Turkey's overall fate is attached, will further boost the crisis 
Turkey faces. 
  Looking at the recent developments, the only hope one can 
have is for two separate political efforts continuing outside of 
the DEP to gain momentum--and at least be tolerated. 
  Currently, former minister Serafettin Elci is trying to 
establish a conservative party. Another Kurdish 
activist-turned- poet, Kemal Burkay, is also trying to set up an 
independent political party. 
  The DEP closure may have given way to further arguments on 
Turkish democracy but whatever has happened, this does not mean 
all doors are closed. 
  Everyone is aware of how provocative the DEP has been and 
how 
much it has fanned Turkish anger against the Kurdish movement in 
general. Even Sedat Yurttas spoke of these "mistakes" over the 
weekend. 
  Now, however, there is a chance for those people without 
"mistakes" to make an appearance on the political scene and this 
has to be regarded as a last-minute-chance for Turkey as much as 
the activists in this field. 
  What fate these new--and extremely moderate--activists will 
have is another issue and one which appears to closely depend on 
international reaction to the DEP case. If those ruling Turkey 
behind the scenes are given the correct messages, this could at 
least create the beginning of an atmosphere of tolerance. The 
hard liners for some time have argued that the DEP brought 
trouble on itself and that it was the preference of a majority 
of Turks to "punish" the party which had not only failed to 
condemn PKK terrorism but gave the impression that it actually 
supported it. 
  The same argument cannot have any grounds where Elci and 
Burkay are concerned. To be more clear, there could be a chance 
for a fresh start despite all of the pain which has been 
witnessed and despite the PKK's own threats to any movements it 
cannot control. 
  The question is whether Turkey can be made to tolerate this 
fresh start for its own benefit, at the cost of amending its 
constitution and laws. 
  It appears to me that such a chance exists and that Turkey's 
allies will be playing a vital role on what happens in the 
future. 
  No one should be expected to accept a country, claiming to 
be 
democratic, continuing to judge and punish opinion. As no one 
should expect human rights violations of any sort, committed by 
either side of the conflict, to be forgotten. 
  Only this way can Turkey truly argue against what will be 
portrayed as the legitimacy of illegality. 
  Thus, action must be taken immediately. Action must be taken 
to insure the safety of new politicians who will appear on the 
scene of legal activities--both against the PKK and their 
persecutors. Action also has to be taken to voice concern on the 
freedom of expression in Turkey. 
  There appears to be no ground whatsoever to the argument 
that 
this issue is only Turkey's domestic in-house affair. 
  For, through the efforts of certain individuals who 
currently 
exploit power in the absence of a strong civilian regime, the 
affair has been turned into an international one with very 
serious humanitarian interests. 
  Also, unfortunately for those behind the intolerant campaign 
we now witness, Turkey has signed international accords and is 
obliged to meet certain international criteria. 
  If we cannot meet these terms regulated mainly by the 
International Declaration of Human Rights, Paris Charter and the 
Helsinki Final Act, and if we continue to insist on punishing 
the "crime of expression," at least we should show the decency 
to withdraw our signature from such accords and make the world 
know openly where we stand and which democratic league we are in. 
  Then, at least, we can freely fight it out among ourselves.

  [Text] Diyarbakir, June 28 (AA) -- The trial of the illegal 
Hezbollah organization, which has been connected to the upsurge 
unsolved murders in Diyarbakir and Batman, began here today. 
  The trial of 35 defendants began with the reading of the 
prosecutor's indictment. 
  The indictments gave detailed accounts on the organization's 
charter, foundation, objectives, revenues and actions. 
  The indictment said that the Hezbollah was established 
against PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] and other Marxist 
Leninist organizations in east and southeast Anatolia and aimed 
at establishing a Kurdish state based on the Iranian-type 
Islamic model. 
  Hezbollah, which means Party of God, describes any country 
not administered by the shari'ah, the legal code of Islam, as an 
enemy, it said. 
  The revenues of the Hezbollah were obtained by legal and 
illegal Islamic organizations abroad, books published legally or 
illegally in Turkey and abroad and Koranic courses as well as 
student hostels. 
  The indictment added that the 35 defendants are accused of 
being involved in 39 separate actions in Diyarbakir and Batman, 
killing 25 people and wounding 32. 
  The indictment demanded the death sentence for 15 
defendants, 
15-year prison terms for 15 other defendants and a five-year 
prison term for one defendant.

<F P=106> [Report by Murat Demirel and Emin Demirel: "Identity of an </F>
IMO Terrorist Established"] 
  [Text] Istanbul--Teams of the antiterror department have 
established that Irfan Cagrici was the person who killed Cetin 
Emec and Turan Dursun. Cagrici, who heads the Islamic Movement 
Organization [IMO] in Istanbul, was the hit man in the two 
incidents. The teams also established that he has been known by 
his alias "Mesut" and has used forged identification 
certificates in the names of Mustafa Kayacan and Hasan Aksoy. 
  The teams arrested Irfan Cagrici's brother, Ridvan Cagrici, 
in Istanbul some time ago. He provided information to the IMO. 
The directorates of police in the provinces and the immigration 
officials in the border gates, airports, and seaports have been 
instructed to arrest Irfan Cagrici. 
  The police carried out an operation against the IMO 
militants 
in Izmir after they kidnapped an Italian child for ransom some 
time ago. Acting in the light of the revelations made by the 
arrested militants, the police shifted their operations against 
the organization to Istanbul. They established that the forged 
identification certificates the militants carried were prepared 
in an IMO cell-house in Yenibosna. The police units stormed the 
house and arrested Ridvan Cagrici. He revealed during his 
interrogation that he was among the founders of the IMO. He was 
placed in custody for being involved in 1984 robberies aimed at 
providing funds for the organization. Ridvan Cagrici was 
released from prison in 1992. He revealed that his elder 
brother, Irfan Cagrici, is the leading member of the 
organization in Istanbul. He also brought to light a point that 
has remained in the dark until now. He disclosed that Irfan 
Cagrici was the IMO hit man who has killed several people, 
including journalist Cetin Emec. 
  The officials have established that Irfan Cagrici, alias 
"Mesut," is the leading IMO member in Istanbul. He is 
responsible for the activities of the IMO "operations teams" and 
has helped the IMO terrorists to train in Iran. Irfan Cagrici 
has used forged identification certificates drawn up in the 
names of Mustafa Kayacan and Hasan Aksoy.

<F P=106> [Report by Adnan Gerger: "The Set-3 Operation in Ankara"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Ankara--Security units have impounded 14 
Kalashnikov rifles and 18 other firearms in an operation in 
Ankara. The officials have ascertained that the arms were 
secretly brought into Turkey from Iraq. Acting on information, 
the police organization has taken wide-scale measures against 
possible terrorist activities in Ankara and Istanbul. The 
police units in the two cities have been placed on a state of 
alert. 
  Officials of the police department on smuggling and illegal 
arms in Ankara received information that preparations were made 
to smuggle arms into Turkey some time ago. They investigated 
the matter and established that the attempt to smuggle arms into 
Turkey had international connections. The police organization 
then launched a secret operation, which was code named as 
"Set-3." [passage omitted] 
  The case was relentlessly pursued by officials for 10 days. 
It ended in the Yenimahalle quarter of Ankara. Two persons 
arrived in Ankara yesterday in a car loaded with arms. They 
drove to the Yenimahalle quarter of the city. However, 
something went wrong with their appointment and they tried to 
drive away. That was when the "Set-3" officials arrested them. 
The police discovered 14 Kalashnikov rifles and 18 automatic 
handguns, most of which were 9 mm, in secret compartments of 
their car. 
  The scope of the operation broadened and the police in 
Ankara 
were alerted after the impounding of the Kalashnikov rifles and 
handguns. The teams of the General Directorate of Police 
Smuggling and Intelligence Department, Antiterrorist Department, 
and Intelligence Department participated in the operations. The 
two suspects, whose names have not been disclosed, refrained 
from giving detailed information on their activities during 
their first interrogation. However, the officials have 
established that the sale of the arms took place in Saudi 
Arabia. They were then smuggled into Turkey from Iraq. 
  The police officials are trying to establish whether or not 
the two suspects are linked with the Workers Party of Kurdistan 
or the IBDA-C [Islamic Great Eastern Raiders Front]. Meanwhile, 
considering the possibility that the arms have been smuggled 
into Turkey for terrorist activities either in Ankara or 
Istanbul, they have launched operations against many suspected 
cell houses.

<F P=106> [Report by Nuri Kayis: "Automobile Factories Will </F>
Manufacture Arms"] 
  [Text] Ankara--The industrial establishments in the private 
sector, which are in a difficult situation as a result of the 
economic crisis in Turkey, will manufacture arms, ammunition, 
military vehicles, equipment, and spare parts for the Turkish 
Armed Forces. That will enable them to alleviate the effects of 
the economic crisis. Meanwhile, the effects of a possible 
embargo on Turkey will be nullified. The National Assembly 
Committee on Industry and Technology has quickly approved the 
draft law that will enable the private sector establishments to 
meet the needs of the military forces. 
  According to the draft law, the Ministry of National 
Defense, 
the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and the General Staff will 
determine the establishments that can manufacture arms with 
minor changes in their structure. Protocols will be signed with 
them later, and the government will provide them with financial 
resources. The draft law has been drawn up by the Ministry of 
National Defense and approved by the Council of Ministers. 
Several industrial sectors, including the establishments that 
manufacture vehicles, household effects, and electronic 
equipment, will be geared to manufacture every kind of equipment 
the military forces require when the National Assembly enacts 
the draft law. 
<H5>  Golhan's Statement </H5>
  Minister of National Defense Mehmet Golhan has said: "The 
country must be in a position to meet all its needs from its 
national resources in order to render any embargo by foreign 
countries at critical times ineffective." Meanwhile, Azimet 
Koyluoglu, chairman of the National Assembly Committee on 
Industry and Technology, said the following: "The new 
arrangement was required to support the establishments in the 
private sector and contribute toward the country's defense. The 
automobile factories in Bosnia have been converted into 
arms-producing establishments because of the war in that 
country. They have shouldered a significant responsibility in 
the effort the Muslim people are making to defend their 
homeland. We live in peace. However, we have to plan what we 
may have to do in case of war." 
  The section, which outlined the reasons for the draft law, 
said in part the following: "Turkey acquires its arms, military 
equipment, and spare parts from foreign sources. However, it 
may not be able to acquire its needs from the same sources in 
the event of a mobilization or war. Therefore, the possibility 
of having the arms and equipment Turkey requires manufactured in 
the country should be studied. Meeting the needs of the 
military forces from Turkey's industrial establishments will 
reactivate the national industry sector and create an 
opportunity for the country to save foreign currency."

<F P=106> [Article by Hasan Cemal: "What Might Happen If the U.S. Aid </F>
Package Is Rejected or Accepted?"] 
  [Text] Ankara -- We met many of our high-ranking diplomats 
during [journalist] Fatih Cekirge's cocktail party in the SABAH 
office in Ankara on Tuesday evening [21 June]. We held talks 
with Minister of Foreign Affairs Hikmet Cetin and Under 
Secretary of the Foreign Ministry Ozdem Sanberk. One of the 
issues we discussed was the relationship between Turkey and the 
United States. In other words, we exchanged views on the new 
kind of relations emerging between the two countries since the 
cold war era ended. The matter came up when we were exchanging 
views on whether or not the U.S. aid package for Turkey should 
be rejected. That is currently an important issue on the 
diplomatic back burner. A number of diplomats argue that it 
should be immediately rejected.... Several others are inclined 
to take a more professional approach on the matter. They 
maintain that an effort should be made to find an approach more 
effective than ostentatious and daring initiatives. Meanwhile, 
several diplomats have described Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's 
statement that her government may reject the conditional U.S. 
aid as an example of diplomatic blunder. 
  As far as the U.S. aid package is concerned, the general 
view 
is that it should not be accepted if conditions are linked with 
it.... However, the diplomatic struggle must be maintained 
against this bias in the U.S. Congress.... Foreign Minister 
Hikmet Cetin shares that view. 
  What can be done? It will be useful to discuss several 
points before that question is considered. We still have the 
old habbit of referring to what we receive from the United 
States as U.S. aid. However, what we actually receive from that 
country is not aid but credits in accordance with the existing 
market conditions.... The U.S. Congress is gradually reducing 
the U.S. aid package to foreign countries because the Soviet 
Union has collapsed and the cold war has ended. The U.S. 
military aid is expected to end in a few years.... That is why 
the Turkish officials think like this: The aid is going to end. 
Let us be the side which is more daring. The material aspect 
of the matter is not important. Therefore, the aid package 
should be rejected right now, at this moment. 
  Another reason put forward by those who support that view is 
as follows: The anti-Turkish lobby in the United States--that 
is, the Greek Cypriot, Greek, and Armenian lobbies--have 
exploited the question of U.S. aid to Turkey for many years. 
(The Serbs have now moved to support those lobbies) They have 
harmed Turkey-U.S. relations by imposing conditions because of 
the Cyprus problem and other issues. The rejection of the aid 
will deprive them of their opportunity to harm Turkey. 
<H5>  The Human Rights Lobby </H5>
  The general view among the Turkish Foreign Ministry 
officials 
is that the U.S. aid package cannot be accepted in its present 
form, that is, with the conditions that have been linked to it 
in connection with the Cyprus problem, human rights issues, and 
the Kurdish problem. However, it is a fact that the rejection 
of the aid package will not resolve the problem. Human rights 
has been an important issue in the relations between Turkey and 
the United States for several years. Therefore, even if 
military aid is taken off the agenda, the question of human 
rights will continue to be discussed in the congressional back 
rooms. That point must always be kept in mind. 
  Even if Congress approves the conditional aid package to 
Turkey, President Clinton is not expected to veto it. That 
state of affairs will affect not only Turkey's relations with 
the United States, but also with the European Countries. 
Congress' decision will set an example for the European 
countries on matters related to Cyprus, human rights, and the 
Kurdish problem.... 
  This matter should be considered calmly. The conditional 
aid package should be rejected. However, that will not resolve 
the problem. Looking at the relations between Turkey and the 
United States only from that angle would be wrong. Let us 
consider the matter from a wider perspective. Dangerous trends 
-- such as chauvinism, extreme nationalist-conservative forces, 
and religious trends -- are gradually strengthening in 
Turkey.... Those forces must not be allowed to influence 
Turkey's policy toward the United States and Europe. Turkey has 
decided to join the European club. It is a member of the OECD, 
NATO, the European Council, and CSCE. It is in the customs 
union with the European Union. It is striving to take a place 
among the top countries in the world, not the Third World 
countries. Turning its back on the Western countries and 
allowing its relations with the United States and Europe to 
deteriorate would not be in Turkey's interest. Nor would it be 
in its interest to close its doors to the outside world, concern 
itself only with its own problems, and seek nonexistent horizons 
because of the rhetoric that "the Western countries do not like 
us." 
  It can be said that the same situation applies to the United 
States and Europe from the geostrategic viewpoint. That is 
true. Losing Turkey would not be in the interests of the United 
States and Europe.... That, however, must not be exaggerated.... 
<H5>  To See the Greatness.... </H5>
  What can be done under the existing conditions? It is 
essential for Turkey to put its house in order. It has to 
rectify its economy, improve its adherence to democracy, 
separate the Kurdish problem from its struggle against the 
Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK], and take the necessary steps 
in that regard from the point of view of democracy and human 
rights.... 
  Turkey has no alternative as the new century draws closer. 
Turkey, which has a population of 60 million people, will draw 
closer to the United States and Europe if it improves its 
economy. The United States and Europe will regard Turkey as an 
inalienable partner if it removes its deficiencies in applying 
democratic principles and adhering to human rights.... Turkey 
is a great country. Neither the PKK nor the Kurdish problem 
should be allowed to influence its relations with the Western 
countries. Let us hope that the officials have enough foresight 
to realize its greatness. 
  In short, whether or not U.S. aid is rejected is not 
important. Turkey has to have a broader concept of the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Johan Cuppens: "European Parliament Gets Unique </F>
Opportunity in Discussions About Commission President -- Germany 
Ambiguous About Support for Prime Minister Dehaene"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Unique Chance </H5>
  The pressure to find a European Commission (EC) president 
quickly is in part based on the wish to not create an open 
conflict with the European Parliament (EP), which will gather in 
Strasbourg from 19 July. On Monday [27 June], there were calls 
for the question of Delors's succession to be presented to the 
EP. 
  And why not? The view that the EP is not empowered to do so 
is correct. But no parliament has ever had powers just thrown 
into its lap. Power always has to be won, and this struggle 
never really stops. In the recent European elections, there 
were complaints about the low turnout and the huge gulf between 
the EP and the citizen. That does not have to stay that way. 
Next month, the EP will get a unique chance to prove itself and 
fight for its place in Europe. 
  Well-informed sources do not rule out the possibility that 
the present EC President Jacques Delors will stay on half a year 
longer. Delors, according to these sources, is hesitating about 
presenting himself as a candidate for next year's French 
presidential elections. If he does not do so, then Delors would 
be available to lead the EC for another six months. 
  However, this solution does not address the core of the 
matter: The member states will have to settle things in one way 
or another. Postponement will yield nothing. The stakes are 
high and in the first place do not concern Jean-Luc Dehaene, but 
Europe itself.

<F P=106> [Report signed Th.E.: "Things Are Moving in the Chasm of </F>
the Debt"] 
  [Text] On Monday [20 June], Finance Minister Philippe 
Maystadt presented the report on the public debt development in 
1993, updated to 31 May. 
  On 31 May, the state debt amounted to 9,183.4 billion 
Belgian 
francs [BFr], or 128 percent of 1993's GDP. The debt in Belgian 
francs represents 83.6 percent of the total, in other words 5 
percent less than the previous year. This is due to the rise in 
interest rates at the end of last summer. We borrowed in German 
marks to avoid the high rates and counted on the franc's 
recovery. The short-term debt increased from 30.5 percent to 
33.4 percent of the total. This is the result of very high 
long-term interest rates, a fact which leaves the finance 
minister puzzled. 
  The debt continues to grow at an excessively high rate. 
Instead of the 5.8 percent stipulated, the debt rate reached 
7.2 percent in 1993. "In view of the recession, this is not a 
bad result by comparison," Maystadt commented. "But it is not 
adequate. Even outside of the European constraints, we must 
rapidly return to close to 3 percent in order to reduce the 
stock of debts and regain room to maneuver." 
  The 1994 target is a 5.5-percent deficit. It should be 
possible to achieve around 5.7 percent, the slightly higher 
figure due to social security and the regional authority 
expenditures rather than from the state. "We are ending a 
debate with the communities and regions," Maystadt said, "to 
establish a normal level of growth in spending for each." 
  If spending is controlled at all levels, the prospects for 
improvement are serious because the revenue is coming in: Up 13 
percent for the first five months of 1994, compared with the 
same period in 1993! Maystadt sees several causes for this: 
The increase in taxes, the economic recovery, a speeding up of 
VAT [value-added tax] revenue, and the struggle against fraud. 
"Following the hiring of specialized staff, several big 
companies have paid tens of millions in additional tax. In the 
banking and insurance sector, back tax amounted to 1 billion. 
And they are paying!" 
  The medium and long-term debt is changing face. So-called 
classical loans, negotiated with the banking consortium, are 
giving way to state bonds (which amount to BFr1,000 billion), 
and especially linear bonds (hitherto reserved for banks and 
institutions but which will shortly be offered to the general 
public). At the beginning of 1994, in view of the "calls" 
(early repayments to take advantage of lower interest rates), 
BFr1,618 billion in loans came to term. A record! "More than 
70 percent are already refinanced," Maystadt said with 
satisfaction, "without disrupting the markets, at a lower cost, 
and with an increase in the average duration." 
  In 1993, average interest rates weighted on the debt dropped 
from 8.8 percent to 8.1 percent. The state paid BFr699.4 
billion in interest. Each Belgian therefore paid an average of 
BFr70,000 to the Belgians holding state bonds. Revenue from 
capital is taxed at 13.39 percent, in other words much lower 
than revenue from labor. "One of the priorities of the coming 
German presidency," Maystadt announced, "is to arrive at a more 
equitable taxation of this revenue at a European level." In 
Germany, the tax on capital revenues is 30 percent. An 
agreement on between 15 and 20 percent is plausible if Europe 
can avoid the risk of a mass exodus of capital to other 
countries like Switzerland.

<F P=106> [Article by Kurt Horwitz: "The Dollar Rate as a Weapon in </F>
the Trade War"] 
  [Text] "Comeback for the greenback" -- this is what eminent 
financial publications wrote in their headlines at the beginning 
of the year. They could refer to the unanimous predictions of 
virtually all international financial strategists, and there was 
absolutely no indication that, just like last year, the dollar 
rate might again fall into a deep "summer hole." 
  Rising U.S. interests were making the American currency 
attractive, the economy was flourishing, NAFTA was to provide 
additional stimulus for industry, which was working at capacity 
anyway. Some analysts even saw the dollar rise to the level of 2 
German marks [DM] or 14 schillings after the American currency 
had plummeted to DM1.60 or about 11 schillings in the middle of 
last year. 
  The dollar has now dropped to that level again to the 
surprise of everyone, at least in Europe. Yet, the real reason 
for the weakness of the dollar is probably to be found further 
east. In Tokyo, the U.S. currency stands at just 100 yen, which 
is a historic low. Fifty years after Pearl Harbor, this might 
impair the Americans' self assurance; economically, however, it 
is a blessing for the U.S. economy, which suffered a more than 
$60-billion record deficit last year in trade with Japan. 
  The lower the dollar falls, the more expensive Japanese cars 
become, for example, on the American market. Or vice versa: To 
remain competitive, the Japanese must put up with losses in 
sales -- they get fewer yen for each dollar they gain in the 
United States from their exports. The dollar is almost 10 
percent down from last year's high. 
  This also explains why political experts in the United 
States 
not only acknowledge the decline of the dollar with relative 
indifference but even deliberately produced it. Gail Fosler, 
chief economist of the New York-based "Conference Board" 
business organization, in a predicition that received wide 
international attention, said that the dollar might drop as low 
as DM1.50. His analysis is regarded as one important cause for 
the slump of the dollar. 
  Fosler has, of course, provided good reasons: The German 
economy was recovering, which would lead to rising interests in 
Europe, making the dollar less attractive compared to the German 
mark; prices for oil, metals, and agricultural products might 
force up inflation in the United States in the second half of 
the year and affect the economy. Investors got the message and 
promptly sold dollars. They now prefer to invest in European 
currencies and the yen. 
  Yet, this is only the obviously rational element of the 
dollar spectacle. In reality, "negative remarks to force down 
the U.S. currency" are an important part of the determined 
campaign against the flood of Japanese exports. In the middle 
of February, U.S. President Clinton, who was visibly upset, had 
to recognize in the summit talks with then Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa that his partner in the talks was not ready to 
conclude an efficient trade agreement. 
  For a moment, the Americans considered discriminating 
against 
Japanese products on the American market through a decree. Yet, 
even in the United States, which certainly has very few scruples 
as far as this is concerned, such a step would have been 
regarded as a rather primitive blow against the unwanted 
competitor. 
  Yet, what a coincidence: Since then, prominent U.S. 
economists and political experts have analyzed the dollar 
systematically down. Soon the dollar would be worth no more than 
80 or 90 yen, they predict -- and the Japanese industry already 
sees itself confronted with enormous losses on the U.S. market. 
  This is, of course, a much more elegant way of conducting a 
trade war. Plus, it also explains why the Americans are 
currently only making half-hearted attempts to effectively 
stabilize the course of the dollar. Undesired side effects, 
such as higher prices for certain imports, only play a 
relatively insignificant role in this trade war.

<F P=106> [By Mark Atkinson, PRESS ASSOCIATION economics correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The Treasury today upgraded its forecast for 
economic growth in 1994 to 2.75 percent from the Budget 
prediction last November of 2.5 percent. And, in what amounts 
to a golden scenario for the Government, it said prices would 
rise more slowly than at first thought. 
  The more optimistic outlook for growth is coupled with a big 
downward revision to the expected level of underlying inflation 
-- the Government's preferred measure which excludes mortgage 
interest payments. 
  According to Treasury calculations, it is set to average 2.5 
percent in the last three months of 1994 against 3.25 percent 
previously forecast -- well within the Government's 1 percent to 
4 percent target range. 
  The combination of higher growth and lower than anticipated 
inflation has allowed the Treasury to reduce the amount of money 
it expects to borrow to plug the gap between its spending and 
income. 
  The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement [PSBR] in the 
financial year 1994-95 is now put at 36 billion pounds sterling 
-- 2 billion less than predicted last November. 
  The improved performance of the economy is expected to 
continue next year when growth is again forecast to be 2.75 
percent. 
  However, the Treasury warned that inflation may be pushed up 
temporarily to 2.75 percent by the end of 1995 as the amount of 
slack in the economy is taken up. 
  The PSBR is expected to fall to 28 billion pounds sterling 
in 
1995-96 -- 2 billion lower than previously forecast. 
  Mr Clarke said the figures showed that the Government's 
monetary, fiscal and supply side measures were having their 
effect, "placing this country in an excellent situation with the 
chance, if we are prepared to take it, of having good recovery 
with low inflation, falling unemployment and rising prosperity 
for several years ahead." 
  He said the forecast was "prudent and sensible," adding: 
"This is not a government that is encouraging its forecasters to 
go wild with over optimism." 
  Addressing a news conference at the Treasury, Mr Clarke 
issued a series of health warnings about the figures contained 
in the Government's first summer economic forecast. 
  He said: "The figures in the forecast are objective, the 
best 
we can produce and show a combination of very favourable 
circumstances at the moment. But I don't believe we should look 
at them as if every figure is bound to be accurate and a spot 
forecast of where we will be in 12 months time," he said. "They 
are a guide to policy but I have no intention of being dominated 
by them," the Chancellor added. Mr Clarke stressed that there 
was "quite a margin of error in forecasting of this kind." But 
he said the figures in the forecast were "good news" for the 
British economy. "We have quite the best combination of 
circumstances pointing to sustainable growth and low inflation 
that I can remember for a very long time." 
  Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown told PA [PRESS ASSOCIATION] 
News: ``The Chancellor is being complacent about the short-term 
because millions of people have seen their living standards fall 
and complacent about the long-term because he has done nothing 
to address the fundamental problems of the economy. 
  ``Growth will not reach even 3 percent before 1996, if the 
Chancellor is to be believed. The prospects for long-term and 
high sustainable growth needed for rises in the standard of 
living are simply not there.'' 
  It appeared that Mr Clarke was heading for a fight with Bank 
of England Governor Eddie George over the direction of the 
economy. "It is clear that the Governor of the Bank of England 
now believes that interest rates and therefore mortgages are 
going to have to rise. For that to happen so early in the 
recovery is not good news for the long-term prospects of the 
economy." Mr Brown claimed that the Government had little room 
for manoeuvre by bringing in tax cuts as a sweetener before the 
next election. 
  He added: "There is nothing that this Chancellor can do on 
taxes that is going to impress the electorate. He can't undo 
the damage done by what he himself has had to admit is the 
equivalent, with all the tax rises he was sought, of a 7 percent 
rise in income tax."

<F P=106> [Government statement delivered by Foreign Minister Klaus </F>
Kinkel to the Bundestag in Bonn -- live] 
  [Text] Madame President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  The European Union [EU] Council in Corfu made some 
additional 
progress with European unification, even though it was not 
possible to agree on a new Commission president. The signing of 
the membership treaties with Austria, Finland, Sweden, and 
Norway, and the signing of the partnership and cooperation 
agreement with Russia made one thing clear: The EU has begun to 
successfully tackle the shaping of Europe, shaping a common 
future of the European peoples in an EU that is linked in 
partnership with Russia and which includes the Baltic Sea just 
as it does the Mediterranean. [applause] 
  After the Austrians' impressive yes to Europe, I am 
confident 
that our Nordic neighbors will also vote for this community, 
because never before has it been clearer in Europe that there is 
no future in acting on one's own account. [applause] 
  With this appeal to its partners, the Federal Government, 
which will hold the presidency as of 1 July, will now try to 
achieve a consensus on the succession of Jacques Delors, who has 
indeed gained great merit with his work for Europe. [applause] 
  If necessary, it will convene an extraordinary European 
Council for this matter in Brussels on 15 July. 
  The EU needs a strong European figure at the head of the 
Commission, and this decision must be made quickly. The last 
thing the EU needs at this decisive landmark is a lack of 
decisionmaking power and a lack of the ability to achieve 
consensus. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, in two days reunited Germany will for 
the first time take over the chairmanship in the EU Council. We 
will do everything in our power to make progress in the cause of 
Europe within this limited period of six months -- in closest 
coordination with France, which will follow us in the presidency 
and with which we will subsequently be in the troika, but also 
with the later presidencies of Spain and Italy. 
  I am currently in the process of visiting all 12 European 
countries to prepare for that. We Germans see our future in the 
common European path. This must be our compass. [applause] 
  And we do not want to make any promises that we cannot keep. 
We must dedicate ourselves to solid, consistent management. 
Very specific issues must be tackled, such as the employment 
situation, unemployment, and crime, which are truly burning 
problems for the people in Europe. At the same time, however, 
the issue is also the further shaping of our continent, that is, 
the deepening and enlargement of the nucleus of Europe that the 
EU constitutes today. 
  In all this we must take our citizens, the people, along. 
Despite a turnout of only 56 percent in the European elections, 
I am convinced that the large majority of the people in Europe 
have indeed understood that no one in Europe can go it alone 
anymore. Solidarity in moving toward each other and standing 
side by side is indispensable for all peoples, whether large or 
small. 
  However, the people expect Europe to contribute with 
determination to overcoming unemployment and to promoting peace 
and, above all, internal peace. These are the issues that were 
the focus in Corfu and will be the main points of emphasis 
during the German presidency as of 1 July. If we make progress 
in these fields, we need not worry about the citizens' support. 
[applause] 
  The Europe of the citizens and democratic parliamentary 
legitimation -- these are inseparable elements. 
  Certain things apply already: Without the approval of the 
European Parliament no commissions can be appointed, no budget 
adopted, and no accessions effected. During our presidency the 
Federal Government will take particular care to ensure close 
cooperation among the Council, the Commission, and the 
Parliament. And we know that we have the support of the 
Bundestag in this. [applause] Right from the beginning, we 
Germans have spoken out for increasing the powers of the 
European Parliament, and we will continue to do so after the 
Maastricht Treaty. [applause] The participation of two European 
Parliament representatives in the 1996 government conference, 
which has been strongly supported by the Federal Government and 
was agreed in Corfu, is a right signal. The report on enforcing 
the principle of subsidiarity, which is due at the European 
Council in Essen, is also of great importance for a sound 
balance of the different levels. Enforcing the principle of 
subsidiarity, also by getting back European decisions, has to be 
a top priority on our agenda. [applause] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the preservation of our European way 
of 
life and our culture, and the securing of our social network 
decisively depend on our international competitiveness. With 
the aim of giving modernization an impetus, and removing 
obstacles to growth and employment, a number of important 
measures were agreed in Corfu. The projects to extend 
trans-European traffic, energy, and communication networks are a 
top priority in this connection. This includes two high-speed 
train links in Germany. For the Federal Government sound 
financing is an absolute must, and we have stated this clearly. 
What is needed in the member countries also applies to Brussels 
-- strictest budget discipline. [applause] 
  The second important sector is the reform of the labor 
market, the creation of jobs in services, the promotion of 
medium-size companies, and concentration of resources in 
research. Everyone agreed in Corfu that the reform of the 
European employment sector, which is urgently required, must not 
be postponed just because the economy shows signs of recovering. 
That would be threatening the existence of Germany as a 
business location. [applause] It is against this background 
that the Federal Government sees the independent group of 
experts that is to help the Commission with deregulation. And 
we will also work toward participation by the social partners in 
this task. 
  Modernizing Europe as a business location also means further 
ecological development of the European market. Environmental 
technology is the main growth sector of the future. We Germans 
are very far advanced and are international leaders in this 
field. [applause] It is clear for the German presidency that a 
carbon dioxide tax needs a European solution. 
  In the field of domestic and legal policy, Ladies and 
Gentlemen, a report on the prevention of international crime, 
terrorism, and the drug Mafia will be presented at the Essen 
Council. These issues, as well as asylum and immigration 
policy, touch central points of national sovereignty, which 
makes specific measures very difficult. But in no other field 
is decisive action, that means effective protection of citizens, 
more urgent and expected. The new Europe has given its citizens 
more freedom, more opportunities. Now the necessary measures 
must be taken to ensure the personal security of citizens. The 
Franco-German initiative against racism and xenophobia has been 
welcomed by our partners. And this problem, this has to be 
pointed out clearly, concerns all the member countries. At the 
European Council in Essen we will present a common strategy on 
that. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, to overcome old, deep national 
rivalries in Europe and to face the major, vital questions of 
the European nation together and with great determination -- 
this was the motive that guided our founding fathers of the 
European Community. Five years after the fall of the Berlin 
Wall and the beginning of the major changes in Europe and the 
world, this is true more than ever. However, it is true in a 
new, pan-European framework. Today we have a clearer image of 
the challenges that we have to tackle, the risks that we have to 
avoid, and the specters of the past that we have to ward off. 
If there is a special German responsibility in terms of foreign 
policy in the context of history then it is this: To build the 
Europe that we are seeking together with the new democracies in 
Central and East Europe. [applause] 
  The FRG remains an advocate for a whole Europe. The signing 
of the accession treaties with Austria and the Scandinavian 
countries, the resolutions on bringing the neighbors in Central 
and East Europe, the Baltic states, and Slovenia closer to the 
EU, confirm that Germany's picture of Europe is identical with 
that of our partners in the EU. Our partners also know that, in 
the long run, the West cannot do well if the East does not do 
well, too. [applause] 
  The law on the accession of Austria and the Scandinavian 
countries has been submitted to the Bundestag today for 
discussion and a vote. This speedy procedure, which is 
supported by a wide majority, will be a clear political signal 
to the citizens in these countries, a signal saying: You are 
cordially welcome. [applause] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, new, concrete proposals are to be 
presented to the European Council in Essen for bridging the 
difficult transition phase in which the reformist states will be 
until they can join the EU. A further opening of markets and 
closer political cooperation even in a preliminary stage are 
important for us and, as Germans, we will make special efforts 
in this connection. Prior to the Essen meeting, we will also 
have to work on the idea, which came up in Corfu, of a 
conference between the EU and all countries on the shores of the 
Mediterranean, and to conclude the customs union with Turkey. 
  The two agreements that were concluded with Moscow last week 
-- the agreement on Partnership for Peace with NATO, and the 
partnership and cooperation agreement of Corfu -- make it clear 
that Russia, too, has its place in the European home as a friend 
and partner. [applause] President Yeltsin is right when he 
says that this marks an important step for achieving unity on 
our continent. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the Franco-German initiative for the 
prevention of a new Chernobyl, the consequences of which we 
dread even to think of, was also discussed in Corfu. It must be 
our objective to shut down this dangerous reactor type as soon 
as possible. [applause] This will require alternative energy 
sources, which, will, of course, cost money, but this money 
would be well invested in the interest of all people in Europe. 
At the world economic summit in Naples, the EU will ask the 
other G-7 partners to help solve the problem. This issue 
affects everybody -- the industrial nations, and, first and 
foremost, of course, the Ukrainian Government. 
  The German presidency will take advantage of President 
Clinton's visit to Berlin on 12 July to reaffirm the friendly 
ties across the Atlantic. Without these, Europe can find 
neither its internal nor its external balance. [applause] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the ghastly television images from 
Bosnia or from our neighboring continent, Africa, which we see 
on television day after day, demonstrate that peace and freedom 
have not become a matter of course after the end of the 
East-West conflict -- not even on our European continent, which 
today numbers 36 states, not including the CIS members. This 
means that we need a joint foreign and security policy that 
really deserves this title. [applause] 
  This needs time, but the decisions of Corfu confirm the 
will to be serious about it. The talks with the parties to the 
conflict in the former Yugoslavia have entered a decisive stage. 
The Federal Government is involved in these talks within the 
framework of the contact group. Yesterday the contact group met 
and I think and know that it achieved good results. The EU, the 
United States, and Russia must offer a peace solution and make 
it clear that the patience of the international community is 
exhausted. This must be made clear to all three parties to the 
conflict. Decisive and cohesive action by the EU, Russia, and 
the United States is necessary. For us Europeans, taking over 
the administration of Mostar, headed by Administrator Hans 
Koschnick, is of particular importance. [applause] 
  The Federal Government hopes that a model for the peaceful 
coexistence of various ethnic groups can be implemented there. 
This is the only way to ensure the reconciliation of the people 
in the former Yugoslavia. It is necessary more urgently than 
ever but it is still extremely difficult to achieve it -- 
unfortunately. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the first presidency of reunited 
Germany means a particular political opportunity but also a 
particular obligation. Not only the eyes of the Europeans are 
directed at Germany and at this presidency. The Federal 
Government wants to make progress with the pending decisions. 
In addition, however, it wants to make clear that European 
integration continues to be a central issue also in reunited 
Germany. [applause] 
  We have the largest number of neighbors in Europe. For the 
first time in German history relations with all our neighbors 
are characterized by mutual will for lasting friendship and 
cooperation under one common roof. We must and will make good 
use of this opportunity. Germany's future lies in Europe. 
[applause]

  [Text] Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi has finished his 
visit to Paris. After meeting President Francois Mitterrand 
yesterday, he held talks today with Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe, who told him that France wants to see legislative 
elections organized in Algeria as soon as possible. 
  The prime minister held a news conference this afternoon, at 
the end of his two-day working visit. To those who ask his 
country to talk with the Islamists, he had this to say: 
  [Begin Sifi recording] I ask this of those who, far from the 
realities of the situation on the ground, advise us to 
negotiate: With whom? People tell us about the moderates all 
the time. There are many moderates in the National Transition 
Council. Who are the other moderates one hears about? Where 
are these moderates? Let them declare themselves, and let them 
condemn violence and terrorism. The doors of dialogue are wide 
open to them. Let them come. 
  President Zeroual and my government are in favor of dialogue 
with all those who first unequivocally and without rhetoric 
condemn violence and terrorism. [end recording]

Klaus Kinkel said here Tuesday [28 June] that he hoped the 
dispute over a successor to Jacques Delors as European 
Commission president would be resolved before an emergency EU 
summit on July 15. 
  Kinkel, speaking after talks with Italian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Martino, said: "Clearly our goal is to find a solution 
before July 15." [passage omitted] 
  Kinkel said he and Martino had discussed other candidates 
but 
he refused to say which ones. 
  Kinkel said he would meet Wednesday in London with Major and 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. "After that, we will see," he 
said.

  [Text] This morning in Madrid, Spain's King Juan Carlos 
received Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and 
minister of foreign affairs. Our minister also met Apolonio 
Ruiz Ligero, the state secretary for foreign trade. We have a 
phone report from Madrid by Andjelko Perincic: 
  The reception at the residence of the Spanish royal family 
Zarzuela, 20 kilometers from the center of Madrid, was also 
attended by Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana and Croatian 
Ambassador to Spain Sergey Morsan, and Spanish Ambassador to 
Croatia Felipe Luis de la Pena. 
  Sources of the Croat delegation said that the atmosphere was 
very friendly and the meeting lasted twice as long as is 
customary. Minister Granic informed the Spanish king about 
attempts to reintegrate Croatia's occupied areas in a peaceful 
way, and noted problems and obstructions by the Serbs in the 
implementation of the Zagreb agreements. He also spoke about 
the problems relating to the implementation of the agreement on 
the Croat-Bosnian Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and praised 
the Spanish blue helmets. 
  They also discussed cooperation between the two countries, 
in 
which respect the Spanish king lent support, particularly to the 
development of economic relations. The Spanish sovereign also 
sent greetings to Croatian President Dr. Franjo Tudjman and the 
Republic of Croatia and wished our country speedy admission into 
the European circle of countries. 
  At the Ministry of Trade and Tourism the two sides discussed 
exclusively economic cooperation and Spanish support for Croatia 
to receive financial aid as soon as possible. The Spanish side 
lent its full support to our initiative to be admitted to GATT 
as soon as possible, to obtain credits from the European Union 
[EU] PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] 
program, and to be admitted, with the credits obtained, into the 
EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development], IMF, 
and the World Bank. Everything is ready for the signing of 
bilateral Croatian-Spanish treaties: On mutual protection of 
investments and avoidance of double taxation, while agreements 
on road traffic and tourism are to be signed today. While I am 
reporting this, talks between Croatian and Spanish ministers of 
foreign affairs, Mate Granic and Javier Solana respectively, are 
in progress.

  [Text] Ankara, June 28 (A.A) -- The prime minister's 
adviser Volkan Vural on Tuesday [28 June] said that a long-term 
agreement with Russia aims at increasing Turkey's oil imports 
from that country to 3 million tonnes in return for export 
products and services to Russia from Turkey. 
  He said that presently Turkey buys one or two million tonnes 
of Russian oil as spot purchases and this could be expanded to 
three million tonnes, therefore entering a long-term agreement. 
  Vural said the oil deal would be discussed when Russian 
First 
Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets visits Turkey next month to 
consider how to increase trade and economic links. 
  `We would like to expand our exports of consumer goods to 
Russia, and we have a key interest in our investments in 
contracting and services there,' Vural said. 
  Turkey, which imports the bulk of its oil from Saudi Arabia 
and Iran, did not buy any Russian crude in the first quarter of 
this year, but took 129,000 tonnes in the same 1993 period.

<F P=106> [EC Press Release No. IP/94/39: "Russia and European Union </F>
Reach Historic Agreement To Deepen Trade and Political Ties"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The European Union and the Russian Federation have reached a 
major agreement that will boost their economic and political 
ties, increase trade and hold out the prospect for a free trade 
area between Europe and Russia. Now that the final obstacles 
have been removed, the way is clear for the new partnership and 
cooperation agreement to be signed in Corfu by Boris Yeltsin, 
the leaders of the Twelve EU member states and the European 
Commission on June 24-25. It marks the most ambitious agreement 
ever signed between the Russian Federation and one of its major 
world partners. 
  The agreement, negotiated over one and a half years by the 
European Commission will gradually draw the economies of Russia 
and the European Union closer together by lifting trade 
barriers, offering greater certainty to traders and investors 
and promoting the direct investment that the Russian economy 
needs. It also paves the way for negotiations on a free trade 
area after 1998, while establishing regular political contacts 
at all levels and promoting respect for democracy and human 
rights. 
  Welcoming the signature of the agreement, Sir Leon Brittan, 
European commissioner for external economic relations, issued 
the following statement: 
  "By creating a relationship between the European Union and 
Russia rooted in friendship, cooperation and mutual economic 
interest, this agreement marks a milestone on the road towards 
greater economic and political stability across the entire 
continent. It builds a solid framework based on mutual respect. 
For European companies particularly, it will encourage 
investment in Russia by ensuring they are treated as fairly as 
domestic companies while guaranteeing them the right to 
repatriate profits earned on the Russian market. And it will 
help cement reform in Russia by offering the prospect of free 
trade in the next century if Russia's reforms are sufficiently 
advanced by 1998." 
  On this occasion Hans van den Broek, commissioner for 
external political relations, stated: 
  "This agreement will set the European Union's political ties 
with Russia on a far sounder footing by ensuring that heads of 
government, ministers and officials meet regularly and 
systematically rather than on an ad hoc basis as at present. It 
will establish a regular political dialogue enabling the two 
sides to consult whenever the need arises. This should 
contribute to overall security and stability in Europe. At the 
same time, the agreement, which is based on a shared commitment 
to human rights and fundamental freedom, will reinforce 
political reform in Russia." 
<H5>  The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement Covers Three Main </H5>
Areas: 

  -  Political dialogue 
  -  Trade relations 
  -  The investment 
and business environment. 

<H5>  Significant Areas of Agreement Include: </H5>

  -  Substantial 
elimination of restrictions on Russian exports to the European 
Union 
  -  Rules on trade in nuclear materials 
  -  Steps to open up the 
flow of capital and improve conditions for business 
  -  Agreement on 
arrangements to allow banks and other financial services 
providers from the European Union to operate in Russia 
  -  A 
provision that the agreement could develop into a free trade 
agreement covering cross-border trade in services, the freedom 
of establishment of companies and capital movements. 

  One of the bases of the agreement is the commitment by both 
sides to respect the rule of law, to safeguard ethnic 
minorities, and to uphold human rights and multi-party 
democracy, while stating that the establishment of a market 
economy in Russia is of paramount importance. 
<H5>  The Details of the Agreement </H5>
<H5>  Political Dialogue </H5>
  The agreement seeks to strengthen political links between 
the 
EU and Russia by establishing a regular political dialogue 
between the two sides. The Russian president will meet the 
president of the European Council and Commission twice a year, 
besides regular meetings between ministers and civil servants. 
Dialogue will also be encouraged at parliamentary level. In 
addition, a cooperation council has been set up to monitor the 
agreement, also enabling the two sides to seek to bring together 
their positions on international issues of mutual concern, and 
cooperate more closely to ensure that the principles of 
democracy and human rights are respected. 
  Trade Relations 
  The agreement provides a framework which will allow Russia 
to 
become integrated into a wider European economic area. 1998 has 
been set as the date when the parties will meet to review 
progress in economic reform and decide whether to move towards a 
free trade agreement. The agreement does not seek to remove all 
tariffs right away, for Russia currently has a far higher tariff 
wall against EU imports than vice-versa, (the average weighted 
Russian tariff to the EU [European Union] is currently 12-14 
percent while the average EU tariff to Russia is under 1 
percent) suggesting that Russian industry would need time to 
adjust before tariffs were removed altogether. 
  The partnership and cooperation agreement also supports 
Russia's future accession to the General Agreement on Trade and 
Tariffs (GATT) and the World Trade Organisation (WTO), a move 
actively supported by the EU. It does this by already referring 
to certain GATT provisions while setting up a reviewing 
mechanism which will allow the agreement to be adapted to 
accommodate Russia's progressive adoption of various articles of 
the GATT. 
  The partnership and cooperation agreement confirms the 
removal of all quotas and other quantitative restrictions on 
Russian exports to the European Union, with the exception of 
certain textile and steel products. Russia does not currently 
impose any quantitative restrictions on European Union imports. 
however, the partnership and cooperation agreement recognises 
that Russia may need to introduce certain restrictions, given 
the extensive restructuring of the Russian economy. Russia 
therefore may under certain circumstances introduce some 
restrictions in sectors which are curently being restructured, 
or where there are serious social problems, or where Russian 
companies face near elimination of market share or where new 
industries are emerging. 
  These restrictions, however, can only apply for limited 
quantities of goods and for a limited time. Any proposed 
restrictions will be discussed between Russia and the European 
Union before they are applied. 
  Under the agreement, both sides agree to consult one another 
before increasing tariffs on each other's imports. This is an 
important provision. In 1993, Russia exported ECU14.8 billion 
($17.4 billion) of goods to the member states of the European 
Union, representing almost 50 per cent of its total exports. In 
the same period European Union exports to Russia were worth 
ECU11.5 billion ($13.5 billion). Since Russia is not yet a 
member of GATT, Russia is largely free to impose tariff 
protection. It is therefore necessary to ensure that there is 
adequate consultation on any proposed increase in tariffs. 
  The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement also includes a 
safeguard clause, similar to that in the GATT, which protects 
against substantial injury to domestic producers. This means 
that before curbing imports in a given product, Russia or the EU 
must show that there has been both a surge in imports and 
substantial injury caused to domestic competitors as a result -- 
either through loss of market share or a fall in profits, for 
example. The agreement also clarifies the terms on which 
defensive measures may be used against unfairly subsidised or 
"dumped" imports. In fact the impact of EU safeguards and 
anti-dumping measures has had only a negligeable economic 
impact. Only seven products from ex-USSR have faced 
anti-dumping duties, while a further eight cases are under way. 
Even if these led to anti-dumping action, the total volume of 
EU imports from ex-USSR affected would be a mere one percent. 
  The agreement also contains rules on the trade in nuclear 
materials -- both enriched and natural uranium - an issue which 
had significantly delayed the negotiation process given the 
concern of some EU countries about the impact of increased 
Russian imports on their producers. Trade in nuclear materIals 
is now covered by the agreement. The two sides will seek to 
negotiate a separate agreement covering nuclear fuels by 1997. 
A special safeguard provision will apply to trade in nuclear 
materials under which the EU will have to show that imports of 
Russian uranium have either increased greatly, or are causing 
injury to EU uranium producers, before invoking safeguard 
restrictions on those imports (i.e. the terms of the previous 
1989 ex-USSR agreement) 
<H5>  Investment and Business Environment </H5>
  The partnership and cooperation agreement introduces some 
important initiatives which will improve the ability of 
companies from the European Union to operate in Russia and also 
improve the climate for direct investment -- a critical issue 
given the vast investment needs of the Russian economy. The 
first steps in opening up the flow of capital have been taken. 
Direct investment in Russia by companies or individuals from 
the EU will be freely allowed, as will be the repatriation of 
such investments and the profits from them, removing one of the 
major disincentives to foreign companies investing in Russia. 
  As a general principle, European companies will be able to 
set up in Russia under conditions at least as favourable as 
other foreign companies, and once set up will be treated at 
least as favourably as Russian or other foreign companies. The 
same will be the case for Russian companies in the European 
Union. Once established in Russia, a European Company cannot be 
subjected to more restrictive legislation which comes into force 
up to three years afterwards. 
  Russian banks will be able to establish a subsidiary in the 
European Union and in return, the Russian market will be 
progressively opened up to European banks. This is a 
significant step, given that most foreign banks are currently 
prohibited from any activity with Russian clients. Moreover, 
Russia has agreed to abolish a decree by 1996 which would have 
maintained curbs on foreign banks, while assuring that this law 
will not apply to those five European banks - Dresdner Bank, 
Credit Lyonnais, Generale de Banque of France, Ingbank and ABN, 
AMRO of the Netherlands -- which had already been granted 
licences to operate in Russia. 
  The agreement also establishes a framework for insurance 
companies in the European Union who wish to enter the Russian 
market and also for Russian insurance companies who wish to do 
the same in the European Union. Conditions for businessmen and 
employees will be improved. There will be nondiscriminatory 
treatment of employees once they are legally employed in an EU 
member state or in Russia. Mobility of key personnel on 
temporary corporate transfers will be increased and the 
cooperation council will examine the whole area of business 
conditions, including the prompt issuing of visas and residence 
permits. 
  All these initiatives, in both the trade and investment 
sectors, will be supported by specific arrangements on taxation, 
competition, approximation of legislation and the protection of 
intellectual property rights. 
  The partnership and cooperation agreement also fosters 
economic cooperation in a wide range of areas. The objective of 
such cooperation is the expansion of the economies of both 
Russia and the European Union. 
  The European Union will provide support for economic 
cooperation through the TACIS [Technical Assistance to the CIS] 
programme, which fosters the development of harmonious and 
prosperous economic links between the European Union and the new 
independent states. Through TACIS, the EU has committed some 
ECU500 million ($588 million) to Russia between 1991 and 1993, 
mainly to promote nuclear safety, restructure state-run 
companies, set up public administrations and boost efficiency in 
farming, energy, transport and telecommunications, as well as 
providing emergency aid. 
  The partnership and cooperation agreement will only come 
into 
force after it has been ratified by the parliaments of the 
member states of the European Union, the European Parliament and 
the federal assembly of the Russian Federation. The European 
Commission will therefore prepare an interim agreement which 
will allow trade related aspects to be applied as early as 
possible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The European Union is far and away the biggest importer of 
Russian goods. figures for 1992 show that the EU's imports from 
the ex-USSR were 27 times greater than those imported by the 
United States (637 MECU [million ECU] ), 9 times greater than by 
Japan (ECU1.9 billion) and 6 times greater than by the EFTA 
[European Free Trade Association] countries (ECU3.1 billion). 
About half of the ex-USSR's total exports are sold to the EU, 
while some 40-45 percent of its imports come from the EU. 
Furthermore, the EU has become an increasingly important trading 
partner both for Russia and for the whole of the ex-USSR since 
the old system collapsed. 
  In 1993, EU imports from Russia were predominantly minerals 
(44 percent) and metals (14 percent), wood and wood products (3 
percent) chemicals and allied industries (4 percent). The share 
of imports taken up by products considered especially sensitive 
to European industry (steel, textiles, nuclear materials, 
aluminium, fish) is around 11 percent. 
  Russian imports from the EU in 1993 were predominantly 
electrical and mechanical machines and parts (30 percent), 
processed foodstuffs (16 percent), vehicles and aircrafts (11 
percent), chemicals and allied products (7 percent), optical and 
medical equipment and other precision tools (4 percent), 
plastics and rubber (2 percent). 
  Russia accounts for a little over three quarters of the EU's 
trade with the ex-USSR.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/94/1: "European Council at Corfu -- </F>
24/25 June 1994 Presidency Conclusions"; as released on 28 June] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The signature at Corfu of the treaty on accession and the 
participation of the heads of state or government from Austria, 
Sweden, Finland and Norway in the work of the European Council 
constitute an important new landmark in the history of European 
integration. 
  The acceding countries will be joining a European Union 
faced 
with rapid development after the entry into force of the treaty 
on European Union and with multiple demands addressed to it to 
play an ever increasing role in promoting security and 
prosperity on our continent and beyond. The preparatory process 
is soon to be launched for a new intergovernmental conference 
with a view to making the European Union better able to confront 
the challenges of the 21st century, including those arising from 
enlargement of the Union to the east and to the south. 
  The Austrian people have already confirmed their 
government's 
wish to participate in this unique endeavour, where independent 
and sovereign states decide freely to exercise in common some of 
their competences, in full respect of each country's history, 
culture and traditions. The European Council hopes that the 
decision of the population in the other candidate countries will 
be the same. 
  The new Member States will be in a position to make their 
influence felt in these endeavours, both with regard to 
day-to-day policy and on the long term strategic choices to be 
made. The European Council welcomes in this connection the 
additional impetus coming from these countries which are in the 
vanguard of the efforts to promote environmental and social 
protection, transparency and open government, areas considered 
essential by a large part of the Union's citizens during the 
recent election campaign for the European Parliament and echoed 
by the President of the parliament in his intervention before 
the European Council. 
  The European Council on its side stresses that openness and 
subsidiarity are essential concepts which require further 
elaboration. The Union must be built with the support of its 
citizens. 
  The European elections have also underlined that the Union 
will be judged by its citizens on the contribution it makes in 
the fight against unemployment and in the promotion of the 
internal and external security of the Union. 
  The signature of the partnership and co-operation agreement 
with Russia at the occasion of the European Council at Corfu 
marks an important event in the efforts to promote peace, 
stability and prosperity on this continent. Through this 
agreement Russia and the European Union, both of which have 
major responsibilities in these areas, will be able to intensify 
their co-operation in a large number of fields of mutual benefit 
to their peoples. 
  The past six months have seen the implementation of the new 
institutional provisions of the treaty on European Union, 
including the establishment of the committee of the regions. 
From now on this committee will make certain that the interests 
of the regions are fully taken into account in the decision 
making procedure of the Union. 
  The European Council heard a statement from the President of 
the European Parliament on the main subjects dealt with by the 
European Council and on the necessity of constructive 
co-operation between the institutions and in particular between 
the council and the parliament. Like Mr Klepsch the European 
Council welcomed the progress made in this direction in the 
implementation of the new procedures of the treaty. 
<H5>  I. White Paper </H5>
  In December 1993 the European Council in Brussels adopted a 
plan of action based on the commission white paper on a 
medium-term strategy for growth, competitiveness and employment. 
It underlined that a healthy and an open economy as well as an 
economy geared to solidarity were essential prerequisites for 
the successful implementation of this plan. 
  Signs of economic recovery are now being confirmed and 
non-inflationary economic growth is returning. The European 
Council considers it essential that the improvement in the 
economic situation should not lead to a slackening of efforts to 
promote structural adjustment in Europe but should instead be 
exploited to speed up essential reforms, particularly in the 
field of employment, where the situation is still very worrying. 
  The successful conclusion of the Uruguay round within the 
guidelines set out by the European Council has created an 
international trade policy environment which can provide 
effective support for economic recovery and job creation. The 
European Council calls on the community institutions and Member 
States to do everything necessary to complete ratification in 
time to ensure the entry into force before 1 January 1995. The 
European Union will play an active role in efforts to ensure 
that the new world trade organization can carry out effectively 
its task of ensuring observance of the rules drawn up jointly 
and promote progress in combatting unfair trade conditions. 
Environmental and social issues will also have to be discussed 
in this context. 
  The European Council on the basis of a report from the 
President of the Commission had an in depth discussion on the 
different elements of the action plan decided in the Brussels 
European Council. 
  The European Council puts particular emphasis on the 
following points which should give new impetus in the follow-up 
debate on the White Paper. 
  I. Encouragement of reforms in Member States intended to 
improve the efficiency of the systems of employment. 
  II. Specific measures with regard to fully exploiting the 
employment potential of small- and medium-sized enterprises. 
  III Reinforced coordination of research policy. 
  IV. Rapid implementation of high priority transeuropean 
projects in the field of transport and energy. 
  V. Fully exploiting the possibilities and opportunities 
offered by the information society. 
  VI. encouragement of the new model of sustainable 
development including the environmental dimension. 
<H5>  1. Improving the Employment Situation </H5>
  A sound macroeconomic environment is a sine qua non for 
success in the fight against unemployment (see point 5). 
  The resumption of economic growth will not of itself suffice 
to settle the problem of unemployment, which requires structural 
reforms both at the level of Member States and of the Union. 
  The European Council considers that increases in 
productivity 
for the rest of this century should be dedicated primarily to 
investments and jobs. This objective should be implemented in a 
spirit of solidarity and taking special account of those in 
society who are in the weakest position. The European Council 
stresses the need to maximize the potential of human resources. 
  The European Council reviewed on the basis of a report from 
the Commission the initiatives under way in the member states in 
accordance with the general objectives defined in December 1993. 
The European Council noted progress in these areas but 
considered that the efforts undertaken so far, though 
appreciable, still fall a long way short of what is necessary. 
It encourages Member States in order to win the battle for jobs 
to take further steps to implement the objectives set out in 
December. In particular: 

  -  With regard to education and 
training, the European Council concurs with the Commission's 
recommendation that a more systematic and comprehensive approach 
will be needed in many Member States in particular with regard 
to continuing training. At the Community level the European 
Council welcomes the agreement in principle by the Council on 
the two new education and training programmes (Leonardo and 
Socrates) and invites the Council and the European Parliament to 
finalize the decisions on this programme before the end of the 
year. 
  -  As regards measures to encourage employment, the European 
Council notes the Commission recommendation concerning the 
reduction of non wage labour costs, mainly on the less skilled. 
In this framework, the European Council underlines that further 
steps should be pursued, consistent with the objective of 
budgetary consolidation. 

  Accordingly, the European Council takes note of the 
discussion on the CO[.sub]2[/] energy tax issues and 
underlines the need to ensure that environmental costs are 
better reflected throughout the economy. As regards the 
promotion of economically sound formulas for the organization of 
work, the European Council notes the need to remove obstacles to 
part-time work and in general to promote new forms of 
organization of work.%With regard to developing new employment 
in connection with meeting new requirements linked to the 
quality of life and protection of the environment, the European 
Council notes that a number of initiatives have been taken but 
many of the new areas of job growth that were identified in the 
White Paper remain to be exploited. The European Council 
underlines the importance of the study to be prepared by the 
Commission before the next European Council on this 
subject.%With regard to young people, the European Council 
considers that additional emphasis should be given to those 
young people who are facing the greatest difficulties. It 
attaches high importance to ensuring as far as possible that 
young people can move from education into work; in this context 
it welcomes the Commission's youth start programme. 
  To support these efforts the European Council invites the 
Social Affairs Council, the ECOFIN council and the Commission, 
on the basis of information collected by the Commission, to keep 
progress in this area under constant review. The Council will 
report to the European Council in essen on national experiences 
which have had positive effects on employment, analyzing the 
reasons for their success, and define appropriate policy 
recommendations for adapting current policies. 
  Efforts to promote youth employment and to combat long term 
unemployment should be given particular priority in the work of 
the Council. 
  Finally the European Council invites the Commission to renew 
its efforts towards assuring the necessary social dialogue 
making full use of the new possibilities available in the treaty 
on European Union and in particular of the provisions of the 
protocol annexed to it. 
<H5>  2. The Internal Market, Competitiveness and Small- and </H5>
Medium- Sized Enterprises [SMEs] 
  The smooth operation of the internal market is essential if 
the economy is to be competitive and dynamic. This means that 
the delays in transposing certain important directives on public 
contracts, insurance, intellectual property and company law at 
national level must be remedied. Furthermore, it is essential 
that the basic principles of the single market should be 
extended to those areas, such as energy and telecommunications, 
which are still only partly covered by it while ensuring that 
the public service and town and country requirements in these 
sectors are also safeguarded. 
  The single market is implemented with due regard to 
environmental problems. The safeguard of important national 
environmental protection measures shall be secured in this 
context. 
  The single market is a fundamental aspect of community 
construction but it is not an end in itself, as was already 
pointed out in the conclusions of the Rhodes European Council in 
1988. It should be used to serve the welfare of all, in 
accordance with the tradition of social progress established in 
the history of Europe. the policy of the Union, alongside the 
policies of the Member States, should foster the affirmation of 
this social dimension. In the view of the Member States 
concerned, the recent agreement in the Council under the 
provisions of the social protocol concerning information and 
consultation of workers in multinational enterprises constitutes 
significant progress towards the realisation of this objective. 
Further advances on the same basis, including efforts aimed at 
avoiding social exclusion, are essential in a society in rapid 
transformation. The European Council also welcomed the recent 
agreements in the Council on the protection of young workers as 
well as the creation of the agency for health and safety at work. 
  Small- and medium-sized enterprises make a major 
contribution 
to growth and job creation and they should be able to benefit 
more from all the opportunities offered by the single market. 
The European Council welcomed the implementation by the Council 
of its orientations concerning interest rate subsidies for SME's 
and that the Commission has decided to devote ECU1 billion for 
the period 1994-1999 for a community initiative programme to 
help small- and medium-sized enterprises adapt to the internal 
market and to the new competitive environment. It also noted 
with interest the recent Commission initiative for an integrated 
programme in favour of small- and medium-sized enterprises, 
including action to simplify legislation and reduce 
administrative burdens on such enterprises, and the initiative 
of the Portuguese Prime Minister on the local dimension of the 
internal market and the initiatives taken by Ireland in the 
areas of social partnership and local development. The European 
Council considers that local development initiatives offer 
considerable potential for reinforcing the economic and social 
fabric of the European Union and for creating jobs. They are an 
essential element of the new model of development mentioned in 
the White Paper and will help to preserve cultural diversity 
within the Union. The European Council notes the Commission's 
intention, within the framework of the report on new potential 
sources of employment to be submitted to the European Council in 
Essen, to draw up a detailed inventory of the various actions at 
community level to foster local development and local employment 
initiatives, particularly those concerning micro-entreprises and 
handicraft industries. This inventory will be accompanied by 
the proposals deemed necessary to enhance the consistency and 
the effectiveness of those actions. 
  Regarding scientific and technological research, the 
European Council expects that the recent decision on the 
ambitious 1994-1999 framework programme, to which considerable 
funding has been allocated, will be followed up without delay by 
the rapid adoption of specific sector programmes. In this 
context the information sector and biotechnology are of 
particular importance. It also invites the Council to pursue a 
more systematic coordination of community and national research 
policies and invites the Commission to take any useful 
initiatives to promote such coordination. 
  Lastly, the European Council expressed its conviction that 
the elimination of unnecessary legal and administrative burdens 
on business and making community and national legislation 
simpler are important aspects of improving the competitiveness 
of the European Economy. It welcomes the fact that the 
Commission is pursuing its efforts to simplify existing 
community legislation and will reinforce its cost/benefit 
examination of proposed community legislation. The Commission 
also intends to launch a process of examining the impact of 
existing community and national legislation on employment and 
competitiveness. With regard to these latter aspects the 
European Council welcomes the establishment by the Commission of 
a group composed of independent personalities to assist it in 
this task and attaches high importance to its work. 
  As regards subsidiarity the Council welcomes the progress so 
far made by the Commission in acting on the report of December 
1993 and notes the Commission's undertaking to give a full 
report to Essen. 
<H5>  3. Transeuropean Networks for Transport, Energy and </H5>
Environmental Projects 
  The single market will produce all the expected positive 
effects to benefit citizens and firms only if it can rely on 
effective transeuropean networks for transport and energy. The 
European Council welcomed the work achieved so far by the group 
chaired by Mr Christophersen in accordance with the mandate 
given last December. 
  On the basis of the group's report, the European Council has 
agreed on a first priority list of 11 major transport projects, 
set out in Annex i. As far as the energy sector is concerned 
the European Council took note of the projects listed in Annex 
ii and requested the Christophersen group to continue its work 
examining in particular their economic viability. The Member 
States involved are asked to make every effort to ensure that 
all the transport projects whose preparation is sufficiently 
advanced are started up immediately and that the others are 
started up as far as possible during 1996 at the latest by 
accelerating administrative, regulatory and legal procedures. 
The European Council invites the Commission to take all useful 
initiatives in this respect including the convening where 
appropriate of project seminars aimed at coordinating the 
activities of all parties involved. 
  The European Council also attaches importance to the other 
important transport projects which are set out in the interim 
report. 
  The European Council calls on the Christophersen group 
together with the representatives of the acceding states to 
continue their work on the basis of the mandate proposed in the 
group's report studying further the extension of the 
transeuropean networks to neighbouring countries (in particular 
to Central and East European countries and to the Mediterranean 
Basin) and to prepare a final report to the European Council in 
Essen. It also asks the Christophersen group to examine the 
question of relevant networks in the field of environment. 
  As regards financing of networks, the European Council 
confirms that measures will be taken -- if proved necessary -- 
in order that priority projects do not run into financial 
obstacles which would jeopardize their implementation. It noted 
the conclusions of the ECOFIN council and the studies carried 
out by the Commission. This question will continue to be 
examined in the Christophersen group and in the ECOFIN council 
until the Essen European Council, taking account of the specific 
characteristics of each project, the leading role of private 
funding and the judicious use of existing Community resources. 
  The Council will be informed if it appears that the 
achievement of certain projects is threatened for financial 
reasons linked to insufficient profitability -- for example 
because of the length of investments or environmental 
constraints. The Council will immediately consider with the 
Commission and the EIB the appropriate responses, within the 
limits set by the financial perspectives. 
<H5>  4. The Information Society </H5>
  The European Council took note of the report from the group 
of leading figures representing the industry, operators and 
users who have been examining the various aspects of this 
question under the chairmanship of Mr Bangemann. The European 
Council considers that the current unprecedented technological 
revolution in the area of information opens up vast 
possibilities for economic progress, employment and the quality 
of life, while simultaneously representing a major challenge. 
It is primarily up to the private sector to respond to this 
challenge, by evaluating what is at stake and taking the 
necessary initiatives, notably in the matter of financing. The 
European Council, like the Commission, considers that the 
Community and its Member States do however have an important 
role to play in backing up this development by giving political 
impetus, creating a clear and stable regulatory framework 
(notably as regards access to markets, compatibility between 
networks, intellectual property rights, data protection and 
copyright) and by setting an example in areas which come under 
their aegis. The European Council agreed in general with the 
areas of application set out by the group (teleworking, distance 
learning, network for universities and research centres, 
telematic services for SMEs, road traffic management, air 
traffic control, health care networks, electronic tendering, 
administrative networks and city information highways). Also 
the importance of linguistic and cultural aspects of the 
information society was stressed by the European Council. 
  The European Council, having noted the findings of the 
Bangemann group, considers that the importance and complexity of 
the issues raised by the new information society justify the 
setting up of a permanent co-ordination instrument to ensure 
that the various parties involved -- public and private -- are 
working along the same lines. This co-ordination instrument, to 
be set up as soon as possible, should be based on the 
appointment in each Member State of a person responsible at 
ministerial level for co-ordinating all aspects of the subject 
(political, financial and regulatory) with a view inter alia to 
ensuring a co-ordinated approach in the Council. The Commission 
will act similarly. 
  At the level of the Community, the necessary regulatory 
framework has to be established as soon as possible. The 
European Council invites the Council and the European Parliament 
to adopt before the end of the year measures in the areas 
already covered by existing proposals. It also invites the 
Commission to establish as soon as possible a programme covering 
the remaining measures needed at the Community level. 
  The European Council will assess progress at its meeting in 
Essen. 
<H5>  5. The Macro-economic Environment </H5>
  Regarding major economic trends, the European Council notes 
first of all that the Member States have broadly followed the 
guidelines laid down by the European Council in December 1993. 
Inflation, which is in the process of being overcome, a return 
to exchange rate stability and an incipient reduction of public 
deficits are creating a sound basis for future growth and 
favouring the convergence of economies towards the criteria laid 
down in the Maastricht treaty for the final stage of EMU. These 
efforts must be continued in order to consolidate the fall in 
short-term interest rates and to reverse the recent upward trend 
of long-term interest rates, all of which are essential 
conditions for stimulating investment and creating jobs. 
  For all these reasons the European Council endorses the 
economic policy guidelines contained in the report submitted by 
the ECOFIN Council in accordance with article 103 of the EC 
treaty. It invites the Council to finalize the guidelines in 
the light of the conclusions of this European Council with 
regard to the implementation of the White Paper in general. 
<H5>  ii. Common Foreign and Security Policy </H5>
<H5>  a. Relations with the Mediterranean countries </H5>
  The European Council confirms the importance it attaches to 
the close links already existing with its Mediterranean partners 
and its wish to develop them still further so that the 
Mediterranean area may become an area of cooperation 
guaranteeing peace, security, stability and well-being. 
  The European Council welcomes the progress made in the 
negotiations under way with Israel for the conclusion of a new 
agreement with a wider scope of application than the 1975 
agreements and providing for a closer relationship between the 
parties on the basis of reciprocity and common interest. It 
considers that this new agreement should be supplemented by a 
separate agreement on scientific and technological cooperation. 
It also asks the Council and the Commission to do their utmost 
to ensure that these two agreements may be completed before the 
end of the year. 
  The European Council considers that these new contractual 
links will be strengthened by the development of regional 
cooperation involving Israel and the Palestinian side. 
  The European Council notes with satisfaction the progress 
made in the negotiations with Morocco and Tunisia on new 
partnership agreements. It asks the Council and the Commission 
to do their utmost to ensure that negotiations are completed 
before the end of the year. 
  The European Council also welcomes the opening of 
exploratory 
conversations between the Commission and the Egyptian 
authorities on a new partnership agreement. 
  The European Council expresses the wish of the European 
Union 
to develop existing cooperation relations with the Mashreq 
countries, taking into account the specific situation of each 
country. 
  The European Council is following closely the situation in 
Algeria. It condemns all acts of terrorism and violations of 
human rights, both against Algerians and foreign citizens. 
  The European Council encourages the rigorous pursuit of the 
national dialogue and the process of structural reform which is 
essential for the liberalization of the Algerian economy and its 
better integration into the world economy. The European Council 
notes with approval the recent ECOFIN decision to consider 
favourably a proposal for further assistance of the order of 200 
mecu, subject to Algeria's continuing implementation of its IMF 
programme and the position of the loan guarantee fund. Given 
the particular importance of this issue, the European Council 
invites the ECOFIN council to examine a Commission proposal very 
soon. 
  The European Council hopes that the internal situation in 
Algeria will improve so that relations with Algeria can develop 
in the framework of this new approach based on partnership. 
  The European Council stresses the value for all 
Mediterranean 
partners of jointly examining political, economic and social 
problems to which solutions may be more effectively sought in 
the context of regional cooperation. The European Council has 
given a mandate to the Council to evaluate, together with the 
Commission, the global policy of the European Union in the 
Mediterranean region and possible initiatives to strengthen this 
policy in the short and medium term, bearing in mind the 
possibility of convening a conference attended by the European 
Union and its Mediterranean partners. 
  This evaluation should prepare the ground for decisions at 
the European Council in Essen. 
<H5>  b. Applicant Countries </H5>
  The European Council welcomes the significant progress made 
regarding the application by Cyprus and Malta for accession to 
the European Union and considers that an essential stage in the 
preparation process could be regarded as completed. 
  The European Council asks the Council and the Commission to 
do their utmost to ensure that the negotiations with Malta and 
Cyprus with a view to the conclusion of the fourth financial 
protocols, intended in particular to support the efforts of 
Malta and Cyprus towards integration into the European Union, 
are brought to a rapid conclusion. 
  The European Council notes that in these conditions the next 
phase of enlargement of the Union will involve Cyprus and Malta. 
  The European Council, recalling relevant decisions of the 
Council of 4 October 1993, 18 April 1994 and 13 June 1994, 
reaffirms that any solution of the Cyprus problem must respect 
the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity 
of the country, in accordance with the relevant United Nations 
resolutions and high-level agreements. 
  The European Council welcomes the fact that the Europe 
agreements with Hungary and Poland are now in force and that the 
first association Council meetings at ministerial level with 
those countries have already taken place. 
  The European Council notes with satisfaction the submission 
by Hungary and Poland on 31 March and 4 April 1994 respectively 
of their applications to become members of the European Union. 
In this respect, it recalls the decisions of the Council to 
refer the two applications to the Commission in order to prepare 
its respective opinions. 
  Concerning Turkey, the European Council notes the convening 
of the EC-Turkey association council to deal in particular with 
the achievement of the customs union foreseen in the association 
agreement of 1964. 
<H5>  c. Middle East Peace Process </H5>
  The European Council warmly welcomes the Cairo agreement 
between Israel and the PLO of 4 May 1994 as an important step 
towards the full implementation of the declaration of 
principles. It pays tribute to the determination of both sides 
to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the 
region. The European Council welcomes the contribution already 
made by Member States of the European Union to the temporary 
international presence in Hebron. 
  The European Council looks forward to the establishment of 
the Palestinian authority in the Gaza Strip and Jericho which 
should lead to the early extension of its responsibilities to 
the rest of the occupied territories. Recalling the adoption by 
the Council on 19 April of a joint action in support of the 
Middle East peace process, the European Council welcomes the 
creation of a Palestinian police force and restates the Union's 
willingness to provide further assistance to move the peace 
process towards a successful conclusion. 
<H5>  d. Central and East Europe </H5>
  At the Copenhagen meeting in June 1993, the European Council 
decided that the associated countries of Central and East Europe 
which wished to do so could become members of the European Union 
as soon as they were able to fulfil the relevant obligations. 
  The Europe agreements and the decisions taken in Copenhagen 
constitute the framework for deepening relations and creating 
the context which will enable these conditions to be met. The 
further implementation of those agreements and decisions is one 
of the essential conditions for accession: their full potential 
must now be exploited with a view to preparing for accession. 
The European Council recalls the importance of the decisions 
taken by the Council on 7 March 1994 on political dialogue, 
which should be fully and effectively implemented as a matter of 
priority. 
  The European Council invites the Commission to make specific 
proposals as soon as possible for the further implementation of 
the Europe agreements and the decisions taken by the European 
Council in Copenhagen. The European Council also asks the 
presidency and the Commission to report to it for its next 
meeting on progress made on this basis, on the process of 
alignment since the Copenhagen European Council, and on the 
strategy to be followed with a view to preparing for accession. 
  This will be helped by the development of good-neighbourly 
relations, which will be the subject of the stability pact. 
  The institutional conditions for ensuring the proper 
functioning of the Union must be created at the 1996 
Intergovernmental Conference, which for that reason must take 
place before accession negotiations begin. 
  The Union and its Member States will continue their contacts 
with Slovenia with a view to establishing the best conditions 
for increased cooperation with that country. Meanwhile the 
Council will continue its examination of a draft mandate for a 
Europe agreement. 
  The European Council welcomes the fact that the negotiations 
with the Baltic states for the establishment of free trade areas 
are moving towards finalization and reiterates that the 
conclusion of Europe agreements with those countries, which will 
help them to prepare for subsequent accession, remains the aim 
of the Union. 
  The European Council expects Russia, in conformity with 
earlier commitments, to complete its troop withdrawals from 
Latvia and Estonia by 31 August 1994. 
  The European Council attaches importance to the efforts made 
by the Baltic states to develop legal and regulatory frameworks 
which conform with inter alia the recommendations of the CSCE 
High Commissioner and of the Council of Europe. It notes with 
concern the adoption by the Latvian parliament of a citizenship 
law incompatible with these recommendations and hopes that the 
draft law will be reconsidered. 
<H5>  e. Pact on Stability </H5>
  The European Council welcomes the adoption by the inaugural 
conference in Paris of the concluding documents setting in train 
the process that will lead to the conclusion of the pact on 
stability in Europe. 
  The European Council calls on the interested countries to 
give full expression now to the commitments into which they 
entered at the inaugural conference and looks forward to the 
early convening of the round tables. For its part, the Union 
reaffirms its will to mobilize its economic and financial 
instruments as its contribution to the success of this 
undertaking. 
<H5>  f. Rwanda </H5>
  The European Council expresses its horror at the genocide 
taking place in Rwanda. Those responsible should be brought to 
justice. The European Council appeals urgently to all parties to 
the conflict to stop the wanton killing of civilians and to come 
back to the negotiating table to work for peace and security for 
all, on the basis of the Arusha agreement. 
  It particularly welcomes the adoption of security council 
resolution 929 authorizing the establishment of a temporary 
operation, pending the arrival of the reinforced UNAMIR [UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda], to protect displaced persons, 
refugees, and civilians at risk in Rwanda. The European Council 
welcomes the 21 June 1994 decision of the Western European Union 
to support the efforts of its Member States which have expressed 
their willingness to contribute to this operation by ensuring 
the coordination of their contributions. 
  The European Council expresses its appreciation to the 
African countries, which have taken up the burden of so many 
refugees and are contributing to the political solution of the 
conflict. The European Union will for its part continue and 
increase its own humanitarian aid. 
<H5>  g. Southern Africa </H5>
  The European Council applauds the way in which South Africa 
has resolutely committed itself to democratic transition, 
through the exercise of moderation and national reconciliation. 
It welcomes the start of the reintegration of the country into 
its region and the larger world community and also pledges to 
support the government of this new South Africa, as it addresses 
the needs and legitimate aspirations of all its people, whom it 
now represents. 
  The European Council confirms its intention to establish 
contractual relations between the European Union and South 
Africa in order to promote economic development, trade relations 
and political dialogue with South Africa. 
  The European Council will also encourage the political 
stabilization and economic development of the Southern African 
region as a whole. In this context, the European Council 
recalls the decision to hold a ministerial conference in Berlin 
on 5 and 6 September 1994 with the SADC Member States and South 
Africa. 
  The European Council welcomes the substantial progress 
achieved in the peace process in Mozambique, which inter alia 
has made it possible for the dates of 27 and 28 October 1994 to 
be set for general elections. It invites the Council to 
consider further ways to support the peace process, in 
particular in the field of electoral assistance. 
  The European Council calls on both the government of 
Mozambique and Renamo to abide by their commitment to the 
process of national reconciliation. 
<H5>  h. Relations With the ACP States </H5>
  The European Council reaffirms its attachment to 
co-operation 
with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific 
[APC], which are facing challenges on an unprecedented scale. 
It undertakes to support them in their efforts aimed at 
economic and political reform. The mid-term review of Lome IV, 
which should result by 1 March 1995 in the revision of certain 
provisions of the agreement and the definition of the next 
financial protocol, should provide an opportunity to confirm the 
European Union's commitment to the ACP States. 
<H5>  i. Ukraine </H5>
  The European Council welcomes the signature of the 
partnership and co-operation agreement with Ukraine, which will 
help to pave the way to the development of a full and fruitful 
co-operation relationship between Ukraine and the European Union. 
  The European Council reaffirms the Union's support for the 
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, 
for the consolidation of democratic institutions and the 
achievement of market oriented economic reforms. The European 
Council emphasises in this context that success will largely 
depend on the sustained willingness and ability of the Ukrainian 
authorities to carry forward the process of economic and 
political reform. 
  The European Council welcomes the steps already taken by 
Ukraine towards the full implementation of nuclear and 
conventional disarmament agreements and calls for early 
Ukrainian ratification of the non-proliferation treaty as 
non-nuclear weapon state. 
  The European Council invites the council to continue its 
work 
on the formulation of an overall policy towards Ukraine. In 
elaborating such a policy, drawing on the full range of 
instruments available under the treaty on European Union, 
including possible joint actions, the council should follow 
these general guidelines: 

  -  Sustained support for the 
consolidation of democratic institutions, for respect for human 
rights and for the achievement of market oriented economic 
reforms; 
  -  The promotion of good neighbourly relations between 
Ukraine and its neighbours; 
  -  Cooperation with Ukraine in 
multilateral fora within an overall energy policy. 

  The European Council expresses its preoccupation with the 
global issue of nuclear safety in Ukraine. The European Council 
recommends in particular that the Chernobyl nuclear plant be 
closed definitively and as early in support of regional and 
international stability and the peaceful settlement of 
disputes;%Support for the full implementation of nuclear and 
conventional disarmament agreements;%Acceptance by Ukraine of 
internationally accepted nuclear safety standardsas possible. 
This closure should be implemented through a combination 
of: 

  -  The immediate and definitive closure of reactors 1 and 
2 of Chernobyl together with, as early as possible, the closure 
of reactor 3, subject to compensation through the termination 
and upgrading to adequate safety standards of three reactors 
under construction in Zaporoje, Rovno and Khmelnitosky; 
  -  An 
immediate structural reform of the energy sector in Ukraine, 
including an effective tariffication and pricing policy, and 
measures to promote energy saving, and the development of 
alternative sources of energy; 
  -  An immediate and determined 
effort to strengthen and upgrade construction and operation 
standards for safety in the nuclear sector, with the aim of 
achieving standards corresponding to those applied in the 
European Union. The achievement of this objective should be 
monitored by independent inspectors; 
  -  the ratification of the 
Vienna convention on nuclear liability. 

  The European Union wishes to reach an agreement with Ukraine 
on this set of actions in the field of nuclear safety and is 
prepared to provide substantial help in a comprehensive plan to 
be discussed with its partners in the forthcoming G-7 summit. 
This plan will involve financial effort from the international 
community, including international financial institutions. The 
European Union, for its part, is willing to raise 400 MECU 
[million ECU's] in EURATOM loans and, in addition, to provide 
100 Mecu over three years under the TACIS programme for this 
plan. 
  Finally, the European Union expresses the strong hope that 
the next G-7 summit in Naples will agree to propose to the 
Ukraine a joint effort to underpin the reform process, in 
particular in the field of nuclear safety. 
<H5>  j. North Korea </H5>
  The European Council is deeply concerned by the failure of 
the democratic people's republic of Korea to allow the iaea 
inspectors to complete essential inspection activities, making 
it impossible to conclude whether diversion of plutonium from 
peaceful uses has taken place. The continued failure of the 
democratic people's republic of Korea to comply with the 
provisions of the DPRK-IAEA safeguard agreement is contrary to 
its international obligations. 
  The European Council considers nuclear proliferation a major 
threat to international peace and security and recalls its 
longstanding commitment to the aims of the non-proliferation 
treaty. The European Council calls again on the democratic 
people's republic of Korea to recognise and respect its 
international responsibilities and confirms that prospects for a 
better relationship with North Korea would be greatly enhanced 
if concerns about its nuclear activities could be alleviated. 
It expresses the hope that the exchanges being pursued with 
North Korea will result rapidly in a satisfactory solution. 
<H5>  k. Latin America </H5>
  The European Council reaffirms the importance it attaches to 
its relations with Latin American countries and their regional 
groupings. It expresses its satisfaction with the progress 
achieved in the areas of democracy and respect for human rights, 
peace and disarmament, economic reforms and regional integration. 
  In this context, the European Council welcomes the 
accession of Mexico to the OECD and expresses its wish to 
strengthen its political and economic relations with this 
country. It also confirms the intention of the European Union 
to strengthen its relations with MERCOSUR. It invites the 
Council and the Commission to pursue these questions further. 
<H5>  l. Guidelines for a Joint Action on the Preparation of the </H5>
1995 Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
  The European Council, recalling its firm and full commitment 
in favour of the objective of nuclear non-proliferation stated 
in the 1990 declaration adopted by the European Council in 
Dublin, the report on Common Foreign and Security Policy 
submitted to the 1992 European Council in Lisbon as well as the 
report submitted to the 1992 European Council in Edinburgh on 
the development of the common foreign and security policy in the 
field of security, agrees that a joint action shall be adopted 
concerning the preparation of the 1995 conference of the parties 
to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). 
  The joint action should be prepared along the following 
lines: 

  -  The basis for the joint action is consensus among 
partners that the NPT should be extended indefinitely and 
unconditionally; 
  -  Joint efforts have to be made in order to 
promote this goal among states parties to the treaty which might 
not share this conviction; 
  -  The aim of universality of the NPT 
requires joint efforts in order to convince states which are not 
yet parties to the NPT to accede, if possible before 1995, and 
to assist the states ready to accede in accelerating their 
accession. 

  In order to enhance the prospects for a successful outcome 
of 
the 1995 NPT conference, demarches have to be made with a view 
to: 

  -  Promoting participation in the remaining two prepcom 
sessions in Geneva and New York respectively and the 1995 
conference itself; 
  -  Widening consensus on the aim of indefinite 
and unconditional extension of the NPT. 

<H5>  m. Former Yugoslavia </H5>
  The European Council is deeply concerned by the continuation 
of the conflict in former Yugoslavia and particularly in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina. 
  In Geneva on 13 May, the European Union along with Russia 
and 
the United States demonstrated their determination to work 
together for an early and durable settlement of the Bosnian 
conflict through negotiations. The work of the contact group 
has reached a critical stage. The European Council expects the 
parties to show the necessary political will in order to reach a 
solution to the conflict as soon as possible. 
  The European Council urges the Bosnian parties to build on 
the cease- fire agreement of 8 june 1994. This is, however, 
only a first step towards a complete cessation of hostilities 
which is essential for progress in the negotiations. The 
European Council is committed to a settlement that preserves 
Bosnia and Herzegovina as a single union within its 
internationally recognized borders, while providing for 
constitutional arrangements that establish the relationship 
between the Bosniac-Croat and Bosnian Serb entities on the basis 
of a territorial arrangement which would allocate 51% of the 
territory to the Bosniac-Croat entity and 49% to the Bosnian 
Serb entity. 
  The European Council welcomes the progress made in the 
reconciliation between Bosniacs and Bosnian Croats based on the 
agreements for the establishment of the Bosniac-Croat 
Federation. The European Union has responded positively to the 
invitation to provide for the administration of Mostar for a 
period of up to two years. The European Council welcomes the 
readiness of WEU to contribute a police element to this 
administration. The European Council calls on the parties 
concerned to approve the memorandum of understanding thus 
opening the way for signature without delay. The early 
establishment of the EU administration is an important step 
towards stabilization of the situation in Bosnia. In this 
context the European Council reiterates the readiness of the 
European Union to make its contribution to rehabilitation, the 
return of refugees and reconstruction in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
within the framework of the efforts of the international 
community. 
  The European Council expresses its disappointment at the 
cancellation of the Plitvice meeting between the Croatian 
government and the Krajina Serbs. The council calls for the 
early resumption of these talks and on the Serbs to show the 
necessary flexibility with a view to achieving a solution in the 
unpas in accordance with the action plan of the European Union. 
<H5>  iii. Cooperation on Justice and Home Affairs </H5>
<H5>  1. Racism and Xenophobia </H5>
  The European Council condemns the continuing manifestations 
of intolerance, racism and xenophobia and affirms its 
determination to step up the fight against these phenomena. 
  It welcomes the joint Franco-German initiative against 
racism 
and xenophobia in which it is proposed in particular 
to: 

  -  Constitute a consultative commission composed of 
eminent personalities charged with making recommendations on 
co-operation between governments and the various social bodies 
in favour of encouraging tolerance and understanding of 
foreigners; 
  -  Develop a global strategy at the Union level aimed 
at combating acts of racist and xenophobic violence; 
  -  Set up 
training efforts for officials in those parts of the national 
administrations most concerned by these phenomena. 

  The European Council invites the General Affairs Council to 
examine the mandate, composition and status of the consultative 
commission proposed in the Franco-German initiative and report 
to the European Council in Essen on the interim results of the 
work of that Commission. It invited the ministers of justice 
and the interior to report on their work at the next European 
Council in Essen. Finally, it requests that current work in the 
education and social affairs councils in this field should be 
speeded up in the light of the Franco-German initiative. 
  Finally, the European Council approved a detailed timetable 
and work plan with a view to the adoption by the European 
Council by the end of June 1995 of an overall strategy of the 
Union (Annex iii). 
<H5>  2. Implementation of the Priority Plan </H5>
  The European Council notes with satisfaction the progress 
made in implementing its priority action plan drawn up in 
Brussels in December 1993, including the submission by the 
Commission of a new drugs plan which proposes an important new 
framework for the prevention of drug dependency, the reduction 
of drug trafficking and action on the international level. It 
expects this work to be accelerated so that the Essen European 
Council will be able to record that concrete measures have been 
taken in all areas covered by the action plan (Europol, global 
strategy on combating drugs, common list for visas, judicial 
co-operation, asylum, co-ordination with the common foreign and 
security policy). 
  The Council underlined in general the importance of work 
within the framework of the co-operation on justice and home 
affairs to tackle the threats posed by organised crime 
(including terrorism) and drugs. It invited the justice and 
home affairs council to complete its work on preparing a 
convention setting up Europol by the beginning of October and 
agreed that Europol's remit should be extended to include 
organized crime as its next priority. The European Council 
invited the German presidency to arrange a conference with the 
Central and East European states on drugs and organized crime. 
The European Council asked the justice and home affairs council 
to reach agreement on tackling the criminal aspects of fraud and 
report back to its meeting at Essen in December. 
  In the context of preparation of the various instruments 
providing for the setting up of computerized systems, the 
problem of data protection must be given particular attention, 
notably as regards the following aspects: right of access by 
persons concerned to the system, right of appeal by individuals 
and creation of a common supervisory authority. The European 
Council asks the competent bodies to continue to give priority 
to these questions and hopes to receive a progress report at its 
meeting in December 1994. 
<H5>  iv. Preparation of the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference </H5>
  The European Council, following the Ioannina agreement, 
hereby establishes a reflection group to prepare for the 1996 
Intergovernmental Conference consisting of representatives of 
the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Member States and the 
President of the Commission. It will be chaired by a person 
appointed by the Spanish Government and begin its work in June 
1995. Two European Parliament representatives will participate 
in the work of the reflection group. The group will also have 
exchanges of views with the other institutions and organs of the 
European Union. 
  The institutions are invited to establish before the start 
of 
the work of the reflection group reports on the functioning of 
the treaty on European Union which will provide an input for the 
work of the group. 
  The reflection group will examine and elaborate ideas 
relating to the provisions of the treaty on European Union for 
which a revision is foreseen and other possible improvements in 
a spirit of democracy and openness, on the basis of the 
evaluation of the functioning of the treaty as set out in the 
reports. It will also elaborate options in the perspective of 
the future enlargement of the Union on the institutional 
questions set out in the conclusions of the european council in 
Brussels and in the Ioannina agreement. (weighting of votes, the 
threshold for qualified majority decisions, number of members of 
the Commission and any other measure deemed necessary to 
facilitate the work of the institutions and guarantee their 
effective operation in the perspective of enlargement.) 
  The Secretary General of the Council will make the necessary 
arrangements for the secretariat of the reflection group in 
agreement with its president. 
  The reflection group will report in time for the meeting of 
the European Council at the end of 1995. The procedure laid 
down in the treaty relating to revision will apply to the next 
phase. 
  The European Council took note of the intention of the 
upcoming German presidency to take bilateral contacts with 
delegations in order to prepare a decision on the designation of 
the future President of the Commission at an extroardinary 
European Council to be held in Brussels on 15 July.

Pleased With Events"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Corfu, June 25 -- [passage omitted] In 
another development in Corfu today, where the EC summit is 
drawing to a close, Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi said, "We 
are working very well to build relations with everyone," with 
reference to his and [Foreign Minister] Martino's first outing 
with the other European leaders. He said he was satisfied with 
the way the new Italian government has joined the complex 
dialogue at the summit level. 
  He reported that he and his foreign minister are fielding 
many questions on Italian positions on various issues and added, 
"The weight of the Italian delegation is expressed in the 
substance of the interventions." In this connection, he said 
Martino's remarks were on joblessness were "enlightening." 
  Talking to newspersons last night, Berlusconi managed to 
make 
a joke out of the misgiving expressed in the recent past by the 
Greek foreign minister, Theodhoros Pangalos, who cast doubt on 
the "democratic legitimacy" of the Italian government because of 
the presence in the cabinet of National Alliance ministers. 
  "He's always close, he doesn't leave me for a minute," said 
the Italian premier who also affirmed that he found Pangalos 
"very likable." "And then, he speaks excellent Italian," he 
added.

  [Excerpt] Corfu (DPA) -- With only a few days before the 
German presidency of the EU [European Union] Council begins, 
Britain has thrown the EU into a new crisis and maneuvered the 
Federal Government into an extremely awkward situation. At the 
EU summit on Corfu on Saturday [25 June], in the controversy 
over nominating a new EU Commission president, British Prime 
Minister John Major defied all other EU partners and vetoed the 
designation of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. 
  Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has been particularly 
committed to the nomination of Dehaene, is now forced to settle 
the dispute on the succession to current President Jacques 
Delors at a special summit in Brussels on 15 July. "As far as 
the chances of success are concerned, I cannot say anything 
right now," Kohl said at the conclusion of the Corfu summit. He 
would have much rather announced a decision "than having this 
problem now dumped in front of our front door." [passage

  [Editorial Report] French, German, and Italian press 
commentaries on the European Parliament (EP) elections held on 9 
and 12 June viewed the results primarily as a reflection of 
national concerns which could also lead to changes in direction 
within the European Union (EU). 
<H5>  Germany: Subdued Interest, Modest Expectations </H5>
  German press interest in the 12 June EP elections was 
diverted by the local contests in seven laender and in Munich, 
held on the same day. As noted in a 14 June commentary by 
Heribert Prantl in the Munich daily SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: "On 
the day before the election and on the day following, Europe was 
mentioned as infrequently as in the entire German election 
campaign; the EP election in Germany was a test election for the 
federal parliament, with a new European Parliament as a 
byproduct." 
  An article in the 14 June daily FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE 
observed that "...the voters in Europe have decided the 
composition of the European Parliament, but interest was 
centered not on European political concerns, but on domestic 
ones." Eberhard Wisdorff's article in the 14 June Duesseldorf 
HANDELSBLATT noted that "even if the European election cannot be 
a test case in anticipation of the Bundestag election, it 
certainly was determined by domestic politics. That can be seen 
most clearly in the example of the FDP [Free Democratic Party], 
which will not be returning to the European Parliament." Hans 
Joerg Sottorf's commentary in the same HANDELSBLATT issue termed 
the EP election "in Germany, obviously a Kohl election." 
However uncertain the 0ctober election predictions may be, the 
EP election has made one thing clear: "the Republikaner remain a 
marginal party on the right. For democracy in all of Germany, 
that is the best message from the European election". 
  A report in the 14 June HANDELSBLATT cautioned that 
Europeans 
have once again "not primarily voiced an opinion for or against 
the European unification process. In practically all national 
arenas, it was mainly an interim summing up of domestic 
politics." An editorial by Guenther Nonnenmacher in the 14 June 
FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE noted that there are no European parties 
toward which a barely identifiable "European public" might 
gravitate. The two large blocs, Socialists and Social Democrats 
on one side, Christian Democrats and conservatives on the other, 
have been dominant in the EP for years. Nonnenmacher maintained 
that this situation will persist, "a sign that Europe, despite 
much agitation in national affairs, is marked by a high measure 
of stability when viewed overall." 
<H5>  France: Warnings for Future Noted </H5>
  An editorial in the 14 June Paris daily LE MONDE questioned 
whether today's European leaders will be able to maintain the 
ideals of the EU founding fathers, now that the major challenges 
of the past have been overcome. The results of the EP elections 
provided no clear indication of the EU's ability to meet new 
challenges such as resisting the revival of nationalism and 
avoiding marginalization as the world's "center of gravity" 
moves towards Asia. 
  On one hand, the paper said, the elections had a positive 
result for the EU in that, except for Italy, the pro-European 
groups did well. On the other, the new Parliament will be "less 
European" because voter turnout was low, a sign of "growing 
indifference to the EU." France was an example of this, as the 
electorate expressed its doubts and confusion in voting for the 
"nationalist far Right," the "fundamentalist Right," and the 
"demagogic Left." The editorial asserted that political figures 
must learn from these "alarming signals." Politicians on both 
sides should act on their principles rather than their 
ambitions, before next year's presidential election. 
<H5>  Italy: Failure for Federalism Seen </H5>
  In a commentary in the Milan daily IL SOLE--24 ORE of 14 
June, Maurizio Ferrera wrote that the EP elections did not 
confirm any tendency by Europeans to proceed towards a United 
States of Europe. The new EP should bear this in mind, Ferrera 
warned, to avoid the futility and risk of setting off in the 
wrong direction. 
  Except in very few instances, the campaigns were run 
entirely 
on national issues, with little space given to the EU agenda, 
Ferrera wrote, citing the Italian campaigns. "Did anyone hear 
Forza Italia or the PDS [Democratic Party of Left] state their 
position on the institutional future of Europe?" Ferrera asked. 
In countries in which the EU was mentioned during the 
campaign--such as Denmark, France, or Great Britain--it was only 
by political groups critical or hostile to the EU. In no 
country was there serious discussion on the essential themes of 
the EU, such as enlargement, federalism, and the timeframe for 
these. This is a sign, Ferrera concluded, that the candidates 
did not believe these topics were useful when it came to 
garnering votes. 
  The low voter turnout was also another negative sign, 
Ferrera 
wrote, and two implications can be drawn from it: First, the 
legitimacy of the new EP has a small base--far from the 
"plebescite" for a stronger EP and a federal constitution hoped 
for by many outgoing deputies. Second, the Eurofederalists' 
claim of a "democratic deficit" in the EU was met by voter 
indifference. This is backed up by recent polls that show a 
general cooling of the voters towards integration. People are 
beginning to blame the EU for unemployment, higher taxes, and 
budget cuts, Ferrera wrote. In view of these negative signals, 
Ferrera continued, it would not be opportune for the new EP to 
strive immediately for federalism, full codecisionmaking powers, 
or a federal constitution, all measures set out by the outgoing 
parliament. 
  Former PCI (Italian Communist Party) deputy Aldo Rizzo in a 
commentary in the Turin daily LA STAMPA of 13 June noted that 
the best news for Europe came from Austria, a majority of whose 
electorate voted to join the EU. With Finland, Norway, and 
Sweden possibly joining before the end of the year and many 
other countries knocking on the door, Rizzo maintained, the EU 
remains a highly attractive option. 
  The election results did not show a move to the Right or the 
Left, said Rizzo; the Socialists and the center-right won in 
some countries and lost in others. The next parliament will not 
be "dominated by a political-ideological tendency. Were this 
ever to happen, it will mean that Europe has really become one 
state, a real political entity... Europe is questioning itself 
and enlarging simulataneously; it is at the same time strong and 
weak. The course it will follow will depend on the EP, but also 
to a great extent on individual member state governments," Rizzo 
concluded.

  [Text] The Hague (DPA) [dateline as received] -- The 
Netherlands want to improve its relations with Germany. In a 
joint letter to the Parliament in The Hague on Tuesday [28 
June], Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans and Defense Minister 
Relus ter Beek wrote "that in its foreign policy the Government 
must orient itself more strongly toward the position of the FRG 
in Europe and the developments in German domestic policy." 
  The letter continues: "In view of the fact that the 
Netherlands and Germany have many common interests and that many 
of their foreign policy goals are identical, there is certainly 
reason to strive for even more intensive cooperation. Because 
of the differences in the status of the two countries -- the 
Netherlands is no big power and only one of Germany's nine 
neighbors -- a German-Dutch relationship comparable to the 
German-French axis is not realistic." 
  Over the past weeks the relationship between Bonn and The 
Hague has cooled down considerably because Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl did not support Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers' candidacy for 
the succession of European Union Commission President Jacques 
Delors. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Wim Kok 
noted during the European Union summit in Corfu over the 
weekend: "Relations are tense." Obviously a lot of anger about 
the Netherlands has accumulated in Bonn over the past years. 
"We have to talk about this," Kok said.

<F P=106> [Article signed RKX: "Kok Does Not Expect Second Attempt To </F>
Form `Purple' Government To Be Successful"] 
  [Text] The Hague, 27 Jun (ANP/BELGA) -- Wim Kok, the leader 
of the Netherlands Social Democratic Party PvdA [Labor Party], 
does not see how another fresh attempt to achieve a "purple" 
coalition composed of the PvdA, the VVD [People's Party for 
Freedom and Democracy], and D66 [Democrats 66] could yet prove 
successful this time around. "The `purple' adventure has been a 
failure," Kok said at a news conference. 
  Kok said "he had made a great effort to see whether or not 
any solutions were still conceivable" following the extra 
package of demands tabled by VVD leader Bolkestein last weekend, 
who complained at further cuts on government expenditure and 
proposed further cuts in social security instead. According to 
Kok, however, it had not yet proven possible to reach agreement. 
Kok concluded that the investment in a "purple" coalition after 
seven weeks of negotiations had gone awry. The PvdA leader 
described as "strange" the VVD's complaints about cuts on the 
state budget, in view of the fact that in recent years, the VVD 
had always been the party to say that further cuts could surely 
be made. 
  On Tuesday [28 June], the PvdA will fix its standpoint. The 
main conclusion will be that new negotiations will have to focus 
on a government combining the PvdA, the CDA [Christian 
Democratic Appeal], and D66.

<F P=106> [Report by David Wastell, Christopher Lockwood: "Tory </F>
Delight as Major Uses EC Veto"] 
  [Text] Corfu -- John Major surprised and delighted the 
Conservative Party last night by using Britain's veto to block 
what he called a Franco-German "carve-up" which would have 
installed Jean-Luc Dehaene, the avowedly federalist Belgian 
premier, as the successor to Jacques Delors at the helm of the 
European Commission. 
  Mr Major's move, which throws the European Community into 
temporary disarray, means a frantic search to find alternative 
candidates has now begun. Germany, which takes over the EC 
presidency from Greece on July 1, yesterday called for an 
emergency summit to be held in Brussels on July 15. 
  Many Tory MPs, including some who have been openly critical 
of Mr Major's leadership over recent months, applauded his stand. 
  One of the Prime Minister's most prominent critics on the 
backbenches, John Carlisle, said Mr Major was "at last" showing 
real strength of leadership. "Good for him. At last he has 
been wielding his predecessor's handbag. It is just exactly 
what people wanted to see." 
  Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 92 group of Tory 
right-wingers, said: "John Major has shown we mean business in 
the Community." 
  The veto raised the possibility that Britain's EC partners 
would put up alternative Belgian candidates who would be as 
unacceptable to Britain as Mr Dehaene, or that Mr Delors could 
be put forward by German diplomats for a further term. 
  The Prime Minister defended his decision, declaring to 
fellow 
leaders at the Corfu summit: "This situation is only a crisis 
if everyone wants to make it one." 
  He said at the end of the meeting: "I believe it is 
necessary even at the expense of painful decisions and difficult 
moments to make sure that we have the best candidate for this 
vitally important job." 
  The new Commission president will see the Community through 
the crucial 1996 conference which will revise the Maastricht 
Treaty and set the shape of the EC into the next century. 
  Although Mr Major yesterday appeared isolated, with all 11 
other EC countries voting to accept Mr Dehaene, he drew support 
from several of his partners for his tough stand against the 
imposition of Mr Dehaene without proper consultation. Italy, in 
particular, though reluctantly agreeing with the majority, has 
been infuriated by the attempt by France and Germany to 
steamroller Mr Dehaene's appointment through. 
  "It is important that someone has reminded us of the 
importance of principles," said Antonio Martino, Italy's foreign 
minister. The Dutch, too, were forced to withdraw their prime 
minister, Ruud Lubbers, as a candidate, and have spoken out 
against the tactics of the Dehaene camp. Sir Leon Brittan, who 
Mr Major described as the best candidate for the job, failed to 
win the support of a single other country, and withdrew from the 
contest yesterday morning at the same time as Mr Lubbers. 
  Explaining why he has continued to oppose Mr Dehaene after 
everyone else had come round to him, Mr Major said: "What I 
could not understand is why, when at a very late stage, and 
since everyone has expressed approval of the qualities of Sir 
Leon and of Mr Lubbers, we should drop two such well-qualified 
candidates for one who was in my view less well qualified." 
  Mr Major said he liked Mr Dehaene personally but the Belgian 
premier came from "a tradition of big government and of 
intervention. That's not my position; it is a tradition that is 
not quite in touch with the direction in which Europe is now 
moving. We need a Commission president whose instincts are for 
enterprise, openness and subsidiarity." 
  The Prime Minister revealed that, since rumours of Mr 
Dehaene's candidacy began to circulate earlier this year, he had 
indicated "on more than one occasion" to the Belgian government, 
to Mr Dehaene's office and to the Greek presidency that he would 
not be able to support his appointment. Under the EC's rules, 
the Commission president must be agreed "by common accord." 
  Unlike Mr Lubbers and Sir Leon, who openly declared 
themselves well in advance, Mr Dehaene announced his bid just a 
week before the summit, weeks after a Franco-German summit 
agreed jointly to back him. 
  Mr Major said he also objected to the way Mr Dehaene had 
emerged as the leading candidate despite the fact that a 
majority of member states had not been consulted. But his 
attack on Mr Dehaene's fitness for the job brought a stinging 
rebuke from German officials, foreshadowing a period of cool 
relations with Britain. One said: "You cannot call the prime 
minister of a neighbouring EC country badly qualified. 
Politically this is very damaging." 
  Last night neither President Mitterrand nor Chancellor Kohl 
was prepared to commit himself to continuing their support for 
Mr Dehaene. Diplomats speculated that the search for other 
candidates has begun. Peter Sutherland the Irish 
director-general of GATT, is now the most prominent name. A 
former EC commissioner, he is well qualified. But the Reynolds 
government is reluctant to nominate a member of the opposition 
Fine Gael. 
  The decision by the Greek hosts to abandon the attempt to 
decide on his successor followed intense discussions and some 
sharp words. At times the arrangements degenerated into 
near-farce, including an emergency U-turn on narrow, winding 
Corfu roads by the Irish motorcade after Mr Reynolds was 
summoned back to a late-night meeting which he thought had 
broken up.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Time for Europe To Search Again"] </F>
  [Text] For once the British may be right in standing alone 
in Europe. 
  John Major's refusal to compromise over the choice of a new 
President of the European Commission will certainly infuriate 
the Germans, who had hoped that the issue would be settled 
neatly before they take over the six-month rotating presidency 
of the Union next month. It will doubtless make Britain look 
once again as if it is intent on stopping Europe's progress, the 
bad-tempered child who would rather take the ball away than 
continue playing a game it is losing. 
  If Britain is doing the right thing on this occasion, it is 
doing so for all the wrong reasons. The idea, promulgated by 
John Major and Douglas Hurd yesterday that Britain was opposing 
the Franco-German candidate, Jean-Luc Dehaene, because of the 
manner of the choosing -- rather than the man who would have 
been chosen -- is so much hogwash. 
  The President of the Commission has always been chosen 
behind 
the scenes by the leaders of the European states. Helmut Kohl 
raised the name of Dehaene to John Major a couple of months ago 
and received no objection. Indeed, the Prime Minister had none 
at that time. 
  What has happened since is that the presidency has become an 
issue in the Conservative Party, a litmus test of Major's 
willingness to stand up against the Continentals. The Prime 
Minister has chosen to take his stand for reasons wholly of 
domestic politics, and he will be condemned by his major 
European colleagues as a man who can never be depended on. 
  But he will also gain the quiet approval of other smaller 
countries which fear, and dislike, being bounced into things by 
the self-approved Holy Alliance of France and Germany. The 
manner of choosing a Commission President was not aided by the 
unfortunate fact that the presidency of the Union was held by 
Greece, which had neither the skilled officials nor the 
necessary interest to prepare the Corfu summit fully -- or in 
chairing it once it started. But the process was also badly 
handled by France and Germany. 
  They wanted a candidate amenable to their joint purposes. 
They were also desperately anxious to get Europe on the move 
again after the setbacks of the Maastricht ratification 
processes and in preparation for their successive occupation of 
the presidency of the Union. 
  The style in which they announced their desire to merge 
their 
presidencies and their choice of candidate -- let alone the 
personal and petty hostility shown by Chancellor Kohl against 
the alternative candidacy of the Dutch Prime Minister, Ruud 
Lubbers -- was bound to cause offence to other smaller countries. 
  Britain cannot possibly hope to lead a new unholy alliance 
of 
southern countries against the joint might of France and 
Germany. Still less can it hope to counterbalance the economic 
clout of Germany that is bound to be increased by the entry of 
Austria, Sweden and Finland. But John Major can reasonably say 
that the choice of the successor to Jacques Delors has to be 
done in a more careful and open way. 
  That choice is particularly important at this time, for the 
new man must run affairs through the critical Review Conference 
of 1996 which will consider radical reform of Europe's 
decision-making processes as well as future integration in 
military, monetary and foreign policy terms. 
  What the Commission needs is an experienced politician who 
can provide the stability and ideas to ensure that the 1996 
conference succeeds. For all his qualities, Dehaene is not 
necessarily the best man for the job. An old-fashioned 
beer-swilling fixer of a politician, he represents the world 
that has made European politics so unpopular. But then neither 
could Ruud Lubbers be called a perfect choice. Even Leon 
Brittan, practiced politician and negotiator though he is, could 
probably be considered too inept at public presentation to help 
restore public belief in Brussels. 
  There is nothing shameful in European leaders taking a step 
back now, calming their irritations and looking for another 
candidate by the time of the special summit called for 15 July. 
The Irish head of GATT, Peter Sutherland, would be an excellent 
choice. There may be others. A new man may not necessarily 
suit Britain. It has to be remembered that Jacques Delors came 
to the job only after Margaret Thatcher had vetoed the French 
first choice, Claude Cheysson. But at least now there is a 
chance to make the list more public and the manner of choosing 
more open -- and to take the final decision with a view to the 
requirements of the job rather than the national interests of 
Premiers. 
  John Major will have done no harm if he pursues this 
co-operatively. The important point is that he should approach 
the special summit in July as if he cares that Europe succeeds. 
Nothing does this country so much harm as the sense that it 
would prefer the whole institution to go away and stop bothering 
the British Government. It won't.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "After Corfu"] </F>
  [Text] In all the recriminations over the failure of the 
Corfu summit to pick a successor to Jacques Delors, European 
leaders should remember two things. First, John Major's veto 
was neither as unexpected nor as isolated as his opponents 
suggest. Secondly, the Prime Minister may not hesitate to cast 
that veto again if pushed into the same corner. 
  Helmut Kohl, in particular, must quickly learn the lesson of 
Corfu. His creature, Jean Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime 
minister, still insists he is not out of the race. German 
officials are already behaving as though they can use the weight 
of their presidency to quash British objections. They have not 
absorbed the truth of what has happened: that the eventual 
choice must be truly unanimous. When Helmut Kohl pronounced his 
own anathema, against Ruud Lubbers, Britain did not dispute his 
right to do so. In the same way Mr Major found Mr Dehaene's 
conception of the European Union outdated and unacceptable. He 
too was within his right to veto -- and rightly did so. 
  The Germans are sticking with Mr Dehaene to mitigate the 
damage of their clumsy attempt, with France, to agree the 
succession in secret conclave. It is too much to expect that 
they should drop their preferred candidate the very next day. 
But Bonn may be underestimating Mr Major's determination. The 
Dehaene supporters seem to believe that the British veto is as 
easily overturned as the last time a stand on principle was 
attempted: over the blocking minority vote it collapsed after 
only a week. The prime minister has learned his lesson. He 
coordinated his tactics properly and is arguing on much stronger 
ground. He must not back down at the second offering of a 
candidate previously declared unacceptable. 
  The Franco-German tactic will be to cause Mr Major the 
maximum embarrassment by ostentatiously consulting all parties 
beforehand -- thereby removing British objections over the way 
Mr Dehaene emerged -- and then pushing a candidate as federalist 
as Mr Dehaene. One obvious choice would be Wilfried Martens, a 
former Belgian prime minister, who would be an even worse 
outcome for Mr Major: not only does he share Mr Dehaene's views 
on Europe but he has a proven anti- British record too. Mr 
Major should not hesistate to use his veto again, if so 
pressured. 
  In the present envenomed atmosphere, Dehaene supporters are 
likely, out of pique, to veto Peter Sutherland, the Irish 
secretary- general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade. His sin is that he is both anglophone and a liberal 
free-trader. To pick him would appear to reward Mr Major for 
his obstinacy. The dark horse is Viscount Etienne Davignon, a 
former commissioner, a free-trader and a pragmatist, but also 
conveniently a Belgian. Whitehall has hinted that it could live 
with him. 
  Britain is ill-placed to propose a candidate. Several 
countries, however, owe a political debt to Mr Major. They too 
did not want Mr Dehaene but were reluctant to speak out. Mrs 
Thatcher may be gone, but the tradition of hiding behind the 
British veto remains. Italy, The Netherlands and even Denmark 
took opportunistic shelter there at Corfu. They must now 
persuade Germany to look elsewhere. This search should not be 
limited to former prime ministers and commissioners. The focus 
must be on the qualities needed to manage the Commission 
nowadays. These could be the skills of a head of a large 
corporation. Europe needs a man who knows how to keep costs 
down, streamline bureaucracy, limit empire-building and, above 
all, listen to the shareholders, in this case the Council of 
Ministers. Those qualities may be found in industry, far beyond 
the tight-knit Christian Democratic nexus in Benelux. Europe 
needs a new vision, Herr Kohl has a duty to extend his horizon.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrew Marr: "Major and the Two-Headed Beast"] </F>
  [Text] Excellent Politics, Prime Minister: shame about 
the strategy. Having reminded the country of the British veto, 
John Major picked the perfect occasion to use it. From his 
reception in the Commons, you would have thought he had ordered 
Navy gunboats into action against some hated despot rather than 
blocked a Belgian's bureaucratic ambitions in a stuffy hotel. 
There was a perception among Tory MPs that the Corfu 
confrontation was, somehow, a decisive moment. The trouble is, 
they may be right. 
  At the core of Britain's hostility to the Dehaene candidacy 
was not the man but his delivery system, the private and 
powerful Franco-German machine. It was the "stitch-up" during 
the Mulhouse summit between President Mitterrand and Chancellor 
Kohl earlier this month that really irked Mr Major. When he 
complained yesterday that the procedures before the Corfu summit 
were not satisfactory, he was referring to what Sir Teddy Taylor 
called "the blitzkrieg of the French and Germans." 
  There is a history to this that makes it rather more than 
one-off disgruntlement about inadequate consultation. For 
London in recent years, the problem with the European Union [EU] 
has not been supranationality but nationality -- the parallel 
national agendas of France and Germany. Throughout the post-war 
period the relationship between Paris and Bonn has determined 
the timing and nature of the project of European union. 
  Their bureaucracies, central bankers and political elites 
have become ever more closely interlinked. Jacques Delors 
derived his job and his power from his understanding of the need 
to work closely with Helmut Kohl. Monetary union will depend on 
Franco-Germania. So too will the nature of a new European 
defence structure. Since the Mulhouse summit, there have been 
complaints from different Whitehall departments about 
Franco-German positions, well thought- out and co-ordinated, 
being thumped down on the others' desks. 
  Nothing new there: for years, British European policy has 
been aimed at trying to break into this axis (being "at the 
heart of Europe") or, failing that, to neutralise it. The 
nightmare remains a stronger core controlled by Franco-Germania, 
from which Britain is excluded and which controls trade and 
European policy along lines inimical to our national interests. 
  Corfu may have merely strengthened the axis. Mr Major spoke 
optimistically of the need for "urgent bilateral contacts" to 
find a commonly agreed new Commission president, but it is hard 
to imagine the first calls being made to London. The Foreign 
Office takes comfort that the German presidency of the EU now 
makes it necessary for Mr Kohl to deal rather than to sulk. But 
in the longer term, there is a more serious problem about the 
direction of British policy. 
  For up to now, these national rivalries, including the issue 
of the Franco-German axis, have been held within the EU 
institutions. The Union appears as the virtual reality 
battlefield across which old balance-of-power rivalries are 
enacted. We tilt to the Italians, the Belgians cosy up to the 
Germans, et cetera. Everyone talks about the EU as 
"supranational," yet when you hear the nations talk about their 
deal-making, it can sound more reminiscent of the diplomatic and 
political tribalism of earlier generations. 
  But in the Thatcherite alternative to federalism, which is a 
web of inter-governmental deals, the window dressing of "Europe" 
and its institutions would be stripped away. The shifting 
alliances between individual nations, including the power of 
Franco-Germania, would be more blatant, unmediated by 
commissioners and institutions. That is the logic of the 
European strategy Margaret Thatcher and now John Major have 
pursued. Are we sure that a return to naked balance-of-power 
diplomacy would be an unequivocal sign of European progress? 
After all, the dream of European political union, being happily 
buried by the British Conservatives yesterday, had down-to-earth 
origins. 
  As party leader and thus as Prime Minister, Mr Major has 
been 
greatly strengthened by the last few days. Even ardent Tory 
Europhiles held no brief for Jean-Luc Dehaene and had no 
appetite for attacking the Prime Minister The crassness of the 
French and German bullying has drawn the sting of the criticism 
he might otherwise have faced for using his veto. The prospect 
of a Tory armisticg on Europe no longer looks absurd. 
  In the world of low politics, this is quite a triumph. Yet 
under the cheers and the genuine expressions of hope that Mr 
Major has finally hit a run of luck, thinking Conservatives 
ought to be worried. Their leader has steadily been remaking 
himself as a Eurosceptic, blunderingly over the qualified 
majority voting issue, rhetorically during the European election 
campaign and now confidently against the Franco-German candidate. 
  Nor is he necessarily wrong, in personal terms. His party is 
a jungle and the anti-Brussels nationalists have proved to be 
the most ruthless beasts therein. The Europhiles have slithered 
about in the undergrowth, wringing their paws and muttering dark 
warnings in the twilight. But they have not learnt from the 
carnivorous right: to influence their leader, they must snarl. 
First law of the jungle: intimidation works. 
  Now backbenchers who have spent the past two years snarling 
at Mr Major are dripping with insincere but honeyed compliments. 
Having endured attacks from people like Lords Tebbit and 
Parkinson, the man in No 10 must now endure their affection. 
Well, he has earned it. What next? Tea in the Downing Street 
rose garden with Lord Rees-Mogg? 
  I can see no going back for him now. The Tory right is 
already setting new hurdles, listing other candidates he must 
block, turning its attention to the need for a regular British 
veto on policy as well as personality. And the Eurosceptics' 
perception that they are now in effective control of the Prime 
Minister matches exactly the view of him from Paris and Bonn. 
His protestations of Euro-enthusiasm will be heard in leaden 
silence and, urged on by his new admirers, he will slip, 
willingly enough, further down the slope. 
  Which leads to where? On the optimistic Tory reading, it 
leads to a happy Europe of strong nation states co-operating one 
with another. But events of the past few days remind us how 
powerful are the national rivalries and how potent the mutual 
suspicions -- even now, even within the European project. It 
has taken years of leadership and vision to erode those 
suspicions, just a little. The trouble with the vetoing of Mr 
Dehaene is that it was part of a pattern. I wish I could be 
sure that Mr Major is as aware of how much there is for Europe 
to lose from an era of nationalism as he is of how much he 
personally can gain as a hero of the Tory right.

<F P=106> [Article by George Brock: "Beware of Europe's Cliques"] </F>
  [Text] Ten years ago this week, Jacques Attali, the 
unlamented head of the European Bank who was in those days 
right-hand-man to President Mitterrand, noted the following 
conversation between his boss and Germany's Chancellor Kohl. A 
European summit was looming and they were, naturally, bitching 
about Margaret Thatcher. 
  Kohl: I don't know where we're going. Its very difficult to 
talk to her. 
  Mitterrand: I'm not pessimistic. Britain always says "No" at 
the start, but if France and Germany do something together, it 
wants to be involved. 
  According to M Attali, the French and German leaders then 
moved on to a little horse-trading. Germany would pass up its 
chance to name the President of the European Commission, in 
favour of a Frenchman, if the French would promise to back a 
German the next time round. Herr Kohl would accept a French 
candidate "on condition that he doesn't work against the 
political initiatives which you and I will take." The Frenchman 
chosen was Jacques Delors. 
  This episode puts John Major's Corfu veto in perspective. 
Kohl and Mitterrand thought that they could bring off the same 
sort of trick a decade later by cutting an early deal for 
Jean-Luc Dehaene. They lazily assumed that the Dutch and British 
would grumble but roll over in the end. They were wrong. 
  But Mr Major has not broken any mould. M Attali's portrait 
of power-broking between Paris and Bonn captures the authentic 
flavour of high European politics then and now. High-flying 
officials, private-sector go-betweens, ambassadors and Eurocrats 
hop from capital to capital trading milk quotas, votes, slots in 
a variety of international hierarchies and, from time to time, 
ideas. What happened at Corfu was a rare failure of 
stage-management, due partly to the infirmity of the 75-year-old 
Greek Prime Minister, Andreas Papandreou, and mostly to an 
uncharacteristic blunder by Herr Kohl. 
  "The talk of dictatorship should come as no surprise to Kohl 
and Mitterrand," one German correspondent wrote, yesterday, 
echoing another who pointed out that several governments felt 
that German foreign policy was becoming increasingly ruthless. 
Mr Major exploited the grumbling resentment among the 
governments which France and Germany had taken for granted. 
Even if Herr Kohl now manages to glue the broken china back 
together, me bad-tempered dinner at Corfu exposed a gulf which 
is slowly opening between two ideas of how the EU [European 
Union] should evolve. The gap is not the much rehearsed 
difference over more federalism or less (which is moving into 
the background as other more urgent questions shoulder it aside) 
but the fight between little Europe and big Europe. 
  The defective deal to install Mr Dehaene in succession to M 
Delors was made among four of the six states which originally 
formed the EEC -- a fact which French spokesmen quickly 
underlined at Corfu. The veto wielded by John Major is written 
into the rules of the wider, formal EU of 12 states, soon to 
expand to 15 or 16. Disliking vetos used by states outside the 
founders' club and fearing the dilution of their power in a 
growing EU, France and the Benelux countries are itching to go 
back to the intimacy of the past. Could there be a new treaty 
between the six founding states? 
  Supplanting the existing, resilient EU would be impossible 
and the EU treaties are against this sort of exclusive, 
political club. Multiple speeds are inscribed in the Maastricht 
treaty on monetary union and social affairs, and opt-outs are 
either voluntary or determined by agreed rules. "Large Europe," 
perhaps 20 states in the early years of the next century, can 
only rest on a treaty shaped around individual states and their 
powers of veto. The Swedish Prime Minister, Carl Bildt, was 
asked what he thought of the stormy dinner that he and his 
fellow applicants had attended on Corfu. Rough bargaining, he 
said, but it was god to see that the veto is real. 
  The "Little Europe" states of France, Germany and Benelux 
say 
that they want to do away with the veto unleashed with such 
disruptive force by countries like Britain and Denmark. If a 
minority of five or six governments want deeper integration 
under Franco-German direction, other states cannot and should 
not want to stop them. But the larger Europe, working slowly to 
extend the benefits of stability and economic growth to East 
Europe, will still be operating. The wider continent will not 
take orders from the western end. Some decisions will still be 
made at the speed of the slowest, and the veto will continue to 
count. 
  The clash at Corfu was a small victory for the larger 
Europe, 
ponderously procedural, slow and sometimes infuriating though it 
is. But Mr Major's action should have reminded his partners that 
communities run by backroom deals tend to fall under the sway of 
their most powerful members. If Europe comes to a parting of 
the ways, Britain should avoid the small secretive clubs.

<F P=106> [Report by Tim Coone: "Dublin Pressed To Give Backing for </F>
Sutherland"] 
  [Text] Dublin -- The Irish government is coming under 
growing opposition pressure at home to give its backing to Mr 
Peter Sutherland, outgoing director-general of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as a compromise candidate to 
succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European 
Commission. 
  Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael party, is 
to table [present] an emergency motion in parliament today in an 
effort to force the government's hand on the issue. 
  "There has to be a way of re-engaging Britain with Europe," 
Mr Bruton said yesterday. ``This is Europe's biggest problem 
now. If Britain moves further away from Europe, Ireland stands 
to lose the most because of our trade dependence. Peter 
Sutherland is someone who can bridge that gap. 
  ``He is a committed European but one who can speak to the 
British in terms which does not provoke their prejudices.'' 
  Mr Sutherland was a former attorney-general in a Fine 
Gael-led government in the 1980s, and a former EU [European 
Union] competition commissioner. He would have to be a 
commissioner to be eligible for the presidency post and the 
present Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government has insisted 
that it has no intention of replacing Mr Padraig Flynn, 
Ireland's commissioner, who holds the Social Affairs portfolio 
in Brussels. 
  Ms Mary Harney, leader of the opposition Progressive 
Democrats party, which is also backing Mr Sutherland, said 
yesterday: "There is no country blocking Mr Sutherland except 
his own. There is nobody against him except the Irish 
government, which is a crazy situation."

<F P=106> [Article by Stephen Bates and Larry Elliott: "Clarke Tries </F>
To Clear Path to Tax Cuts"] 
  [Text] Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, offered the Cabinet 
a "very tough remit" on government spending in the coming year 
as ministers met in Downing Street yesterday to launch 
discussion on the targets to be agreed for announcement in 
November's Budget. 
  Treasury ministers are anxious to limit spending rises below 
the ceiling of 263 billion pounds -- excluding government debt 
interest payments and social security payments affected by the 
level of unemployment -- announced by Mr Clarke in last autumn's 
Budget. That would allow room for the tax cuts the right is 
clamouring for before the next general election, with defence 
and social security identified as early targets for restraints 
on increases. 
  Downing Street officials described the figure as a cash 
control ceiling rather than a target prompting speculation at 
Westminster that the Treasury will seek to bring in public 
spending below that level. Even so, 263 billion pounds was 
described as extremely challenging. 
  Privately, ministers believe tax cuts will be possible from 
next year, with increased contingency reserves to draw on, 
unemployment dropping, inflation steady and the deficit be low 
worst predictions. 
  Ministerial sources have suggested there may not be the need 
for the second stage next year of introducing VAT [Value Added 
Tax] on fuel, taking it from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent. 
  Options for cuts look limited, with Tory backbench defence 
specialists already limbering up to fight off a further squeeze. 
Decommissioning the 41-year-old royal yacht Britannia -- a cut 
announced yesterday -- was already prompting protests on the 
backbenches. 
  Cuts in social security, the Tory right's loudly-preferred 
option, may also prove difficult ministers fear, without 
incurring fierce public criticism for attacking the most 
vulnerable. 
  Ministers will argue their departmental case for spending 
increases before Mr Clarke's seven-strong ministerial committee 
into the autumn. The economics and the politics of the spending 
cuts/tax cuts equation, however, may prove complicated. The 
legacy of the bust-boom-bust cycle of the past 15 years means 
the economy cannot afford another consumer spree driven by tax 
cuts. Nor is it obvious that tax cuts accompanied by reductions 
in public expenditure will do down well with voters. 
  But there are at least five reasons why the Treasury should 
be able to shave a few billions off its planning totals: 
  A. Inflation has come in below the Treasury's November 
forecasts, allowing departments to provide the same level of 
service for less money. 
  B. Growth looks like being a touch stronger this year than 
the 2.5 per cent forecast in the Budget. Although the reduction 
in the number of people out of work and claiming benefit has not 
been accompanied by a rise in employment, lower dole payments 
could save the Chancellor around 1 billion pounds next year 
according to Simon Briscoe economist with S.G. Warburg. 
  C. The Chancellor's Red Book calculations contain a very low 
figure of 1 billion pounds from privatisation receipts for 
1995/96. The Government still has a 40 per cent stake in the 
two electricity generating companies, worth an estimated 4 
billion pounds, and around 5 billion pounds of other sale able 
assets. 
  D. Messrs Clarke and Portillo will be hoping to see the 
fundamental reviews of public spending bearing fruit, although 
the early favourites for deep cuts defence and social security 
spending, may not prove to be easy pickings. 
  E. The Chancellor could indulge in some financial sleight of 
hand and chop a few billions off the contingency reserve that 
the Government earmarks each year for unforeseen emergencies. 
Mr Clarke has 7 billion pounds stashed away for 1995/96 and 
10.5 billion pounds to play with in 1996/97. 
  Mr Briscoe believes that as a result of all these factors it 
should not prove too difficult to shave 5 billion pounds off the 
spending totals for this year and next. Of this, he believes 
the Chancellor will hand out 2 billion pounds in tax cuts and 
use the rest to reduce the PSBR [Public Sector Borrowing 
Requirement] by 3 billion pound. 
  Labour suggested cuts would not reduce the tax burden below 
the increases already imposed. Harriet Harman, the shadow 
Treasury spokeswoman, said: "Having hit people with the biggest 
tax increases in history, the Government is now intent On 
further damaging spending cuts which will cost jobs, undermine 
public services and seriously weaken Britain's long-term 
economic prospects." 
  Alan Beith, Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, said: "The 
Conservatives' search for short-term popularity is in danger of 
preventing prudent judgment about the level of taxation needed 
to secure investment and reduce the borrowing requirement 
without placing the burden on the most vulnerable groups in 
society."

<F P=106> [Report by Nicholas Wood and Janet Bush: "Economy on Course </F>
for Prosperity"] 
  [Text] The Government said yesterday that Britain was on 
course for a new era of prosperity after the Treasury released a 
revised forecast for growth, inflation and public borrowing this 
year. 
  Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, said the 
figures amounted to the best circumstances for sustained growth 
with low inflation that he could remember for a very long time. 
  John Major told MPs the forecast was "extremely good news 
for 
the British economy" and the Government had no intention of 
letting it slip. 
  Mr Clarke remained cautious, however, about the prospects 
for 
early tax cuts. As right-wing Conservatives seized on the 
figures to support their campaign for tax cuts in the November 
Budget, the Chancellor emphasised that he would make reductions 
only when the deficit was firmly under control. "I will be 
absolutely ruthless in delivering economic recovery first," he 
said. 
  The Chancellor was careful not to rule out a start to tax 
cutting this autumn and senior Tories indicated that they 
believed the figures would allow the party to make an early 
start on reasserting its tax-cutting credentials. They 
predicted that November tax cuts would be coupled with a fall in 
the public-sector borrowing requirement (PSBR). 
  They said if Mr Clarke delayed any good news until November 
1995 -- so that tax cuts would not take effect until April 1996, 
probably a few months before the next election -- the public 
would be likely to dismiss any changes as a cynical pre-election 
bribe. 
  The new forecast, unveiled by Mr Clarke at a Treasury press 
conference, predicts that the economy will grow by 2.75 per cent 
this year -- up from 2.5 per cent last November. This was 
coupled with a big cut in the Budget forecast for underlying 
inflation -- down from 3.25 to 2.5 per cent at the end of this 
year. Mr Clarke also shaved 2 billion pounds off his 
projections for public-sector borrowing. The deficit is now 
expected to be 36 billion pounds, falling to 28 billion pounds 
next year. 
  The Chancellor said: "The overall message is very 
encouraging. It shows a combination of monetary policies which 
are aimed primarily at low inflation and fiscal policies which 
have got the public finances under control." 
  Mr Clarke said he was not going to be "populist" about tax 
cuts, and it would be a mistake to start ringing the calendar 
with the dates of future reductions. While he was clearly 
seeking to lower expectations, probably in the hope of 
delivering a pleasant surprise in the autumn, he also sought to 
reassure Tory MPs worried that the economic recovery would not 
be accompanied by an upturn in the Government's dismal political 
fortunes. 
  "These figures give them (backbenchers) comfort because the 
economic outlook is brightening all the time... We have to be a 
credible tax cutting Government, which means we have to 
demonstrate to the public that we do indeed cut taxes when we 
can afford to do so, when we have public finances under 
control," he said. "Our main aim is to produce this economic 
recovery and then we will all cheerfully turn to tax cuts." 
  Mr Clarke's cautious approach to taxation failed to satisfy 
David Shaw, vice chairman of the backbench Tory finance 
committee. He said on BBC Radio: "It (the forecast) makes the 
case far stronger to cut taxes a bit sooner and its very 
supportive of the general argument that we should be moving in 
this Budget towards a slight easing of the tax situation. I 
hope that the Chancellor in November will put 1-3 billion pounds 
into tax reductions." 
  Gordon Brown, the shadow Chancellor, said Mr Clarke was 
being 
complacent because he had done nothing to address the 
fundamental problems of the economy. "Growth will not reach even 
3 per cent before 1996, if the Chancellor is to be believed. 
The prospects for long-term and high sustainable growth needed 
for rises in the standard of living are simply not there," he 
said. 
  Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said 
"panicky" Tory MPs were increasing pressure on the Chancellor to 
go back to the days of boom and bust. 
  The City took at face value the Chancellor's assertion that 
his growth and inflation forecasts were "prudent and sensible 
and that this was not "a government which is encouraging its 
forecasters to go wild with over-optimism." However, economists 
took issue with his predictions for the public finances, 
suggesting that they were far too cautious for political reasons. 
  Michael Saunders, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the 
American security broker, said the Government wanted to keep 
pressure on high-spending government departments as the public 
spending round begins.

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Riddell: "Labour Leadership Election </F>
Poses New Threat to Major"] 
  [Text] The election of Tony Blair as Labour leader would 
present a big threat to both John Major and Paddy Ashdown, 
according to a new MORI poll for THE TIMES. The poll shows that 
even now, a month before he is expected to be elected, Mr Blair 
is rated well ahead of Mr Major in his ability to understand 
domestic and international problems and to handle the economy. 
  If he became Labour leader, he would raise the party's 
already high rating. The Blair effect may be even larger than 
the latest figures suggest since there may already have been an 
anticipatory boost. Some of the rise in Labour support in the 
past two months, from 47 per cent in April to 52 per cent now, 
may reflect the favourable publicity about his likely election. 
If Mr Blair became leader, Labour's rating would rise a further 
three points to 55 per cent. This would be at the expense of 
the Tories (down one point to 23 per cent) and of the Liberal 
Democrats (down two points to 18 per cent). 
  Some 14 per cent of Liberal Democrat supporters say they 
would switch to Labour, with only insignificant movements in the 
other direction. Mr Blair would attract support particularly 
from middle-aged, middle-class Liberal Democrat supporters in 
the South. The party's support in the South would decline from 
28 to 24 per cent and from 24 to 20 per cent among the middle 
classes. On a two-month comparison, its support among the 
middle classes is down a quarter, and in the South it is down a 
fifth. 
  The biggest positive impact on Labour support would be among 
35- to 54-year-olds (up from 50 to 56 per cent), skilled workers 
(up from 57 to 62 per cent) and in the Midlands (up from 52 to 
57 per cent). If he became leader, the party would enjoy a 44 
to 31 per cent margin over the Tories among the middle classes. 
  Mr Blair is seen as best of the three leaders by at least a 
two- to-one margin on understanding Britain's problems and in 
handling the economy. On world problems, he is ahead of Mr 
Major by 28 to 22 per cent, and by 35 to 20 per cent on 
representing Britain in Europe. Indeed, Mr Major is in third 
place, behind Mr Ashdown, on understanding world problems and 
understanding Britain's problems. 
  The detailed figures show that public attitudes are not just 
affected by Mr Blair's general image, there are variations 
depending on the particular issue. While women take a more 
favourable view of his ability to understand world problems, the 
gender gap is reversed on understanding Britain's problems. 
  Moreover, Mr Blair's rating on these measures is well ahead 
of Neil Kinnock's when he was Labour leader. In December 1990 
and in July 1991, Mr Major was well ahead of Mr Kinnock by a 
margin of more than two-to-one on the international questions.

<F P=106> [Report by Toby Helm, Valerie Elliott: "Beckett Loses Out </F>
to `Dream Ticket'"] 
  [Text] Support for Margaret Beckett's bid to win the Labour 
deputy leadership appeared to be crumbling among MPs last night 
-- increasing the chances that a Tony Blair and John Prescott 
"dream ticket" will lead the party into the next election. 
  Mrs Beckett's recent attempts to court the Labour Left by 
suggesting that all union laws may need to be swept away and 
that the water industry might be re-nationalised under her 
leadership appear to have damaged her standing with moderate 
Labour MPs. 
  Some have also been angered at Mrs Beckett's attempts to 
portray herself as the candidate who represents "continuity" 
from John Smith. They point out that she failed to offer the 
late Labour leader unequivocal support in last October's 
conference battle over one member, one vote. 
  Last night several MPs including women, who had previously 
either nominated Mrs Beckett for the deputy job or had declined 
to name a preferred candidate, were said to have moved towards 
Mr Prescott. 
  One of those who had been undecided, Kate Hoey, MP for 
Vauxhall, said: "I think I will be voting for John Prescott 
because, although he is not the warmest person to deal with, he 
is consistent. I feel no guilt that I will not be voting for 
another woman." 
  A female colleague said: "I think Margaret has been arrogant 
in saying she is better than all the other candidates and she is 
the one who knows the party far better than everyone else. She 
has done herself no good." 
  Supporters of Mr Prescott said that enough of those who had 
nominated Mrs Beckett had now changed their minds to give him a 
lead among MPs. 
  Yesterday all the leadership candidates addressed a 
conference of the health union Unison in Scarborough. 
  Labour is ahead of the Scottish Nationalists by only two per 
cent in the by-election in Mr Smith's former seat of Monklands 
East, according to a survey. The poll for the Glasgow-based 
SUNDAY MAIL puts Labour on 45 per cent.

<F P=106> [By William Massie] </F>
  [Text] Loyalist terrorists have targeted the American 
ambassador to the Irish Republic, Jean Kennedy Smith. 
  The threat to assassinated President John F. Kennedy's 
sister 
emerged after phone calls between suspicious Protestant 
extremists were intercepted. 
  In one taped conversation they discussed action against 
targets in the south and in particular "that American bitch in 
Dublin." 
  The latest threat comes amid fears of a new Loyalist terror 
campaign in the south. 
  Mrs Kennedy Smith, 66, was appointed by President Clinton in 
March last year. 
  U.S. diplomat Dennis Sanberg said at the Dublin Embassy: 
``There is a lunatic fringe and precautions are being taken. 
The ambassador certainly appreciates the delicacy of the 
security situation. 
  ``She, more than anyone, is aware of the dangers because of 
her family.'' 
  The presence of the Kennedy clan earlier this year at the 
successful appeal of freed Guildford Four member Paul Hill 
against a murder conviction angered the Loyalist community. 
Hill is married to Mrs Kennedy Smith's niece Courtney. 
  Loyalist extremists accuse her of persuading the American 
government to back the Republic's growing "interference" in 
Ulster affairs. 
  But Mr Sanberg stressed: "The ambassador has reached out to 
the Unionists at a political level and was instrumental in 
arranging for James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist Party leader, 
to see Vice- President Al Gore." 
  The British and Irish governments yesterday discussed joint 
action against terrorists. MI5, RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] 
Special Branch and Army Intelligence have completed a hit-list 
of around 200 "players." 
  They will be rounded up when the Cabinet reintroduces 
internment. 
  But last night Irish advisers appeared reluctant to carry 
out 
a simultaneous sweep south of the border. 
  They apparently want to wait until the IRA formally rejects 
the Anglo-Irish peace initiative.

<F P=106> [Article by Conor Cruise O'Brien: "Desperation of a Deadly </F>
`Peace'"] 
  [Text] This week in Belfast, the IRA admitted 
responsibility for an attack on an RUC [Royal Ulster 
Constabulary] Land Rover which was patrolling the Shankill Road 
area during he funerals of two loyalists killed last week by 
nationalist gunfire. About the same time as the Shankill 
incident, gunmen belonging to the loyalist Ulster Volunteer 
Force [UVF] opened fire on a group of Catholics who were 
watching the Ireland-Italy football match on television in a pub 
in Loughinisland, Co Down. Six of the Catholics were killed. 
  The Downing Street Declaration of 15 December 1993 was 
intended and expected to lead to a cessation of IRA violence. 
But six months later, IRA violence continues much as before. 
The effect of the declaration was, meanwhile, to enrage the 
Unionist community, and stimulate loyalist paramilitaries into 
greater activity. The total level of violence is now higher: 
Northern Ireland is in a state of incipient civil war. The 
"peace process," which is supposed to quench the flames, is 
pouring petrol on them. 
  In its psychological effects on the two communities in 
Northern Ireland, the "peace process" works like this: the two 
communities are not in disagreement as to their understanding of 
how the peace process is working. Both sides see the British 
government as making concessions to nationalists out of anxiety 
to be rid of the problem, and in the hope of buying off the IRA. 
But their feelings about this are radically different: 
nationalists are encouraged, and Unionists alarmed. And both 
the encouragement and the alarm have the effect of stimulating 
the extremists in both communities. 
  In an interview in Boston on Monday [20 June], the Irish 
Taoiseach [Prime Minister], Albert Reynolds, announced that he 
is seeking a form of Anglo-Irish cross-border authority "with 
executive powers." This means that the nationalist demand is 
being stepped up, from the "consultative status" accorded to 
Dublin in the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to a share for Dublin in 
the actual governance of Northern Ireland. 
  Almost incredibly, this provocative statement was made on 
the 
same day that the news had broken of the massacre in 
Loughinisland. Mr Reynolds and his colleagues seem to have no 
idea of the kind of impact that their words and actions are 
making inside Northern Ireland, especially in the Protestant 
community. And Mr Major and his colleagues also seem either not 
to know or not to care what effect their trafficking with Dublin 
is having in the same quarter. Neither government appears yet to 
see the need for much more drastic security measures, applied 
evenhandedly against both sets of paramilitary godfathers. 
Internment is not ruled out, but neither is it yet being 
seriously considered. 
  Mr Reynolds's apparent bid for a share in the governance of 
Northern Ireland should not be taken literally. 
  I don't believe Dublin really wants anything of the kind. To 
share responsibility with Britain for the governing of Northern 
Ireland would be very onerous indeed for any Dublin government. 
It would mean having to carry responsibility, before the 
Catholic electorate of the Twenty-six Counties, for the actions 
of security forces (however composed in Northern Ireland). 
Those actions could well be seriously inconvenient to the 
Catholic population in Northern Ireland and, therefore, 
unpopular in the Republic. Consultative status is vastly more 
comfortable, and it is most improbable that Mr Reynolds has any 
real yearning to proceed beyond that point. 
  I think the real reason for the ostensible bid for 
constitutional limits with "executive powers" was to fend off 
change rather than bring it about. Mr Reynolds, it seems, is 
under pressure from Downing Street to consent to the amendment 
of Articles 2 and 3 of the Republic's constitution, the Articles 
that lay claim, by implication, to Northern Ireland as part of 
"the national territory" of the Irish State. Mr Reynolds does 
not want to do this, because it would be unpopular with 
important elements in his own Fianna Fail party. It might even 
result in a challenge to his own leadership of his party, 
something more vivid in his mind than the dimly conceived 
reactions of people living in Northern Ireland (and not voting 
in the Republic). 
  Albert Reynolds does not seriously propose to put the 
amendment of Articles 2 and 3 to a referendum. But neither does 
he want to irritate the British by a point-blank refusal. So he 
makes a counter-proposition which he knows the British are 
unlikely to accept and which, if they did, would be even more 
obnoxious to the Unionists than the mere retention of Articles 2 
and 3. So he makes the counter-proposition: "We'll drop 
Articles 2 and 3 if you give us a share in the government of 
Northern Ireland." That should hold Mr Major for the moment. 
  Mr Reynolds is primarily concerned with the internal 
politics 
of his side of the Border. The trouble is that the 
repercussions of that kind of politicking on the other side are 
becoming far more dangerous than the present Dublin government 
seems capable of imagining. Already the nationalist 
point-scoring that has become intrinsic to the "peace process" 
is costing more and more lives inside Northern Ireland. But 
things could get far worse, and quickly. 
  Mr Reynolds may not be too worried about destabilising 
Northern Ireland. He may even be gratified, as a politician, by 
the political browniepoints his tactics are earning him from the 
most benighted of his own backbenchers. But he should bethink 
himself that a destabilised Northern Ireland could speedily 
destabilise Republic, too. Driving a community n to desperation 
is a dangerous business, and Ulster Protestants have been driven 
far down that road. Further attempted progress down the 
nationalist agenda could be fatal. 
  I don't think John Major is likely to make much further 
progress. The results of the Downing Street Declaration have 
hardly been encouraging for him and the parliamentary arithmetic 
is against further concessions. But a future Labour government 
would be under pressure to show itself even nicer to Irish 
nationalists than Tories have been. In that connection, the 
sort of thing Mr Reynolds was talking about this week -- joint 
administration -- could well be attempted. If it were, it would 
precipitate a revolt among Ulster Protestants. British troops 
would be under fire from both sides, and British withdrawal 
would follow. The consequences would be shattering, for the 
North and the Republic. 
  In the Republic, there are some signs that people sense the 
danger. The leader of Fine Gae, John Bruton, has been 
courageously warning against the dangers of the course, and is 
beginning to attract significant support. I am all for 
opposition, in the Republic. But I live in mortal fear of a 
victory by the Opposition in Britain, and its probable 
consequences for Ireland.

<F P=106> [Report by Tim Coone: "Sinn Fein Supporters Warm to </F>
Ceasefire"] 
  [Text] Dublin -- Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, 
says that almost 40 per cent of submissions made to its Peace 
Commission which held five public hearings between January and 
March this year -- believed that it should encourage the IRA to 
call a unilateral ceaseffre. 
  Publishing a report on the commission's findings in Dublin 
yesterday, Mr Pat Doherty, Sinn Fein vice-president, said: "We 
will have to take on board the views of people who spoke to us. 
It has certainly informed our attitude and we would not have 
involved ourselves in dialogue with so many people if we were to 
ignore it. It would have an influence on our thinking... as to 
how we should proceed in the weeks and months ahead." 
  He said Sinn Fein would make a detailed response to the 
Downing Street declaration before the end of next month probably 
before the proposed Anglo-Irish summit -- pencilled in for the 
latter part of the month. A document had already been drafted 
by the party's national executive, he said, which must be 
discussed with party members first. "But this will not unduly 
delay our response," he said. 
  The report published yesterday is a summary of the 280 
submissions made to the commission from across Northern Ireland 
and the Irish Republic during the five hearings. 
  It does not make any specific recommendations, but it does 
highlight two points which are likely to be central to Sinn 
Fein's response to the Downing Street declaration, namely the 
so-called unionist veto and the issue of demilitarisation. The 
report notes: "A huge range of submissions felt...that the 
declaration had fudged the issue of self-determination" and says 
that "the need to remove the veto" should be subject to "further 
debate and discussion." 
  Mr Doherty insisted that majority consent in Northern 
Ireland 
to constitutional change, as embodied in the Downing Street 
declaration, was distinct from the unionist veto. He added: 
"The Irish nation is bigger than the unionist 
population...consent means (unionist) involvement and maybe even 
more than that, but there cannot be a veto." He said Sinn Fein 
was also looking for a means to achieve "a total 
demilitarisation of the conflict" rather than focusing on just 
one aspect of it, namely the IRA. 
  Sinn Fein thus appears to be moving towards proposing an 
extended IRA ceasefire, as opposed to the total cessation of 
violence as demanded by the two governments. This would be in 
the hope firstly of shifting the political pressure on to the 
loyalist paramilitaries.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl is confident 
that a candidate who is supported by all 12 European Union [EU] 
member states can be found to succeed EU Commission President 
Jacques Delors before the constituting session of the European 
Parliament. 
  Kohl said Wednesday [29 June] on SAT-1 television that, 
first 
of all, one has to ask each country whether there is a 
possibility of agreeing on the candidacy of Belgian Prime 
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. "Then we have to see," the 
chancellor said. He stated, however, that it is completely 
absurd to speak of a lasting and profound crisis in the EU 
because of this issue. At the EU summit in Corfu last weekend, 
Dehaene's nomination failed because of Britain's veto.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Two days after the Saxony Anhalt 
Landtag election, leading Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] officials spoke out in favor of electing Reinhard 
Hoeppner, the SPD candidate, as new minister president. 
Meanwhile, the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union [CDU/CSU] on Tuesday [28 June] warned Hoeppner and the SPD 
against a "popular front alliance" with the Party of Democratic 
Socialism [PDS]. 
  In an interview with STERN magazine, Lower Saxon Minister 
President Gerhard Schroeder (SPD) said that, in the sphere of 
social policy, the PDS was certainly closer to the SPD than the 
CDU on some points. On north German radio, Schroeder said that 
questions of possible forms of cooperation between the SPD and 
the PDS would have to be answered in Saxony Anhalt. 
  In an interview for STERN magazine, Deputy SPD Chairman 
Oskar 
Lafontaine described the CDU warnings against the PDS as 
"impertinent." "After all, it was the CDU that took over the 
East CDU, an affiliate of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, 
and all its assets. Kohl is not only -- what irony of history 
-- Adenauer's grandson but also Honecker's heir," Lafontaine 
said in the interview, parts of which were made available to 
DPA. In Lafontaine's view, there can only be one consequence 
after the election in Saxony Anhalt: "Hoeppner must become 
minister president." 
  For Juergen Ruettgers, the parliamentary manager of the 
CDU/CSU Bundestag group, the voters of Saxony Anhalt decided 
that the CDU should form a government. In his view, the Saxony 
Anhalt SPD group is under pressure from the federal party. "The 
SPD has broken Hoeppner's backbone," Ruettgers said. The 
discussion on the PDS tolerating an SPD minority government only 
makes sense when "popular front alliances" can no longer be 
ruled out. 
  Similar arguments were brought forth by Johannes Gerster, 
deputy chairman of the CDU/CSU Bundestag group, and Michael 
Glos, head of the CSU group in the Bundestag. If the SPD were 
to accept the support of the PDS in the election of minister 
president, then Willy Brandt's words that those things that 
belong together will grow together would become reality in the 
socialist sector, Glos said. Gerster told NEUE OSNABRUECKER 
ZEITUNG that the SPD-Greens minority government, which the SPD 
was seeking, would "directly lead to a popular front alliance." 
SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping and Hoeppner seem to have become 
megalomaniac to believe that the CDU would tolerate a minority 
government between the SPD and Alliance 90/Greens, Gerster said.

<F P=106> [Report by "M.G.": "Defense Ministry Admits That Military </F>
Expenditure Will Not Rise Over Next Three Years"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Secretary of State for Defense Antoni 
Flos admitted in Congress yesterday that his ministry's budget 
will not rise in terms of GDP over the next three years. The 
defense budget currently represents 1.3 percent of GDP and, 
according to a Congress resolution of July 1991, should reach 2 
percent at the end of the decade. According to the figures 
provided by Flos yesterday, military expenditure will rise at 
approximately the same rate as GDP, which is expected to 
increase by just over 1 percent this year. 
  The Defense Ministry official explained that this forecast 
does not reflect his wishes, but is the result of the framework 
budget set by the Finance Ministry for the next few years and an 
argument between the two ministries in which there was "blood, 
sweat, and tears." Flos stated that with these forecasts it is 
"virtually impossible to carry out the Army modernization 
program," which envisages overall expenditure on the replacement 
of equipment of 506.408 billion pesetas in the 1995-2002 period. 
  During the next fiscal year, Army expenditure will total 33 
billion pesetas -- virtually the same sum as this year -- 21 
billion pesetas of which have already been committed. Nor will 
it be possible, he added, to have the 5 billion pesetas per year 
for infrastructure required by the implementation of the Master 
Plan [Plan Norte] for the Army's redeployment, unless the 
Defense Ministry raises additional revenue through the sale of 
barracks. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Ann-Leena Mikiver and Ragnar Roos: "Tactical </F>
Voters Will Decide Election"] 
  [Text] This fall's election will be decided by the small 
parties. With four parties hovering around the 4-percent 
barrier, glorious days are ahead for party strategists. 
Receiving 3.9 percent of the vote will mean having no seats and 
being out in the cold, while 4.1 percent will mean 14 seats and 
a chance at cooperation in the government. The difference 
amounts to about 150,000 votes. 
  If, for example, New Democracy splits and disappears from 
the 
Riksdag, that will presumably wreck the only chance for a 
government across the bloc boundary -- meaning, in fact, a 
coalition government consisting of the Social Democrats and the 
Liberal Party. 
  New Democracy's future will probably be decided as early as 
this weekend, when the party holds its special congress. With 
the party standing at about 2 percent in the polls, its party 
group split into three factions, and a palace revolution under 
way against the party leader, the odds do not look good. 
  But this does not necessarily mean that the party is on its 
way out. That depends on how skillful it is at persuading 
"tactical voters." 
  The reason is that all four small parties are swarming with 
tactical voters, who are fickle by nature. 
  A full four out of every 10 New Democracy voters actually 
favored a different party in the last election, according to a 
voter poll by election researchers Mikael Gilljam and Soren 
Holmberg. The most common case was that of a Moderate Party 
voter who voted for New Democracy just to get fresh faces in the 
Riksdag. 
  The Green Party's electorate also includes a great many 
unfaithful voters. One-fourth of its voters actually favored 
some other party -- in this case mostly the Liberal Party or the 
Social Democratic Party [SDP]. 
  Of the KDS [Christian Democratic Party] voters, 14 percent 
actually favored another party -- not unexpectedly, the Moderate 
Party. On the other hand, the Left Party, which by tradition has 
always had a large element of tactical voters, has lost some of 
its attractiveness in recent elections. Among those who voted 
for it in 1991, only 10 percent were SDP supporters. That has 
favored the Social Democrats. 
  The question, then, is what the tactical voters will do in 
this fall's election: Will they abandon a sinking ship or put 
their votes on the line to save it? 
  Things look brightest for the Left Party. Although that 
party 
has not yet benefited to any great extent from the wind blowing 
to the left, it has the longest tradition of tactical voting. It 
is strange, however, that the Left Party has not done better at 
exploiting the feminist winds that are blowing, especially since 
the party's leader is a woman. For the moment, it seems that 
women prefer the SDP and the Liberal Party. It is also true that 
Gudrun Schyman lacks Lars Werner's folksiness, and she will 
probably never equal him in popularity. 
  With the child care allowance, the KDS has lost its only 
distinctive issue in this fall's election. "Further 
improvements" is a message that presumably will not sell as 
well. The KDS will no doubt be wiser to become the 
nonsocialists' "comrade 4 percent." Alf Svensson will presumably 
be able to attract votes by standing out as a more obvious 
supporter of a nonsocialist (Moderate) government than Olof 
Johansson and Bengt Westerberg. 
  Both the Left Party and the KDS are helped by the fact that 
they have taken a clear stand on the government issue. This 
fall's election will be between two clear alternatives for 
government, and the focus will be on the big issues: the economy 
and unemployment. 
  The Green Party has cleared away most of its internal 
conflicts, and that should bring some of its voters back. But 
the party is empty-handed on economic issues, its profile is 
fuzzy, its right wing from 1988 has still not returned, and its 
set of leaders is a little weak. 
  "The party must come across properly in the media, otherwise 
it probably won't succeed," says Mikael Gilljam. 
  What about New Democracy, then? Well, if the party still 
exists in its present form after this weekend's special 
congress, it will presumably have to make a big effort. 
  "It will probably be saved only if Bert Karlsson takes 
command and succeeds in attracting conservative opponents of the 
EU [European Union]," says Mikael Gilljam. 
<H5>  Strong and Weak Points of Small Parties </H5>
  The Left Party (leader: Gudrun Schyman) is in an extremely 
strong position in terms of its opposition to the EU, and its 
stands on the environment and women's issues are strong points. 
It is neither strong nor weak as "comrade 4 percent." Schyman is 
a weak point. Faithful tactical voters may save the day for this 
party, although their numbers are dwindling. 
  The Green Party (leader: Birger Schlaug) is in a very strong 
position in terms of its opposition to the EU and its stands on 
the environment and the bridge over the Sound, but is extremely 
weak in that it has not chosen sides and from the standpoint 
that it is a single-issue party. The party probably needs a 
nuclear accident, a couple of dead seals, or a comeback by Asa 
Domeij. 
  The KDS (leader: Alf Svensson) is in a strong position in 
terms of its family policy and a very strong position as a 
"nonsocialist guarantor." Its stand in support of Christian 
morality is an extremely weak point, and its stand on the child 
care allowance is also a weak point. Having Alf Svensson as its 
leader is an extremely strong point. The child care allowance is 
dead as an election issue, although the KDS will certainly try 
to revive it once again. 
  New Democracy (leader: Harriet Colliander) is extremely weak 
from the standpoint of its internal split, its leadership 
crisis, and its fuzzy profile. Its stand on the refugee issue is 
an extremely strong point. As things stand now, there is no 
chance that the party will win any seats in the Riksdag. 
<H5>  Forming New Government May Be Harder Than Ever </H5>
  Forming a new government after this fall's election may be 
more complicated than ever. The more small parties there are 
that clear the 4-percent hurdle and win seats in the Riksdag, 
the more possibilities there will be for forming a government 
coalition. 
  From a purely technical standpoint, the procedure for 
equalizing representation in the Riksdag may create problems if 
three or four parties end up just above the 4-percent mark. In 
such a case, the 39 seats set aside for the equalization 
procedure will probably not suffice for ensuring a completely 
proportional distribution of seats. 
  In that case, the formation of a government may depend on 
which parties end up under- or overrepresented. 
  In the present situation, three main alternatives emerge as 
far as the government issue is concerned: 
  First, the four-party coalition could continue in power. 
Liberal Party leader Bengt Westerberg has stated firmly that he 
is not willing to be part of another nonsocialist minority 
government dependent upon New Democracy. If Westerberg keeps his 
word, what it will mean in practice is that the only chance for 
the four-party coalition's survival will be New Democracy's 
departure from the Riksdag. It seems completely unrealistic to 
think that the four parties will win their own majority and that 
the New Democrats will manage at the same time to remain in the 
Riksdag. 
  This means that from the purely technical standpoint of 
forming a government, hara-kiri by the New Democrats would make 
it easier for the four-party coalition to survive. Where New 
Democracy's former voters would go after that is another 
question. 
  This alternative would also require that Alf Svensson and 
his 
Christian Democrats persuade their voters that they are needed 
in the Riksdag for another term. The very best solution, of 
course, would be for the Left Party to pack its bags and for the 
Green Party to have to stay in its dandelion patch. 
  Second, the Social Democrats could form a government on 
their 
own. If they win their own majority, it will be just a matter of 
moving ahead. But even though they are doing well in the opinion 
polls, it is not likely that they will receive more than 50 
percent of the vote in this election. 
  But if they win such a large majority on their own that no 
other constellation of parties can form a majority, they could 
form a minority government with one or more supporting parties. 
  In that case, it would be preferable for both the KDS and 
New 
Democracy to lose their representation in the Riksdag. On the 
other hand, it would be best if the Left Party, which has 
traditionally been the guarantor of a Social Democratic minority 
government, were to remain in the Riksdag. Gudrun Schyman can 
hope that "comrade 4 percent" is still functioning. 
  Alternatively, the Social Democrats would have to seek 
support from a Green Party willing to negotiate. That is 
probably a considerably less attractive alternative. 
  After a Social Democratic government is actually formed, it 
can seek support from the Liberal Party or the Center Party on 
specific issues. 
  Third, a government across the bloc boundary will be formed 
only if none of the other alternatives is possible. In this 
case, the most likely alliance would be one between the Social 
Democrats and the Liberal Party. Bengt Westerberg and Ingvar 
Carlsson have similar views on the public sector and on welfare 
policy. The Center Party might also be brought into the 
government, but that is less likely. 
  But this alternative is based on the assumption that the 
Liberal Party will do well in the election and at least equal 
its 1991 results. The Liberal Party can scarcely enter a 
coalition government with the Social Democrats if it does worse 
this time than it did in 1991. It will also have to be wooed 
with a fairly fat offer giving it considerably more influence 
than its size warrants. 
  A government across the bloc boundary will be more likely if 
neither the Left Party nor the Green Party clears the 4-percent 
hurdle and if New Democracy hangs on in the Riksdag. 
<H5>  Guide for Tactical Voters </H5>
  If the KDS wins seats in the Riksdag but New Democracy, the 
Green Party, and the Left Party do not, the probable result will 
be a nonsocialist four-party coalition. 
  If the Left Party and the Green Party win seats but the KDS 
and New Democracy do not, the probable result will be a Social 
Democratic government. 
  If New Democracy wins seats but the Left Party and the Green 
Party do not, the probable result will be a government across 
the bloc boundary. 
  If the KDS and the Left Party win seats but New Democracy 
does not, it is probable that neither bloc will have the 
advantage.

  [Text] Paris, June 30 (AFP) -- Japan's economic slowdown 
seems about to bottom out, helped by the latest fiscal stimulus 
package, but recovery prospects could be weakened in the even of 
further upward pressure on the yen, the OECD said Thursday [30 
June]. 
  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) said Japanese output should grow by 0.75 percent in 
calendar 1994 after stagnating in 1993 at 0.1 percent. 
  But activity should pick up steam from the second half to 
reach 2.7 percent in 1995, enough to reverse the rise in 
unemployment, it said in its semi-annual Economic Outlook. 
  Japan would also likely benefit from low consumer price 
inflation both in 1994 and 1995, with rates running below 1.0 
percent. 
  With the yen's sharp rise against the dollar cutting sharply 
into Japan's export market shares, the expected upturn later 
this year would be mainly driven by expanding private 
consumption, the report said. Residential investment would also 
remain strong. 
  Weakening exports and increased imports should cut Japan's 
current account surplus to about 120 billion dollars or 2.5 
percent of GDP by 1995, roughly matching the 1992 level in 
dollar terms, from a peak of 131 bn last year, OECD projections 
showed. 
  This year's strong public investment, largely a result of 
last February's stimulatory package, was likely to fall off in 
1995, the OECD said. 
  But it should be relayed by a pickup in corporate investment 
fuelled by growing profits and expectations of a rise in 
capacity utilization. 
  The report said the business sector continues adjusting 
after 
the excesses of the "bubble economy period," with private 
investment now 15 percent below the 1991 peak level. But 
business sentiment still "improved considerably" early this year. 
  In the OECD's view, continued easy money market conditions 
should help support further progress in banks' balance sheet 
adjustment. 
  This, it said, would "contribute to generating the faster 
growth of money and credit needed for a long-lasting economic 
recovery." 
  Government policy has become more stimulative this year, 
"building on its success in turning around the growth of 
domestic demand last year," OECD economists said. 
  They said the impact of the February package on income flows 
would average 1.5 percent of GDP over the two-year period to 
end- 1995. 
  The fiscal package, combined with the 1994 budget, higher 
social security contributions and tax cuts assumed to remain at 
this year's level, could boost the overall government deficit to 
1.75 percent of GDP by 1995, from a small surplus in 1993. 
  With the official discount rate at a post-war low of 1.75 
percent since last September and the Bank of Japan pushing down 
the interest on overnight money to barely 2.0 percent by last 
May, monetary policy was also aiding the recovery, the OECD said. 
  Reflecting concerns about a larger government deficit and 
the 
rise in yields abroad, Tokyo bond yields have climbed nearly a 
percentage point since last January. But real interest rates, 
at just under 3.0 percent, remain low, it said. 
  Higher bond yields increased the cost of borrowing from 
long-term credit banks and some government-financed 
institutions, and this "may limit some private sector activity," 
the OECD said. 
  But it also said the steeper yield curve should mean that 
banks "will be better placed to increase operating profits and 
reduce the under-provisioning of bad loans, thereby allowing 
them eventually to increase lending." 
  And it stressed that, despite the bond market developments, 
the stock market rose 15 percent in the first five months of 
1994, while other East Asian markets tumbled in the wake of the 
increase in U.S. interest rates.

  [Text] Paris, June 30 (AFP) -- The Chinese economy is 
likely to grow at a sightly slower rate this year, but its real 
GDP could still expand faster than the official target of 9.0 
percent, the OECD said Thursday [30 June]. 
  This would follow two years of growth at a very fast pace of 
13 percent annually, the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development (OECD) said. 
  Inflation in China is also likely to exceed the target level 
of 10 percent, but should come down from the high level of 20 
percent recorded at the end of the first quarter, it said in its 
semi-annual Economic Outlook. 
  But, in this respect, China is faced with a "particular 
risk" 
this year, the OECD report said. 
  For policies implemented at the beginning of this year as 
part of a programme of structural reforms "are likely to 
heighten inflationary pressures in the short term." 
  It cited exchange rate reform and various tax reform 
measures, but noted a number of factors that might reduce the 
risk. 
  The overhaul of the exchange rate system, aimed at 
establishing yuan convertibility, was followed by a 45 percent 
devaluation of the "official" yuan exchange rate, the OECD noted. 
  But since only one-third of imports were at the "official" 
yuan rate, it said, the mechanical effect of this may be to add 
only around 15 percent to the total value of imports, so 
reducing the domestic price impact. 
  The government also introduced a value-added tax to boost 
central government revenue from this year, the report said. 
  It added that while price freezes on some basic consumer 
goods had "little impact" on inflation, the strict controls 
imposed recently on non-infrastrucutre investment, especially 
construction, "may prove more efficient in reining back 
inflation pressures emanating from the demand side." 
  The brisk expansion in China over the past two years was 
fuelled by "very strong domestic demand growth," as investment 
doubled between 1991 and 1993, OECD economists noted. 
  They said this placed constraints on resources available for 
exports and triggered "a surge" in imports, the value of which 
grew by nearly 30 percent. 
  Both growth and inflation were immediately reined in when 
authorities imposed an economic austerity programme last July. 
  But it also dried up liquidity in state enterprises and in 
the agricultural sector. So austerity measures were eased from 
last October, and growth and inflation quickened again. 
  Against the background of developments on the price front 
and 
the recent upturn in activity, "it is likely that although 
slowing somewhat in 1994, GDP growth and inflation will remain 
above the official targets of 9.0 and 10 percent respectively," 
the OECD said. 
  The report also noted that inflows into China of foreign 
direct investment remain "substantial," and contribute to 
boosting the already steep growth in investment. 
  China notably benefitted from appreciation of the Japanese 
yen, which encouraged transfers by Japanese investors, although 
on a smaller scale than in 1987-89. 
  The OECD said China was among the key targets of investment 
flows from Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which were concentrated 
on the countries with the lowest labour costs.

  [Text] Paris, June 30 (AFP) -- Asia's "Dragons" will be 
spitting fire over the next 18 months, with growth in their 
economies picking up steam to reach a rate of nearly 7.0 percent 
through 1995, the OECD said Thursday [30 June]. 
  The main risk to their outlook now is inflation, the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
warned. 
  For the six Dynamic Asian Economies (DAEs) -- Korea, Hong 
Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand -- are growing at 
a pace barely below their estimated potential or capacity for 
growth, it argued. 
  Forecasting average GDP growth of 6.9 percent in the six 
economies both this year and in 1995, up from 6.4 percent last 
year and 5.8 percent in 1992, it said the downtrend in annual 
expansion that began in the DAEs in 1987 was clearly reversed 
last year. 
  OECD projections put Malaysia in the lead with growth rates 
of 8.4 percent in 1994 and 8.0 percent in 1995. 
  Next came Thailand (8.2 percent both years), Singapore (8.0 
and 7.0 percent), Korea (7.0 percent both years), Taiwan (6.0 
and 6.5 percent), and Hong Kong (5.5 and 5.0 percent). 
  Noting with a streak of envy that their 1993 growth was 
"higher even than in OECD countries that were experiencing a 
recovery," the OECD's semi-annual Economic Outlook said the 
DAEs' trade performance was boosted by three factors. 
  First, domestic demand growth in China and in the DAEs 
themselves was "very strong." 
  Second, recovery in the United States and other 
English-speaking industrial countries increased demand for their 
exports. 
  And third, the DAEs competitive position was improved by the 
appreciation of the Japanese yen. 
  As an example, the OECD said the Korean car, steel and 
telecommunications industries cashed in heavily on the yen's 
rise. 
  They won large market shares in developing Asian economies, 
especially in China, which almost doubled imports from Korea in 
1993. 
  Pointing out that trade among the DAEs now accounts for 
nearly 20 percent of their overall exports, the OECD said their 
forecast brisk growth of output in 1994-95 could keep imports of 
manufactures growing by some 10-11 percent, the same rates as in 
1993. 
  This further boost to intra-regional trade could keep the 
"Dragons'" combined current account balance broadly unchanged 
after last year's rise to a surplus of just over 4 billion 
dollars. 
  The OECD said that over the next 18 months, "the main forces 
driving growth (in the DAEs) last year should continue to 
operate, or even strengthen." 
  "As recovery gets under way in Japan and Europe, export 
market growth for the countries in the area could rise to around 
8.0 percent, permitting their export volumes to rise again by 10 
percent or so," it said. 
  At the same time, domestic economic policies should continue 
to have an "overall stimulative effect" throughout the area. 
  Monetary policy was eased last year in most of these 
countries, helping to sustain buoyant domestic demand. 
  But the OECD said a tightening was probable if inflation 
were 
to accelerate beyond the projected average of 5.5 percent for 
1994-95. 
  It said an uptrend in prices could be strengthened by such 
factors as the acceleration of growth "to virtually its 
potential rate," a high level of capacity utilization, and 
special developments in some countries.

  [Text] Paris, June 30 (AFP) -- The transition to market 
economies in East and Central Europe remains "painfully slow" 
but some of these countries may have made more headway toward 
economic recovery than official data suggest, the OECD said 
Thursday [30 June]. 
  Projections by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) showed that "recorded GDP" could be expected 
to show positive growth by 1995 in most transition countries 
outside the Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former USSR. 
  Poland was likely to grow by 4.0 percent this year for the 
second year running and should achieve at least a 3.0 percent 
rate in 1995, when the Czech Republic could be growing by 5.0 
percent after a positive 1994 rate of 2.0 percent. 
  Hungary was expected to grow by a modest 1.0 percent this 
year, rising to 2.0 percent in 1995, while "zero growth" rather 
than continued contraction was expected for 1994 in the Slovak 
Republic, Bulgaria and Romania. 
  In the latter two countries, however, stagnation could 
continue in 1995, the OECD said in its semi-annual Economic 
Outlook. 
  However, it said, in addition to Poland, with 1993 GDP 
growth 
of 4.0 percent, Hungary and the Czech Republic could in reality 
have reached the "turning point" last year, when output also 
rose in Estonia and Latvia. 
  This assessment was based on the view that private sector 
activity, "likely to be growing fast" in most countries, was 
"under-recorded" throughout the area, it said. 
  A "probably substantial portion of this activity is not 
recorded in the national accounts," it said. According to some 
studies, private sector activity may now generate over 50 
percent of GDP in the region. 
  If this had been fully reflected in the accounts, the Czech 
Republic and Hungary would "probably" have shown positive growth 
last year, it said. 
  "Unrecorded activity creates more serious problems than 
statistical quirks" because "it cannot easily be taxed," the 
OECD said, adding that tax avoidance or evasion was "a principal 
reason for its growth." 
  In its review of developments in the region, the OECD said 
inflation was now generally declining in East and Central 
European countries, alhough it remained high by Western 
standards. 
  The Czech Republic had the lowest inflation level, projected 
at around 11 percent this year and 10 percent in 1995, while 
Romania, at the upper end, was expected to record rates of 170 
and 80 percent respectively. 
  The Czech Republic also had the healthiest public finances, 
with its budget in balance, while most of the countries were 
still struggling with the budgetary consequences of the 
transition from direct state control. 
  Their budget deficits remain high, ranging from 8.0 percent 
of GDP in Bulgaria and Hungary to 4.0 percent in Poland and 
Romania, and are likely to remain undder "pressure" for several 
years. 
  These problems are also reflected in the financial sector, 
marked almost everywhere by "under-capitalized banks, bad debts, 
inter-enterprise arrears and difficulties in providing finance 
for new private enterprise," the report said. 
  The OECD said exports were expected to remain "an important 
engine of growth" in the transition countries despite non-tariff 
obstacles in Western markets. 
  Their combined current account deficit is likely to widen 
this year to 9.2 billion dollars from 8.4 bn in 1993, and might 
improve slightly to last year's level in 1995.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Russian Marshal Yevgeniy </F>
Shaposhnikov by Laure Mandeville in Paris on the occasion of the 
"Eurosatory" land-based weapons fair; date not given: "Russia 
Has Made Too Many Concessions to NATO"] 
  [Text] The former Russian defense minister, who is close 
to Boris Yeltsin, is worrying about the Atlantic Alliance's 
tendency to act as the world's policeman. 
  "In signing NATO's Partnership for Peace [PfP], Russia has 
shown haste and passiveness. How can we be satisfied with the 
expansion and strengthening of the NATO military bloc when we, 
the Russians, have made concessions beyond anything that the 
international community could have imagined!" 
  In the mouth of Russian Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, on a 
stopover in Paris for the Eurosatory arms exhibition, the 
questioning of the "partnership" may seem particularly 
unexpected. This reformist officer, who made a large 
contribution to the failure of the August 1991 Communist putsch, 
is known for his fidelity to President Yeltsin. Moreover, since 
last winter, he has become his special representative within the 
powerful state company Rosvooruzheniye, responsible for the 
thorny question of Russian arms sales abroad. His "outburst" 
must therefore be taken for what it is: a polite but strong 
warning against marginalizing and humiliating Russia, a plea for 
a new collective security system. 
  "No, I have not changed, I am still in favor of cooperation 
with the West," he said smiling, when concern was expressed 
about the hardening of his stance. "What I am trying to say is 
that this cooperation has started badly, that it bears the stamp 
of an extremely dangerous imbalance." 
  The marshal explained his fears: "If you stand back a little 
from what has happened in recent years, you will understand more 
clearly the concerns of the Russian military. They have the 
impression that they have taken huge steps toward cooperation. 
But without deriving any real benefit from it. Communist 
ideology has been abandoned, the Warsaw Pact has disappeared, 
the Soviet Union has collapsed, our troops are withdrawing from 
the whole of East Europe and the Baltic countries.... And on 
the other side, what do we see? That the NATO military bloc is 
still there and that, far from disappearing, it is expanding and 
growing stronger, even aspiring to the role of [becoming the] 
armed wing of the United Nations, the world's policeman. You 
must admit that there is reason to ask questions." Yeltsin's 
opposition is doing so wholeheartedly, he stressed with some 
anxiety. "The extreme nationalists grouped under the Rutskoy 
and Zhirinovskiy banner can easily say that Russia has lost 
everything and that the West is dictating its will. For the 
average Russian, caught up in his everyday economic problems, 
these remarks produce a special response. People are becoming 
suspicious about the West's intentions." 
<H5>  Security `On One Leg' </H5>
  Marshal Shaposhnikov has not reached that stage. But he is 
worried by the emergence of a NATO bloc which, through its 
association with Russia, is complicating Russia's relations with 
its big Chinese neighbor. "Russia is Russia, it cannot blindly 
adopt the West's mechanisms, it must be able to continue to walk 
its path between Europe and Asia. Remember that it has never 
been able to accept foreign diktat for long." 
  What he rejects in the PfP is that, according to him, it 
leads to "an extremely unbalanced international scene, based on 
just one leg, one pillar." The marshal explained: "This 
monolithism is not satisfactory. It introduces a hierarchical 
organization among states, which is not acceptable. At the top, 
there is the United States which leads, then come the NATO 
member countries, then the states associated with NATO, like 
Russia or Albania, then all the others...." 
  In his opinion, it would be better to vigorously reject this 
bloc rationale and strengthen the military structures of the 
United Nations. "The mechanisms exist, they must be brought 
into play, we must create a veritable UN command for the 
peacekeeping forces," the marshal said with enthusiasm, 
brandishing the flow charts he has drawn himself: "At the 
regional level, the various existing organizations -- the CSCE, 
the CIS, ASEAN -- could, under UN control, equip themselves with 
military structures and a security council. And NATO could 
become the armed branch of the CSCE!" 
  For the time being, he admits, the Western countries are 
not ready to really call things into question. "The NATO member 
states felt that they needed to think about the future of their 
organization, now that the enemy is down. But they have not 
been capable of carrying through their reasoning. They have 
only produced the PfP. That is not enough." 
  Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov admits that he can understand them. 
"They are afraid of Russia, afraid of destabilization. They are 
not therefore in any hurry to disarm." 
  However, Russia must not be driven into a corner, there must 
not be constant attempts to weaken it. "We have reached a 
threshold beyond which, if we are forced to back down further, 
we will be driven into revanchist positions." 
<H5>  From Rwanda to Georgia </H5>
  Suddenly the marshal grew angry: "I am thinking of our 
policy within the CIS, in the Caucasus for instance. I admit 
that I was very surprised to hear some French officials accuse 
Russia of hegemonic aspirations. The intervention mission which 
we are carrying out in Georgia has been decided at the request 
of the two sides in the conflict. It must not be forgotten that 
this region has been part of Russian cultural and political 
space for centuries. We therefore have obligations over there. 
So why question our intentions? Am I expressing surprise at 
the dispatch of a French military force to Rwanda? Am I talking 
of hegemonism? And yet, the ties which bind France to that 
African country are much more tenuous than those which we have 
with Georgia!" 
  The same type of argument is behind his analysis of Russia's 
access to the international arms market. "The Russians cannot 
be prevented from having a presence on that market. Do we frown 
when the French supply Mirage planes to Taiwan. No. We 
therefore ask that nobody should express surprise when we sign a 
contract to sell MIG planes to the Malaysians." 
  "You know," he added, "I do not represent the Russian 
military-industrial complex, but I receive the directors of 
military factories every day in my office. Their economic and 
social problems are awful. They are trying to solve them... 
Our aim is not to inundate the world with our weapons but to 
find our place on the market, in accordance with the rules of 
competition." 
  In the specific sphere of the control of Russian arms sales 
by the state, the Rosvooruzheniye company has made great 
progress, according to the marshal. The Mafia structures which 
had seized control of this profitable sector at the time of the 
USSR's collapse, have been "dismantled."

  [Excerpts] Brussels, June 30 (AFP) -- The European Court of 
Justice held that the EU [European Union] Commission had 
"serious" arguments in seeking action against Greece for 
blockading Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM], the Commission said on Thursday [30 June]. [passage 
omitted] 
  Sources close to the Commission of the European Union (EU) 
on 
Wednesday had reported the Court as saying that it needed one to 
two years to see if the Greek embargo violated EU regulations. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Court decided that it was unable to decide whether or 
not 
the embargo by Greece contravened treaties of the European Union 
(EU), which do not allow EU members to take such unilateral 
action on trade, until it had studied the matter in detail. 
  But the Court held that the arguments advanced by the 
Commission appeared to be "pertinent and serious," a spokesman 
for the Commission said on Thursday. 
  "The Court believes that the unilateral measures taken by 
Greece are in contradiction with community regulations 
concerning the free circulation of goods and the common trade 
policy," the spokesman said. 
  But the Court had said on Wednesday that it was rejecting 
the 
request that temporary measures be taken because the Commission 
had not shown that serious and irreperable prejudice had been 
caused, the Commission spokesman said. 
  However the Court had found that the Commission's legal 
arguments about the fundamental issues had appeared at first 
sight to be pertinent and serious. 
  This ruling, which had been given behind closed doors to 
Greece and the Commission, did not prejudice the final decision 
of the Court. [passage omitted]
