  [Text] The author of this article is an assistant 
professor at the CPC Central Committee Party School who uses a 
pen name for reasons that may be inferred. This article makes a 
rather brief, complete, and factual exposition of the social and 
political situation on the China mainland. The models for 
forecasting the post-Deng political situation are also 
scientific and fresh. They provide a rare analysis from within 
the CPC for the discussion of the post-Deng political situation 
that follows. 
  When people speculate about whether the Chinese political 
situation will become chaotic once Deng Xiaoping passes away, I 
first define "chaotic" as social and political disorder 
resulting from the intensification and eruption of various 
social and political contradictions when cohesiveness is lost. 
<H5>  Three Great Change Factors That Will Determine the Future </H5>
Political Situation 
  It is apparent from this definition that there are three 
main 
variables that will determine whether the political situation in 
China becomes chaotic once Deng Xiaoping passes away. The first 
is the socio-political contradictions (the kind and the 
intensity) that accumulate while Deng is still alive; the second 
is the degree of cohesiveness and the possibilities for 
cohesiveness within the party when Deng passes away; and the 
third is economic factors. The correlation among these three 
variables is as follows: 1) The correlation between 
socio-political contradictions and institutional cohesiveness 
is: the higher the degree of cohesiveness within the system, the 
more easily social and political contradictions outside the 
system can be surmounted. Conversely, the lower the degree of 
cohesiveness within the system, the less easily social and 
political contradictions outside the system can be surmounted. 
2) The correlation between the economic situation and 
institutional cohesiveness is as follows: the better the 
economic situation, the more easily cohesiveness can be 
achieved. Conversely, the worse the economic situation, the more 
difficult the achievement of cohesiveness. 3) The correlation 
between the economic situation and social contradictions is as 
follows: the better the economic situation, the fewer the 
contradictions, meaning that even though contradictions may 
exist, they will not easily intensify. Conversely, the more 
readily contradictions may arise and be difficult to surmount. 
  This article analyzes the three variables that will 
determine 
the Chinese political situation after Deng passes away, and it 
arranges them to form eight models that show eight possible 
scenarios that may unfold. 
<H5>  Vermin Who Become Wealthy Overnight Intensify Social </H5>
Contradictions 
  1. Socio-political contradictions 
  The first important variable determining China's political 
future is the social and political contradictions that have 
piled up by the time Deng passes away. So-called social 
contradictions means the contradictions between unorganized 
social forces, such as contradictions between peasants and 
urbanites, and contradictions between working people and corrupt 
officials or profiteering parvenu merchants. These 
contradictions usually stem from unfair distribution or other 
inequities or injustices. They are rooted in the distribution 
crisis, which is one of the five kinds of political crises that 
a society in transition must go through according to the 
American Comparative Government Committee (The five are 
administrative crisis, participation crisis, legitimacy crisis, 
identity crisis, and distribution crisis). By so-called 
political contradictions is meant contradictions among organized 
political forces (or semi-organized political forces such as 
social movements). Contradictions among organized political 
forces include contradictions between civil rights forces and 
the CPC, as well as contradictions between ethnic separatist 
forces and the government. The former example is a manifestation 
of the participation crisis; the latter is a manifestation of 
the identity crisis. 
  Since 1984, the contradictions between ordinary and wage and 
salary workers and corrupt officials and profiteering parvenu 
merchants have become more and more serious. If one acknowledges 
that prior to 1989 corrupt officials gobbled up the property 
belonging to the whole people through graft, bribe taking, 
diversion of public funds for private use, and taking trips at 
public expense, then the situation during the past several years 
has reached open looting proportions. The contract operating 
system, development of the joint stock system, and the formation 
of enterprise partnerships and mergers all provide corrupt 
officials opportunities to embezzle state-owned assets. Some of 
them misappropriate state-owned and collectively owned assets by 
colluding with accounting offices, auditing agencies, and notary 
organizations to arrange false evaluations, false audits, and 
false notarizations. Some misappropriate, illegally divert, or 
swindle state or collectively owned property in the name of 
contracting. Others insert themselves as middlemen in commercial 
and trade activities to get a share of profits that should go to 
state-owned or collective enterprises. Still others abuse their 
official position to make a profit, gaining equity rights 
without paying for them in the course of share system reform, 
share listing, and share trading. Some enter into collusion all 
around, arrange under-the-counter deals, practice bribery and 
get kickbacks for facilitating loans, helping get licenses, 
assisting with court cases, assisting press operation, assisting 
household registration, and helping handle title deeds. Some 
resort to falsification of exports to cheat on tax rebates. Some 
abuse their authority to set up private companies abroad, or 
engage in off-the-books operations inside China, falsely using 
the name of a unit operating abroad or a foreign firm to make 
illegal profits... The methods are unusual and varied. 
  A November 1993 Central Television Broadcasting Station news 
report said that 200 billion yuan worth of state-owned assets 
had been lost somehow. Some experts estimate that the amount 
should have been no less than 300 billion. Where did these 
assets go? The fact is they flowed through the hands of corrupt 
officials into their own, or their children's and relative's, 
pockets. These tremendous assets make them China's new 
bourgeoisie in fact as well as in name. While these vermin are 
getting rich overnight, or carousing around, betting huge sums 
on the roll of the dice, being social butterflies, or throwing 
stock markets and exchange markets into turmoil, how many 
peasants can get only an IOU for the grain and cotton they sell 
the state! How many children cannot attend school because they 
are unable to afford 300 yuan for books! And how many 
intellectuals, working masses, retired and separated cadres and 
workers who have just a few hundred yuan in wages or pension 
bemoan the steady rise in prices. 
  The dissatisfaction of the masses toward corrupt officials 
and rich merchants and tycoons is bound to translate into 
dissatisfaction with the CPC and the government because, in a 
certain sense, this state of affairs might be said to be 
directly or indirectly attributable to certain CPC distribution 
policies or government's feeble withholding capabilities. What 
is more, when the rural price index exceeds the city price index 
for the first time, the peasants will want to go after the 
government about the various kinds of taxes, assessments and 
fines levied in the name of the law. No wonder that during a 
visit to a certain county in Hunan Province, when Jiang Zemin 
asked a peasant what he needed most, the reply he received was, 
"What I need most is Chen Sheng and Wu Guang." 
  Once social contradictions intensify, they generate a large 
scale popular reaction that is bound to create a revolutionary 
situation. Whether this revolution is benign (constructive) or 
malignant (purely destructive) depends on whether at the time 
the revolution occurs a political organization can be formed 
that is sensible and that is guided by reform and modernization. 
<H5>  The CPC Has Itself Created a Huge Opposition Faction </H5>
  The conflict between the civil rights movement and the CPC 
has gone on for 15 years since 1979. If one says that the CPC 
has been unable to bring corrupt officials to heel, it has also 
never been soft on the civil rights movement, not to mention 
that since thousands of resisters have been cruelly butchered or 
jailed since 4 June 1989. Who knows how many civil rights 
movement personnel were jailed in 1989 alone? 
  Since Wei Jingsheng was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 
1979, virtually no one who founded a civilian publication or 
held a responsible position in one has escaped misfortune. In 
1981 alone, the following people were sentenced to prison or 
labor reform: In Beijing, Xu Wenli [1776 2429 4539] and Chen 
Erjin [7115 1422 2516] of SIWU LUNTAN [JUNE 4TH FORUM], to 15 
and 12 years respectively; in Guangzhou, Wang Xizhe [3769 1585 
0772] and Xu Yongliang [1776 3055 5328] of XUEXI TONGXIN [STUDY 
COMMUNICATIONS], to 14 and 10 years respectively; in Guangzhou 
again He Qiu [0149 3061] of RENMIN ZHI LU [THE PEOPLE'S ROAD], 
to 10 years; in Shanghai, Fu Shenqi [0265 3947 1142] of MINZHU 
ZHI SHENG [THE PEOPLE'S VOICE], seven years (Released from 
prison in 1986, he was jailed again in 1991. He was let out of 
jail in February 1991 only to be sentenced to three years labor 
reform in 1993). Sun Weibang [1327 4850 6721] of HAILANGHUA [SEA 
SPRAY] in Qingdao was sentenced to one year (Following the 4 
June incident, he was sentenced to an additional 12 years). In 
Wuhan, Qinu Yongmin [4440 3057 2404], Zhang Minpeng [1728 2404 
7720], and Zhu Jianpin [2612 0256 2430] of ZHONG SHENG [BELL 
SOUND] were sentenced to a respective eight years in prison, 
three years in labor reform, and six years in prison. In 
Hangzhou, Shen Jianmin [3088 0256 3046] of ZHI JIANG was 
sentenced to four years. In Tianjin, Tang Gedan [3282 2047 
2481], Liu Shixian [0491 1102 6343] and Lu Honghe [0712 3163 
0735] of BOHAI ZHI BIN [SHORES OF BOHAI] were sentenced 
respectively to 4 1/2 years imprisonment and three and three 
years of labor reform. In Chongqing, Liang Junxi [2733 0193 
6007] of GONGMIN BAO [CITIZENS NEWS] was sentenced to an unknown 
number of years imprisonment. In Anyang, Liu Eran [0491 0059 
1344] of MINZHU ZHUAN [DEMOCRATIC BRICKS] was sentenced to one 
year. 
  Even those members of the civil rights movement who were not 
sentenced to jail have been treated with prejudice. An example 
is Hu Ping [5170 1627], the editor-in-chief of the former WOTU 
[FERTILE EARTH], who was stripped of his masters degree and not 
assigned to a job for two years. Following graduation from 
university, poet Bei Ling [6296 1545], a member of the editorial 
committee of the first issue of the former ZHONGGUO RENQUAN 
[CHINESE HUMAN RIGHTS], was deprived of his right to work for 
two years following graduation. 
  Following Deng's remarks during his travels in south 
China, the mainland civil rights movement once again became 
sctive, and tended toward reasonableness. Its "Peace 
Constitution" expressed support for CPC reforms and called for 
social reconciliation. 
  Thanks to the campaign to eradicate spiritual pollution of 
1983, the anti-bourgeoisie liberalization campaigns of 1981 and 
1987, and the large scale massacre, large scale arrests, and 
large scale purges of 1989, the CPC created with its own hands 
an enormous opposition faction. This opposition faction includes 
not only the activists of the Democracy Wall and election 
campaign period, but also those who supported Hu Yaobang's 
"Lilun Wuxu Faction" [3810 6158 0523 5711 3175] (people such as 
Yan Jiaqi [0917 1367 0366], Zhang Xianyang [1728 7359 2254], Su 
Shaozhi [5685 4801 2535], Yu Haocheng [0060 3185 2052], Yu 
Guangyuan [0060 0342 6678], Hu Jiwei [5170, 4958 0251], Wang 
Ruoshui [3769 5387 3055], Wang Ruowang [3769 5387 2598], Xu 
Liangying [6079 5328 5391], Li Honglin [2621 3163 2651], Li Shu 
[7812 3412], Guo Luoji [6753 5012 1015], Wu Mingyu [0702 2429 
3842], Ge Yang [2047 2254], Ruan Ming [7086 6900], Sun 
Changjiang [1327 7022 3068], and Li Rui [2621 6904], plus Zhao 
Ziyang's braintrust, the members of the "three institutes and 
one association." If one says that each of these civil rights 
forces was fighting its own war prior to "June 4th," the "June 
4th" repression made them unite and set up a "civil rights 
association front" overseas. 
  The civil rights movement in China is fairly quiet today 
because of severe repression and strict control, but it does not 
lack a small number of courageous people who have established an 
underground organization to carry on resistance activities. 
Examples include the "Chinese Freedom and Democracy Party," the 
Chinese Free Trade Union Preparatory Committee," and the "China 
Progressive League," which the Chinese Communists apprehended in 
1991. They were preparing to use a model airplane to scatter 
leaflets over Tiananmen Square on 4 June that year calling on 
the people not to forget "June 4th." When the incident came to 
light, scores of people were arrested, 16 of them in Beijing 
including Hu Shigen [5170 4258 2704], Kang Yuchun [1660 3768 
2504], Wang Guozhai [3769 0948 7872], Lu Zhigang [7120 2535 
0474], Liu Jingsheng [0491 0079 3932], Gao Yuxiang [7559 3768 
4382], Wang Tiancheng [3769 0160 1813], Wang Peizhong [37690150 
1813], Chen Qinglin [7115 7230 2651], Chen Wei [7115 5898], 
Zhang Chunzhu [1728 4783 2612], Rui Chaohuai [5360 2600 2037], 
Xing Hongwei [6717 1347 0251], Li Quanli [2621 0356 0448], Xu 
Dongling [6079 2639 1545], and Zhang Guojun [1728 0948 6874]. 
  In June 1992, Wang Shengli [3769 0524 0448] and Liao Jian 
[1675 0679 1344], Chinese People's University students, were 
arrested by the CPC for "counterrevolutionary propaganda 
instigation" because they had organized a student's society 
called "Book Reading Society" and published a magazine titled 
DAJIA [EVERYBODY]. 
  Following Deng Xiaoping's remarks during this travels in 
south China, the civil rights movement became active on the 
mainland once again, but tended toward reasonableness. The 
"Peace Constitution" issued by nine people including Qin Yongmin 
[the editor of the former Wuhan magazine, ZHONG SHENG, and Yang 
Zhou [2799 0719] expressed this trend. While calling upon the 
CPC to release political criminals, abolish counterrevolution as 
a crime, and accelerate political system reform, this 
constitution also called for peaceful reform. In this regard, it 
expressed support for the CPC-led reforms, and called for social 
reconciliation. The Chinese Communists response to this moderate 
manifesto was to arrest Qin and Yang. This action was tantamount 
to refusing to join hands with the civil rights movement on 
reform for a peaceful transition to a modern society. It also 
stifled the possibility of a benign revolution and avoidance of 
the prospect of a destructive, malignant revolution should a 
reckless and large scale popular uprising occur. 
<H5>  News of Bloody Clashes in Southern Xinjiang and in Lhasa </H5>
  The contradiction between the minority nationalities and the 
Han nationality is not just a social contradiction. In Xinjiang, 
Inner Mongolia, and Tibet, it has become a political 
contradiction as well. For many years, organized ethnic 
separatists have fought for the independence of Xinjiang and 
Xinjiang. Their political goal is the establishment of a 
Turkestan and Turpan republic. Despite the strict news blockade, 
one still hears about bloody clashes in southern Xinjiang and 
Lhasa. The 22 November 1985 demonstration and presentation of a 
petition by more than 3400 Uygur students from all Beijing 
institutions of higher education opposing the government's use 
of Xinjiang as a nuclear weapons test range, and as a place for 
the banishment of criminals is well known. 
  The intense ethnic conflicts and bloody clashes in Inner 
Mongolia are apparently not as serious as those in Xinjiang and 
Tibet; nevertheless, the Mongol hatred of the Han and their 
anti-foreign sentiment is no less than that of the Uygurs and 
the Tibetans. The source of the trouble is the purge of the 
Inner Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party [MPRP] during the 
Cultural Revolution. This party was originally a Mongolian 
anti-Japanese resistance organization, which was subsequently 
merged with the CPC. During the Cultural Revolution, acting on 
orders of the CPC Central Committee, the MPRP Central 
Committee's first secretary, chairman of the revolutionary 
committee, and commander of the military region, Teng Haiqing 
[3326 3189 3237], said that an MPRP whose goal was the merger of 
Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia still existed in Inner 
Mongolia, and that ethnic Mongolians in the CPC were members of 
this party. Thus a mammoth, pervasive, and sustained campaign of 
"ferreting out and purging" was launched. During the course of 
this campaign, 100,000 ethnic Mongolian Party cadres were 
arrested and locked up, and more than 10,000 were beaten to 
death. Most of those doing the beating were ethnic Han who used 
extremely brutal medieval torture implements, such as drilling 
holes into people's bodies with a red hot iron chopstick, or 
suspending a large iron cauldron filled with water on steel 
wires from the neck of a person being interrogated, then making 
him stand arms stretched sideward on a high bench at the end of 
a fire pit, the cauldron hanging in a roaring fire until the 
water in it reached a rolling boil and scalded the person being 
interrogated till he had no choice but to confess. Many people 
died from this torture because they refused to confess. To this 
day, whenever the term "ferret out and purge" is mentioned, 
ethnic Mongolians gnash their teeth, and when Teng Haiqing is 
mentioned, they would like to eat his flesh and skin him. 
<H5>  Three Large Chinese Communist High Level Factions </H5>
  2. Cohesiveness Within the System and Ability of the System 
To Maintain Cohesiveness When Deng Passes Away 
  The second important variable determining China's political 
future is cohesiveness within the system and the ability of the 
system to maintain cohesiveness. There are four groups whose 
cohesiveness must be maintained: all party factions, local power 
factions, civil rights forces and ethnic separatist forces, and 
various mass organizations and social forces. 
  1. All Party Factions 
  The main high level factions in the CPC today are as 
follows: 
  (A) The main line faction of which Jiang Zemin is the 
"nucleus," which is now being built and whose perimeters are as 
yet undemarcated. Since becoming CPC Committee secretary 
general, Jiang has made no contributions to ideological theory 
or to modernization plans or lines, but he has put a lot of 
effort into accumulating strength and gaining power. He knows 
very well the importance of military support. In contrast to 
Zhao Ziyang, who never concerned himself with military affairs 
when he was vice chairman of the Military Affairs Committee, 
Jiang seeks out persons in charge in all sectors of the Military 
Affairs Committee and military regions for individual chats. He 
has also transferred to Beijing his old comrade-in-arms and 
former Shanghai garrison commander Ba Zhongtan [1572 0022 6151], 
promoting him to commander-in-chief of the People's Armed 
Police. The incumbent chairman of the CPC Office, Zeng Qinghong 
[2582 1987 4767] is also a secretary who Jiang Zemin brought 
from Shanghai. In addition, CPC Propaganda Department director 
Gong Xinhan [7895 1800 3466], Chinese Social Sciences Academy 
deputy director Liu Ji [0491 0679], and RENMIN RIBAO deputy 
editor-in-chief, Zhou Ruijin [0719 3843 6855] are all people 
Jiang transferred to important posts from Shanghai. 
  This shows somewhat that he subconsciously fears a 
repetition 
of the 1976 Hua, Ye, and Wang seizure of the "gang of four." If 
one says that prior to 1992 Jiang's work emphasis was on 
opposition to the right and prevention of peaceful evolution, 
since the remarks of Deng Xiaoping during his travels in south 
China, one must admit that he has suddenly changed into a 
vanguard for reform. He is currently employing the three volumes 
of Deng's selected works as a banner for increasing cohesiveness 
in order to consolidate his own "nuclear" position in the hope 
of creating a mainline faction within the party. Whether such a 
mainline faction can be formed and its ability to achieve 
cohesiveness with other factions holds great importance for the 
future stability of the political situation. However, the most 
unfavorable factor for the formation of this mainline faction 
and its cohesiveness is Jiang himself. Possibly as long as Deng 
lives, he will be found hand and foot, but whatever the case, 
his left lining and his mediocre performance since 1989 have 
left an indelible impression in people's minds. Unless Jiang and 
his faction can do something spectacular in the days immediately 
following Deng's demise, one can imagine how weak his ability to 
achieve cohesiveness will be. 
  B. The leftist faction united around the person of Deng 
Liqun 
[6772 0500 5028]. Historically, the persistence of leftism in 
the CPC has been an extremely serious ailment. The power of the 
leftist faction is deep-rooted. Even during the decade of reform 
and opening to the outside world, the leftist faction has been 
able to organize forces to make three major comebacks in 1981, 
1983, and 1987. The power of the leftist faction increased 
greatly in the wake of "June 4th." Not only did it take the 
opportunity to settle scores with the reform faction, but it 
also took back many important powers from the central government 
to local governments, and from party affairs to the government. 
It also used the public opinion and propaganda power it held to 
instigate a constant leftist clamor, even going so far as to say 
that the seizure of the capitalist roaders during the Cultural 
Revolution was correct (a speech that Deng Liqun made 
commemorating the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the 
CPC). "The theory of continuing revolution under the 
dictatorship of the proletariat remains the touchstone for 
differentiating true and false Marxism" (State Education 
Commission document written to provide guidance to professors at 
East China Teachers College in Shanghai). It said that it is 
necessary to "seize the initiative in handling contradictions" 
anew. (An article written by Deng Liqun published in the 23 
October 1991 issue of RENMIN RIBAO). In order to seize this 
initiative, this faction is preparing to do battle with the 
reform faction after Deng passes away. It is collecting and 
collating all sorts of typical materials to criticize Deng's 
rightist errors. 
Zemin is using the three volumes of Deng's selected works 
as a banner to increase conformity and consolidate his own 
"nuclear" position in the hope of shaping a future mainstream 
faction within the party. 
  C. The reform faction. The people generally regarded as 
comprising the reform faction include incumbent Politburo 
members Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, and Tian Jiyun, former 
Politburo members Zhao Ziyang, Wan Li, and Hu Qili, and former 
Secretariat secretaries Zhu Houze, Yan Mingfu, and Rui Xingwen. 
Their reform orientations are not entirely the same. For 
example, Zhao Ziyang not only advocates market-oriented economic 
reforms, but also stands for a considerable degree of opening to 
the outside world, democracy, and freedom. Some of the others 
may want to build a market economy first and then talk about 
freedom and democracy. Some only approve of a market economy, 
but basically do not agree with espousing freedom and democracy. 
These differences mean that although the CPC high level reform 
faction can maintain unanimity in the face of leftwing faction 
attacks on reform and opening to the outside world, it may split 
on political reform issues. Reportedly, Zhao Ziyang and others 
are pondering the problem of how to redress the June 4th events. 
Once Deng passes away, the NPC and the CPPCC, which Qiao Shi, 
Tian Jiyun, and Li Ruihuan head may become bases for 
consolidating the reform faction and for pushing ahead with 
reform and opposition to the counterattacks of the leftist 
faction. 
<H5>  Three Main Ways of Gaining Cohesiveness Within the CPC </H5>
  Once Deng dies, no matter whether the leftist faction first 
rises in revolt or whether the reform faction, which advocates 
political reform, rises in revolt, a clash between the two 
factions will surely be difficult to avoid. What role elder 
statesmen like Chen Yun and Bo Yibo will play in this clash at 
that time is also difficult to estimate. Generally speaking the 
tactics that the CPC has used to produce conformity within the 
party have been the leaders (personal charisma), the system, and 
ideology. When Mao Zedong was alive, all three of these 
methods played a role; consequently, cohesiveness within the 
party was extremely high at that time. Since the advent of 
reform and opening to the outside world, a unified ideology has 
become virtually useless in achieving cohesiveness, and the 
system cohesiveness that Deng has always hoped to build has yet 
to be realized. Thus, all that is left is the cohesiveness that 
the leaders individually can bring. Even during Deng's lifetime, 
his record, ability, and charisma could not bring cohesiveness 
within the party. (During "June 4th," Deng's personal ability to 
bring cohesiveness was also in danger; he could maintain his 
authority only by relying on military force, and it was not 
until after his remarks during the visit to south China that his 
charisma and legitimacy revived). Once Deng dies, there will be 
no one having a record (Jiang became a party member only in 
1947). Furthermore, once Jiang, who lacks ability and charisma, 
has lost the means to use ideology and the system, will he be 
able to harmonize and reconcile clashes within the party? 
<H5>  Local Power Faction Too Cumbersome To Be Effective </H5>
  2. The Local Power Faction 
  Thanks to the delegation of legislative authority, authority 
over the assignment of people, and fiscal authority during the 
past decade, local governments' power and financial resources 
have increased greatly. It is on this foundation that local 
power factions that are too cumbersome to be effective have 
taken shape. In recent years, some local legislation has dared 
to defy central government legislation. When central government 
policies and directives reach local governments, they are either 
not implemented or their emphasis or flavor is changed. Zhu 
Rongji's macroeconomic regulation and control (the 16 articles), 
of June 1993 aimed at getting rid of "local princelings" policy 
making, but the abortion of this effort was announced after just 
three months, thereby showing that the central government is 
unable to impose cohesiveness in the face of local power 
factions opposition. 
  Ever since institution of the system of dividing revenues 
and 
expenditures between the central government and local 
governments and holding each responsible for balancing its own 
budget in 1980, the central government's financial resources 
have fallen seriously. The state's percentage of fiscal revenues 
declined from 31.2 percent in 1978 to 14.7 percent in 1992. 
During the Seventh 5-Year Plan (1986-1990), the ratio between 
central government fiscal revenues and local government fiscal 
revenues declined further to 40:60. If unbudgeted funds are 
figured into fiscal revenues, the central government's fiscal 
revenues amount to only one-fifth of total revenues. In some 
western countries, coordination of the relationship between the 
central government and local governments depends largely on some 
effective institutions such as Congress or the Bundesrat. In 
China, the central government's main instruments for bringing 
local governments into line are fiscal authority and the 
authority to allocate resources. When the central government 
regularly has to beg from local governments to get by, one can 
imagine how much power it has to bring local governments into 
line. 
  Another example that reflects the increase in strength of 
local power factions versus the central government is the 
increase in the number of local representatives in the 
Politburo: Before 1982, not a single one of the 12th Party 
Central Committee's 28 Politburo members and candidate members 
was a local cadre. In the 1987 13th Party Central 
Committee-created Politburo, four of the 18 members and 
candidate members were local representatives; and in the 
Politburo that the 14th Party Central Committee produced in 
1992, six of the 22 members and candidate members were local 
representatives. 
  In order to increase the central government' financial 
resources as a means of keeping local governments in line, the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee 
decided to institute a tax division system beginning in 1994, 
the central feature of which was readjustment of the taxation 
structure. Customs duties, bank financing insurance taxes, and 
income taxes paid by post and telecommunications and railroad 
enterprises would be given to the central government, and income 
taxes from ordinary enterprises would be given to local 
governments. At the same time, the Bureau of Taxation would be 
divided into a central government bureau and a local government 
bureau, each of them collecting its own kinds of taxes. This 
measure was designed to ensure the central government's fiscal 
revenues. Had it been possible to institute these measures, they 
would truly have increased the central government's authority; 
however, the central government's existing authority had to be 
relied on to put these measures into effect. This gave rise to a 
contrary theory. Reportedly, a report from the Chinese Academy 
of Social Sciences warned the Central Committee: Institution of 
a tax division system in China in 1994 would produce social 
instability.

  3. Civil Rights Forces and Ethnic Separatist Forces 
  In order to enforce cohesiveness, a political system has to 
be able to incorporate newly emerging social forces and 
political groups into its own system as they appear. This means 
that institutionalized channels for participation must be set 
up. In modern political science terms, this denotes 
institutional expansion and development of the ruling party's 
power. However, the Chinese Communists promote a 
self-contradictory policy. During the past 10 years, they have 
steadily promoted a splitting up of the social and political 
structure (a structural split is bound to create a pluralization 
of social interests and a pluralization of social groups); 
however, they have refused and restricted the demands for 
government participation of the newly emerging social and 
political forces that splitting of the structure generates. A 
steadily increasing participation crisis has been the result. 
Moreover, when a participation crisis occurs, the CPC not only 
does not readjust its own policies but uses force to repress it. 
Thus, not only are the contradictions not resolved, but they 
steadily intensify and accumulate. Chinese Communist political 
thinking has always maintained that the urban society and that 
society's representatives -- the civil rights forces -- brought 
about by the split are antagonistic forces (when actually this 
is not necessarily so; the civil rights organization could play 
a role within the system of a loyal opposition), and that the 
spontaneous participation of civil rights groups is "causing 
trouble." 
  The Chinese Communists also believe that dialogue and other 
forms of equality are something that the civil rights forces may 
not enjoy. They can only use force to wipe out the civil rights 
movement. However, the fact is that force has not been able to 
wipe out the civil rights movement. During the past 10 years the 
civil rights movement has developed and grown stronger. It 
became so strong that the Chinese Communists had to use 
conventional forces and tanks to deal with it. However, history 
has shown that armed forces positively are not a willing 
suppressor. Deng is the only person who can use the armed forces 
against their own will. Once Deng is gone, should another civil 
rights movement storm arise, will Jiang Zemin, in his capacity 
as chairman of the Central Military Affairs Committee, be able 
to for the armed forces to aim their muzzles on the public? 
Might not the armed forces split when faced with such an order? 
<H5>  Chinese Communist Organizational System Lax and </H5>
Disintegrating 
  4. All Kinds of Mass Organizations and Social Forces 
  Aside from the methods cited above for enforcing social 
cohesiveness, namely charismatic leaders, Marxist-Leninist and 
Mao Zedong Though ideology, and force, the Chinese Communists 
must rely largely on strict party organization and a pervasive 
organizational system from top to bottom. In the rural villages, 
this is communes; in cities, it is "units." 
  Some people believe that China has no society, just "units." 
This is because society is within "units." Every commune and 
"unit" is a small society. This analysis makes very good sense. 
Since communes and "units" perform social security and social 
supervision functions, they play a role in social cohesiveness. 
However, following reform and opening to the outside world, the 
separation of government administration and social management, 
and the separation of government administration and enterprise 
management has enabled society to begin to separate from the 
state. Development of a market economy will further accelerate 
this trend; thus, society will develop in the direction of a 
pluralization of interests, and a pluralization of blocs. 
Simultaneous with the trend toward disintegration of the 
communes and "units" that formerly enforced social cohesiveness, 
new social organizations able to take over the communes' and 
"units'" cohesiveness functions, namely mass organizations, will 
be in a state of either no healthy development or atrophy (like 
after "June 4th"] owing to strict Chinese Communist restrictions 
(the need to have approval from and be controlled by a higher 
level administrative authority and a civil government 
department). Thus, full and correct expression and coordination 
of social interests will be difficult. The weakness of social 
self-rule and the ability of self-rule organizations, as well as 
the current increase in the crime rate and the chaotic state of 
social order foreshadow future social unrest. 
<H5>  Ordinary People's Income and Prices Cause Popular Revolt </H5>
  3. Economic Situation 
  The third major variable determining China's political 
future 
is the state of the economy when Deng dies. How well the economy 
does is not only the foundation for the legitimacy of the 
Chinese Communist's role, but also directly affects the degree 
of cohesiveness within the system, and the intensity of social 
contradictions and social conflicts. Many political crises stem 
from economic crisis. One need look no farther for examples than 
the 1988 collapse of the effort to battle down prices, which led 
to major central government personnel and policy readjustments, 
and the campus unrest of 1989. The Chinese Communist's reason 
for doling out huge amounts of money since 1989 to subsidize the 
losses of state-owned enterprises in violation of market laws is 
fear of an economic decline (depression) that might bring about 
civil unrest. 
  When we regard the economic system as a variable affecting 
China's political future, our focus is mostly on superficial 
factors such as income and prices that can cause public anguish 
and a sense of frustration, and only secondarily on policy 
issues such as the speed, or the regulation and control of 
development and reform that can cause splits within the party. 
<H5>  2. Eight Political Situation Prospects After Deng </H5>
  Eight models can be derived by grouping the foregoing three 
variables that will determine government in China after Deng. 
These eight models show eight possible scenarios for the Chinese 
political situation after Deng dies. (See table). However, they 
are all only starting points for changes in ;the Chinese 
government after Deng; they are not the final results.

<H5>  Ideal Political, Economic, and Social Outlook, After Deng </H5>
<H5>  The key variable among the three variables affecting the </H5>
future is the degree of cohesiveness among the top echelons of 
the CPC. If the CPC dares to carry out political reform, China's 
outlook will be extremely optimistic. 
  Model 1 (1+3+5): Stable Model 
  Sustained and consistent growth of the industrial and 
agricultural economy, with more rational readjustments of the 
industrial structure accompanying economic growth; more 
pervasive reform of the economic system; establishment of a 
market system; formation within the CPC of a mainstream faction 
in which Jiang Zemin is the nucleus, and whose authority is 
stable, with Jiang continuing Deng's line of reform and opening 
to the outside world, and receiving major support from within 
the party. Despite clashes between left and right wing factions, 
the general welfare is not impaired; the armed forces are 
stable, and they continue to play a role in backstopping reform 
and opening to the outside world. Smooth implementation of the 
tax division system increases the cohesiveness of the central 
government, and localism is curbed. Despite the existence and 
frequent occurrence of socio-political contradictions, and 
although they produce large scale social tumult, they pose no 
threat to Chinese Communist rule. Agriculture's increased output 
and the increased income it provides, a rise in prices paid the 
peasants for grain and cotton, and payment of money [rather than 
IOUs] for grain purchases permits the peasants to maintain their 
income at the level of previous years or increase it. The 
development of township and town enterprises absorbs large 
amounts of surplus agricultural manpower, thereby reducing 
pressures on the cities from drifters. Growth of industry and 
price stability or a rise in the income of urbanites that excess 
the degree of rise in prices calms urban sentiment. Crackdowns 
on graft and corruption promote social justice, thereby 
increasing the legitimacy of the regime. All these events play a 
role in stabilizing society. Although a small number of civil 
rights groups and civil rights movement people constantly call 
for the release of political prisoners in order to redress "June 
4th" and quicken political reform, not only is this difficult to 
do on a very large scale while the CPC is in process of changing 
from force to a policy of limited opening up, but it might lead 
to the development of an opposition faction within the system. 
  All the foregoing is an ideal social, economic, and 
political 
scenario after Deng passes away. However, realization of this 
scenario will depend, first of all, on how many more years Deng 
lives so that his authority may be relied upon for completion of 
the building of a market economy to enable Jiang Zemin to 
fashion a mainstream faction, and to be able to bring the armed 
forces and local governments in line. Second, it depends on 
Jiang Zemin's policy innovations such as continuing reform and 
opening to the outside world, not yielding to or compromising 
with the leftists, cracking down severely on graft and 
corruption, accepting modern political concepts, gradually 
opening the way for democracy, and bringing opposition factions 
outside the system into the system as an opposition faction. 
Third, it depends on the favor of heaven to bring in continuous 
bumper harvests. 
  Since these objective conditions are not likely to be in 
being at the same time, the prospects for model 1 are not great. 
<H5>  A Transition to Stability or Turmoil </H5>
  Model 2 (1+2+3): Model for a Transition to Turmoil. 
  Jiang Zemin's mainstream has taken shape and his power has 
been consolidated. Within the party, a strong consensus exists, 
the degree of cohesiveness is high, and the CPC's cohesiveness 
with local governments, the central government, and society is 
very strong. The good economic situation has further enhanced 
the legitimacy of the CPC regime, and it has improved unity 
within the party and within the armed forces, and between the 
CPC and local governments. Despite severe social contradictions 
and CPC clashes with forces outside the systems, these are of 
short duration. Unrest is quelled very quickly. The civil rights 
movement is either suppressed or brought within the system. 
  Model 3. (3+4+5): Model for A Transition to Turmoil. 
  Economic growth continues; the people's livelihood is 
relatively stable; and contradictions between society and 
government are not severe. However, Jiang Zemin's mainstream 
faction and the cohesiveness of all factions in the party could 
not be achieved while Deng was alive. Jiang's authority fails of 
recognition. Temporary stability cannot last for long. Clashes 
may erupt at any time among factions within the party, between 
the central government and local governments, and between the 
CPC and forces outside the system. Model 3 is a short-lived 
transitional stage. 
  Model 4 (1+5+6): Model for a Transition to Stability. 
  A mainstream faction has taken shape within the party; Jiang 
Zemin's authority has been consolidated. Cohesiveness within the 
party is fairly high, and the system is quite cohesive. Although 
conflicts between society and the government occur at times, 
they pose no threat to the system. Despite some problems in the 
economy, the CPC and the government have the will and the time 
to solve them to realize the model 1 scenario. This situation 
does not rule out two other possibilities, namely a worsening of 
the economic situation as a result of policy mistakes, social 
turmoil occurring as a result, or intensification of political 
contradictions with forces outside the system, the country 
ending up with the model 5 scenario. If economic factors and 
socio-political contradictions cause further clashes within the 
party, the CPC will lose its existing cohesiveness advantage. 
The state will sink into a tumultuous model 7 scenario to face a 
revolutionary situation. 
<H5>  Benign or Malignant Revolution </H5>
  Model 5 (1+2+6): Clash and Confrontation Model 
  A mainstream faction has taken shape in the party; Jiang 
Zemin's authority has been consolidated; cohesiveness within the 
party is high; and cohesiveness with forces outside the system 
is also fairly strong. The economy has regressed; agriculture 
has atrophied; industrial concerns are operating under capacity 
creating an increase in the number of drifters and the 
unemployed; income has decreased; there is inflation and prices 
have soared; and the renminbi has been devalued provoking cries 
of discontent all around. Collapse of the stock market causes 
stock market turmoil. Popular revolts break out; and the civil 
rights movement surges. The CPC and its system face a strong 
challenge from social and civil rights forces. This 
confrontation may last for a fairly long time, and may lead to a 
split within the party. Two outcomes are possible: Either the 
party's reform faction seizes control and reaches an agreement 
with the civil rights movement, China thereby taking a political 
reform road, or the party's conservative faction comes to power 
and uses force to put down the civil rights movement and 
uprisings, China regressing to a sealed off and conservative 
state. No matter which occurs, the attitude of the armed forces 
will be decisive. 
  Model 6 (2+3+4): Benign Revolution Model 
  The economy continues to grow with no large scale outbreaks 
or reckless and destructive uprisings. Within the party, 
cohesiveness is low, and the system's ability to bring 
cohesiveness is poor. Factional fights and power struggles 
within the party are intense. Local "princelings" have much 
strength; and graft and corruption are serious. The public makes 
a huge outcry as centrifugal forces in the party grow. At the 
same time, another surge occurs in the civil rights movement, 
which is becoming organized and cohesive. This scenario is a 
benign revolution scenario whose most likely outcome is a link 
up between the reform faction within the party and the civil 
rights forces to bring down the conservatives and gain power to 
put China on a democratic reform path. 
  Model 7 (2+4+6) A revolutionary model (in which the outlook, 
whether benign or malignant, is uncertain) 
  Both cohesiveness within the system and the system's ability 
to bring cohesion are very weak. Contradictions between society 
and government are very grave. This turn of events is 
strengthened by deterioration of the economy. Consequently, 
China faces a revolutionary situation. The key element at this 
time is the degree of organization of the reform forces (the 
reform faction within the party and the civil rights forces). 
Whether the revolution will be benign or malignant will depend 
on this. 
  Model 8 (4+5+6) A revolutionary transitional model. 
  In this scenario, both the government and society are very 
weak. Factions within the party overlap and fight for power. 
Local "princelings" are very strong; "independent kingdoms" 
exist. The economy is in depression. Clashes between society and 
the government are quiescent, but this scenario cannot last for 
long, because deterioration of the economy is bound to intensify 
social conflicts. Splits within the party also provide 
development opportunities for the civil rights movement, the 
prospects for which may be those given in model 7. 
<H5>  The Key Lies in the Cohesiveness of the CPC Upper Echelon </H5>
  The foregoing eight models show that the key variable of the 
three major variables affecting China's future political outlook 
is the degree of cohesiveness of the upper echelon of the CPC. 
To a very large extent, the extent to which other conflicts may 
intensify and produce a crisis depends on whether a compromise 
may be reached among the contending factions within the CPC to 
produce a consensus and produce cohesion. If clashes do not 
intensify between the ultra-leftist faction and the reform 
faction within the party, and if the upper echelon of the CPC 
does not split, the local "princelings" will find it difficult 
to grow in power, and ethnic separatism will not succeed. In 
that case, even if an economic crisis occurs, it can be handled; 
and should uprisings occur, they can be very quickly quelled. 
  Everyone remembers that the Democracy Wall movement of 1979 
developed out of a crevice in the struggle between the reform 
faction and the whatever faction. The campus unrest of 1989 also 
developed into a nationwide democratic movement against a 
background of struggle between Zhao Ziyang and Li Peng. If the 
CPC mainstream faction can produce policy innovations at the 
same time that a high degree of cohesiveness exists within the 
system, not only will there be economic development in the midst 
of stability but political system reforms can also be ventured 
while controlling the situation. Thus, party factions can 
operate within the law; fights within the party can play out 
within the rules, the armed forces can become nationalized, and 
the government structure can be federalized. Thus, the NPC and 
the CPPCC will be able to play a greater role in supervising the 
government and political life, establishing a senate-like 
structure to coordinate the interests of the central government 
and local governments, and the interests of one local government 
and another. Then, prohibitions on speech, the press, and party 
can be gradually removed, and non-violent civil rights movements 
can be brought within the system. In this way, organic 
cohesiveness founded on modern principles can be attained. At 
that time, China's prospects will be extremely optimistic.

<F P=106> [Article by Liu Chengxiang (0491 2052 4161) and Wu Chao </F>
(0702 6389): "Survey of National Strength---The Selection of a 
High Investment Rate in the Current Stage of Growth"] 
  [Text] The year 1993 was a year of rapid economic growth 
and was a year in which fixed asset investment greatly 
increased. According to preliminary estimates, the GDP broke the 
major 3 trillion yuan barrier. Fixed asset investments in the 
whole society broke approximately 11.5 quadrillion yuan. The 
fixed asset investment rate was about 37 percent. If we discount 
the factor that investment item prices were higher than overall 
prices and the factor of foreign firm investment, the fixed 
asset investment rate for the entire society (hereinafter the 
investment rate) still was as high as about 33 percent, 4-5 
percentage points higher than the previous year's investment 
rate. The obvious increase in the investment rate raised the 
concern of several sectors. This brings up an acute problem: 
Could two successive years of high investment rates lead to an 
overheating of the overall economy and form serous inflation and 
cause us once again to have to conduct overall improvement and 
rectification and postpone reform? Comprehensive study of the 
domestic and foreign situation could lead to this conclusion: As 
China begins to enter the period of high investment before 
economic takeoff, a high rate of investment is an inevitable 
result of the current stage of economic development. Its 
essential basis is: 
  I. Overcoming Bottlenecks Requires Added Investment 
  From 1980 to 1992, China's investment rate went from low to 
high. To counter some years in which the investment rate reached 
30-32 percent creating economic overheating and setting off 
inflation, beginning from actual experience, people arrived at 
the awareness that it is appropriate for China's investment rate 
not to exceed 30 percent. We should say that holding it within 
these limits for a very long period of time has been 
fundamentally reasonable. Looking back on a year in which an 
excessively high investment rate touched off serious economic 
problems, it was all from excessive investment in some 
government buildings and processing industries squeezing out 
normal consumer demands causing inflation in both consumption 
and investment and allocation of funds exceeding the total 
amount that could be allocated to production. After more than a 
decade of arduous efforts, the scale of China's processing 
industry production generally reached the capability of 
satisfying normal consumer demand and in certain industries it 
generally reached saturation. But possible development in fund 
[as written; basic?] industry and infrastructure did not 
correspondingly keep pace and bottlenecks in transportation, 
energy, and raw materials development restricted economic 
development and progress in reform and opening up. It is idle 
talk to speak of wanting to promote further economic growth 
without developing the infrastructure and overcoming short-term 
restrictions. Because the time limit on basic industries and 
infrastructure is long, the investment of a large amount cannot 
be put into operation in a short period of time like processing 
industries. Generally it requires five to seven years of 
development. So, to get by infrastructure barriers, it is 
necessary to go through a stage of high investment. There is not 
a second way that can be chosen. 
  II. Savings Have Clearly Rebounded, Providing Sources 
of Funding for Investment 
  Statistical data reveal that the overall savings rate for 
the 
whole society in 1980 was 35.6 percent. By 1992 it had risen to 
43.3 percent, rising nearly 8 percentage points. The ratio of 
residents' savings in the broad sense to expendable income also 
rose from 4.5 percent in 1978 to 32 percent in 1992. The 
constant increase in the savings rate has provided investment 
with a considerable source of funds. 
  Since the 1980s, changing trends in the overall consumption 
rate (including social consumption and residential consumption) 
more clearly confirm this problem. In the 1980s, the overall 
consumption rate was rather high, averaging 60 percent and 
above. After entering the 1990s, the overall consumption rate 
declined to 60 percent and below and declined from year to year. 
Contrary to this, the fixed asset investment rate for the whole 
society rose straight up. According to preliminary 1993 
calculations, the overall consumption rate declined to 55.4 
percent and the overall investment rate rose to 37.8 percent. 
  The situation described above indicates that in the next 
stage the overall consumption rate can be essentially maintained 
at about 56-58 percent. If we take out the factor for reserves 
and the balance of payments, the investment rate can be 
maintained at about 35 percent, forming a high investment rate 
stage. This also is a requirement for China's present launching 
of international competition, preserving the advantage of cheap 
labor, and maintaining a rather low consumption rate and high 
investment rate. 
  III. To Realize 1994 Economic Growth Targets, It Is 
Necessary To Maintain a High Investment Rate 
  It is forecast that 1994 will still be a year of rapid 
economic growth. According to actual inherent economic forces, 
the economic growth rate could be about 9 percent. At the same 
time, with the push of demand and the pull of costs, prices also 
will go up by about 10 percent. Calculated by the indicators 
described above, the 1994 GDP could reach about 3.65 trillion 
yuan. As regards use, because of the current stable growth of 
consumption, calculating the consumption rate at 57 percent, the 
total consumption could reach about 2.08 trillion yuan. With the 
balance of payments maintained, after its use for consumption 
and normal reserves, the GDP arranged for fixed asset investment 
should be about 1.39 trillion yuan. According to these 
calculations, an investment rate as high as 38 percent is the 
inevitable result of an overall balance. If in a definite 
production situation, the scale of fixed asset investment is 
pushed down artificially low, it will inevitably lead to serious 
overstocking and an aggravation of three sided debts, leading to 
a slide in enterprise economic efficiency and treasury 
difficulties. If fixed asset investments are forced down and we 
want to guard against large increases in reserves, either there 
will be a favorable trade balance or the rate of growth of 1994 
production will decline. But a decline in the economic growth 
rate also could forfeit the opportunity for rapid development, 
and a large increase in exports and reducing imports also is 
very difficult. So, the high investment rate is irreversible. 
This is a result produced by conditions in several sectors. 
  Because the 1993 fixed asset investment base was too large, 
even if the actual amount in 1994 remains the same as 1993, at 
current values the investment scale will reach 1.265 trillion 
yuan and the investment rate still will be as high as about 35 
percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Chen Daxiong (7115 1129 7160): "Present Improper </F>
Consumption by Some Peasants and Their Mental Attitudes"] 
  [Excerpts] Improper consumption presently observed among 
some peasants manifests itself mainly in the following ways: 
  Ostentatious and extravagant displays at marriages and 
funerals Using up the entire family savings accumulated 
over years, and even borrowing money, in order to stage big 
shows at weddings or funerals is a rather common occurrence in 
the rural areas. A questionnaire-survey of 100 peasant 
households in the rural districts of Leping City in Jiangxi 
Province revealed that generally 8,000 to 10,000 yuan are spent 
on a wedding, and on funerals money is spent as if it were 
water, and any burial will be undertaken only after consuming 
several thousand jin of grain and slaughtering one or two pigs. 
No wonder that some people say: "Today one cannot afford to 
marry, and cannot afford to die." 
  Vying with each other in generosity when it comes to 
entertaining guests or presenting gifts As found out in 
Yongxiu County in Jiangxi Province, there are presently as many 
as somewhat over 40 reasons in the rural areas for entertaining 
guests or presenting gifts, and there is an increasing rage to 
purposely ingratiate oneself into the favors of others. The 
sample investigation of 70 peasant households in Yongxiu County 
revealed that in 1993 the average per capita expenditure on 
gifts was as high as 125 yuan, which amounted to 14.7 percent of 
a peasant's cash income. In Jiangxi Province in 1992, the 
average per capita cash expenditure on gifts was 39.18 yuan, 
which amounted to 10.6 percent of the total personal cash 
consumption, an increase of 11.1 percent, compared to 1991. 
  Rampancy of feudal superstitious activities 
Alarmingly large amounts are spent on such utterly foolish items 
of consumption as building ancestral temples, compiling family 
genealogies, sculpturing Buddha statues, building earth god 
temples, burning incense and Buddha worship, engaging spirits to 
drive out evil ghosts, and fortune telling and logomancy. To get 
into the family genealogy each male has to pay 50 to 100 yuan, 
for the ancestral temple each household is assessed several 
hundred yuan, even more money has to be spent on masses for the 
souls of the deceased, a Taoist priest has to be paid somewhat 
over 150 yuan, to which must be added his food and drink, spirit 
money, candles, and firecrackers, raising the expenses to over 
1,000 yuan. It is even more absurd that in some instances a tomb 
is built before a person's death. In Lingang Village within 
Leping City, long rows of tombs line both sides of the highway, 
all built with concrete tops and marble tablets, at an 
expenditure of altogether over 3,000 yuan. 
  Houses are built in a grandiose way If the 
peasants have money to do so, one cannot reproach them for 
wanting to improve their housing conditions. The problem is only 
that some peasants are in too much of a hurry to build houses 
just as soon as their living conditions have improved, or they 
take on new debts even before old debts had been repaid. Some 
blindly strive for a higher status and expend on a consumption 
for which they are not yet ready. 
  Some peasants go very much the wrong way in their 
consumption 
and are thereby the cause of huge economic wastage. On the other 
hand, they show themselves extremely stingy when it comes to 
spending on what is necessary, rational, and beneficial. For 
instance, they are seldom ready to spend money, and particularly 
larger sums of money, on such activities as intellectual 
investments, reproductive input, the development of public 
welfare enterprises, and on the development of new things useful 
to improve their livelihood or economic condition. 
  Analyzing how some peasants get to these improper ways of 
consumption, we find that they are mainly motivated by the 
following mental attitudes: 
  Ostentation of wealth and hedonistic attitude Some 
people believe that as long as one lives in this world one might 
as well live more comfortably and dignifiedly. On certain 
special occasions they will therefore invite in all their 
relatives, friends, and neighbors and on other occasions show 
themselves generous in sending gifts. They will take these 
opportunities to show off their wealth, go in for ostentation 
and extravagance, vie with each other in style, and all this to 
gain a certain amount of "face." 
  Feeling obliged to reciprocate Having been invited 
or received gifts, one always feels under social obligation to 
the other parties, therefore at a suitable opportunity will have 
to also feast them or send gifts to reciprocate. 
  The compensation mentality The idea: We all 
contributed our share when someone else was in need, now that an 
opportune moment has come for us, we also want those other 
parties return the favors, so that we will get back what we had 
laid out for them. 
  The "self-enrichment mentality" People who have 
this mentality will purposely leak out information about certain 
events in their families and make them evident to as large an 
audience as possible. 
  The "cannot-help-it" mentality Being compelled by 
public opinion and pressured by circumstances. Having been 
feasted and having received presents, how can one pretend to be 
deaf and dumb? One simply has no alternative but to do something 
about it. When it comes to extravagant outlays for ancestor 
worship or superstitious activities, people are afraid to be 
called disrespectful of their ancestors, and even more afraid 
that their names will be struck from the "clan register," if 
they don't join clan activities. 
  The "material benefits" syndrome Many peasants, 
affected by the commodity economy around them, feel that rather 
than spending money on further schooling of their children, they 
better have them leave school earlier, come home, and help earn 
money, thus getting some "material benefits" out of them. 
  Conservatism and fear of possible changes Some 
people believe after several decades of farming, relying on 
one's long-practiced skills and experiences will leave one not 
too far off. In particular, some farmers will not spend money to 
improve the soil or invest in afforestation for fear policy may 
change. They worry that one day an official letter may come 
ordering "readjustment," and "readjustment" it will have to be, 
or ordering "confiscation," and "confiscation" it will have to 
be. As the saying is, how can the arm overcome the strength of 
the thigh. 
  The "bad-conscience" syndrome Some people are very 
much afraid that if they would expend money or effort on public 
enterprises, others would get more out of it than they 
themselves. They have therefore no desire to get involved, and 
if someone would want them to contribute money or labor to 
anything labeled "public," they would be out of sight as fast as 
possible.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Junhong (3769 6511 4767): "Various Aspects </F>
of the Marriage Crisis in the Rural Areas"] 
  [Excerpts] Serious trend toward pre-legal age 
marriages A common saying in the countryside is: "The 
earlier a boy is born to you, the earlier your happiness," and 
this is also the backward viewpoint on procreation held by many 
in the countryside. As a result of this viewpoint, illegal [i.e. 
pre-legal age] marriages are like a pestilence jeopardizing the 
psychological health of young boys and girls. Statistics show 
that in 1991, somewhat over 1,200 births borne in pre-legal age 
marriages occurred in 25 villages and townships of a certain 
county, where the girls had been between the ages of 16 to 22. 
  Rich bosses acquiring "mistresses." Nowadays, we 
see more and more people in the countryside who have lots of 
money, which some, however, spend in a most improper way. They 
often take enterprise business as a pretext, but start a 
deceptive game of love, buy or rent houses in town, use money as 
"bait," set up "mistresses," and live a polygamous life. 
  Adultery by both sexes, emboldened by backing from some 
parties. A small number of married men and women lead 
dissolute lives, in complete disregard of the interests of 
family and children, and defying party discipline as well as the 
laws of the land. They give cause to one tragedy after another 
of families being broken up and lives being lost, of wives 
abandoning their families and children being dispersed. When Lu 
[0712], the female chairperson of a certain village, took up 
illicit relations with a certain Lu [7120] in the township in 
question, [here follows a story of great tragedy for all persons 
involved]. 
  Sudden increase of marriage troubles among "persons 
wielding power." A certain Wang, a party branch secretary 
in a certain village, originally has had a perfectly happy 
family life, but as he was doing so well in recent years, he 
started an "affair" with F, a girl in the same village, and 
after that had been going on for five years, he pressured his 
wife to give him a divorce, To gain his objective of a divorce 
agreement with his wife, he had to give up to her a large 
portion of his possessions. 
  Increasing tendency toward "economic marriages." 
In recent years, a "commodity-economy" consciousness has 
motivated peasants in the selection of marriage partners, and 
all family members are increasingly bent upon getting rich 
relatives. It thus happened time and again that marriages are 
based on economic considerations and motivated by prospects of 
enjoying all amenities of life. As a consequence, crises in 
family life and social problems are increasing correspondingly 
almost daily. 
  According to investigations, the fact that peasant women 
have 
married into quite prosperous families has led to a year by year 
increasing number of divorce cases. Among the prostitutes 
investigated or brought in for reeducation, those from rural 
areas by far outnumbered those from urban areas. Furthermore, 
women in the countryside in increasing, certainly not 
diminishing numbers, resenting the poverty of their families, 
will fabricate all kinds of alleged conflicts and on their own 
initiative demand divorces. There are also many married women in 
poverty-stricken families who will leave home to fraudulently 
remarry elsewhere to get into money.

<F P=106> [Article by Zheng Bufa (6774 2975 3127), Yang Deqing (2799 </F>
1795 3237), and Shao Jingan (6730 6855 3227): "Characteristics 
of Fraud Cases and Countermeasures Against Such"] 
  [Excerpts] Looking at all the cases of fraud adjudicated 
since 1991 at the people's court of Jianhu County in Jiangsu 
Province, we see that they have the following characteristics, 
which appear different from those of the past: 
  1) A large increase in the number of cases. In 1991, the 
said 
court adjudicated six fraud cases, in 1992 the cases had 
doubled to 12, and in 1993 is was a multiple of the 1992 figure 
again; these cases are increasing in a geometric progression. 2) 
Increasing magnitude of the objects involved. Few fraud cases 
were for less than 1,000 yuan, they were generally for several 
thousand yuan, and frequently even cases involving over ten 
thousand and several hundred thousand yuan. Cases involving 
more than 10,000 yuan accounted for 36 percent of the total 
cases. The defrauded sums of the cases adjudicated during the 
first quarter of 1993 amounted to 244,800 yuan, which is already 
1.4 times the amount of involved in all case of 1991. 3) The 
scope of such cases has widened. Criminal elements from abroad 
  have entered this country and are committing fraud on the 
mainland. Their activities have occurred in many different 
provinces and cities. 4) Losses due to these fraudulent 
activities have become serious. Objects of these frauds have 
been public and private property. Once accomplished, the 
victims will suffer losses to different degrees, and in some 
cases the consequences are very serious indeed. 5) In most cases 
of fraud village and township enterprises and individual 
contractors had been victimized. Among 25 fraud cases, 15 of the 
victims have been of the mentioned categories, accounting for 60 
percent. 
  The following are the methods used in the commission of 
fraud 
in these cases: 
  Use of false documents to commit fraud. This is the main 
method used by defrauding criminals. The false documents are in 
the majority of cases false letters of introduction, false 
contracts, false testimonials, false resident's identification 
papers, and false seals of office. The use of false documents is 
always the easiest way for defrauders to succeed. 
  Exploiting psychologically the strong desire of factories or 
owners of commodities to sell their goods, using sweet and 
enticing words to hoodwink the sellers. This kind of criminals 
will often exploit psychologically the great eagerness of owners 
of commodities to market their goods, and they will thus worm 
themselves into the confidence of the owners of commodities in 
order to achieve their intended objective which is fraud. 
  Utilizing the opportunity presented by the great need of 
some 
enterprises to import technologies, criminal elements will 
commit fraud by first pretending to be able to provide or 
transfer such technologies. This kind of fraudulent criminals 
will often outwardly appear as honest gentlemen, who will 
pretend to be willing to help backward regions and willing to 
support the development of village and township enterprises. 
They will act ostentatiously, looking for a chance to swindle 
people, boasting of their own capabilities, and thus entice 
people by guile or flattery to fall victims to their fraudulent 
machinations. 
  Exploiting psychologically the eagerness of some people to 
acquire certain commodities, criminal elements will deliberately 
make deceptive statements as to the commodities they offer, and 
thus accomplish their fraud. 
  On the pretext of helping in the management of affairs, they 
will wantonly defraud people of money and possessions. 
Defrauders will often brag and boast about themselves as having 
certain backing and relations that would enable them to help in 
problems concerning registration of domicile, employment as 
cadres or workers, and will in this way swindle some people who 
have had every good intention. 
  Swindling people of money and valuables by banking on the 
greed of some people. A criminal will purposely discard 
something on the street that looks valuable but is a fake. When 
a passerby picks it up, a group of accomplices will suddenly 
appear on the scene and demand a share of the find. As the value 
is shared among everybody involved, the fake item remains in the 
hands of the passerby, who will have had to pay out cash to the 
swindlers as their "share." 
  Swindling people of money and possessions by means of 
superstitions. Cases of this nature occur mostly in the 
countryside and among people of a low level of general 
education; such cases tend to become more frequent almost daily.

<F P=106> [Article by Shih Liu-tzu (4258 2692 1311): "The Beginning of </F>
Journalistic Freedom in Mainland China--the Rise of a 
`Semi-Official' Press"] 
  [Text] Although the CPC authorities still insist on 
putting a tight clamp on the news media, in the wake of 
increasingly thorough reform, the people's field of vision has 
broadened, initial market mechanisms have been formed, and the 
authorities have cut subsidies toward the propaganda units. 
These and other factors inevitably and irreversibly have changed 
the mainland press's sole purpose as propaganda tool. It is 
becoming diversified, multi-purpose, and enterprise-like. A 
"semi-official" press has quietly appeared, and it is full of 
vitality. It is signifying the beginning of the freedom of the 
press in Mainland China. 
  Even though the Chinese authorities are still insisting on 
putting a tight clamp on news media, and the press can be 
destroyed at anytime in a political storm or simply wither away 
under their own self-discipline, in the wake of increasingly 
thorough reform, the people's field of vision has broadened, 
initial market mechanisms have been formed, and the authorities 
have cut subsidies toward the propaganda units. These and other 
factors inevitably and irreversibly have changed the mainland 
press's sole purpose as propaganda tool. It is becoming 
diversified, multi-purpose, and enterprise-like. 
  No doubt mainland China still does not allow individuals to 
run the press, but the overall official tone of the press is 
fading. In the past, people have paid too much attention to the 
major papers put out by the CPC party committee organs and have 
overlooked the rise of the "semi-official" press. Today, these 
publications have a wider readership than the party papers. 
  The quietly flourishing "semi-official" press and its great 
vitality may not have radically changed the media control system 
favored by high-level CPC officials, and news is far from being 
reported in a realistic and objective manner, but the tabloids 
nevertheless are different from the party newspapers with their 
archaic sermons. They are signifying the beginning of 
journalistic freedom in Mainland China. 
<H5>  Tabloids Turning "Mainstream" Newspapers </H5>
  The so-called "semi-official" variety tabloids and trade 
papers refer primarily to the non-official small newspapers as 
compared to newspapers put out by party committee or ministry 
committee organs. They may be derivatives of official newspapers 
or published by various mass organizations or even enterprises, 
or they may be linked to certain units but are in fact 
"privately run" by a few people who share a common goal. 
  These tabloids first appeared in the early 1980's and 
reached 
a peak in the mid-1980's. In 1978, mainland China had less than 
1,000 newspapers of all types; subsequently, with the appearance 
of massive "semi-official" variety tabloids and trade papers, 
the number grew to more than 1,600. In 1989, many popular 
"semi-official" variety tabloids were condemned by the 
authorities. In the second half of 1989 alone, 200 
"semi-official" press were forced to shut down. In 1992, various 
tabloids were "resurrected." 
  Literary Tabloids Were the First To become 
Best-Sellers 
  At the beginning, literary tabloids were the first major 
"semi-official" variety newspapers; they were the best-selling 
tabloids. Most were published by prefectural and city-level 
literary associations and cultural centers. They contained 
primarily martial-arts stories, legendary tales, criminal cases 
and so all. Overall, the quality was poor, and while the 
writings contained little raw sex, they were often accompanied 
by offensive illustrations and headlines. This kind of 
newspapers were generally controlled by individual booksellers 
who spent large sums of money to hire people to write the 
stories and do the illustrations, and they handled the printing 
themselves and used civilian network to distribute them. 
<H5>  Digests Are the Most "Liberalized" </H5>
  This type of newspaper has become the mainstream among the 
"semi-official" tabloids today. Their circulation continues to 
increase. Often they are published weekly on quarto pages, and 
although they are derivatives of the ossified party newspapers, 
they mainly contain articles found in various foreign and 
domestic publications that deal with sensitive issues, 
criticisms of party and governments, media personalities, and 
anecdotes, funny episodes, and literary essays. They are 
tasteful, informative, intellectual, and very interesting. The 
most influential among this type of newspaper are BAOKAN 
WENZHAI, WENZHAI BAO, and WENZHAI ZHOUBAO. 
  An official once said, "The most liberalized newspaper today 
in fact is WENZHAI BAO. It gathers the nation's reports on the 
dark side and even prints abstracts of overseas newspaper 
articles at will. But it is difficult to criticize and censor 
it, because WENZHAI BAO only does the abstracting." 
<H5>  Financial Newspapers Promotes Marketization </H5>
  In the wake of the restructuring of the economic system and 
the opening up of the markets, financial newspapers of all kinds 
began to appear in the early 1980's. They are distributed 
primarily by enterprises, businesses, and government 
departments. The sponsors are mainly government economic 
management departments, economic societies, and enterprises, and 
almost every province has newspapers of this type. They play a 
very important role in the mainland's marketization. They 
include XINXI RIBAO, SHICHANG BAO, JINGJI XINXIBAO, ZHONGGUO 
CHENGXIANG XINXI BAO, XIAOFEI SHIBAO, XINXI SHIBAO, and ZHONGHUA 
GONGSHANG SHIBAO. 
  The most noteworthy among the above is XINXI SHIBAO. It is 
published in Guangzhou and owns its own XINXI SHIBAO 
Corporation. In recent years, its average profit has exceeded 1 
million yuan a year. It not only has repaid the 200,000-yuan 
loan taken out when the paper first started but is partners with 
Hong Kong's CHING-CHI TAO-PAO in forming the Guangfa Press Co. 
Ltd., a company equipped with the latest advanced equipment. It 
also has entered into a joint venture with Zhujiang Foreign 
Trade Construction Corporation to run the Zhujiang Newspaper 
Publishing Co. Ltd. 
<H5>  Youth Magazines Are Cute and Lively </H5>
  This type of newspaper is primarily published by the 
provincial CYL organs, but the editors and reporters in charge 
are mostly young people who are more liberal-minded. Since most 
of them are weekly papers, they can avoid printing official news 
and replace them with cute and lively articles on subjects of 
greater interest to the young people. Among them are QINGNIAN 
BAO, BEIJING QINGNIAN BAO, WUHAN QINGNIAN BAO, QINGNIAN CANKAO, 
and QINGNIAN ZHISHIBAO. 
  In terms of layout, these youth magazines are quite unique: 
For example, BEIJING QINGNIAN BAO uses dark lines to separate 
the columns and handles photographs like posters, and the 
headlines are often cute and different. 
<H5>  Legal Reports Are the Most Exciting </H5>
  This type of newspaper is usually published by various 
provincial and city governments' political and law committees or 
judicial departments. Politically, they are more rigid and 
conservative than the other tabloids, but because they print 
many court cases and occasionally criticize the political and 
legal systems, they are very popular with the readers. 
Circulation has been soaring in recent years. The more 
influential papers include SHENZHEN FAZHI BAO, GUANGZHOU FAZHI 
BAO, SHANGHAI FAZHI BAO, WUHAN FAZHI BAO, and FAZHI ZHOUBAO. 
<H5>  Party Newspapers' Special Zone: Weekend Editions </H5>
  Dry and worn-out political sermons have caused CPC party 
newspapers (including various ministry and committee organ 
papers) and local party papers to rapidly lose readership. In 
recent years, the party newspaper's total circulation has 
plummeted by around 30 percent. 
  At the same time, their "illegitimate sons" are being 
favored 
by many readers. These "illegitimate sons" are the party papers' 
"weekend editions," "month-end editions," and "expanded 
editions." They, together with the GUANGBO DIANSHI JIEMU BAO 
which became popular several years ago and the digests and legal 
newspapers, have become the "hottest newspapers" in town. 
  We use "illegitimate sons" and "special zone" to describe 
the 
"weekend editions" because, as far as the publishers of the 
party newspapers are concerned, it is not the main purpose of 
the "weekend editions" to give publicity to the party's general 
and specific policies. They are recreational "tabloids" catering 
to ordinary citizens, and that makes them "illegitimate." It is 
also because these "weekend editions" are different from the 
"orthodox party newspapers" in writing and layout, and to the 
editing and reporting staff, there is a "special policy" toward 
these "weekend editions," and therefore they are called "special 
zone." They are mutant party papers, and they too are signalling 
the beginning of journalistic freedom in mainland China. 
<H5>  ZHONGGUO QINGNIAN BAO's Inaugural "Weekend Edition" </H5>
  "Weekend edition" was first introduced by the CYL's party 
organ newspaper, ZHONGGUO QINGNIAN BAO, on 4 January 1981. It 
was named ZHONGUO QINGNIAN BAO, Sunday Edition. 
  This Sunday Edition basically did not print any of the 
stuffy 
official documents or the leaders' hackneyed and boring 
speeches; it emphasized intellectual, interesting, literary, and 
social matters. Each page was in fact a "special column" on a 
set topic, including society news, marriage and family, 
historical knowledge, tourism, humorous articles, book review, 
literary works, abstracts, and so on. They also used colored 
prints, and the layout was lively, and basically, it was a 
"supplement"-like tabloid. But this unorthodox "Sunday Edition" 
was very popular at the newspaper stands. 
  On 21 February 1984, a second "weekend edition" was 
published 
in Guangzhou. It was published by NANFANG RIBAO, a Guangdong 
Provincial Party Committee organ publication. It was named 
NANFANG ZHOUMO. It put even greater emphasis on society news and 
media personalities. Its reports were more in-depth, and the 
articles tended to be longer, some as long as 10,000 words. 
Basically it was a magazine-like paper. It differed from some 
popular low-class literary tabloids in that its editing and 
reporting styles were very serious. NANFANG RIBAO was a local 
party newspaper circulating within Guangdong Province, but 
NANFANG ZHOUMO quickly spread to all large- and medium-sized 
cities throughout the nation; sales were brisk. 
  The success of ZHONGGUO QINGNAN BAO's Sunday Edition and 
NANFANG RIBAO's NANFANG ZHOUMO enticed some other newspapers to 
follow in their footsteps. But from 1987 to 1989, the CPC 
continuously cracked down on the press, closing many 
"semi-official" tabloids and magazines and even prohibiting the 
CPC ministry and committee organ newspapers and local party 
newspapers from starting their "weekend editions." As a result, 
the development of "weekend editions" slowed. By 1990, the 
nation had less than 20 "weekend edition" newspapers. 
<H5>  "Weekend Editions" Helped Promote Sales of "Party Papers" </H5>
  After "June 4," almost all CPC party newspapers were 
restored 
to their original form before the fall of the "Gang of Four." 
They were full of articles of harsh criticisms and 
advertisements; information was greatly curtailed. In addition, 
there was a drastic increase in the price of newspapers at that 
time, and with stiff competition from other media such as radio 
and television, party paper circulation plummeted. But 
circulation of newspapers such as JIEFANG RIBAO, GUANGZHOU 
RIBAO, and SHENZHEN TEQU BAO, with their "weekend editions" and 
"expanded editions" (eight folio pages,) was increasing at rates 
of 6-8 percent, forcing many papers to plead with their 
superiors to run "weekend editions" or expanded editions. 
  Thus, from the central authorities to the localities, 
everybody caught the "weekend editions" and expanded edition 
fever. Even REMIN RIBAO put out its DADI ZHOUMOBAN. JIEFANGJUN 
BAO's weekend edition even won the support of some generals. 
They said, "It makes live rich and colorful and gives it a 
modern flavor." 
<H5>  Are Liberal Elements Flocking to the "Weekend Editions"? </H5>
  Of course "weekend editions" do not represent free press; at 
least politically they, like the orthodox party papers, dare not 
step out of bounds. But compared to the orthodox party papers, 
they indeed have their unique characteristics: 
  To capture more readers, the "weekend editions" are much 
more 
readable and more informative. Most have columns entitled "In 
Pursuit of Hot Tips," "Legendary Figures," "Society Close-Up," 
"News Analysis," "Wide-Angle Lens," "Marriage and Family," "Hot 
Topics," "Hong Kong-Macao-Overseas," "Police Whistle," 
"Anecdotes on Movie and Recording Stars," "Everyday Questions 
and Answers," "Mini Bookseller," "Abstracts," and so on. 
"Society News" and other special topics emphasize 
news-worthiness, literary content, and readability. They take 
social topics and social issues that attract much attention but 
are not abrupt incidents, and they report them at different 
levels. "Hong Kong-Macao-Taiwan Overseas Affairs" often carries 
abstracts of articles published in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and 
overseas newspapers, including reportages on overseas democracy 
movements (of course these are negative reports, but the readers 
can get an idea of the democracy movements abroad.) "News 
Analysis" has deep-probing antennas too. "Abstracts" is even 
more of a condensed information warehouse. 
  Take some of the articles published in JIEFANGJUN BAO's 
Weekend Edition for example. They are more interesting than the 
ordinary formal and proper reportages: "The Sino-Russian Border 
Under the Watch Tower," published on 30 May 1992; "Our Little 
Japanese Friends, a Xisha Sailor Has Picked Up the Bottle You 
Set Adrift," published on 23 May; "The Mysterious Chinese Man in 
the Gulf War" and "China's Frogmen," both published on 13 June. 
  A writer said, "The liberalized elements have all flocked to 
the Weekend Editions." Indeed, many writers who were censured 
just two years ago have quietly reappeared on the "weekend 
editions." Compared to the days when they "gave advice to the 
nation and wrote encouraging words," the only change is that 
some of these people are no longer keen on discussing great 
plans for the country or writing prescriptions to save the 
world. They are no longer full of fire, nor do they care to 
state their case with vehemence; instead, they have risen above 
worldly affairs and can talk everything under the sun, and in 
their irreverence, they are both serious and humorous. Their 
style is not unlike that of Lin Yutang and Zhou Zuoren of the 
by-gone days. 
  The "weekend editions" use simple narratives and everyday 
language, and the readers readily accept this kind of "popular 
culture" (or "consumer culture") in a familiar and natural 
setting. 
  In terms of page layout, the "weekend editions" are more 
meticulous and refined than the orthodox party newspapers. Most 
either use red highlight or color print; they use block setting 
and dazzling headlines, and they emphasize writing as well as 
illustrations and accept all types of literary styles. 
<H5>  The "Popular" Magazine Craze Is Still Going Strong </H5>
  Compared to newspapers, magazines are even more 
folk-oriented; they are even bolder in stepping on the forbidden 
zones of news reporting. The most important sign of this is that 
many writers' reportages are being published in magazines. In 
fact, not only are writers but many newspaper reporters are 
turning their most substantive, most in-depth, most dangerous 
news articles into reportages and sending them to the magazines 
for publication. The fact that magazines are more voluminous is 
certainly a factor, but more important is that compared to 
newspapers, magazines are less tightly controlled by the "party." 
  Of course, the party has very "discerning" eyes. In the two 
rounds of rectification of the press in 1987 and 1989, magazines 
suffered much greater damage than newspapers. In 1989 alone, 400 
magazines, twice the number of newspapers, were shut down, and 
they were all social-science type magazines. 
  Today, Mainland China has more than 6,500 kinds of regularly 
published magazines; more than 48 percent are in the social 
science category, and 40 percent of that are published by CPC 
organs, groups, and research units; 60 percent are published by 
the localities. Among the social science publications, the 
largest percentage has to do with literature and art, followed 
by cultural and educational journals, and lastly there are the 
financial journals. There are few pure news-oriented magazines, 
but the variety magazines usually carry a large number of news 
articles. 
  Like the tabloids, in the course of developing different 
types of magazines, there is a mixture of good and bad 
magazines. Tasteless, superstitious, pornographic, violent, 
brutal crime magazines whose sole purpose is to make money are 
doing extremely well in the market. But there are also many 
outstanding magazines that propagate Western civilization, make 
in-depth reports on China's real problems, uncover historical 
events, or even attack existing abuses and advocate reform and 
opening up. 
<H5>  Political Commentaries and Academic Magazines Occasionally </H5>
Deliver Shocking Opinions 
  Representatives of this type of magazines in the last decade 
are QINGNIAN LUNTAN [YOUTH FORUM], DUSHU [STUDY] and GUOQING 
YANJIU [STATE OF THE NATION]. 
<H5>  Current Events and Factual Reports Touch On a Broad Range of </H5>
Subjects 
  This type of magazines are hot-sellers in the market, 
because 
they cover a wide range of subjects, they are bold, they dare to 
crash the forbidden zones, and because they are very readable. 
Prior to 1989, the better known magazines of this type were 
XINGUANCHA [NEW OBSERVATION], HAINAN JISHI [HAINAN EVENTS], 
DONGFANG JISHI, JINGDAO [GOLDEN ISLAND], WENHUI YUEKAN [ESSAYS 
MONTHLY], HUAREN SHIJIE [CHINESE PEOPLE'S WORLD] (Overseas 
Edition). 
  Although all of the above publications were shut down in 
1989, similar magazines are still around. They include 
NANFANGCHUANG [EAST WIND WINDOW], XINSHIJI [NEW CENTURY], JISHI 
WENXUE [REPORTAGE], and so on. These magazines can take care of 
their own profits of losses; some are directly controlled by 
individual booksellers, and naturally they must publish works 
that attract readers. For example, the objective of Guangzhou's 
NANFANGCHUANG is to "propagate new ideas, lend support to new 
things, uncover new tendencies, and promote new trends." There 
is no mention of "upholding the four basic principles" normally 
cited by all regular publications! Since its founding, that 
magazine has never accepted a cent from the government in the 
form of startup fund, operating fund, financial subsidy, or 
wages. It earns its own keep. 
<H5>  Legal and Youth Magazines Rarely Prints Stuffy Sermons </H5>
  China's political and legal system are ideologically very 
conservative, but the publications put out by them often take 
advantage of their natural conditions to deliver more frequent 
and bolder reports on social issues and crime cases than other 
publications, and therefore they are very popular with the 
readers. The reason behind this is, just like the factual 
reportages, they too are seduced by money and are printing what 
is selling. 
  Publications that target the young people and woman readers 
are seldom stuffy in composition or in content. Compared to the 
reportages and legal magazines, they have much less of a 
political overtone. They emphasize discussing ethics and moral 
principles and introduce the readers to Western society. 
<H5>  There Is Reason To Be Optimistic About Freedom of the Press </H5>
  Changes in mainland China obviously have not been as drastic 
as that in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, but compared to 
the old days, China indeed is completely transforming itself, 
including in the sensitive news media area. If, instead of 
making a simplistic comparison between the CPC's propaganda tool 
and the West's free press, we look at this change from the 
historical point of view, we will have reason to be optimistic 
about journalistic freedom in China in the future. 
  A CASS Journalism Institute researcher made the following 
comment which makes the best conclusion for this article: "A 
spontaneous reform of the press that raises no noise and causes 
no sensationalism is being launched among the mainland's news 
organizations. This reform which comes from below and which has 
never been publicly acknowledged by the authorities can be 
likened to executing a criminal first and report to the emperor 
later--what is done is done. By the time the dogmatic 
ideological leaders realize that the old system is under siege, 
a new mechanism accepted by the people has already been formed."

<F P=106> [Article by Zhang Liping (1728 4539 1627), director of the </F>
Medical Department of the PLA General Logistics Department 
[GLD]: "Unify Conceptualization, Strengthen Economic Management, 
Strive To Meet the Needs of the New Situation"] 
  [Text] Editor's Note: At a seminar devoted to the 
issue of economic management in medical work recently convened 
at the Shenyang Military District Hospital (Sanitarium), Zhang 
Liping presented a complete exposition and set forth clear and 
concrete demands as to how military hospitals can properly 
effect economic management and provided guidance on how to 
develop and administer military hospitals under the new 
situation of market economy. We herewith publish his talk in 
abstract so that units may study and implement it. 
  The strategic plan set forth by the Military Commission [MC] 
for the new era raises greater demands on military hospitals as 
to how they can assure delivery of medical logistics in limited 
warfare under modern conditions, especially those of high 
technology. The establishment of socialist market economy and 
the advancement of medical reform across the country present 
many new conditions and problems for military hospitals. Faced 
therewith, medical logistics leaders at all levels, especially 
comrades engaged in military hospital administration, must keep 
sober and ensure delivery of accurate guidance throughout all 
their work. 
<H5>  I. Unify Conceptualization Regarding How To Respond to the </H5>
New Situation 
  A. "Response" Must Serve To Improve Combat Effectiveness and 
Not Merely To Generate Revenue 
  Whenever discussing response to the new situation of market 
economy, some comrades consider only how to increase revenue, 
equating "response" with money-making. Increasing revenue so as 
to finance operations certainly forms one aspect of "response," 
but there is much more thereto. It means better response to the 
new macroenvironment of market economy through service direction 
and quality and effort in terms of technology, personnel, 
equipment, administration, finance, and other quarters so as to 
help improve combat effectiveness. Thus "assurance" converges 
with "response." Indeed, it is consideration of the external 
effects of market economy that leads us to stress "assurance," 
making it a basic premise. And, at bottom, we actively "respond" 
to the new situation so as to provide better "assurance." 
  B. "Response" Must Proceed from the Fundamental Laws and 
Characteristics of Military Medical Work and Not Mimic Market 
Mechanism 
  Under the new situation, management of military medical 
work, 
especially compensated service provided to locals, should draw 
on, but not mimic, some market mechanism methodology. This is 
dictated by the unique nature, function, and mission of medical 
work, especially military medical work. From the broadest 
perspective, the first requirement in terms of the social 
benefit medical work provides, the basic function of military 
medical work, the very nature of ensuring well-being, the 
characteristics of the military system, and the revolutionary 
humanitarian purpose of saving the dying and treating the 
wounded all differ fundamentally from the principles of market 
economy, whose principal objective is maximizing profit through 
exchange; is premised, in terms of participation, on a high 
degree of autonomy; is guided mainly by market demand; and so on. 
  C. "Response" Must Ensure That Service Direction Does Not 
Skew, Treatment Quality Does Not Fall, and Professional 
Integrity Does Not Slip 
  Under market economy, people's notion and awareness of 
material benefit and private interest grow, and disturbance from 
all directions steadily mounts. So if we fail to adopt effective 
educative and control measures, "assurance" may fail, service 
quality may not meet muster, professional integrity may slip, 
and other bad phenomena may arise. Over the past several years, 
we have unstintingly stressed direction, quality, and integrity. 
Yet even so, noteworthy problems have cropped up in some units. 
For example, in the area of service, some hospitals still show 
lack of dedication and devotion to treatment of army wounded and 
sick; responsibility is shirked in disguised form; and some 
hospitals fail to uphold funding standards in administering 
drugs and even charge soldiers arbitrary fees therefor. Service 
shortfall is even greater when it comes to taking the initiative 
in providing preventive guidance, monitoring disease, and 
technical assistance ties [BANGDAI]. Quality shortcomings are 
saliently manifested as failure to uphold standards for and the 
overall poor quality of basic treatment and care. Many hospitals 
have failed properly to adhere to the system and standards we 
have developed over the past several decades, indeed even such 
basic things as three-tiered examination, pre-surgical and 
pre-death discussion, the "three checks and seven responses," 
and the like. And there are numerous noteworthy problems in the 
area of professional integrity. In today's society, some medical 
personnel lose their sense of right and wrong whenever they see 
profit to be made, succumbing to self-aggrandizement through 
medicine, an evil that is reflected in military hospitals as 
well. We must place great emphasis on the effects the new 
situation creates in the areas of service direction, treatment 
quality, and professional integrity. If we fail to master these 
problems and if existing bad tendencies are allowed to fester, 
the consequences will be unthinkable, and we will be unable to 
face the officers and enlisted personnel of the entire armed 
forces. 
<H5>  II. The Effective Way To Respond to the New Situation Is To </H5>
Stress "Assurance" 
  A. Establish Effective Regulatory Measures 
  To achieve "assurance," we must, while applying 
administrative and legal controls, effectively employ economic 
ones as well. We absolutely must firmly control that which 
should be controlled. Moonlighting, special service, external 
service, work in hospitals run jointly with localities or as 
integrated entities, and the like must strictly abide by 
relevant regulation and approval procedure. No second occupation 
is permitted. And we must scrupulously effect positional 
responsibility for hospital and department directors, provide 
regular performance evaluation, and ensure that reward and 
punishment are appropriately dispensed. 
B. Promptly Systematize and Normatize Successful Experience 
under the New Situation, Including Establishing an Effective 
Self-Restraint System 
  Over the past several years, medical units throughout the 
armed forces have pioneered much new experience in providing 
"assurance." After summarizing, studying, and refining this 
experience, we must integrate it with previous success and study 
how to establish an integrated, coordinated system. With a legal 
system and a normatized basis for behavior, stable service to 
the armed forces can be assured, no matter how the situation and 
environment fluctuate. 
C. Deepen and Elaborate Service 
I stress three things. First, in terms of treating military 
injured and sick, emphasize priority, quality, and convenience; 
fulfill one's mission to the best of one's ability; and assure 
treatment quality and safety as much as possible so as to 
satisfy officers and enlisted personnel. Second, expand hospital 
function and enhance preventive and health-maintenance work. We 
must strengthen integration of prevention and treatment in and 
outside of hospitals and strive to prevent disease in and to 
improve the health of military units. Third, we must, in 
accordance with the requirements of the MC's strategic plan, 
conscientiously prepare so that we can ensure effective response 
to any emergency. These desiderata must be achieved, and 
achieved properly, by all medical units throughout the armed 
forces. 
<H5>  III. Improve and Strengthen Economic Management, Better </H5>
Effect "Assurance," and Better Respond to the Needs of the New 
Situation 
  A. Clarify Objectives and Progressively Advance Economic 
Management 
  To manage military hospitals properly, the most important 
thing is to accurately guide medical work towards service. 
Economic management not only focuses on bottom-line profit but 
should also consider how better to effect the basic functions of 
military hospitals, provide more accurate guidance, improve 
quality and economic results, and serve hospital development. 
Secondly, we must plug loopholes and reduce costs and waste. 
Third, we must establish a vigorous restraint and incentive 
mechanism and fully mobilize initiative. Fourth, we must "keep 
clear books" so that accurate, timely, and scientific 
information and advice is provided to all levels and 
decision-making error is reduced. 
  B. Concentrate Resources on Resolution of Cost-Accounting 
Problems 
  First, we must scientifically and rationally define cost. 
Beyond actual depletion, how and by how much shall we depreciate 
fixed capital? How shall the military-expense conversion portion 
be computed? Of fixed capital, how shall the portions put up by 
superior agencies, locals, through accumulation, jointly, or by 
foreigners be appraised? How shall indirect depletion be 
assessed? Regulations regarding these matters were established 
in GLD Health Department Document 194 of 1989. After several 
years of experience, however, we must reexamine these 
regulations to determine which are suitable, which are truly 
feasible, and which require supplement or revision. 
  Second, we must accurately establish accounting typology. 
Most other countries practice three-tiered accounting. We must 
strive to pave the way for and effect this and account by 
disease type with the patient as basic unit. In view of actual 
conditions in military hospitals, the basis and conditions for 
this approach readily exist. 
  Third is the issue of departmental accounting. As an entity 
that actually provides treatment, the department certainly 
should form an accounting level. However, difficulty, intensity, 
and inputs among departments vary greatly, so careful cross 
comparison thereamong is warranted. And while departments may be 
made accounting units, they must not undertake responsibility 
contracting. We should administer them through 
composite-objective responsibility and treat economic return as 
but one element in evaluating their overall performance. 
  Treatment cost accounting must closely be integrated with 
automation, and computers should become powerful managerial 
tools. Modern management and cost accounting are inseparable 
from automation. Units that have effected automation must 
advance it because this work has considerable potential. Those 
units that have not effected it should begin doing so as soon as 
possible. The master plan must be handled properly, the right 
personnel must be recruited, and things must get rolling 
promptly. Naturally, it is important that leadership provide 
emphasis and support. 
  C. In Applying Economic Measures, Be Attentive To Promoting 
the Beneficial and Eliminating the Harmful, Use the Measures To 
Accurately Guide Hospital Work, and Prevent Them from 
Excessively Stressing Profit and Engendering Unscrupulous 
Money-Grubbing 
  Economic measures are two-edged. If we are to promote the 
beneficial and eliminate the harmful and prevent "money 
grubbing" from arising and spreading, the key lies in accurately 
mastering and employing these measures. First, we must 
accurately handle the relationship between economic results and 
quality. We must stress results but emphasize quality even more 
and increase the weight of the latter in overall performance 
review and in determining bonus distribution. Second, we must 
particularize and concretize the requirements of guidance and of 
principle by incorporating these requirements into the specific 
duties assigned to each administrative post under the positional 
responsibility system. For example, the issues of service 
direction, treatment quality, and professional integrity must be 
linked to positional responsibility, performance evaluation, and 
reward and punishment dispensation so that orders from superiors 
are transformed, via the interest mechanism, into conscious 
behavior by department and individual. Third, we must mobilize 
initiative as much as possible by providing appropriate 
secondary distribution in accordance with both results and 
fairness. Primary distribution focuses principally on results 
and contribution. However, for those units that bear heavy 
"assurance" mission, serve many military units, or are 
unprofitable yet whose work is highly technical, hospitals, in 
addition to effecting primary distribution by department, should 
provide appropriate secondary distribution, taking into account 
both results and fairness as well as the interests of all 
quarters in terms of the overall picture, and thereby fully 
mobilize initiative. 
  D. Take the Correct Path to Revenue Generation and Pursue 
Success through Technology and Integrity 
  Under the new situation, hospitals face many new 
circumstances, contradictions, and difficulties in their effort 
to develop resources and generate revenue, and we must treat 
these seriously. To generate revenue, hospitals must not resort 
to indiscriminate drug dispensing, writing huge prescriptions, 
or unnecessary service, thereby increasing patient financial 
burden. These are impermissible and undermine the image of 
military hospitals. In accordance with the spirit of the 
directives issued by the MC and the GLD and in view of actual 
conditions in military hospitals, the latter should place most 
of their effort on providing technical service and exploiting 
their scientific and technological advantages and strive for 
success in developing through science, quality, and strength in 
terms of technology and integrity. These two approaches form the 
foundation for military hospital effort to achieve successful 
development and can never be relaxed. Strengthening 
technological development is dependent primarily on the 
specialities in which hospitals possess advantage and on 
training and recruiting middle-aged and young personnel. The key 
to strengthening professional integrity lies in transforming 
ideal into reality. We must make this effort fundamental to the 
development of our profession, keep dossiers on the integrity of 
our personnel, use great reward to recognize exemplars, sternly 
punish people lacking in virtue, and resolutely check evil 
practice. 
  E. While Stressing Revenue Generation, Also Stress Economy 
and Strive for Quality While Reducing Waste 
  Hospital economic management involves nothing other than 
needing, making, saving, and exploiting money. Given the 
situation in China, the most fundamental approach is to seek 
quality and reduce waste so as to provide the best treatment 
outcome with the least expenditure input. We must provide better 
treatment for less money. And to do this we must strengthen 
economic management, stress economy, and take advantage of our 
people's superb skills. 
  In reducing expenditure, we must pay particular attention to 
scientific decision-making regarding investment and provide 
repeated study and proof of need when selecting construction and 
developmental projects. Examples that decision-making errors are 
the greatest source of waste abound. We must be careful to plug 
leaks and reduce waste everywhere. For example, drug purchase 
kickbacks run about five percent everywhere. If hospitals can 
strengthen supervision over each link, make secret and private 
operations open and public, a medium-sized unit could save about 
50,000-60,000 yuan a year, which would become tremendous when 
multiplied throughout the armed forces. Even more importantly, 
there is a political factor here, which, if not stressed, will 
send some cadres to ruin. 
  F. Stress Comprehensive Application of All Types of Measures 
  No single type of managerial measure is omnipotent. 
Excessive 
reliance on any one inevitably begets trouble. This is true for 
economic management, too; one cannot rely purely on that 
approach. And this is especially true for military hospitals. We 
must never lose the fine tradition and practice of our armed 
forces, their spirit of arduous struggle, their advantage in 
ideological work, and their organizational discipline of strict 
obedience and of "following orders in everything one does." And 
we must not ignore comprehensive application of ideological, 
administrative, legal, and other measures. 
  G. Strengthen Training of Economic Managers and Develop a 
Corps Adept at Finance 
  All hospitals really need to establish economic managerial 
organs or at least should have experts in this field. Many 
hospital directors hope to resolve the problem through 
organizational expansion, but we must accomplish this work while 
retrenching and reorganizing hospitals throughout the armed 
forces. Each unit and hospital most devote special attention to 
managerial organ and personnel. We must also improve the quality 
of such personnel and train a corps that can handle finance and 
management and, especially importantly, create "amphibians" 
adept at both medicine and finance. We must make solid and 
practical effort to improve management of all military hospitals 
under the new situation.

<F P=106> [Article: "Gansu Province Higher People's Court Work Report"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] During 1993, a total of 73,025 
criminal civil, economic, and administrative cases were heard. 
This was 18.1 percent more than in 1992. Cases tried numbered 
67,473, up 19.5 percent from 1992. These included 7,561 criminal 
cases, or 10.4 percent of all cases that the procuratorate 
prosecuted. The remaining 89.6 percent of the cases were 
accepteed for hearing directly by the courts. 
<H5>  I. Strict Punishment According to Law of Offenders Causing </H5>
Serious Damage to Public Order for the Safeguarding of Social 
Stability 
  During the year, courts at all levels throughout the 
province 
continued a policy of working at multiple tasks at the same 
time, and working with might and main in light of the province's 
public order situation. They persisted in the "severe crackdown" 
struggle, severely punishing all kinds of criminal activities 
that seriously impair social order. Altogether, the courts heard 
8,718 criminal cases of all kinds, 4.2 percent more than in 
1992. They tried 8,385 of these cases in which they sentenced 
10,128 offenders who had already received due legal process, 
38.9 percent of them being sentenced to five years or more in 
prison, to life imprisonment, or to death (including commuted 
sentences). 
  (1) Emphasis on Crackdowns Against Major Offenders; 
Crackdowns Intensified 
  Although social order in the province remained basically 
stable during 1993, there were numerous problems and the 
situation remained serious. Courts at all levels consistently 
made crimes that caused serious disruption of social order the 
major focus of crackdowns, meting out severe and speedy 
punishments according to law. During the year as a whole 4,752 
offenders who had caused serious damage to public order were 
sentenced after due legal process, 67.8 percent of them being 
sentenced to five years or more, to life imprisonment, or to 
death (including commuted sentences). 
  (2) Active Warfare, Concentrating on Both Recurring and 
Localized Serious Criminal Activities 
  Courts at all levels diligently enforced the NPC Standing 
Committee's "Decisions on Banning Drugs," and the programs of 
the provincial CPC committee and the provincial government in 
close coordination with public security and procuratorial 
agencies. In July, the courts concentrated forces for a 
provincewide battle against drug offenses. The provincial court 
issued a special document reiterating the necessity for 
enforcing the NPC "Decisions on Prohibition of Drugs," which 
clearly provide for conviction and sentencing for the sale of 1 
gram or more of heroin. In cases in which less than 1 gram is 
sold but the circumstances are serious, criminal responsibility 
may also be fixed. During 1993, courts throughout the province 
heard 556 drug offense cases meting out sentences in 534 of 
them. A total of 558 offenders were sentenced for smuggling, 
manufacturing, selling, transporting, or illegally possessing 
and illegally growing drugs. Of these, 80.68 percent were 
sentenced to five years or more imprisonment, life imprisonment, 
and death (including commutation of the death sentence). 
  People's courts at all levels took active part in the battle 
against theft, meting out severe sentences to the ringleaders of 
robber gangs, major thieves, habitual offenders, and fugitives. 
They also emphasized crackdowns on sellers of stolen goods. The 
province's court tried 3,042 thieves. At the same time, the 
courts also actively joined the special battle to roundup 
"car-jackers and police officers putting up roadblocks to impose 
fines and fees on motorists." They also cracked down on the 
plundering of ancient tombs, severely sentencing a number of 
offenders. In 1993, the provincial court trial committee found 
one trial court had given too light sentences; it directed 
retrials. Fourteen of the 19 people sentenced to death in the 
retrial of 16 cases were mostly "car-jackers and police officer 
highway extortionists." 
  Criminal activities involving the abduction for sale, and 
the 
kidnapping of women and children, and organizing and forcing 
women to become prostitutes are very serious in some parts of 
the province. During 1993, people's courts at all levels 
diligently enforced the NPC Standing Committee's "Decisions on 
Severe Punishment of Offenders Who Abduct and Sell, or Kidnap 
Women and Children," and "Decisions on Strict Prohibition of 
Prostitution," trying 44 such cases and sentencing 101 offenders. 
  (3) Active Participation in Comprehensive Control of 
Public Order To Reduce and Prevent Crime 
  First was the use of public trials as part of a widespread 
campaign to provide publicity and education about the legal 
system; second was emphasis on the omissions of units concerned 
found in the handling of cases, making judicial recommendations; 
third was adoption of a policy of educating, guiding, and 
rescuing offenders who had not yet reached maturity, making 
education a part of sentences, thereby combining punishment with 
education. Fourth was greater use, according to law, of 
probation and public surveillance of offenders whose offenses 
were fairly slight as local conditions warranted, relying on 
social pressure to effect reform. Fifth was adjudication, 
reduction of sentence, or release on parole, according to law, 
of offenders sentenced to labor reform who showed evidence of 
repentance and intention to change their ways, or who had 
performed meritorious deeds. 
<H5>  II. Harsh Crackdowns on Serious Economic Crimes; Resolute </H5>
Punishment of Graft and Corruption 
  During 1993, peoples courts at all levels waged more battles 
to crack down hard on criminal economic activities, punishing a 
number of serious economic criminals. A total of 533 economic 
crime cases of various kinds were heard, 298 of them involving 
graft and bribe taking. So far 371 offenders have been sentenced 
after due process, 34.5 percent of them to five years or more in 
prison, life in prison, or death (including those whose death 
sentence was commuted). Economic losses amounting to 7,280,600 
yuan were recovered for the state and collectives. 
  In July 1993, the provincial court convened a meeting of 
medium level court judges throughout the province at which, on 
instructions from the supreme court, it emphasized the need to 
use sentences in large and important cases as an object lesson 
in continuing the battle against economic crimes. Law courts at 
all levels responded conscientiously, sentencing 129 offenders 
who had committed economic crimes involving 10,000 yuan or more, 
22 of whom had committed crimes involving 100,000 yuan or more, 
and seven of whom had committed crimes involving 200,000 yuan or 
more. Six of the offenders sentenced were county (or department) 
level cadres. Courts at all levels made crackdowns on graft, 
acceptance of bribes, and the diversion of public funds to 
authorized uses by personnel working in party and government 
leadership organs, judicial units, administrative enforcement 
units, and economic control units the emphasis of strict 
punishment according to law. 
  In hearing economic crime cases, people's courts at all 
levels made sure to move large and important cases forward on 
the docket, delve into them, and hear them promptly. In hearing 
cases, they adhered to two basic principles: one was to make 
sure of the facts and evidence, positively not issuing any 
sentences in cases where the facts were unclear or the evidence 
insufficient. The second was not to wrangle about non-essentials 
when the basic facts and basic evidence was in hand. They 
adhered to the principle of "the need for firmness first, 
prudence second, and handling matters correctly," strictly 
distinguishing between guilt and no guilt. 
  Although definite accomplishments have been made in the 
battle to crack down on economic offenses, some problems also 
exist, the main one of which is that an insufficient number of 
economic crime cases are being brought to court. During 1993, 
courts throughout the province received 489 new economic crimes 
cases, 15.4 percent fewer than during the previous year. This 
situation does not match the actual economic crimes situation 
and the intense reaction of the public to economic crimes. The 
problem of imposing fines instead of meting out punishments has 
still not been solved. In some cases, the sentences are still 
too light. If the battle to crack down on economic crimes is to 
be intensified, matters will have to be handled strictly 
according to law, these problems diligently resolved. 
<H5>  III. Regulation of Economic Relationships According to Law </H5>
To Promote Development of the Market Economy 
  During 1993, people courts at all levels throughout the 
province further intensified their economic trial work, 
regulated economic relationships according to law, ensured 
smooth implementation of national macroeconomic regulation and 
control measures, and strove to intensify economic system reform 
and service to economic development. The number of cases 
involving economic disputes of all kinds that were heard 
increased tremendously, breaking the 10,000 mark to reach 11,900 
cases. This was a 128.5 percent increase over the previous year. 
The courts tried 10,749 cases, the amount of money involved in 
the cases tried totaling 797.52 million yuan. 
  (1) Greater Hearings of Economic Dispute Cases of All 
Kinds To Promote the Building of the Market Economy System and 
Maintain the Economic Order Following Supreme People's 
Court plans to ensure smooth implementation of macroeconomic 
regulation and control through trial work, courts at all levels 
throughout the province held more hearings of financial dispute 
cases. They put special effort into trials for the purpose of 
clearing up call loans and recovering overdue credit. The 
resolved payment default and settlement disputes for 
construction units and construction engineering departments 
amounting to 27,715,100 yuan, thereby improving construction 
fund returns. They heard 5,260 cases involving procurement and 
marketing, property leasing, processing contract, technical 
cooperation, and patent and trademark disputes, liquidating or 
recovering 171.75 billion yuan in delinquent payments for goods 
and services, thereby safeguarding the legal property rights and 
interests of enterprises and legitimate competition in routine 
business activities and market exchange. They tried 323 cases 
involving enterprise contracting, leasing, partnership, 
bankruptcy, mergers, and economic equity rights disputes, 
including 12 enterprise bankruptcy cases. They heard 108 
economic dispute cases stemming from rural reform and 
development, most of them rural contract dispute cases, thereby 
steadying responsibility systems, notably the family 
output-related contact responsibility system to advance rural 
economic development. 
  (2) Reform and Perfection of the Economic Judicature 
System Thereby Further Improving Case Handling Quality and 
Efficiency The system of placing the burden of proof on 
those making allegations continue to be applied in the hearing 
of economic dispute cases. In cases in which the facts were 
clear and evidence ample, a direct court hearing and speedy 
solution was tried out. In cases in which the facts and the 
circumstances were uncomplicated, when simple procedures in 
accordance with law could be applied, they were applied, and 
where oversight procedures were required, they were also 
applied. They improved the mediation of economic dispute cases, 
the number of cases mediated for the year increasing 72.46 
percent over 1992. Courts at all levels paid particularly close 
attention to trials of major and important economic dispute 
cases. 
  (3) Improved Service Awareness, Broadening the Service 
Realm. The first step taken in improving service awareness 
and broadening the service realm was the establishment of a 
mediation center for economic disputes for the purpose of 
mediating disputes before they went to trial. During 1993, such 
centers heard 4,343 economic dispute cases involving a total of 
294.34 million yuan, 3,867 of which were successfully mediated. 
In August, the provincial court also set up a center to mediate 
real estate disputes, which heard 63 cases by the end of the 
year, successfully mediating 37 of them involving 7.15 million 
yuan. Second was closely linking legal services with case 
handling in an effort to extend services. Courts throughout the 
province have set up with 1,179 enterprises a system in which 
the enterprises designate one or more personnel contact points 
on economic judicial matters, 1,269 such contact personnel 
having been designated. Some courts also set up enforcement 
centers, or some administrative enforcement departments have set 
up enforcement courts or enforcement offices to provide special 
services. Very many courts also provided training classes that 
provide information about the law to persons in charge of 
enterprises and administrative personnel. These methods have 
yielded very good social benefits for economic construction. 
<H5>  IV. Good Performance of Civil Affairs and Administrative </H5>
Trials To Safeguard the Legal Rights and Interests of the 
Citizens and Legal Entities 
  Courts at all levels throughout the province have strictly 
enforced civil law and policies, actively hearing all sorts of 
civil cases. During 1993, they heard 33,372 civil cases, 10.54 
percent more than in 1992, and they adjudicated 31,771 of them 
for a 95.2 percent adjudication rate. Civil cases account for 
more than 60 percent of all cases straight in the courts. 
Marriage cases, debt cases, and compensation cases account for a 
respective 66.15, 15.42, and 11.6 percent of civil cases. They 
occupy first, second, and third place, respectively, among civil 
cases. Therefore, people's courts at all levels pay close 
attention to the hearing of marriage, family, and inheritance 
cases. In the division of property for inheritance, in caring 
for women and children, and in the apportionment of housing, the 
courts made sure to protect the rights of women, children, the 
aged, and those unable to make a living. Second was the hearing 
of 6,883 cases involving indebtedness, houses, and labor 
disputes, and payment of compensation for damages, 4,823 of 
which were adjudicated. This was 22.8 percent more than in 1992. 
Third was the adjudication according to law of 2,883 personal 
injury compensation cases, 52 reputation and image rights cases, 
and 10 intellectual property rights cases. This adjudication 
promptly resolved conflicts, thereby advancing popular unity for 
substantial effect on society. 
  Courts at all levels throughout society persisted in the 
protection of the legal rights and interests according to law of 
citizens, juridical entities, and other organization. They also 
adhered to the principle of safeguarding and supervising 
administrative organs exercise of functions according to law, 
hearing all sorts of administrative cases. They particularly 
emphasized large and important cases having a major social 
effect and about which there were strong feelings from all 
quarters to promote the development of administrative trial 
work. During 1993, the province's courts heard and tried 403 
administrative cases, 2 percent more than in 1992, successfully 
adjudicating 390 of them. Of the administrative cases 
successfully adjudicated, the decisions of administrative organs 
were upheld in 32.05 percent, overturned in 15.38 percent, 
partially overturned in 3.59 percent, appeal rejected in 6.15 
percent, and the original complain dismissed in 35.64 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Liangduo (2621 5328 1122): "Dialectical Unity </F>
of Opening Up Policy With Independence and Self Reliance"] 
  [Text] Independence and self-reliance are basic tenets of 
Mao Zedong's thoughts, and they relate to and reinforce China's 
policy of opening up to the outside. But in everyday life, this 
is not understood in dialectical terms, and incorrect attitudes 
toward the issue still prevail. Some people think that a strong 
emphasis on independence and self-reliance would amount to 
weakening or even rejecting the opening up policy, so in 
implementing the policy they often forget or refrain from 
talking about independence and self-reliance; this one-sided 
thinking has undoubtedly caused harm to our country's opening up 
policy and socialist modernization and development. 
  Independence and self-reliance are totally different from 
isolating ourselves and rejecting things foreign. During the 
revolutionary period as well as the era of construction, comrade 
Mao Zedong made clear that in striving for independence and 
self-reliance, we also needed foreign assistance. He always 
advocated broadening our horizon and, on the basis of the 
principles of independence and self-reliance, proceeding to 
develop peaceful and friendly relations and exchanges in 
political, economic, cultural and other fields with all 
countries, while keeping up a relentless struggle to break up 
any attempts by the West to isolate or boycott China. Even 
during the "Great Cultural Revolution," he proposed that we 
analyze the world from three perspectives, namely to break the 
deadlocks in the Sino-U.S. and Sino-Japanese relations and to 
regain China's seat in the United Nations. Of course, 
constrained by historical conditions, comrade Mao Zedong's 
thinking on opening up to the outside did not develop to the 
extent as it has today, but he paved the way for the opening up 
policy. 
  The Third Plenum of the 11th CPC National Congress 
established the basic line of "one center and two basic points." 
Opening up to the outside has become a basic national policy to 
be firmly supported over the long term and it represents an 
important step toward establishing socialism with special 
Chinese characteristics. In over a decade, achievements of this 
policy are clearly notable and have contributed greatly toward 
China's modernization and development. Implementation has 
demonstrated that the policy is entirely correct. 
  The opening up policy is a prerequisite condition of 
independence and self-reliance; they complement and mutually 
reinforce each other. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out: 
"Independence and self-reliance represent our basic points of 
reference, whether in terms of the past, the present or the 
future." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume 
III, page 3). "In developing a country as large as China, we 
cannot help but rely on ourselves, and primarily on ourselves, 
and that is the essence of self-reliance" (Ibid., Volume III, 
page 78). The opening up policy is necessary and important 
because it helps develop socialism, strengthen our country as a 
whole and raise the people's standard of living; as a result, it 
helps Chinese people maintain their independence and 
self-reliance and speed up our socialist modernization and 
development. Independence and self-reliance provide 
indispensable objective condition and support for the opening up 
policy; the policy, in turn, is based on the unshakable 
foundation of independence and self-reliance. Any viewpoint or 
action which splits these two internally related and unified 
concepts is wrong and harmful. 
  The relationship of these two concepts is unitary and has a 
primary and a secondary objectives. The primary objective is to 
firmly maintain our independence and self-reliance; the 
secondary but complementary objective is to actively seek 
foreign assistance. Since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC 
National Congress, comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed 
this [two-fold] objective; he said: "In the end, the objective 
of our construction is the same as Mao Zedong had formulated in 
the past, namely with its primary focus on self-reliance and its 
complementary focus on striving to obtain foreign assistance." 
(Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping: 1975-1982, page 
310) The "primary" and "supporting" elements in the relationship 
cannot be equal, and certainly cannot be reversed. For example, 
attracting foreign investment is undoubtedly very much needed, 
since to a certain degree foreign capital can supplement 
inadequate Chinese capital for construction, but we absolutely 
cannot depend entirely on foreign investment or put all our hope 
on foreign capital; we cannot disregard the consequences of 
relying on foreign capital and pay the price which hurts China's 
interest, damages our national policy and debases the morality 
of our society. Otherwise, it would not be our making use of 
foreign capital, but the latter making use of us. In the whole 
process of socialist modernization and development, regardless 
how far we open up to the outside, the role that foreign 
assistance plays will proportionately be relatively limited; it 
can only "play a support role in developing production under 
socialism" (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume 
III, page 181); furthermore, any type of foreign assistance must 
conform to China's reality and it can only be used effectively 
in conjunction with efforts by the Chinese people themselves; 
besides, it is certainly not easy to obtain capital and advanced 
science and technology from countries of the West. Therefore, 
only when we set our objective based on our own strength, then 
seek foreign assistance on the basis of self-reliance and mainly 
our own conscientious struggle, will we ultimately stand on 
victorious ground. 
  The thrust of opening up to the outside must be to serve the 
interests of economic construction. The various aspects of the 
opening up policy should be based on the realistic need and 
feasibility of China's modernization and development. We need to 
attract advanced technology and facilities from abroad, but to 
do so only after deliberating carefully and avoiding duplicated 
imports wasteful of China's capital; we need to set up 
development zones but we must also seek truth from facts and 
consider the reality of the zones, China's ability to absorb the 
imports, and the various factors involved in calculating the 
value of setting up such zones; we must not in a burst of 
enthusiasm rush into doing things, nor proceed on the basis of 
narrow interests of certain zones without considering how they 
relate to or support each other. We need to learn from foreign 
countries, but we must do so analytically, critically and 
selectively; we must learn the strong points of other countries, 
the good things which are truly advanced, and not things which 
are backward and passe. Our country is a socialist state, and 
our modernization and development is socialist modernization and 
development; in our opening up policy, we absolutely cannot 
bring in corrupt ideas and lifestyle of the capitalist system. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping has clearly pointed out: "In implementing 
our policy of opening up, learning foreign technology and 
utilizing foreign capital, we must do so in the interest of 
socialist construction, and we cannot depart from the socialist 
road." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping , Volume III, 
page 195) In the entire process of carrying out our opening up 
policy, we must firmly protect and maintain China's independence 
and sovereignty. For over a hundred years China had endured 
aggression and oppression by various Western powers, and 
suffered deeply the bitterness of national humiliation and 
deprivation of rights. The Chinese people value highly our 
national independence and sovereignty gained with the blood and 
lives of countless revolutionary martyrs. Today, despite the 
great changes in the international scene, big power politics and 
hegemonism still remain. Internationally, hostile forces are 
still trying hard to overthrow China's system of socialism 
through peaceful evolution tactics. We must keep a clear head 
and carry out resolute struggle. National independence and 
sovereignty are the basic rights of the Chinese people, and on 
any issues which interfere with our national independence and 
sovereignty, the Chinese people's interests and their honor and 
self-respect, we will never compromise on these principles. Just 
as the way Comrade Deng Xiaoping put it: "The Chinese people 
value the friendship and cooperation with other countries and 
peoples, but value even more their own independence and 
sovereignty gained through a long period of struggle. No foreign 
country should expect China would become their vassal, or to 
shallow the bitter fruit harmful to our national interests." 
(Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume III, page 3) 
In looking forward to the opening up policy achieving important 
results, we should also be aware that in terms of the 
relationship between that policy and our independence and self- 
reliance, certain problems still remain. In particular, some 
people think that simply by carrying out the opening up policy, 
capital, facilities and technology, etc., will flow in from 
abroad, and that there will be no need for self-reliance or 
struggling to start our own businesses; some people working in 
the so-called "opening up" and "introducing foreign things into 
China" areas have no qualm about harming the national or 
people's interests in the process. Some people, disregarding 
reality, conditions or needs, think that starting more and more 
"development zones" means greater political accomplishment, or 
that attracting more things foreign demonstrates their talent 
and ability. Particularly obnoxious are people who, in the 
economic exchanges of the opening up process, have developed 
various corrupt and evil tendencies. All this goes against the 
Party's basic line, and Party discipline and the country's laws 
will not stand for it. 
  At present, China is striving to realize the strategic 
objective in the second stage of socialist modernization and 
development, and we need to rectify the relationship between the 
opening up policy and [our] independence and self-reliance; in 
carrying out the opening up policy, we must firmly establish the 
spirit of self-reliance and pioneering struggle. And We must 
resolutely overcome the negative and corrupt phenomena produced 
by opening up to the outside.

<F P=106> [Article: "Leaders Speak -- Optimize Capital Structure, </F>
Increase Enterprise Strength, Strive To Do a Good Job With Large 
and Medium-sized State Enterprises -- Speech Given by State 
Economic and Trade Commission Director Wang Zhongyu (3769 1813 
4416) at the Working Conference on Experimental Cities"] 
  [Text] Today in Beijing we are convening the First National 
"Optimize Capital Structure, Increase Enterprise Strength" 
Experimental City Working Conference. The central theme of this 
conference is clarifying the guiding thought and studying how to 
formulate an experimental implementation plan for the 
experiment. Since the idea to conduct the experiment to 
"optimize the capital structure and increase enterprise 
strength" in some cities was proposed, it has received serious 
consideration from several provinces and municipalities. 
Moreover, the concerted effort of our nine ministries and 
commissions has acquired the support of State Council leaders. 
<H5>  I. The Current Enterprise Reform Situation and Our Task </H5>
  The enterprise reform situation is very good. First, the 
orientation of enterprise reform has already been clearly shown. 
The Decision of the Third Plenary Session indicates that 
establishing a modern enterprise system with "clear property 
rights, explicit rights and responsibilities, division between 
government and enterprises, and scientific management is a 
definite requirement for developing a socialist large production 
and market economy and is the orientation of China's state 
enterprise reform." For a period in the future, it will be an 
important task of enterprise reform to cause large- and 
medium-sized enterprises that are prepared to essentially 
accomplish conversion of mechanisms and establish a modern 
enterprise system that meets the demands of the socialist market 
economy system to make full use of the main force function of 
large and medium-sized state enterprises in the socialist market 
economy, and spur the entire national economy to sustained, 
rapid, and sound forward progress. Secondly, reforms of the five 
major systems of treasury and taxes, finance, investment, 
foreign trade, and planning have been implemented one after the 
other. With reform of the tax system having been implemented for 
a month and a half, it has generally gone smoothly and no major 
problems have occurred. The transition to a tax system dividing 
responsibility with local treasuries and the transition to a 
unified tax system for the enterprise contract system is an 
extraordinary thing. Although some problems have been exposed in 
the implementation, the party Central Committee and the State 
Council are adopting measures to resolve the problems and 
improve the situation. We have investigated the situation of the 
new tax system in eleven industries. All reflected that quite a 
few problems with increased value added tax burdens in such 
industries as coal, small chemical fertilizer, pesticide, and 
small water and electricity have already been resolved and the 
independent mine resource tax problem is being negotiated. 
Leading comrades in the State Council have pointed out several 
times that they will account for the tax reduction and tax 
exemption policy approved by governments at the provincial level 
and above before the end of June 1993 and within two years they 
will adopt methods for late return of previously levied taxes. 
The Ministry of Finance and the State General Bureau of Taxation 
are formulating concrete suggestions. The general spirit is not 
to lightly change the policy that is in effect and to focus on 
smoothly establishing new mechanisms. The implementation of 
these macroeconomic measures has changed the situation of 
enterprise reform's being an isolated force penetrating deep 
into enemy territory and has caused enterprise reform from being 
alone to enter a new stage generally coordinated with other 
reforms and has provided state enterprises with a new 
development opportunity to move toward the market and 
participate in competition. Third, there is a series of laws and 
regulations regarding enterprise reform. For example, such laws 
and regulations as the Enterprise Law, Mechanism Conversion 
Regulations, Supervision and Management Regulations (to be 
implemented), Accounting Standards, and the General Rule on 
Financial Affairs, along with the Company Law have been 
promulgated and implemented, creating a rather good legal 
atmosphere for enterprise reform. 
  Based on the orientation and tasks of enterprise reform and 
this year's situation, in accordance with the principle of 
"combining overall progress with key breakthroughs" proposed in 
the Decision of the Third Plenary Session, we have proposed a 
plan "for converting mechanisms and establishing the system and 
ten thousand, thousand, hundred, and ten" plans based on 
thorough investigation and analysis and repeated solicitation of 
the suggestions of provinces, municipalities, and enterprises. 
"Converting mechanisms and establishing the system" is the 
abbreviation of the theme of the second part of the Decision. It 
speaks of promoting overall enterprise reform. That is, all 
state enterprises should do a good job of implementing the 
Regulations on Converting Mechanisms and the Supervision and 
Management Regulations to be implemented concentrating their 
efforts on converting mechanisms to create the conditions for 
laying a good base to establish a modern enterprise system. The 
"ten thousand, thousand, hundred, ten" is a concretization of 
the key breakthroughs in current enterprise reform,. That is, by 
some enterprises (indicating 10,000, 1,000, and 100 enterprises) 
advancing a step and coordinating their reforms with some cities 
(indicating some ten cities), a breakthrough is achieved in an 
important link to act as a model to effectively spur on overall 
enterprise reform, and "converting mechanisms and establishing 
the system" and "ten thousand, thousand, hundred, ten" are an 
organic whole. 
  To promote overall "conversion of mechanisms and 
establishment of the system" requires that all regions and 
departments and all enterprises do a good job in the following 
three efforts: 
  1. Unremittingly persist in thoroughly implementing the 
Regulations on the Conversion of Mechanisms. The 
Regulations on the Conversion of Mechanisms are the cornerstone 
for establishing the socialist market economy system. We should 
implement to the letter the rights and responsibilities 
conferred on enterprises by the Regulations on the Conversion of 
Mechanisms. First, we should implement the base of the fourteen 
autonomies, leading to enterprises' using autonomy well, 
sufficiently, and actively. Second, every department should 
formulate and implement accompanying regulations to the 
Regulations on the Conversion of Mechanisms. Third, we should 
continue to increase publicity and in cooperation with the 
procurator's department, we should investigate and prosecute 
cases of attacks and reprisals toward enterprises in violation 
of the Regulations on the Conversion of Mechanisms and expose 
them in the news to the point of pursuing legal responsibility. 
Fourth, seize the opportune time for government reform and 
promote conversion of government functions. This year we should 
make a breakthrough in handling self-management of foreign trade 
import and export rights and refuse to apportion rights, and 
improve methods of approval, simplify procedures, and improve 
efficiency of foreign trade import and export rights. We should 
let enterprises that have already been given the rights to 
manage imports and exports themselves enjoy the same rights as 
foreign trade enterprises in such aspects as export licenses and 
allotment of quotas. We should curb arbitrary apportionment as 
an important way of coming to grips with anti-corruption. 
Regions and industries should combine their actual situations 
and formulate specific methods to curb arbitrary apportionment 
and announce them to the masses and enterprises to be monitored 
and enforced. 
  2. Organize the implementation of the Supervision and 
Management Regulations and establish a system for supervision 
and management of state assets. The Supervision and 
Management Regulations are the completion and development of the 
Regulations on Converting Mechanisms. The Supervision and 
Management Regulations are mainly aimed at the current situation 
of mismanagement and serious erosion of state assets. On the one 
hand, relevant departments should take responsibility for 
supervising the state assets of enterprises that they are 
assigned to supervise and as needed conscientiously assign 
supervisory board tasks. On the other hand, we should determine 
enterprise legal person property rights and establish a system 
of asset management responsibilities linked to the managers' own 
interests, increasing their value based on ensuring that state 
assets are not eroded. 
  3. Actively and safely establish a modern enterprise 
system. Assisted by the Central Committee financial and 
economic leading group, with our commission taking the lead 
together with more than ten departments, we have investigated 
and studied the subject of a modern enterprise system and at the 
demand of the financial and economic leading group, we have 
taken steps to establish a modern enterprise system. We believe 
that in establishing a modern enterprise system, we should 
especially pay attention to doing a good job of handling the 
relations between experimental enterprises and other 
enterprises. All enterprises should conscientiously implement 
the Regulations on Conversion of Mechanisms and the Regulations 
on Supervision and Management and carry out the Accounting 
Standards and the General Rule on Financial Affairs and reform 
enterprise labor, personnel, and wage allocation systems, 
lighten the social burdens that enterprises handle, clear up 
credits and liabilities, reappraise stocks and assets, and 
demarcate property rights. This is the main content of the 
current enterprise reform and creates the necessary conditions 
for establishing a modern enterprise system. This means that in 
carrying out the reforms described above we are giving impetus 
to state enterprises' moving in the direction of a modern 
enterprise system. This is a reform that all enterprises should 
now conduct. At the same time, we should recognize that 
establishing a modern enterprise system is an arduous and 
complicated task, especially for a state enterprise to become a 
company requires trials. We should guard against all enterprises 
rushing to reorganize as companies, watering down or overlooking 
the Regulations on Converting Mechanisms and the Regulations on 
Supervision and Management. 
  While generally steadily promoting "conversion of mechanisms 
and establishment of the system," we should use the "ten 
thousand, thousand, hundred, and ten" form to realize key 
breakthroughs. "Ten thousand" means to thoroughly implement the 
Enterprise Law and the Regulations on Converting Mechanisms and 
do a good job of carrying out the Two Standards in 10,000 large 
and medium-sized state enterprises and accomplish the task of 
reappraising stocks and assets and essentially accomplish 
conversion of mechanisms. "Thousand" means that in implementing 
the Regulations on Supervision and Management, the state by 
stages and in groups should assign supervisory boards to 1,000 
key mainstay enterprises related to the national economy and the 
people's livelihood and inspect the state assets of the 
enterprises. This task is beginning. "Hundred" means with the 
unified leadership and planning of the State Council, to select 
100 large and medium-sized state enterprises of different types 
to establish an experimental modern enterprise system and 
explore ways for state enterprises to become companies. "Ten" 
means in some ten cities to conduct experiments with the 
complete reform of "optimizing the capital structure and 
increasing enterprise strength" and strive to achieve 
breakthrough progress on the key and difficult problems of 
getting large and medium-sized state enterprises into the market 
and taking part in competition. 
  II. The Object and the Main Content of Selecting Some 
Cities to Conduct Complete Experimental Reform 
  After the suggestion to select ten cities to conduct 
experiments to "optimize capital structure and increase 
enterprise strength" was proposed at the national economic and 
trade working conference, it aroused the general interest of 
provinces and cities throughout the country. Altogether official 
letters have come from 27 provincial and municipal governments 
throughout the country requesting that 39 cities conduct the 
experiment. To do a good job of conducting the experiment 
together, nine ministries and commissions, our commission 
together with the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of 
Finance, the Ministry of Labor, the People's Bank, the Auditing 
Administration, the General Bureau of Taxation, the State Assets 
Bureau, and the Bank of Industry and Commerce, formed the "city 
experiment cooperative working group" and, dividing forces in 
all directions, we conducted on the spot investigation and 
research. On this basis, the document put out jointly by the 
nine ministries and commissions determined the sixteen cities of 
Tianjin, Tangshan, Taiyuan, Shenyang, Changchun, Qiqihar, 
Shanghai, Changzhou, Bengbu, Qingdao, Zibo, Wuhan, Zhuzhou, 
Liuzhou, Chengdu, and Baoji would conduct the experiment in 
"optimizing capital structure and increasing enterprise 
strength," and reported it to the State Council. Cities such as 
Chongqing and Harbin, formerly designated as the six old 
industrial bases, were not listed among the sixteen cities. 
Based on the strong demands of the two cities and the proposal 
of the provincial governments, consideration was given to the 
reform and development needs of the old industrial bases, and 
with the consultation of the nine ministries and commissions, 
Chongqing and Harbin were listed as associates and based on 
their situation they will conduct comparable experiments and 
attend working conferences related to the experiment. 
  According to the data from this investigation and research, 
the sixteen cities together have 3,199 large and medium-sized 
state industrial enterprises, 21.3 percent of the large and 
medium-sized state industrial enterprises in the country, and 
8.3516 million workers, 23.20 percent of the workers in state 
industrial enterprises in the national budget. These enterprises 
together have gross assets of 467.26 billion yuan and net assets 
of 139.4 billion yuan, respectively making up 18.2 percent and 
17.9 percent of the state industrial enterprises in the national 
budget. The 1993 principal indicators and their share of state 
industrial enterprises in the national budget were: gross value 
of industrial output 321.726 billion [yuan], 23.2 percent; sales 
receipts 358.73 billion, 19.8 percent; profits and taxes 
achieved 53 billion, 24 percent, within which profits were 
27.401 billion, 44.20 percent. That is less than one-fifth of 
the large and medium-sized state enterprises with one-sixth of 
the net assets created more than one-fourth of the profits, 
indicating that these new and old industrial bases still have 
potential, but current problems are not small. 
  In selecting the cities described above to conduct the 
"optimize capital structure and increase enterprise strength" 
experiment, the three main considerations were: 
  1. The base for establishing the socialist market 
economy is large and medium-sized state enterprises. In the 
crucial period for converting from the old to the new system, we 
should seize the opportunity and realistically increase the 
strength of state enterprises. This year, with the 
implementation of macroeconomic system reforms, the external 
environment of enterprises is greatly changing and a fair 
competition environment is gradually forming and large and 
medium-sized state enterprises are facing development 
opportunities and serious challenges. So, on the one hand, we 
should direct enterprises' gazes inward and painstakingly 
develop inner skills, and especially by strengthened 
implementation of the Bankruptcy Law, we should weed out 
enterprises that there is no way to save and increase 
enterprises' sense of urgency and sense of crisis and promote 
the conversion of enterprise operating mechanisms. At the same 
time, we must face up to the situation with state enterprises 
and by feeling out the situation and what the financial strength 
of each sector will allow, grasp the precious opportunity to 
transition from the old to the new system and, seeking truth 
from facts, determine the residual problems that the old system 
gives enterprises and create favorable conditions for large and 
medium-sized state enterprises to go into battle with a light 
pack and make great strides in entering the market. 
  2. Enterprise reform still is a key and a difficulty in 
current reforms and we must obtain experience through 
experimentation. Enterprises still are the greatest 
difficulty in the current establishment of the socialist market 
economy and intensification of reforms. Despite the fact that 
other aspects of reform also are rather difficult, we generally 
can learn from foreign experience. For example, in the 
differentiated tax system, most Western countries have 
implemented this type of financial and tax system and in 
banking, most countries in the world have established different 
types of banks. But there still is no foreign precedent for how 
we can make these vast state enterprises smoothly enter the 
market and participate in equal competition. We can only look to 
privatization and this does not conform to China's national 
characteristics. We definitely cannot take this road. State 
enterprises are the mainstay of the market economy and the 
ultimate undertaking of reforms. If complete reforms do not 
arrive, there is no way for state enterprise reform to be 
intensified. But if reform of state enterprises is not 
effectively advanced, it will be difficult for other reforms 
ultimately to be accomplished. So, reform of state enterprises 
has a widespread involvement and numerous problems, and the 
situation is complicated. We must painstakingly organize 
experiments and in practice explore and review experience to 
advance the task that we are faced with. 
  3. One possible way to do a good job with state 
enterprises is to rely on the cities to accomplish comprehensive 
rectification. Reform already has penetrated to today. 
Resolving deep-seated key and difficult enterprise problems can 
no longer go the old way of reducing taxes and conceding 
profits. It is necessary to optimize enterprise organizational 
structure and capital structure with adjustments; establish 
property rights exchange markets with reform of the property 
rights system; and establish an integrated labor force market 
with an improved social insurance system. In these respects, 
fully utilizing city functions and regional advantages is well 
worth doing. 
  In sum, the objective of conducting urban experiments is to 
seek a new line of thinking and new methods to do a good job on 
large and medium-sized state enterprises through these 
experiments. That is, taking large and medium-sized state 
enterprises as the key and using cities as the basis, closely 
focus on current key and difficult problems and by complete 
reforms and comprehensive rectification, strive to obtain 
breakthrough progress and strengthen large and medium-sized 
state enterprises to effectively combine the public ownership 
system and the market economy to lay a firm foundation for 
establishing the socialist market economy. 
  To accomplish the goals described above, the main content of 
the urban experiment can be simply summarized with eight 
characters: bankruptcy [pochan (4275 3934)], replenishment 
[buchong (5943 0339)], stripping [boli (0475 4418)], and 
lightening the load [qingzhuang (6535 5944)]. The first thing is 
to strengthen the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law and step 
up organizational restructuring of enterprises. Those 
enterprises that do not have the resources to pay off their 
debts in kind and have no hope of turning around their losses 
and cannot clear the debts that are due should be declared 
bankrupt and, by means of the experimental norms, we should 
proceed with legislation to promote the conversion of operating 
mechanisms. The Bankruptcy Law has been officially implemented 
since 1988. It has already been six years. Although the number 
of enterprises that have relied on the law through the courts to 
declare bankruptcy has increased from year to year, for various 
reasons, such as the systems, the concepts, and the overall 
situation, mechanisms to select the superior and weed out the 
inferior still have not been completely established. This time 
we should use the cities as a basis and truly establish a 
weeding out mechanism external to the enterprises and 
self-restraint mechanisms within the enterprises and bring along 
and advance the establishment and improvement of a social 
insurance system. We should rely on cities to establish a 
property rights exchange market and by property rights exchanges 
optimize asset accumulations and enhance the basic function of 
the market in asset distribution. Secondly, we should adopt 
various measures and multiple channels to replenish enterprise 
self-circulating funds. First, enterprises should fully utilize 
policies already in effect such as income tax rate cuts, the 
abolition of adjusted taxes and "two funds," and not submitting 
after tax profits in the near term, and implement the Two 
Standards to accelerate depreciation and conscientiously 
replenish circulating funds. Half in principle, enterprises 
should use exemption from submitting "two funds" and after-tax 
profits to replenish circulating funds. At the same time, the 
central government, departments, and localities also should 
strive together to replenish enterprise capital by multiple 
channels and resolve the problem of a serious inadequacy of 
enterprise production and operating funds and realistically 
strengthen enterprises. The third thing is to establish labor 
force markets, strip enterprise social functions, and improve 
the social insurance systems with cities as the center. The test 
cities should gradually take on various functions for society. 
For example, arrange for such functions as enterprises' 
surplusing by various channels to create the conditions for 
intensifying the reform of three internal enterprise systems. 
The fourth thing is to feel out situations, structures, and 
contributing factors to the unreasonable burdens that the old 
system has formed for test city large and medium-sized state 
enterprises, and by stages and in groups resolve the problems 
described above. We should review our experiences while 
experimenting, and give impetus to the task that confronts us 
and strive by the end of the Eighth 5-Year Plan to be able to 
completely implement the regulations to convert the enterprise 
operating mechanisms of large and medium-sized state 
enterprises, the mainstay of the national economy, and get them 
into the market and participating in competition.

<F P=106> [Article by Hu Deqiao (5170 1795 1564), affiliated with the </F>
State System Reform Commission's General Office: "Storming the 
Fortifications: Reform of China's Property Rights System"] 
  [Text] As property rights is a crucial economic system 
matter, property-rights system reform is the crux of economic 
system reform. 
  In China's 15 years of reform and opening, our property 
rights relations have undergone a great change. In the last two 
years in particular, our pace of property rights reform has 
clearly accelerated. 
<H5>  I. The Ownership Structure </H5>
  As to the proportional structure of our national GVIO and 
retail commodity sales, from 1978 to the end of 1992, our ratio 
of output value to gross value of industrial output dropped from 
77.6 percent to 48.3 percent for state industrial enterprises, 
with this ratio for collective industrial enterprises up from 
22.4 percent to 38.2 percent, and for other industrial 
enterprises, such as foreign-funded enterprises, individual, and 
private, up from zero to 13.5 percent. In retail commodity 
sales, the state-sector percentage dropped from 54.6 percent in 
1978 to 41.3 percent by 1992, with the percentage down for the 
collective sector from 43.3 percent to 27.9 percent, but up for 
other economic components from 2.1 percent to 30.8 percent. This 
shows that our unitary public-ownership system has been replaced 
by a group-ownership structure dominated by public ownership. 
<H5>  II. Upgrading the Shareholding System </H5>
  In the last two years, China has created a good public 
climate for shareholding-system experiments, making these two 
years our historical stage of the best and fastest growth for 
shareholding-system enterprises. By the end of 1993, China had 
over 10,300 experimental shareholding enterprises in all fields, 
with 182 joint-stock companies from more than 20 provinces and 
autonomous regions throughout China listed in Shanghai and 
Shenzhen, for an overall stock market value (for A shares) of 
about 400 billion yuan. In 1993, while actively issuing shares 
to the public and continuing to expand the supply of 
experimental B shares offered to foreign investors, nine of our 
strongest state enterprises raised capital on international 
money markets. In addition, the number of urban shareholding 
enterprises had topped 100,000 by the end of 1993. And rural 
shareholding-cooperative enterprises have grown rapidly in 
number to 2.08 million, making up 10 percent of all township 
enterprises in China. 
<H5>  III. Foreign-Investment Attraction and Capital Export </H5>
  China has basically evolved a new order of a "three-coast" 
open front along the coast, the rivers, and the borders and an 
overall opening on all levels in the hinterland regions, 
steadily improving our foreign investment climate. Statistics 
show that 126 countries and regions have invested in China, with 
the largest investment from Hong Kong, and next from Taiwan and 
the United States. We have accumulated 167,500 foreign-funded 
enterprises. By the end of 1993, China had approved 174,000 
foreign-invested projects, for contracted foreign investment of 
$217.216 billion, and an actual foreign investment of $56.912 
billion. China has become the country with the largest inflow of 
foreign investment in the world. 
  In the last two years, foreign-funded enterprises have begun 
to gradually expand from coastal zones toward inland provinces 
and cities and western China. 
  China is not only the largest recipient of foreign 
investment, but also the largest capital exporter among 
developing countries. China has set up and invested in 4,497 
enterprises in over 120 countries and regions, with 2,927 being 
trading enterprises, and 1,570 non-trade ones, for an overall 
Chinese investment of $5.16 billion. 
<H5>  IV. Practicing "State Ownership but Private Operation" for </H5>
Small State Enterprises 
  In the last two years, we have conducted reform experiments 
mostly in the forms of leasing and leased sale, which has become 
a reform hotspot for our state commercial, supply and marketing 
cooperative, and grain systems throughout China. Provinces or 
prefectures, cities, and counties in northeastern, northern, 
western, eastern, and south-central regions are practicing 
"state ownership but private operation" for enterprises on a 
large scale, with this percentage at 60 percent for Henan, 43 
percent for Hebei, 20 percent for Anhui, 35 percent for Nanjing, 
60 percent for Chongqing, and 60 percent for Beijing's 
commercial system. This reform has achieved marked success. 
<H5>  V. Property-Rights Transaction Markets </H5>
  Over 20 provinces and more than 10 cities authorized to 
formulate their own plans independently throughout China, such 
as Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, 
Fujian, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Changchun, Shenyang, 
Dalian, Wuhan, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Nanning, 
Kunming, Wuxi, and Lanzhou, have established over 120 
property-rights transaction markets of varying degrees and sizes. 
  As China's property-rights transactions have just now 
started, their volume is still less than 1 percent of the proper 
market access, far below the property-rights transaction 
economies of scale. Analysis estimates that our domestic assets 
in urgent need of turnover amount to 1 trillion yuan, with 30-40 
percent in a state of inefficiency or idle. This shows that 
China's property-rights markets and transactions are in urgent 
need of breakthroughs. 
<H5>  VI. Individual and Private Economies </H5>
  By the end of 1993, China's private enterprises had grown to 
238,000, employing 3.726 million, with registered capital of 
68.05 billion yuan, and annual tax payments (including 
individual industrial and commercial operations) topping 29 
billion yuan. Private enterprises accounted for respectively 4.1 
percent, 18.1 percent, and 7.8 percent of our national 
industrial output value, retail commodity sales, and industrial 
and commercial taxes. Our private-economy industrial structure 
grew steadily more rational, with the percentage of private 
enterprises engaged in tertiary industries at 41.9 percent, of 
which private S&amp;T advisory enterprises grew fastest to number 
3,871, up 220 percent from the same period in 1992. 
  Meanwhile, individual industrial and commercial household 
operations have also grown quickly. By the end of 1993, they had 
grown to 17.67 million throughout China, with registered capital 
of 85.48 billion yuan, employing 29.39 million. In addition, 
China's private S&amp;T enterprises have also shown much 
vitality. 
Incomplete figures show that by the end of 1993, they had topped 
50,000, employing more than 800,000, with gross income from 
technician trade exceeding 25 billion yuan. 
<H5>  VII. Enterprise Mergers and Bankruptcy </H5>
  1. As enterprise mergers began sooner, they have made smooth 
progress. Data for the 1980s show that 25 provinces and cities 
and 13 cities authorized to formulate their own plans 
independently throughout China merged 6,226 enterprises with 
6,906 others, for newly moved stock assets of 8.25 billion yuan, 
reducing losing enterprises by 4,095 and enterprise losses by 
522 million yuan. In the last two years, enterprise mergers have 
been even more successful. By the end of 1993, the number of 
merged enterprises had topped 10,000, cutting down on a large 
group of losing enterprises, and freeing up a large amount of 
idle assets. 
  2. A number of enterprises have been eliminated through 
market competition and gone bankrupt according to law. From the 
time our "Bankruptcy Law" took effect in 1988 through the first 
half of 1993, 356 enterprises went into legal bankruptcy due to 
poor management and longstanding losses, of which 88 were 
state-owned, and 268 were collective and other types of 
enterprises. Enterprise bankruptcy is an inevitable outcome of a 
market economy and the laws of competition. We need to improve 
our dynamics in this area so that, while continuing to set up 
and improve our social security system, we can promote more 
enterprise bankruptcy according to law, and establish as quickly 
as possible bankruptcy mechanisms suited to modern 
market-economy needs. 
<H5>  VIII. Inventorying Assets and Funds </H5>
  The experimental job of inventorying assets and funds 
throughout China began in 1992. By 1993, the experimental scope 
had expanded quickly to 9,401 state enterprises, with 825,000 
administrative-institution units conducting assets checks. These 
checks began to clarify "resources," reinforcing enterprise 
development stamina. After revaluation, the fixed assets of the 
9,401 enterprises appreciated 42 percent, or 180 billion yuan. 
As to the checking of administrative units, by 31 December 1992, 
for 824,496 state administrative-institution units throughout 
China at and above the town and township level (not including 
Shanghai Municipality, enterprises, and military institutions), 
overall verified assets were worth 836.479 billion yuan, up 
143.623 billion yuan from their pre-check book value of 692.856 
billion yuan, or 20.7 percent. Our inventorying of assets and 
funds in 1994 will focus mainly on experiments in converting 
enterprise operating forces, practicing a state-assets oversight 
system, and setting up a modern enterprise system, with the 
number of experimental enterprises kept at about 10,000, mostly 
large and midsize ones. This will include 1,000 enterprises 
experimentally practicing the state-assets oversight system, 100 
experimentally setting up a modern enterprise system, and other 
enterprise experiments in areas, such as incorporation and 
shareholding. 
  As to state-assets property-rights registration, we 
completed 
in 1992 yearly property-rights registration for 1,373 grade-1 
central enterprises, registering state assets worth 891.86 
billion yuan, for state capital worth 634.92 billion yuan. We 
conducted a yearly registration for 15,357 enterprises below 
grade-2 with trustee management by all sectors, registering 
state assets worth 120.6 billion yuan. In addition, we also 
counted state assets. The data for 1992 show state assets 
throughout China worth more than 3 trillion yuan. 
<H5>  IX. The State-Assets Management System </H5>
  1. We have actively conducted comprehensive reform 
experiments of our state-assets management system. To promote 
the separation of government administration from business 
management, sever the administrative subordinate relations 
between enterprises and the government sector, and separate the 
government's administrative functions from its 
state-assets-ownership management functions, in 1992 in Tianjin, 
Shenzhen, Fujian's Quanzhou, and Sichuan's Deyang we first began 
to set up and prepare to set up full-time government management 
organs for state-assets ownership, establishing first in 
Shenzhen and then in Quanzhou city-level state-assets management 
commissions. Shanghai set up in 1993 a state-assets management 
commission. Shenzhen and Quanzhou have also conducted 
experiments in giving property-rights mechanisms access to 
enterprises, in which experimental enterprises set up ownership 
representative-agency boards of directors, to practice the 
president responsibility system under the leadership of a board 
of directors. 
  2. We have conducted experiments in establishing 
investment-management and special property-management companies 
subordinate to the State Administration of state property 
sector. Data from some provinces, cities, and regions show that 
by the end of 1992, 36 such companies had been set up. Cities, 
such as Shenzhen, Beijing, and Qingdao, have also set up special 
state-property management companies. Qingdao has removed its No 
1 Light Industry Bureau, establishing the Qingdao Yiqing 
Industrial Corp to specially manage its state property. This 
corporation is commissioned by the municipal government to 
manage the state-enterprise assets of the former No 1 Light 
Industry Bureau, having used operations, such as investment, 
shareholding, mergers, joint operations, compensated transfers, 
assets transfers, and joint and contractual joint ventures, to 
optimize its industrial structure and product mix, achieving 
assets appreciation and profit maximization. 
  3. We have conducted reform experiments in authorized 
management of state property. In April 1993, the state set eight 
enterprise groups as China's first batch of 
authorized-management experiments for state property, in which 
the State Administration of State Property sector uniformly 
authorized the enterprise groups' core enterprises to manage the 
state property of their closely integrated member enterprises, 
establishing a property-rights link between the core enterprises 
and their closely-integrated members, making the core enterprise 
the enterprise group's parent company, and the closely 
integrated members its subsidiaries, to achieve group 
management, and bring overall advantages into full play. 
  4. State-property evaluation organs are essentially 
established, with evaluation services beginning to form up. 
Incomplete figures since 1990 show that there are now over 1,000 
evaluation organs qualified for assets evaluation and authorized 
at the provincial level and above, with staffs of nearly 20,000. 
By June 1993, over 22,000 assets evaluations had been conducted 
throughout China, with the evaluated assets having an original 
book value of 290 billion yuan, and a net book value of 230 
billion yuan, which appreciated to 360 billion yuan after 
evaluation, for an average appreciation rate of 57 percent. 
<H5>  X. Legal Establishment </H5>
  Since reform and opening, China has drawn up and put into 
effect a series of laws and regulations concerning 
property-rights system-reform. We are now preparing to draw up 
others, such as a state property law, a shareholding-cooperation 
enterprise law, a real estate law, a stock law, an auction law, 
and a wholly foreign-owned enterprise law.

<F P=106> [Article by Bai Yingzi (4101 5391 1217), the State Economic </F>
and Trade Commission's Enterprise Corporation: "100 
Pilot-Project Enterprises Engage in Key Endeavor To Set Up a 
Modern Enterprise System"] 
  [Text] A modern enterprise system is one that is suited to 
the needs of our socialist market economy, based on perfecting 
our enterprise incorporation system, characterized by a system 
of limited liability, and uses the main form of incorporated 
enterprises. The "CPC Central Committee Resolution on Certain 
Issues Involved in Establishing a Socialist Market Economy" 
passed by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee points out that: "A modern enterprise system dominated 
by public ownership is the grounds for our socialist market 
economy." "As establishing a modern enterprise system is a 
necessary requirement for developing socialized large-scale 
production and a market economy, it is China's state-enterprise 
reform direction." To implement this "Resolution" of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the State 
Council has decided to choose 100 state enterprises as pilot 
units for practicing a modern enterprise system, charging the 
pertinent departments, such as the State Economic and Trade 
Commission and the State System Reform Commission, with the job 
of drawing up specific plans and organizing their implementation. 
<H5>  I. Establishing a Modern Enterprise System Was Our </H5>
Inevitable Option for State-Enterprise Reform 
  Ever since China began to reform and open up, 
state-enterprise reform has held the central position in 
national economic reform, remaining our whole economic-reform 
priority and difficulty. This reform has adopted measures, such 
as profit commissions, conversion from profits to taxes in two 
steps, and the contract system, making a certain amount of 
progress in expanding enterprise decisionmaking power, and 
increasing enterprise operating vitality to a certain extent. 
And the putting into effect of the "Enterprise Law" and the 
"Forces-Conversion Regulations" has further promoted the 
implementation of enterprise decisionmaking power, laying the 
grounds for enterprise market access. But state-enterprise 
reform measures are still essentially the outcome of the 
authority-devolution and profit-concession ideology, not yet 
having involved an upgrading of our traditional enterprise 
system under our planned economic system per se, with 
longstanding state-enterprise problems, such as no separation 
between government administration and business management, 
unclear property rights, no enterprise autonomy, and unsound 
self-restraint forces, never having been essentially solved, 
leaving state-enterprise vitality obviously still relatively 
inadequate, enterprise activities hard to standardize, and 
economic efficiency less than ideal. The facts prove that 
further intensification of reform will mean resolving deeper 
conflicts, by adjusting the policy of mainly devolving authority 
and conceding profits to the creation of an enterprise system 
characterized mostly by clear property-rights relations, and 
through exploring effective ways to combine our state economy 
with a market economy, to find new ways for running state 
enterprises better. 
  A modern enterprise system using the main form of company 
incorporation has four obvious features: 1. Property-rights 
relations are clear, effectively achieving the separation of 
investor's ownership rights from enterprise corporation property 
rights. 2. The relations between rights and liabilities are 
clear, with enterprises having corporate assets, giving them the 
right of independent decisionmaking, while reinforcing their 
liabilities for their own profits and losses and for preserving 
and multiplying the capital put up by investors. 3. The 
establishment and operation of corporate ruling bodies, such as 
shareholder meetings, boards of directors, executive 
departments, and boards of supervisors, forms balance and 
restraint forces to regulate the relations among owners, 
corporate delegates, operators, and employee collectives. 4. It 
contributes to fundraising, creating a good form for expanding 
production scale and achieving capital socialization. So 
reorganizing state enterprises into modern incorporated 
companies paves the way for cutting the umbilical cord between 
government administration and business management, rationalizing 
state-assets property relations, and genuinely converting the 
operating forces of state enterprises. 
<H5>  II. The Planning and Methodology Involved in Choosing 100 </H5>
State Enterprises as Pilot Units for a Modern Enterprise System 
  The "Resolution" points out that: "As the establishment of a 
modern enterprise system will be a difficult and complex task, 
we will need to accumulate experience, create conditions, and 
proceed gradually." "Having state enterprises practice a 
corporate system will be a valuable exploration in the 
establishment of a modern enterprise system." The enterprise 
practice of a corporate system will be not simply a change of 
name, but rather an emphasis on converting forces, "which will 
proceed gradually through pilot units, with absolutely no 
formalism or precipitate action." To ensure that the pilot 
units proceed effectively, the pertinent departments, such as 
the State Economic and Trade Commission and the State System 
Reform Commission, have drawn up detailed plans and methods for 
the 100 pilot enterprises. 
<H5>  1. The Pilot-Unit Goals </H5>
  The goals to be reached through pilot units are: To search 
for effective ways to combine public ownership with a market 
economy, spurring enterprises to convert their operating forces, 
improving economic efficiency, and further freeing up and 
developing the productive forces; to explore ways to separate 
administrative and business functions, enabling enterprises to 
thoroughly break free from their status as subsidiaries to 
government administrative bodies, with the government not 
directly involved in enterprise production and operation 
activities, so that enterprises can truely gain access to 
markets and make their own operating decisions based on market 
demand; to accumulate experience for rationalizing property 
rights relations, establishing enterprise corporate property 
rights, enabling enterprises to become genuine corporate 
entities enjoying civil rights and charged with civil 
liabilities, and consolidating the capabilities of civil rights 
and actions, to conscientiously achieve liability for profits 
and losses; to perfect the leadership and organizational 
management systems within enterprises, advancing in the 
direction of standardization and more scientific, to evolve 
clear rights and liabilities, unity and cooperation, and mututal 
restraint forces within enterprises. 
<H5>  2. The Pilot-Enterprise Selection </H5>
  The selection of pilot enterprises was based on the 
following 
principles and terms: 1. As to enterprise size, it was mostly 
large and medium-size state enterprises, focused particularly on 
aging enterprises in urgent need of technological upgrading; 2. 
As to enterprise qualifications, it included the best, the 
intermediate, and the worst, mostly enterprises that better 
implemented the "Forces-Conversion Regulations," had leading 
bodies of higher quality, and had better economic efficiency, 
along with an appropriate selection of a few losing enterprises 
in line with state industrial policy; 3. As to industrial 
distribution, it was mostly industrial, commercial, and trade 
enterprises, with an appropriate selection of enterprises in 
other industries, such as transportation, construction, and 
high-tech; 4. As to regional distribution, it was mostly 
enterprises in regions and cities where market forces had 
developed faster and external conditions were better, with an 
appropriate selection of enterprises from other regions; 5. As 
to form of enterprise organization, it was mainly enterprises 
that had not conducted corporate reorganization, along with the 
selection of a few enterprises that were already corporations 
for standardization. 
<H5>  3. The Key Substance of Enterprise Reorganization to </H5>
Corporations 
<H5>  A. Perfecting the Enterprise Incorporation System </H5>
  The pilot enterprises had to first act in accordance with 
the 
relevant state provisions, by inventorying their assets and 
funds, delimiting their property rights, liquidating their 
bonded debts, evaluating their assets, verifying their 
enterprise corporate assets possession, and checking their 
capital funds. 
  Capital contributors exercise assets ownership, enjoying 
legal shareholding rights in line with the percentage of shares 
held, such as asset income, and major decisionmaking and 
selection management, having limited liability to the enterprise 
based on capital contributed. Capital contributors are not 
directly involved in specific enterprise operations, being 
unable to directly budget corporate assets or withdraw assets or 
shares, but able to sell in accordance with law. 
  Enterprises hold corporate property rights, independently 
enjoying civil rights and accepting civil responsibilities for 
all corporate assets, with legally independent decisionmaking 
power and liability for profits and losses, and charged with the 
liability to capital contributors for preserving and multiplying 
assets (capital). As independent corporate entities and market 
competitors, enterprises no longer have administrative 
subsidiary relations with government organs, no longer being 
ranked indiscriminately. 
<H5>  B. Determining Enterprise's State-Assets Investors </H5>
  In line with the principle of separating the government's 
socio-economic management function from its state-assets 
ownership function, the state-authorized investment organ or 
state-authorized department is the state-assets investor, 
legally exercizing stock-rights management of state assets in 
enterprises. As to enterprises in which it is currently hard to 
determine the state-assets investor, the government can 
authorize a certain department to act as state-assets investor, 
to exercise state stock rights. The organs responsible for 
state-assets management in state-authorized investment organs or 
state-authorized departments do not perform any government 
administrative functions for enterprises in which they hold 
shares. 
<H5>  C. Setting the Form of Enterprise Corporate Organization </H5>
  In line with the principle of graded guidance, enterprises 
that produce certain special products or those in designated 
industries should be reorganized as wholly state-owned 
corporations; most enterprises should be reorganized as limited 
liability companies; qualified ones can be reorganized as 
limited-liability companies, with only a few to be listed; while 
national industrial head offices can be reorganized as state 
holding companies, they should not generally operate as one 
company to monopolize a whole industry; enterprise groups are 
reorganized according to their parent-company systems. 
  Reorganizing state enterprises into limited-liability 
companies in which multiple shareholders hold stocks is the 
focus of the corporate reorganization. This can be achieved 
through ways, such as converting creditor rights to stock 
rights, attracting foreign-investment shareholders, investment 
in shareholding among enterprises, and absorbing some 
institutional and fund investment into shareholding. Qualified 
enterprises can experiment with standardized employee 
shareholding. 
<H5>  D. Establishing a Scientific and Standardized Corporate </H5>
Administrative Structure 
  Based on the principles of separation but mutual restraint 
among the rights, operating, and oversight structures and 
capability and efficiency, we have formed a corporate 
administrative structure composed of shareholder meetings, 
boards of directors, boards of supervisors, and managers, 
ensuring clear rights and responsibilities, with each performing 
their own functions, to effectively exercise decisionmaking, 
oversight, and executive authority. 
  The shareholder meeting is the company's highest organ of 
authority. State-authorized investment organs or departments and 
other capital contributors select delegates to take part in 
shareholder meetings and exercise authority according to law. 
  The board of directors is the company's operating-decision 
body. Boards of directors are elected by shareholder meetings, 
with shareholders recommending candidates, which become members 
of boards of directors acccording to legal procedures, to be 
liable to all shareholders. The board chairman is the company's 
legal representative. 
  The manager is hired or fired by the board of directors, 
with 
no direct hiring or firing by government administrative organs 
or shareholder meetings. Managers are responsible to boards of 
directors, entrusted by company charters and boards of directors 
with all responsibility for the company's regular production and 
operating management. 
  The board of supervisors is the company's oversight agency, 
responsible to the shareholders convention. Boards of 
supervisors are made up of shareholder representatives and a 
suitable percentage of company-employee delegates, produced 
through democratic elections by company employees. Board, 
manager, and financial officers may not serve concurrently on 
boards of supervisors.

<F P=106> [Report by the Price Research Institute's Forecasting Group </F>
(Principal researcher: Chen Dejun (7115 1795 1415); co-drafters: 
Cao Jianjun (2580 1696 6511), Liu Xuming (0491 2485 2494) and 
Ling Bin (0407 1755)): "Basic Estimates of Price Trend in 1994"] 
  [Text] I. Basic Situation in Economic Growth and 
Price Trends in 1993 
  In 1993, China achieved notable results in economic 
construction: compared to 1992, GNP increased by 13 percent, per 
capita GNP exceeded 2,500 yuan, estimated increase in 
agricultural output value in constant price increased by 3.7 
percent, total grain production reached 456.4 billion kilo and 
total oil production 176.1 billion tons. Total industrial output 
value in constant price increased by 19.5 percent. Citizens 
income also increased. Adjusted for the price factor, the 
estimated annual per capita income of urban residents increased 
by 10 percent, and of peasants by about 2 percent. Total 
personal savings exceeded 300 billion yuan. The market was 
active, and the total value of consumer goods retail sales, 
adjusted for price rises, increased by 9 percent in real terms. 
The total value of 1993 exports approached $190 billion, an 
increase of around 15 percent over 1992. 
  Despite the favorable figures cited above, China's economy 
also contains numerous salient contradictions, and the newly 
created contradictions combined with the long-standing ones have 
led to sharp rise in the overall price level in 1993, exerting a 
great impact on functions of the economy in 1994. In 1993, the 
national retail price index increased by 13 percent over the 
prior year, with increases in prices of a range of consumer 
products including import products, in costs of labor and in 
production materials. After mid-July as a result of the 
macroeconomic controls exercised by the Central Government, the 
overall price level and prices of some important production 
materials began to show some decline. But after November, the 
inflationary trend was again strengthened. The fourth quarter 
price situation was particularly serious. With the living cost 
index rising in the large and medium cities, reaction of 
low-income citizens and university and middle school students 
was particularly adverse. Increase in prices of agricultural 
production materials exceeded prices of agricultural products, 
creating unfavorable conditions for agricultural exchanges in 
the rural areas. Given the overall price increases, however, 
price levels of energy, rail transportation, certain basic 
products and infrastructure facilities were still low. 
  The main reasons this type of situation has developed are as 
follows: 
  1. Development of infrastructure enterprises is 
sluggish and out of step with general economic development. 
  Development in China's infrastructure enterprises, energy, 
transport and transportation has been lagging, and the situation 
still had not improved by 1993. Year-end 1993 statistics 
indicate that rail transport capacity increased by only 3 
percent over the prior year. Basically no new rail lines have 
been put in service in 1994, and inadequate rail transport has 
been one of the most critical areas in the last several years. 
The Electric Power Ministry estimates that China at present 
suffers an overall 20 percent shortfall in electricity supply, 
with shortage in the Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan area of 8 
billion watts, the Northeast region 3-5 billion watts, while 
East China historically has a shortage of electricity. Based on 
China's realistic needs, the elasticity coefficient for 
electricity should be greater than 1.2, but in actuality it 
averages only 0.95. Although the overall quantitative supply of 
coal and charcoal can be considered in equilibrium relative to 
demand, but affected by transportation shortfall, the coal 
supply for economically developed areas in East China and South 
China is still tight. The demand for steel can only be met by 
large imports and by the importing enterprises bearing added 
transshipment costs. Rapid economic development has created 
strong demands for basic products and infrastructure facilities 
which led directly to increased market prices of basic products; 
and because higher cost of supplies add to costs of production, 
it provides strong impetus for overall price increase. 
  2. Supply-demand dislocation as a result of imperfect 
market structure and inefficient circulation channels. 
  Circulation of commercial products in China is disjointed 
often because of sluggish information flow, monopoly, 
territorial division and untimely supply organization. For 
example, in late November 1993, Guangdong led off with major 
grain price increases, which gradually affected prices in areas 
such as Hubei, Hunan, Anhui and Jiangxi, and soon enough the 
North, producing grain price fluctuations over a large area. In 
reality, China's total grain supply was adequate and reserves 
also ample, but supply shortage in grain trading departments in 
some areas and untimely grain transport to meet shortfalls in 
other areas resulted in grain supply-demand disequilibrium in 
various markets which could not be remedied [with supplies 
distributed] in a timely way. 
  3. Inadequate supply to meet market demand is 
underlying anxiety of an active market economy. 
  Rapid economic growth and significant price increases 
demonstrate that demand is strong and the market active. But the 
underlying situation is one of lagging market supply to meet 
demand for certain products; for example, the demand for textile 
products is sluggish while demand for household electrical 
products well satisfied, or the supply of cement is such that 
reserves for a whole year amount to some 210 billion tons. 
Warehousing of products by state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises continues to increase, and the total warehouse 
reserves by year end is estimated to increase by over 12 percent 
compared to the prior year. In particular, because peasants 
income increase has lagged in recent years, sales in rural 
markets of agricultural production materials have been sluggish, 
and low demands for products of rural industries will affect the 
latter's ability to recover from the slump. In terms of the 
projected expanding scope of industrial production, this is an 
underlying danger. 
  4. While money in circulation is already excessive, a 
situation of inadequate liquidity to settle accounts still 
exists. 
  Since 1992, money in circulation has increased by close to 
40 
percent in each of the two succeeding years. In this same 
period, the economy grew by 27 percent, and prices increased by 
19 percent. The rate of increase in money supply is almost 
greater than the above two rates combined. Yet in many areas, 
liquidity is still quite a problem, and triangular debts of 
enterprises appear to be rising. Excessive amount of money in 
circulation is a serious threat in that it leads to further 
price inflation while inadequate liquidity for settling accounts 
generates pressure for additional infusion of money supply. 
<H5>  II. Analysis and Projection of Price Situation in the First </H5>
Half of 1994 
  Based on operating condition of the national economy in 1993 
and factoring in economic development and reform in 1994, it is 
estimated that the scenario in the first half of 1994 will still 
be one of high growth and high inflation, with the economic 
growth rate basically keeping in step with rate of price 
increase, both at probably more than 10 percent, but the 
possibility exists that the latter may increase faster than the 
former. The reasons for prices increasing faster are: 
  1. Tail-end effect of 1993 price inflation. 
  While the economic growth rate stayed at 13 percent in 1993, 
the overall urban living costs index reached 15 percent, while 
the index for 35 large and medium-sized cities exceeded 20 
percent. Based on calculations, the residual effect of last 
year's price inflation on this year's retail price level amounts 
to 4-5 percentage points. 
  2. Large infusion of money supply creating underlying 
inflationary pressure. 
  The out-of-control infusion of money supply in the first 
half 
of 1993 was curbed by macroeconomic coordination measures 
applied after July, but money in circulation was still 
excessive, and with further infusion of large amounts of money 
supply in the second half of 1993, the year-end monetary 
reserves of specialized banks reached a total of around 180 
billion yuan; at present, money on deposits in banks has doubled 
compared to the amount in July last year, a substantial amount 
of liquidity which fuels demands. By the end of 1993, the total 
amount of money in circulation had increased four-fold compared 
to the end of 1992. In 1994, the Peoples' Bank of China's policy 
on new money supply is based on the projection of a rather high 
economic growth rate of 9 percent and new money of some 470 
billion yuan, an increase of 17.8 percent. Therefore, the 
projected supply of new money will generate great pressure on 
market prices. 
  3. Imbalance in large-scale investments and enterprise 
structure remains a major impetus for price inflation. 
  Although the total of China's fixed assets investments has 
declined somewhat after "macroeconomic coordination," but the 
rate of increase in 1993 was still over 46 percent. It is 
estimated that with the changing production focus, state-owned 
enterprises will have a surplus capacity of some 1,440 billion 
yuan this year, a 40 percent increase over the year before; 
furthermore, due to regulations designed to facilitate 
development of the "bottleneck" enterprises, plans made to 
substantially increase investments in newly defined key projects 
and to utilize foreign capital investment in domestic 
facilities, it is projected that this year's total fixed assets 
investments will reach 1,300 billion yuan, an increase of 13 
percent over the year before, and very possibly exceeding the 
1993 total amount. Along with imbalance in large-scale 
investments, China's enterprise structure also lacks balance; in 
particular, infrastructure enterprises are thinly capitalized 
and weak, restraining increase in supplies of energy and 
resource materials, and contributing to widening the 
supply-demand gap. Therefore, a rising price level becomes 
necessary to generate increase in supplies. 
  4. Economic structural reform and its underlying effect 
on price reform. 
  Among the numerous economic structural reforms carried out 
this year, the most important ones which potentially impact on 
the overall price level include reforms of the systems of 
exchange rate, taxation and price structure. Regularization of 
exchange rate has facilitated foreign exchange access for 
domestic enterprises, but for the same reason can generate 
greater imports into China this year and lead to increase in the 
cost basis of the enterprise products. Although in reforming the 
tax system, efforts are made not to increase the tax burden of 
enterprises, but changes in the tax structure will inevitably 
bring about changes in the tax burdens of individual enterprise. 
The value added tax [VAT] will add to the tax burden of 
wholesale enterprises, but lessen the tax burden of retail 
enterprises. In addition, the VAT will be collected this year 
from previously untaxed trades such as grain, chemical 
fertilizers, medicine, hogs and energy resources. Structural 
adjustments of prices will concentrate mainly in grain, oil, 
rail transportation etc., which will undoubtedly and directly 
result in market price increases. 
  5. Structural changes in salaries, wages and 
consumptions will also lead to rise in the consumers price 
index. 
  In recent years, citizens income level has risen 
considerably. Statistics indicate that in January-November 1993, 
the total value of all wages and salaries nationally increased 
by 21.8 percent over the same period of the year before; of the 
total, wages paid by people's work units increased by 21.9 
percent, rural or collective economic entities by 15.1 percent, 
and other economic entities by 73.5 percent which represents an 
all-time high in historical terms. Non-wage income of workers 
and employees also reached a considerably high level. And the 
increased cost of labor is another important factor which drives 
up the cost of production and leads to price increase. Even more 
serious is the structural change in income. A typical study 
shows that at present 2 percent of the citizens have 30 percent 
of all income. Correspondingly, the market for consumer products 
is leaning toward the higher priced luxury products. A 2,000 
yuan leather jacket is no longer considered a rarity. Demands of 
soap and cosmetic are for the imports or high-class products of 
foreign-funded enterprises; hot-selling products and others 
items rapidly becoming hot-selling products include motorcycle, 
air-conditioner, video-camcorder, camera, computer, stereo audio 
system, multi-feature color TV, refrigerator, telephone and 
other communications devices. These high-price consumers 
products are also setting the standard and exerting strong 
attraction for the middle and lower income groups. Therefore, 
although the overall market demand of consumers goods will not 
produce great changes, changes in the income structure and the 
structure of consumer goods market will exert upward pressure on 
consumers product prices. 
  6. Imperfect organization of market enables some 
products to create market and price fluctuation at any time 
  Markets in China are small-scale and loosely organized; 
supply and sales channels of many important commercial products 
are uncoordinated and disjointed, and monopolies in some markets 
and regional barriers are also rather serious problems. 
Therefore, in terms of maintaining overall market equilibrium in 
supply and demand for products, responses to certain policy 
measures or changes in psychological expectation can lead to a 
certain amount of market and price fluctuations. If such 
fluctuations occur regularly, prices will naturally react by 
strong upward movement. 
<H5>  III. Analysis of Whole-Year Price Trend in 1994 and Policy </H5>
Recommendations 
  Viewed in the context of current economic condition and 
reform and opening in China, it is inevitable that the overall 
price level will rise substantially in 1994. Examined in terms 
of how the trend may develop, two scenarios in the latter half 
of 1994 are possible: 1) Given intensification of economic 
structural reform and strengthening of macroeconomic controls, 
abnormal price fluctuations and price increases will be 
effectively controlled, and the overall rate of price increase 
will be kept in line with the national economic growth rate. 2) 
With the economy growing rapidly and double-digit inflation 
continuing its upward climb which lead to forceful adjustment in 
the economy, the result will be slowing down the rate of 
economic growth, but the two factors accounting for price rise 
have not been eliminated and prices will continue to rise 
creating the so-called slow growth with high inflation scenario. 
The effect of slow growth on prices is very serious; the effect 
of high inflation is also dangerous. 
  In order to prevent more serious inflation from taking 
place, 
controlling the overall price level should be one of the 
objectives of macroeconomic policy; therefore, the following 
policy or reform measures are recommended for consideration: 
  1. Maintain stable growth of the money supply. 
  China's monetary policy should strive to stabilize the money 
supply. Considering the fact that money in circulation is 
already excessive, the rate of increasing the money supply 
should be kept within the range of the combined rates of 
economic growth and planned price increases; at the most, the 
rate should not exceed last year's rate of increasing the money 
supply. 
  2. Strictly control increased supply and demand for 
investment capital 
  Controlling the demand for investment capital ultimately is 
done by reforming the investment and other economic systems. The 
current reform has not reached that stage, and government 
administrative coordination is still required. It is important 
that investment projects of different kinds or types be governed 
by different fiscal and taxation policies; commercially 
competitive projects with relatively high rate of returns should 
be required to pay higher market interest rates and higher tax 
rates; infrastructure projects requiring a longer time frame to 
yield relatively low returns should be given lower interest 
rates for commercial loans and paying lower taxes; for 
investments in public interest projects with low or no returns, 
the government should not only extend low interest special 
loans, but also encourage such investments through preferential 
policy treatments. In addition, the government should guide and 
coordinate the level of investments by various enterprises in 
different localities on the basis of the latter's developmental 
status. 
  3. Establish and perfect macroeconomic market 
coordination including tactics for indirect coordination. 
  To prevent abnormally large fluctuations in the commercial 
market, the government should focus on establishing a series of 
wholesale markets for agricultural sideline products and 
materials for industrial productions in the large and 
medium-sized cities and localities where such products and 
materials are usually assembled and distributed. On the basis of 
such a foundation, the government should target products with 
different special characteristics and apply different direct or 
indirect macroeconomic coordinating measures. (1) Products with 
limited supply-demand elasticity such as grain, cotton, sugar, 
salt, agricultural pesticides and plastic film covering, the 
government should apply macroeconomic policy with a "guarantee 
supply" objective. The government must resolutely set up, in 
stages and by category, a storage and reserves system for 
important products, and realistically put into effect a fund for 
adjustment of special projects. The sales of these products and 
their stable supply in the market should be linked to 
enterprises being required to maintain reserves at a level 
within the range of government stipulated highest and lowest 
levels of reserves, and to follow government guidance in times 
of market fluctuations. (2) For industrial products with more 
flexible supply-demand elasticity, the government should 
emphasize establishment and standardization of wholesale 
markets, and as much as possible utilize economic measures to 
limit price fluctuations and, when necessary, reactivate the 
system of registering quoted prices. (3) Where industrial 
production materials dictate market supply and demand, the 
government should regularly fine tune macroeconomic measures 
such as monetary, fiscal and taxation policies, and exercise 
macroeconomic coordination as planned or when required. 
  4. Vigorously develop and expand rural markets. 
  In developing rural markets, in addition to leading 
enterprises to produce products which will sell in rural areas, 
the most important objective is to raise the peasants income. On 
the one hand, the government should adopt the policy of 
protecting and supporting agricultural product prices, but on 
the other hand, it needs to continue to encourage and foster 
development of rural enterprises and speed up the transfer of 
agricultural surplus labor to other pursuits. At the same time, 
we should give overall preferential treatment to agricultural 
investment. 
  5. Open up multiple investment channels and lead 
citizens to increase savings for various investments, and reduce 
demand pressure for hot-selling consumer products on the 
market. 
  At present, the most important step is to create conditions 
for citizens to save and invest in housing. The Government 
should further open up areas of financial investment so that 
citizens can channel their money from consumption into 
productive investment. Real estate reform should quickly help 
implement the objective of facilitating citizens buying their 
homes.

<F P=106> [Report by Dong Jialin (5516 1367 2651), director of the </F>
regional planning commission: "Implementation of 1993 Economic 
and Social Development Plan and Draft Plan for 1994"] 
  [Excerpts] 1. Economic and Social Development in 
1993: Basic Situation 
  Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory about building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the 
party's 14th National Congress, people of all nationalities in 
the province worked hard to deepen reform, broaden the open 
policy, and accelerate development in 1993. There were 
remarkable achievements in all areas of economic and social 
development. 
  1) Economic Development Reaches New Level; Structural 
Adjustment Scores New Progress 
  Gross output value stood at 9.65 billion yuan for the entire 
year, up 10 percent, a gain of 2.5 percentage points over last 
year and higher than the goal of 9 percent set at the beginning 
of the year. Specifically, the primary industry grew 5.5 
percent, the secondary industry 12.9 percent, and the tertiary 
industry 9.5 percent. The rural economy developed across the 
board. Grain output for all 1993 reached 2.03 billion kilograms, 
104.3 percent of the target and a historic high. There was a 
substantial increase in acreage planted with barley, assorted 
legumes, soybean, vegetables, herbal medicines, and tobacco, 
which are highly sought after on the market and fetch good 
prices. Township and town enterprises continued their strong 
momentum, their gross output value hitting 3.05 billion yuan for 
the year as a whole, up 42.8 percent from the preceding year. 
Industrial output rose steadily, expanding by 3.65 billion yuan, 
a gain of 12.8 percent over a year ago. (Gross industrial output 
value stood at 12.08 billion yuan, up 13.9 percent.) Heavy 
industry, particularly metallurgy and the building materials 
industry, grew substantially. Nonstate industry expanded more 
rapidly than state industry. Enterprises enjoyed higher margins 
of profit. Among industrial products, the production to sales 
ratio climbed from 95.4 percent to 97.6 percent, the profit to 
funds ratio from 5 to 6.5 percent, and the working capital 
circulation rate from 1.3 to 1.4 times. The combined 
profitability index of industrial enterprises that practiced 
independent accounting hit 76.6 percent, 10 percentage points 
higher than 1992. Enterprises in the building industry found 
themselves in an improved position and completed an additional 
850 million yuan worth of projects, or up 13.3 percent over last 
year. Potential was tapped in the transportation and posts and 
telecommunications industries. Railroads, highways, and 
airplanes carried 5.8 percent more cargo than in the preceding 
year, while the volume of business in the posts and 
telecommunications industry rose 53.4 percent. 
  2) Key Areas Report New Achievements; New Projects Completed 
  Fixed assets investment in all society totaled 5.16 billion 
yuan, up 35.5 percent, or 12.5 percent after adjusting for 
inflation. This includes the 3.37 billion yuan in local fixed 
assets investment, 131.2 percent of the target in the plan for 
the year, up 27.1 percent from a year ago, or 4.1 percent after 
adjusting for inflation. Of the total local fixed assets 
investment, capital construction investment by state units 
amounted to 2.59 billion yuan, and another 900 million yuan went 
to modernization and transformation. The overwhelming majority 
of key projects proceeded smoothly. Among national priority 
projects, all work on bridges, culverts, and tunnels relating to 
railroad construction has been completed. The double-tracking of 
the 62-kilometer Zhongwei-Gantang railroad was completed and the 
line has now been put into service. Among the region's own 
priority projects, the construction of the mine and rotary kiln 
in the second phase of the expansion of Ningxia cement plant was 
completed; they went into trial production last October. Work 
was essentially completed on the pumping station at the 
Yanhuanding project, trial operation has begun for some parts of 
the project, irrigating 21,400 mu for winter last year. These 
are some of the major projects completed last year: the 
transformation of the Yinchuan chemical fertilizer plant, the 
expansion of Ningxia coking factory, the Ningxia ferro-alloy 
plant, the resin plant at Qingtong gorge, steel cable workshop 
at the Shizuishan steel plant, Xiji vermicelli plant, Zhongwei 
modern building materials plant, Ningxia ferric oxide plant, the 
coal mine in Pingluo county, Guyuan granary, and centralized 
heating in county towns like Yanci and Pingluo, centralized 
supply of heat to Yanci, Pingluo, and other county towns, No 2 
waterworks in the old city of Yinchuan, the expansion of the 
capacity of the telephone systems in Yinchuan, Taole, Pangyang, 
and Xiji, distance-programmed telephone projects in Shizuishan, 
Qingtong Gorge, Zhongwei, and Pingluo, and the highway from 
Rujigou mine to the opening of the ravine for the transportation 
of coal. 
  3) New Strides Made in Reform-Deepening; New Developments in 
Broadening the Policy of Opening to Outside World 
  Rural reform continued to deepen. The transformation of the 
operating mechanism of state enterprises became more 
thoroughgoing. Rapid progress was made in the reform of the 
property rights system. Multiple economies continued to take 
shape. The number of private enterprises and individual 
industrial and commercial households rose 50.4 percent and 19.8 
percent, respectively, from a year ago. The entire economy 
became more market-oriented. The market for every commodity 
continued to expand. New progress was made in the development of 
the markets for capital goods like finance, securities, and real 
estate. The implementation of Document 6 of the CPC Central 
Committee and the effort to tighten macroeconomic regulation and 
control have been remarkably successful; the once disorderly 
financial market has changed markedly for the better. 
Region-wide 427 million yuan in loans that were illegally or 
improperly made were recovered. The reserve fund rate of the 
various specialized banks increased from 3.4 percent in July to 
over 10 percent by year end. 
  The open policy continued to be broadened on all fronts 
across the board. Exports last year totalled $111.24 million, 
approaching last year's level, including $74.71 million worth of 
goods exported by the localities themselves, up 11.6 percent 
from the previous year. A total of $36.66 million in foreign 
capital was utilized during the year, an increase of 260 percent 
from 1992, and 181 enterprises funded by the three kinds of 
foreign capital were approved in all of 1993. 
  4) New Achievements in All Social Undertakings; Improvements 
in People's Living Standards 
  There was a total of 257 scientific and technological 
[S&amp;T] 
achievements above the provincial or ministerial level in all 
1993 and 168 patents were granted. In rural areas, 
yield-increasing technologies including ton-grain technology, 
high-yield paddy farming technology, the transformation of 
low-yield land, and dry crop agriculture were introduced over 
large areas. Altogether 4.6 million mu were brought under 
cultivation using the new technologies. Eighteen new crop 
varieties were selected and submitted for approval. On the 
industrial front, a host of new technologies, new products, and 
new processes were developed. The vertical cement mechanical 
kiln, electromagnetic bridge crane, and ATC cam knife-shifting 
equipment, among others, were put into production with fairly 
good economic results. ' Institutions of higher education in the 
autonomous region admitted 3,378 students in 1993, up 24 percent 
from a year ago, and secondary specialized schools admitted 
4,397, up 16.6 percent. At the elementary school level, 95.2 
percent of school-age children were in school, up from 94.6 
percent in 1992. The "231" project was further implemented. 
Region-wide, the number of illiterates dropped by 48,800 
people, and the two counties of Pingluo and Zhongwei inspected 
and accepted the anti-illiteracy campaign organized by the 
autonomous region. 
  A variety of social undertakings continued to make progress. 
  Urban and rural household incomes continued to increase. The 
per capita income in urban areas was 1,907 yuan, up 304 yuan 
from a year ago or 3.3 percent after adjusting for inflation. 
Per capita net income among peasants was 667 yuan, up 48 yuan 
from last year, but actually unchanged from a year ago after 
adjusting for inflation. The market was booming, with social 
commodity retail sales for the year reaching 4.3 billion yuan, 
up 15.4 percent from last year. According to sample surveys, the 
natural population growth rate for the year was 14.07 per 
thousand, down 0.068 per thousand from a year ago. The region's 
total population stood at 4,953,000 at year end, 37,000 fewer 
than projected. 
  Even as the region's economy chalked up new achievements 
last 
year, there were some outstanding problems and contradictions, 
primarily overly rapid price increases. The overall price index 
for the year was 12.8 percent, and the household living expenses 
price index jumped 14. percent, significantly higher than the 
target set at the beginning of the year. Funds and rail 
transportation continued to have considerable "bottleneck" 
effects on the economy. Times were tough for a number of state 
enterprises. The amount of losses was significant and the number 
of money-losing enterprises high. 
  2. 1994 Economic and Social Development Plan: Major Targets 
and Tasks 
  Nineteen ninety-four is a critical year for the completion 
of 
the Eighth Five-Year Plan. It is also crucial for the push to 
create a socialist market economy. Grasping the opportunity, 
deepening reform, expediting development, and maintaining 
stability...such is the keynote for region-wide work. The design 
and implementation of the 1994 regional economic and social 
development plan should adhere to this keynote and contribute to 
it. It must be guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory about 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and be 
thoroughly true to the spirit of the 3d Plenum of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee and the 2d meeting of the 8th National 
People's Congress. The plan should further liberate our 
thinking, promote reform all round, expand the open policy, and 
strive to adjust the structure and raise profitability. It 
should take bold solid steps toward creating the basic framework 
for a socialist market economy, spur the steady, rapid, and 
healthy development of the national economy, and fuel social 
progress all round. 
  Based on these demands, the principal targets of the 1994 
regional economic and social development plan are: 
  -- Gross regional output should reach 11.4 billion yuan, up 
9 
percent over 1993 in constant prices. The primary industry is 
projected to grow 4 percent, the secondary industry 9 percent, 
and the tertiary industry 13 percent. 
  -- Fixed assets investment in all society should be 4.77 
billion yuan, up 9.4 percent in constant prices, including 1.38 
billion yuan in capital construction investment by local state 
units, 750 million yuan in technological transformation, and 1.1 
billion yuan in collective and individual investment. 
  -- Local revenue should reach 602.49 million yuan, up 9.8 
percent in constant prices, after the tax separation system is 
introduced. 
  -- Exports should reach $105 million, imports $70 million. 
The amount of foreign capital utilized is estimated at $35.5 
million. 
  -- Social commodity retail sales should grow 14 percent to 
reach 4.9 billion yuan. 
  -- Overall retail prices should rise no more than 10 percent 
or so. 
  -- Work hard to improve profitability. The energy 
conservation rate, the rate of sales of finished products, and 
the circulation of working capital must all go up. The ratio of 
unprofitable enterprises must be brought down 5 percentage 
points, while the amount of losses should be trimmed by 10 
percent. 
  -- The natural population growth rate should be contained 
below 14.4 per thousand. Total population at year end is 
projected to reach 5.02 million. 
  These are the major tasks of economic and social development 
for 1994: 
  1) Make Agriculture the Top Priority Steadfastly, Spur Rural 
Economic Development Across the Board 
  Grain output is projected to total 1.9 billion kilograms in 
1994; oil-bearing crops, 70 million kilograms; beet, 600,000 
tons; fruit, 130 million kilograms; meat, 83 million kilograms; 
and aquatic products, 150,000 tons. The gross output value of 
township and town enterprises will reach 3,664,000,000 yuan, up 
20.3 percent. Peasants' net incomes will be 720 yuan per capita, 
53 yuan more than the year before. We should concentrate on 
doing a good job in these areas: 1) Intensify the adjustment of 
the rural industrial structure. As far as grain crops are 
concerned, we should grow more beer-producing barley, legumes, 
corn, and buckwheat As for cash crops, we should expand the 
planting of beet, hops, asparagus, chili, and man-made licorice 
root. In forestry, we should tackle the development of 
second-generation high standard farmland and forest belt in the 
Huangguan region and the comprehensive treatment of desertified 
areas. Moreover, we should continue to develop commercial 
orchards and commercial forests. Turning to the animal husbandry 
industry, efforts should be made to raise beef cattle, sheep 
that produce mutton and wool, and pigs that produce lean pork. 
2) Build up a host of agricultural commodity production bases. 
Develop an agriculture that is high-yield, high-efficiency, and 
good-quality. In addition to creating various agricultural 
byproducts commodity bases already planned, we should build 16 
high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficiency agricultural 
demonstration zones of all types across the entire region. 3) 
Step up the development of the agricultural infrastructure to 
enhance agriculture's lasting power. Continue to tackle the 
Huang He treatment project. Complete Phase 1 of the irrigation 
expansion project funded by the World Bank. Launch Project 4071 
in the three counties including Guyuan which was funded by the 
World Food Program and designed to fight poverty and 
environment. The Huang He Daliushu key water control project, 
long-hoped-for by the people in the region, has been included in 
the "National Program for Agricultural Development in the 
1990's" adopted by the State Council. It has also made its way 
into the list of projects, the fourth batch so far, approved by 
the State Council that may be considered for receiving loans 
from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan. This year 
we should concentrate our energies on reviewing and approving 
the necessary documents, drawing up the migration plan, and 
repaving the roads on site. Also we need to continue to tackle 
with diligence preliminary work for the Liupanshan water 
diversification project, the Xingren water pumping project, the 
Shabotou key water control project, and the remaking of another 
irrigated area in the Hetao region. 4) Further accelerate the 
development of township and town enterprises. Push for the 
adoption of the shareholding cooperative system vigorously. 
Increase inputs in township and town enterprise through various 
channels and at all levels. Import technology and attract 
qualified personnel to come to Ningxia. Expand lateral economic 
and technical cooperation both within Ningxia and between the 
region and other places. Improve the overall quality of township 
and town enterprises. Step up planning and guide township and 
town enterprises to achieve the right degree of concentration. 
Fully utilize and transform existing small towns and build new 
ones. Strive for breakthroughs on all these fronts this year. 5) 
Do a good job in poverty relief and development. The autonomous 
region should concentrate on putting to good use funds like the 
"three xi" and "work in lieu of loans." Work hard to secure 
other anti-poverty development funds from the central 
government. Targeting the impoverished areas, we must win the 
war on poverty. Beginning this year, the regional planning 
commission will work together with a number of mountainous 
counties to design an anti-poverty strategic plan. 
  2) Keep Output in Industry and Transportation Growing at a 
Steady Pace While Raising Profitability. 
  These are the projected outputs for the major industrial 
products in 1994, taking into account market demand and 
production capacity: coal, 13 million tons; electricity 
generation, 9.1 billion kilowatt-hours; aluminum, 85,000 tons; 
ferro-alloy, 125,000 tons; cement, 1.4 million tons; chemical 
fertilizers (net amount), 330,000 tons; tires, 1.3 million sets, 
bearings, 1.9 million sets; machine tools, 2,280; machine-made 
paper and cardboard, 120,000 tons; sugar, 40,000 tons; and 
cigarettes, 53,000 crates. The profit to investment ratio of 
industrial enterprises is projected to rise to 7 percent, up 
from 6.5 percent a year ago. The turnover rate of working 
capital was 1.45 times, up from 1.4 times in the previous year. 
Overall labor productivity and the profit to costs ratio are 
also projected to continue to go up. 
  Stopping enterprises from losing money and increasing their 
profits must be tackled as a major task this year. Intensify the 
responsibility system to stem losses and increase profits. 
Turning-losses-into-profits targets should be handed down from 
level to level all the way to the grass roots and enterprises. 
There should be evaluation at fixed intervals. Rewards and 
penalties should be meted out at year end. Ningxia should 
concentrate on stemming the losses of enterprises run by the 
region whose losses exceed 2 million yuan each and making major 
enterprises whose profits top 5 million yuan each even more 
profitable. At the same time, give priority to energy 
conservation work in high-energy-consumption enterprises. 
  Further overhaul our thinking and liberalize our policies. 
Be 
supportive of nonstate enterprises when it comes to credit and 
transportation, etc. 
  To spur the adjustment of the industrial structure and boost 
the staying power of development, we must continue to tackle 
industrial capital construction projects and technological 
transformation projects now under way aggressively so that they 
pay economic dividends as soon as possible. In the energy 
industry, the focus is on building the Lingwu mine and 
completing the No 1 well at Yangchang Wan. No time should be 
wasted in completing track-laying on the Dagu feeder railway. 
Begin construction on the power plant in the second phase of 
Daba power plant project. Continue construction on the Hexi 
headwork power station at Qingtong Gorge. Build the 
Sanying-Haiyuan and Yinchuan-Helan 110 kilovolt power 
transformation and transmission works. In raw materials 
industry, complete the expansion of the second phase of Ningxia 
cement works, the transformation of Qingtong Gorge cement plant, 
the heavy oil catalytic cracking transformation of Ningxia oil 
refinery, and the energy consumption project at the Shizuishan 
steel works. Tackle preliminary work on these projects: phase 
three of Qingtong Gorge aluminum plant, the natural gas 
pipeline, the transformation of Ningxia chemical industrial 
plant, and the transmission of electricity from Ningxia to other 
provinces. Turning to the processing industry, complete a host 
of technological transformation projects, including those at 
Xibei bearing plant, the Yinchuan electric wire plant, the 
Yinchuan dacron plant, and the Dahe machine tool plant. Complete 
the expansion of Zhongwei paper-making plant and 5233 plant. 
Begin construction on the deadweight meridian tire project at 
the Yinchuan rubber plant, the 500,000-set spherical roller 
bearing project at the Xibei bearing plant, the Ningxia 
fermentation plant, the Shizuishan sanitary porcelain works, the 
Yinchuan metallic magnesium plant, and the Ningxia 
pharmaceutical plant. 
  Turning to transportation and posts and telecommunications, 
continue to coordinate with the central government's plan to 
accelerate the transformation of Baozhong Railway and Baolan 
Railway and the construction of Jinghu Yinlan, Xilanwu Class 1 
guanglan main lines. Complete the construction of the Yingu 
Highway and Yinchuan Huang He Bridge. Start construction on 
Yinchuan Hedong Airport. Begin the expansion of the handling 
capacity of the municipal telephone system of Yinchuan to 30,000 
lines. Begin phases two and three of the mobile communications 
project. Proceed with the program-controlled telephone projects 
in such cities and counties as Yongning and Helan. 
  3) Maintain Investment on a Sensible Scale; Further 
Accelerate Key Projects 
  Social fixed assets investment for the entire region is 
projected to reach 4.77 billion yuan (excluding Baozhong Railway 
and Changqing oil-field), up 9.4 percent from the preceding 
year. Specifically, investment by state units will total 3.67 
billion yuan, up 10 percent, and investment by collectives and 
individuals, 1.1 billion yuan, up 7.3 percent. Of all investment 
by state units, 2.27 billion yuan (1.38 billion yuan from local 
governments and 890 million yuan from the central government) 
will go to capital construction; 1 billion yuan (750 million 
yuan from local governments and 250 million yuan from the 
center) will go to technological transformation, 285 million 
yuan will go to real estate development, and 150 million yuan 
will be invested in other projects. 
  Of all capital construction investment by local state units, 
local governments have tentatively allocated 60 million yuan in 
their budgets, lending by the various banks in the region will 
amount to 250 million yuan, the head office of the Construction 
Bank will make available 136 million yuan in special loans, and 
various central ministries and commissions will chip in with 87 
million yuan. In addition, 180 million yuan will come from 
special funds like those of electricity, transportation, and 
posts and telecommunications; 5.4 million yuan from the energy 
and transportation fund; 29 million yuan from the special 
agricultural fund under the region's finance department; 14 
million yuan from the "three xi" fund; 175 million yuan in funds 
raised by the sectors, municipalities, and counties themselves; 
104 million yuan in foreign capital, 108 million yuan in funds 
raised through the issue of bonds, etc., and 40 million yuan in 
other funds. 
  Continue to make a success of the technological 
transformation of existing enterprises, particularly large and 
mid-sized state enterprises. Continue to implement the 
"doubling" plan in key enterprises. In technological 
transformation projects, limit the share of investment in local 
products and import more technology. Modernize equipment and 
develop new products. 
  Eleven projects have been designated as key national and 
autonomous regional construction projects for 1994. Among key 
national construction projects are the Lingwu mine and Baozhong 
Railway. Among key regional construction projects are the 
following: Yinchuan Hedong airport, Yanhuanding water-pumping 
project, phase two of Daba power plant, Yinchuan dairy products 
factory, Yingu Highway (including Yinchuan Huang He Bridge), 
Ningxia tourist hotel, the expansion of the handling capacity of 
the Yinchuan municipal telephone system, the transformation of 
Yinchuan rubber plant, and the expansion of Xibei bearing plant. 
Eight projects have been designated as key preliminary work in 
the region: Daliushu key water conservancy project, Liupanshan 
river diversion project, Xingren water-pumping, phase three 
expansion of Qingtong gorge aluminum plant, expansion of Ningxia 
chemical industrial plant, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia natural gas 
pipeline, Guyuan cement plant, and the Aerda imitation silk 
project, a Sino-Indonesian joint venture. 
  4) Grasp Opportunity To Further Open Up to Outside World 
  Fully capitalize on the existing favorable opportunity to 
increase exports and foreign exchange earnings. Even as Ningxia 
continues to do well with traditional staple exports, it must 
strive to develop new flagship exports. The export sector should 
be given preferential treatment when it comes to obtaining bank 
credits and securing rail transportation. Promptly give 
qualified enterprises the authority to handle foreign trade on 
their own. Make use of the region's coastal areas as window to 
the outside world. Go all out to open up and develop an 
international market. After a unitary system is introduced in 
foreign exchange, the autonomous region will no longer control 
or issue to lower levels a foreign exchange distribution plan. 
The state imposes quota management on 26 commodities and applies 
an automatic registration system to some commodities which are 
sensitive on the domestic market. As for other commodities, it 
will be up to the enterprises themselves to organize their 
importation. 
  Continue to utilize foreign loans extensively and 
effectively, using most of them to finance the transformation of 
large- and medium-sized state enterprises and the autonomous 
region's key construction projects. Our plan calls for the 
utilization of $18.48 million in foreign loans in all 1994, 
including $8.48 million in foreign loans taken out by the state 
and $10 million international commercial loans. Tighten foreign 
debt management. Adhere to the rule that the borrower must also 
be the repayer and put an end to the present situation in which 
borrowing is often dissociated from repaying. Further improve 
the investment climate. Continue to attract direct foreign 
investment in a variety of ways. Direct foreign investment is 
estimated at $17 million for 1994. In accordance with the 
industrial policies of the state and the region, we should steer 
even more foreign capital to foreign-exchange-earning 
industries, infrastructural projects, basic industries, other 
projects using advanced technology, and the technological 
transformation of existing enterprises. Actively spur the 
development of the "three kinds of enterprises either wholly or 
partially funded by foreign capital," making them more upscale 
and enabling them to operate at a higher level and on a larger 
scale. Increase the percentage of foreign capital that actually 
materializes. 
  5) Steer Economic Construction Onto the Path of Relying on 
S&amp;T Progress In Earnest; Further Develop Education 
  The autonomous region is set to tackle 37 key S&amp;T 
projects 
and 17 S&amp;T dissemination projects in 1994. In agricultural 
S&amp;T, 
the main focus should shift from exclusively pursuing quantity 
to pursuing both an increase in quantity and an improvement in 
product quality and to increasing the value of commodities. 
Accelerate the introduction of better varieties of cash crops 
and step up research on their farming technology. Intensify 
research into the processing technology of famous, high-quality, 
and unique agricultural byproducts. Put together a host of 
S&amp;T 
demonstration projects. In the short haul, we should concentrate 
on research in mulberry cultivation and silkworm raising, 
man-made licorice, and tobacco cultivation. Actively promote 
technological advances in industrial enterprises. Strongly 
encourage them to set up research and development offices. 
Import and absorb applicable technology extensively. Accelerate 
the transformation of traditional industries using new 
technology. Continue to develop new integrated electronic 
products and research new materials technology. It is proposed 
that enterprises join forces with institutions of higher 
education and scientific research units to set up a variety of 
organizations of technology development. 
  Institutions of higher education and secondary specialized 
schools will admit 2,500 and 4,400 students, respectively, 
throughout the autonomous region in 1994. Increase the 
proportion of self-financed students as appropriate in 
accordance with a plan. Continue to diversify and increase the 
channels of educational funding. Compulsory education should 
primarily be funded by local governments. Encourage society to 
raise and pool funds for education in a variety of ways. 
Encourage private education. Make a success of "Project Hope," 
which aims to solicit educational donations for the mountainous 
areas in the south. Make vocational education and adult 
education more attuned to the demands of the market. Capitalize 
on the enthusiasm of all quarters in society for education. 
Continue with "Project 231." 
  6) Continue To Improve People's Lives and Develop 
Miscellaneous Social Undertakings 
  With the economy developing and social productivity rising, 
we should continue to improve the people's living standard. By 
developing the rural economy across the board and raising the 
prices of grain and beet by an appropriate margin, we must work 
hard to boost peasants' incomes substantially. As output expands 
and profitability rises, state enterprises should raise their 
workers' wages correspondingly. Take pains to implement wage 
reform in units and institutions carefully and meticulously. Be 
solicitous about the livelihood of retired personnel, workers in 
troubled enterprises, and peasants in impoverished areas. 
Vigorously push ahead with the commercialization of urban 
housing and expedite housing construction. Accelerate the reform 
of the social security system. Continue to improve facilities 
that play an intimate part in the daily lives of the people: 
urban water supply system, roads, liquefied gas supply, etc. 
Actively develop cultural undertakings, publishing, radio and 
television broadcasting, public health, and sports. Increase 
investment in a variety of ways and through diversified channels 
to improve the infrastructure of social development. Continue to 
tackle family planning work successfully, focusing on rural 
areas and the floating population and going all out to keep the 
natural population increase rate below the target in the plan.

<F P=106> [Article by Gao Shixing (7559 0013 2502): "New Tax System </F>
Will Further Promote Development of China's Petroleum Resources"] 
  [Text] In 1979 China began to cooperate with foreign 
countries in the extraction of its petroleum resources, and for 
more than 10 years over 50 foreign petroleum companies have come 
to China to participate in the extraction of its petroleum 
resources. To meet China's need for foreign cooperation in the 
extraction of petroleum resources, China follows international 
practice by drawing on the experience of some of the world's 
petroleum-producing countries and by constantly perfecting and 
enriching China's tax policy for foreign cooperation in 
petroleum as well as its laws and regulations. China has 
initially formed a set of regulations for foreign cooperation in 
petroleum that contain clear measures, which play an important 
role in attracting foreign capital and promoting the prospecting 
and exploration of petroleum resources. In 1991 China completed 
the reform of its income tax system for enterprises in which 
foreign businessmen had invested and for foreign enterprises. At 
the end of 1993 China carried out the largest reform of its tax 
system since the founding of the PRC, with the focus on 
reforming the circulation tax and on reforming the income tax on 
domestic venture enterprises and individuals. For China's 
petroleum corporations and foreign petroleum corporations, the 
main point was the abolishing of the consolidated industry and 
commerce tax and the changes in the collection of the value 
added tax, business tax, and consumption tax. 
  To maintain the continuity and stability of the tax policy, 
so that it is more advantageous to attracting foreign capital 
and promoting the opening up to the outside world, the Fifth 
Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee passed the 
"Decision on Provisional Regulations for Value Added Tax, 
Consumption Tax, and Business Tax on Enterprises in Which 
Foreign Businessmen Have Invested and on Foreign Enterprises." 
On the basis of this decision the State Council issued a "Notice 
on Provisional Regulations for Value Added Tax, Consumption Tax, 
and Business Tax on Enterprises in Which Foreign Businessmen 
Have Invested and on Foreign Enterprises." In the decision and 
notice, provisions were specially made for the tax issue with 
regard to Sino-foreign cooperation in the extraction of 
petroleum resources, the main parts being: "The collection in 
kind of the value added tax on petroleum and natural gas 
extracted from Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas) fields is at a 
rate of 5 percent; and, in line with the existing stipulated 
collection of the mining area use fee, the value added tax will 
temporarily not be collected, and when the value added tax is 
being calculated there will be no deduction on the income tax. 
When crude oil or natural gas is exported, there will be no 
drawback. The oil (gas) fields at sea exploited by the China 
National Offshore Oil Corporation will be run in accordance with 
the abovementioned stipulations." 
  The stipulated tax preference is mainly embodied in: 
  1. The industry and commerce consolidated tax on crude oil 
and natural gas extracted in Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas) 
fields has been changed to a value added tax, but the tax in 
kind will continue to be collected. A tax in kind on crude oil 
and natural gas is not exclusive to China, but rather is the 
current practice of the main petroleum-producing countries of 
the world. Mainly out of consideration that petroleum is a major 
source of energy, the governments of petroleum-producing 
countries should, through tax measures, control part of the 
petroleum reserves. Now, because of the output of Sino-foreign 
cooperative oil (gas) fields, the tax in kind on crude oil is 
entrusted to the cooperative oil (gas) fields for selling in a 
lump and putting in storage according to the actual sales value. 
The principle of collection of a tax in kind is understood and 
accepted by Chinese and foreign petroleum companies. 
  2. After the value added tax was put into effect, its rate 
on 
crude oil was 17 percent and its rate on natural gas was 13 
percent. In order not to increase the tax burden on Chinese and 
foreign petroleum companies because of the tax system reform, 
the State Council notice decided that the value added tax on 
crude oil and natural gas extracted in the Sino-foreign 
cooperative oil (gas) fields and those at sea would be at a rate 
of 5 percent. This decision has three advantages for the Chinese 
and foreign petroleum companies: 
  One advantage is that it is consistent with the principle of 
China's circulation tax at the 5 percent level on petroleum 
resources extracted by foreign countries. This principle has 
been accepted by Chinese and foreign petroleum companies, and it 
has become an important provision in the petroleum contracts 
signed by the Chinese and foreign sides. The second advantage is 
that, under the new tax system, when crude oil and natural gas, 
on which there is a tax rate of 5 percent, is sold domestically, 
because objectively the funds held by the bying side are reduced 
(mainly the funds held by the buying side for income tax, the 
crude oil and natural gas of the Sino-foreign cooperative oil 
(gas) fields and those at sea possess a superiority in the price 
aspect. The third advantage is that, because likewise there is 
no drawback on the export of crude oil, the crude oil of the 
Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas) fields and those at sea only 
bear 5 percent of the circulation tax, and before the crude oil 
is exported it bears 17 percent of the domestic circulation tax, 
the Chinese and foreign petroleumn companies possess competitive 
strength in the export of crude oil. 
  3. Still according to the existing stipulated collection of 
the mining area use fee, the natural resources tax will 
temporarily not be levied. The levying of a mining area use fee 
confirms to international practice, and it is accepted by 
Chinese and foreign petroleum companies. China's collection of 
the mining area use fee is at an above-quota graduated fee rate; 
at-sea oil (gas) fields in which the annual crude oil total 
output does not exceed 1 million tons and the annual natural gas 
total output does not exceed 2 billion are exempt from the 
mining area use fee. The main purpose of this exemption is to 
encourage the development of small oil (gas) fields at sea and 
to formulate special policies for them. Similarly, for a 
medium-sized oilfield at sea that has an annual output of 1 
million tons, if the mining area use fee is levied but 
temporarily the natural resources tax is not levied, then it 
possesses the advanatage that the Chinese and foreign petroleum 
companies at this field will get every year a small sum of money 
to help pay the 8 million-yuan tax. 
  Summarizing what has been said above, because in the past a 
preferential tax policy was given to Chinese and foreign 
petroleum companies, including the continued retention of 
import-export and other preferential policies, the Chinese and 
foreign petroleum companies will not, because of this reform of 
the tax system, have their tax burden increased; conversely, 
because the tax system reform makes China's tax system more 
rational, the fact that the level of collection management is 
constantly rising and the tax preferences are becoming more 
marked is bound to further promote the opening of China's sea 
and land petroleum resources.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhao Haikuan (6392 3189 1401): "Transforming </F>
State Banks Into Commercial Banks"] 
  [Text] True to the spirit of the 3d Plenum of the 14th CPC 
National Congress, the goal of future financial reform in China 
is to establish a financial system that can operate smoothly in 
a socialist market economy. In such a financial system, every 
financial institution is internally driven to succeed, to 
reform, and to forge ahead. Externally, financial institutions 
are under enormous competitive pressure from other institutions 
to go forward. There is also a macroeconomic regulatory and 
control mechanism that both serves as an effective restraint and 
spurs microeconomic activities. 
  To achieve the above-stated goal as soon as possible, we 
must 
decide carefully what to do in hopes of making a breakthrough. 
The 3d Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee has done just 
that for us and it is to further regularize the functions and 
systems of the central bank, establish a policy-oriented bank, 
and gradually transform existing large state banks into 
commercial banks after turning over the policy-based business to 
the policy-oriented bank. The core issue here is the 
commercialization of large state banks. It is a major part of 
the deepening of financial reform in China in the days ahead. 
<H5>  What Are Commercial Banks? </H5>
  A commercial bank is a financial enterprise that buys and 
sells the right to use funds like a commodity, pursues profit as 
its principal objective, exercises decision-making authority in 
its operations, is accountable for its profits and losses, 
assumes risk on its own, and has a self-discipline mechanism. 
  It is the thrust of reform to turn all financial 
institutions 
in China into commercial financial institutions as defined 
above, with the exception of the central bank and 
policy-oriented banks. As a matter of fact, so far large and 
small shareholding banks, urban and rural credit societies, and 
small and medium-sized state banks such as Zhongxin Industrial 
Bank and Guangdai Bank have basically become this kind of 
financial institutions. Even large state banks have begun the 
transition to commercialization and are expected to complete the 
process in the next few years. Meanwhile, the commercial 
financial institutions mentioned above will evolve into typical 
or representative commercial financial institutions. New urban 
and rural cooperative banks and other financial institutions 
will be set up. Foreign-funded financial institutions are also 
slated for a period of rapid growth. By then China's financial 
system will basically have everything a modern banking system 
ought to have. 
  Compared to the existing large state banks, the typical 
commercial bank has the following features: 
  1) Buys and sells financial services and the right to use 
credit funds like a commodity. 
  In the past the government treated large state banks as the 
implementors of policies and managers of the economy. How much 
money the banks should lend and to whom were both decided by the 
government. After these banks became commercial banks, both the 
financial services they can provide and the right to use funds 
became commodities. Will a bank provide services and lend money 
to a particular enterprise? How much? Questions like these will 
now be answered by the bank and the enterprise themselves 
through discussion. When the business of making policy-mandated 
loans is turned over to the policy-oriented bank, commercial 
banks will be absolved of the responsibility of supplying 
enterprises with working capital. No longer will they be held 
accountable for the difficulties faced by mismanaged and 
unprofitable enterprises whose products do not sell well after 
their application for a loan is turned down. In most cases the 
government also will stop directly ordering a commercial bank to 
extend credit to a certain enterprise. It would no longer be 
proper for the government to continue using simple 
administrative tools to control their business activities. 
Instead it should adopt policies to create an environment 
conducive to banks doing business based on their own 
self-interests. 
  2) Profit enhancement as one of the principal operational 
objectives 
  All enterprises must make a profit. In a socialist market 
economy, the enterprise which does not make a profit cannot 
survive for long. As a financial enterprise, a commercial bank 
must have a well-defined profit objective and must organize and 
mobilize all its employees to work hard to achieve that 
objective. The profit motive is the engine that drives all its 
operations. Whether or not an enterprise truly regards the 
numerical profit objective as its primary operational goal 
essentially distinguishes a state commercial bank from its 
predecessor, a large state bank. 
  Will a commercial bank do any less social good if it looks 
upon profit or economic return as its principal operational 
goal? The answer is that not only will it not do less social 
good, but it may on the contrary generate more social benefits. 
A bank realizes its social good through its business activities. 
The purpose of allowing a bank to assess its own bottom line is 
precisely to enable it to put its business on a sounder footing. 
When a commercial bank becomes more successful in its business, 
when idle funds in society are put to full use, when the bank is 
able to lend more loans with the projected economic return and 
provide more financial services for the economy, then the 
economic benefits to society and hence to the entire nation will 
automatically be even greater. 
  When large state banks go commercial, they become state 
commercial banks. As state commercial banks, they should no 
doubt comply with national laws and policies in an exemplary 
manner, particularly those in the field of finance. They must 
look at the bottom line without, however, being preoccupied with 
profit-making exclusively. The problem now is that the profit 
motive of these banks is not strong enough. We need to further 
liberate our thinking and take measures to intensify it. 
  3) Linking workers' earnings to the bank's financial 
performance 
  After a large state bank is transformed into a commercial 
bank, its employees' earnings should be linked to its 
performance. If the bank is well-managed and its profit goes up, 
so should the incomes of its employees correspondingly. If the 
bank is mismanaged and its profit drops, perhaps even replaced 
by a loss, the earnings of its workers should likewise decrease. 
This is an important way to fully energize a commercial bank, a 
measure essential to making the bank internally driven and 
externally pressured and turning it into a truly modern 
financial enterprise. However, how a bank's bottom line is 
linked to workers' incomes is something that needs to be 
examined carefully. In the future, after the banks' profit 
becomes average profit, we should take a leaf from the book of 
the typical large enterprise and work out a commercial bank wage 
and incentive system closely linked to a bank's margin of 
profit. That way the earnings of a bank's employees will be even 
more in line with its profitability. 
  4) Adopting a new internal management system 
  Large state banks and commercial banks are two different 
kinds of banks with different operating mechanisms. Naturally 
their management systems are also different. After a large state 
bank is transformed into a commercial bank, the first order of 
business is to craft a management system that meets the needs of 
a commercial bank. Such a system should include an operations 
management system, a financial management, and a personnel 
management system, etc. A personnel management system, for 
instance, should comprise a strict employee performance 
evaluation system complete with rewards and penalties in order 
to put a total end to the phenomenon of good workers and bad 
workers being treated in the same way. The bank president should 
be granted the power to hire and fire employees. The "iron rice 
bowl" should be smashed in the course of time. 
<H5>  Business Operations Of Commercial Banks </H5>
  The operations of a commercial bank can be summed up in a 
traditional way as "deposit, lend, and remit." Deposit means 
accepting deposits, lend means making loans, and remitting means 
sending remittances, or, as they put it loosely, "account 
transfer and settlement." 
  Deposits. Under state regulations, a commercial bank derives 
its funds from the capital invested by its owner. It is also 
entitled to take a predetermined percentage of the funds in its 
account transfer and settlement line of business in accordance 
with the principle of "accept payment first, make payment 
later." Yet another source of funds is deposits. While there is 
a numerical ceiling to the first two sources of funds, deposits 
have enormous potential for growth. As long as a bank is making 
all the right moves and works hard, deposits can keep growing 
strongly. Thus deposits often represent the principal source of 
funds for a commercial bank. Take Zhongxin Industrial Bank, for 
instance. In 1992 its liabilities and net assets amounted to 
33,587,740,000 yuan, including 19,858,550,000 yuan, or 59.1 
percent, in deposits. 
  How much money a commercial bank lends and hence the overall 
scale of its operations is determined by the sources of its 
funds. For this reason a commercial bank typically takes 
deposits most seriously. Commercial banks offer the same kinds 
of deposits plans and methods that large state banks have 
offered for years. As competition heats up, however, they will 
come up with an endless range of innovative practices and 
programs and keep improving their services. Interest rates too 
will become more flexible and elastic within the limits set by 
the state. 
  If they meet the requirements, commercial banks can also 
raise funds by issuing bonds. Issuing bonds in essence resembles 
taking deposits, which is why it is mentioned as part deposits 
here. 
  Making loans. Lending is the principal way in which a 
commercial bank puts funds to use and the primary source of its 
profits. Let us again look at the situation in Zhongxin 
Industrial Bank in late 1992. Its credit balance stood at 
19,395,380,000 yuan, 57.8 percent of the total amount of funds 
applied. Since commercial banks assume risk themselves and are 
accountable for their own profits and losses, they normally 
select whom they lend money to most stringently, limiting their 
borrowers to those enterprises whose products are popular and 
relatively profitable and which are well managed. Pre-lending 
investigations and post-lending supervision are also major 
priorities for a commercial bank. Among the various kinds of 
loans, the proportion of unsecured loans has been dropping while 
that of secured loans and discounting of bills has gone up. Each 
and every single loan comes with a specified time limit; it must 
be paid off by the due date. 
  The amount of lending by a commercial bank is no longer 
determined by the national credit plan or other administrative 
tools. However, the bank must practice assets to liabilities 
ratio management and submit to the restraint of fund sources so 
as to ensure that it is fully able to pay its depositors. In 
other words, whatever the circumstances, whenever a depositor 
demands to withdraw a sum of money, the bank must have the money 
on hand to make such a payment. 
  Commercial banks are required to purchase a set amount of 
treasury bonds, but whether they should be allowed to buy 
enterprise bonds and shares has yet to be considered. Countries 
like the United States do not permit commercial banks to 
purchase shares and bonds as a form of investment, while just 
the opposite is true in Germany and Switzerland. Most people in 
China are opposed to commercial banks purchasing enterprise 
bonds and shares. Under the "Decision of the State Council 
Concerning Financial Reform," "state commercial banks shall not 
invest in non-financial enterprises." In my opinion, commercial 
banks as a rule should not be allowed to purchase enterprise 
bonds and shares for fear of over-extending the use of funds and 
causing a credit crisis and to prevent the stock market and bond 
market from undermining bank credit. However, in the course of 
converting state enterprises into modern enterprises, we should 
allow a portion of the old bad debts to be converted into shares 
to be held by the loan-originating bank. 
  Account transfer and settlement. This is what a commercial 
bank does when loans are paid off, labor fees paid, and other 
sums transferred in society. Since account settlement and 
transfer involves various banks, uniform methods of settlement 
must be established by the central bank. By going into the 
account transfer and settlement business, a bank can collect a 
service charge or take a cut of the sum settled, on the one 
hand, and attract customers to open an account with it, thus 
boosting its deposits, on the other. (Before a bank would do 
transfer and settlement for you, you must deposit a sum of money 
there.) For this reason, account transfer and settlement is a 
fiercely competitive part of a bank's business. Competition 
helps shorten the settlement process, improve customer services, 
and accelerate economic development. 
  The central bank must do a good job in public inter-bank 
lending and note settlement. Commercial banks should be 
authorized to handle inter-bank account settlement within their 
own system on their own. Nevertheless, account settlement 
between different banking systems and between the branches of 
banks that are either unwilling or unable to set up a banking 
system should go through the public banking group organized by 
the central bank. Note settlement too should be processed by the 
central bank or by a bank designated by the central bank. 
  Account transfer and settlement by a commercial bank will be 
more service-oriented and freer from administrative supervision 
compared with similar services offered by the large state bank 
of the past. The bank can only do what the two parties--the 
payer and the payee--agree upon. The payer and the payee, on the 
other hand, will each play a stronger role in disciplining 
itself and monitoring the other party. Say an enterprise asks a 
bank to collect a sum of money. If the other enterprise refuses 
to pay, all the bank can do is to return the commission. It will 
then be up to the two enterprises to arrive at an agreement 
through discussion. 
  Banks should be allowed to overlap one another's scope of 
business. That way enterprises can choose banks and vice versa, 
thus achieving genuine competition in the field of banking. When 
that comes to pass, enterprises which make popular marketable 
products and are well managed and profitable can borrow on 
favorable terms, enabling them to develop even faster. In 
contrast, enterprises whose products fail to move on the market 
and which are poorly managed and are barely profitable or even 
downright unprofitable are either denied credit or forced to 
borrow on harsher terms, This will prompt them to move quickly 
to turn themselves around. 
<H5>  Difficulties in Bank Commercialization </H5>
  Although the course of changing large state banks into 
commercial banks is now set, a number of sticking points remain. 
It will be some time before the conversion process is fully 
complete. Among the major problems are: 
  1) It is difficult to find a substitute for banks as the 
sole 
source of enterprise working capital any time soon. 
  For years state enterprises relied solely on bank loans as 
the source of their working capital. Bank loans account for 80 
percent of the working capital of all state enterprises in the 
nation. At the moment one-third of state enterprises are losing 
money openly while another one-third are doing so under the 
surface. They are bad credit risks. If commercial banks decide 
whether or not to extend credit strictly in accordance with the 
principles of commercial banking, a large proportion of 
enterprises will not qualify and should be denied new loans, 
even told to pay off old loans. But if that really happens, 
these enterprises will have to go out of business. This is not 
just an economic issue, but also a major political issue. Nobody 
says this is what banks should do and it is not something the 
banks themselves dare to do. 
  2) We have yet to figure out what to do about the bad debt 
inherited from the past. 
  Of the current loans of the several leading state banks, not 
a few are essentially uncollectible. They include bad debt the 
material base for which is no longer existent; they are still on 
the books only because the accounts have not been audited and 
losses reported. Others represent the minimum amount of funds 
necessary for the survival of an enterprise. The money should 
have come from the enterprise's capital, but since the capital 
was not there, bank loans were resorted to as a substitute. As 
long as the enterprise continues to exist, there is simply no 
way the money involved can be freed up. That is to say, there is 
little hope the loan will be repaid. 
  How much do these essentially unrepayable loans amount to? 
There is no precise number, but some people have estimated them 
at 40 percent of the value of all loans at least. They 
constitute a burden on the banks as well as the enterprises. The 
debtor state enterprises not only have the obligation of paying 
off the loans, but they are also required to pay interest. 
Saddled with such a burden, how can they enter the market and 
compete with private enterprises, individual enterprises, and 
foreign-funded enterprises that are practically debt-free? For 
large state banks, being stuck with so many uncollectible loans, 
including some which are about to be written off, naturally also 
constitutes a burden. As long as this problem remains unsolved, 
large state banks will be unable to enter the market unburdened, 
ready to compete with other financial institutions on a level 
playing field. 
<H5>  Measures to Spur Bank Commercialization </H5>
  The transformation of large state banks into commercial 
banks 
is a pivotal measure in China's drive to deepen financial 
reform. Since the course is set, we should embark on the process 
steadily and firmly. 
  1) Unify ideological understanding 
  True to the spirit of the "Decision," it is now our set 
policy to deepen reform, energize banking, and establish a new 
financial system suited to the needs of a socialist market 
economy. However, as long as large state banks are not converted 
into commercial banks with despatch and their operating 
mechanism overhauled thoroughly, the banking industry will 
remain dormant and a new financial system will have a hard time 
coming into existence. Should large state banks continue to 
operate by the old mechanism, they will suffer setbacks and 
perhaps even a gradual decline in their competition with other 
financial institutions, losing their original commanding place 
in the banking industry. This is a crucial issue with 
implications for the continued leadership of state financial 
institutions in the entire banking industry. Thus it is not a 
question of whether large state banks are willing to go 
commercial. Rather they must do so as soon as possible. The last 
thing the central bank and all large state banks should do is to 
hesitate and waver. Instead they must be determined to take 
effective measures to effect this transformation over time. 
  2) Work hard to expedite the materialization of a modern 
enterprise system. 
  Banking is a comprehensive sector whose every activity is 
closely related to the enterprise. Banking reform must proceed 
in tandem with enterprise reform, a point thoroughly 
demonstrated by the two difficulties described above. Clearly, 
if we fail to set up a modern enterprise system and continue the 
operating mechanism of the product economy, the numerous 
money-losing enterprises will not be able to turn themselves 
around. Nor can we let them go bankrupt simply because there are 
so many of them. The only thing they can do is to survive on 
bank loans. Under the circumstances, it will be impossible to 
cut back on new loans, not to mention collect old ones. How then 
can we even begin to talk about transforming state banks into 
commercial banks? On the other hand, we cannot just sit here and 
wait for the materialization of a modern enterprise system 
before moving to commercialize large state banks. Whenever 
possible, we should start taking small steps in such areas as 
credit and account settlement to build up a momentum for 
creating a modern enterprise system. When the latter process 
picks up steam, in turn driving the transformation of banks, we 
can then quicken the pace of bank transformation. 
  3) Accelerate the creation of an operating mechanism for 
commercial banks. 
  Waste no time in ending from bottom to top some of the 
institutions and practices formed in the era of the product 
economy and gradually develop a new set of systems such as a 
personnel management system, a fund or business system, and a 
financial system, suited to the operations of commercial banks. 
Creating these systems is tantamount to deepening financial 
reform. We must liberate our thinking and have the courage to 
emulate some of the practices of banks in the West. Actually 
that is what we have been doing and the results have been quite 
satisfactory. We should go further on that front in the future. 
  4) Take feasible measures to solve the problem of bad debt. 
  Considering every practical circumstance, we may take the 
following actions to wrestle with the banks' bad debt problem. 
  a) If the debtor enterprise has decided to turn itself into 
a 
shareholding state enterprise, the debt may be reconstituted as 
the bank's investment in the enterprise, in effect turning the 
IOU into shares. The bank will then cease to be a creditor. 
Instead it becomes a shareholder and takes part in managing and 
supervising the enterprise. 
  b) Some enterprises do not meet the requirements for the 
transformation into shareholding enterprises for the moment but 
may do so in the future. In this case, we may convert the loan 
into transferable bonds, that is, turning it into enterprise 
bonds first and, later, shares when the enterprise adopts the 
shareholding system. 
  c) There are some enterprises which cannot be converted into 
shareholding enterprises. In this case, the loan in question may 
be converted into low-interest long-term enterprise bonds that 
may be paid off in stages. Each year the enterprise is required 
to set aside a portion of its retained profit to pay off a part 
of the loan. Other methods may also be used to raise funds to 
repay the loan. 
  d) In case the debtor is no longer around or nobody can be 
found who can be held responsible for repaying the loan, it 
should be reported in its full value and written off outright. 
That way enterprises would be free to enter the market 
unburdened. Large state banks too can be converted into 
commercial banks sooner.

<F P=106> [Article by Lu Licheng (7120 4539 2052): "Effects of New Tax </F>
System"] 
  [Text] On 1 January this year, China formally put into 
effect a new tax system. What are the new tax system's effects 
on local financial income and local economic development? This 
question has become a "hot point" of concern in all quarters of 
society. Now, with Baoying City, Jiangsu Province, as an 
example, I will make a brief analysis of this question. 
<H5>  Effects of New Tax System on Local Financial Income </H5>
  Under the old tax system, the proportionate division of this 
county's income from industrial and commercial tax revenue was: 
above-line 35 percent; retained 65 percent. After the new tax 
system was put into effect, this county's local financial income 
was mainly composed of two large parts: one part was that of the 
25 percent consisting of fixed income and value added tax; the 
other part was that of the total amount of the consumption tax 
and 75 percent of the value added tax, 45 percent of which was 
retained. Accordingly, the data for the first two months of this 
year are calculated as follows: 
  1. Separate above-line figure = (227,000 yuan in consumption 
tax + 8.46 million yuan in value added tax x 75%) x 
55% = 
3.615 million yuan. 
  2. County-level above-line figure = 3.615 million yuan in 
separate above-plan figure + 2.281 million in province-level 
income + central-level income (other) = 5.896 million yuan. 
  3. Separate retained-for-use figure = (227,000 yuan in 
consumption tax + 8.46 million yuan in value added tax) x 
45% + 
8.46 million yuan in consumption tax x 25% = 5.072 
million yuan. 
  4. County-level retained-for-use figure = 5.072 million yuan 
in separate retained-for-use figure + 2.261 million yuan in 
local fixed income = 7.333 million yuan. 
  5. Separate proportions: 
  a) Above-plan proportion = 3.615 million yuan in separate 
above-plan figure 10.948 million yuan in local income x 
100% = 33.02%. 
  b) Retained-for-use proportion = 66.98%. 
  From a look at the resultant calculations, we see that, 
after 
the new tax system was put into effect, the above-plan 
proportion fell by about 2 percentage points. In line with the 
actual results in 1993 and calculating the proportional income, 
in 1994 the tax revenue income will be about 96.52 million yuan, 
and subtracting the provincial-level income of 3.2 million yuan, 
the central- and country-level income will be 93.32 million 
yuan. According to calculations under the new tax system, the 
country-level retained-for-use figure will be about 62.52 
million yuan; under the old tax system, which calculated 
separate financial proportions, the county-level 
retained-for-use figure would have been about 60.56 million 
yuan. Thus, under the new tax system, this county's 
retained-for-use financial strength is slightly greater than the 
retained-for-use financial strength under the old tax system. 
<H5>  Effects of New Tax System on Local Economy </H5>
  1. Positive effects: 
  The new tax system makes uniform the income tax for domestic 
venture enterprises and the circulation tax for domestic and 
foreign venture enterprises; it also, in the "Provisional 
Regulations for Value Added Tax," stipulates that there are only 
three grades of rates--zero tax rate, 13 percent low tax rate, 
and 17 percent regular tax rate--in order to provide a tax 
revenue environment conducive to competition on an equal basis. 
The tax burden under the former tax system on some high tax-rate 
products has been reduced by a fairly large amount, e.g., on 
rubber products, paint, miscellaneous goods, and other chemical 
industry products, and on electric wire, electric cable, woolen 
products, glass products, and electric power products. For 
example, in this county the electric cable factory's value added 
tax, under the old system, was a levy of 21 percent and a 
discount of 14 percent, but the actual tax burden was about 10 
percent of the tax-included value; under the new tax system, the 
levy is 17 percent and the discount is 17 percent, and so the 
actual tax burden is 5.5 percent of the tax-included value. 
Under the old tax system, the product tax rate paid by the 
county's miscellaneous goods factory was 16 percent of the 
tax-included value; the new tax system changed to a value added 
tax rate with a levy of 17 percent and a discount of 17 percent, 
making the actual tax burden approximately equal to 5 percent of 
the tax-included value. The product tax rate for the county's 
electric power bureau under the old tax system was 10 percent; 
under the new tax system, there was a change to a value added 
tax with a rate equal to only about 3 percent of the 
tax-included value. 
  The tax burden on commercial retail enterprises has also 
been 
lightened. The new tax system changes the business tax of 5 
percent of retail value to a value added tax with a levy of 17 
percent and a discount of 17 percent in line with the 
non-tax-included value, and after making calculations we find 
that the actual tax burden is only equal to about 3 percent of 
the tax-included value. 
  2. Equal effects: 
  With regard to foreign-funded enterprises that were set up 
before 1993, and the increased tax burden after the new tax 
system was put into effect, the method of "first levying taxes 
and afterward withdrawing" was adopted in order not to increase 
the tax burden on foreign-funded, to obtain credit from foreign 
businessmen, and to maintain the continuity of the policy of 
opening up to the outside world. 
  After the new tax system was put in effect, there was a 
fairly big increase in the tax burden on some enterprises: e.g., 
cement, brick, and waste product purchasing and processing 
enterprises; grain enterprises; nonstaple food enterprises; and 
chemical fertilizer, agricultural chemical, and agricultural 
capital goods enterprises. The State Council and all levels are 
studying the formulation of specific policies and measures, and, 
following the thorough implementation of these policies and 
measures, the problems facing these enterprises can basically be 
solved. 
  3. Negative effects: 
  Newly run township and town enterprises, and enterprises 
like 
cooperative stores and restaurants, which formerly enjoyed tax 
reduction or exemption, will, without exception, have their tax 
reduction or exemption eliminated after the new tax system is 
implemented. If these enterprises do not develop new products, 
adjust their product mix, enhance their management, stress 
returns, and seek development, they will certainly be hard hit. 
  For production enterprises that use agricultural and 
sideline 
products as their raw materials, e.g., those in the cotton 
spinning, silk reeling, and papermaking industries, the new tax 
system stipulates that their income tax be calculated at 10 
percent, and for enterprises in other industries, by comparison, 
the income tax be calculated at 17 percent, a tax burden that is 
clearly on the high side. 
  For commercial wholesale enterprises, under the former tax 
system, there was a 10 percent tax on the import sales price 
differential, but under the new tax system the tax is 17 percent 
of the non-tax-included value with a 17 percent discount; the 
actual tax burden is equal to about 13.8 percent of the tax 
calculated under the former tax system, so the tax burden is 
increased 3.8 percentage points. 
  Compared to the tax burden on the ordinary taxpayer, the tax 
burden on the small-scale taxpayer is a little heavy, and the 
use of the "value-added tax special-use voucher" is not allowed. 
Thus the production and businesess activities of these 
enterprises is bound to be adversely affected.

Machine-Building Industry: "Issues on China's Machine-Building 
Industry Development in 1994"] 
  [Text] The total output value of China's machine-building 
industry was 269 billion yuan in 1993 including 20.5 billion 
yuan worth of products produced under mandatory plans and 15.9 
billion yuan worth of products produced under guidance plans. 
The output values of the two accounted for 13.1 percent of the 
total output value. It means that 86.9 percent of the products 
have been produced by enterprises in accordance with the market 
situation. The machine-building industry will continue to 
develop itself towards this direction in 1994. 
  China will register another high rate of growth in its 
national economy in 1994. The GNP is expected to rise by 9 
percent. There will be more investments in fixed assets under 
the state plan; and more loopholes will be plugged so that more 
funds will be available for major construction projects as 
compared with 1993. With the improvement of the people's living 
standards, more machinery will be needed in general. The world 
machinery market is also quite vast. Therefore, we reasonably 
believe that there will be a higher rate of growth in the 
machine-building industry in 1994. Naturally demands vary for 
different types of machinery. We must pay attention to the major 
developments in our national economy and the international 
market, and continuously readjust our product mix in order to 
make our products more competitive and export-oriented. As long 
as we go with the tide of the situation, we will be able to 
triumph. 
  Whether or not our machine-building industry will score 
even greater achievements in 1994 lies in how we deepen our 
reform and carry out our production and business activities in 
accordance with the market economic system. 
<H5>  1. Work Hard To Strengthen Market Investigation and Survey, </H5>
and Business Policy-Making. 
  Enterprises must pay full attention to the markets. They 
must fully understand the actual requirements of the 
international market as well as the domestic market. They must 
also study the potential requirements, and gather all kinds of 
information. They must fully understand consumer needs, market 
capacity and the current situation in promoting scientific 
research and development. They must know their competitors' 
product features, means of production, production costs, prices 
as well as their supporting factories' properties of products, 
production capacity, delivery schedule. The enterprise must also 
take advantage of their own advantages. They should know their 
competitors and themselves. Only then, will it be possible for 
them to win victories. Although work in this respect has been 
strengthened since machine-building industry has changed its 
trend from one of product economy to one of commodity economy, 
it is far not enough. We must mobilize workers in all sectors, 
and carry out the work of investigation and analysis from all 
angles. Enterprises must periodically hold meetings for business 
policy-making; solicit all kinds of proposals; carefully analyze 
them and form policy decisions; and send them back to various 
departments to have them implemented. If the enterprises keep on 
making policy decisions in such a way, they will definitely be 
able to play up their strengths and avoid weaknesses, become 
more competitive and certainly win victories. 
<H5>  2. Work Harder to Strengthen Scientific Research Work </H5>
  The machine-building industry not only supplies facilities 
for the development of the four modernization programs, but also 
provides machinery to help people improve their living 
standards. With the rapid development of science and technology, 
we must fully realize that machinery reflects modern science and 
technology. It is for this reason that we must work hard to 
strengthen scientific research work. Whoever produces fine and 
durable machinery will win consumers' confidence. Modern science 
and technology demand that we train a group of professionals of 
multiple disciplines. The Art of War by Sun Zi 
mentioned: "There are only five colors, but it is hard to 
perceive the changes of the five colors. There are only five 
flavors, but it is hard to fathom the changes of the five 
flavors." It means that there are only the red, yellow, blue, 
white and black colors, but it is hard to estimate the number of 
changes in mixing all the colors. There are only five flavors -- 
sweet, sour, bitter, pungent and salty --, but it is difficult 
to fathom the changes when all flavors are mixed in cooking. We 
might as well regard the modern machinery as a combination of 
devices using technologies in machine-building, electricity, 
hydraulics, gas and light. The changes are unlimited. As long as 
we combine them in different way and in a flexible manner, our 
opportunities know no bounds as pointed out by the Art of 
War by Sun Zi. 
  We must mainly rely on ourselves to improve our products. 
Enterprises must strengthen their forces in conducting 
scientific research and development. Meanwhile, they must also 
solicit outside help by importing foreign technologies and 
cooperating with scientific research organizations and colleges 
and institutions of higher learning. 
<H5>  3. Work Harder to Readjust Enterprises' Product Mix </H5>
  Only when products are readily marketable, can enterprises 
that manufacture such products flourish. Enterprises must follow 
the market when they turn out their products. However, the 
supply and demand on a market are constantly changing. Actually 
all machinery products will go through the stage of development, 
stage of growth, stage of maturity and stage of obsolescence. 
The current situation is that such cyclic changes are becoming 
faster and faster. Therefore, enterprises must constantly adjust 
their product mix. Those enterprises which manufacture a single 
product must start working on the next generation when their 
product of the previous generation has entered the stage of 
maturity and the sale of such product is still good so that the 
new product will be able to replace the old when the time comes. 
Enterprises that manufacture many varieties of products must 
upgrade their products on a rotation basis. Thus, their 
production and management should be developed in a balanced 
manner. Efforts must be made to prevent any adjustment of the 
product mix from adversely affecting the operation of the 
enterprises. 
  The adjustment of the product mix may also create a series 
of 
problems to production engineering. Right now, foreign 
machine-building factories often make full use of numerical 
control machine tools and institute the soft manufacturing 
system. This is aimed at increasing the capability of the 
enterprises in coping with changes. Although the initial 
investment will be greater, it can shorten the period and reduce 
the cost in adjusting the product mix. Basically speaking, it is 
worthwhile to do so. 
(h3} 4. Work harder to Push Sales 
  If it is said that to strengthen market surveys, make 
correct 
policy decisions and develop products that are readily 
marketable is a process of cognition and practice from the 
market to the product, then how to make consumers know the 
product and help such product become more marketable is also an 
important process which is definitely not less important than 
the first one. We often talk about helping the product "work its 
way" into the market. This phrase "work its way" means that we 
must strengthen our efforts in pushing the sales of the product. 
A good salesperson must carefully brief the customer about the 
performance, quality, delivery schedule, price, after-service 
and other good points of his own product, and make the customer 
feel at ease and pleased to buy such product. A salesperson with 
good business ethics must never try to defame other people's 
products. He should know how to give prominence to his own 
products. 
  As far as each enterprise is concerned, to push the sales of 
products is not merely selling the merchandise alone. The 
enterprise must introduce to the customer the capability of the 
factory in developing and manufacturing the products. It should 
supply the appropriate machinery equipment in accordance with 
the customer's requirements. 
  In order to adapt ourselves to market mechanism and sell 
more 
machinery products, we must pay attention to public bidding and 
carry out our work well in submitting tenders. To succeed in 
public bidding, we must, first of all, satisfy the needs of the 
consumer, be more competitive among the fellow bidders, and make 
money for one's own enterprise. In order to make correct and 
timely responses, the enterprises must compile all kinds of 
reference material and build various types of data bases. 
  Enterprises must strive to build and cherish their own 
reputation. They should realize that only with a good 
reputation, can their products enjoy a greater share of the 
market. 
<H5>  5. Work Harder to Strengthen Enterprise Management In Order </H5>
to Become More Competitive 
  It is necessary to become more competitive in terms of 
performance, quality, delivery date, price and services. All of 
them are based upon an enterprise's scientific management in 
quality and cost control and its energy and material-saving 
measures and its production technology. All these are important 
aspects. The Ministry of Machine-Building Industry must 
regularly call for efforts to strengthen enterprise management 
and raise their standards. All this is aimed at making 
themselves more competitive. What merits attention is the fact 
that some time ago when the sales of machinery products were 
picking up, some enterprises once again attached importance to 
speed and price only instead of management efficiency. It is 
necessary to rectify this situation. 
<H5>  6. Work Harder to Strengthen Motivational Mechanism </H5>
  Heaven makes the final decision as to how things shall end 
up. How to fully arouse man's enthusiasm is an extremely 
important issue. The leadership of the various enterprises must 
adopt measures to help workers strengthen unity and become more 
creative and encourage them to make suggestions and work harder 
than ever before for the enterprises. Efforts must be made to 
improve personnel management, the wage system and the incentive 
mechanism, and to encourage the professionally qualified people 
to work harder and offer more to the enterprises

<F P=106> [Article by Qie (STC not available) Jianwei (1696 0251) of </F>
the National Economy Office, State Planning Commission: 
"Socialist Market Economy Seen As Boost to Population Planning"] 
  [Excerpts] 
  1. Population planning as a method of managing human 
reproduction. [passages omitted] 
  In setting population control goals, drawing up a population 
plan, transmitting it to lower levels for implementation, and 
supervising and inspecting its implementation, we must take into 
full consideration China's level of economic development and 
public thinking on reproduction, which is what all of this must 
be based on. Remove this base and go beyond the threshold 
defined by our level of economic development, and we would 
achieve nothing. Drawing up a population plan divorced from 
reality, setting overly ambitious population growth targets, and 
trying to reach those targets through command planning are bound 
to be counterproductive in the end. There may be some 
short-term success, but it is certain that it will neither last 
nor be consolidated. On the contrary, we may well end up with a 
compensatory population growth after a certain period of time. 
  The principal inconsistency in population control in China 
today is essentially one between population control and the 
level of economic development, between relatively advanced 
population control methods and a more backward level of economic 
development. Fundamentally speaking, the difficulty China has 
to date in adjusting human reproduction stems from the 
backwardness of economic development and the low level of 
productive forces, from the fact that we are trying to establish 
a relatively advanced pattern of fertility on the basis of a 
backward economy. What is in existence now, it must be said, is 
only the rudiments of the condition needed for adjusting the 
pattern of human reproduction and population control. Thus, our 
population planning, adjustment and control must similarly be 
preliminary. Population planning can only be broad and flexible 
guidance planning. It is unrealistic to think that we can now 
achieve overly ambitious population control objectives through 
mandatory population planning. 
  Birth control work in China was born under the planning 
system and inevitably therefore exhibits many of the latter's 
characteristics. In its formulation, transmission to lower 
level, implementation, and inspection, as well as in its format, 
targets, and content, population planning in fact has borrowed 
extensively from material reproduction planning. In particular, 
like command planning, population planning sets mandatory 
targets that must not be exceeded. Objectively speaking, for a 
variety of reasons we were nowhere near managing the process of 
material reproduction completely in accordance with a command 
plan even during the era of economic planning. Moreover, 
history has demonstrated that orchestrating material economic 
construction beyond the level of economic development in any 
specific stage through command planning militates against 
mobilizing the initiative of all quarters, fostering the 
development of multiple economies, raising the level of 
productive forces, and improving the people's living standards. 
If anything, the process of human reproduction is far more 
complex than market reproduction. It is influenced by a host of 
factors, including politics, society, history, even religion, 
geography, climate, and local customs and habits, in addition to 
economic development. Furthermore, the scope of application of 
population planning is wider than that of material reproduction 
planning. Material planning typically involves only the 
sectors, industries, and enterprises concerned. In the case of 
population planning broadly defined, in contrast, people's 
governments at all levels, enterprises and institutions, as well 
as all basic units are responsible for organizing and carrying 
out population planning. And a substantial number of citizens 
nationwide are the subjects of such planning; no other form of 
economic and social development planning has this 
characteristic. Just consider: Given this country's relatively 
low level of economic development, its long history of 
feudalism, its vast size, and the diversity of regional 
conditions, how can it possibly manage the very complex process 
of human reproduction through command planning? Planning is 
ideological. It is a subjective reflection of the objective and 
is based on our projection of how objective things will develop 
in the future. If we try to carry out a command population plan 
coercively in isolation from the reality in China, the 
inevitable result will be a divorce between the subjective and 
the objective in our guiding thought. Planning and reality will 
then be completely out of step with each other and the real 
effectiveness of population control will suffer. 
  2. To cite economic planning as the basic reason for the 
adoption of birth control programs in China has no basis in 
fact. On the other hand, it is also not objective to deny the 
intimate interdependency between China's population control 
program and its highly centralized form of economic planning. 
This is precisely why the formulation, transmission, and 
implementation of the population control plan, as well as its 
methods, which was evolved under the system of economic 
planning, will take a beating now since we have made the 
establishment of a socialist market economy the objective of 
economic structural reform. 
  2.1 Economic planning emphasizes administrative management 
of 
a highly centralized nature whereas the market economy stresses 
the use of the law of value to bring about the optimal 
allocation of resources. As reform deepens, administrative 
tools will play a diminishing role in economic management, some 
of them replaced by economic and legal tools. Administrative 
measures are the principal tools for implementing the population 
plan in China. For instance, individuals who violate the birth 
control policy would be subject to disciplinary sanctions and 
leading cadres are the target of "one-vote veto" for failing to 
accomplish the population control plan. In a market economy, 
enterprises operate as independent commodity producers and 
traders which exercise decision-making authority in their 
operations and take risk on their own. It is the enterprises' 
own bottom line that will determine their behavior. Out of 
economic self-interests, enterprise leaders are absolutely free 
to cut back on the use of or stop using administrative tools in 
dealing with violators of the family planning policy and other 
matters not directly related to production. They may even relax 
birth control management or scrap such management altogether. 
After the hiring system is changed, the powers and obligations 
of an employer vis-a-vis his employees and vice versa will be 
laid down explicitly in a contract. It is not likely that 
administrative sanctions can override this legal document and 
become valid, particularly in birth control cases. 
  2.2 With a market economy, China will no longer feature just 
one form of public ownership, namely public ownership. Instead, 
there will be multiple ownership systems dominated by public 
ownership. This will lead to the formation of a host of 
distribution mechanisms led by distribution according to work, 
with others playing a supplementary role. Price reform will 
spell an end to the assorted defects caused by distorted price 
signals and powerfully regulate the formation of personal 
disposable income. The demise of egalitarianism and the 
implementation of the policy of allowing some people to get rich 
ahead of others will inevitably widen income gaps. All these 
changes will deal a heavy blow to economic penalties as an 
instrument of birth control management. The policy of fining 
somebody for violating the population control plan does not work 
when the violator is high-income. He will simply pay up and 
have his child anyway. The rise in the incomes of rural and 
urban households will render insignificant the material 
incentives for having a one-child family. The government may 
make the incentives more generous but how is it going to pay for 
them? As for making compliance with the birth control policy a 
criterion in reviewing and approving certain types of economic 
activities, that too runs counter to certain tenets of the 
market economy. 
  2.3 In a market economy China's labor market will mature 
even 
more rapidly. The market restraining mechanism for achieving the 
optimal allocation of labor resources through the circulation of 
manpower will become stronger and stronger. Driven by economic 
interests, workers will migrate between urban and rural areas, 
among sectors, from one ownership system to another, and between 
enterprises, breaking down all barriers that have shackled them. 
Labor mobility in turn will spawn the movement of population. 
The fact of the matter is that already some of the underlying 
conditions that have hampered population movement have been 
reformed in recent years or are about to undergo some change. 
So far 28 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities 
directly administered by the central government have revamped 
their grain procurement and marketing system and many cities 
have abolished grain rationing. In fact grain has been 
circulating on the market like any other ordinary commodity. 
The rules for transforming the enterprise mechanism are clear. 
Enterprises are free to decide on their own how long they want 
to keep an employee and the size of their staff. There are some 
restrictions on the use of peasant workers; realistically 
speaking, however, it would be difficult to prevent an 
enterprise from choosing workers of a particular origin based on 
need. Housing reform will provide an even easier solution to 
the problem of housing people and workers on the move. Also in 
the works is the reform of the permanent residency registration 
system. As I see it, all these reforms mentioned above are a 
boost to economic development and would help check population 
growth in the long run. However, we must see that the current 
system of population growth management to a large extent is 
dependent on the system described above. The way a birth control 
policy violator is handled, for instance, is tied in with the 
various rules and regulations governing residency registration, 
housing, grain rationing, and employment. The implementation of 
the assorted reforms mentioned above and the consequent massive 
increase in the floating population will also deal a heavy blow 
to the territoriality principle of the present system of 
population growth management. 
  In remunerating the ways in which the deepening of economic 
structural reform and the continuous improvement of the market 
mechanism will batter the mechanism and modes of operation of 
the present system of population growth management, we are not 
trying to link economic planning to family planning and 
population control or suggesting that the latter is based on the 
former. Instead what we are saying is that we must pragmatically 
understand the dependency of the operating mechanism of 
population planning on economic planning, appreciate the way in 
which our current work would be affected by our choice of a 
socialist market economy as the goal of economic reform, and 
realize the need to come up with a new population control 
mechanism and methods of management based on the principles of 
the market economy. The aim is to change the reproductive 
aspirations of society and alter its reproductive behavior, thus 
further achieving the basic national policy of family planning 
in the new era. 
  We should not feel pessimistic because family planning work 
has come under heavy pressure. If we analyze the whole picture 
and think long term, in fact, the establishment of a socialist 
market economy would help change the public's thinking on 
reproduction in a fundamental way, which would improve the 
overall climate for family planning work and create a population 
growth control mechanism where the macroeconomy meets the 
micoreconomy, thereby giving an impetus to family planning work 
in China. This is how it will work: 
  a) What has happened since reform got under way proves 
conclusively that a highly centralized planned economy is not 
compatible with the level of productive forces in China. The 
fact that there is just one ownership system is not conducive to 
mobilizing the initiative of all quarters and retards economic 
development. In putting forward unequivocally the establishment 
of a socialist market economy as the objective of economic 
structural reform, our basic purpose is to further liberate and 
develop productive forces, make China more powerful all around 
and raise the people's living standards. Using a wealth of 
facts from both China and the rest of the world, both past and 
present, many demographers have proved a causal relationship 
between economic development and fertility rates and identified 
the ways in which economic conditions influence reproductive 
aspirations. In China, it is economic backwardness that lies at 
the root of a fairly high birthrate. For this reason achieving 
fast economic growth and improving the people's living standards 
are a basic precondition for checking population growth. The 
relatively low natural population growth rates in the West are 
primarily the result of its high level of economic development. 
Here in China, we can also explain the fact that the overall 
urban birth rate is much lower than its rural counterpart by 
pointing to the higher living standard in cities, their 
relatively comprehensive social security system, and their more 
complete range of services. We have every reason to believe 
that as the market economy becomes more and more comprehensive 
and people's living standards keep going up, the basic 
conditions for birth control work will improve substantially and 
the reproductive aspirations of the people will change 
fundamentally. 
  b. The perfection of the market economy will further blur 
the 
boundaries between the city and the countryside and spur the 
movement of rural workers and the rural population, thus 
dramatically accelerating urbanization in China. In the days of 
highly centralized economic planning, we used administrative 
methods to sever the links between the city and the countryside 
artificially and prevented the movement of the rural population 
in a variety of ways, using all our ingenuity to bind peasants 
to the soil. As a result, not only did Chinese urbanization 
suffer badly stunted growth and peasants' living standards 
lagged, but the vast number of peasants remained shackled 
ideologically with the philosophy of the small peasant economy 
and wedded to backward production methods, thereby hindering 
their acceptance of new concepts, new thinking, and new things. 
This ideological base has also reduced their acceptance of 
family planning propaganda and affected the implementation of 
the population plan. The development of the market economy will 
bring to fruition the realignment of elements of production. 
Grain, price, and housing reforms will gradually break down the 
assorted barriers to peasants entering a city to work, do 
business, or start an enterprise. The massive migration of 
peasants and the birth and growth of small and mid-sized cities 
in large numbers have become irreversible trends. When large 
numbers of peasants leave the land permanently or periodically, 
ending the small-peasant-economy way of life, and enter the 
cities to join forces with new capital goods and new production 
methods, they will become that much more amenable to new ideas, 
including ideas on reproduction. This will give a boost to the 
launching of rural birth control work. 
  c. The reform of the employment system is an important 
component of the development of a market economy. In the past, 
the government took care of distribution in urban areas and gave 
workers jobs for life, at the same time making sure that 
peasants in the countryside were kept out of the cities. Now 
that arrangement will be dealt a heavy blow by the market 
economy. In accordance with the rules for transforming the 
enterprise operating mechanism, the enterprise hiring system of 
the future will be one of dual choice. The enterprise will 
decide the duration of employment, how many people it will hire, 
and the form of such employment. The employee, for his part, 
will also get to choose which enterprise he wants to join and in 
what capacity. Nowadays, enterprises particularly state 
enterprises, are over-staffed with a large number of redundant 
personnel. With hiring reform, this situation will become a 
thing of the past. Meanwhile, the state will phase out the 
practice of providing jobs to college and technical secondary 
school graduates. When we consider also the large numbers of 
peasants making their way into urban areas, we could see that 
the problem of labor oversupply in China will become apparent. 
For a while the employment market will come under enormous 
pressure. With a new mechanism, employment pressures will no 
longer be artificially masked. Not only will the government be 
aware of such pressures but, thanks to the media, so will every 
household and every individual. The awareness of employment 
pressures will influence the thinking of every individual, 
forcing him to modify his behavior, including reproductive 
behavior. 
  d. The introduction of the market mechanism into the hiring 
system and employment system will hasten the maturation of the 
labor market and intensify the competition for jobs among 
workers. More and more, whether or not a worker lands a job, 
his working conditions, and the size of his paycheck will depend 
on his quality. The result is a deeper understanding by the 
public of the importance of a population's quality. There comes 
a point in economic development when the main driving force 
behind rising household incomes is no longer an increase in the 
quantity of labor inputs but an improvement in their quality. 
When that comes to pass, every family will naturally take 
special pains to improve the physical and cultural quality of 
its children by investing significantly more in their education. 
Thus willingly or unwillingly people must practice birth 
control. Moreover, young men and women in their prime 
reproductive years find themselves in a fiercely competitive job 
market. Their mission--raising their educational standard, 
acquiring work skills, and making themselves more 
competitive--will also force them to have fewer children. 
  e. Both the reform and improvement of the urban social 
security system and the creation of a rural social security 
system are the objective requirements of perfecting the 
socialist market economy. In urban reform we should focus on 
expanding the scope of social security, diversifying the sources 
of insurance funds, and establishing a personal contribution 
mechanism to put an end to the practice of having the state pay 
for everything. These measures will consolidate the 
achievements of family planning in cities. In the countryside, 
we should concentrate on establishing a variety of social 
security systems to suit the characteristics of a locality. For 
starters, we need to provide for the elderly. In most rural 
areas in China today the elderly remain dependent on their 
children to provide for them, an arrangement that will come 
under challenge from the development of the market economy, the 
shift of rural manpower into non-agricultural sectors, the 
breakdown of urban-rural barriers, and the migration of urban 
and rural workers. It is objectively imperative that this 
practice be reformed and social security be introduced. Thus 
establishing a social security system in the countryside is 
absolutely not just a matter of providing welfare for the 
elderly, but has to do with the market economy. The creation of 
a rural social security system will powerfully stimulate changes 
in public thinking on reproduction. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In leading the great mission of our nation's 
socialist modernization, reform and opening up, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping has consistently stressed tasks related to the working 
class and the labor unions. The various major statements he has 
made concerning total reliance on the working class, giving full 
play to the role of the labor unions and similar topics are a 
scientific summation of the workers' movement and the work of 
the labor unions in our country, are the most formidable 
ideological weapon for the promotion of the healthy development 
of the labor movement and labor union work in our nation, and 
have become a major and integral part of the theory of 
establishing socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  The earnest study and penetrating research into Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's thoughts on the working class and the labor unions is 
of extremely vital and immediate significance and profound 
historical significance as regards gaining a deep understanding 
of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, as regards the fundamental guiding principles 
of comprehensively carrying out the Party's basic line and 
wholeheartedly relying on the working class, as regards actively 
seeking out the new paths for the work of the labor unions which 
are imbued with Chinese socialism, and diligently creating new 
situations in labor union work, to come together and mobilize 
the billion workers to more closely unite around the party 
center with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, to fight the hard 
fight, and win the great victory of the cause of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  The book Deng Xiaoping on The Working Class and Labor 
Unions, edited and published by the All-China Federation of 
Trade Unions (ACFTU), is one of the major foundations of trade 
union theory, and with major support and help from Central 
Document Research Office, the Central Archives and the news 
media, Deng Xiaoping on The Working Class and Labor 
Unions, is presented today to the reading public. This 
book is a selection of expositions made in various historical 
periods by Comrade Deng Xiaoping on the subject of the working 
class and trade unions, a total of 55 major pieces. Using the 
"Speech Delivered at the Ninth National Convention of the ACFTU" 
as the introduction to the entire work, the remainder is 
arranged according to historical periods, and incorporates 32 
works written since the 3rd Plenum of the 11th Central 
Committee, 19 works from the period between the founding of the 
nation and the 3rd Plenum, and three works from the period 
before liberation. 
  Of the 55 works included, 40 were taken from the first three 
volumes of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, three 
from Deng Xiaoping on Building the Party; four items 
appeared in the PEOPLES DAILY and the CHINA WOMENS DAILY 
newspapers; six of the works were published by the ACFTU; two 
works, "Outline of the Report Given at the Southwest Sector 
Cities Work Meeting" and "On the Correct Relationship of the 
Party with Mass Organizations" are here published for the first 
time. 
  The introductory speech was given by comrade Deng Xiaoping 
as 
representative of the Party Center and the State Council at the 
Ninth Plenum of the ACFTU on 11 October 1978 when, with the bold 
vision of a proletarian strategist he revealed the great 
continent of China was about to enter the historical era of 
reform and opening up, and incisively pointed out that reform 
was "a great revolution" and clearly set forth the historical 
mission of the working class and the workers' movement, 
penetratingly explained that the work of the trade unions in the 
new era must be to educate and mobilize the workers to make 
contributions to the "four modernizations," that the trade 
unions must speak for and accomplish things for the workers, 
must struggle for the democratic rights of the workers, and lay 
an important theoretical foundation for opening up a new path 
for our nation's workers movement and for the work of the trade 
unions, which became the program of action for the workers 
movement and the trade union's work in the new period. 
  Clearly one of the main themes running through Deng 
Xiaoping on The Working Class and Labor Unions is the 
ideology of completely relying upon the working class. The 
speech "Outline of the Report Given at the Southwest Sector 
Cities Work Meeting" published here for the first time, is the 
outline of a report personally scribed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
in 1950 for the first cities work conference convened in the 
southwest sector. In this report outline, Comrade Xiaoping 
thoroughly explains how to rely on the working class. He says: 
first, from an ideological viewpoint one must realize the role 
of the working class, that if one does not rely on the working 
class, industrial production will be impossible and no 
advancement to socialism can be made. Secondly, we must organize 
the majority of the workers into the trade unions. If we neglect 
trade union work, our reliance on the working class will be 
without substance. Thirdly, be zealous in our concern for every 
aspect of the working class; take care of all their political, 
cultural, living and material benefits' requirements; do not 
lightly dismiss the "small matters" which are of benefit to the 
workers. 
  Be on guard against the erroneous viewpoint of those 
comrades 
who rely upon them in times of difficulty but not when things 
are going well, who rely when they need them, and do not rely on 
them when they do not need them, who talk about relying on them 
but do not really think they must rely on them at all. Such 
errors must be corrected. Fourthly, relying on the working class 
must become the guiding ideology of the Party; it must pervade 
each and every department; it cannot be considered the 
responsibility of only the trade unions and the factories. These 
vitally important thoughts expressed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
still have very real and practical applications, major 
theoretical implications and continuing historical significance 
under the new situation of reform and opening up. 
  Wholeheartedly relying upon the working class has been 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's consistent thinking. As early as 1956 
in his report given on the revision of the Party Constitution at 
the Eighth Party Congress he elucidated the party's mass line. 
Speaking from the level of historical materialism, he pointed 
out: "Marxism has always held that, in the final analysis, 
history is created by the popular masses. The working class must 
rely upon the mass power of its own class and the mass power of 
the entire body of working people: only then can it fulfill its 
own historical mission." Since the 3rd Plenum of the 11th 
Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has frequently spoke 
about the historical position and role of the working class, 
reiterating that "Through a long series of trials the working 
class of our nation has proved itself to be a revolutionary 
leading class steadfast in its stand." He has clearly pointed 
out that: "the working class is reliable." 
  Deng Xiaoping on The Working Class and Labor 
Unions repeatedly emphasizes the relationship between 
strengthening the party's leadership and the labor unions 
carrying out their work in an independent and self sustaining 
manner. On the one hand he emphasizes that the mass organs 
should lay out their work in accordance with the overall work of 
the party, respect the party's leadership, and absolutely never 
support a work goal which is in opposition to party goals. On 
the other hand, he also emphasizes that the party committees 
should honor the independent nature of the mass organs, and 
should not run the union's show as they please without 
consulting them. We must not only avoid the tendency of the mass 
organs breaking away from the party's political leadership, but 
must also avoid the tendency of the party running everything. 
The present volume for the first time publishes the summation 
he gave at a meeting of high level cadre of the Taxing sub 
bureau on 20 February 1942 wherein he clearly stated that one of 
the major criteria for trade union work is "the question of the 
correct relations between the party and the mass organization." 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always paid close attention to the 
problem of democratic control of enterprises. In his "Outline of 
the Report Given at the Southwest Sector Cities Work Meeting" 
given in 1950, he specifically brings up the question about 
enterprises carrying out the "democratization of management" He 
is of the opinion that the democratization of management must 
take place within "reliance upon a union of workers and staff" 
especially it should come about in a form embodying the trade 
union, the workers management committee and the staff 
representative committee. If it is not done this way there can 
be no talk of democratization, since there would be no 
democratic content to it. In 1957 at the 3rd Plenum of the 
Eighth Party Congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that 
"the congress of staff and worker representatives expands the 
democratic nature of the enterprise, is an ideal form which 
brings in the staff and the workers to join in management of the 
enterprise, staves off bureaucracy, and is one of the effective 
methods of handling contradictions among the people." In 1978 in 
his speech at the ACFTU's Ninth Congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
reiterated: "All enterprises, without exception, must implement 
democratic management," "each enterprise's trade union should 
become a working organ composed of the staff and workers 
representative committee and the staff and workers congress." 
Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Committee, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping has taken as the order of the day the democratization 
of enterprise management as being one of the major components of 
reform of the enterprise management system. He has repeatedly 
emphasized one of the three major components of the reform of 
the political system is to "stimulate the enthusiasm of the 
lower levels, the workers, peasants and intellectuals to 
participate in management, so that the democratization of 
management can be realized." 
  The nature of the socialist country and the basic socialist 
system determine that, no matter what changes take place in the 
enterprise system, we must always carry through with the thought 
of Deng Xiaoping, support and perfect the system of staff-worker 
congresses, and give full play to the role of the trade unions 
and democratic management rights of the staff and workers. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on the working class and the 
trade unions is large on content, incisive in exposition. 
Beginning with the inherent characteristics and historical 
mission, he reiterates the idea that the working class is the 
leading class of the revolution and calls upon the working class 
to display its glorious tradition of struggle and hard work and 
make its contribution to the realization of the four 
modernizations. He calls upon the working class to strive to 
grasp modern technological knowledge and management techniques, 
to act as vanguard role models in the reforms, emphasizing that 
the model workers and exemplary revolutionaries who appear among 
the masses of staff and workers are the models we study and the 
core about which we unite. He also puts forward the views that 
the intellectuals are one of the parts of the working class; and 
the working class in our country should strengthen its ties with 
workers across the world, and so forth. On the basis of a 
summary of the historical experiences of our nation's trade 
union work, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly points out that the 
trade unions are not something that we can do as well with as 
without, it should be an organization the workers can believe 
in, that speaks for the workers and does things for the workers, 
so that the broad masses of workers all feel that the trade 
union is indeed the workers' own organization. 
  He believes that implementation of the four modernizations 
is 
the basic task of the trade unions in the new era and the 
quality of the work of the trade unions will influence the 
workers in the performance of their rights as masters of their 
house. He emphasized that the trade union organizations must 
keep closely linked to the masses, and must themselves be models 
of democracy. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speeches on the work of 
the trade unions clearly point out the path we are to follow, 
and are a formidable ideological tool for accomplishing trade 
union work in the new era. 
  Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics strive to find 
new paths for trade union work in the new era, and earnestly 
strive to create a new situation in trade union work.

"Statistical Bureau, Ministry of Labor Publish Report on the 
Development of Labor Affairs During 1993"] 
  [Text] Today, the Statistical Bureau and the Ministry of 
Labor published a joint report on the development of labor 
affairs during 1993. The report indicates that new achievements 
have been accomplished in three aspects of the reform of labor 
affairs, namely in the further promotion of labor, in wages, and 
in social security, with key concern having been given to the 
nurturing and development of manpower markets. 
  In 1993, the nation's entire manpower resource amounted to 
820 million persons, and the number of employed was 605.9 
million, which was 11.58 million more than in the preceding 
year. The total number of persons requiring employment in all 
the urban areas of the nation was 11.47 million. Of these, 7.05 
million were placed throughout the year, leaving 4.2 million 
still unemployed, thus giving an unemployment rate of 2.6 
percent. 
  Reform of the labor system toward one in which labor 
contracts signed by all staff and workers would constitute the 
major component of labor relations was widely extended beyond 
the experiments of the past. By the end of 1993, a total of 5.5 
million staff and workers in state-owned and collective-owned 
enterprises throughout the nation had participated in the reform 
of the labor system, and 3.5 million of these had become staff 
and workers on the labor contract system, making up 31 percent 
of all enterprise staff and workers. 
  Salaries and wages were further raised. In 1993, total 
salaries and wages paid to staff and workers throughout the 
urban areas of the nation amounted to 477 billion yuan, which 
was 21.1 percent more than in the preceding year. Average 
staff-worker pay was 3,236 yuan, a 19.4 percent increase over 
the preceding year, but taking the commodity price inflation 
factor into account, the actual average salary-wage increase was 
2.8 percent. Among these, the average salary-wage of staff and 
workers in state-owned units was 3,441 yuan, an increase of 19.6 
percent. 
  The report reveals that in 1993 China made considerable 
progress in providing social security. During 1993, a total of 
46.1 billion yuan had been paid into the social security fund 
(not including the portion taken care of by the systems 
themselves) and 41.9 billion yuan had been paid out, as 28.8 
billion yuan were carried forward as balance (including 
purchases of special government bonds). In these figures, 44 
billion yuan were paid into the basic old-age insurance fund, 
which paid out 40.8 billion yuan, and 24.5 billion yuan were 
brought forward as balance. 
  By the end of 1993, 618 cities and counties had instituted 
reforms toward an old-age pension scheme, involving 25 million 
staff and workers in state-owned enterprises. 
  The scope to which society as a whole takes charge of 
retirement expenses was further extended. Up to the end of 1993, 
13 provinces, autonomous regions, and centrally controlled 
municipalities had already instituted a system of taking charge 
of retirement expenditure unifiedly at the provincial level. As 
to cities and counties taking charge unifiedly of retirement 
expenditure, apart from the state-owned enterprises which 
throughout the nation had already instituted the system of 
having cities and counties unifiedly taking charge of retirement 
expenditure, there have been 1,927 other cities and counties 
that had begun to have society take charge of retirement 
expenditure for collective-run enterprises in the urban areas, 
an increase of 168, compared with the preceding year. Throughout 
the country, 73.36 million staff and workers and 16.28 retired 
personnel of 590,000 enterprises of various kinds are 
participating in the system of having society unifiedly take 
charge of retirement expenditure. At the same time, a further 
3,100 enterprises have instituted subsidiary old-age insurance, 
involving 500,000 staff and workers; 6,000 enterprises have 
instituted old-age insurance in the nature of savings accounts, 
involving as many as 700,000 persons. Beyond that, as a 
convenience for the vast number of retired personnel, social 
encumbrances of enterprises have been lightened, and throughout 
the country there are already 1,000 cities and counties that 
have instituted systems of having banks or social security 
organs issue pensions. 
  Experiments have been speeded up with reforms toward a 
system 
of insurance against work-related accidents. Throughout the 
country, 500 cities and counties in 19 provinces, autonomous 
regions, and centrally controlled municipalities with a total 
population of 11 million are participating in the reform toward 
insurance against work-related accidents. Central management and 
regulated initiation of a fund for insurance against 
work-related accidents has initially been started, employing a 
system of differential and flexible rates, thereby promoting the 
safety of ongoing production in enterprises. 
  The reform toward a system of medical insurance has been 
further pursued. Throughout the country, 2.6 million staff and 
workers in 221 cities and counties are already participating in 
systems of having society unifiedly take care of medical 
expenditure for employees and workers, and 2.8 million retirees 
in 134 cities and counties are under a system of having their 
medical expenses taken care of unifiedly. 
  The scope and cover of unemployment insurance has been 
further expanded, and the system is being gradually perfected. 
Up to the end of 1993, 532,000 enterprises with a staff and 
workers establishment of 79.24 million are participating in 
unemployment insurance. In 1993, 1.63 billion yuan had been 
raised as unemployment insurance fund, and 930 million yuan have 
been paid out as unemployment relief, medical expenses during 
periods of unemployment, retraining fees, and as expenditure to 
help unemployed take up productive activities. The agencies in 
charge of labor affairs have provided unemployment relief all 
over the country to 1.03 million unemployed, and have thereby 
effectively contributed to social stability. 
  New progress has also been made in the reform toward a 
system 
of maternity insurance. Up to the end of 1993, 268 cities and 
counties -- 170 more than in the preceding year -- had 
instituted maternity insurance for their female employees and 
workers, involving 5.5 million staff and workers. This reform 
adjusts to a certain extent the burden of maternity insurance as 
between the enterprises and promotes employment of women. 
  Nationwide expenditure for insurance and welfare has been 
further increased. In 1993, total nationwide expenditure for 
insurance and welfare amounted to 165.82 billion yuan, an 
increase of 35.79 billion yuan -- or 27.5 percent -- over the 
preceding year. At the end of the year, the number of retirees 
throughout the nation was 27,497,000, and pensions amounted to 
90.17 billion yuan, which was 31.5 percent more than in the 
preceding year. (Figures for retirees and pensions do not 
include any proportion of civil administration departments.) 
  During 1993, the factory safety situation was grim, as there 
was a large increase in the number of accidents and in the 
number of injured and killed personnel during the year, which 
indeed must attract serious attention. Nationwide, work-related 
accidents caused the death of 19,798 enterprise staff and 
workers, an increase of 18.5 percent over the preceding year. Of 
these accidents, 616 had been serious accidents that caused the 
death of three or more persons in the same accident. In these 
accidents 3,819 persons have been killed, and the number of such 
accidents and the number of killed had increased 0.2 and 3.8 
percent, respectively, compared with the preceding year. During 
1993, road and traffic accidents nationwide kept occurring at a 
high rate without diminishing. The number of traffic accidents 
during the year had been 242,343, with 65,508 persons killed and 
142,251 persons injured, and with a direct economic loss of 1 
billion yuan. During 1993, there had been 38,094 conflagrations 
throughout the country, causing the death of 2,467 persons, 
which was 27.4 percent more than in the preceding year. They 
caused economic losses amounted to 1.12 billion yuan (not 
including forest fires), which was an increase of 62.3 percent 
over the preceding year. During 1993, 3,175 accidents of railway 
trains in motion had occurred nationwide, causing 46,781,000 
yuan of direct economic losses, 9.2 percent less than in the 
preceding year. During the year, 2,430 serious accidents had 
occurred on the railway trains themselves, killing 181 persons, 
an increase of 38 percent, and 16,353 serious accidents outside 
the railway tracks, killing 9,989 persons, an increase of 10 
percent over the preceding year. During 1993, 2,008 accidents 
occurred in shipping enterprises under the Ministry of 
Communications, on cargo boats belonging to local transport 
departments, on cargo boats of villages and townships, and on 
ferries, i.e., accidents of a kind more serious than the common 
shipping accidents, a decline of 18.4 percent compared to the 
preceding year. They killed 557 persons, which is about the same 
number as in the preceding year, and 37 of the boats or ships 
involved sank, which was a decline of 2.3 percent, compared to 
the preceding year, while economic losses were 147 million yuan, 
an increase of 13.2 percent over the preceding year. During 
1993, there had been nationwide three first-grade accidents and 
two second-grade accidents of China Airways, and there had been 
two first-grade air accidents and two second-grade air accidents 
in general aviation. 
  With the intensified reform of the labor system, the system 
of settling labor disputes has been gradually perfected. In 
1993, the labor dispute arbitration committees at all levels 
handled 12,658 labor disputes, an increase of 51.6 percent over 
the preceding year, and involving 34,794 employees and workers, 
an increase of 99.8 percent over the preceding year.

5030 0068) and Lu Wen (4151 2429), CPC Central Committee Policy 
Research Office and Ministry of Agriculture Jointly Operated 
Permanent Rural Observation Site Office: "Survey of Peasant 
Occupational Differentiation"] 
  [Text] In 1992, the Permanent Observation Site Office 
conducted a special survey of peasant occupational 
differentiation through 312 permanent rural observation sites in 
29 provinces (autonomous regions, or cities) located throughout 
the country. 
<H5>  1. Current Status of Peasant Occupational Differentiation </H5>
  The survey showed that more than a decade of reform has 
demolished the peasants' single occupation status of the 
people's commune era. Today, the peasants have the freedom to 
change their status and select an occupation. The employment 
structure has undergone marked changes. 
  This survey divided peasant occupations into 10 categories 
as 
follows: 
  1) Peasant laborers. This category consists 
primarily of peasants who contract the use of collective land 
for farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and the fishing 
industry, all or most of their income coming from agriculture. 
They may be further divided into those who work solely in 
agriculture, and those who work mostly in agriculture but also 
in some other industry. 
  2) Peasant workers. These are peasants who work 
all year round, or most of the time, in township and village 
collectively owned enterprises and state-owned enterprise units 
doing jobs in secondary or tertiary industries. 
  3) Township and village collective enterprise 
managers. These are plant directors and plant managers, as 
well as people who head up laboratories, and supply and 
marketing personnel in township and village (or group) 
collectively owned enterprises. They are the people who hold 
administrative and management authority and decision making 
authority in enterprises. 
  4) Individual or partnership industry and business 
workers and business persons. These are laborers engaged in 
nonagricultural labor and business in industries, 
transportation, businesses, or food and beverage services in 
which the means of production or money are individually owned or 
owned in partnership. These industries and businesses may have 
hired workers, but they have not yet attained the status of a 
privately owned enterprise. 
  5) Operators of privately owned enterprises, i.e., 
owners of privately owned businesses. A privately owned 
enterprise is one in which an individual or partners own the 
means of production, in which mostly hired labor does the work, 
in which all or most after-tax profits go to the owners of the 
means of production, and that are rural economic entities of 
substantial size. Specifically, a privately owned enterprise: 1) 
hires eight or more workers (including apprentice workers); 2) 
has fewer than eight worker but has assets (fixed assets and 
working capital) of more than 50,000 yuan; 3) is a partnership 
in which the number of hired workers is greater than double the 
total amount of family manpower put into the partnership, and 
whose assets are worth more than 50,000 yuan. 
  6) Hired laborers. This means laborers who work 
year round, or most of the year, as laborers in a noncollective 
and nonstate owned enterprise unit such as a privately owned 
enterprise, an individual owned enterprise, or a partnership 
industry or business. These laborers do not have enough land or 
other means of production to make a living by themselves. 
  7) Township and village cadres. This term applies 
to township and village cadres who do administrative leadership 
and management tasks year round, or most of the time. For the 
most part, they do not have production jobs. Most draw a fixed 
wage or enjoy a fixed allowance. 
  8) Workers in education, science and technology, 
medical treatment and health care, culture and the arts. 
These are peasants and intellectuals engaged in intellectual 
occupations in rural villages. 
  9) Houseworkers. This term applies to laborers who 
do house work year round and who do not engage in production for 
the most part. 
  (10) Other laborers. This means workers other than 
those in the above nine categories, such as laborers having no 
fixed occupation. 
  Inasmuch as houseworkers do virtually no work in production, 
since other laborers have no relatively fixed occupational 
status, and since township and village cadres and workers in 
education, science, medical treatment, and the arts are groups 
that have not newly appeared since reform, they are not the 
principal focus of this article's analysis. 
  Thus, the current spread of the rural work force is as shown 
in Table 1.

  The foregoing table shows that large amounts of rural 
manpower have left agricultural production to work in secondary 
and tertiary industries. Most of the manpower that has left 
agriculture has flowed in one of two directions. First, it has 
gone into township and village collectively owned enterprises 
and state-owned enterprise units. A relatively small 5.2 percent 
has gone into nonagricultural work such as in state-owned 
enterprise units, while a much larger percentage has gone into 
township and village collective enterprises. Second, it has 
flowed mostly into the individually or privately owned economy. 
This category of laborers is comprised largely of the owners of 
the owners of privately owned enterprises, and the owners and 
hired workers in individual or partnership industries or 
businesses. The number of people who have gone into state-owned 
enterprise units, township and village collective enterprises, 
and the private economy total 28.3 percent of the 
nonagricultural population. The development of township and 
village enterprises and the individually and privately owned 
economy has played an important role in the shift of 
agricultural manpower. Gender plays a definite role in rural 
manpower's selection of an occupation. This is manifested 
largely in a much larger percentage of females than males 
leaving production to do housework. However, except for the old 
and the physically impaired, virtually all males are involved 
directly in production activity. Among agricultural laborers, 
females employed solely in agriculture account for 45 percent of 
total manpower in this category, 4.9 percentage points more than 
males. However, in the various nonagricultural occupations, the 
percentage of males is higher than females. 
  The occupational situation in the country's three main 
regions as shown in Table 2 suggests that the percentage of the 
rural work force working as agricultural laborers increases from 
the eastern to the central and western regions of the country. 
Correspondingly, the percentage of nonagricultural laborers is 
largest in the eastern region. The nonagricultural manpower in 
township and village collective enterprises (the peasant workers 
in township and village collective enterprises, and managers in 
township and village collective enterprises) is 31.8 percent in 
the east, 26.8 percent in the central region, and 23.2 percent 
in the West. In the eastern region, those who have become 
owners of privately owned enterprises in the individual and 
private economy, or operators and hired workers in individual or 
partnership industries or businesses number 31.8 percent of the 
nonagricultural work force. It is 23.8 percent in the central 
region and 26.8 percent in the western region. 
  In the eastern region, the peasant occupational structure 
shows a fairly marked nonagricultural shift, and the collective 
and privately owned economies play an equally important role in 
soaking up nonagricultural manpower. In the western region, the 
tilt of the occupational structure toward other than agriculture 
is reactively slight. The percentage of agricultural laborers is 
relatively high, and the percentage of nonagricultural manpower 
flowing into township and village collective enterprises is 
relatively low. In the central region, the situation is in 
between that of the eastern and western regions. By comparison 
with the western region, township and village collective 
enterprises soak up a comparatively large amount of the work 
force; however, the role of the individual and private economy 
in soaking up manpower is relatively slight.

  The survey shows a definite correlation between the degree 
of 
socio-economic development and the occupational structure. We 
can observe this from the village per capita income level (See 
Table 3).

  Table 3 shows that in areas where per capita income is high, 
the percentage of peasants in nonagricultural occupations is 
relatively high and vice versa. The percentage of village 
laborers having a net per capita income of more than 1,500 yuan 
is lowest, and the percentage of those engaged purely in 
agriculture is even less, amounting to only 14.6 percent of 
rural manpower. However, in the group making a net per capita 
income of less than 400 yuan, they number 60.2 percent, the 
highest group of all. In the group making between 600 and 800 
yuan, they number 50.7 percent. Township and village enterprises 
are fairly well developed in villages where people have a net 
per capita income of more than 1,500 yuan. These township and 
village enterprises employ 52.1 percent of non-agricultural 
manpower as peasant workers and managers. Private enterprise 
owners, individual or partnership industry or business 
operators, and hired laborers account for 27.9 percent of 
nonagricultural manpower. In the 600-800 yuan group, township 
and village enterprises employ 34.7 percent of nonagricultural 
manpower as peasant workers and managers, and private enterprise 
owners, individual or partnership industry or business 
operators, and hired laborers account for 26.5 percent of 
nonagricultural manpower. In the below 400 yuan group, the 
percentages are 8.4 and 21.2 respectively. This shows a 
relatively high percentage of nonagricultural manpower in high 
income villages, an overwhelming majority of which has fairly 
stable employment, while in low income areas, the 
nonagricultural manpower percentage is very small, and a 
substantial percentage of it is not engaged in production 
activities. The role of collective enterprises and individually 
or privately owned economic components in absorbing surplus 
agricultural manpower is very limited, agriculture being the 
main occupation. 
  To summarize the foregoing, the peasant occupational 
structure at the present time may be capsulized as follows: 
  1. Rural reform has freed the peasants from the bondage of 
the people's commune system. As the rural economy develops, 
bringing steady changes in the industrial structure, some 
peasants have left agriculture for jobs in the nonagricultural 
sector. The substance of peasant employment has changed with 
reform, employment opportunities becoming more varied. 
  2. The occupational structure today has a marked 
transitional 
character. On the one hand, because of various limitations, most 
peasants remain on the land. Despite the large surplus labor, 
they are unable to transfer into secondary and tertiary 
industries. On the other hand, the manpower that has transferred 
out of agriculture still maintains countless ties with those who 
have not. They are still not secure in their jobs, where mergers 
are constantly occurring. The survey results show 0.7 persons 
per household surveyed as working in other than agriculture, 0.3 
of them working there for less than six months each year. 
Moreover, each time a change occurs in government policy 
orientation, a chain reaction is produced in the percentage of 
rural manpower employed in nonagricultural pursuits. 
  3. Occupational structure reflects an area's industrial 
structure, and differences in industrial structure make for 
differences between one area and another in peasant employment. 
In economically developed areas, nonagricultural industries are 
usually also fairly well developed, and the amount of manpower 
working in other than agriculture is substantial. However, in 
economically backward areas where agriculture still plays a 
dominant role, the occupational structure is also tilted toward 
agriculture. 
  4. Township and village collective enterprises, privately 
owned enterprises, and individual or partnership industrial and 
business households are the main outlets for surplus manpower. 
Collective enterprises are frequently fairly large and soak up 
substantial manpower. However, the number of such enterprises is 
fairly small, and they are very unevenly distributed. Although 
fairly small in size and absorbing little manpower, privately 
owned enterprises, and individual or partnership industrial or 
commercial households are fairly large in number and cover a 
wide area. Both of these economic components play a major role 
as outlets for the shift of manpower today. 
  5. From the standpoint of the peasants becoming prosperous, 
since they have a great radiating effect, township and village 
enterprises play a substantial role in bringing about joint 
prosperity for whole villages. That more than half of the 
non-agricultural manpower is employed in township and village 
collective enterprises in villages where net per capita income 
is above 1,500 yuan provides good testimony to this. The 
radiating effect of privately owned enterprises and individual 
or partnership industrial and commercial households is small by 
comparison, so their role is not as large as that of township 
and village collective enterprises. Their effect on the rural 
economy is expressed largely through their demonstration effect 
on villagers. 
<H5>  Main Reasons for Peasant Occupational Diversification </H5>
  The main reason for the diversification of peasant 
occupations since the advent of reform has been the shift into 
other than agriculture and other than the publicly owned economy 
of agricultural laborers who contracted collectively owned land. 
Therefore, six occupational changes in the primary industry and 
secondary industries should be the main emphasis of this 
analysis. Reduction in the number of agricultural laborers is 
the starting point for peasant occupational differentiation. 
  Many factors account for peasant occupational 
differentiation. There are both internal reasons and objective 
reasons, both historical reasons and practical reasons, and both 
general reasons and special reasons. Summation of all the 
factors leading to the main reasons for peasant occupational 
differentiation today may be understood from the following 
several aspects. 
  (1) Economic Development Is the Basic Animus for 
Peasant Occupational Differentiation 
  Economic development has its own inherent objective 
necessity. The contemporary economic development process is a 
process of change that has gone from primarily an agricultural 
economy to primarily an industrial economy, from primarily a 
rural village economy to primarily an industrial economy, from 
primarily a rural economy to primarily an urban economy, and 
from primarily a natural economy to primarily a commodity 
economy. The diversification of peasants occupations is an 
important ingredient of this process. 
  The direct force powering this process is rise in 
agricultural productivity. The widespread use of improved breeds 
and crop varieties, increase in material inputs such as chemical 
fertilizers, agricultural pesticides and agricultural plastic 
film, a rise in the degree of mechanization, improved capital 
construction of agriculture, perfection of the agricultural 
services system, etc. have brought a rise in both the soil 
productivity rate and the labor productive rate, thereby setting 
the stage for a shift in agricultural manpower. This survey 
shows that 72.8 percent of villages have centrally organized the 
supply of improved breeds and crop varieties, that chemical 
fertilizer use totals 84.43 tons per village, or 34.78 kilograms 
per mu of cultivated land; that mechanization averages 1,014.58 
horsepower per village, meaning that 57 percent of the total 
cultivated land area is machine cultivated today; and that 83 
percent of villages have centrally organized medium and small 
farmland capital construction, year-end effective irrigation and 
drainage ditches averaging 6,533.89 meters per village for the 
irrigation of 56.4 percent of the total cultivated land area 
during the year. Improvement of the agricultural services system 
has not only improved working conditions, but has also saved 
manpower. Among rural agricultural laborers surveyed, females 
already outnumber males, and the educational level of 
agricultural laborers is also fairly low; however, neither of 
these factors impairs bumper agricultural harvests. On the 
contrary, they set the stage for male manpower and manpower of 
relatively high caliber to take part in nonagricultural 
production. 
  Agricultural production is characterized by seasonality. The 
widespread existence of long periods of surplus agricultural 
labor is also a basic factor in the long history of rural 
sideline occupations, and it also makes possible the holding of 
separate jobs. The survey shows that 30.6 percent of 
agricultural laborers hold a second job, and that only 42.8 
percent of the rural work force works solely in farming. The 
experience of some economically developed areas shows that the 
shift of manpower out of agriculture usually goes through three 
stages: farming alone, two jobs other than farming, and 
concentration on a single occupation. Since China has scant 
resources for agriculture, and a large population relative to 
available land, surplus manpower exists in every rural village. 
This produces inherent pressure for peasant occupational 
differentiation. This survey shows only 3.08 mu of cultivated 
land per rural capita, and each person engaged in farming 
cultivated 5.49 mu. Idle rural manpower runs to 286.45 per 
village, or 36.4 percent of total manpower. 
  Different occupations and differences in income from 
different occupations play a guiding role in peasant 
occupational diversification. Results of a sampling of 10 
percent of the high income families among all peasant families 
based on a 1991 ranking by per capita income showed: Forty-two 
percent of the high income peasant households were from among 
households operating privately owned enterprises primarily; 25 
percent came from households engaged mostly in individual or 
partnership contracting of collective enterprises; 18.3 percent 
came from households engaged primarily in running partnerships; 
and 8.6 percent came from households operating family 
businesses, for the most part. Clearly, the percentage of high 
income households from the operation of family businesses mostly 
was lowest. The number of high income households in various 
occupations as a percentage of all households was as follows: 
4.5 percent in farming (3.5 percent of them from grain farming), 
8.7 percent in forestry, 14.1 percent in animal husbandry, 12.5 
percent in the fishing industry, 27.4 percent in industry, and 
28.6 percent in construction. Very clearly, the percentage of 
high income households engaged in farming, for the most part, 
was the smallest. 
  (2) Economic Policy Readjustments Since the Advent of 
Rural Reform Have Given Tremendous Impetus to Peasant 
Occupational Differentiation 
  The sidelining of surplus agricultural manpower resulting 
from increases in agricultural productivity, the surplus labor 
time and the surplus manpower employment pressures resulting 
from the shortage of agricultural resources, which characterize 
agricultural production, as well as the different occupations 
and the differences in income from different occupations are 
things guiding the shift of manpower out of agriculture and 
inherent causes of economic development, most of which have not 
just come into being. However, rural reform brought new changes 
and new combinations of these factors that have hastened peasant 
occupational diversification. 
  Before reform, rural villages practiced a highly centralized 
planned economy management system in which the peasants had no 
right to make their own production decisions and no division of 
labor and trades, to say nothing of occupational diversity. The 
peasants were shackled to the limited amount of land to produce 
enough food to eat. "Taking grain as the key link, cutting out 
all else" was a true picture of agricultural production. Commune 
members were agricultural laborers virtually all of whom looked 
alike. Following reform, the peasants became relatively 
independent producers and operators. They had the right to make 
their own production decisions. They could choose what they 
would farm, how they would farm it, and ways to become rich. 
Consequently, more and more peasants devoted themselves to 
commodity production, left the land without leaving the village, 
headed for cities, and engaged in economically diversified tasks 
using different operating methods under different forms of 
ownership. The rise of nonagricultural industries and a nonstate 
owned economy was the basis reason for peasant occupational 
differentiation. As a result of rural reforms approximately 
one-half of the agricultural manpower under the traditional 
system has changed, or is in process of changing, occupation. 
  (3) Socio-economic environment Is an Important 
Condition Affecting Peasant Occupational Differentiation 
  Why is it that the degree of occupational differentiation 
differs substantially in different areas and different villages 
despite the same policies? This can be explained only in terms 
of the objective conditions such as socio-economic environment 
and availability of resources.

  Peasant occupational diversification increases from west to 
east. Agricultural laborers as a percentage of total manpower is 
70.8 percent in the western region, 65.6 percent in the central 
region, and 57.0 percent in the eastern region. Clearly it is a 
result of the socio-economic environment in the different 
regions, which causes a stratification in the extent of peasant 
occupational diversification. The macroenvironment in open 
coastal regions, in particular has an extremely great affect on 
peasant occupational differentiation. In addition is the 
difference in topography, and differences in social environment 
and natural resources, which, generally speaking, affects 
peasant occupational diversification. However, it is only in an 
appropriate socio-economic environment that natural resources 
conditions can become transformed into real productivity. 
Peasant occupational differentiation is related to the degree of 
economic openness, the degree to which the commodity economy has 
developed, and the degrees to which the nonagricultural economy 
has developed. Without convenient transportation, and without 
the present of important things such as money, markets, 
facilities, technology, and information, which is to say that if 
the socio-economic environment is not very good, it is difficult 
to make most of advantages in plentiful natural resources. 
  (4) Personal Traits Are the Decisive Element in Peasant 
Occupational Differentiation 
  In the final analysis, peasant occupational differentiation 
comes down to peasant personal economic behavior. Ultimately the 
inherent force of economic development, the powerful impetus of 
economic policies, and the important influence of the economic 
environment have to be realized through the peasants. The 
peasants personal traits play a decisive role in occupational 
diversification. Take the three major areas of China as an 
example. In the eastern region, the level of education of rural 
manpower is higher overall than in the central and western 
regions. It is lowest in the western region. This is consistent 
with the progressive decrease east to west in the extent of 
peasant occupational differentiation (See Table 4). Using the 
same method to survey the average degree of peasant education in 
all occupations surveyed, one can see that the peasant that have 
differentiated into various occupations all have higher 
educations that agricultural laborers, hired employees and 
houseworkers who do not engage in production activities 
excepted. (See Table 5). Those having a higher degree of 
education update their ideas faster, more readily learn special 
skills, and have greater ability to adjust to their external 
environment. 
  Changes in thinking lead to changes in behavior. Some 
peasants who have skills and ability have separated from the 
mass of agricultural laborers to take a road toward riches. This 
survey shows that most of those who have become rich first today 
have diversified out of agricultural labor. As to how they were 
able to get rich first, 56 percent of the peasants feel that 
they either had a special skill or they had a head for economics 
and business.

  [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] and the State 
Administration of Taxation [SAT] decided the other day to lower 
the value-added tax rate on farm products from 17 percent to 13 
percent, temporarily exempting grain, edible oil, pesticides, 
and chemical fertilizer from value-added taxes before the end of 
1995. 
  MOF and SAT provided in a "Circular on Adjusting 
Farm-Product 
Value-Added Tax Rates and Exempting Certain Items from 
Value-Added Taxes" that the following goods will be exempted 
from value-added taxes before the end of 1995: 1) Grain and 
edible vegetable oil sold by state-grain commercial enterprises 
to the military and by state-grain retail enterprises to urban 
residents; 2) feed 3) agricultural plastic film; 4) ammonium 
bicarbonate, common calcium superphosphate, and calcium 
magnesium phosphate produced and sold by chemical-fertilizer 
production-enterprises, and urea, phosphamidon, and phosphamidon 
sulphate produced and sold by small chemical-fetilizer 
enterprises that have changed from their former production of 
ammonium bicarbonate, common calcium superphosphate, and calcium 
magnesium phosphate; 5) Dipterex, DDVP, Rogor, parathion, 
xinliulin, acephatemet, acetyl acephatemet, hybrid-rice blast, 
shachongshuang, fenitrothion, marathion, aluminum phosphide, 
weed-eradication ether, grade-D weed-amine, and Rogor oxide 
produced and sold by pesticide-production enterprises; 6) 
wholesale and retail seeds, seedlings, chemical fertilizer, 
pesticides, and farm machinery. 
  It is understood that this adjustment was studied and 
planned 
based on the State Council's "Summary of Meeting To Study 
Pertinent Issues Since Tax-Revenue Reform Plans Went Into 
Effect." Finance and tax bureaus in all areas will begin to 
enforce these new provisions on 1 May 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Cui Jinghua (1508 0079 5478): "Results of a </F>
First-Quarter Spot-Check by the State Technology Supervision 
Administration Show That the Quality of Agricultural Materials 
Is of Concern"] 
  [Text] The State Technology Supervision Administration 
announced on 25 April 1994 the results of a state-supervised 
spot check during the first quarter of 10 categories of 
agricultural materials and products in 22 provinces 
(municipalities). The spot check showed that China's current 
agricultural-production situation is of concern, with a quite 
severe product-quality problem. 
  This spot check involved 353 products in 10 categories, such 
as seeds, pesticides, and farm machinery parts, produced by 216 
enterprises, with 157 products being up to standard, for a 
sampling up-to-standard rate of 44.5 percent. This included 
up-to-standard rates of 92.6 for long-effective phosphorus 
agricultural chemicals, 88.95 percent for pesticides 
(herbicides), such as buta-weed-amine, 81.9 percent for 
three-wheeled farm-use transportation vehicles, 64.3 percent for 
upright slush and sewage pumps, 57.7 percent for triazole-ketone 
pesticide, 56.3 percent for cotton seeds, 42.9 percent for 
fungus-clearing pesticides, 42.1 percent for rotocultivator 
curved-blade paddy-field harrows, 35 percent for 
bromide-cyanogen ammonia-ester milk-oil, and 2.8 percent for 
corn seeds. 
  This shows that seed quality was most severe, with only 30 
of 
156 corn and cotton seed samples from 89 sales units in seven 
provinces being up to standard, for a sampling up-to-standard 
rate of 19.2 percent. Of 108 corn-seed samples, 88 hybrid seeds 
did not have a purity of the (minimum) national standard of 
grade two, with only three of 20 self-crossed seed samples being 
up to standard as to purity; 19 of 48 cotton-seed samples did 
not reach purity criteria. In the two provinces of Shanxi and 
Henan, not even one of 42 samples from 18 enterprises were up to 
standard, with the "Nongda 60" seeds from a seed company in the 
southern suburbs of Taiyuan, Shanxi not meeting standards for 
all four inspection targets.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhang Zichen (1728 1311 5256): "The Ministry of </F>
Agriculture Points Out That the Task of Prime Importance To 
Achieve Higher Grain and Cotton Yields Is To Ensure Planting 
Areas"] 
  [Text] What is China's current grain- and cotton-production 
situation? A recent Ministry of Agriculture [MOA] summary 
shows that a higher grain yield will be hard to achieve, with 
recovery of our cotton output being very difficult. MOA notes 
that to achieve our 1994 targets of stabilizing our grain output 
and increasing our cotton output, the task of prime importance 
will be to take steps to ensure their planting areas. The major 
immediate problems are: 
  -- The planned area sown to grain is likely to be below the 
warning line. The planned-area figures reported by the farm 
sector from all areas show that the area sown to grain in 1994 
will be 1.64 billion mu, down 11 million mu from the 
actually-sown area in 1993, and below the 1.65-billion-mu 
emergency-warning line. This includes a drop of about 10 
million mu for the 15 northern provinces, municipalities, and 
autonomous regions; by variety, the sown area will be down 
around 7 million mu for wheat, and 13 million mu for early rice 
in the south. While a recovery-type expansion of 2 million mu is 
expected, it will be hard to achieve a larger pickup. 
  -- While the area planted to cotton is up, a large gap with 
plans remains. Since the cotton-purchasing price was raised, 
the initiative to cultivate cotton in cotton-growing areas has 
picked up somewhat. But while the cotton area is up 6 million mu 
from 1993 to 81 million mu, there is still a clear gap between 
this area and 1994 plans, making the conflict between production 
and marketing hard to ease. 
  Faced with such a grim grain- and cotton-production 
situation, MOA holds that the current priority is to emphasize 
the planting of "two large areas." 
  1. While consolidating our northern grain area, the 1994 
grain area and output stability throughout China will be largely 
dependent on a large part of the burden being borne by southern 
paddy rice. We need to guide and encourage qualified areas to 
expand their "two-hybrid" grain areas, actively disseminating a 
new combination of high-yield, quality, hybrid rice, in an 
attempt to sharply recover the planting area in 1994 for paddy 
rice, particularly early rice. 
  2. We need to fight a "tough battle" to recover our cotton 
area in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. The 
cotton output of these three provinces makes up about one-half 
of China's. As our national cotton area in 1993 was down 30 
million mu from 1992, with 75 percent of the drop being in these 
three provinces, the implementation of the cotton-planting area 
in these three provinces in 1994 will be of key importance to 
our national output. We need to plant well and fully existing 
bare and leftover spring areas, with qualified areas 
appropriately increasing their summmer cotton, by actively 
cultivating cotton on wasteland. All areas need to better 
oversee and manage agricultural capital goods markets, strictly 
curbing arbitrary price rises, and firmly cracking down on the 
production and sale of fake and shoddy agricultural capital 
goods, to safeguard peasant interests and stimulate peasant 
initiative to plant cotton. 
  In an attempt to reach state targets for 1994 cotton-area 
recovery to 90 million mu and gross output of 97 million dan, 
certain cotton-producing provinces have taken a series of stiff 
steps. In addition to emphasis by the leadership, their 
increased fund input and prompt provision of the goods and 
materials needed for spring planting have played a key role in 
expanding the area sown to cotton. A recent itemized report by 
the responsible state sector shows that the following provinces 
have won initial successes. 
  Jiangxi Province has completed its 1994 planned task of 
planting 2.6 million mu, up nearly 700,000 mu from 1993 (and 
similarly hereinafter); Hubei Province has expanded by 200,000 
mu, for an overall area of 7.5 million mu, mainly in 
two-membrane early cotton; the two provinces of Hebei and 
Shandong have initially increased their areas by more than 10 
percent, with Hebei's plans for a cotton acreage of 8.45 million 
mu implemented down to prefectures and counties. Liaoning 
Province has increased its area by 390,000 mu, and Henan's 
planned acreage is up 600,000 mu. 
  The pickup in cottonfield acreage in the above provinces was 
due to the following two practical measures. 
  1. These provinces increased their fund input in cotton 
production. For instance, Hebei provided financial allocations 
of 51 million yuan in support of cotton planting. Meanwhile, the 
Agricultural Bank and the credit-cooperative system raised 280 
million yuan in special loans focused on cotton-planting 
preparations. The provincial government also decided to set 
aside 2 million yuan as a cotton-incentive fund; Shandong 
continued to spend 4 million yuan for high-yield cotton 
development; the Jiangxi provincial government decided to take 
12 million yuan from cotton-incentive funds assigned outside of 
the province in 1993 to use for cottonfield water conservancy; 
Shandong's Dezhou region supported 30 priority cotton townships 
with 100,000 yuan each in revolving funds. 
  2. They actively organized goods supplies, promptly 
providing the materials needed for spring cotton planting and 
the whole year's production. In Jiangxi Province, where more 
than 5 million kg of cotton seeds were needed, they took steps, 
such as importing improved varieties, providing adequate seeds, 
as well as the fertilizer and loans to households needed for 
cotton planting; certain counties and cities in Hubei have 
supplied peasants with related items, such as fine seeds, dual 
film, herbicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizer; Hebei has 
supplied 45,000 tons of farm-use diesel oil at parity price in 
the first quarter, with priority going to cotton planting.

<F P=106> [Commentator article: "The Existing Problems With the </F>
Quality of Imported Grain Need Attention"] 
  [Text] From January 1993 to March 1994, the port of 
Dalian imported grain from overseas and Hong Kong in three 
varieties and 3,715 batches, for an overall volume of 
1.371486518 tons, of which 2,041 batches were up to standard, 
involving 1.031657668 tons, or 75 percent, while 674 batches 
were substandard, involving substandard grain imports of 
348,828.85 tons, or 25 percent of the delivered volume. The 
inspection and appraisal of grain imports by Liaoning's 
Commercial Inspection Bureau at the port of Dalian show that 
imported grain is subject mainly to the following quality 
problems: 
  1. Substandard product imports make up quite a large 
percentage. From January 1993 to March 1994, the port of Dalian 
imported 3,715 batches of grain, for a gross volume of 
1.371486518 tons. Through strict and legal inspection by 
Liaoning's Commercial Inspection Bureau, it was discovered that 
674 of these batches were substandard grain imports, involving 
substandard grain imports of 348,828.85 tons which, calculated 
by quantity, meant a substandard grain-import rate of 25 
percent. 
  2. Certain batches have even more severe quality 
problems. For instance, from January 1993 to March 1994, we 
imported from the U.S. 984 batches of wheat, for a gross volume 
of 495,120.894 tons, of which Liaoning's Commercial Inspection 
Bureau found 671 batches to be substandard, for a total 
substandard volume of 348,016.85 tons, or 70.29 percent of all 
wheat imported from the United States. Meanwhile, we imported 
from Mongolia two batches of barley, for a volume totaling 560 
tons. Inspection by Liaoning's Commercial Inspection Bureau 
found that both batches of barley imported from Mongolia were 
substandard products. The reasons for this were: 1) the 
germination percentage did not conform to contract provisions; 
2) the inner quality was worse than the outward appearance. For 
both of these substandard grain imports, the Liaoning Commercial 
Inspection Bureau promptly signed and issued documents stating 
that they were substandard, turning them over to the concerned 
parties for foreign damage claims. As to the existing quality 
problems in grain imports at the port of Dalian, the Liaoning 
Commercial Inspection Bureau has made the following suggestions: 
  1. For grain imports, concerned departments must 
present damage claims as quickly as possible to overseas firms 
based on the damage-claim documents signed and issued by the 
commercial inspection sector, retrieving the Chinese side's 
economic losses as soon as possible, to protect the Chiness 
side's legitimate rights and interests. 
  2. All departments in charge of grain imports, when 
signing contracts with overseas firms for grain imports, must 
act in line with international practice, by setting forth 
clearly and in detail grain-import variety, grade, volume 
(weight), quality, packaging, and inspection damage-claim terms. 
The terms must be set forth clearly and in detail, with no 
ambiguity, and inspection terms having clear inspection grounds, 
as well as reasonable damage-claim validity periods and quality 
guarantees. 
  3. All grain-import consignment and user units, when 
receiving overseas grain imports from now on, must take the 
initiative to promptly submit them for inspection to 
commercial-inspection organs at the stipulated times and sites, 
being allowed to sell and use them only after the 
commercial-inspection sector has inspected and signed and issued 
documents certifying that they are up to standard. If they are 
sold or used without being inspected by the commodity-inspection 
sector, when quality problems are discovered, and the 
claim-damage periods have expired, there is no way to claim 
damages from foreign firms, which is bound to create unnecessary 
economic losses for the consignment and user units, as well as 
for the broad masses of consumers. 
  These suggestions by the Liaoning Commodity-Inspection 
Bureau should be brought to the attention of all concerned 
parties which, just like the business commodity-inspection 
sector, should combine management with inspection to do a strict 
job of guaranteeing grain-import quality.

Department, State Planning Commission: "Analysis of the 
Attainment of a Chinese Peasant Net Per Capita Income of 1,200 
Yuan in 2000"] 
  [Text] Development economics maintains that growth is the 
prerequisite and foundation for development. This has been 
attested to in the practice of economic and social development 
in every country of the world. A comparatively well-off standard 
of living is a new development stage that the Chinese people 
face now that the subsistence problem has been solved. It is 
also the ideal and the goal of the broad masses of people for 
improvement of their livelihood by 2000. Rural villages hold the 
key to the whole country's attainment of a comparatively 
well-off standard of living; and rise in peasant income is the 
key to rural villages attainment of a comparatively well-off 
standard of living. What is the minimum peasant income that must 
be attained for rural villages to have a comparatively well-off 
standard of living? Put another way, what is the base line for a 
comparatively well-off rural standard of living? This article 
seeks to make a preliminary analysis of the correlation between 
increase in peasant income and a comparatively well-off peasant 
standard of living, and to specify how to set a rural 
comparatively well-off line. 
<H5>  Preliminary Assessment of Peasant Income Situation </H5>
  (1) Substantial Increase in Peasant Real Income. 
Within the short space of little more than a decade, peasant net 
per capita income has continuously increased first from 200 to 
400, and then to 600 yuan. Income growth, which formerly derived 
primarily from farming, now comes from a combination of farming, 
livestock breeding and aquaculture, and from the all-around 
development of farming, industry, and business. 
  Changes in production methods have spurred the development 
of 
agriculture. Outputs of principal farm products have increased. 
Not only do they satisfy the production and livelihood needs of 
the broad masses of peasants, but large surpluses greatly 
accelerate the commercialization of agriculture. At the same 
time, the broad masses of peasants have been freed from the 
shackles of traditional agriculture in active response to the 
new development of rural commodity markets. While producing 
grain and cotton according to national plan, they strive to open 
new production avenues and ways to increase income through the 
development of economic diversification. In 1978, peasant net 
per capita income was only 134 yuan; by 1980, it increased to 
nearly 200 yuan. This increase in peasant per capita income 
within two years was equal to the net increase in peasant per 
capita income for the entire 24 year period from 1954 to 1978. 
The increase from 200 to 400 yuan took only five years (1980 
-1985), and the increase from 400 to 600 yuan took four years 
(1985-1989). In 1990, peasant net per capita income reached 686 
yuan for a 2.6 fold increase over 1980. After deducting for 
price increases, this was an average annual 6.3 percent 
increase. The entire 1980s was the decade of fastest rural 
economic development, and it was also the decade in which 
peasant net per capita income increased fastest, and in which 
peasant living conditions improved most. 
  Rural economic development changed the sources of income 
growth. In 1978, prior to rural reform, rural society's 
production activities were largely under leadership of people's 
communes and consisted primarily of the growing of staple farm 
crops such as grain and cotton. Rural commodity production and 
commodity business had no place; the peasants engaged solely in 
agricultural production; their net per capita income derived 
almost entirely from agricultural production; and the income 
from agricultural production derived, in turn, from the rural 
collectives' equal distribution. In 1978, when peasant net per 
capita income was 134 yuan, more than 80 percent of it came from 
agricultural production. Operating system reforms centering 
around the output-related contract responsibility system, and a 
series of reform policies that the state adopted in order to 
spur rural commodity production and commodity exchange greatly 
aroused the interest of the broad masses of peasants in rural 
commodity production and circulation. With the fairly rapid 
growth in gross output of farm products, rural secondary and 
tertiary industries also began to boom, and sources of peasant 
income also diversified. Now, income came not only from unified 
collective farming but also from family farming that the 
peasants did themselves. It came not only from farming, but also 
from secondary and tertiary industries for a change of pattern 
in which agricultural production and non-agricultural production 
were equally important. Comparison of the late 1980's with the 
late 1970's showed that income from uniform collective farming 
as a percentage of peasant net per capita income had declined 
from 60 to about 9 percent, and income from peasant household 
activities had increased from 30 to 83 percent. Income derived 
from agriculture fell from 81 to 63 percent; and income from 
other than agriculture rose from 8 to 28 percent. The portion of 
peasant net per capita income increase derived from other than 
agriculture increased markedly, rising 23 percentage points. 
Meanwhile, during the same period, the portion of income derived 
from agricultural production declined 17 percentage points. 
  (2) Marked Widening of the Peasant Income Distribution 
Gap Encouraging some people to become rich first is an 
important policy that both the party and government have 
consistently advocated during the new era. This policy has 
played a tremendous role in encouraging "capable people" in 
rural villages to come forward, which had advanced development 
of the rural commodity economy. Accompanying economic growth 
has been a marked trend toward differentiation among individual 
peasants, peasant families, and the economy of different 
regions. The economic gap between one person and another, 
between one peasant family and another, and between one region 
and another has been readjusted, resources being reallocated. 
While adhering to unflagging implementation of plans and 
policies for "some people becoming rich first," one must also 
realize that a widening trend exists in the rural peasant income 
gap. 
  1. Widening of the income gap among different peasants. The 
Gini coefficient is commonly used internationally as an 
indicator for judging the degree of income equilibrium. The Gini 
coefficient's numerical value lies between 0 and 1. A numerical 
value of 0 means absolute balance; a numerical value of 1 means 
absolute imbalance. The greater the numerical value the greater 
the imbalance in income. State Statistical Bureau research data 
show that in China's rural villages, the Gini coefficient may be 
divided into four areas: "Below 0.2 shows high balance; 0.2-0.3 
shows relative balance; 0.3-0.4 shows equitable distribution; 
and above 4 shows a fairly large gap." In 1980. the Gini 
coefficient for peasant income was 0.24; in 1985, it was 0.26; 
and in 1990, it rose further to 0.31. The entire 1980s was a 
period in which peasant income was relatively equal and 
developing toward rational distribution. The income gap among 
different peasants has changed from the former not very great 
difference toward marked difference. For the broad masses of 
peasants who have "shared poverty and wealth," and egalitarianly 
"eaten out of a large common pot" for so long, facing up to the 
present reality is rather painful. Furthermore, since an 
overwhelming majority of those peasants who have become rich 
first did so not by just growing grain and cotton, or by 
developing agricultural production but by developing industrial 
sideline occupations, by engaging in commodity circulation, or 
by going off to work elsewhere, this has somewhat intensified 
the disgruntlement of grain and cotton growing peasants. In 
1990, peasant household income for the country as a whole 
exhibited an "inverted U" pattern. Needy households having a net 
per capita income of less than 300 yuan numbered 8.59 percent; 
households having a net per capita income of between 300 and 
1,000 yuan numbered approximately 73.63 percent; and high income 
households having a net per capita income of more than 1,000 
yuan numbered 17.78 percent. 
  2. Regional differences exhibited a widening trend. Natural, 
historical, and geographic factors produced an eastern, central, 
and western zone pattern of rural economic development. As the 
gap in the overall economic development of the three zones 
widened during the 1980s, regional differences in peasant net 
per capita income showed a widening trend. In 1980, the peasant 
net per capita income ratio of the eastern, central, and western 
economic zones was 1.39:1.11:1 (taking the western zone as 1). 
In 1985, it was 1.54:1.21:1; and in 1991, it widened further to 
1.71:1.06:1. 
  In terms of income category, widening of the difference 
between the highest income provinces and the lowest income 
provinces was even more marked. In 1980, the ratio of the 
highest income to the lowest income was 2.79:1. By 1990, it 
widened to 4.71:1. Simultaneous with the widening of the income 
gap between one region and another, even within the same region 
differences in income also exhibited a widening trend 
attributable to differences in the geographical environment, 
differences in the level of organization and management, and 
differences in technology and human resources. Even in the 
relatively developed eastern region, as the pace of economic 
development quickened, a "relative hardship situation in 
economic development" occurred in some areas. In the central and 
western regions, such hardship situations might be considered 
comparatively well-off or rich. According to data from Zhejiang 
Province, Yinxian County in Ningbo, which ranked nineteenth 
among the 100 strongest counties in the country, the gross 
industrial output value of some towns such as Wuxiang, 
Jiangshan, and Gulin reached 500 million yuan, and even as much 
as 1 billion yuan, yet the output value of some other towns was 
less than 100 million yuan. Net per capita income there was as 
high as more than 2,000 yuan, and as low as only 600 yuan. Among 
villages, differences were even greater. The gross output value 
of industry and agriculture in villages that had developed 
rapidly was more than 100 million. In slowly developing 
villages, it was less than 100 million, and some places were 
insolvent. The regional economic returns gap became the force 
behind the shift of surplus rural manpower out of these areas. 
The greater the gap became, the stronger the impetus for rural 
manpower to flow into developed areas. Inevitably this produced 
transportation and employment strains, which increased developed 
areas' development pressures, and sapped undeveloped areas 
development vitality. 
  3. Steady Widening of the Gap Between Cities and the 
Countryside. In order to hasten industrialization, ever since 
the founding of the people's republic the government has pursued 
a "price scissors" policy in agriculture and rural villages, 
which has widened the differences between city and countryside. 
Prior to 1980, the government instituted a low wages system for 
city staff members and workers, and practiced an egalitarian 
"work points system" form of distribution in rural villages, so 
the difference between city and rural wages was not great, nor 
were the historical differences between city and countryside 
much improved. During the early 1980s, city and town residents' 
income was about 1.8 times peasant income. Rural reform and 
decontrol, and rural economic development further narrowed the 
difference between city and countryside. Between 1980 and 1984, 
city and town residents' income increased 6.2 percent each year 
while peasant earnings increased by an annual 16.7 percent, 
thereby narrowing the gap between cities and the countryside by 
5.6 percent. City and town residents' income was 1.7 times 
peasant income. However, after 1985, the ratio between city and 
countryside residents' income changed, city and town resident's 
income continuing to increase faster than peasant income. In 
1985, city and town residents' income grew 1.6 percentage points 
faster than peasant income, but in 19.86 it increased 14.9 
percentage points, and by 1990, the gap between city and 
countryside income widened from the 1.8:1 of 1982 to 2.2:1. The 
income gap was just one evidence of the gap between city and 
countryside. An even greater difference existed between city and 
countryside social welfare and social security. Peasant advances 
in education, medical care, housing, and employment derived 
mostly from the peasants themselves and the rural collective 
economy, but in cities, they came largely from state financial 
support. For the broad masses of peasants who had only just 
extricated themselves from poverty and achieved a subsistence 
standard of living, fine education and medical care could only 
be dreams. 
  (3) Overall Peasant Income Level Still Fairly Low 
Proper assessment of the peasants' income situation is a 
prerequisite and the foundation for a correct evaluation of the 
rural economic situation leading to formulation of rural 
economic policy. Since the advent of reform and opening to the 
outside world, peasant income has risen substantially, the 
standard of living has improved markedly, and a large number of 
"upper income people" have appeared. The number of peasant 
households having an annual net per capita income of more than 
2,000 yuan went from zero in the early 1980s to around 4.7 
million, or about 22.5 million people. The appearance of rural 
"upper income people" generated a misconception in society. 
Seemingly, all the peasants had become wealthy. Actually, these 
"upper income people" accounted for only 2.11 percent of all 
peasant households, or about 2.51 percent of the rural 
population nationwide. They were an extremely small minority in 
rural villages. Overall, peasant households making a net per 
capita income of between 300 and 1,000 yuan per year were the 
largest percentage. Peasant net per capita income differs from 
city and town residents' income. It has its own distinctive 
character. First, peasant income is seasonal. Most of peasant 
net per capita income comes from agricultural production, and 
the seasonality of agricultural production means that peasants' 
income is seasonal. However, city and town residents' income is 
mostly wage and salary income obtained monthly. Second, some 
peasant income is spent for productive purposes. The income that 
peasants obtain not only has to be used for their own 
consumption, but also for family-run reproduction activities. By 
contrast, city and town residents' income is used largely for 
consumption and savings. In addition, the payments they make for 
housing and medical care as part of consumption are affected by 
the national welfare system. For the same level of support they 
pay less than the peasants pay. Therefore, in judging the amount 
of peasant income, one must pay attention mostly to the amount 
of income remaining after the peasants take care of their 
subsistence needs. 
  Survey data verify that after deducting peasant consumer 
spending, the peasants have only enough income left to maintain 
simple reproduction. Therefore, the overall peasant income level 
remains fairly low. Actually, in 1990, peasant per capita living 
expenses were 585 yuan, 13 yuan lower than their theoretical 
expenditures. One sensible explanation for this is that in order 
to sustain and develop agricultural reproduction, the peasants 
cut back on immediate consumption to increase investment in 
production and savings. 
<H5>  2. Increased Income Is the Key to a Rural Comparatively </H5>
Well-Off Standard of Living 
  The journey from a subsistence to a comparatively well-off 
standard of living is a historical development process. During 
this historical advance, as the people's standard of living 
rises, consumer ideas and consumer demand changes 
correspondingly. Once subsistence problems have been solved, 
peasant income is elevated to the main position in the weighing 
of rural economic development objectives. 
  (1) Increasing the agricultural work force's returns is 
the main line in development of the rural economy during the 
1990s. If one says that increasing outputs of main 
agricultural products was the main line in development of the 
rural economy prior to the 1980s, then the main line in 
development of the rural economy during the 1990s is increasing 
the returns of workers in all rural trades and industries. 1) 
This stems from the way in which agriculture develops during the 
new era. The efforts made during the 1980s largely solved the 
subsistence problems of the people in rural villages and 
throughout the country as a whole. Not only do outputs of the 
main agricultural products satisfy the needs of the people of 
the whole country, but a certain amount of surplus has appeared. 
People's consumption patterns have also changed qualitatively, 
so the main emphasis in agriculture has shifted from quantity to 
quality. Changes in the development of agriculture mean that 
agriculture must follow a course in which its survival depends 
on the returns it provides, and its development depends on the 
quality it provides. During the 1990s, economic returns will 
become the most direct motivation for the broad masses of 
peasants to work in agriculture. 2) The rural socialist market 
economy system makes this so. During the 1980s, enormous 
successes were scored in development of the rural economy. These 
provided the basic framework for the rural socialist market 
economy system. The rural reform that began during the end of 
the 1970s enabled the broad masses of peasants to take the lead 
in becoming urban workers. They gained the right to select their 
own employment, becoming relatively free professionals. Because 
of the too large a number of peasants engaged in agriculture, 
large numbers "went south," "went north," or "headed west" where 
they engaged in non-agricultural activities, thereby forming a 
large nationwide rural manpower market. This lay a foundation 
for founding of the rural market economy system. A fundamental 
reason for the substantial development of the rural commodity 
economy during the 1980s was the state's planned decontrol of 
agricultural product markets, gradually reducing and eliminating 
fixed national prices for some agricultural products. The state 
eliminated the centralized procurement and assignment 
procurement system, replacing it with state fixed procurement 
and free buying and selling in markets. By 1990, except for some 
grain and cotton prices that the state continued to set, the 
marekt mechanism determined an overwhelming majority of 
agricultural product prices. The prosperity and development of 
rural markets spurred an increase in the degree to which rural 
villages became commodity economies and money economies. By 
1990, the commodity rate for agricultural and sideline products 
reached 62.9 percent, up 8.5 percentage points from 1980. 
Peasant cash receipts and expenditures also rose from 53.5 
percent in 1980 to 76 percent in 1989, a 22.5 percentage point 
increase. Money became the main medium through which the 
peasants sustained and developed production and their 
livelihood, and commodity production became the most direct goal 
of peasant production. (3) Necessity for consolidating the 
worker-peasant alliance. The peasants' interests have always 
been the main factor in rural and social development whether 
during land reform or in the rural reforms of the 1980s. 
"Adjustment and protection of the peasants' interests are 
implicit motivations in rural reform and the development of 
agricultural productivity." Adjustment and protection of the 
peasants' interests, and narrowing the differences between city 
and countryside are the foundation for consolidation of the 
worker-peasant alliance, and they are also objective 
requirements for building a distinctively Chinese brand of 
socialism. Without rural development, development of the urban 
economy, and even the entire national economy, is unimaginable. 
Unless the peasants, who account for 80 percent of the country's 
total population, achieve a comparatively well-off standard of 
living, the people of the whole country cannot achieve a 
comparatively well-off standard of living. Unless the far-flung 
rural villages attain a comparatively well-off standard of 
living, a comparatively well-off standard of living in cities is 
difficult to imagine. Widening of the gap between city and 
countryside is a most direct and most glaring indication of the 
widening of the gap between city and countryside residents' 
income. Not only does this affect the stability of rural 
society, but also will have a serious impact on urban life. The 
uneven development manifested in the decline of rural villages 
and the one-sided prosperity of cities that has occurred in the 
industrialization process in developed capitalist countries, 
which has not only restricted further development of the 
national economy but also has given rise to serious social 
problems should be heeded. 
  (2) The key indicator of a comparatively well-off 
standard of living is peasant net per capita income. A 
comparatively well-off standard of living is a new stage of 
development that the Chinese people face following complete 
solution to their subsistence problem. It is a development phase 
that must be gone through on the way from subsistence to wealth. 
It is an objective necessity for realizing the second strategic 
objective of national economic and social development during the 
1990s. The goal of attaining a comparatively well-off standard 
of living is a comprehensive socio-economic development goal 
that includes the economy, the society, and the environment. 
Peasant net per capita income is an important indicator listed 
in the rural comparatively well-off standard of living indicator 
system that all jurisdictions and departments concerned have put 
forward. Its weighting ranks it first among all indicators. 
Increase in peasant income is a prerequisite and the foundation 
for rural attainment of a comparatively well-off standard of 
living. Increase in peasant income lays a solid material 
foundation for a rise in peasant productive capacity and 
consumer purchasing power. It also gives impetus to early 
realization of other indicators of a comfortably well-of 
standard of living. Nevertheless, peasant income increase is 
only a requirement for realization of a comparatively well-off 
standard of living. Economic growth does not always bring an 
increase in social welfare and social progress, and economic 
growth frequently occasions economic phenomena such as 
environmental pollution and relative poverty. It may also 
occasion a loss of social precepts and ethics. 
<H5>  A Peasant Net Per Capita Income of 1,200 Yuan Is a Basic </H5>
Requirement for Rural Attainment of a Comparatively Well-Off 
Standard of Living 
  Proposal of a Rural Comparatively Well-Off Line. 
The idea of a rural comparatively well-off line means that 
peasant net per capita income has reached the minimum limit for 
being comparatively well-off. This is to say that peasant net 
per capita income must at least reach a certain standard value 
in order to realize a comparatively well-off rural standard of 
living. 
  1. The national rural comparatively well-off line is 1,200 
yuan per capita. Currently, society has two opinions about a 
comparatively well-off rural standard of living. One is 
represented primarily by the State Statistical Bureau, which 
holds that in 2000 the rural comparatively well-off line will be 
1,100 yuan, figured at 1990 prices. This is 414 yuan more than 
the 686 yuan of 1990, an annual 4.8 percent increase. The other 
is represented primarily by the State Planning Commission, which 
maintains that the rural comparatively well-off line in 2000 
will be 1,200 yuan figured at 1990 prices. This is 514 yuan more 
than in 1990 for an annual 5.8 percent increase. We feel that 
1,200 yuan as a rural comparatively well-off line is about 
right. 1) A look at requirements for a rural comparatively 
well-off standard of living suggests that the rural Engels' 
coefficient will have to fall below 50 percent for rural 
villages to attain a comparatively well-off standard of living. 
For peasant per capita consumption expenditures to reach about 
1,000 yuan, peasant net per capita income will have to reach at 
least 1,200 yuan. 2) A look at possibilities for rural economic 
development suggests that the main sources of increase in 
peasant income will be agricultural production and the 
development of rural township and town enterprises. According to 
an analysis of data for the 12 year period 1979-1990, increase 
in peasant net per capita income was very much related to the 
gross output value of agriculture and the number of people 
employed in township and town enterprises. Is agricultural 
production and the development of township and town enterprises 
up to the heavy task of bringing the rural comparatively 
well-off line up to 1,200 yuan? The answer is affirmative. In 
view of the requirements of the 10-year plan for rural economic 
development and of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, by 2000, the gross 
output value of agriculture will increase more than 4 percent 
each year. The gross output value of township and town 
enterprises will increase 11 percent, soaking up 47.45 million 
rural laborers in 10 years and bringing the number employed in 
such enterprises to 140 million in a 51.1 percent increase over 
1990, a 4.2 percent annual rate of increase. Without taking 
price factors into account, the gross output value of 
agriculture will increase 4 percent each year; thus, peasant net 
per capita income will increase 3.12 percent each year, i.e., a 
cumulative 37.4 percent in 10 years. A 4.2 percent annual 
increase in the number of people employed in township and town 
enterprises will mean a 0.77 percent annual increase in peasant 
net per capita income, i.e., a cumulative 7.96 percent in 10 
years. All in all, at the planned speed of increase, by 2000 
peasant net per capita income will increase 45.4 percent to 997 
yuan through the development of agricultural production and 
expansion of employment in other than agriculture. This is 83.1 
percent of the rural comparatively well-off line, somewhat more 
than 200 yuan short of the requirement for a rural comparatively 
well-off standard of living. Moreover, the gap can be narrowed 
only by accelerating the pace of economic development. For the 
people of the whole country and the broad masses of peasants to 
attain a comparatively well-off standard of living by the end of 
the present century, the speed of rural economic development 
swill have to be increased. The development speed that the "10 
Year Plan and the Eight Five-Year Plan propose will have to be 
amended. Following the high speed development of the 1980s, 
agricultural production gradually entered a mature stage during 
which economic growth was flat and in which maintenance of 4 
percent growth was about right. Following three years of 
improving the economic environment and rectifying the economic 
order between 1989 and 1991, the speed of development picked up 
somewhat. Under the policy of accelerting development, 
development speed should have been somewhat faster, and manpower 
shuold have been absorbed faster too. Preliminary calculations 
show that at an annual 25 percent increase in the value of 
township and town enterprises (i.e., 14 percentage points higher 
than the 11 percent of the original plan), the township and town 
enterprise annual rate of employment increase should reach 9.55 
percent, boosting the peasant annual net per capita income rate 
of increase by 1.75 percentage points. When increased income 
from the development of agriculture is added in, the peasant net 
per capita income rate of increase rises 4.87 percentage points, 
i.e., a 10 year cumulative 60.9 percent increase, peasant net 
per capita income reaching more than 1,100 yuan. The income that 
laborers obtain through direct production activities comes to 
91.7 percent of the rural comparatively well-off line. The 
remaining approximately 9 percent can be obtained through other 
nonproduction activities. (3) The trend of historical 
development shows that after deducting for price increases, 
agricultural production increased 6.3 percent during the 1980s, 
a speed higher than necessary to reach the rural comparatively 
well-off line. Township and town enterprise growth reached 30.5 
percent, including the relatively slow 25 percent speed of 
growth during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period. This was also 
higher than or equal to the speed of growth required to reach 
the rural comparatively well-off line. An increase in peasant 
net per capita income from 686 yuan in 1990 to 1,200 yuan in 
2000, a 5.8 percent annual increase but still lower than the 63 
percent growth of the 1980s, is realizable with effort. 
  2. The comparatively well-off line in high income areas is 
1,500 yuan. For middle income areas, it is 1,200 yuan, and for 
low income areas it is 1,000 yuan. The area divisions used in 
this article are based on China's actual rural development. The 
division is based on the peasant mean net per capita income data 
for each province for 1990 and 1991. The two year mean, which 
eliminates annual peculiarities, increases the credibility of 
the regional division. 
  The whole country is divided into three categories. In the 
first, peasant net per capita income ranges between 800 and 
2,000 yuan. This applies to eight provinces (or municipalities), 
including Shanghai, Beijing, Zhejiang, Tianjin, Guangdong, 
Jiangsu, Liaoning, and Fujian (ranked by income from high to 
low, and the same applies hereinafter). In these eight provinces 
(or municipalities), the peasant mean net per capita income is 
1,162 yuan, which is close to the national average rural 
comparatively well-off line. These three areas are concentrated 
in three large cities and developed coastal areas. In the second 
category, peasant net per capita income is between 600 and 800 
yuan. This applies to 12 provinces (or autonomous regions), 
including Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Hainan, Xinjiang, 
Jiangxi, Tibet, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, Hebei, and Inner 
Mongolia. In these 12 provinces or autonomous regions, the 
peasant mean net per capita income is 687 yuan, which is equal 
to the peasant net per capita income nationwide in 1990. An 
overwhelming majority of these provinces (or autonomous regions) 
are principal grain and cotton growing areas. They are 
representative of agricultural provinces nationwide. In the 
third category, peasant net per capita income runs between 400 
and 600 yuan. This applies to 10 provinces or autonomous regions 
including Shanxi, Ningxia, Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan, Shaanxi, 
Anhui, Guizhou, and Gansu. The peasant mean net per capita 
income for these 10 provinces or autonomous regions is 531 yuan. 
Most of these areas are concentrated in large agricultural 
provinces throughout the county, and in poorly developed areas 
of western and southwestern China. This includes Guizhou and 
Gansu province in which peasant net per capita income has not 
yet reached 500 yuan. At 450 and 439 yuan respectively, this is 
the lowest level in the country. 
  One cannot directly determine the separate area rural 
comparatively well-off line by using the peasant mean net per 
capita income. An evaluation of purchasing power is also needed 
to eliminate the effect of area price differences. A so-called 
purchasing power evaluation means readjusting the income of 
different areas by using a standard purchasing power to make 
incomes more comparable. The income of the second category 
regions, which corresponds to the national average may serve as 
the standard purchasing power. 
  Rural monetary purchasing power and the rural retail price 
index show a reciprocal correlation. As the price index rises, 
purchasing power declines; as the price index declines, 
purchasing power rises. In order to eliminate the effect of 
prices insofar as possible when evaluating purchasing power, 
selection of 1978 as the base year for the rural price index is 
rather appropriate inasmuch as rural reform began in 1978. Prior 
to 1978 (including 1978) China practiced a low wage, low price, 
and limited rural commodity economy development policy whereby 
the rural price level differed greatly from place to place 
throughout the country. The rural reforms of 1978 consisted 
primarily of an increase in farm product prices. The reforms had 
relatively little effect on the rural retail price index for 
that year. Calculations yield a purchasing power for category 1 
areas that is 91.76 percent of standard purchasing power. 
Peasant net per capita income after adjusting prices is 1,065 
yuan. In order to reach the national rural comparatively 
well-off line in 2000, at the peasant net per capita income 
increase, the rural comparatively well-off line will be 1,579 
yuan, which is rounded down to 1,500 yuan. The category 2 areas 
are at the national mean where the rural comparatively well-off 
line is 1,200 yuan. In category 3 areas, where purchasing power 
is 103.32 percent of standard purchasing power, peasant net per 
capita income after adjusting prices is 548 yuan. Using as a 
standard the peasant net per capita income increase needed to 
reach the national rural comparatively well-off line, the rural 
comparatively well-off line for this category is 1,062 yuan, 
which has been rounded down to 1,000 yuan. 
  (2) Favorable Conditions for Reaching the Rural 
Comparatively Well-Off Line. Attainment of the rural 
comparatively well-off line requires maintenance of an annual 
5.8 percent increase in peasant net per capita income, which 
corresponds to the 1992 increase. Nationwide, three favorable 
conditions exist for attainment of the rural comparatively 
well-off line: 
  1. The rural economy will maintain steady increase; 
potential 
exists for further development. This is the basic underpinning 
for peasant income increase. The gross output value of 
agriculture will maintain a 5 percent growth rate during the 
first three years of the 1990s (1990-1992) at comparable prices. 
For the next eight years, increase in the gross output value of 
agriculture will not be less than 4 percent. The reasons are as 
follows: 1) As the basic industry in the national economy, 
agriculture will receive close attention from the party and 
government for a long time to come, and support will be provided 
in many ways, such as through legislation and administration, to 
develop agricultural production and to readjust and protect the 
peasants' interests, which will promote steady development of 
agricultural production. 2) Agricultural production holds 
tremendous potential. Two-thirds of the country's cultivated 
land consists of medium and low yield fields. Reserve resources 
also exist in the form of large amounts of barren mountains, 
unexploited water surfaces, and undeveloped flats. With full 
development for agriculture, they provide substantial potential 
for increased yields and increased income. 3) The structure of 
agriculture is facing readjustments. Use of science and 
technology to invigorate agriculture, development of high yield, 
premium quality, and high return agriculture, and increasing the 
added value of agricultural products have become the common 
cause of the broad masses of peasants. 
  2. Smooth reform of the farm products circulation mechanism 
will give impetus to the formation of a second upsurge in 
agricultural production. The government's gradual decontrol of 
procurement and marketing controls on main farm products such as 
grain and cotton, and guidance given the broad masses of 
peasants to enter the marketplace have accelerated the general 
adoption of market principles in rural areas. This will generate 
extremely great interest and impetus among the broad masses of 
peasants to develop commodity production and take part in market 
competition. It will bring about early completion of the task of 
readjusting the structure of agricultural production, thereby 
increasing peasant income. In addition, the grain reserve system 
and the wholesale market mechanism that the government has set 
up create a fine macroeconomic climate for the development of 
agriculture that will enable smooth reform and development of 
agriculture. 
  3. Accelerated development of township and town enterprises, 
and speedy urbanization of rural villages have given powerful 
impetus to a shift in surplus rural manpower, thereby promoting 
a tremendous rise in peasant income. The urbanization of rural 
villages and the development of rural tertiary industries 
provide new employment opportunities for the transfer out of 
agriculture of rural surplus manpower. In 1992, the gross output 
value of township and town enterprises reached 1.7643 trillion 
yuan, or one third of gross social output value. The annual rate 
of increase was more than 30 percent. Development of the rural 
economy has accelerated the movement of enterprises and funds to 
key cities and towns, and transportation centers. The 
development of rural small cities and towns has become the main 
vehicle for future enterprise concentration and the shift out of 
agriculture of rural surplus labor. It also enables rural 
tertiary industries to abandon scattered operations in favor of 
more centralized operations that offer the economies of scale. 
It may be safely predicted that rural manpower will move into 
non-agricultural industries on a larger scale and concentrate in 
small rural cities and towns. 
  3) Analysis of Difficulties in Reaching the Rural 
Comparatively Well-Off Line. Peasant income increases 
slowly, thereby adding to pressures for reaching the rural 
comparatively well-off line. The past five years of rural reform 
have seen the fastest increase in peasant income, which has 
grown at an average 15.1 percent per year. Between 1985 and 
1988, it declined 4 percent, and for three years beginning in 
1989 peasant income remained in limbo. Despite 1989's all-time 
high grain output, after deducting for price rises, peasant net 
per capita income was 1.8 percent less than for the previous 
year. This was the first year of negative growth since the 
advent of reform and opening to the outside world. In 1990, 
peasant income increased only 1.8 percent over the previous 
year. In 1991, it increased 2 percent over the previous year. 
From 1989 to 1991, it increased only an average 0.7 percent. 
Only nine years remain between now and the end of the present 
century. If peasant income increases at 2 percent per year, by 
2000, only half the rural comparatively well-off line can be 
completed. Attainment of the rural comparatively well-off line 
of 1,200 yuan by 2000 will require a 6.2 percent increase in 
peasant per capita income, which is 0.4 percentage points more 
than the originally prescribed plan, and 0.4 percentage points 
higher than the actual 1992 increase. Second, the shift out of 
agriculture of rural surplus manpower is crucial to peasant 
income increase, and it is also the key to realizing a 
comparatively well-off rural standard of living. Today, 
approximately 100 million of China's 430 million work force are 
in a state of "hidden unemployment" in agricultural production. 
In addition is the 100 million rural labor force that will be 
added over the coming decade, so that by the end of the present 
century surplus rural manpower will increase to 200 million. 
Attainment of the comparatively well-off line in rural villages 
requires an annual shift of more than 13 million members of the 
rural work force into other lines of work. This means a shift of 
130 million over the next 10 years, thereby increasing the 
number of people employed in township and town enterprises to 
more than 220 million. Such a large scale transfer is 
unprecedented since founding of the people's Republic. During 
the 1980s, for the first time large numbers of the rural work 
force entered nonagricultural industries, which grew on a fairly 
large scale at fairly high speed, an average of 6.3 million 
members of the work force entering them each year. Transferring 
surplus rural manpower during the 1990s at twice the 1980s scale 
and speed will pose substantial difficulties. Third, the 
peasants' burdens are fairly heavy, thereby adding to the 
difficulty in realizing a comparatively well-off rural standard 
of living. The increase in peasants' burdens is essentially an 
erosion of peasant's income, which has the effect of seriously 
sapping peasant's ability to improve and develop production. 
Peasant household survey data show that between 1985 and 1990, 
peasants' burdens nationwide (including only state taxation and 
collective withholdings) rose from 18.40 yuan to 38.20 yuan per 
capita in a 1.1 fold increase, or at an annual 15.7 percent. 
During 1989 and 1990, in particular, the per capita rate of 
increase in burdens exceeded the per capita net income rate of 
increase, the increase being respectively 15.5 and 12.3 percent 
higher than peasant per capita net income. Even more serious is 
the excessive increase in unreasonable rural fund raising and 
assessments, which exceed the nationally prescribed 5 percent. 
Peasant income increases with no increase in benefits. 
<H5>  4. Various Policy Ideas for Increasing Peasant Income </H5>
  (1) Updating Thinking, Making Readjustment and 
Protection of Peasants Interests the Main Line in the 
Development of Agriculture and the Rural Economy During the 
1990s. The establishment and development of a socialist 
rural market economy system puts an interests mechanism at the 
heart of rural economic development. Protection and 
readjustment of peasants interests for a narrowing of the gap 
between cities and the countryside is a basic requirement for 
the building of a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism. The 
inauguration and implementation of reform measures including 
readjustment of the agricultural production structure, 
developing high yield, premium, and high return agriculture, 
reforming the agricultural product procurement and marketing 
system, improving the socialist market economy mechanism, etc. 
as the market requires cannot be done successfully without the 
active participation of the broad masses of peasants. Unless the 
peasants' interests are protected, not only will the peasant's 
income level and standard of living be adversely affected but, 
more importantly, peasant interest in developing production and 
taking part in reform will be impaired. Thus, this is not an 
economic issue but a political one. Therefore, during the 1990s, 
the emphasis of rural economic development and rural work has to 
shift from product output to the protection and readjustment of 
peasants' interests. It must change to increasing the income of 
rural laborers. 
  (2) Maintaining the Continuity of Existing Policies To 
Consolidate the Agricultural Foundation Provides the Most Basic 
Underpinnings for Steady Increase in Peasant Income. 
Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Greater 
government protection and intervention in this foundation is 
extremely necessary during the new situation in developing a 
socialist market economy. On the one hand, a good job must be 
done in carrying out all policy measures. Actions must be taken 
in accordance with the provisions of "Agricultural Law of the 
People's Republic of China," the decisions of the Fourteenth 
Party Congress' decisions on the development of a socialist 
market economy, and the spirit of the Central Committee of the 
Rural Work Committee, using "Program for the Development of 
Chinese Agriculture During the 1990's" as a blueprint for 
maintaining continuity in rural economic policies, for giving 
substance to all policies and measures, for paying sincere and 
wholehearted attention to agriculture, for removing peasant 
apprehensions, for protecting and increase peasant interest in 
developing agricultural production and the rural economy, for 
wholeheartedly developing agricultural production and the rural 
economy, for increasing peasant income, and for creating a 
relaxed policy environment for realization of a comparatively 
well-off rural standard of living. On the other hand, 
governments at all levels must be encouraged to improve the 
agricultural infrastructure, to increase investment, to improve 
agricultural production conditions, to improve ability to 
prevent and withstand disasters, and to increase reserve 
strength for development. 
  Readjustment of the Agricultural Production Structure 
for the Development of High Yield, Premium Quality, High Return 
Agriculture Is an Important Way To Increase Peasant Income. 
  Development of agriculture by emphasizing returns is the 
outstanding feature of agriculture during the 1990s. The State 
Council's "Decisions on Accelerating the Development of High 
Yield, Premium Quality, and High Return Agriculture" provides 
policy support for the development of "Three Highs" agriculture. 
The key problems existing today as the peasants orient toward 
the market, readjust the production structure, and develop 
"three highs" agriculture is the general existence of new ways 
to increase income, and worries about market risks. In the 
process of developing the market economy, government has not 
stood idly by but rather has done what needs to be done. Even in 
developed capitalist countries, government regulation and 
control of agricultural production, and protection of the 
interests of farmers is fairly complete. The government must 
become the leader and the protector in the peasant's development 
of a socialist market economy so that the rural market economy 
changes gears smoothly. Right now, it must pay close attention 
to model pilot projects in "three highs" agriculture, exploring 
new avenues for development of the four combinations, namely 
farming, breeding, and processing; agriculture, industry, and 
commerce; domestic and foreign trade; and agriculture, science, 
and education, readjusting the agriculture production structure, 
and increasing peasant income. 
  Accelerating the Development of Township and Town 
Enterprises, and Accelerating Transfers Out of Agriculture of 
Surplus Rural Manpower Is the Key To Increasing Peasant 
Income. The success or failure of rural economic 
development plans depends on whether more than 200 million 
surplus rural workers can be transferred out of agriculture. 
Whether the goal of a comparatively well-off rural standard of 
living can be smoothly attained also hinges on this. The 
development of township and town enterprises, and the widening 
of rural employment avenues are necessary for an increase in 
peasant income. First, the enterprise equity rights system must 
be improved. Establishment of a township and town enterprise 
microeconomic operating basis that is consistent with the modern 
enterprise system requires step-by-step, planned development of 
township and town enterprise equity rights registration work to 
clarify the enterprise equity rights situation. Experiences in 
the reform of the joint-stock system and the cooperative shares 
system, which is already underway, must be summarized promptly, 
and better guidance provided for gradual standardization of the 
systems. Second is faster development of township and town 
enterprises in central and western China. Special funds for the 
development of township and town enterprises must be managed 
well and used well as State Council "Decisions on Accelerating 
Development of Central and Western Township and Town 
Enterprises" requires, to raise the level of development of 
township and town enterprises in those areas. Third is the need 
to do a good job of building small rural cities and towns to 
hasten the urbanization of rural villages. National government 
agencies concerned must draw up rural small city and town 
development plans, making the building of small cities and towns 
the center of current economic and cultural activity. Fourth is 
the need to speed up the development of rural tertiary 
industries. This is a major way in which to soak up surplus 
rural labor. Fifth is putting scientific and technical progress 
to use in increasing the competitiveness of township and town 
enterprises. 
  (5) Improvement of the Rural Products Circulation 
System, Establishing an Agricultural Protection Mechanism Is an 
Important Support for Increasing Peasant Income. First is 
the need to speed up the growth of the rural commodity 
circulation system. Supply and marketing cooperatives are the 
basic rural commodity circulation organizations. They are the 
main channels for the circulation of agricultural products. The 
supply and marketing system reforms of the past several years 
have begun to show results. While continuing the role of rural 
supply and marketing cooperatives, people in all walks of life 
and individual peasants must be encouraged to set up rural 
commodity circulation organizations in order to convert product 
strengths into commodity strengths that spur the development of 
rural commodity production. Second is further perfection of the 
basic infrastructure for commodity circulation including 
national reserves and wholesale markets to provide strong 
support for development of the rural market economy. The 
building of agricultural products wholesale markets must become 
the focus in fostering and improving agricultural product 
markets during the 1990s, energies concentrated on doing a good 
job of it. While summarizing experiences and perfecting the 
present wholesale markets, a "Wholesale Market Law" should be 
drawn up with all possible speed to establish wholesale markets 
as leaders in the business realm, particularly for fresh foods, 
using legal means to standardize and promote the development of 
wholesale markets. Third is the need for further perfection of 
the ceiling price procurement system, to control the degree of 
rise in prices of the means of agricultural production and to 
narrow the "price scissors" between industrial and agricultural 
products. 
  (6) Concentration of Forces To Carry Out an Assault To 
Assist the Needy and Bring About Development. More than 80 
million people in China have still not found a long-term 
solution to their subsistence problems, most of them living in 
high mountain and border areas, and in frequent natural disaster 
areas. Others live in old revolutionary base areas and minority 
nationality areas. The State Council has set a seven year period 
for solving the subsistence problems of these 80 million people, 
i.e., the "Eighth Seven-Year Assault Plan To Support the Needy." 
We must continue a good job of work-relief programs, stick to 
development plans to assist the needy, reshape the economic 
development mechanism in such areas, improving their 
self-invigorating mechanism to ensure victory in the assault. 
  (8) Reduction of Peasant Burdens. Both the party 
and the government have drafted a series of policy measures to 
reduce peasant burdens, and limits on peasant burdens have also 
been written into law. The law clearly provides that no unit may 
increase peasant burdens on any pretext, peasant burdens to be 
held within 5 percent of previous year peasant net per capita 
income. Now the key lies in implementation. We must act in the 
spirit of the Central Rural Work Conference to improve 
leadership and supervision, making reduction of peasant burdens 
an important task in development of the rural economy during 
1990 and realizing the goal of a comfortably well-off standard 
of living, putting it on the government's daily work agenda, and 
paying unremitting attention to it.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhao Shukai (6392 2885 0481): "Let Peasants </F>
Enter Labor Market Freely"] 
  [Text] The superiority of the market system lies in its 
competitiveness. That is, a market system achieves the optimal 
allocation of resources through competition among the various 
major players on the market. When government regulates the 
market, the foremost objective should be to protect competition, 
that is, preserving a level playing field for all participants 
in market competition. As far as the labor market is concerned, 
a level playing field means that the worker has the freedom to 
enter or leave the market and the freedom to participate in 
market competition on his own worth. When government intervenes 
in the market not to protect such freedom but to decide whether 
a worker has the right to enter the market based on government 
wishes and to use administrative power to determine market 
choices, the resultant labor market will not offer a level 
playing field and is therefore not a genuine market. 
  In the current rural migration, rural workers spontaneously 
enter the labor market. At the same time, they also 
spontaneously create a labor market. Peasants entering the labor 
market and peasants creating a labor market are the two sides of 
one single process: the marketization of the employment 
mechanism. In this sense, rural migration may be described as an 
important engine of the marketization of the Chinese economy. 
Changes in the rural macroeconomic system have given peasants 
the freedom to operate and contract land on their own and the 
freedom to leave the soil and find work elsewhere. Through 
regional migration, such freedom has translated into the freedom 
to enter the labor market, which i a key source of the energy 
that has revitalized the rural economy, even the enter 
urban-rural economy. To consolidate and further the achievements 
of reform, we should protect this particular freedom for 
peasants. At a deeper level, this freedom is not yet whole, 
given the fact that peasants are still being hamstrung by a 
social personal management system truncated along urban-rural 
lines. It follows that to deepen reform, we must change the ID 
system that treats urban and rural areas differently. 
<H8>  1 </H8>
  A permit system for peasants who wish to work elsewhere has 
emerged in some areas in recent years. Under the permit system, 
a rural worker who wants to leave his village to find work in 
other places is required to apply to the county or township 
government for an "out-of-town work permit" (abbreviated 
hereafter as "work permit"). According to information from the 
agencies involved, if the examination and approval agency in the 
labor-exporting jurisdiction thinks the applicant has no 
well-defined job search objective, it may try to dissuade him 
from leaving and refuses to issue him a permit. Hiring units in 
importing jurisdictions hire workers on the basis of work 
permits; a person without a work permit would not be given a 
job. The system is most prevalent in several leading rural 
labor-importing and exporting provinces and regions in east 
China, south China, and southwestern China. Taking this practice 
one step further, some agencies have suggested that peasants be 
required to produce a work permit before they can buy a train 
ticket. These days the work permit system is being publicized by 
some in the mass media a major innovation in reform. Recently we 
went to the Zhu Jiang delta area in Guangdong, which has a heavy 
concentration of rural migrants from other provinces, to do a 
preliminary study. 
  Estimates put the non-local work force in Guangdong at 6.5 
million, 10 million if we include the floating population on the 
move between counties and municipalities in the province. 
Non-local workers are concentrated in the Zhu Jiang Delta area 
and large and medium-sized cities like Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and 
Zhuhai. Owing to the lack of statistical data, and because of 
the complex nature of the distribution of rural migrants, we do 
not as yet have a complete picture of the magnitude of the 
out-ogh[f-province work force in Guangdong consisting of workers 
with a work permit. Nor do we know how many enterprises in the 
province (including individual hiring units) require a worker to 
produce a work permit before hiring him. Our study mainly took 
the form of interview and focused on state enterprises, the 
three kinds of enterprises that are either wholly or partially 
foreign-funded, rural collective enterprises, individual private 
enterprises, as well as grass roots governments in such places 
as Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, and Shenzhen. In Zhongshan, 
according to people in charge of the municipal agricultural 
commission, township and town enterprises are required to demand 
that an outside worker produce a work permit as a condition for 
employment. However, township and town enterprises are 
themselves a complicated lot. It is hard to tell how many of 
them actually comply with this regulation. Comrades in Foshan 
told us the same story. We visited Foshan Electrical Lighting 
Company, Ltd., a large enterprise that has a rule explicitly 
requiring nonnative workers to produce a work permit. The 
enterprise has 5,000 workers, most of them from other provinces. 
In the workshop we interviewed several workers from Jiangxi, 
Hubei, and Guangxi, all of whom found work here on the 
recommendation of fellow villagers, classmates, or relatives and 
all of whom had work permits. Workers from southern Jiangxi said 
they were charged 200 yuan each to get a work permit back home. 
The rate was 60 yuan in Guangxi and 40 yuan in Hubei. We also 
visited two enterprises in Foshan, one of them an aluminum 
plant. A Sino-Hong Kong joint venture, it hired almost 1,000 
people, about one-third from outside Guangdong. The other was a 
Taiwan-funded knit sock factory with 500 employees, including 
more than 100 from outside Guangdong. According to a factory 
leader, no work permit was required. At the aluminum plant, a 
young fellow from Hengyang in Hunan Province told us it was 
possible to get a job there without a work permit. It would have 
cost him 60 yuan to get a work permit back home, so he simply 
decided not to get one. In Lishui township in Nanhai Shi, the 
township chief said there were 15,000 nonlocal workers in the 
township. To find a job in the township, a person must produce 
his ID card and a document certifying that he is unmarried (or a 
birth control card), but not a work permit. We also visited 
several individual private enterprises in the Zhu Jiang Delta. 
They required no work permit, not even an unmarried certificate 
(or birth control card). We checked out several large hotels, 
shopping centers, restaurants, clothing stores, and small shops 
in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. None of them required a work permit 
for hiring. For instance, neither Guangdong Guest-house in 
Guangzhou nor Jingdu Hotel in Shenzhen, three-star and four-star 
establishments, respectively, had a work permit requirement. 
  Our preliminary impression is that among enterprises in the 
public sector, a portion, but only a small portion, have indeed 
adopted the work permit system, but it is impossible to estimate 
how many enterprises actually do so. Among nonpublic 
enterprises, particularly miscellaneous private enterprises, 
such as small eateries, restaurants, clothing stores, and small 
shops, a work permit is not a prerequisite. As to whether there 
are individual enterprises which make employment conditional 
upon a work permit, we don't know. In terms of geographical 
distribution, places like Foshan and Zhongshan in the delta 
region do require a work permit, while large- and medium-sized 
cities like Shenzhen and Guangzhou do not. Nor do enterprises in 
the development zone in Guangzhou. 
  In determining whether or not a practice or system is 
necessary or appropriate, we cannot just look at the initial 
results. A sound practice or system may not produce satisfactory 
results in the early days of implementation, but that does not 
make it any less sound. In fact it may become more and more 
vital over time. A bad practice or system may be very vibrant at 
the beginning, but it could still remain a bad system or 
practice. The people's commune, for instance, took the nation by 
storm in just a few months, but this is no proof that it was a 
historically correct choice. It owed its explosive expansion 
primarily to its coercive adoption by administrative forces. In 
evaluating the work permit system, therefore, we cannot use the 
number of enterprises and localities that have adopted the 
system as a yardstick. What is even more important is to analyze 
the actual impact of its operation on social economic 
development. Is it consistent with the direction of 
marketization? Does it facilitate the creation of a market 
economy, particularly the healthy maturation of a labor market? 
<H8>  2 </H8>
  The system of requiring peasants who wish to leave home to 
find work to secure a work permit has been endorsed by some 
sectors. At one point we too considered it a good way to reduce 
haphazard migration and promote orderly migration. Armed with 
the results of our study and after listening to the opinions of 
enterprises and peasants, we reexamined the system from the 
perspective of the inherent requirements of the market economy 
and realized that the system should not be endorsed. We can go 
even further and say it may be an artificial impediment to the 
entry of rural workers into the market. 
  There was an objective background for the emergence of the 
work permit system. Rural migration that involves a massive 
number of peasants may cause extreme social stresses. To begin 
with, it has strained the rail and transport sectors to the 
breaking point. Migrants could not be successfully distributed 
and resulted in explosive concentrations. Secondly, importing 
areas were overwhelmed by the flood of migrants pouring in. Many 
workers could not find jobs right away, constituting an army of 
unemployed migrants and causing a string of problems. They are a 
source of concern for all society, particularly government. Some 
labor-exporting and importing areas got together to work out a 
solution. Hence the "work permit" system. A labor-exporting 
jurisdiction issues a permit at the end of an examination and 
approval process and lets a person go. The labor-importing 
jurisdiction hires people when they can produce a work permit. 
That way a basic balance is achieved between labor supply and 
demand, thus avoiding haphazard rural migration. Looking back 
now, we see that a lot of thought had gone into the system. Had 
a government plan been the principal mechanism for creating jobs 
for peasants, then such a system will invariably prove 
effective. However, the enterprise system has now changed. Just 
look at the hiring system alone. In the wake of the 
diversification of the organizational formats of enterprises, 
the employment practices of enterprises have also diversified. 
In a market economy, it is an enterprise's right to decide whom 
to hire. Suppose the person with no permit is the right person 
for the job in question while another person with a permit is 
the wrong man for the job. What should an enterprise do? On the 
other hand, rural migrants are not solely motivated to find a 
job in a particular enterprise. Many of them create their own 
employment opportunities. In effect what they do is to recommend 
themselves for a job, dispensing with the services of a 
recruiter. Under these circumstances, the work permit is bound 
to run into difficulties in practice. 
  The very design of the work permit is fraught with 
limitations. It is a mere reaction to rural migration. Its 
objective was to slow the tidal wave of rural migrants by 
limiting the peasant's freedom of movement. Such a government 
act, which revolves around restriction, overlooks the personal 
freedom peasants have won since reform went under way and 
ignores the employment autonomy enjoyed by enterprises in the 
wake of reform. It may have some positive effects, but is 
essentially negative and runs counter to the marketization of 
employment. 
  Although government agencies in some labor-exporting and 
importing localities work in concert to drum up support for the 
work permit system, things are largely beyond their control. 
Only very few employment areas fall within their sphere of 
influence. At the labor-exporting end, most rural workers about 
to join other rural migrants ignore the work permit system, 
leaving home as soon as they get hold of an ID card and applying 
for a work permit only as a last resort. At the labor-importing 
end, enterprises subject to extensive government intervention 
often have no choice but to go along with it reluctantly. As for 
enterprises beyond the reach of direct government intervention, 
they simply turn a blind eye to the system. Some governments at 
the grass root and autonomous organizations even consider it 
superfluous and refuse to cooperate with it. As a result, it is 
not surprising that the system has not been as effective as 
anticipated earlier in curbing haphazard migration. Judging from 
the situation in some township and town enterprises in the Zhu 
Jiang Delta, the decrease in the haphazard influx of rural 
migrants has more to do with self-regulation by peasants than 
with the functioning of the work permit system. 
  While the system's potential for good may not have been 
fully 
tapped, its adverse effect -- its direct erosion of the 
peasants' rights and interests -- has been surprisingly 
striking. In some localities, therefore, most peasants do not 
just dislike the work permit system but are vehemently opposed 
to it. First of all, it has made the economic burden on peasants 
even heavier. The typical labor-exporting area is an 
economically underdeveloped province or region where peasants' 
earnings are low to begin with. They shoulder a heavy burden and 
some are still struggling to feed and clothe themselves. When 
these peasants hit the road to join the rural migration, their 
main objective is to make a living. Yet local governments charge 
an exorbitant fee for issuing a piece of paper, lining the 
pockets of a department in the name of "bringing about orderly 
migration." Peasants interviewed complained about the 
unreasonableness of having to part with anywhere from 80 to 100 
yuan even before they could find out how much they could make by 
leaving home to look for work elsewhere. Some peasants said it 
really hurt to have to pay such a hefty sum for a document, 
considering that they could not even afford to send their 
children to school. Second, peasants' employment autonomy has 
been violated. In the past the people's commune controlled the 
peasant's personal freedom administratively. Since reform went 
under way, peasants have won the right to control their own 
labor autonomously. Should they stay on the soil and farm the 
land? Or should they go elsewhere to find work? This is a 
peasant's basic right as an independent commodity producer and 
operator. It is this right that has enabled peasants to utilize 
their talents in many fields and carve out a niche of the market 
economy for themselves ahead of others. Now government wants to 
reassert control over peasants through the work permit system. 
If they want to leave town, they need approval. If they want a 
permit, they need to pay a fee. This is tantamount to forcing 
peasants to buy their "migration right." Clearly this puts up a 
barrier to the development of a labor market. If we follow 
through with this logic, maybe peasants should also be required 
to obtain a permit before they can go to the city to buy food. 
What about urban workers? Should we demand that they obtain a 
permit too if they want to leave town to find work? Workers 
should enter the market like commodities--freely. The only 
difference is that the worker and his labor are inseparable, 
which is why the worker should have the necessary personal 
identification, namely the ID card. This is what is required 
under the universal law of the development of a capital goods 
market. If we mandatorily require a peasant to seek government 
approval before he can enter the labor market, we in effect 
reject the notion that the peasant is the master of his own 
labor. This would constitute a new discriminatory policy. 
  Some peasant workers disclosed that getting a work permit 
back home requires no examination-and-approval process. The only 
condition is that they pay a fee. Cough up the money and you get 
a permit. It all boils down to money. The permit-issuing 
department does not have the slightest interest in where the 
peasant is going or what he is going to do. The practice of 
requiring a peasant to enter "work permit" market before 
entering the labor market effectively negates the very rationale 
put forward by government for instituting the work permit system. 
<H8>  3 </H8>
  Some jurisdictions have been trumpeting the advantages of 
the 
work permit system as follows. For one thing, they say, by 
requiring peasants to apply for permission from and register 
with the government, we get a better knowledge of the peasants 
who join rural migration. For another, control by examination 
and approval will decrease the number of peasants who leave town 
without careful thinking. In fact, both arguments are 
problematic. First of all, if we are interested in gathering 
information, we need not go into the business of examination and 
approval, just report-filing and registration, functions that 
need not involve a government agency since the village committee 
or villagers' group can take care of them. Secondly, on what do 
the examination and permit-issuing agencies base their decision 
whether or not a peasant is a haphazard rural migrant, thus 
granting or denying him a work permit as the case may be? You 
say a particular peasant is a thoughtless rural migrant. The 
peasant would say otherwise. Mind you, more than anybody else 
the peasant does not want to be a rural migrant willy-nilly 
because he is solely responsible for the consequences of such 
thoughtlessness. Besides, entering the labor market is 
inherently haphazard to a certain extent. There is no market 
economy without some measure of haphazardness. The market is 
haphazard in that it is risky. The vitality of the market 
mechanism is intrinsically linked to this haphazardness. 
Haphazardness implies exploration and innovation. The way to 
avoid any haphazardness is to have the government place you in a 
job. Since that is not an option, the only thing the peasant can 
do is to strike out on his own, not without a degree of 
haphazardness, to look for or create a new job opportunity. We 
can see that if we proceed to regulate rural migration in 
accordance with the work permit mentality, the right to enter 
the labor market will be at the mercy of the subjective 
assumptions of some government personnel, and the labor market 
will be malformed. The very act of peasants leaving their 
villages in search of work crates a labor market in itself. The 
labor market spontaneously created by peasants is the most 
dynamic and extensive labor market in China these days. 
Nationwide between 50 and 60 million rural migrants have found 
work today, in an overwhelming majority of cases thanks to the 
market created and opened up by the peasants themselves. China 
has so many peasants that there is little hope the government 
can solve the unemployment problem through planned allocation. 
This innovation on the part of peasants is a historic 
contribution. Needless to say, there is indeed an oversupply of 
labor in some areas, leading to certain economic and social 
contradictions. Be that as it may, we should not attempt to 
solve problems encountered in the development of the market 
economy by resorting to traditional managerial methods. In a 
market economy, the worker is master of his own labor. In 
realizing its use value through market exchange, the worker 
should only submit to the test and selection of the market, not 
that of a government agency. Mandatory prior selection by a 
government agency is actually a kind of selection that is 
baseless, or, shall we say, a kind of selection based on the 
wishes of government officials. To use administrative methods to 
decide outright who can enter the labor market and who cannot 
based on the wishes of government officials effectively deprives 
some workers of their right to enter the market. The resultant 
labor market is an unjust market, not conducive to bona fide 
market competition. The work-permit system would only succeed in 
preventing the formation of a unified open labor market and 
perhaps leads to corruption by government agencies. 
  To solve the labor oversupply problem in some areas, the 
government should focus on developing and nurturing a market 
information system that will provide peasants with information 
services. First of all, where an individual worker goes is a 
macroeconomic decision on the labor market. The question can and 
should be answered by nobody but the worker himself. Only the 
worker is in a position to answer the question properly. This is 
because the worker knows his conditions and aspirations best and 
it is he himself who must ultimately assume responsibility for 
his decision and bear the full cost of any thoughtlessness on 
his part. He has the most interest in securing the best 
employment opportunity with the least cost. More than anybody 
else, therefore, he is a cautious decisionmaker. Second, 
regionally speaking the labor supply-demand situation is a 
macroeconomic issue on the labor market. Workers themselves are 
powerless to influence the situation. Even more important is 
government participation. The market system is huge, intricate, 
and ever-changing. Individual decision-making must be based on a 
certain amount of information. It is precisely government's role 
in a market economy to do the things that the market cannot or 
cannot do well. Now the foremost thing that rural migrants 
cannot do or cannot do well is information. Clearly it would be 
putting the cart before the horse if the government does not do 
what the workers themselves cannot do or cannot do well while 
getting involved in things the workers can do or can do well. 
Instead of doing information work, the government goes into the 
business of examination and approval and permit-issuing 
ostensibly to reduce haphazardness but actually making the 
haphazardness worse. Faced with the critical and practical issue 
of the inter-regional migration of rural workers, therefore, 
what the government should do is to provide information 
services. Specifically, this means the government capitalizing 
on its ability to regulate and control the entire economy, 
utilizing the modern mass media, and using comprehensive 
government and nongovernment organizations, even organizing 
special social forces, to monitor market movements, analyze 
market trends, and supply market information, thus providing 
favorable circumstances for decision-making by workers. Armed 
with more timely information, workers can make decisions on 
their own and worker migration will naturally become less 
haphazard. Note that government information work cannot be 
interpreted simplistically to mean the market disseminating 
information through government or peasants obtaining market 
information from government. Market activities per se are 
information activities. The market is disseminating information 
even as it operates. What the government should do is to create 
the conditions for the highly effective dissemination of market 
information, on the one hand, and directly gather and 
disseminate market information, on the other.

  Rural migration has directly led to three major social 
problems: overburdening the railway system, losing control on 
family planning, and rising crime. Certainly we need to face up 
to these problems, but they must not become the rationale for 
resorting to administrative tools to limit rural migration. 
  To ease the burden on the railroad system, we need to expand 
the system's carrying capacity to meet the transportation needs 
of a growing economy as a whole, not just rural migration. In 
the short haul, transport capacity will continue to fall behind 
the demand for transportation, so we need to impose suitable 
restrictions to relieve the pressure on the railroads. But such 
restrictions must be comprehensive instead of targeting the 
peasants alone. Everybody is free to use the huge transportation 
system... tourists, people who travel on business or to attend 
meetings. Only peasants on the move in search of a livelihood 
are barred. This does not make sense. Every time the economy 
picks up steam, the bottleneck effects of the railroads become 
more pronounced. But people do not point their fingers at an 
excess of cargo. Yet every time the number of peasants riding 
trains increases and the volume of passenger traffic exceeds the 
capacity, peasants get the blame. This too is unjustifiable. 
Rural migration has complicated population control. What we 
should do is to look into ways of improving family planning work 
even more closely, including reforming the present population 
control policy in conjunction with the reform of the permanent 
residency registration system. The idea is to make things 
convenient for peasants as well as controlling population 
growth. As part of its pregnancy testing program, a local family 
planning department insisted that an elderly woman in her 70's 
travel hundreds of li to bring home her daughter-in-law, who was 
working out of town. Furthermore, the locality publicized this 
incident as something worthy of emulation. This is blatant 
peasant harassment. Why couldn't they have been more flexible? 
Solving this string of problems involves an important 
ideological issue: Should rural migration be made to suit the 
management systems and work methods of yesteryear? Or should we 
reform the latter to accommodate the new reality of rural 
migration? The same principle applies to law and order. 
  Rural migration is inherent in the development of a market 
economy. Migration leads to disorder on certain fronts, which we 
may consider the social cost of reform. The leading candidate 
for reform is not the peasantry, but the government management 
system. This too is part of government reform.

  [Text] The results of a survey undertaken by an 
organization in Shanghai reveals that "at a loss about or 
stymied by life" "reversals and attacks," "having a crush on 
someone" and such psychological problems are among the problems 
besetting middle schoolers on the mainland. According to an 
analysis of some 1,200 letters received by a Shanghai city youth 
problem hotline from young people in 27 provinces, 
municipalities and autonomous regions, there are 14 types of 
psychological problems besetting China's middle school students. 
The report issued by the hotline divided the problems into the 
14 types shown in the adjoining chart. According to the 
analysis, of the problems listed, the most prominent were "new 
life complications" "at a loss about or stymied by life" and 
"reversals and attacks." A second year middle school male 
student (the equivalent of our fifth year middle school) said in 
his letter: "I have heard that people with money are happy; that 
people with learning are in dire straits, that the children of 
high officials use their connections and go by the back door, 
that the gifts from civilians can make an official rich... Is 
this all true? Hearing other people talk about this being 
inevitable in society, that we are the naive ones, how is one to 
adjust to this society?" If one says that the mainland middle 
schoolers' problems like being "stymied by life" are primarily 
the effect of society, then the cause of problems like 
"reversals and attacks" and "having a crush on someone" 
obviously is that the majority of them are middle school 
students are single-child homes, who are normally 
over-protected, have experienced few difficulties and who are 
psychologically ill equipped to withstand or endure any 
hardship. A Miss Wang who states that her study record has 
been consistently excellent, after failing a small exam wrote in 
her letter: "God is treating me so unfairly! My failure is 
wholly unbearable!" For the same reason another student wrote: 
"I am a piece of garbage! What are other people going to think 
of me? The stench of my rotten name has wafted afar." The thing 
that worries the concerned experts is the problem of "early 
love" among middle school students -- which everyone had always 
kept close watch over -- has recently begun to appear again as 
"having a crush on someone" and including secret heterosexual 
affairs with older people such as the parent of a classmate, a 
teacher, a famous singer, or some master of ceremonies, etc. It 
is a symptom of increasing personal and psychological immaturity.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  The thermal stress relaxation of PSZ-Mo functionally 
gradient 
material (FGM) during fabrication is optimally designed. The 
thermal stress distribution induced during the fabrication of a 
two-layer laminated PSZ-Mo material (a non-FGM or NFGM) is 
analyzed by the finite element method (FEM). The distribution 
and relaxation pattern of thermal stress in the PSZ-Mo system 
FGM during fabrication are also analyzed. The relationship 
between the thermal stress and the composition distribution 
exponent P for PSZ-Mo FGM during fabrication is 
obtained. The optimum thermal relaxation P value for 
the material system in this investigation is determined by 
thermal stress analysis. In this investigation, the FGM 
fabrication technique is also studied. FGM specimens with the 
dimensions of 24mm x 5.6mm (diameter x thickness) and 30mm x 
5mm, respectively, are successfully fabricated by a powder 
metallurgy method. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  A study of functionally gradient materials (FGMs) with 
thermal relaxation property is conducted to meet future 
high-tech demands such as for space materials. The FGMs to be 
developed are the high-quality insulation and heat-resistant 
materials with continuous variations of composition, structure, 
and properties.[.sup]1[/] 
  This investigation measures the property parameters of the 
PSZ-Mo system FGM in different compositions. Based on these 
measured data, the distribution and relaxation rules of 
diametrical stress _s_[.sub]rr[/], circumferential stress 
_s_[.sub]_th__th_[/], and axial stress _s_[.sub]zz[/] for a 

circular specimen are analyzed; the relationship between the 
thermal stress magnitude of the PSZ-Mo system FGM and the 
composition distribution index P is disclosed; and 
the best P value for thermal stress relaxation is 
determined through thermal stress analysis of the system under 
study. The FEM is used to analyze the _s_[.sub]rr[/], 
_s_[.sub]_th__th_[/], and _s_[.sub]zz[/] distributions of a 

two-layer laminated PSZ-Mo material during processing. 
Additionally, based on the analytical results, FGM fabrication 
techniques are researched, and FGM specimens free from 
macro-defects are produced. 
<H5>  2. Thermal Stress Relaxation Design, Optimum Composition </H5>
Distribution Design of PSZ-Mo System FGM 
  The raw materials used for the experiment are as follows: 
ZrO[.sub]2[/] with an average particle size of 0.5 m and a 
purity of 99.9 percent; Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], 0.03 m 
and 99.99 percent; Mo, 3 m and 99.90 percent. The test 
specimens of the six compositions are made according to the 
following procedure: pressed with cold isostatic pressure of 200 
MPa, sintered at 1500C for 2 hours under a vacuum of 1 x 
10[.sup]-3[/] Pa. The specimens are polished for property 
parameter measurement. The elastic moduli and bending stresses 
are measured by the three-point bending test with a MTS-810 
material tester (the averaged value of five specimens is adopted 
for the analysis). The thermal expansion coefficient is measured 
with a PZ-2 quartz expansometer (the averaged value of three 
specimens is adopted). Table 1 displays the property parameter 
test data. It shows that there is a quasi-linear relationship 
between the thermal expansion coefficient _a_ and the specimen 
volume fraction. However, the relationship of either Young's 
modulus E or bending strength _s_[.sub]b[/] with the specimen 
composite volume fraction does not follow a simple linear rule, 
as both are affected by the microstructure of the sintered 
material.

  One quarter of the circular test specimen is analyzed with 
the FEM. The test specimen is designed to contain 15 layers. The 
aforementioned test values are used as the parameters for 
thermal stress analysis. The properties of the specimen 
compositions other than those of the 15 layers are determined by 
Lagrangian interpolation. For FEM analysis, one-quarter specimen 
from the two-layer laminated PSZ/Mo material is divided into 960 
elements; and one-quarter specimen of FGM is divided into 1,400 
elements. In the calculation, it is assumed that during cooling 
from 1500C to 25C, the specimen deformation is 
elastic, not plastic.

    Figures 1a and 1b show the stress distributions on both 
sides 
of the two-layer boundary. Figure 1a shows that 
_s_[.sub]rr[/] is compressive on the metal side, and tensile 
on the ceramic side. The maximum stress concentration is located 
close to either side of the boundary surface. The stress 
gradually decreases away from the boundary surface. This 
phenomenon is caused by the fact that in the PSZ-Mo system 
selected for this study the thermal expansion coefficient of Mo 
is smaller than that of PSZ. Hence, at high temperature, the 
expansion magnitude of PSZ is larger than that of the metal. 
Consequently, near the boundary, the metal side endures 
compression, and the ceramic side endures tension. But in the 
locations farther away from the boundary, the metal endures 
tension, and the ceramic, compression. This pattern of 
_s_[.sub]rr[/] stress distribution causes warping of the 
specimen toward the ceramic side. Figure 1b shows the pattern of 
_s_[.sub]zz[/] distribution: tension on the metal side, and 
compression on the ceramic side. The maximum stresses also 
concentrate in areas close to both sides of the boundary 
surface. This stress mode tends to cause fracture along the 
boundary between the layers. The conclusions are that the 
deformation of PSZ-Mo two-layer laminated material after 
sintering will cause warping toward the ceramic side, and the 
separation of layers along the boundary surfaces are identical 
with the deformation observed in the prepared specimens. The 
aforementioned also describes the deformation of the Mo and PSZ 
layered specimen made by cold iso-static pressing and then 
sintered at 1500C for 2 hours under 1 x 10[.sup]-3[/] Pa 
vacuum. 
<H5>  2.2 Thermal Stress Analysis of the PSZ-Mo System FGM </H5>
  The PSZ-Mo system FGM contains 15 layers, whose compositions 
vary continuously from the metallic to the ceramic. The 
composition distribution curves are based on the equation _P_ 
= 
(x/d)[.sup]P[/],[.sup]2[/] where _P_ is the PSZ 
volume fraction; d, the specimen thickness; x, the position of a 
certain PSZ composition; and P, PSZ composition 
distribution pattern index. Figure 2 shows the distribution 
curves. The composition distribution pattern indices, 
P = 0.6, 1.0, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.2, are selected 
for the design and calculation of thermal stress relaxation and 
improvement. Figure 3 shows the results. It shows that within 
the range P = 0.6 to 2.2, the maximum stress of any 
one composition distribution is smaller than the maximum stress 
of the two-layer laminated material, which means that 
composition gradient obviously relaxes the material's internal 
thermal stress and the stress induced during fabrication. 
Besides, at the initial stage, the _s_[.sub]rr[/] and 
_s_[.sub]zz[/] (the distribution and the magnitude of 
_s_[.sub]_th__th_[/] and _s_[.sub]rr[/] are approximately 
the same) decrease with increase in P, and reach 
their minimum values when P = 1.6. After this point, 
the stresses increase with increase in the P value. 
The data show that for the PSZ-Mo system FGM, there exists an 
optimum P value, i.e. 1.6, which induces the least 
thermal stress with the largest range for thermal stress 
relaxation. Compared with the two-layer laminated material, the 
_s_[.sub]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]zz[/] decrease by 32 percent 
and 76 percent, respectively. This demonstrates that the 
gradient composition of a material obviously relaxes the thermal 
stress induced during fabrication. Especially, the wide 
_s_[.sub]zz[/] relaxation range greatly reduces the 
delamination tendency along the Z-axis. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-02B>           Figure 2. Distribution Curves of Composition </FIG>




<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-03A>             Figure 3. _s_[.sub]rr[/] and_s_[.sub]zz[/] as a Function of P </FIG>


    Figures 4a and 4b show respectively the iso-stress profiles 
of _s_[.sub]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]zz[/] of the gradient 
material, calculated by the FEM when P = 1.6. The 
iso-stress profiles disclose that the maximum stresses of 
_s_[.sub]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]zz[/] do not occur at the 
metal-ceramic boundary, but distribute within certain different 
composition zones. This illustrates that the composition 
gradient eliminates fractures due to maximum boundary stresses. 
Furthermore, comparing Figures 1a and 1b with 4a and 4b, we can 
see that the maximum tensile stress of _s_[.sub]rr[/] drops 
from +278 MPa to +189 MPa, the maximum tensile stress of 
_s_[.sub]zz[/] drops from +180 MPa to +42.6 MPa, and the 
maximum compression stress on the ceramic side rises from -136 
MPa to -170 MPa. As far as ceramic materials are concerned, the 
decrease of tensile stress and the increase of compressive 
stress are beneficial. To sum up, the composition gradient of a 
material not only relaxes the material from internal thermal 
stress, but also changes its internal stress distribution, thus 
greatly improving the material.

<H5>  3. Fabrication of PSZ-Mo System FGM </H5>
  Fifteen PSZ-Mo powder mixes of different compositions are 
prepared. Based on the aforementioned optimal design for thermal 
stress relaxation and improvement, P = 1.6 is 
selected. According to the equation _P_ = 
(x/d)[.sup]P[/], the corresponding filling 
thickness of each composition is determined. Figure 5 shows the 
graph of composition distribution versus layer thickness. The 
specimen is first filled layer by layer with powders of 
different compositions. Then it is cold iso-static pressed under 
a pressure of 200 MPa, and subsequently sintered at 1500C 
for 2 hours in a 10[.sup]-3[/] Pa vacuum. A FGM specimen with 
dimensions of 24mm x 5.6mm (diameter x thickness) and free of 
macro-defects is made. Figure 6 shows the electron microprobe 
spectra of the specimen cross section from the metal side to the 
ceramic side. It shows the continuous composition change from 
the metal side to the ceramic side: the Mo content gradually 
decreases as the Zr content gradually increases. In addition, 
another PSZ-Mo system FGM specimen with dimensions of 30mm x 5mm 
without macro-defects is made by a hot-pressing process with a 
pressure of 30 MPa at 1700C for 3 hours, followed with 
pressure release at 1200C. Figure 7 [photographs not 
reproduced] shows specimens made by hot pressing and vacuum 
sintering, respectively.

<H5>  4. Conclusions </H5>
  (1) The composition gradient of the PSZ-Mo system material 
relaxes the thermal stress induced during fabrication, and when 
P = 1.6, the most obvious relaxation occurs. 
  (2) Based on the optimal design results of thermal stress

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  Microfine PLZT (La/Zr/Ti = 9/65/35) powder is synthesized by 
sol-gel method from metal isopropylates as raw materials. The 
effects of technical parameters such as the pH values, solvents, 
and drying processes on gelling time and gel properties are 
studied. The transition process from gel to PLZT powder is 
investigated with XRD and TG-DTA [thermogravimetry/differential 
thermal analysis]. The effects of gel structure and roasting 
temperature on the properties of PLZT powder are also examined 
with XRD and TG-DTA. Experiments show that the gel forms PLZT 
solid solution at 520C and that when roasted at 550C, 
the gel produces PLZT powder with particle diameter smaller than 
0.2 m. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The ceramic (Pb, La)(Zr, Ti)O[.sub]3[/] (PLZT) has good 
electro-optic properties. Especially, PLZT thin film has great 
application potential in optoelectronic devices such as 
photo-sensitive valves, electro-optic displays, etc. Recently, 
other countries have researched various synthesizing methods to 
make PLZT ceramic powders, among which are the solid state 
method,[.sup]1[/] the co-precipitation method,[.sup]2[/] 
the alkoxide hydrolysis method,[.sup]3-5[/] etc. This 
investigation adopts a sol-gel method. The different raw 
materials of proper compositions in solution state are first 
mixed; thus, the mixing proceeds among the molecules. The final 
powder product made from the solution has superior properties 
such as very fine particle size, precise chemical composition, 
good uniformity, high reactivity, and low synthetic temperature. 
The future of the sol-gel process is appealing. 
  Fine powder with the composition of (Pb[.sub]0.91[/], 
La[.sub]0.09[/])(Zr[.sub]0.65[/], 
Ti[.sub]0.35[/])O[.sub]3[/], or PLZT (La/Zr/Ti = 9/65/35) 
is prepared by the sol-gel method with metal isopropylates as 
raw materials. The effect of gelation process on gel properties, 
as well as the effect of gel quality and roasting temperature on 
powder particle size and properties are studied. Some useful 
results are obtained. 
<H5>  2. Experimental Work </H5>
<H5>  2.1 Preparation of Raw Materials </H5>
  (Note: All the experimental chemical agents are either 
analytically pure or chemically pure.) 
  Preparation of Zirconium Isopropylate and Titanium 
Isopropylate: Zirconium isopropylate and titanium isopropylate 
are prepared by the following equations: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-04A>           Equation </FIG>


  Preparation of Lead Isopropylate: Pure dehydrated lead 
acetate is prepared by heating trihydrate lead acetate at 
80C-90C for 8 hours. Sodium isopropylate is prepared 
through the refluxed reaction between a proper amount of 
metallic sodium and isopropyl alcohol at 40C to 50C 
for 1 hour. After that, lead acetate and a proper amount of 
benzene are added into the bath. The refluxed reaction is 
continued for another 2 hours. Finally, lead isopropylate is 
obtained by filtering the solution and removing the benzene at a 
reduced pressure. The reaction is shown as follows: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-04B>           Equation </FIG>

  Preparation of Lanthanum Isopropylate: First, 
LaCl[.sub]3[/] is prepared from the reaction between 
La[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and NH[.sub]4[/]Cl; then the 
reaction of LaCl[.sub]3[/] with sodium isopropylate produces 
La(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]3[/] according to 
the following equation: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-05A>           Equation </FIG>

<H5>  2.2 Preparation of Gel and PLZT </H5>
  According to the molar ratio, specific amounts of 
Pb(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]2[/] and 
La(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]3[/] are loaded in a 
three-port flask. A proper amount of isopropyl alcohol is then 
added into the flask and the reaction is refluxed for 1 hour. 
Then, the isopropyl alcohol solutions of 
Ti(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]4[/] and 
Zr(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]4[/] are 
successively and gradually added, and the reaction is refluxed 
for another hour before a proper amount of water is added to the 
solution. The specific pH value of the solution is adjusted with 
HAc and NH[.sub]4[/]OH. The refluxing goes on until the 
solution turns into sol, which is transferred to a plastic 
container. The assembly is transferred to a clean location. At 
room temperature the sol turns into wet gel, then the wet gel is 
dried into dry gel under certain conditions. 
  The dry gel is loaded in a muffle furnace. After the furnace 
temperature is raised to 550C at a prescribed heating rate, 
and maintained at 550C for 2 hours, the dry gel decomposes 
into PLZT microfine powder. 
<H5>  2.3 Property Evaluation </H5>
  The gel apparent density and gel porosity are measured by 
the 
ethanol soaking method. The DTA and TG curves of the gel are 
measured with a PCT-1 differential thermal balance (made by 
Beijing Optical Instrument Plant). The specific surface area of 
PLZT powder is measured by the BET low temperature nitrogen 
adsorption method. The X-ray spectrum of the powder is 
determined with a Rigaku D/max-rB X-ray spectrometer made in 
Japan. The powder surface configuration is observed with a Type 
S-250Mkj scanning electron microscope (SEM). The powder particle 
diameters (D[.sub]50[/] and D[.sub]v[/]) and their 
distributions are measured with a BI-90 laser scattering 
particle analyzer made in the United States. 
<H5>  3. Results and Discussions </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Effect of pH Value on Gelling Time and Gel Structure </H5>
  The sol-gel process of metal isopropylates is generally 
believed to be a two-step reaction process, the hydrolysis and 
the polycondensation of the metal isopropylates. The speed and 
the degree of completion of both reactions are determined by 
factors such as pH values, catalysts, etc. 
  Measurement of gelling time: The gelling time is measured 
from the time when the sol reaches room temperature to the time 
when the gel solidifies to such a condition that its surface 
does not move while the container is tilted to 
45.[.sup]6[/] 
  Figure 1 shows the effect of pH value (from 2 to 9) on 
gelling time. It shows that the longest gelling time occurs when 
the pH value is between 6 and 7. When the pH value is greater 
than 7 the gelling speed increases rapidly. When the pH value is 
less than 5, the change of gelling speed is not apparent. It is 
easier to control the gelling speed by adding acidic solution. 
Besides, acidic solution also produces uniform transparent gel. 
It is difficult to control the gelling speed with a basic 
solution, which also makes the gel less transparent. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-05B>           Figure 1. Effect of pH Value on the Gelation Time </FIG>

  The pH value of the solvent also clearly affects the gel 
structure as shown in Figure 2. When the pH value is low, the 
gel apparent density and gel porosity change only slightly with 
change in pH value. When the pH value is greater than 6, with 
increase in the pH value, the apparent density (Curve 1) rapidly 
decreases and the porosity rapidly increases (Curve 2). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-06A>           Figure 2. Effect of pH Value on the Apparent Density and Porosity of the Gel </FIG>

  The aforementioned results show that the catalytic effects 
of 
acid or base on the sol-gel process are quite different. Further 
study on the catalytic mechanism is needed. 
<H5>  3.2 Effect of Solvent on Gel Structure </H5>
  Figure 3 displays the apparent densities of gels made with 
different monohydric alcohols as solvents. It shows that when 
straight-chain monohydric alcohol is used, the dry gel apparent 
density increases with the increase of solvent surface tension. 
During gel drying, the capillary force controls the gel frame 
contraction. And the capillary force is in direct proportion 
with the surface tension of the solvent. Therefore, lower 
surface tension will produce lower contraction pressure, which 
is favorable to the forming of larger voids, resulting in lower 
apparent density. On the contrary, higher surface tension 
produces a gel with higher apparent density. However, this is 
not the case when isopropanol alcohol is used as solvent. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-06B>           Figure 3. Relationship Between Apparent Density of Gel and Surface Tension of Solvents Used </FIG>

  Isopropanol alcohol has the lowest surface tension (21.7 x 
10[.sup]-3[/] N-m[.sup]-1[/]) but the dry gel produced by 
it does not have the lowest apparent density. This phenomenon 
indicates that the effect of solvent on gel structure is not 
simply reflected in gel apparent density. The apparent density 
is also affected by other solvent molecular properties. 
<H5>  3.3 Effect of Drying Condition on Gel Properties and the </H5>
PLZT Powder Particle Size 
  The gel samples made from the isopropanol alcohol as solvent 
with pH = 4 are dried separately under the following three 
conditions: 
  (1) dry the sample in an oven at 100C for 8 hours at a 
stretch repeatedly until there is no weight change of the gel 
sample; 
  (2) dry the sample in an oven at 50C for 12 hours at a 
stretch repeatedly until there is no weight change of the gel 
sample. After that, the oven temperature is raised to 100C, 
and then the gel is dried again according to process (1); 
  (3) dry the sample in vacuum at room temperature for 12 
hours 
at a stretch repeatedly until there is no weight change of the 
gel sample. After that, the gel sample is dried according to 
process (1). 
  Table 1 shows the qualities and apparent densities of the 
gels dried by the three different methods. It indicates that 
drying conditions greatly affect gel quality. The higher the 
temperature, the higher the drying speed, and the more inferior 
is the gel quality. During high-temperature speed-drying, the 
uneven stress from volume contraction of the gel surface and the 
gel interior causes gel cracking. At high temperature, the 
surface tension of the solvent becomes smaller and produces 
larger void volume. Consequently, the gel transparency worsens 
and the gel apparent density is reduced.

  Each of the gels made by the three different drying methods 
is roasted at 550C for 2 hours to produce PLZT powder. 
Figure 4 displays the powder particle size cumulative frequency 
distribution curves. It shows that the PLZT powder made from 
gels dried in the 100C oven has the widest range of 
particle size distribution and the largest grain size, with 345 
nm as the median particle diameter D[.sub]50[/] (i.e., the 
equivalent diameter at 50 percent cumulative frequency). The 
PLZT powder made from room-temperature vacuum drying has a 
narrow range of particle diameter distribution and the smallest 
grain size, with 126 nm as D[.sub]50[/]. High-temperature 
rapid-drying increases the agglomeration tendency of gel 
particles, and hence produces PLZT powder with large 
conglomerations. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-07A>           Figure 4. Particle Size Distribution Curves </FIG>


<H5>  3.4 Thermal Analysis of Dry Gel </H5>
  The gel dried in the 50C oven is analyzed by TG and 
DTA. 
Figure 5 shows the TG and DTA curves. The TG curve indicates 
that the gel decomposition is completed at 500C because no 
weight loss occurs after this temperature. In the DTA curve, the 
endothermic peak around 140C is caused by the evaporation 
of water and isopropanol; the exothermic peak around 350C, 
by the burning of the organic material; and the exothermic peak 
around 520C, by the formation of the PLZT solid solution. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-07B>           Figure 5. DTA and TG Curves of Gel </FIG>


<H5>  3.5 Effect of Roasting Temperature on PLZT Powder Properties </H5>
  Based on the DTA results, the dry gel samples are divided 
into batches. Each sample batch is roasted for 2 hours within 
the temperature range 450C to 700C at an increment of 
50C or 100C. The X-ray diffraction analysis results of 
the samples after roasting are shown in Figure 6. The curves in 
Figure 6 shows that the PLZT powder from the 450C roasted 
sample has amorphous structure. A small amount of crystals 
appears in the powder from the 500C roasted sample. The 
powder from the 550C roasted sample completely crystallizes 
into a single PLZT crystal phase. The powders from samples 
roasted between 600C and 700C show no new phases but 
stronger and sharper diffraction peaks. This indicates that in 
the 600C to 700C range, the crystal particle size of 
samples increases with the increase of roasting temperature, but 
the crystal phase remains unchanged. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-07C>           Figure 6. XRD for PLZT Powder Calcined at Different Temperatures </FIG>

  Table 2 shows the median diameters D[.sub]50[/], average 
volume diameters D[.sub]v[/], and the specific surface areas 
of powders roasted at 550C, 600C, and 700C, 
respectively. Figure 7 [photographs not reproduced] shows the 
SEM photographs of the powders. Table 2 and Figure 7 indicate 
that the particle of PLZT powder grows with increase in roasting 
temperature -- a result identical with those of the X-ray 
diffraction. These test results conclude that low-temperature 
roasting is favorable to the production of microfine PLZT 
powder. However, at PLZT solid solution does not form at too low 
a roasting temperature; hence, the optimum roasting temperature 
range is 550-600C.

<H5>  4. Conclusions </H5>
  (1) The optimum parameters for producing PLZT microfine 
powder with metal isopropylates as raw materials are: isopropyl 
alcohol as solvent, acetic acid as catalyst, pH = 3-4, 
low-temperature and low-speed drying, and roasting temperature 
within the range of 550-600C. 
  (2) Under basic condition, gel particles tend to 
agglomerate, 
and produce large-diameter PLZT particles. 
  (3) To produce PLZT microfine powder, the gel drying process 
and the gel roasting temperature must be closely controlled.

Breaking for Smart Tower at Shentong Square''] 
  [Summary] With the approval of the State Education 
Commission, Shanghai Jiaotong University recently leased a 10-mu 
plot of land in the Golden Section of the Huai-Hai West Road for 
foreign-investment-oriented development projects. A few days 
ago, Shanghai Shentong [3947 6639] International S&amp;T 
Company--formed from the Shanghai Municipal Land Management 
Bureau and Shanghai Jiaotong University's Overseas 
Company--reached agreement with Hong Kong's Huaxu [5478 2485] 
Ltd. to build on this plot a US$70 million trans-century smart 
tower. Groundbreaking for this smart tower, to be called 
Shentong Square, took place yesterday. The joint venture, 
called Shanghai Shentong Real Estate Development Ltd., hoisted 
its signpost yesterday as it geared up for this development 
project. The 28-floor Shentong Square, occupying 60,000 square 
meters of land, is to be completed in 1996, in honor of the 
centennial of the university. The tower offices will be 
partially sold and partially leased.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NEC Plans Software Venture in </F>
Beijing"] 
  [Text] Tokyo (Agencies via XINHUA) -- NEC Corp announced 
last week that it had reached an agreement to set up a computer 
software development venture in Beijing next month with the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences. The NEC-CAS Software Laboratories 
Ltd. will be capitalized at 150 million yen ($1.5 million), with 
NEC holding 90 percent and the Institute of Software of the 
Academia Sinica holding the remaining 10 percent. 
  NEC said the venture would start operating in July with 50 
employees, rising to 200 at a later stage. Software sales are 
targeted to climb from 60 million yen ($576,000) in the first 
year to 200 million yen ($1.92 million) by 1999. The new 
company, said to be the first software development venture in 
China, will focus on developing open-system UNIX-based 
middleware and computer-aided software engineering products for 
the Chinese market. 
  Due to the progressive development of downsizing and open 
systems in recent years, the demand for portable computers and 
workstations in China has expanded rapidly, NEC said. "There is 
a high expectation of rapid growth in the personal computer and 
workstation markets due to rapid growth in Chinese industry," it 
added.

<F P=106> [Article by Song Ning: ``GEIS Teams Up to Explore Data </F>
Networks''] 
  [Text] General Electric Information Services (GEIS) entered 
[into] a partnership agreement yesterday with the Great Wall 
Computer Group, marking a major step by the US company in 
joining the Three Golden Projects, China's colossal information 
network. GEIS, one of 12 subsidiaries of the General Electric 
Company, authorized the Great Wall to become its sales arm in 
China. The Beijing-based company, one of the largest computer 
makers in China, had been service agent for the American firm's 
China-based clients. 
  GEIS is one of the largest global suppliers of electronic 
mail (E-mail) and electronic data interchange (EDI). It has 15 
users based in China, including China National Chemicals Import 
and Export Corporation (Sinochem) and China Ocean Shipping 
Corporation (COSCO). ``By developing our cooperation with the 
Great Wall, our products can be fully adapted to local 
requirements,'' said Owen Chan, managing director of GEIS 
operations in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
  The Three Golden Projects will link China's banking and 
customs services and national information interchange through 
huge information networks. Although the project has yet to 
begin, foreign companies have been lobbying hard to get 
contracts. 
  Many of the projects are attracting overseas investors 
despite the heavy input they require. Hellene S. Runtagh, 
president of GEIS, said: ``Having an impressive local partner 
like the Great Wall will help us come to meet the Chinese 
requirements for the information highway. Competition will be 
less with such a partnership.'' She said her company hopes to 
win bids in the Golden Customs and Golden Card Projects since 
GEIS has more than 20 years of experience in handling EDI 
trading and credit card services. 
  GEIS has a joint venture in the United States with 
Ameritech, 
which has long been in the credit card sector. Quentin P. 
Gallivan, vice-president of GEIS, said he is interested in 
technology transfer with Chinese partners. ``We want to have 
the technology operating in the US brought to China and work 
with companies like the Great Wall to meet Chinese needs,'' he 
said. ``We're not only concerned with giving EDI software, we 
want to teach the Chinese how to set up an EDI service and how 
to make it successful.''

<F P=106> [Article by Gao Tao: ``Information Sector Thrives''] </F>
  [Text] China's booming telecommunications industry is 
rapidly developing a modern nationwide information network. The 
immediate task is focusing on expanding and upgrading the 
[Chinapac] packet-switched public data network to meet the 
growing demands for non-voice telecommunications across the 
country and with the world, said an official from the Ministry 
of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT). 
  The network includes two levels--the backbone network 
(primary switching centres) and regional networks in each 
province, autonomous region and municipality (secondary 
switching centres). The trunk network, containing 5,500 ports, 
has been finished and put into operation. The network includes 
696 trunk ports, two international gateways, and one gateway for 
Hong Kong and Macao. Data transmission is realized through the 
public telecommunications system, including fibre-optic cables, 
microwave and satellite communications. Through the network, 
computer owners across the country who join Chinapac can 
exchange information and contact with other computer users at 
home and abroad. 
  By the end of this year, the network will cover 500 Chinese 
cities as local telecommunications administrations are building 
14 provincial networks. Another 15 provincial networks have 
already been established. It is expected that the network will 
cover all counties in East, South and Central China and some 
counties in West China by 1995. MPT expects that the number of 
users of the network will reach 8,000 this year and grow to 
20,000 by 1995. At present, most of the users are financial 
organizations, banks, stock exchanges, large enterprises and 
government departments. The official stressed that it is 
important to constantly upgrade the network's technology and 
facilities to meet the growing demands of the customers. It is 
the trend and the plan of the ministry to link up all databases 
in the country through the network, making it possible for all 
to share the information. Methods of dividing the profits 
between databases and telecommunications departments will be 
worked out. 
  The non-voice telecommunications service sector, otherwise 
called value-added service communications, is expected to grow 
by 50 percent this year and the next. Beyond the next couple of 
years, services are charted to grow at an annual rate of 30 
percent between 1996 and 2000. With the further upgrading and 
expansion of China's public telecommunications network, more and 
more data communications will become possible, such as videotex, 
E-mail, EDI [Electronic Data Interchange] and other services. 
Videotex integrates data transmission and data processing and 
displays the information or image on a computer terminal. The 
service is now available in Shanghai and will be expanded to 
Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Beijing and other big cities. Most 
equipment for the service is imported from France and Germany 
while the rest is domestically made. It is expected that the 
number of videotex users will grow to 5,000 by the end of next 
year and to 30,000 by 2000. 
  The E-mail service provides computer networking that 
facilitates the transfer of text, messages, and other 
information among the subscribers. Six such systems have been 
installed in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Jiangmen, Shenzhen 
and Qingdao, and each allows 3,000 mailboxes. The average 
capacity of each mailbox is 100,000 bytes. In order to promote 
wide application of the system, research institutes in China 
have developed technical specifications and requirements for 
E-mail service. The wide application of E-mail will greatly 
increase the demand for the packet-switched public data network 
in China. 
  Electronic data interchange (EDI) is a system allowing 
traders to do business using electronic telecommunications 
rather than papers. It ensures rapid transactions and reduces 
human error. Several Chinese departments and ministries, such 
as telecommunications departments, the electronics industry, 
banks, foreign trade and customs, are jointly working to 
establish a national EDI system. It is planned that a 
nationwide EDI system will be formed by 2000 and connected with 
the international network. It is also believed that China will 
lose a competitive edge in foreign trade if the development of 
the EDI system is delayed. EDI systems have been adopted by 
many countries. Customs clearance among most European countries 
and the United States are done by using EDI. It was reported 
that 95 percent of foreign trade in Singapore is conducted 
through EDI. 
  The ministry plans to expand and link up all public 
telephone 
directory inquiry systems and information services databases 
across the country operated by themselves. The information 
services databases, the 168 access code on the public phone 
network, will be one of the main targets for development in the 
future. Whenever the customer needs information, if they just 
dial 168 they will get all they need.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Chen Xianfa [7115 0341 4099]: "Anhui Is </F>
Building an Energy Resource Base Area in China with a Total 
Investment of 4 Billion Yuan in New Mining Area"] 
  [Text] The Chinese Government has continually increased the 
intensity of investments during the past several years in 
Huainan City, Anhui Province, east China's "Energy Resource 
City," to reduce this region's energy resource shortages. 
  Huainan has always been known as a "motive power granary" of 
the east China region, China's most economically vigorous 
region. Since implementation of the "Chang Jiang Strategy" of 
developing Pudong [New Economic Zone in Shanghai] to spur an 
economic takeoff in the entire Chang Jiang river basin, this 
city's status has become even more prominent. 
  Huainan City has a superior quality coal field with the 
largest reserves -- the Huainan Mining region -- with projected 
reserves of 30 billion tons which include 10.8 billion tons of 
carefully surveyed reserves, equal to one-fourth of China's 
reserves that have the proper conditions for extraction. 
  Huainan is about 570 kilometers from Shanghai, China's 
economic center, and the railroads that run through the Huainan 
City region are connected to China's north-south artery, the 
Jin-Pu [Tianjin-Pudong] line, and are just a few 10 kilometers 
from the Jing-Jiu [Beijing-Kowloon] line now under construction. 
Some 200 kilometers to the south it goes through the Yuxikou 
Dedicated Coal Pier and enters the Chang Jiang channel. Thus, 
its regional location is superior. Calculations indicate that 
transporting coal from Huainan to Shanghai is 1,200 kilometers 
closer than hauling it from China's other coal base area, 
Shanxi, and that hauling 30 million newly-dug tons from Huainan 
to Shanghai could save 1.65 billion yuan in railroad shipping 
fees alone compared to transporting it from Shanxi. 
  Officials in Huainan City said that the city's total coal 
output during 1993 was about 12 million tons. Although by the 
end of this century the entire city's total coal output, 
including central unified distribution coal mines and local coal 
mines, will reach 27 million tons, it will still be unable to 
satisfy the huge demand for economic growth in east China. At 
that time, the Chang Jiang Delta region with Shanghai at its 
center will have coal shortages of 80 to 100 million tons. To 
alleviate the contradiction between supply and demand, Huainan 
has formulated a program to accelerate development in an effort 
to surpass 40 million tons in coal by 2010. The Chinese 
Government is providing focused support for this program and the 
State will invest 5.28 billion yuan in Huainan's unified 
distribution coal mines, including 2.04 billion yuan that will 
be completed during the next three years. Central authorities 
have already invested a total of 4 billion yuan in surveys, 
construction, and production in Huainan's new mining regions. 
  Huainan also holds status in China in power generating 
capacity. It currently has an installed generating capacity of 
2,300MW and generates 12.3 billion kWh of electricity annually.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Tang Dongning [3282 2639 1337]: "China </F>
Overcomes a Technical Problem in Power Grid Stability for the 
First Time with a Unique Leading Theory in International 
Applications"] 
  [Text] People have difficulty imagining what the outcome 
would be should there be a loss of stability in large power 
grids, which are so inseparable from our national economy and 
social life. Dr. Xue Yusheng [5641 4416 0524], chief engineer in 
the Ministry of Electric Power Industry's Nanjing Automation 
Institute, has created a completely new electric power system 
computation method, the Expanded Equal-Area Criterion (EEAC). 
After a year of on-line application in China, it has 
successfully achieved power grid transient state safety 
monitoring and control. This achievement is an indication that 
an acute technical problem that has troubled the world's 
electric power industry for a long time has been solved. 
  EEAC, called "Xue's Method" by international academic 
circles, was invented while Xue Yusheng was studying for his 
doctorate at Liege University in Belgium in 1986. At the time, 
it was internationally recognized that all representative 
electric power system transient state direct safety analysis 
methods were established on their own empirical assumptions and 
that they were very ill-adapted to the quick and accurate 
analytical computations required by extremely complex large 
power grids. Thus, for many years electric power S&amp;T circles 
in 
all countries have continuously striven to explore new routes. 
The EEAC direct method, the unique creation of a Chinese person, 
effectively simplifies the extremely complex stability problems 
of large electric power systems into an equal-value dual-machine 
system stability problem, and is the only rapid computation 
method in the world at present using a purely analytical mode to 
resolve electric power system stability. It has a high degree of 
precision and its actual applied speed is two numerical grades 
faster than the numerical integration methods of the past. In 
1991, the French Electric Power Company (EDF), the largest in 
the world, applied EEAC in its power grid system and operating 
program. Because of its obviously superior computation precision 
and speed, many countries are now tracking this achievement. 
  Because EEAC was still in the static stage at the end of 
1991, Dr. Xue Yusheng and a scientific research group led by 
him, further developed a dynamic state EEAC and developed a 
critical identification method. This raised the precision of 
EEAC up to a new stage and freed operating personnel from their 
a priori knowledge and took a major step toward its use in 
engineering. In China, the Nanjing Automation Institute has 
placed EEAC into formal on-line operation in the East China 
Grid's real-time energy management system. The results over the 
past year confirm that EEAC provides great assistance in 
avoiding power grid destabilization accidents. 
  At the EEAC examination and acceptance meeting held on 2 
April 1994, Ministry of Electric Power Industry minister Shi 
Dazhen [0670 1129 2923] called on power grids in all areas of 
China to extend and apply this internationally advanced 
stability computation method to raise safe and stable operation 
of China's power grids to a new level.

  [Text] Guiyang -- The central government has approved the 
construction of the Hongjiadu Hydropower Station on the Wujiang 
River, a major tributary of the Yangtze River, in Southwest 
China's Guizhou Province. The station will have a generating 
capacity of 540,000 kW. Experts calculate that the Wujiang River 
represents 8.56 million kW of potential hydroelectric capacity. 
A 630,000-kW hydropower station is now in operation and a 
510,000-kW plant will be completed within the year. In the long 
run, a Wujiang hydropower base with generating capacity of 6.39 
million kW is envisioned in the next 25 years.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Li Jianmin [2621 1696 3046]: "Southwest </F>
China To Build Electric Power Corridor; Preferential Policies 
Implemented To Encourage Foreign Businesses To Become Involved 
in Energy Resource Base Area Construction"] 
  [Text] By the end of this century, southwest China will 
finish building an "electric power corridor," an energy resource 
development deployment to "transmit power from west to east 
China" will have basically taken shape, and China's largest 
cluster of hydropower bases will arise in southwest China. 
  This information was revealed by representatives from the 
four provinces of southwest China attending the 2d session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress. 
  He Rong [6320 2837], a Yunnan representative to the National 
People's Congress and assistant general manager of the Chang 
Jiang Three Gorges Development Corporation, said during a visit 
by Xinhua news agency reporters that southwest China is a region 
with China's most abundant hydropower resources, with 194,000MW 
of total developable and usable hydropower, equal to 57 percent 
of China's total hydropower. For a long time, this area has 
consistently been an important base area providing energy 
resources to all of China, especially the coastal regions of 
east China. 
  Representative Wang Zhaobang [3769 0340 6721], deputy chief 
engineer in the Guangxi Hydropower Engineering Bureau, told 
reporters that construction of the southwest China energy 
resource base area will mainly be focused on cascade development 
of six large river basins in the region, the Jinsha Jiang, 
Yalong Jiang, Dadu He, Lancang Jiang, Wu Jiang, and Hongshui He, 
and that a cluster of hydropower bases is now taking shape. 
  He said that 65 large hydropower stations have been planned 
for the trunks of these rivers alone with a total installed 
generating capacity of 120,000MW. This includes 11 hydropower 
stations that have already been completed or that are now under 
construction with a total installed generating capacity of 
10,810MW and annual power output of 51.92 billion kWh. 
  These two experts revealed that seven additional large 
hydropower stations with a total installed generating capacity 
of almost 20,000MW will be built there during the Ninth 5-Year 
Plan (1996-2000). 
  He Rong said that the large-scale construction of energy 
resource base areas in southwest China is an important strategic 
step being taken by the Chinese Government to deal with the loss 
of coordination in China's national energy resource structure 
and the electric power shortages of the coastal region of east 
China. Now, the Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou power grids have 
begun transmitting power from the Tianshengqiao Second Cascade 
Power Station, recently placed into operation, to Guangdong, and 
this is an initial realization of the State's long-term idea of 
an energy resource development deployment to "transmit power 
from west to east China." 
  He said that the southwest China region will use foreign 
capital to accelerate energy resource base area construction. 
The provinces of southwest China have now formulated a series of 
preferential policies to encourage foreign businesses to come to 
southwest China for joint investments in electric power 
development or independent investments to develop electric power. 
  According to the information, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, and 
Guizhou will sign more than 10 joint investment electric power 
development projects with companies from the United States, 
Thailand, and Hong Kong. Furthermore, the four provinces and 
autonomous regions of southwest China will also bring in World 
Bank and Asian Development Bank loans of more than $1 billion. 
  The experts say they expect that with more intensive reform 
and opening up, the combination of rapid development of the 
southwest China energy resource base area and the economic 
advantages of east and west China will lead to further 
developments in a substantial direction.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Zou Qingli [6760 3237 7787]: "Decision </F>
Made on Supply Arrangements for Three Gorges Hydropower 
Generators That Combine Solicitation of Bids From Foreign 
Countries With Domestic Cooperation"] 
  [Text] I learned on 26 March 1994 from the State Council's 
Three Gorges Project Construction Commission Office that China 
will adopt an arrangement involving solicitation of bids from 
foreign countries in conjunction with the cooperation of 
domestic enterprises to design and manufacture the large power 
generators required for the Three Gorges project. 
  According to chief engineer Li Shouren [2621 1343 0088] from 
the Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, the Three Gorges 
project will require a total of 26 large mixed flow-through 
turbine generators with unit capacities of 700MW. The water 
turbine rotors will be about 9.85 meters in diameter. They will 
be among the world's largest hydropower generators in dimensions 
and will involve relatively high design and manufacturing 
technology requirements. During the past several years, China's 
machine-building industry has done many preliminary attacks on 
key technical problems and other preparatory work to develop the 
hydropower generators for the Three Gorges project, and it now 
basically has the capability of manufacturing this type of large 
hydropower generator. 
  Taking into consideration the possibility of using foreign 
investments for the Three Gorges project, to ensure that the 
technology and quality of the generators in the Three Gorges 
project attain advanced world levels and spur further 
improvement in China's power generation equipment development 
levels, the State has decided to carry out international bid 
solicitation around 1996 to develop the 26 large hydropower 
generators needed for the Three Gorges project. The first 12 
generators will utilize a supply arrangement involving joint 
design and cooperative production by the foreign businesses that 
win the bids, Harbin Generator Plant, and the East China 
Generator Plant. The foreign businesses will have overall 
responsibility in the areas of technology, quality, delivery 
schedules, and so on, to the proprietor, the China Chang Jiang 
Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, while the 
cooperating plants on the Chinese side will be responsible to 
the foreign businesses. During the process of joint design and 
cooperative production, the Chinese manufacturing plants must 
gradually increase the proportion of their responsibility and 
gain an understanding of generator design and manufacturing 
technology. The last 14 generators will mainly be produced 
domestically with the Chinese plants assuming responsibility for 
supplying the equipment to the proprietor.

Accelerating Development of Wu Jiang's Hydropower, Nine Large 
Hydropower Stations To Be Built on the Trunk of the Wu Jiang"] 
  [Text] Construction and development of southwest China's Wu 
Jiang Hydropower Energy Resource Base Area will be further 
accelerated. The State has now approved construction of the 
Hongjiadu Hydropower Station with an installed generating 
capacity of 540MW on the trunk of the Wu Jiang. 
  This is a "spigot" station on the trunk of the Wu Jiang, an 
important tributary of the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang, as 
well as the third hydropower station being built for cascade 
development of the Wu Jiang as a whole. After its completion, it 
will play an important role in increasing power output in 
downstream cascade power stations. 
  The trunk of the Wu Jiang is a big hydropower "motherlode" 
with a developable total installed generating capacity of 
8,560MW. The State has now formally approved construction of 
nine large hydropower stations on the trunk of the Wu Jiang. 
Wujiangdu Hydropower Station, with an installed generating 
capacity of 630MW, has been completed and is generating power, 
and construction of the Dongfeng Power Station with an installed 
generating capacity of 510MW will be completed in 1994 and will 
be placed into operation. China plans to complete the Wujiang 
Hydropower Energy Resource Base Area with a total installed 
generating capacity of 6,390MW and annual power output of up to 
40 billion kWh within the next 25 years. 
  The Wu Jiang river basin is one of 19 key development zones 
proposed in China's overall territorial development program. The 
largest coal mine base area south of the Chang Jiang, it has a 
full complement of coal varieties and 30.8 billion tons of 
reserves. The river basin also has abundant aluminum, 
phosphorous, manganese, mercury, and other mineral resources, 
including 207 million tons of bauxite, and comes in third place 
for resources in China. It has 2.58 million tons of phosphorous 
ore reserves, which holds second place in China, and it holds 
first place in China in superior-quality phosphorous ore 
reserves. 
  Experts feel that these resource advantages form a rather 
good group of matching configurations and give it comprehensive 
advantages for developing the high energy-consuming raw 
materials industry.

<F P=106> [Excerpts from article by Vice Minister of Coal Industry, </F>
Han Ying [7281 5391]: "On the Situation in Plan Execution in 
1993 and Plan Arrangements for 1994"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  II. Plan Arrangements for 1994 </H5>
  In 1994, State plans arrange for expected raw coal output of 
1.16 billion tons, an increase of 20 million tons over 1993. 
This includes 480 million tons at State-owned key coal mines, a 
reduction of 27 million tons; 195 million tons at State-owned 
local coal mines, basically the same as in 1993; and 485 million 
tons at township and town coal mines, an increase of 13 million 
tons. The total output plan for 1994 is a projected plan and 
does not check the total output execution situation. 
  In 1994, the total amount commodity coal resources turned 
over to the State for allocation was still 552.24 million tons. 
This includes 479.98 million tons in State orders and 72.26 
million tons in resources that were changed from State orders to 
regional orders, concentrated in northwest China, southwest 
China, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and other regions, with the 
remaining resources going through provincial orders and 
enterprises doing their own selling on the market. The problem 
reflected in coal orders in 1994 was once again that supplies of 
coal exceeded demand, and in particular there were surpluses of 
anthracite mixed pulverized coal and some varieties of dressed 
coal for smelting. 
  During the process of executing production plans in 1994, we 
must be concerned about the following problems: 1) The State 
only implements macro regulation and control and an overall 
balance. Many rights have been transferred down to 
province-level administrative departments and enterprises, and 
we must certainly do our jobs and assume our responsibilities. 
We cannot let things slide because of the emphasis on macro 
management and create a situation in which things have no one 
managing them and nothing is being managed; 2) We must certainly 
establish the concept of the market economy, solidly grasp the 
focus on economic results, arrange plans on the basis of market 
demand conditions and selling and transportation conditions, and 
organize production and administrative activities; 3) Production 
plan management arrangements and management measures have 
changed, but mining bureaus and province-level administrative 
departments must have an idea of what their mine production 
situations are, how their economic results are, and which mines 
should increase their output and which should restrict their 
output or cease production, and they should adopt active 
measures for additional guidance. Although production plans have 
not been checked, enterprise production plans and province 
(autonomous region) production plans should all be reported to 
higher authorities on schedule and according to stipulations to 
enable us to gain information and carry out industry management 
and macro regulation and control. I ask that comprehensive 
planning departments at all levels focus well on this item of 
work in accordance with this requirement. 
  In the area of technical upgrading, plan arrangements are 
for 
883 million yuan to be invested in technical upgrading in the 
coal industry during 1994, which will include 200 million yuan 
in central government financial allocations, 513 million yuan in 
bank loans, and 170 million yuan in self-raised capital for 
projects receiving bank loans. The implementation of our 
technical upgrading plans for 1994 requires that we 
conscientiously focus on work in the following items: 1) Focus 
on providing the capital. Investments in technical upgrading 
during 1994 overall involve two forms. One is composed of State 
allocations and self-raised capital. The other is composed of 
bank loans and self-raised capital. To provide these funds, we 
must do a great deal of coordination and linking work 
everywhere. Planning departments at all levels must 
conscientiously do this work well and report the situation in 
funding implementation and plan execution to the Ministry of 
Coal Industry; 2) We must focus on work to implement technical 
upgrading projects, ensure project quality and progress, and 
make technical upgrading projects produce investment benefits as 
quickly as possible. 
  In the area of capital construction, the scale of 
investments 
arranged for coal in 1994 by the central government is 15.29 
billion yuan, an increase of 20 million yuan over plans at the 
beginning of 1993. This includes 4,247,300,000 yuan in domestic 
budget investments, 8,654,700,000 yuan in construction bank 
loans, 400 million yuan in special funds, 1.381 billion yuan in 
foreign investments, 237 million yuan in investments to shift 
from oil to coal, 270 million yuan in self-raising indicators, 
and 100 million yuan in small-scale capital construction 
investments in local coal mines. The main problems in 
arrangements for investments in capital construction in the coal 
industry are: 1) Limited investments, an increase of just 20 
million yuan compared to 1993; 2) The 15.29 billion yuan in 
investments still arranges for a 400 million yuan development 
fund, but after coal prices are deregulated there will be no way 
that this money can be obtained by users outside the calculated 
prices. We have proposed to the State that it be changed into 
other categories of investments; 3) There is 3.16 billion yuan 
in capital construction bonds that will reach maturity and 
should be repaid in 1994. We have arranged to repay 210 million 
yuan in capital construction investments during the year, but 
the remaining 2.95 billion yuan (bonds and construction loan 
interest and principal) has not been dealt with. Preliminary 
arrangements have been made for a scale of capital construction 
of mines in the coal industry at 89 locations with 137.14 
million tons, including 18 mines that will be placed into 
production with 31.99 million tons, 64 mines where construction 
will continue with 93.6 million tons, seven mines where 
construction will start with 11.55 million tons, and 18 mines 
where preparations for construction will be made with 68 million 
tons. There are five mines with poor results that will cease 
construction, with 3.09 million tons. 
  After consultations with the State Council and investment 
companies, the principles for arranging for investments in the 
coal industry in 1994 are: make key arrangements for those 
projects that will have good administrative results after going 
into production, can repay loans, and have good external 
transportation conditions; make normal arrangements for those 
projects which will have relatively good results after going 
into production but which will be unable to repay the loans and 
which have external transportation conditions; straighten out 
those projects which would have poor administrative results 
after going into production, experience losses, be unable to 
repay loans, and have poor external transportation conditions, 
and cease building those where construction should be stopped. 
In addition, readjust the investment structure, increase 
investments as appropriate in railroads, power plants, cement 
plants, and other projects with benefits. In 1994, a total 
investment of 1.996 billion yuan has been arranged for cement 
plants, power plants, and railroads, an increase of 555 million 
yuan over 1993. The ratio between mines and matching facilities 
in yearly capital construction investments in the past was 
consistently 67:33, but it will reach 58:42 in 1994. There is a 
significant increase in investments in benefits projects. 
  Rather substantial changes will occur in coal investment 
channels in 1994. In particular, construction bank loans will 
account for more than half the total investments, which is an 
increase of 1.9 billion yuan over 1993. All units should, in 
accordance with previously arranged construction projects, focus 
closely on linking together with management of construction 
banks and conduct evaluation work for new construction loan 
projects as quickly as possible to ensure that the loans are 
used according to schedule. 
  1994 is the year of the State's greatest reform efforts and 
a 
key year for completing the Eighth 5-Year Plan. The coal capital 
construction tasks are extremely heavy. The scale of mines (and 
strip mines) which we plan to place into production in 1994 is 
the greatest in one year during the past several years, and we 
should start focusing on this item of work from the beginning of 
the year and provide preferential guarantees for provision of 
the construction capital, the supplies of equipment and 
materials, and the construction staff arrangements required for 
these projects. All areas must work together to cooperate and 
ensure that tasks to place projects into operation during 1994 
are completed. For those key mines where construction will 
continue, coal washing plants, and other matching productive 
projects, we must focus on those key projects which concern 
construction schedules and provide overall benefits and make 
preferential arrangements. For regular projects where 
construction will be continuing, we must follow the previously 
arranged investment indices and take into consideration price 
increase factors, arrange for unit projects according to how 
much we have to invest, and not leave investment shortages.

Discovers 10 Million-Ton Grade Oil Field"] 
  [Text] The Jiangsu Petroleum Exploration Bureau discovered 
an oil field with 10 million tons of reserves on 25 March 1994, 
the Cuizhuang oil field. 
  This oil field is located in the Jinhu depression area of 
northern Jiangsu. This is the second large oil field the Jiangsu 
Petroleum Exploration Bureau has found in the 19 years since it 
was established, following the discovery of Zhenwu oil field. 
  The Jiangsu Petroleum Exploration Bureau began exploring the 
Cuizhuang region in 1976. In 1993, after completing a 
development economics assessment of this oil region and 
discussing a development program, the bureau transferred and 
concentrated its forces to undertake development battle work. It 
has been projected that a yearly production capacity of 100,000 
tons of crude oil may be formed by October 1994. 
  The discovery of Cuizhuang oil field once again illustrates 
the great prospects for oil and gas exploration in Jiangsu. 
After this oil field is completed and placed into production, 
the Jiangsu Petroleum Exploration Bureau's annual petroleum 
production capacity will surpass 1 million tons. This will play 
an important role in alleviating the Jiangsu region's energy 
shortages and spurring the development of Jiangsu's economy, 
especially the northern Jiangsu region.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Zeng Kun [2582 0981]: "Tarim Oil Field </F>
Begins Promoting Development of Bayangol, Formerly Little-Known, 
It Is Now World Famous"] 
  [Text] Now being developed by Tarim oil field, the formerly 
little-known Xinjiang's Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture 
has in one fell swoop become a hot area in China's economic 
development now and is attracting world attention. 
  Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, located in 
southeastern Xinjiang, covers an area of 483,000 square 
kilometers. Over one-half of China's large petroliferous basin, 
the Tarim Basin, lies within Bayangol Mongol Autonomous 
Prefecture. In early April 1989, the China Petroleum and Natural 
Gas Corporation established the Tarim Petroleum Exploration and 
Development Headquarters at Korla City, which subsequently 
opened a major petroleum exploration and development effort 
involving over 20,000 petroleum employees. In the past five 
years, they have proven six ready oil and gas fields at Lunnan, 
Donghetang, Sangtam, Jirak, Jiefang [Liberation] Canal East, and 
Central Tarim No. 4, and they have discovered 25 new industrial 
oil and gas-bearing structures. During the Eighth 5-Year Plan, 
they implemented reserve resources sufficient to build a 
production capacity of 5 million tons. This is especially true 
of the discovery of the Central Tarim No. 4 100-million-ton oil 
field, which has revealed the broad prospects for finding a 
cluster of huge oil fields in the central Tarim region. Now, the 
five oil fields at Lunnan, Donghetang, Sangtam, Jiefang Canal 
East, and Central Tarim Number 4 have formed a yearly crude oil 
production capacity of 2.1 million tons, and they have produced 
a total of 2.93 million tons over the past five years with a 
daily output level of 6,000 tons. 
  Oil field development has made Bayangol Mongol Autonomous 
Prefecture the most direct beneficiary. According to statistics, 
during the past five years of oil field development the oil 
field headquarters has made direct investments of more than 1 
billion yuan in Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture as well as 
indirect investments in establishing the materials supplies, 
communication and transportation, equipment maintenance, 
machinery processing, construction materials and chemical 
industry, design and construction, labor services, and other 
areas to support the oil field that totalled several billion 
yuan. Petroleum development has spurred rapid development of 
Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture's economy. During the past 
five years, Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture's GNP has 
doubled, its gross value of industrial and agricultural output 
has increased two-fold, and its financial income has increased 
1.5-fold. Enormous changes have occurred in the autonomous 
prefecture's communication, urban construction, posts and 
telecommunication, energy resources, and other basic facilities 
and it has become one of the few regions in Xinjiang with fully 
equipped highways, railroads, pipelines, aviation, and 
telecommunications.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Gao Xinghua [7559 5281 5478]: "China's </F>
First Quarter Onshore Crude Oil Output Surpasses 34 Million 
Tons"] 
  [Text] China's onshore petroleum production situation 
during the first quarter of 1994 was excellent, with total crude 
oil output exceeding 34 million tons and 24.7 percent of the 
annual plan being completed, up slightly over the same period 
during 1993. 
  An official in the China Petroleum and Natural Gas 
Corporation said the situation was "better than expected" and 
that this was mainly due to the oil fields of eastern China 
achieving stable production and to substantial increases in 
crude oil output in western China. Evidently, the strategy for 
achieving stability in the oil fields of eastern China is based 
on focusing on increasing output as quickly as possible, 
overcoming difficulties, and maintaining a steady output from 
the end of 1993. Crude oil output in western China was up by 
13.2 percent compared to the same period in 1993. 
  Total natural gas output during the first quarter was more 
than 3.9 billion cubic meters, equal to 25.4 percent of the 
annual plan and 104.5 percent of the same period in 1993. 
  During 1994 China expects to produce onshore 140 million 
tons 
of crude oil and 16 billion cubic meters of natural gas. 
Analysis by officials in the China Petroleum and Natural Gas 
Corporation indicates that these goals can be attained if we 
sustain the production momentum of the first quarter.

  [Text] Recently improved conditions ensure that large 
petroleum resources in the inland provinces of Shaanxi and 
Sichuan will be developed quickly, according to a senior 
petroleum official. 
  Highlighting the development are operations in the northern 
part of Shaanxi Province, where blocks totaling 40,000 square 
kilometres contain an estimated 1 billion tons of oil. 
  Preparations for development in Sichuan Province have also 
been progressing, according to executives with the China 
National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), which oversees on-shore oil 
operations. 
  In an interview, a senior official with the CNPC specified 
the improved conditions in northern Shaanxi: 


    -  Better relations between State-chartered oil firms and 
regional operators. The relations necessary for quick 
development were cemented by an agreement signed early this 
month by CNPC and provincial authorities. The agreement binds 
the CNPC and governments and enterprises in the province to join 
together to accelerate oil development. They will also 
co-operate to beef up protection of oil resources. Before long, 
the official said, millions of tons of oil are expected to be 
produced in the region each year. A large portion of the output 
is to be pumped by joint operations involving the CNPC, regional 
authorities and enterprises. 
  -  The availability of technology for 
developing oil there. Petroleum development started in the 
330,000-square-kilometre Shaan-Gan-Ning Basin 90 years ago, but 
only 2 percent of the resources has been recovered because of 
inadequate technology. 
  -  Enough evidence of easy drilling for oil 
lies only 500 to 1,500 metres underground, compared with several 
times that depth elsewhere in the country. 


    With the newly signed agreement, the CNPC official said, 
long-awaited large oilfields will be built in the area before 
long. 
  Over the past 18 months, hundreds of work units have rushed 
to drill wells there to extract oil that legally belongs to the 
State. These work units, inexperienced in oil operations, sought 
quick profits and had no long-term commitment to protecting the 
resources. 
  Their operations were inefficient and hindered overall 
planning, the official said.

<F P=106> [Article: "Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant's No. 2 Generator </F>
Achieves First Full-Power Operation on 25 March"] 
  [Text] Since being in a nuclear power generating state and 
starting to conduct a power generation experiment on 7 February 
1994, in strict accordance with the debugging program and the 
requirements of technical regulations, and under the supervision 
of the National Nuclear Safety Administration and through the 
joint efforts of all the units participating in the experiment, 
the No. 2 900MW nuclear power generator at Guangdong's Daya Bay 
Nuclear Power Plant completed readjustment experiments in 
sequence at 15 percent, 30 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent, 87 
percent, and 97 percent of its rated power safely, with high 
quality, and on schedule. Comprehensive inspection, 
readjustment, and checking of the generator's equipment and 
system states led to the generator's performance in every phase 
attaining its design requirements. At 1915 hours on 25 March 
1994, the No. 2 generator attained full power for the first time. 
  During the process of debugging operations, the Guangdong 
Electric Power Industry Corporation, Hong Kong's Zhonghua 
Electric Power Company, and Guangzhou Pumped-Storage Power Plant 
provided substantial support and coordination. This was 
especially true of the Guangdong Power Grid and the Hong Kong 
Zhonghua Electric Power Company's Jiulong [Kowloon] Power Grid, 
which, under the difficult conditions of a valley in electric 
power demand during the spring season, carefully arranged for 
the grid connection plan and guaranteed that the debugging of 
the No. 2 generator proceeded smoothly. 
  According to the original debugging plan, the No. 2 
generator 
will continue operating in a full-power state and, after 
undergoing all types of performance tests, demonstration 
operation, and maintenance work, will be placed into commercial 
operation.

"Unirradiated Fast Reactor (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] Fuel Dissolution 
Experiments"; manuscript received 20 August 1993, revised 
manuscript received 15 October 1993] 
  [Text] The dissolution behavior of unirradiated 
UO[.sub]2[/] and (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] fuel in nitric acid is 
studied. Detailed descriptions of the effects of nitric acid 
concentration, temperature, pellet processing methods, 
PuO[.sub]2[/] content, and other factors on dissolution rates 
are provided and plutonium valence state changes and undissolved 
residue contents during the dissolution process are 
measured. 
  It is common knowledge that complete dissolution of 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] is required to ensure recovery of the 
plutonium in the fuel reprocessing process and prevent 
criticality accidents. Thus, fast reactor fuel dissolution 
experiments are very important for improving and evaluating fuel 
pellet fabrication techniques and designing fuel reprocessing 
flow processes. 
  Much research has been done in foreign countries on 
dissolution of fast reactor mixed oxide fuel elements in nitric 
acid[.sup][1-5][/]. The results show that the dissolution 
rate of fuel pellets is related to many factors. China's fast 
reactor research work is just beginning and the first batch of 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] fuel pellets that we developed are limited 
in number and have not been placed in the reactor and 
irradiated. Thus, to obtain data on Chinese-made fast reactor 
mixed oxide fuel dissolution as quickly as possible, we only 
studied the more important variables such as nitric acid 
concentration, temperature, pellet processing methods, 
PuO[.sub]2[/] content, and so on. 
  The research work was divided into two stages. First, we 
used 
UO[.sub]2[/] to conduct simulated fast reactor fuel 
dissolution experiments in the China Atomic Energy Scientific 
Research Academy and, after gaining some experience, we carried 
out dissolution of unirradiated (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets at 
the Lanzhou Nuclear Fuel Plant. The results of the experiments 
show that the first batch of (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] fuel pellets 
developed in China had excellent dissolution properties and that 
their dissolution rate and undissolved residues could satisfy 
reprocessing requirements.

UO[.sub]2[/] pellets) of HNO[.sub]3[/] or 
HNO[.sub]3[/]-HF solution at a specific concentration. After 
preheating to the experimental temperature, we placed one 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellet into the loading port and dissolved 
it. At different times, we removed 0.1 ml of the dissolved 
liquid (1 ml was removed for the UO[.sub]2[/] pellets) and 
measured the uranium and plutonium concentrations and plutonium 
valence states. Usually, the pellets were dissolved for 5 hours 
and then filtered out of the dissolved liquid. After using 
dilute acid to wash the undissolved residues and filter paper, 
we placed them in a magnetic crucible and incinerated them for 1 
hour in a muffle furnace (600C), after which we weighed the 
undissolved residues in a 1:10,000 balance. We boiled and 
dissolved the residues in 50 ml of 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/]-0.05 mol/l HF for 1 hour, anaylzed the uranium 
and plutonium in the residue solution, calculated the 
uranium/plutonium ratio, and measured the amount of the residues 
using the symmetrical weight method. 
  The dissolution experiments on the UO[.sub]2[/] and 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets were carried out, respectively, in 
a common radiation chemistry laboratory and a special glove box 
in the reprocessing plant, and all analysis of the 
plutonium-bearing samples was conducted in the glove box. 
  Unless otherwise indicated, in the coprecipitated pellets 
used in the experiments, the pellets had a PuO[.sub]2[/] 
content of 27 percent, the dissolution acidity was 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/], and the temperature was the boiling point (BP). 
<H5>  D. Analytical methods </H5>
  1. Uranium: measured directly using spectrophotometry (415 
nm). When the uranium contained plutonium, it was measured using 
Br-PADAP spectrophotometry[.sup][6][/]. 
  2. Plutonium: measured using the 17 keV X-ray measurement 
method[.sup][7][/]. 
  3. Pu(IV) and Pu(VI): measured using the TTA or PMBP 
extraction method[.sup][8][/]. 
<H5>  II. Results and Discussion </H5>
<H5>  A. UO </H5>[.sub]2[/] Fuel Pellet Dissolution 
  1. Dissolution curve. Figure 1 shows the dissolution curve 
of 
the UO[.sub]2[/] pellets. The curve starts out relatively 
flat and then rises quickly, after which it again flattens and 
gradually reaches the end point of dissolution. A dissolution 
curve with this shape can be interpreted using changes in the 
effective surface area during the dissolution process. There was 
a large amount of excess nitric acid in the experiments and the 
acidity and other conditions basically did not change during the 
experiments, so the dissolution rate (mg/cm[.sup]2[/]) can be 
considered constant. Because there is a positive ratio between 
the amount of pellet dissolution per unit of time and the 
effective dissolution surface area and because the initial 
surface (processed surface) of the pellet at the start of 
dissolution is relatively smooth and the effective surface area 
is smaller, the amount of dissolution is also smaller. As 
dissolution continued, the surface of the pellet became 
increasingly rougher and the effective surface area also 
continued to increase. According to estimates by 
Uriarte[.sup][2][/], the surface roughness at 50 percent 
dissolution of the uranium pellet is increased three- to 
five-fold, and as a result there is a sharp increase in the 
amount of dissolution. As the remaining pellet becomes 
increasingly smaller, its surface area is also gradually reduced 
so that the amount of dissolution becomes smaller as a result 
until the end point of dissolution. Actually, measurement of the 
effective surface area during the dissolution process is very 
difficult, so Uriarte used the concept of a Roughness Constant 
(RC) to do a quantitative description of changes in the surface 
of the pellets during the dissolution process that is computed 
using the formula below: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-21A>           Figure 1 </FIG>




<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-22A>             Equation </FIG>


  R[.sub]0[/], R[.sub]k[/], and R[.sub]n[/] are, 
respectively, the radius of the pellet at the instant when 
dissolution begins, in the middle, and at the final instant, and 
RF is the roughness factor. It can be derived by dividing the 
amount of pellet that is dissolved per unit of time by the 
amount that should be dissolved to maintain the surface 
smoothness and the constant dissolution rate. 
  2. Effects of nitric acid concentration. The UO[.sub]2[/] 
can undergo the following types of reactions when being 
dissolved in nitric acid[.sup][4][/]: 
  UO[.sub]2[/] + 4HNO[.sub]3[/] 
UO[.sub]2[/](NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/] + 2NO[.sub]2[/] 
+ 2H[.sub]2[/]O 
  UO[.sub]2[/] + 8/3HNO[.sub]3[/] 
UO[.sub]2[/](NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/] + 
2/3NO[.sub]2[/] + 4/3H[.sub]2[/]O 
  UO[.sub]2[/] + 3HNO[.sub]3[/] 
UO[.sub]2[/](NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/] + 1/2NO + 
1/2NO[.sub]2[/] + 3/2H[.sub]2[/]O 
  Like the dissolution of metallic uranium, there is no common 
chemical reaction that can completely represent the actual 
dissolution process. In the experiments we compared the 
dissolution of the UO[.sub]2[/] pellets in 12 mol/l, 8 mol/l, 
and 4 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]. The results indicate that as the 
acidity is reduced the dissolution rate drops quickly (Figure 
1). In dissolution for three hours at 4 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/], 
the amount of dissolution was only about 15 percent. 
  3. Effects of temperature. Dissolution experiments were 
conducted at different temperatures. The results show that the 
dissolution rate at 100C is slightly lower than the 
dissolution rate below the boiling point (Figure 2). 
Nevertheless, because the dissolution was steady at 100C, 
it still has substantial attractiveness for use in industrial 
production. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-22B>           Equation </FIG>

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-22C>           Equation </FIG>


<H5>  B. (U,Pu)O </H5>[.sub]2[/] fuel pellet dissolution 
  1. Dissolution curve. Figure 3 shows a typical 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellet dissolution curve. Like the 
UO[.sub]2[/] pellets, the curve is flat for a period of time 
as dissolution starts and then becomes significantly steeper 
until it eventually re-flattens and reaches the dissolution end 
point. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-010-22D> Figure 2 </FIG>

  2. Effects of nitric acid concentration. The dissolution 
rate 
of the (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets depends significantly on the 
dissolution acidity (Figure 3). For example, in dissolution for 
three hours in 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/], the amount of pellet 
dissolution is greater than 95 percent, but is just 30 percent 
in 4 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]. 
  3. Effects of temperature. In a dissolution situation 
similar 
to that of the UO[.sub]2[/] pellets, there is also a 
corresponding reduction in the dissolution rate of the 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets as the dissolution temperature is 
reduced from the boiling point to 100C (Figure 4). This 
result is consistent with the result in article [4]. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  4. Effects of hydrofluoric acid. Just as was pointed out in 
many articles, adding 0.05 mol/l of HF to the nitric acid can 
significantly increase the dissolution rate of the 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets. The results of our experiments 
(Figure 5) show that in the initial stage of dissolution, the 
addition of HF significantly accelerates pellet dissolution. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  5. Effects of pellet processing methods. The effects of 
pellet processing methods on the dissolution rate of the 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets are shown in Figure 6. One can see 
in Figure 6 that the mechanically blended pellets have a faster 
dissolution rate than the coprecipitated pellets. This 
experimental result is consistent with article [2], but 
contradicts the data in article [1]. The cause of this situation 
could be related to different pellet sources and processing 
parameters. In our experiments, we discovered that the sintered 
density of the mechanically blended pellets was relatively low 
and that they had a loose structure, so that when being boiled 
in 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/] they fractured very quickly into a 
heap of powder, which obviously would help accelerate 
dissolution. However, this situation occurred in the 
coprecipitated pellets only after most of the pellets had been 
dissolved. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  6. Effects of PuO[.sub]2[/] content. The effect of the 
PuO[.sub]2[/] content in the (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets on 
the dissolution rate is shown in Figure 7. One can see in Figure 
7 that the higher the PuO[.sub]2[/] content, the slower the 
rate of dissolution. Koch[.sup][9][/] feels that in actual 
use, to maintain a reasonable dissolution rate, the 
PuO[.sub]2[/] content should be less than 40 percent. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  7. Undissolved residues. After the pellets had been 
dissolved 
for five hours, the solution still contained a small amount of 
undissolved residues. Their content varied according to pellet 
processing method, batch number, and dissolution conditions. It 
was 0.03 to 0.5 percent for the coprecipitated pellets and 0.3 
to 1.6 percent for the mechanically blended pellets (Table 2). 
This data is basically identical to that reported in article [1].

  Observed under the microscope, the particles of the 
undissolved residues are very small, usually smaller than 1 
m 
to 10 m. Figure 8 is a photograph of the particles of the 
undissolved residues. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Chemical analysis shows that the plutonium content of the 
undissolved residues significantly exceeds the initial plutonium 
content of the pellets. For example, the initial 
m[.sub]U[/]/m[.sub]Pu[/] was 2.7 in the 27 percent 
PuO[.sub]2[/]-UO[.sub]2[/] pellets, but after dissolution 
for five hours in boiling 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/] the 
m[.sub]U[/]/m[.sub]Pu[/] in the residue dropped to about 
0.5. The undissolved residues were very easily dissolved in 12 
mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]-0.05 mol/l HF. 
  8. Uranium optimum solution phenomenon. When 
Lerch[.sup][1][/] used boiling 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/] to 
dissolve mechanically blended (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets, he 
discovered that the dissolution rate of UO[.sub]2[/] was 
significantly faster than the dissolution rate of 
PuO[.sub]2[/]. We also discovered this type of "uranium 
optimum solution" phenomenon in our experiments on dissolution 
of mechanically blended pellets, but this type of phenomenon did 
not appear in the coprecipitated pellets (Figure 9). A possible 
interpretation is that the mechanically blended pellets have a 
loose texture and break down in the initial period of 
dissolution into a powdered form. Everyone knows that the 
dissolution rate of UO[.sub]2[/] in concentrated nitric acid 
is faster than that of PuO[.sub]2[/], so the dissolution 
curve of UO[.sub]2[/] appears above that of PuO[.sub]2[/]. 
For the coprecipitated pellets, dissolution basically occurs on 
the surface of the pellets while the pellet surface causes 
uranium optimum solution to occur, which does not have too great 
of an effect on the UO[.sub]2[/] dissolution curve and does 
not lead to the occurrence of "separation" phenomena in the 
UO[.sub]2[/] and PuO[.sub]2[/] dissolution curves. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  9. Acid consumption. The experiments were conducted in 
conditions of a large excess of nitric acid. Analysis of the 
acidity at the end point of dissolution shows that in the 12 
mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/] boiling dissolution coprecipitated pellet 
experiments, 1 mol of (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] consumed 6 mol of 
nitric acid. Because of condensation efficiency differences in 
the condensing tubes and the escape of part of the nitric acid 
vapor from the sampling port due to frequent sampling, the 
actual acid consumption used for dissolution of the pellets 
would be lower than this value. 
  10. Plutonium valence states. The valence states of the 
plutonium in the fuel pellet solution constitute an important 
reference value for subsequent value readjustment steps. In a 
situation of concentrated nitric acid boiling dissolution, 
Pu(III) cannot exist, so we only tracked and analyzed Pu(IV) and 
Pu(VI). The results show that the plutonium in the solution 
exists primarily as Pu(IV) while the Pu(VI) content varies 
depending on the pellet processing methods and dissolution 
conditions (Table 3). Overall, there are these regularities: 1) 
As the dissolution time increases, there is a tendency for the 
Pu(VI) content to increase; 2) At low dissolution temperatures, 
the Pu(VI) content is also low; 3) The Pu(VI) content in the 
mechanically blended pellets is higher than in the 
coprecipitated pellets.

<H5>  III. Conclusion </H5>
  1. With some exceptions, the pellets in the research 
dissolved easily in boiling 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]. 
  2. When the dissolution acidity was reduced from 12 mol/l to 
4 mol/l, there was a significant reduction in the dissolution 
rate of the UO[.sub]2[/] and (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets. 
  3. Below the boiling point, the dissolution rate of the 
UO[.sub]2[/] and (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets in 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/] was faster than at 100C. 
  4. The dissolution rate of the 27 percent 
PuO[.sub]2[/]-UO[.sub]2[/] pellets in boiling 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/] was faster than the 35 percent 
PuO[.sub]2[/]-UO[.sub]2[/] pellets. 
  5. Under the experimental conditions, the dissolution rate 
of 
the mechanically blended pellets was slightly faster than the 
dissolution rate of the coprecipitated pellets. 
  6. In the dissolution experiments on the mechanically 
blended 
pellets, a uranium optimum solution phenomenon was observed. 
  7. When the 27 percent PuO[.sub]2[/]-UO[.sub]2[/] 
pellets were dissolved for five hours in boiling 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/], the solution retained a small amount of 
undissolved residues. The content was 0.1 to 0.5 percent for the 
coprecipitated pellets and 0.3 to 1.6 percent for the 
mechanically blended pellets. 
  8. All of the (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets and the 
undissolved residues in the experiments dissolved easily in 
boiling 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]-0.05 mol/l HF. 
  9. The plutonium in the solution exists mainly as Pu(IV) 
while the Pu(VI) content varies with pellet processing methods 
and dissolution conditions and increases as the dissolution time 
is increased. Dissolved for five hours in boiling 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/], the Pu(VI) content can reach 30 percent.

Successfully Develops "O"-Shaped Sealing Rings for Pressure 
Vessels"] 
  [Text] Success has now been achieved in Sichuan in the 
reactor "O"-shaped sealing rings developed by the China Nuclear 
Power Academy. This is another breakthrough in research for 
shifting to domestic production of nuclear power equipment that 
follows China's successful development of nuclear power plant 
pressure vessel steel, no-leak safety valves, dual-channel 
neutron boron tables, and other achievements in our shift to 
domestic production of nuclear power plant equipment and it has 
major significance for China's achievement of a shift to 
domestic production of nuclear power equipment. 
  The "O"-shaped sealing rings for reactor pressure vessels 
are 
one of the key components to ensure safe reactor operation. The 
difficulty of their development lies in the need for the sealing 
rings to ensure that no nuclear leaks occur under conditions of 
high-temperature and high-pressure intense irradiation, which 
places rather high requirements on their materials and 
technology. The S&amp;T personnel of the China Nuclear Power 
Academy 
employed thick-walled tube casing and thick-walled spherical 
casing theory and used non-continuous analysis methods and 
iterative algorithms to successfully analyze the flange seal 
performance problems of reactor pressure vessels. Because they 
considered the coupling action of bolts, temperature, friction, 
and other areas, they achieved innovations and developments. 
  The "O"-shaped sealing rings can be widely used as pressure 
vessel seals in nuclear power plants, reactors, and other power 
reactors such as nuclear submarine reactors, and they can be 
used as high-temperature and high-pressure vessel seals in the 
petrochemical and chemical industries, thermal power plants, and 
so on.

Becomes Nuclear Power Equipment Manufacturing Base, Successive 
Power Generation at Qinshan and Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plants 
Shows China's Nuclear Power Industry Has Entered a New 
Development Phase"] 
  [Text] I learned from the Shanghai Municipality Nuclear 
Society's Special Nuclear Power Equipment Commission established 
on 8 April 1994 that successive connection to the grid and power 
generation at Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant and Daya Bay Nuclear 
Power Plant are indications that China's nuclear power industry 
has entered a new development phase. Now, Shanghai's power plant 
industry, which was involved in manufacturing the equipment for 
both nuclear power plants, has signed a technical agreement to 
manufacture the equipment for two 600MW nuclear power plants for 
the second phase at Qinshan, and the manufacturing contract for 
part of the equipment for the 300MW nuclear power plant to be 
exported to Pakistan has also been signed, making Shanghai 
China's nuclear power equipment manufacturing base area. 
Shanghai Municipality Deputy Mayor Zhao Qizheng [6392 0796 2973] 
attended the meeting and gave a speech. 
  Shanghai has already invested nearly 200 million yuan to 
develop our nuclear power industry and it has completed several 
nuclear power technical measures capital construction projects 
on a substantial scale with a total structural area of 93,000 
square meters, including seven 100- to 400-ton plant buildings. 
The Shanghai Municipal Government has also included nuclear 
power as one of Shanghai Municipality's 14 projects to attack 
key problems in integrating S&amp;T with production. Since 
starting 
in 1988, Shanghai Municipality's financial administration has 
issued over 13 million yuan in loans to support attacks on key 
S&amp;T problems in nuclear power projects, and by the end of 
1993 
it had established 88 topics, 62 of which had passed examination 
and acceptance. At the same time, with support from the relevant 
ministries, commissions, and offices of the State Council, 11 of 
the topics among the State's projects to attack key problems 
related to 600MW nuclear power projects during the Eighth 5-Year 
Plan have been assigned to Shanghai Municipality and it has 
allocated more than 12 million yuan in funds to spur Shanghai to 
improve its nuclear power equipment manufacturing capabilities. 
  To ensure that the tasks for the Qinshan second-phase 
nuclear 
power project and the Pakistan nuclear power project are 
completed, Shanghai has decided to invest an additional 200 
million yuan-plus in capital during the Eighth 5-Year Plan for 
technical upgrading to fill in and supplement the more than 20 
plants that will assume responsibility for nuclear power tasks, 
and the municipality plans to gradually form an annual 
production capacity to produce 1 to 1.5 sets of nuclear power 
equipment during the Ninth 5-Year Plan.

  [Excerpts] Hong Kong, 18 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- 
Since Zhejiang's Qinshan nuclear power plant and Guangdong's 
Daya Bay nuclear power plant went into operation, the Beijing 
authorities have started preparations for more nuclear plants to 
be built across the country by the end of this century and early 
next century so as to alleviate the country's energy shortage. 
It has been learned that while Zhejiang and Guangdong are 
preparing to build their second nuclear power plants, Fujian, 
Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, Hainan, and some other 
provinces also are making preliminary preparations for building 
their own nuclear power plants. Moreover, provinces like Jilin, 
Sichuan, and Heilongjiang are already conducting feasibility 
studies for nuclear energy development. As the country has only 
limited construction funds, the departments concerned are 
expected to invite overseas investment and foreign funds to help 
with the country's nuclear development. 
  Slow energy development and a 20-plus percent shortage of 
electrical energy supply in the country has impeded the 
nationwide economic growth to some extent. In order to meet the 
growing demand for electrical energy and to guarantee a 
sufficient electrical energy supply across the country, apart 
from building more thermal power and hydropower stations, the 
authorities also are determined to speed up the country's 
nuclear energy development, as this causes less pollution. 
  It has been learned that since the two 900MW units installed 
at Daya Bay went into operation, Guangdong has decided to build 
its second nuclear power station in Lingao, north of Daya Bay, 
and a third one in Yangjiang. Construction of the Lingao and 
Yangjiang nuclear power plants is scheduled to be completed 
around the year 2002. The two nuclear power plants are to have 
four and six generating sets, respectively. By the year 2002, 
Guangdong's three nuclear power plants are expected to have a 
combined installed capacity of 10 million kWh, thus basically 
meeting the province's demand for electrical energy. 
  In Zhejiang, a 300MW generator installed at Qinshan during 
the first-phase construction has gone into operation. Now, two 
other 600MW generating sets are being installed as well as 
second-phase construction at the Qinshan nuclear power plant has 
begun. The two new generating sets are scheduled to go into 
operation in 1996. Zhejiang also has decided to build two 
2000MW nuclear power plants along its coast, in Sanmen Bay and 
Leqing, respectively. They are scheduled to go into operation 
by the turn of the century. 
  Moreover, a number of provinces with conditions for nuclear 
energy development are also preparing to build nuclear plants. 
Fujian is planning to build a nuclear plant in Shanqian 
township, Huian County, at the mouth of Quanzhou Bay. The plant 
will have six 900MW generating sets, with a combined installed 
capacity of 5.4 million kWh when its three-phase construction is 
completed. The plant will have generating sets when its 
first-phase construction is completed early in the next century. 
  Jiangxi also has decided to build a 3600MW nuclear plant at 
Maoziding Mountain in Guze County, Jiujiang City. Hainan 
Province is seeking a site on which to build a nuclear power 
plant, and is conducting feasibility studies regarding the 
first-phase construction of a 300MW generating set. Liaoning 
Province has decided to build a 1000MW nuclear plant in 
Wentuozi. Jiangsu, Shandong, and other provinces are conducting 
feasibility studies for building nuclear power plants. 
  It has been learned that apart from inviting urgently needed 
funds for its nuclear development from some foreign countries 
and regions, the country still will try to raise most of the 
funds it needs for this purpose in cooperation with the local 
departments concerned. This is why the Beijing authorities 
have decided to set up a rotating fund mechanism for nuclear 
development to guarantee a continued supply of funds for the 
country's nuclear power development. Minister of Power Industry 
Shi Dazhen pointed out that under the proposed rotation 
mechanism for nuclear development, after a nuclear power plant 
is built and goes into operation, the State will not try to 
collect its profits. Instead, the plant's profits will be used 
to build other nuclear power plants so that more such plants can 
be built across the country. The nuclear power plant is allowed 
to divert as much as 2.3 billion yuan of profits to other 
nuclear plants under construction so that more provinces will be 
able to build nuclear power plants. 
  Guangdong's Daya Bay nuclear power plant has been installed 
with French advanced pressurized-water reactors. In the future, 
the country is likely to continue purchasing French equipment 
for its nuclear plants, but as the Shanghai-made nuclear 
reactors installed at Qinshan have proven to be perfectly 
reliable and efficient, the country is more likely to use more 
domestically manufactured equipment. As a result, Shanghai 
certainly will become the country's nuclear equipment supply 
base.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  The thermal stress relaxation of PSZ-Mo functionally 
gradient 
material (FGM) during fabrication is optimally designed. The 
thermal stress distribution induced during the fabrication of a 
two-layer laminated PSZ-Mo material (a non-FGM or NFGM) is 
analyzed by the finite element method (FEM). The distribution 
and relaxation pattern of thermal stress in the PSZ-Mo system 
FGM during fabrication are also analyzed. The relationship 
between the thermal stress and the composition distribution 
exponent P for PSZ-Mo FGM during fabrication is 
obtained. The optimum thermal relaxation P value for 
the material system in this investigation is determined by 
thermal stress analysis. In this investigation, the FGM 
fabrication technique is also studied. FGM specimens with the 
dimensions of 24mm x 5.6mm (diameter x thickness) and 30mm x 
5mm, respectively, are successfully fabricated by a powder 
metallurgy method. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  A study of functionally gradient materials (FGMs) with 
thermal relaxation property is conducted to meet future 
high-tech demands such as for space materials. The FGMs to be 
developed are the high-quality insulation and heat-resistant 
materials with continuous variations of composition, structure, 
and properties.[.sup]1[/] 
  This investigation measures the property parameters of the 
PSZ-Mo system FGM in different compositions. Based on these 
measured data, the distribution and relaxation rules of 
diametrical stress _s_[.sub]rr[/], circumferential stress 
_s_[.sub]_th__th_[/], and axial stress _s_[.sub]zz[/] for a 

circular specimen are analyzed; the relationship between the 
thermal stress magnitude of the PSZ-Mo system FGM and the 
composition distribution index P is disclosed; and 
the best P value for thermal stress relaxation is 
determined through thermal stress analysis of the system under 
study. The FEM is used to analyze the _s_[.sub]rr[/], 
_s_[.sub]_th__th_[/], and _s_[.sub]zz[/] distributions of a 

two-layer laminated PSZ-Mo material during processing. 
Additionally, based on the analytical results, FGM fabrication 
techniques are researched, and FGM specimens free from 
macro-defects are produced. 
<H5>  2. Thermal Stress Relaxation Design, Optimum Composition </H5>
Distribution Design of PSZ-Mo System FGM 
  The raw materials used for the experiment are as follows: 
ZrO[.sub]2[/] with an average particle size of 0.5 m and a 
purity of 99.9 percent; Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], 0.03 m 
and 99.99 percent; Mo, 3 m and 99.90 percent. The test 
specimens of the six compositions are made according to the 
following procedure: pressed with cold isostatic pressure of 200 
MPa, sintered at 1500C for 2 hours under a vacuum of 1 x 
10[.sup]-3[/] Pa. The specimens are polished for property 
parameter measurement. The elastic moduli and bending stresses 
are measured by the three-point bending test with a MTS-810 
material tester (the averaged value of five specimens is adopted 
for the analysis). The thermal expansion coefficient is measured 
with a PZ-2 quartz expansometer (the averaged value of three 
specimens is adopted). Table 1 displays the property parameter 
test data. It shows that there is a quasi-linear relationship 
between the thermal expansion coefficient _a_ and the specimen 
volume fraction. However, the relationship of either Young's 
modulus E or bending strength _s_[.sub]b[/] with the specimen 
composite volume fraction does not follow a simple linear rule, 
as both are affected by the microstructure of the sintered 
material.

  One quarter of the circular test specimen is analyzed with 
the FEM. The test specimen is designed to contain 15 layers. The 
aforementioned test values are used as the parameters for 
thermal stress analysis. The properties of the specimen 
compositions other than those of the 15 layers are determined by 
Lagrangian interpolation. For FEM analysis, one-quarter specimen 
from the two-layer laminated PSZ/Mo material is divided into 960 
elements; and one-quarter specimen of FGM is divided into 1,400 
elements. In the calculation, it is assumed that during cooling 
from 1500C to 25C, the specimen deformation is 
elastic, not plastic.

_s_[.sub]_th__th_[/] and _s_[.sub]rr[/] are same. Table 2

  Figures 1a and 1b show the stress distributions on both 
sides 
of the two-layer boundary. Figure 1a shows that 
_s_[.sub]rr[/] is compressive on the metal side, and tensile 
on the ceramic side. The maximum stress concentration is located 
close to either side of the boundary surface. The stress 
gradually decreases away from the boundary surface. This 
phenomenon is caused by the fact that in the PSZ-Mo system 
selected for this study the thermal expansion coefficient of Mo 
is smaller than that of PSZ. Hence, at high temperature, the 
expansion magnitude of PSZ is larger than that of the metal. 
Consequently, near the boundary, the metal side endures 
compression, and the ceramic side endures tension. But in the 
locations farther away from the boundary, the metal endures 
tension, and the ceramic, compression. This pattern of 
_s_[.sub]rr[/] stress distribution causes warping of the 
specimen toward the ceramic side. Figure 1b shows the pattern of 
_s_[.sub]zz[/] distribution: tension on the metal side, and 
compression on the ceramic side. The maximum stresses also 
concentrate in areas close to both sides of the boundary 
surface. This stress mode tends to cause fracture along the 
boundary between the layers. The conclusions are that the 
deformation of PSZ-Mo two-layer laminated material after 
sintering will cause warping toward the ceramic side, and the 
separation of layers along the boundary surfaces are identical 
with the deformation observed in the prepared specimens. The 
aforementioned also describes the deformation of the Mo and PSZ 
layered specimen made by cold iso-static pressing and then 
sintered at 1500C for 2 hours under 1 x 10[.sup]-3[/] Pa 
vacuum. 
<H5>  2.2 Thermal Stress Analysis of the PSZ-Mo System FGM </H5>
  The PSZ-Mo system FGM contains 15 layers, whose compositions 
vary continuously from the metallic to the ceramic. The 
composition distribution curves are based on the equation _P_ 
= 
(x/d)[.sup]P[/],[.sup]2[/] where _P_ is the PSZ 
volume fraction; d, the specimen thickness; x, the position of a 
certain PSZ composition; and P, PSZ composition 
distribution pattern index. Figure 2 shows the distribution 
curves. The composition distribution pattern indices, 
P = 0.6, 1.0, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.2, are selected 
for the design and calculation of thermal stress relaxation and 
improvement. Figure 3 shows the results. It shows that within 
the range P = 0.6 to 2.2, the maximum stress of any 
one composition distribution is smaller than the maximum stress 
of the two-layer laminated material, which means that 
composition gradient obviously relaxes the material's internal 
thermal stress and the stress induced during fabrication. 
Besides, at the initial stage, the _s_[.sub]rr[/] and 
_s_[.sub]zz[/] (the distribution and the magnitude of 
_s_[.sub]_th__th_[/] and _s_[.sub]rr[/] are approximately 
the same) decrease with increase in P, and reach 
their minimum values when P = 1.6. After this point, 
the stresses increase with increase in the P value. 
The data show that for the PSZ-Mo system FGM, there exists an 
optimum P value, i.e. 1.6, which induces the least 
thermal stress with the largest range for thermal stress 
relaxation. Compared with the two-layer laminated material, the 
_s_[.sub]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]zz[/] decrease by 32 percent 
and 76 percent, respectively. This demonstrates that the 
gradient composition of a material obviously relaxes the thermal 
stress induced during fabrication. Especially, the wide 
_s_[.sub]zz[/] relaxation range greatly reduces the 
delamination tendency along the Z-axis. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 2. Distribution Curves of Composition&lt;/graphic&gt; 


  &lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 3. _s_[.sub]rr[/] and 
_s_[.sub]zz[/] as a Function of P&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Figures 4a and 4b show respectively the iso-stress profiles 
of _s_[.sub]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]zz[/] of the gradient 
material, calculated by the FEM when P = 1.6. The 
iso-stress profiles disclose that the maximum stresses of 
_s_[.sub]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]zz[/] do not occur at the 
metal-ceramic boundary, but distribute within certain different 
composition zones. This illustrates that the composition 
gradient eliminates fractures due to maximum boundary stresses. 
Furthermore, comparing Figures 1a and 1b with 4a and 4b, we can 
see that the maximum tensile stress of _s_[.sub]rr[/] drops 
from +278 MPa to +189 MPa, the maximum tensile stress of 
_s_[.sub]zz[/] drops from +180 MPa to +42.6 MPa, and the 
maximum compression stress on the ceramic side rises from -136 
MPa to -170 MPa. As far as ceramic materials are concerned, the 
decrease of tensile stress and the increase of compressive 
stress are beneficial. To sum up, the composition gradient of a 
material not only relaxes the material from internal thermal 
stress, but also changes its internal stress distribution, thus 
greatly improving the material.

_s_[.sub]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]zz[/] 
for PSZ-Mo FGM&lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  3. Fabrication of PSZ-Mo System FGM </H5>
  Fifteen PSZ-Mo powder mixes of different compositions are 
prepared. Based on the aforementioned optimal design for thermal 
stress relaxation and improvement, P = 1.6 is 
selected. According to the equation _P_ = 
(x/d)[.sup]P[/], the corresponding filling 
thickness of each composition is determined. Figure 5 shows the 
graph of composition distribution versus layer thickness. The 
specimen is first filled layer by layer with powders of 
different compositions. Then it is cold iso-static pressed under 
a pressure of 200 MPa, and subsequently sintered at 1500C 
for 2 hours in a 10[.sup]-3[/] Pa vacuum. A FGM specimen with 
dimensions of 24mm x 5.6mm (diameter x thickness) and free of 
macro-defects is made. Figure 6 shows the electron microprobe 
spectra of the specimen cross section from the metal side to the 
ceramic side. It shows the continuous composition change from 
the metal side to the ceramic side: the Mo content gradually 
decreases as the Zr content gradually increases. In addition, 
another PSZ-Mo system FGM specimen with dimensions of 30mm x 5mm 
without macro-defects is made by a hot-pressing process with a 
pressure of 30 MPa at 1700C for 3 hours, followed with 
pressure release at 1200C. Figure 7 [photographs not 
reproduced] shows specimens made by hot pressing and vacuum 
sintering, respectively.

<H5>  4. Conclusions </H5>
  (1) The composition gradient of the PSZ-Mo system material 
relaxes the thermal stress induced during fabrication, and when 
P = 1.6, the most obvious relaxation occurs. 
  (2) Based on the optimal design results of thermal stress 
relaxation, two FGM specimens with dimensions of _P_24mm x 
5.6mm 
and _P_30mm x 5mm, respectively, are made by a powder-layering 
method. The specimens do not display any macro-defects.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  Microfine PLZT (La/Zr/Ti = 9/65/35) powder is synthesized by 
sol-gel method from metal isopropylates as raw materials. The 
effects of technical parameters such as the pH values, solvents, 
and drying processes on gelling time and gel properties are 
studied. The transition process from gel to PLZT powder is 
investigated with XRD and TG-DTA [thermogravimetry/differential 
thermal analysis]. The effects of gel structure and roasting 
temperature on the properties of PLZT powder are also examined 
with XRD and TG-DTA. Experiments show that the gel forms PLZT 
solid solution at 520C and that when roasted at 550C, 
the gel produces PLZT powder with particle diameter smaller than 
0.2 m. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The ceramic (Pb, La)(Zr, Ti)O[.sub]3[/] (PLZT) has good 
electro-optic properties. Especially, PLZT thin film has great 
application potential in optoelectronic devices such as 
photo-sensitive valves, electro-optic displays, etc. Recently, 
other countries have researched various synthesizing methods to 
make PLZT ceramic powders, among which are the solid state 
method,[.sup]1[/] the co-precipitation method,[.sup]2[/] 
the alkoxide hydrolysis method,[.sup]3-5[/] etc. This 
investigation adopts a sol-gel method. The different raw 
materials of proper compositions in solution state are first 
mixed; thus, the mixing proceeds among the molecules. The final 
powder product made from the solution has superior properties 
such as very fine particle size, precise chemical composition, 
good uniformity, high reactivity, and low synthetic temperature. 
The future of the sol-gel process is appealing. 
  Fine powder with the composition of (Pb[.sub]0.91[/], 
La[.sub]0.09[/])(Zr[.sub]0.65[/], 
Ti[.sub]0.35[/])O[.sub]3[/], or PLZT (La/Zr/Ti = 9/65/35) 
is prepared by the sol-gel method with metal isopropylates as 
raw materials. The effect of gelation process on gel properties, 
as well as the effect of gel quality and roasting temperature on 
powder particle size and properties are studied. Some useful 
results are obtained. 
<H5>  2. Experimental Work </H5>
<H5>  2.1 Preparation of Raw Materials </H5>
  (Note: All the experimental chemical agents are either 
analytically pure or chemically pure.) 
  Preparation of Zirconium Isopropylate and Titanium 
Isopropylate: Zirconium isopropylate and titanium isopropylate 
are prepared by the following equations: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Preparation of Lead Isopropylate: Pure dehydrated lead 
acetate is prepared by heating trihydrate lead acetate at 
80C-90C for 8 hours. Sodium isopropylate is prepared 
through the refluxed reaction between a proper amount of 
metallic sodium and isopropyl alcohol at 40C to 50C 
for 1 hour. After that, lead acetate and a proper amount of 
benzene are added into the bath. The refluxed reaction is 
continued for another 2 hours. Finally, lead isopropylate is 
obtained by filtering the solution and removing the benzene at a 
reduced pressure. The reaction is shown as follows: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Preparation of Lanthanum Isopropylate: First, 
LaCl[.sub]3[/] is prepared from the reaction between 
La[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and NH[.sub]4[/]Cl; then the 
reaction of LaCl[.sub]3[/] with sodium isopropylate produces 
La(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]3[/] according to 
the following equation: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  2.2 Preparation of Gel and PLZT </H5>
  According to the molar ratio, specific amounts of 
Pb(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]2[/] and 
La(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]3[/] are loaded in a 
three-port flask. A proper amount of isopropyl alcohol is then 
added into the flask and the reaction is refluxed for 1 hour. 
Then, the isopropyl alcohol solutions of 
Ti(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]4[/] and 
Zr(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]4[/] are 
successively and gradually added, and the reaction is refluxed 
for another hour before a proper amount of water is added to the 
solution. The specific pH value of the solution is adjusted with 
HAc and NH[.sub]4[/]OH. The refluxing goes on until the 
solution turns into sol, which is transferred to a plastic 
container. The assembly is transferred to a clean location. At 
room temperature the sol turns into wet gel, then the wet gel is 
dried into dry gel under certain conditions. 
  The dry gel is loaded in a muffle furnace. After the furnace 
temperature is raised to 550C at a prescribed heating rate, 
and maintained at 550C for 2 hours, the dry gel decomposes 
into PLZT microfine powder. 
<H5>  2.3 Property Evaluation </H5>
  The gel apparent density and gel porosity are measured by 
the 
ethanol soaking method. The DTA and TG curves of the gel are 
measured with a PCT-1 differential thermal balance (made by 
Beijing Optical Instrument Plant). The specific surface area of 
PLZT powder is measured by the BET low temperature nitrogen 
adsorption method. The X-ray spectrum of the powder is 
determined with a Rigaku D/max-rB X-ray spectrometer made in 
Japan. The powder surface configuration is observed with a Type 
S-250Mkj scanning electron microscope (SEM). The powder particle 
diameters (D[.sub]50[/] and D[.sub]v[/]) and their 
distributions are measured with a BI-90 laser scattering 
particle analyzer made in the United States. 
<H5>  3. Results and Discussions </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Effect of pH Value on Gelling Time and Gel Structure </H5>
  The sol-gel process of metal isopropylates is generally 
believed to be a two-step reaction process, the hydrolysis and 
the polycondensation of the metal isopropylates. The speed and 
the degree of completion of both reactions are determined by 
factors such as pH values, catalysts, etc. 
  Measurement of gelling time: The gelling time is measured 
from the time when the sol reaches room temperature to the time 
when the gel solidifies to such a condition that its surface 
does not move while the container is tilted to 
45.[.sup]6[/] 
  Figure 1 shows the effect of pH value (from 2 to 9) on 
gelling time. It shows that the longest gelling time occurs when 
the pH value is between 6 and 7. When the pH value is greater 
than 7 the gelling speed increases rapidly. When the pH value is 
less than 5, the change of gelling speed is not apparent. It is 
easier to control the gelling speed by adding acidic solution. 
Besides, acidic solution also produces uniform transparent gel. 
It is difficult to control the gelling speed with a basic 
solution, which also makes the gel less transparent. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 1. Effect of pH Value on the Gelation Time&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The pH value of the solvent also clearly affects the gel 
structure as shown in Figure 2. When the pH value is low, the 
gel apparent density and gel porosity change only slightly with 
change in pH value. When the pH value is greater than 6, with 
increase in the pH value, the apparent density (Curve 1) rapidly 
decreases and the porosity rapidly increases (Curve 2). 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 2. Effect of pH Value on the Apparent Density and 
Porosity of the Gel&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The aforementioned results show that the catalytic effects 
of 
acid or base on the sol-gel process are quite different. Further 
study on the catalytic mechanism is needed. 
<H5>  3.2 Effect of Solvent on Gel Structure </H5>
  Figure 3 displays the apparent densities of gels made with 
different monohydric alcohols as solvents. It shows that when 
straight-chain monohydric alcohol is used, the dry gel apparent 
density increases with the increase of solvent surface tension. 
During gel drying, the capillary force controls the gel frame 
contraction. And the capillary force is in direct proportion 
with the surface tension of the solvent. Therefore, lower 
surface tension will produce lower contraction pressure, which 
is favorable to the forming of larger voids, resulting in lower 
apparent density. On the contrary, higher surface tension 
produces a gel with higher apparent density. However, this is 
not the case when isopropanol alcohol is used as solvent. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 3. Relationship Between Apparent Density of Gel and 
Surface Tension of Solvents Used&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Isopropanol alcohol has the lowest surface tension (21.7 x 
10[.sup]-3[/] N-m[.sup]-1[/]) but the dry gel produced by 
it does not have the lowest apparent density. This phenomenon 
indicates that the effect of solvent on gel structure is not 
simply reflected in gel apparent density. The apparent density 
is also affected by other solvent molecular properties. 
<H5>  3.3 Effect of Drying Condition on Gel Properties and the </H5>
PLZT Powder Particle Size 
  The gel samples made from the isopropanol alcohol as solvent 
with pH = 4 are dried separately under the following three 
conditions: 
  (1) dry the sample in an oven at 100C for 8 hours at a 
stretch repeatedly until there is no weight change of the gel 
sample; 
  (2) dry the sample in an oven at 50C for 12 hours at a 
stretch repeatedly until there is no weight change of the gel 
sample. After that, the oven temperature is raised to 100C, 
and then the gel is dried again according to process (1); 
  (3) dry the sample in vacuum at room temperature for 12 
hours 
at a stretch repeatedly until there is no weight change of the 
gel sample. After that, the gel sample is dried according to 
process (1). 
  Table 1 shows the qualities and apparent densities of the 
gels dried by the three different methods. It indicates that 
drying conditions greatly affect gel quality. The higher the 
temperature, the higher the drying speed, and the more inferior 
is the gel quality. During high-temperature speed-drying, the 
uneven stress from volume contraction of the gel surface and the 
gel interior causes gel cracking. At high temperature, the 
surface tension of the solvent becomes smaller and produces 
larger void volume. Consequently, the gel transparency worsens 
and the gel apparent density is reduced.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Each of the gels made by the three different drying methods 
is roasted at 550C for 2 hours to produce PLZT powder. 
Figure 4 displays the powder particle size cumulative frequency 
distribution curves. It shows that the PLZT powder made from 
gels dried in the 100C oven has the widest range of 
particle size distribution and the largest grain size, with 345 
nm as the median particle diameter D[.sub]50[/] (i.e., the 
equivalent diameter at 50 percent cumulative frequency). The 
PLZT powder made from room-temperature vacuum drying has a 
narrow range of particle diameter distribution and the smallest 
grain size, with 126 nm as D[.sub]50[/]. High-temperature 
rapid-drying increases the agglomeration tendency of gel 
particles, and hence produces PLZT powder with large 
conglomerations.

Powders With Different Drying Conditions 
&lt;annot&gt; 1. 100C; 2. 50C; 3. Room temperature&lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  3.4 Thermal Analysis of Dry Gel </H5>
  The gel dried in the 50C oven is analyzed by TG and 
DTA. 
Figure 5 shows the TG and DTA curves. The TG curve indicates 
that the gel decomposition is completed at 500C because no 
weight loss occurs after this temperature. In the DTA curve, the 
endothermic peak around 140C is caused by the evaporation 
of water and isopropanol; the exothermic peak around 350C, 
by the burning of the organic material; and the exothermic peak 
around 520C, by the formation of the PLZT solid solution. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 5. DTA and TG Curves of Gel&lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  3.5 Effect of Roasting Temperature on PLZT Powder Properties </H5>
  Based on the DTA results, the dry gel samples are divided 
into batches. Each sample batch is roasted for 2 hours within 
the temperature range 450C to 700C at an increment of 
50C or 100C. The X-ray diffraction analysis results of 
the samples after roasting are shown in Figure 6. The curves in 
Figure 6 shows that the PLZT powder from the 450C roasted 
sample has amorphous structure. A small amount of crystals 
appears in the powder from the 500C roasted sample. The 
powder from the 550C roasted sample completely crystallizes 
into a single PLZT crystal phase. The powders from samples 
roasted between 600C and 700C show no new phases but 
stronger and sharper diffraction peaks. This indicates that in 
the 600C to 700C range, the crystal particle size of 
samples increases with the increase of roasting temperature, but 
the crystal phase remains unchanged. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 6. XRD for PLZT Powder Calcined at Different 
Temperatures&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Table 2 shows the median diameters D[.sub]50[/], average 
volume diameters D[.sub]v[/], and the specific surface areas 
of powders roasted at 550C, 600C, and 700C, 
respectively. Figure 7 [photographs not reproduced] shows the 
SEM photographs of the powders. Table 2 and Figure 7 indicate 
that the particle of PLZT powder grows with increase in roasting 
temperature -- a result identical with those of the X-ray 
diffraction. These test results conclude that low-temperature 
roasting is favorable to the production of microfine PLZT 
powder. However, at PLZT solid solution does not form at too low 
a roasting temperature; hence, the optimum roasting temperature 
range is 550-600C.

<H5>  4. Conclusions </H5>
  (1) The optimum parameters for producing PLZT microfine 
powder with metal isopropylates as raw materials are: isopropyl 
alcohol as solvent, acetic acid as catalyst, pH = 3-4, 
low-temperature and low-speed drying, and roasting temperature 
within the range of 550-600C. 
  (2) Under basic condition, gel particles tend to 
agglomerate, 
and produce large-diameter PLZT particles. 
  (3) To produce PLZT microfine powder, the gel drying process 
and the gel roasting temperature must be closely controlled.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NEC Plans Software Venture in </F>
Beijing"] 
  [Text] Tokyo (Agencies via XINHUA) -- NEC Corp announced 
last week that it had reached an agreement to set up a computer 
software development venture in Beijing next month with the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences. The NEC-CAS Software Laboratories 
Ltd. will be capitalized at 150 million yen ($1.5 million), with 
NEC holding 90 percent and the Institute of Software of the 
Academia Sinica holding the remaining 10 percent. 
  NEC said the venture would start operating in July with 50 
employees, rising to 200 at a later stage. Software sales are 
targeted to climb from 60 million yen ($576,000) in the first 
year to 200 million yen ($1.92 million) by 1999. The new 
company, said to be the first software development venture in 
China, will focus on developing open-system UNIX-based 
middleware and computer-aided software engineering products for 
the Chinese market. 
  Due to the progressive development of downsizing and open 
systems in recent years, the demand for portable computers and 
workstations in China has expanded rapidly, NEC said. "There is 
a high expectation of rapid growth in the personal computer and 
workstation markets due to rapid growth in Chinese industry," it 
added.

<F P=106> [Article by Song Ning: ``GEIS Teams Up to Explore Data </F>
Networks''] 
  [Text] General Electric Information Services (GEIS) entered 
[into] a partnership agreement yesterday with the Great Wall 
Computer Group, marking a major step by the US company in 
joining the Three Golden Projects, China's colossal information 
network. GEIS, one of 12 subsidiaries of the General Electric 
Company, authorized the Great Wall to become its sales arm in 
China. The Beijing-based company, one of the largest computer 
makers in China, had been service agent for the American firm's 
China-based clients. 
  GEIS is one of the largest global suppliers of electronic 
mail (E-mail) and electronic data interchange (EDI). It has 15 
users based in China, including China National Chemicals Import 
and Export Corporation (Sinochem) and China Ocean Shipping 
Corporation (COSCO). ``By developing our cooperation with the 
Great Wall, our products can be fully adapted to local 
requirements,'' said Owen Chan, managing director of GEIS 
operations in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
  The Three Golden Projects will link China's banking and 
customs services and national information interchange through 
huge information networks. Although the project has yet to 
begin, foreign companies have been lobbying hard to get 
contracts. 
  Many of the projects are attracting overseas investors 
despite the heavy input they require. Hellene S. Runtagh, 
president of GEIS, said: ``Having an impressive local partner 
like the Great Wall will help us come to meet the Chinese 
requirements for the information highway. Competition will be 
less with such a partnership.'' She said her company hopes to 
win bids in the Golden Customs and Golden Card Projects since 
GEIS has more than 20 years of experience in handling EDI 
trading and credit card services. 
  GEIS has a joint venture in the United States with 
Ameritech, 
which has long been in the credit card sector. Quentin P. 
Gallivan, vice-president of GEIS, said he is interested in 
technology transfer with Chinese partners. ``We want to have 
the technology operating in the US brought to China and work 
with companies like the Great Wall to meet Chinese needs,'' he 
said. ``We're not only concerned with giving EDI software, we 
want to teach the Chinese how to set up an EDI service and how 
to make it successful.''

<F P=106> [Article by Gao Tao: ``Information Sector Thrives''] </F>
  [Text] China's booming telecommunications industry is 
rapidly developing a modern nationwide information network. The 
immediate task is focusing on expanding and upgrading the 
[Chinapac] packet-switched public data network to meet the 
growing demands for non-voice telecommunications across the 
country and with the world, said an official from the Ministry 
of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT). 
  The network includes two levels--the backbone network 
(primary switching centres) and regional networks in each 
province, autonomous region and municipality (secondary 
switching centres). The trunk network, containing 5,500 ports, 
has been finished and put into operation. The network includes 
696 trunk ports, two international gateways, and one gateway for 
Hong Kong and Macao. Data transmission is realized through the 
public telecommunications system, including fibre-optic cables, 
microwave and satellite communications. Through the network, 
computer owners across the country who join Chinapac can 
exchange information and contact with other computer users at 
home and abroad. 
  By the end of this year, the network will cover 500 Chinese 
cities as local telecommunications administrations are building 
14 provincial networks. Another 15 provincial networks have 
already been established. It is expected that the network will 
cover all counties in East, South and Central China and some 
counties in West China by 1995. MPT expects that the number of 
users of the network will reach 8,000 this year and grow to 
20,000 by 1995. At present, most of the users are financial 
organizations, banks, stock exchanges, large enterprises and 
government departments. The official stressed that it is 
important to constantly upgrade the network's technology and 
facilities to meet the growing demands of the customers. It is 
the trend and the plan of the ministry to link up all databases 
in the country through the network, making it possible for all 
to share the information. Methods of dividing the profits 
between databases and telecommunications departments will be 
worked out. 
  The non-voice telecommunications service sector, otherwise 
called value-added service communications, is expected to grow 
by 50 percent this year and the next. Beyond the next couple of 
years, services are charted to grow at an annual rate of 30 
percent between 1996 and 2000. With the further upgrading and 
expansion of China's public telecommunications network, more and 
more data communications will become possible, such as videotex, 
E-mail, EDI [Electronic Data Interchange] and other services. 
Videotex integrates data transmission and data processing and 
displays the information or image on a computer terminal. The 
service is now available in Shanghai and will be expanded to 
Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Beijing and other big cities. Most 
equipment for the service is imported from France and Germany 
while the rest is domestically made. It is expected that the 
number of videotex users will grow to 5,000 by the end of next 
year and to 30,000 by 2000. 
  The E-mail service provides computer networking that 
facilitates the transfer of text, messages, and other 
information among the subscribers. Six such systems have been 
installed in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Jiangmen, Shenzhen 
and Qingdao, and each allows 3,000 mailboxes. The average 
capacity of each mailbox is 100,000 bytes. In order to promote 
wide application of the system, research institutes in China 
have developed technical specifications and requirements for 
E-mail service. The wide application of E-mail will greatly 
increase the demand for the packet-switched public data network 
in China. 
  Electronic data interchange (EDI) is a system allowing 
traders to do business using electronic telecommunications 
rather than papers. It ensures rapid transactions and reduces 
human error. Several Chinese departments and ministries, such 
as telecommunications departments, the electronics industry, 
banks, foreign trade and customs, are jointly working to 
establish a national EDI system. It is planned that a 
nationwide EDI system will be formed by 2000 and connected with 
the international network. It is also believed that China will 
lose a competitive edge in foreign trade if the development of 
the EDI system is delayed. EDI systems have been adopted by 
many countries. Customs clearance among most European countries 
and the United States are done by using EDI. It was reported 
that 95 percent of foreign trade in Singapore is conducted 
through EDI. 
  The ministry plans to expand and link up all public 
telephone 
directory inquiry systems and information services databases 
across the country operated by themselves. The information 
services databases, the 168 access code on the public phone 
network, will be one of the main targets for development in the 
future. Whenever the customer needs information, if they just 
dial 168 they will get all they need.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Chen Xianfa [7115 0341 4099]: "Anhui Is </F>
Building an Energy Resource Base Area in China with a Total 
Investment of 4 Billion Yuan in New Mining Area"] 
  [Text] The Chinese Government has continually increased the 
intensity of investments during the past several years in 
Huainan City, Anhui Province, east China's "Energy Resource 
City," to reduce this region's energy resource shortages. 
  Huainan has always been known as a "motive power granary" of 
the east China region, China's most economically vigorous 
region. Since implementation of the "Chang Jiang Strategy" of 
developing Pudong [New Economic Zone in Shanghai] to spur an 
economic takeoff in the entire Chang Jiang river basin, this 
city's status has become even more prominent. 
  Huainan City has a superior quality coal field with the 
largest reserves -- the Huainan Mining region -- with projected 
reserves of 30 billion tons which include 10.8 billion tons of 
carefully surveyed reserves, equal to one-fourth of China's 
reserves that have the proper conditions for extraction. 
  Huainan is about 570 kilometers from Shanghai, China's 
economic center, and the railroads that run through the Huainan 
City region are connected to China's north-south artery, the 
Jin-Pu [Tianjin-Pudong] line, and are just a few 10 kilometers 
from the Jing-Jiu [Beijing-Kowloon] line now under construction. 
Some 200 kilometers to the south it goes through the Yuxikou 
Dedicated Coal Pier and enters the Chang Jiang channel. Thus, 
its regional location is superior. Calculations indicate that 
transporting coal from Huainan to Shanghai is 1,200 kilometers 
closer than hauling it from China's other coal base area, 
Shanxi, and that hauling 30 million newly-dug tons from Huainan 
to Shanghai could save 1.65 billion yuan in railroad shipping 
fees alone compared to transporting it from Shanxi. 
  Officials in Huainan City said that the city's total coal 
output during 1993 was about 12 million tons. Although by the 
end of this century the entire city's total coal output, 
including central unified distribution coal mines and local coal 
mines, will reach 27 million tons, it will still be unable to 
satisfy the huge demand for economic growth in east China. At 
that time, the Chang Jiang Delta region with Shanghai at its 
center will have coal shortages of 80 to 100 million tons. To 
alleviate the contradiction between supply and demand, Huainan 
has formulated a program to accelerate development in an effort 
to surpass 40 million tons in coal by 2010. The Chinese 
Government is providing focused support for this program and the 
State will invest 5.28 billion yuan in Huainan's unified 
distribution coal mines, including 2.04 billion yuan that will 
be completed during the next three years. Central authorities 
have already invested a total of 4 billion yuan in surveys, 
construction, and production in Huainan's new mining regions. 
  Huainan also holds status in China in power generating 
capacity. It currently has an installed generating capacity of 
2,300MW and generates 12.3 billion kWh of electricity annually.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Tang Dongning [3282 2639 1337]: "China </F>
Overcomes a Technical Problem in Power Grid Stability for the 
First Time with a Unique Leading Theory in International 
Applications"] 
  [Text] People have difficulty imagining what the outcome 
would be should there be a loss of stability in large power 
grids, which are so inseparable from our national economy and 
social life. Dr. Xue Yusheng [5641 4416 0524], chief engineer in 
the Ministry of Electric Power Industry's Nanjing Automation 
Institute, has created a completely new electric power system 
computation method, the Expanded Equal-Area Criterion (EEAC). 
After a year of on-line application in China, it has 
successfully achieved power grid transient state safety 
monitoring and control. This achievement is an indication that 
an acute technical problem that has troubled the world's 
electric power industry for a long time has been solved. 
  EEAC, called "Xue's Method" by international academic 
circles, was invented while Xue Yusheng was studying for his 
doctorate at Liege University in Belgium in 1986. At the time, 
it was internationally recognized that all representative 
electric power system transient state direct safety analysis 
methods were established on their own empirical assumptions and 
that they were very ill-adapted to the quick and accurate 
analytical computations required by extremely complex large 
power grids. Thus, for many years electric power S&amp;T circles 
in 
all countries have continuously striven to explore new routes. 
The EEAC direct method, the unique creation of a Chinese person, 
effectively simplifies the extremely complex stability problems 
of large electric power systems into an equal-value dual-machine 
system stability problem, and is the only rapid computation 
method in the world at present using a purely analytical mode to 
resolve electric power system stability. It has a high degree of 
precision and its actual applied speed is two numerical grades 
faster than the numerical integration methods of the past. In 
1991, the French Electric Power Company (EDF), the largest in 
the world, applied EEAC in its power grid system and operating 
program. Because of its obviously superior computation precision 
and speed, many countries are now tracking this achievement. 
  Because EEAC was still in the static stage at the end of 
1991, Dr. Xue Yusheng and a scientific research group led by 
him, further developed a dynamic state EEAC and developed a 
critical identification method. This raised the precision of 
EEAC up to a new stage and freed operating personnel from their 
a priori knowledge and took a major step toward its use in 
engineering. In China, the Nanjing Automation Institute has 
placed EEAC into formal on-line operation in the East China 
Grid's real-time energy management system. The results over the 
past year confirm that EEAC provides great assistance in 
avoiding power grid destabilization accidents. 
  At the EEAC examination and acceptance meeting held on 2 
April 1994, Ministry of Electric Power Industry minister Shi 
Dazhen [0670 1129 2923] called on power grids in all areas of 
China to extend and apply this internationally advanced 
stability computation method to raise safe and stable operation 
of China's power grids to a new level.

  [Text] Guiyang -- The central government has approved the 
construction of the Hongjiadu Hydropower Station on the Wujiang 
River, a major tributary of the Yangtze River, in Southwest 
China's Guizhou Province. The station will have a generating 
capacity of 540,000 kW. Experts calculate that the Wujiang River 
represents 8.56 million kW of potential hydroelectric capacity. 
A 630,000-kW hydropower station is now in operation and a 
510,000-kW plant will be completed within the year. In the long 
run, a Wujiang hydropower base with generating capacity of 6.39 
million kW is envisioned in the next 25 years.

China To Build Electric Power Corridor; Preferential Policies

  [Text] By the end of this century, southwest China will 
finish building an "electric power corridor," an energy resource 
development deployment to "transmit power from west to east 
China" will have basically taken shape, and China's largest 
cluster of hydropower bases will arise in southwest China. 
  This information was revealed by representatives from the 
four provinces of southwest China attending the 2d session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress. 
  He Rong [6320 2837], a Yunnan representative to the National 
People's Congress and assistant general manager of the Chang 
Jiang Three Gorges Development Corporation, said during a visit 
by Xinhua news agency reporters that southwest China is a region 
with China's most abundant hydropower resources, with 194,000MW 
of total developable and usable hydropower, equal to 57 percent 
of China's total hydropower. For a long time, this area has 
consistently been an important base area providing energy 
resources to all of China, especially the coastal regions of 
east China. 
  Representative Wang Zhaobang [3769 0340 6721], deputy chief 
engineer in the Guangxi Hydropower Engineering Bureau, told 
reporters that construction of the southwest China energy 
resource base area will mainly be focused on cascade development 
of six large river basins in the region, the Jinsha Jiang, 
Yalong Jiang, Dadu He, Lancang Jiang, Wu Jiang, and Hongshui He, 
and that a cluster of hydropower bases is now taking shape. 
  He said that 65 large hydropower stations have been planned 
for the trunks of these rivers alone with a total installed 
generating capacity of 120,000MW. This includes 11 hydropower 
stations that have already been completed or that are now under 
construction with a total installed generating capacity of 
10,810MW and annual power output of 51.92 billion kWh. 
  These two experts revealed that seven additional large 
hydropower stations with a total installed generating capacity 
of almost 20,000MW will be built there during the Ninth 5-Year 
Plan (1996-2000). 
  He Rong said that the large-scale construction of energy 
resource base areas in southwest China is an important strategic 
step being taken by the Chinese Government to deal with the loss 
of coordination in China's national energy resource structure 
and the electric power shortages of the coastal region of east 
China. Now, the Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou power grids have 
begun transmitting power from the Tianshengqiao Second Cascade 
Power Station, recently placed into operation, to Guangdong, and 
this is an initial realization of the State's long-term idea of 
an energy resource development deployment to "transmit power 
from west to east China." 
  He said that the southwest China region will use foreign 
capital to accelerate energy resource base area construction. 
The provinces of southwest China have now formulated a series of 
preferential policies to encourage foreign businesses to come to 
southwest China for joint investments in electric power 
development or independent investments to develop electric power. 
  According to the information, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, and 
Guizhou will sign more than 10 joint investment electric power 
development projects with companies from the United States, 
Thailand, and Hong Kong. Furthermore, the four provinces and 
autonomous regions of southwest China will also bring in World 
Bank and Asian Development Bank loans of more than $1 billion. 
  The experts say they expect that with more intensive reform 
and opening up, the combination of rapid development of the 
southwest China energy resource base area and the economic 
advantages of east and west China will lead to further 
developments in a substantial direction.

Made on Supply Arrangements for Three Gorges Hydropower 
Generators That Combine Solicitation of Bids From Foreign 
Countries With Domestic Cooperation"] 
  [Text] I learned on 26 March 1994 from the State Council's 
Three Gorges Project Construction Commission Office that China 
will adopt an arrangement involving solicitation of bids from 
foreign countries in conjunction with the cooperation of 
domestic enterprises to design and manufacture the large power 
generators required for the Three Gorges project. 
  According to chief engineer Li Shouren [2621 1343 0088] from 
the Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, the Three Gorges 
project will require a total of 26 large mixed flow-through 
turbine generators with unit capacities of 700MW. The water 
turbine rotors will be about 9.85 meters in diameter. They will 
be among the world's largest hydropower generators in dimensions 
and will involve relatively high design and manufacturing 
technology requirements. During the past several years, China's 
machine-building industry has done many preliminary attacks on 
key technical problems and other preparatory work to develop the 
hydropower generators for the Three Gorges project, and it now 
basically has the capability of manufacturing this type of large 
hydropower generator. 
  Taking into consideration the possibility of using foreign 
investments for the Three Gorges project, to ensure that the 
technology and quality of the generators in the Three Gorges 
project attain advanced world levels and spur further 
improvement in China's power generation equipment development 
levels, the State has decided to carry out international bid 
solicitation around 1996 to develop the 26 large hydropower 
generators needed for the Three Gorges project. The first 12 
generators will utilize a supply arrangement involving joint 
design and cooperative production by the foreign businesses that 
win the bids, Harbin Generator Plant, and the East China 
Generator Plant. The foreign businesses will have overall 
responsibility in the areas of technology, quality, delivery 
schedules, and so on, to the proprietor, the China Chang Jiang 
Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, while the 
cooperating plants on the Chinese side will be responsible to 
the foreign businesses. During the process of joint design and 
cooperative production, the Chinese manufacturing plants must 
gradually increase the proportion of their responsibility and 
gain an understanding of generator design and manufacturing 
technology. The last 14 generators will mainly be produced 
domestically with the Chinese plants assuming responsibility for 
supplying the equipment to the proprietor.

Accelerating Development of Wu Jiang's Hydropower, Nine Large 
Hydropower Stations To Be Built on the Trunk of the Wu Jiang"] 
  [Text] Construction and development of southwest China's Wu 
Jiang Hydropower Energy Resource Base Area will be further 
accelerated. The State has now approved construction of the 
Hongjiadu Hydropower Station with an installed generating 
capacity of 540MW on the trunk of the Wu Jiang. 
  This is a "spigot" station on the trunk of the Wu Jiang, an 
important tributary of the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang, as 
well as the third hydropower station being built for cascade 
development of the Wu Jiang as a whole. After its completion, it 
will play an important role in increasing power output in 
downstream cascade power stations. 
  The trunk of the Wu Jiang is a big hydropower "motherlode" 
with a developable total installed generating capacity of 
8,560MW. The State has now formally approved construction of 
nine large hydropower stations on the trunk of the Wu Jiang. 
Wujiangdu Hydropower Station, with an installed generating 
capacity of 630MW, has been completed and is generating power, 
and construction of the Dongfeng Power Station with an installed 
generating capacity of 510MW will be completed in 1994 and will 
be placed into operation. China plans to complete the Wujiang 
Hydropower Energy Resource Base Area with a total installed 
generating capacity of 6,390MW and annual power output of up to 
40 billion kWh within the next 25 years. 
  The Wu Jiang river basin is one of 19 key development zones 
proposed in China's overall territorial development program. The 
largest coal mine base area south of the Chang Jiang, it has a 
full complement of coal varieties and 30.8 billion tons of 
reserves. The river basin also has abundant aluminum, 
phosphorous, manganese, mercury, and other mineral resources, 
including 207 million tons of bauxite, and comes in third place 
for resources in China. It has 2.58 million tons of phosphorous 
ore reserves, which holds second place in China, and it holds 
first place in China in superior-quality phosphorous ore 
reserves. 
  Experts feel that these resource advantages form a rather 
good group of matching configurations and give it comprehensive 
advantages for developing the high energy-consuming raw 
materials industry.

<F P=106> [Excerpts from article by Vice Minister of Coal Industry, </F>
Han Ying [7281 5391]: "On the Situation in Plan Execution in 
1993 and Plan Arrangements for 1994"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  II. Plan Arrangements for 1994 </H5>
  In 1994, State plans arrange for expected raw coal output of 
1.16 billion tons, an increase of 20 million tons over 1993. 
This includes 480 million tons at State-owned key coal mines, a 
reduction of 27 million tons; 195 million tons at State-owned 
local coal mines, basically the same as in 1993; and 485 million 
tons at township and town coal mines, an increase of 13 million 
tons. The total output plan for 1994 is a projected plan and 
does not check the total output execution situation. 
  In 1994, the total amount commodity coal resources turned 
over to the State for allocation was still 552.24 million tons. 
This includes 479.98 million tons in State orders and 72.26 
million tons in resources that were changed from State orders to 
regional orders, concentrated in northwest China, southwest 
China, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and other regions, with the 
remaining resources going through provincial orders and 
enterprises doing their own selling on the market. The problem 
reflected in coal orders in 1994 was once again that supplies of 
coal exceeded demand, and in particular there were surpluses of 
anthracite mixed pulverized coal and some varieties of dressed 
coal for smelting. 
  During the process of executing production plans in 1994, we 
must be concerned about the following problems: 1) The State 
only implements macro regulation and control and an overall 
balance. Many rights have been transferred down to 
province-level administrative departments and enterprises, and 
we must certainly do our jobs and assume our responsibilities. 
We cannot let things slide because of the emphasis on macro 
management and create a situation in which things have no one 
managing them and nothing is being managed; 2) We must certainly 
establish the concept of the market economy, solidly grasp the 
focus on economic results, arrange plans on the basis of market 
demand conditions and selling and transportation conditions, and 
organize production and administrative activities; 3) Production 
plan management arrangements and management measures have 
changed, but mining bureaus and province-level administrative 
departments must have an idea of what their mine production 
situations are, how their economic results are, and which mines 
should increase their output and which should restrict their 
output or cease production, and they should adopt active 
measures for additional guidance. Although production plans have 
not been checked, enterprise production plans and province 
(autonomous region) production plans should all be reported to 
higher authorities on schedule and according to stipulations to 
enable us to gain information and carry out industry management 
and macro regulation and control. I ask that comprehensive 
planning departments at all levels focus well on this item of 
work in accordance with this requirement. 
  In the area of technical upgrading, plan arrangements are 
for 
883 million yuan to be invested in technical upgrading in the 
coal industry during 1994, which will include 200 million yuan 
in central government financial allocations, 513 million yuan in 
bank loans, and 170 million yuan in self-raised capital for 
projects receiving bank loans. The implementation of our 
technical upgrading plans for 1994 requires that we 
conscientiously focus on work in the following items: 1) Focus 
on providing the capital. Investments in technical upgrading 
during 1994 overall involve two forms. One is composed of State 
allocations and self-raised capital. The other is composed of 
bank loans and self-raised capital. To provide these funds, we 
must do a great deal of coordination and linking work 
everywhere. Planning departments at all levels must 
conscientiously do this work well and report the situation in 
funding implementation and plan execution to the Ministry of 
Coal Industry; 2) We must focus on work to implement technical 
upgrading projects, ensure project quality and progress, and 
make technical upgrading projects produce investment benefits as 
quickly as possible. 
  In the area of capital construction, the scale of 
investments 
arranged for coal in 1994 by the central government is 15.29 
billion yuan, an increase of 20 million yuan over plans at the 
beginning of 1993. This includes 4,247,300,000 yuan in domestic 
budget investments, 8,654,700,000 yuan in construction bank 
loans, 400 million yuan in special funds, 1.381 billion yuan in 
foreign investments, 237 million yuan in investments to shift 
from oil to coal, 270 million yuan in self-raising indicators, 
and 100 million yuan in small-scale capital construction 
investments in local coal mines. The main problems in 
arrangements for investments in capital construction in the coal 
industry are: 1) Limited investments, an increase of just 20 
million yuan compared to 1993; 2) The 15.29 billion yuan in 
investments still arranges for a 400 million yuan development 
fund, but after coal prices are deregulated there will be no way 
that this money can be obtained by users outside the calculated 
prices. We have proposed to the State that it be changed into 
other categories of investments; 3) There is 3.16 billion yuan 
in capital construction bonds that will reach maturity and 
should be repaid in 1994. We have arranged to repay 210 million 
yuan in capital construction investments during the year, but 
the remaining 2.95 billion yuan (bonds and construction loan 
interest and principal) has not been dealt with. Preliminary 
arrangements have been made for a scale of capital construction 
of mines in the coal industry at 89 locations with 137.14 
million tons, including 18 mines that will be placed into 
production with 31.99 million tons, 64 mines where construction 
will continue with 93.6 million tons, seven mines where 
construction will start with 11.55 million tons, and 18 mines 
where preparations for construction will be made with 68 million 
tons. There are five mines with poor results that will cease 
construction, with 3.09 million tons. 
  After consultations with the State Council and investment 
companies, the principles for arranging for investments in the 
coal industry in 1994 are: make key arrangements for those 
projects that will have good administrative results after going 
into production, can repay loans, and have good external 
transportation conditions; make normal arrangements for those 
projects which will have relatively good results after going 
into production but which will be unable to repay the loans and 
which have external transportation conditions; straighten out 
those projects which would have poor administrative results 
after going into production, experience losses, be unable to 
repay loans, and have poor external transportation conditions, 
and cease building those where construction should be stopped. 
In addition, readjust the investment structure, increase 
investments as appropriate in railroads, power plants, cement 
plants, and other projects with benefits. In 1994, a total 
investment of 1.996 billion yuan has been arranged for cement 
plants, power plants, and railroads, an increase of 555 million 
yuan over 1993. The ratio between mines and matching facilities 
in yearly capital construction investments in the past was 
consistently 67:33, but it will reach 58:42 in 1994. There is a 
significant increase in investments in benefits projects. 
  Rather substantial changes will occur in coal investment 
channels in 1994. In particular, construction bank loans will 
account for more than half the total investments, which is an 
increase of 1.9 billion yuan over 1993. All units should, in 
accordance with previously arranged construction projects, focus 
closely on linking together with management of construction 
banks and conduct evaluation work for new construction loan 
projects as quickly as possible to ensure that the loans are 
used according to schedule. 
  1994 is the year of the State's greatest reform efforts and 
a 
key year for completing the Eighth 5-Year Plan. The coal capital 
construction tasks are extremely heavy. The scale of mines (and 
strip mines) which we plan to place into production in 1994 is 
the greatest in one year during the past several years, and we 
should start focusing on this item of work from the beginning of 
the year and provide preferential guarantees for provision of 
the construction capital, the supplies of equipment and 
materials, and the construction staff arrangements required for 
these projects. All areas must work together to cooperate and 
ensure that tasks to place projects into operation during 1994 
are completed. For those key mines where construction will 
continue, coal washing plants, and other matching productive 
projects, we must focus on those key projects which concern 
construction schedules and provide overall benefits and make 
preferential arrangements. For regular projects where 
construction will be continuing, we must follow the previously 
arranged investment indices and take into consideration price 
increase factors, arrange for unit projects according to how 
much we have to invest, and not leave investment shortages.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Chen Jinjun [7115 6651 6511]: "Jiangsu </F>
Discovers 10 Million-Ton Grade Oil Field"] 
  [Text] The Jiangsu Petroleum Exploration Bureau discovered 
an oil field with 10 million tons of reserves on 25 March 1994, 
the Cuizhuang oil field. 
  This oil field is located in the Jinhu depression area of 
northern Jiangsu. This is the second large oil field the Jiangsu 
Petroleum Exploration Bureau has found in the 19 years since it 
was established, following the discovery of Zhenwu oil field. 
  The Jiangsu Petroleum Exploration Bureau began exploring the 
Cuizhuang region in 1976. In 1993, after completing a 
development economics assessment of this oil region and 
discussing a development program, the bureau transferred and 
concentrated its forces to undertake development battle work. It 
has been projected that a yearly production capacity of 100,000 
tons of crude oil may be formed by October 1994. 
  The discovery of Cuizhuang oil field once again illustrates 
the great prospects for oil and gas exploration in Jiangsu. 
After this oil field is completed and placed into production, 
the Jiangsu Petroleum Exploration Bureau's annual petroleum 
production capacity will surpass 1 million tons. This will play 
an important role in alleviating the Jiangsu region's energy 
shortages and spurring the development of Jiangsu's economy, 
especially the northern Jiangsu region.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Zeng Kun [2582 0981]: "Tarim Oil Field </F>
Begins Promoting Development of Bayangol, Formerly Little-Known, 
It Is Now World Famous"] 
  [Text] Now being developed by Tarim oil field, the formerly 
little-known Xinjiang's Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture 
has in one fell swoop become a hot area in China's economic 
development now and is attracting world attention. 
  Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, located in 
southeastern Xinjiang, covers an area of 483,000 square 
kilometers. Over one-half of China's large petroliferous basin, 
the Tarim Basin, lies within Bayangol Mongol Autonomous 
Prefecture. In early April 1989, the China Petroleum and Natural 
Gas Corporation established the Tarim Petroleum Exploration and 
Development Headquarters at Korla City, which subsequently 
opened a major petroleum exploration and development effort 
involving over 20,000 petroleum employees. In the past five 
years, they have proven six ready oil and gas fields at Lunnan, 
Donghetang, Sangtam, Jirak, Jiefang [Liberation] Canal East, and 
Central Tarim No. 4, and they have discovered 25 new industrial 
oil and gas-bearing structures. During the Eighth 5-Year Plan, 
they implemented reserve resources sufficient to build a 
production capacity of 5 million tons. This is especially true 
of the discovery of the Central Tarim No. 4 100-million-ton oil 
field, which has revealed the broad prospects for finding a 
cluster of huge oil fields in the central Tarim region. Now, the 
five oil fields at Lunnan, Donghetang, Sangtam, Jiefang Canal 
East, and Central Tarim Number 4 have formed a yearly crude oil 
production capacity of 2.1 million tons, and they have produced 
a total of 2.93 million tons over the past five years with a 
daily output level of 6,000 tons. 
  Oil field development has made Bayangol Mongol Autonomous 
Prefecture the most direct beneficiary. According to statistics, 
during the past five years of oil field development the oil 
field headquarters has made direct investments of more than 1 
billion yuan in Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture as well as 
indirect investments in establishing the materials supplies, 
communication and transportation, equipment maintenance, 
machinery processing, construction materials and chemical 
industry, design and construction, labor services, and other 
areas to support the oil field that totalled several billion 
yuan. Petroleum development has spurred rapid development of 
Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture's economy. During the past 
five years, Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture's GNP has 
doubled, its gross value of industrial and agricultural output 
has increased two-fold, and its financial income has increased 
1.5-fold. Enormous changes have occurred in the autonomous 
prefecture's communication, urban construction, posts and 
telecommunication, energy resources, and other basic facilities 
and it has become one of the few regions in Xinjiang with fully 
equipped highways, railroads, pipelines, aviation, and 
telecommunications.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Gao Xinghua [7559 5281 5478]: "China's </F>
First Quarter Onshore Crude Oil Output Surpasses 34 Million 
Tons"] 
  [Text] China's onshore petroleum production situation 
during the first quarter of 1994 was excellent, with total crude 
oil output exceeding 34 million tons and 24.7 percent of the 
annual plan being completed, up slightly over the same period 
during 1993. 
  An official in the China Petroleum and Natural Gas 
Corporation said the situation was "better than expected" and 
that this was mainly due to the oil fields of eastern China 
achieving stable production and to substantial increases in 
crude oil output in western China. Evidently, the strategy for 
achieving stability in the oil fields of eastern China is based 
on focusing on increasing output as quickly as possible, 
overcoming difficulties, and maintaining a steady output from 
the end of 1993. Crude oil output in western China was up by 
13.2 percent compared to the same period in 1993. 
  Total natural gas output during the first quarter was more 
than 3.9 billion cubic meters, equal to 25.4 percent of the 
annual plan and 104.5 percent of the same period in 1993. 
  During 1994 China expects to produce onshore 140 million 
tons 
of crude oil and 16 billion cubic meters of natural gas. 
Analysis by officials in the China Petroleum and Natural Gas 
Corporation indicates that these goals can be attained if we 
sustain the production momentum of the first quarter.

  [Text] Recently improved conditions ensure that large 
petroleum resources in the inland provinces of Shaanxi and 
Sichuan will be developed quickly, according to a senior 
petroleum official. 
  Highlighting the development are operations in the northern 
part of Shaanxi Province, where blocks totaling 40,000 square 
kilometres contain an estimated 1 billion tons of oil. 
  Preparations for development in Sichuan Province have also 
been progressing, according to executives with the China 
National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), which oversees on-shore oil 
operations. 
  In an interview, a senior official with the CNPC specified 
the improved conditions in northern Shaanxi: 


    -  Better relations between State-chartered oil firms and 
regional operators. The relations necessary for quick 
development were cemented by an agreement signed early this 
month by CNPC and provincial authorities. The agreement binds 
the CNPC and governments and enterprises in the province to join 
together to accelerate oil development. They will also 
co-operate to beef up protection of oil resources. Before long, 
the official said, millions of tons of oil are expected to be 
produced in the region each year. A large portion of the output 
is to be pumped by joint operations involving the CNPC, regional 
authorities and enterprises. 
  -  The availability of technology for 
developing oil there. Petroleum development started in the 
330,000-square-kilometre Shaan-Gan-Ning Basin 90 years ago, but 
only 2 percent of the resources has been recovered because of 
inadequate technology. 
  -  Enough evidence of easy drilling for oil 
lies only 500 to 1,500 metres underground, compared with several 
times that depth elsewhere in the country. 


    With the newly signed agreement, the CNPC official said, 
long-awaited large oilfields will be built in the area before 
long. 
  Over the past 18 months, hundreds of work units have rushed 
to drill wells there to extract oil that legally belongs to the 
State. These work units, inexperienced in oil operations, sought 
quick profits and had no long-term commitment to protecting the 
resources. 
  Their operations were inefficient and hindered overall 
planning, the official said.

<F P=106> [Article: "Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant's No. 2 Generator </F>
Achieves First Full-Power Operation on 25 March"] 
  [Text] Since being in a nuclear power generating state and 
starting to conduct a power generation experiment on 7 February 
1994, in strict accordance with the debugging program and the 
requirements of technical regulations, and under the supervision 
of the National Nuclear Safety Administration and through the 
joint efforts of all the units participating in the experiment, 
the No. 2 900MW nuclear power generator at Guangdong's Daya Bay 
Nuclear Power Plant completed readjustment experiments in 
sequence at 15 percent, 30 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent, 87 
percent, and 97 percent of its rated power safely, with high 
quality, and on schedule. Comprehensive inspection, 
readjustment, and checking of the generator's equipment and 
system states led to the generator's performance in every phase 
attaining its design requirements. At 1915 hours on 25 March 
1994, the No. 2 generator attained full power for the first time. 
  During the process of debugging operations, the Guangdong 
Electric Power Industry Corporation, Hong Kong's Zhonghua 
Electric Power Company, and Guangzhou Pumped-Storage Power Plant 
provided substantial support and coordination. This was 
especially true of the Guangdong Power Grid and the Hong Kong 
Zhonghua Electric Power Company's Jiulong [Kowloon] Power Grid, 
which, under the difficult conditions of a valley in electric 
power demand during the spring season, carefully arranged for 
the grid connection plan and guaranteed that the debugging of 
the No. 2 generator proceeded smoothly. 
  According to the original debugging plan, the No. 2 
generator 
will continue operating in a full-power state and, after 
undergoing all types of performance tests, demonstration 
operation, and maintenance work, will be placed into commercial 
operation.

"Unirradiated Fast Reactor (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] Fuel Dissolution 
Experiments"; manuscript received 20 August 1993, revised 
manuscript received 15 October 1993] 
  [Text] The dissolution behavior of unirradiated 
UO[.sub]2[/] and (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] fuel in nitric acid is 
studied. Detailed descriptions of the effects of nitric acid 
concentration, temperature, pellet processing methods, 
PuO[.sub]2[/] content, and other factors on dissolution rates 
are provided and plutonium valence state changes and undissolved 
residue contents during the dissolution process are 
measured. 
  It is common knowledge that complete dissolution of 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] is required to ensure recovery of the 
plutonium in the fuel reprocessing process and prevent 
criticality accidents. Thus, fast reactor fuel dissolution 
experiments are very important for improving and evaluating fuel 
pellet fabrication techniques and designing fuel reprocessing 
flow processes. 
  Much research has been done in foreign countries on 
dissolution of fast reactor mixed oxide fuel elements in nitric 
acid[.sup][1-5][/]. The results show that the dissolution 
rate of fuel pellets is related to many factors. China's fast 
reactor research work is just beginning and the first batch of 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] fuel pellets that we developed are limited 
in number and have not been placed in the reactor and 
irradiated. Thus, to obtain data on Chinese-made fast reactor 
mixed oxide fuel dissolution as quickly as possible, we only 
studied the more important variables such as nitric acid 
concentration, temperature, pellet processing methods, 
PuO[.sub]2[/] content, and so on. 
  The research work was divided into two stages. First, we 
used 
UO[.sub]2[/] to conduct simulated fast reactor fuel 
dissolution experiments in the China Atomic Energy Scientific 
Research Academy and, after gaining some experience, we carried 
out dissolution of unirradiated (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets at 
the Lanzhou Nuclear Fuel Plant. The results of the experiments 
show that the first batch of (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] fuel pellets 
developed in China had excellent dissolution properties and that 
their dissolution rate and undissolved residues could satisfy 
reprocessing requirements.

<H5>  B. Dissolution equipment </H5>
  The dissolver is a three-necked flask fitted with a 
condensing tube and thermometer that uses a 
temperature-regulated kettle-type electric furnace to control 
the dissolution temperature. 
<H5>  C. Experimental Method </H5>
  Into the dissolver we added 50 ml (360 ml was added for the 
UO[.sub]2[/] pellets) of HNO[.sub]3[/] or 
HNO[.sub]3[/]-HF solution at a specific concentration. After 
preheating to the experimental temperature, we placed one 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellet into the loading port and dissolved 
it. At different times, we removed 0.1 ml of the dissolved 
liquid (1 ml was removed for the UO[.sub]2[/] pellets) and 
measured the uranium and plutonium concentrations and plutonium 
valence states. Usually, the pellets were dissolved for 5 hours 
and then filtered out of the dissolved liquid. After using 
dilute acid to wash the undissolved residues and filter paper, 
we placed them in a magnetic crucible and incinerated them for 1 
hour in a muffle furnace (600C), after which we weighed the 
undissolved residues in a 1:10,000 balance. We boiled and 
dissolved the residues in 50 ml of 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/]-0.05 mol/l HF for 1 hour, anaylzed the uranium 
and plutonium in the residue solution, calculated the 
uranium/plutonium ratio, and measured the amount of the residues 
using the symmetrical weight method. 
  The dissolution experiments on the UO[.sub]2[/] and 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets were carried out, respectively, in 
a common radiation chemistry laboratory and a special glove box 
in the reprocessing plant, and all analysis of the 
plutonium-bearing samples was conducted in the glove box. 
  Unless otherwise indicated, in the coprecipitated pellets 
used in the experiments, the pellets had a PuO[.sub]2[/] 
content of 27 percent, the dissolution acidity was 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/], and the temperature was the boiling point (BP). 
<H5>  D. Analytical methods </H5>
  1. Uranium: measured directly using spectrophotometry (415 
nm). When the uranium contained plutonium, it was measured using 
Br-PADAP spectrophotometry[.sup][6][/]. 
  2. Plutonium: measured using the 17 keV X-ray measurement 
method[.sup][7][/]. 
  3. Pu(IV) and Pu(VI): measured using the TTA or PMBP 
extraction method[.sup][8][/]. 
<H5>  II. Results and Discussion </H5>
<H5>  A. UO </H5>[.sub]2[/] Fuel Pellet Dissolution 
  1. Dissolution curve. Figure 1 shows the dissolution curve 
of 
the UO[.sub]2[/] pellets. The curve starts out relatively 
flat and then rises quickly, after which it again flattens and 
gradually reaches the end point of dissolution. A dissolution 
curve with this shape can be interpreted using changes in the 
effective surface area during the dissolution process. There was 
a large amount of excess nitric acid in the experiments and the 
acidity and other conditions basically did not change during the 
experiments, so the dissolution rate (mg/cm[.sup]2[/]) can be 
considered constant. Because there is a positive ratio between 
the amount of pellet dissolution per unit of time and the 
effective dissolution surface area and because the initial 
surface (processed surface) of the pellet at the start of 
dissolution is relatively smooth and the effective surface area 
is smaller, the amount of dissolution is also smaller. As 
dissolution continued, the surface of the pellet became 
increasingly rougher and the effective surface area also 
continued to increase. According to estimates by 
Uriarte[.sup][2][/], the surface roughness at 50 percent 
dissolution of the uranium pellet is increased three- to 
five-fold, and as a result there is a sharp increase in the 
amount of dissolution. As the remaining pellet becomes 
increasingly smaller, its surface area is also gradually reduced 
so that the amount of dissolution becomes smaller as a result 
until the end point of dissolution. Actually, measurement of the 
effective surface area during the dissolution process is very 
difficult, so Uriarte used the concept of a Roughness Constant 
(RC) to do a quantitative description of changes in the surface 
of the pellets during the dissolution process that is computed 
using the formula below: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 


  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  R[.sub]0[/], R[.sub]k[/], and R[.sub]n[/] are, 
respectively, the radius of the pellet at the instant when 
dissolution begins, in the middle, and at the final instant, and 
RF is the roughness factor. It can be derived by dividing the 
amount of pellet that is dissolved per unit of time by the 
amount that should be dissolved to maintain the surface 
smoothness and the constant dissolution rate. 
  2. Effects of nitric acid concentration. The UO[.sub]2[/] 
can undergo the following types of reactions when being 
dissolved in nitric acid[.sup][4][/]: 
  UO[.sub]2[/] + 4HNO[.sub]3[/] 
UO[.sub]2[/](NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/] + 2NO[.sub]2[/] 
+ 2H[.sub]2[/]O 
  UO[.sub]2[/] + 8/3HNO[.sub]3[/] 
UO[.sub]2[/](NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/] + 
2/3NO[.sub]2[/] + 4/3H[.sub]2[/]O 
  UO[.sub]2[/] + 3HNO[.sub]3[/] 
UO[.sub]2[/](NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/] + 1/2NO + 
1/2NO[.sub]2[/] + 3/2H[.sub]2[/]O 
  Like the dissolution of metallic uranium, there is no common 
chemical reaction that can completely represent the actual 
dissolution process. In the experiments we compared the 
dissolution of the UO[.sub]2[/] pellets in 12 mol/l, 8 mol/l, 
and 4 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]. The results indicate that as the 
acidity is reduced the dissolution rate drops quickly (Figure 
1). In dissolution for three hours at 4 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/], 
the amount of dissolution was only about 15 percent. 
  3. Effects of temperature. Dissolution experiments were 
conducted at different temperatures. The results show that the 
dissolution rate at 100C is slightly lower than the 
dissolution rate below the boiling point (Figure 2). 
Nevertheless, because the dissolution was steady at 100C, 
it still has substantial attractiveness for use in industrial 
production. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  B. (U,Pu)O </H5>[.sub]2[/] fuel pellet dissolution 
  1. Dissolution curve. Figure 3 shows a typical 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellet dissolution curve. Like the 
UO[.sub]2[/] pellets, the curve is flat for a period of time 
as dissolution starts and then becomes significantly steeper 
until it eventually re-flattens and reaches the dissolution end 
point. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  2. Effects of nitric acid concentration. The dissolution 
rate 
of the (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets depends significantly on the 
dissolution acidity (Figure 3). For example, in dissolution for 
three hours in 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/], the amount of pellet 
dissolution is greater than 95 percent, but is just 30 percent 
in 4 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]. 
  3. Effects of temperature. In a dissolution situation 
similar 
to that of the UO[.sub]2[/] pellets, there is also a 
corresponding reduction in the dissolution rate of the 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets as the dissolution temperature is 
reduced from the boiling point to 100C (Figure 4). This 
result is consistent with the result in article [4]. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  4. Effects of hydrofluoric acid. Just as was pointed out in 
many articles, adding 0.05 mol/l of HF to the nitric acid can 
significantly increase the dissolution rate of the 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets. The results of our experiments 
(Figure 5) show that in the initial stage of dissolution, the 
addition of HF significantly accelerates pellet dissolution. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  5. Effects of pellet processing methods. The effects of 
pellet processing methods on the dissolution rate of the 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets are shown in Figure 6. One can see 
in Figure 6 that the mechanically blended pellets have a faster 
dissolution rate than the coprecipitated pellets. This 
experimental result is consistent with article [2], but 
contradicts the data in article [1]. The cause of this situation 
could be related to different pellet sources and processing 
parameters. In our experiments, we discovered that the sintered 
density of the mechanically blended pellets was relatively low 
and that they had a loose structure, so that when being boiled 
in 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/] they fractured very quickly into a 
heap of powder, which obviously would help accelerate 
dissolution. However, this situation occurred in the 
coprecipitated pellets only after most of the pellets had been 
dissolved. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  6. Effects of PuO[.sub]2[/] content. The effect of the 
PuO[.sub]2[/] content in the (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets on 
the dissolution rate is shown in Figure 7. One can see in Figure 
7 that the higher the PuO[.sub]2[/] content, the slower the 
rate of dissolution. Koch[.sup][9][/] feels that in actual 
use, to maintain a reasonable dissolution rate, the 
PuO[.sub]2[/] content should be less than 40 percent. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  7. Undissolved residues. After the pellets had been 
dissolved 
for five hours, the solution still contained a small amount of 
undissolved residues. Their content varied according to pellet 
processing method, batch number, and dissolution conditions. It 
was 0.03 to 0.5 percent for the coprecipitated pellets and 0.3 
to 1.6 percent for the mechanically blended pellets (Table 2). 
This data is basically identical to that reported in article [1].

  Observed under the microscope, the particles of the 
undissolved residues are very small, usually smaller than 1 
m 
to 10 m. Figure 8 is a photograph of the particles of the 
undissolved residues. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Chemical analysis shows that the plutonium content of the 
undissolved residues significantly exceeds the initial plutonium 
content of the pellets. For example, the initial 
m[.sub]U[/]/m[.sub]Pu[/] was 2.7 in the 27 percent 
PuO[.sub]2[/]-UO[.sub]2[/] pellets, but after dissolution 
for five hours in boiling 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/] the 
m[.sub]U[/]/m[.sub]Pu[/] in the residue dropped to about 
0.5. The undissolved residues were very easily dissolved in 12 
mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]-0.05 mol/l HF. 
  8. Uranium optimum solution phenomenon. When 
Lerch[.sup][1][/] used boiling 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/] to 
dissolve mechanically blended (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets, he 
discovered that the dissolution rate of UO[.sub]2[/] was 
significantly faster than the dissolution rate of 
PuO[.sub]2[/]. We also discovered this type of "uranium 
optimum solution" phenomenon in our experiments on dissolution 
of mechanically blended pellets, but this type of phenomenon did 
not appear in the coprecipitated pellets (Figure 9). A possible 
interpretation is that the mechanically blended pellets have a 
loose texture and break down in the initial period of 
dissolution into a powdered form. Everyone knows that the 
dissolution rate of UO[.sub]2[/] in concentrated nitric acid 
is faster than that of PuO[.sub]2[/], so the dissolution 
curve of UO[.sub]2[/] appears above that of PuO[.sub]2[/]. 
For the coprecipitated pellets, dissolution basically occurs on 
the surface of the pellets while the pellet surface causes 
uranium optimum solution to occur, which does not have too great 
of an effect on the UO[.sub]2[/] dissolution curve and does 
not lead to the occurrence of "separation" phenomena in the 
UO[.sub]2[/] and PuO[.sub]2[/] dissolution curves. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  9. Acid consumption. The experiments were conducted in 
conditions of a large excess of nitric acid. Analysis of the 
acidity at the end point of dissolution shows that in the 12 
mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/] boiling dissolution coprecipitated pellet 
experiments, 1 mol of (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] consumed 6 mol of 
nitric acid. Because of condensation efficiency differences in 
the condensing tubes and the escape of part of the nitric acid 
vapor from the sampling port due to frequent sampling, the 
actual acid consumption used for dissolution of the pellets 
would be lower than this value. 
  10. Plutonium valence states. The valence states of the 
plutonium in the fuel pellet solution constitute an important 
reference value for subsequent value readjustment steps. In a 
situation of concentrated nitric acid boiling dissolution, 
Pu(III) cannot exist, so we only tracked and analyzed Pu(IV) and 
Pu(VI). The results show that the plutonium in the solution 
exists primarily as Pu(IV) while the Pu(VI) content varies 
depending on the pellet processing methods and dissolution 
conditions (Table 3). Overall, there are these regularities: 1) 
As the dissolution time increases, there is a tendency for the 
Pu(VI) content to increase; 2) At low dissolution temperatures, 
the Pu(VI) content is also low; 3) The Pu(VI) content in the 
mechanically blended pellets is higher than in the 
coprecipitated pellets.

<H5>  III. Conclusion </H5>
  1. With some exceptions, the pellets in the research 
dissolved easily in boiling 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]. 
  2. When the dissolution acidity was reduced from 12 mol/l to 
4 mol/l, there was a significant reduction in the dissolution 
rate of the UO[.sub]2[/] and (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets. 
  3. Below the boiling point, the dissolution rate of the 
UO[.sub]2[/] and (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets in 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/] was faster than at 100C. 
  4. The dissolution rate of the 27 percent 
PuO[.sub]2[/]-UO[.sub]2[/] pellets in boiling 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/] was faster than the 35 percent 
PuO[.sub]2[/]-UO[.sub]2[/] pellets. 
  5. Under the experimental conditions, the dissolution rate 
of 
the mechanically blended pellets was slightly faster than the 
dissolution rate of the coprecipitated pellets. 
  6. In the dissolution experiments on the mechanically 
blended 
pellets, a uranium optimum solution phenomenon was observed. 
  7. When the 27 percent PuO[.sub]2[/]-UO[.sub]2[/] 
pellets were dissolved for five hours in boiling 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/], the solution retained a small amount of 
undissolved residues. The content was 0.1 to 0.5 percent for the 
coprecipitated pellets and 0.3 to 1.6 percent for the 
mechanically blended pellets. 
  8. All of the (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets and the 
undissolved residues in the experiments dissolved easily in 
boiling 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]-0.05 mol/l HF. 
  9. The plutonium in the solution exists mainly as Pu(IV) 
while the Pu(VI) content varies with pellet processing methods 
and dissolution conditions and increases as the dissolution time 
is increased. Dissolved for five hours in boiling 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/], the Pu(VI) content can reach 30 percent.

Successfully Develops "O"-Shaped Sealing Rings for Pressure 
Vessels"] 
  [Text] Success has now been achieved in Sichuan in the 
reactor "O"-shaped sealing rings developed by the China Nuclear 
Power Academy. This is another breakthrough in research for 
shifting to domestic production of nuclear power equipment that 
follows China's successful development of nuclear power plant 
pressure vessel steel, no-leak safety valves, dual-channel 
neutron boron tables, and other achievements in our shift to 
domestic production of nuclear power plant equipment and it has 
major significance for China's achievement of a shift to 
domestic production of nuclear power equipment. 
  The "O"-shaped sealing rings for reactor pressure vessels 
are 
one of the key components to ensure safe reactor operation. The 
difficulty of their development lies in the need for the sealing 
rings to ensure that no nuclear leaks occur under conditions of 
high-temperature and high-pressure intense irradiation, which 
places rather high requirements on their materials and 
technology. The S&amp;T personnel of the China Nuclear Power 
Academy 
employed thick-walled tube casing and thick-walled spherical 
casing theory and used non-continuous analysis methods and 
iterative algorithms to successfully analyze the flange seal 
performance problems of reactor pressure vessels. Because they 
considered the coupling action of bolts, temperature, friction, 
and other areas, they achieved innovations and developments. 
  The "O"-shaped sealing rings can be widely used as pressure 
vessel seals in nuclear power plants, reactors, and other power 
reactors such as nuclear submarine reactors, and they can be 
used as high-temperature and high-pressure vessel seals in the 
petrochemical and chemical industries, thermal power plants, and 
so on.

Becomes Nuclear Power Equipment Manufacturing Base, Successive 
Power Generation at Qinshan and Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plants 
Shows China's Nuclear Power Industry Has Entered a New 
Development Phase"] 
  [Text] I learned from the Shanghai Municipality Nuclear 
Society's Special Nuclear Power Equipment Commission established 
on 8 April 1994 that successive connection to the grid and power 
generation at Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant and Daya Bay Nuclear 
Power Plant are indications that China's nuclear power industry 
has entered a new development phase. Now, Shanghai's power plant 
industry, which was involved in manufacturing the equipment for 
both nuclear power plants, has signed a technical agreement to 
manufacture the equipment for two 600MW nuclear power plants for 
the second phase at Qinshan, and the manufacturing contract for 
part of the equipment for the 300MW nuclear power plant to be 
exported to Pakistan has also been signed, making Shanghai 
China's nuclear power equipment manufacturing base area. 
Shanghai Municipality Deputy Mayor Zhao Qizheng [6392 0796 2973] 
attended the meeting and gave a speech. 
  Shanghai has already invested nearly 200 million yuan to 
develop our nuclear power industry and it has completed several 
nuclear power technical measures capital construction projects 
on a substantial scale with a total structural area of 93,000 
square meters, including seven 100- to 400-ton plant buildings. 
The Shanghai Municipal Government has also included nuclear 
power as one of Shanghai Municipality's 14 projects to attack 
key problems in integrating S&amp;T with production. Since 
starting 
in 1988, Shanghai Municipality's financial administration has 
issued over 13 million yuan in loans to support attacks on key 
S&amp;T problems in nuclear power projects, and by the end of 
1993 
it had established 88 topics, 62 of which had passed examination 
and acceptance. At the same time, with support from the relevant 
ministries, commissions, and offices of the State Council, 11 of 
the topics among the State's projects to attack key problems 
related to 600MW nuclear power projects during the Eighth 5-Year 
Plan have been assigned to Shanghai Municipality and it has 
allocated more than 12 million yuan in funds to spur Shanghai to 
improve its nuclear power equipment manufacturing capabilities. 
  To ensure that the tasks for the Qinshan second-phase 
nuclear 
power project and the Pakistan nuclear power project are 
completed, Shanghai has decided to invest an additional 200 
million yuan-plus in capital during the Eighth 5-Year Plan for 
technical upgrading to fill in and supplement the more than 20 
plants that will assume responsibility for nuclear power tasks, 
and the municipality plans to gradually form an annual 
production capacity to produce 1 to 1.5 sets of nuclear power 
equipment during the Ninth 5-Year Plan.

  [Excerpts] Hong Kong, 18 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- 
Since Zhejiang's Qinshan nuclear power plant and Guangdong's 
Daya Bay nuclear power plant went into operation, the Beijing 
authorities have started preparations for more nuclear plants to 
be built across the country by the end of this century and early 
next century so as to alleviate the country's energy shortage. 
It has been learned that while Zhejiang and Guangdong are 
preparing to build their second nuclear power plants, Fujian, 
Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, Hainan, and some other 
provinces also are making preliminary preparations for building 
their own nuclear power plants. Moreover, provinces like Jilin, 
Sichuan, and Heilongjiang are already conducting feasibility 
studies for nuclear energy development. As the country has only 
limited construction funds, the departments concerned are 
expected to invite overseas investment and foreign funds to help 
with the country's nuclear development. 
  Slow energy development and a 20-plus percent shortage of 
electrical energy supply in the country has impeded the 
nationwide economic growth to some extent. In order to meet the 
growing demand for electrical energy and to guarantee a 
sufficient electrical energy supply across the country, apart 
from building more thermal power and hydropower stations, the 
authorities also are determined to speed up the country's 
nuclear energy development, as this causes less pollution. 
  It has been learned that since the two 900MW units installed 
at Daya Bay went into operation, Guangdong has decided to build 
its second nuclear power station in Lingao, north of Daya Bay, 
and a third one in Yangjiang. Construction of the Lingao and 
Yangjiang nuclear power plants is scheduled to be completed 
around the year 2002. The two nuclear power plants are to have 
four and six generating sets, respectively. By the year 2002, 
Guangdong's three nuclear power plants are expected to have a 
combined installed capacity of 10 million kWh, thus basically 
meeting the province's demand for electrical energy. 
  In Zhejiang, a 300MW generator installed at Qinshan during 
the first-phase construction has gone into operation. Now, two 
other 600MW generating sets are being installed as well as 
second-phase construction at the Qinshan nuclear power plant has 
begun. The two new generating sets are scheduled to go into 
operation in 1996. Zhejiang also has decided to build two 
2000MW nuclear power plants along its coast, in Sanmen Bay and 
Leqing, respectively. They are scheduled to go into operation 
by the turn of the century. 
  Moreover, a number of provinces with conditions for nuclear 
energy development are also preparing to build nuclear plants. 
Fujian is planning to build a nuclear plant in Shanqian 
township, Huian County, at the mouth of Quanzhou Bay. The plant 
will have six 900MW generating sets, with a combined installed 
capacity of 5.4 million kWh when its three-phase construction is 
completed. The plant will have generating sets when its 
first-phase construction is completed early in the next century. 
  Jiangxi also has decided to build a 3600MW nuclear plant at 
Maoziding Mountain in Guze County, Jiujiang City. Hainan 
Province is seeking a site on which to build a nuclear power 
plant, and is conducting feasibility studies regarding the 
first-phase construction of a 300MW generating set. Liaoning 
Province has decided to build a 1000MW nuclear plant in 
Wentuozi. Jiangsu, Shandong, and other provinces are conducting 
feasibility studies for building nuclear power plants. 
  It has been learned that apart from inviting urgently needed 
funds for its nuclear development from some foreign countries 
and regions, the country still will try to raise most of the 
funds it needs for this purpose in cooperation with the local 
departments concerned. This is why the Beijing authorities 
have decided to set up a rotating fund mechanism for nuclear 
development to guarantee a continued supply of funds for the 
country's nuclear power development. Minister of Power Industry 
Shi Dazhen pointed out that under the proposed rotation 
mechanism for nuclear development, after a nuclear power plant 
is built and goes into operation, the State will not try to 
collect its profits. Instead, the plant's profits will be used 
to build other nuclear power plants so that more such plants can 
be built across the country. The nuclear power plant is allowed 
to divert as much as 2.3 billion yuan of profits to other 
nuclear plants under construction so that more provinces will be 
able to build nuclear power plants. 
  Guangdong's Daya Bay nuclear power plant has been installed 
with French advanced pressurized-water reactors. In the future, 
the country is likely to continue purchasing French equipment 
for its nuclear plants, but as the Shanghai-made nuclear 
reactors installed at Qinshan have proven to be perfectly 
reliable and efficient, the country is more likely to use more 
domestically manufactured equipment. As a result, Shanghai 
certainly will become the country's nuclear equipment supply 
base.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  This paper reports the fabrication and performance of a 
high-sensitivity, low-dark-current GaAs long-wavelength 
quantum-well infrared photodetector (QWIP) we have developed. 
This QWIP is composed of 50 GaAs quantum wells and 
Al[.sub]0.28[/]Ga[.sub]0.72[/]As barriers. The device was 
made on a 320-m-diameter mesa. Its primary characteristics, 
i.e., responsivity and detectivity, are highly dependent upon 
bias current and operating temperature. The performance of the 
device was further upgraded through delicate design and improved 
fabrication technique. The peak detection wavelength is 9.2 
m. At an operating temperature of 77 K, the peak current 
responsivity is 9.7 x 10[.sup]5[/] V/W, the peak detectivity 
exceeds 1 x 10[.sup]11[/] cm-(Hz)[.sup]1/2[/]/W and the 
dark current is less than 0.1 A. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  An IR photodetector that relies on the transition of bound 
electrons in a quantum well to continuous states near the top of 
a potential barrier is developed on the basis of research on 
superlattice semiconductors. The QWIP has advantages such as 
fast response, high quantum efficiency, variable wavelength, 
good thermal stability and uniformity. Furthermore, it can be 
made into a large-area IR focal plane array (FPA), which plays 
an important role in IR imaging technology, novel IR 
spectrophotometers and space precision guidance systems. This 
new QWIP is a direction of further development in IR sensing 
technology and has become a leading-edge research topic 
worldwide. 
  In 1985, West and Eglash first observed the light transition 
effect inside a GaAs quantum well.[.sup]1[/] Later, Levine 
and coworkers accomplished a great deal in the development and 
improvement of a practical device.[.sup]2-10[/] A GaAs/AlGaAs 
MQW IR photodetector (MQWIP) was developed in 1987.[.sup]3[/] 
Initially, the device was designed to have two bound-state 
quantum wells. To improve its performance characteristics, they 
designed a novel superlattice structure,[.sup]4[/] which 
involved the transition between bound states in the wells to 
extended states in the conduction band to prevent light excited 
electrons from tunneling the barriers. Consequently, the barrier 
thickness can be increased to suppress dark current and thus 
raise detectivity. The best MQWIP was also developed by Levine 
et al; its primary specifications are as follows: operating 
temperature 77 K, peak wavelength 8 m, and peak detectivity 
D* = 4.0 x 10[.sup]10[/] 
cm-(Hz)[.sup]1/2[/]/W.[.sup]7[/] Currently, besides trying 
to improve performance further, the device has entered an 
application stage, i.e., fabricating it into a GaAs/AlGaAs FPA 
QWIP array.[.sup]11[/] It has already been successfully used 
in IR photography.[.sup]12[/] 
  Based on research done on the physics associated with the 
growth of GaAs/AlGaAs MQW materials, we began to develop QWIP. 
The emphasis is placed on structural design and fabrication 
technique improvement to further enhance performance. A 
high-sensitivity, low-dark-current, long-wavelength MQWIP has 
been successfully developed. Its performance characteristics 
have reached optimal levels known to date. 
<H5>  2. Device Preparation </H5>
  We went through the entire process of quantum-well design, 
material growth, device development and electrical and optical 
measurements. A 50-rectangular-MQW (75 Angstroms) GaAs/(300 
Angstroms) Al[.sub]0.28[/]Ga[.sub]0.72[/]As structure was 
prepared using a VGV80H MBE (molecular beam epitaxy) system 
manufactured in the UK. The growth and study of this 
high-quality QWIP material will be described in a separate paper. 
  Figure 1 [photograph not reproduced] shows the structure of 
the device. The device is a 320-m-diameter mesa made with 
conventional lithographic and chemical etching techniques. Thin 
AuGe/Ni layers are evaporated on the N[.sup]+[/]-GaAs layers 
on the top and bottom of the mesa. Excellent ohmic contacts are 
made after alloying. A thin Au layer covers this ohmic layer 
before a metal lead is ultrasonically welded to it. In order to 
increase the area of the ohmic contact layer and avoid shorting 
between electrodes to improve yield, it is required to have a 
good design for the lithographic pattern, to simplify the 
technique and to locate the optimal alloying conditions to make 
the best ohmic contact. The etching depth must be accurately 
controlled so that it penetrates the quantum well. The 
N[.sup]+[/]-GaAs layer at the top of the mesa must be exposed 
to make a good ohmic contact. In order to determine the etching 
depth, a new microscopy technique was developed: REM (Reflective 
Electron Microscopy) is used to observe the cross section of the 
etched mesa to directly and accurately determine the etching 
condition of the MQW mesa. Figure 2 [photograph not reproduced] 
shows a REM cross-sectional view of an etched mesa. It clearly 
shows the 50-period GaAs/AlGaAs MQW structure. The bright narrow 
lines and wide dark lines in the photograph are GaAs quantum 
wells and AlGaAs barriers, respectively. N[.sup]+[/]-GaAs 
layers are located on top and beneath the quantum-well region. 
The dark area on the right is an etched pit (the inclination of 
the pit is due to a slanted incident beam). From this picture, 
we can see that the etching depth is being controlled just right 
at the quantum-well region. 
  On the basis of the selectivity principle, the optical 
coupling of a MQWIP that relies on transitions between sub-bands 
within the conduction band is different from that depending on 
transitions between bands. The former requires that the 
polarization of light hitting the MQWIP must have an electrical 
vector perpendicular to the mesa. Hence, it usually enters at 45 
degrees from the back or uses a diffraction grating. We used a 
45-degree incline coupling method, as shown in Figure 1. This 
incline is mechanically ground and polished on the epitaxial 
substrate. 
<H5>  3. Device Characteristics and Results </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Voltage Versus Current Characteristics </H5>
  To test the quantum-well structure, dark current and leakage 
current due to electrode quality, the voltage/current curve was 
measured at 77 K with no light and the result is shown in Figure 
3. The curve clearly shows negative impedance damping. This 
illustrates the destruction and establishment of resonance 
between two neighboring wells as the electric field varies. In 
addition, it shows that dark current primarily comes from 
resonant tunneling current and it is below 0.2 A. If the 
barrier is made thicker, such as 300 Angstroms in specimen G122, 
then dark current could be reduced by two orders of magnitude to 
0.002 A. This will drastically increase detectivity. The 
apparent negative impedance damping and low dark current clearly 
prove that the MQW epitaxial material is of high quality and 
that the device has no leakage and has excellent ohmic contacts. 
We also calculated differential resistance as a function of bias 
from the 77 K current/voltage curve. Over the range of bias, the 
differential resistance is 1-10 M_O_. The low-temperature 
resistance of this QWIP is much larger than those of other types 
of photodetectors (such as a HgCdTe waveguide IR photodetector). 
Special care should be given to avoid loss of signal due to 
distributive capacitance of the leads.

<H5>  3.2 Measurement of Voltage Responsivity and Detectivity </H5>
  The photodetector was placed in a low-temperature E-1332 
freezer and the temperature was varied from 10-300 K. A 500 K 
blackbody source was modulated at 800 Hz and then entered the 
photodetector at an angle through the freezer window. The 
viewing angle of the photodetector is 136. A Keithley 220 
current supply is used to provide the constant bias current. An 
EG&amp;G 5210 lock-in amplifier is used to measure the rms signal 
voltage V[.sub]s[/] and rms noise voltage V[.sub]n[/]. 
  ``Introduction to Optoelectronic Devices,''[.sup]13[/] 
edited by Tang Dingyuan [3282 1353 0337] et al., describes a way 
to calculate blackbody voltage responsivity R[.sub]b[/] and 
blackbody detectivity D*[.sub]bb[/], i.e., 
  R[.sub]b[/] = 
V[.sub]s[/]/_Ph_[.sub]s[/](V/W) (1) 
  where _Ph_[.sub]s[/] is the rms fundamental frequency power 
of incident radiation which can be determined from some 
parameters related to the measurement system and test conditions 
(such as blackbody temperature, modulating disk temperature, 
blackbody emission aperture and photodetector illumination 
area). The blackbody detectivity is 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-02B>      Equation </FIG>


  when A[.sub]d[/] is the photodetector area and _D_f is the 
bandwidth of the measurement circuit. The GaAs/AlGaAs MQWIP is a 
narrow-band photodetector. Therefore, its performance is usually 
expressed in terms of its peak detectivity 
D*[.sub]_l_p[/].[.sup]10[/] Its equation is as follows: 

Equation 

  The correction factor &Ggr; can be expressed as follows: 

Equation 

  where _n_ is the wave number. M[.sub]b[/](500K, _n_) is 
the blackbody radiation power distribution function which can be 
expressed by Planck's equation that describes blackbody 
radiation. R(_n_), wave-number responsivity, is expressed by a 
peak normalized Gaussian distribution. Its peak position and 
half-height width can be determined from the IR spectrum of 
sub-band transition. Reference 3 confirms that the 
frequency-response spectrum is similar in shape to the sub-band 
transition IR spectrum. Therefore, the above analysis is 
reasonable. 
<H5>  3.3 Dependence of Peak Detectivity </H5>
D*[.sub]_l_p[/] Upon Bias Current and Temperature 
  Optoelectronic performance characteristics such as peak 
detectivity D*[.sub]_l_p[/] of a sub-band transition QWIP are 
closely related to its operating conditions. We found that 
detectivity varies significantly with the bias current, as shown 
in Figure 4. Furthermore, a different curve exists for each 
temperature. Obviously, each photodetector has an optimal 
operating point at a specific temperature. At that point, it has 
the maximum detectivity. The corresponding current is the 
optimal bias current (which varies as a function of operating 
temperature). Hence, it is very important to ensure that a QWIP 
operates at this optimal point. Figure 5 shows detectivity as a 
function of operating temperature. Especially after the 
operating temperature exceeds liquid-N[.sub]2[/] temperature 
(77 K), detectivity drops even faster. The MQWIP developed 
should also have blackbody response when the operating 
temperature exceeds 100 K.

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-03B>      Figure 5. Peak Detectivity vs. Operating Temperature </FIG>


<H5>  3.4 Measured Results </H5>
  Five different sets of QWIPs of different dimensions have 
been prepared. Table 1 shows their primary performance 
characteristics at 77 K. The measurement of responsivity and 
detectivity was discussed earlier. Specimen parameters and test 
conditions are as follows (for specimen G236): photodetector 
area 8.04 x 10[.sup]-4[/] cm[.sup]2[/], blackbody emission 
aperture 0.4 cm, distance between emission aperture and 
photodetector 20 cm, modulation frequency 799 Hz, measurement 
circuit bandwidth 24.08 Hz, and window transmissivity 63 
percent. Table 1 only gives the voltage responsivity 
R[.sub]_n_[/]. The current responsivity R[.sub]i[/] can be 
calculated from R[.sub]_n_[/] and the calculated differential 
resistance r, i.e., R[.sub]i[/] = R[.sub]_n_[/]/r. For 
instance, the optimal bias current for specimen G236 at 77 K is 
9 x 10[.sup]-7[/] A (from Figure 4). The corresponding 
differential resistance r = 2.4 x 10[.sup]6[/] _O_ (which is 
looked up from the differential resistance vs. bias-current 
curve). Corresponding to voltage responsivity R[.sub]_n_[/] = 
9.7 x 10[.sup]5[/] (V/W), the current responsivity 
R[.sub]i[/] = 0.4 A/W. This is comparable to the highest 
value ever reported worldwide. In addition, from Table 1, the 
most important indicator of the GaAs/AlGaAs long-wavelength 
MQWIP developed, D*[.sub]_l_p[/], i.e., peak detectivity at 
77 K, has exceeded 10[.sup]11[/] cm-(Hz)[.sup]1/2[/]/W. 
This is higher than the best level ever reported 
worldwide.[.sup]7[/]

<H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>
  The MQWIP, a recently developed IR photodetector, is an 
important direction of development in IR sensing technology. It 
has advantages such as fast response, high quantum efficiency, 
good thermal stability and excellent uniformity, and has become 
a leading-edge subject worldwide. 
  This paper reports the preparation and characterization of a 
high-sensitivity, low-dark-current GaAs long-wavelength MQWIP. 
By way of careful design and process improvement, the 
performance of this device is further enhanced. At 77 K, the 
peak detectivity, D*[.sub]_l_p[/], has exceeded 1 x 
10[.sup]11[/] cm-(Hz)[.sup]1/2[/]/W and the dark current 
is below 0.1 A. These are better than anything else reported 
worldwide.

Optic Vibration Testing and Analysis System Unveiled in

  [Summary] Chengdu (ZHONGGUO KEXUE BAO wire report) -- The 
YM1000 large-scale fiber optic dynamic vibration testing and 
analysis system--jointly developed by the University of 
Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and Shenzhen 
Yangming [7122 2494] Fiber Optic Technology Ltd.--passed formal 
technical appraisal in Chengdu a few days ago. This achievement 
is a major advance for domestic fiber optic sensor utilitarian 
testing technology. The system's main performance indicators 
match those of advanced foreign-made early-90s products, and the 
indicator for temperature stability exceeds that for comparable 
foreign-made early-90s products. The prototype system, built at 
the 1987 request of the Shanghai Electric Machine Plant and 
completed by UESTC in October 1991, was used in a successful 
experimental test of vibration at the ends of the stator 
windings in the 300 mW and 125 mW turbogenerators at the 
Shanghai plant, and passed technical appraisal at that time. 
The YM1000 system, a digitized, modular, ``smart'' 
second-generation system developed upon the prototype, has been 
used in a successful vibration test of the stator winding ends 
in the 12 mW turbogenerator at the Eastern Electric Machine

Gratings All Grown by MBE''; MS received 24 Jul 93, revised 23

  [Text] 
<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  For the first time, a GaAlAs/GaAs multiquantum-well (MQW) 
gain-coupled distributive feedback (DFB) semiconductor laser 
with internal absorptive grating has been successfully 
fabricated using a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique. The 
lasing wavelength is 860 nm at room temperature and a peak power 
of more than 20 mW has been achieved in single-mode pulse 
operation. The device operates in single longitudinal mode (SLM) 
between 0C and 80C. As a preliminary result, the 
threshold current for a 5-6-m-wide oxide device is 
approximately 700 mA. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The DFB semiconductor laser is one of the critical devices 
used in large-scale, long-range fiber optic communications. As 
electro-optic devices are being developed, the DFB laser also 
plays an important role in optical information processing and 
optical measurement. There are two DFB laser feedback 
mechanisms, i.e., index-of-refraction-coupled and 
gain-coupled.[.sup]1[/] The use of a structure to separately 
block carriers and optical waveguide makes the index-coupled DFB 
laser a practical device; it becomes the mainstream of DFB 
semiconductor lasers. Nevertheless, there is a stop band in an 
index-coupled DFB device and there are two lowest modes of the 
same gain threshold on either side of the stop 
band.[.sup]1[/] Therefore, an index-coupled DFB device, in 
principle, does not operate in a single mode. This issue becomes 
more critical in dynamic operating conditions. Using a _l_/4 
phase shifter,[.sup]2[/] a strip width 
modulator,[.sup]3[/] or a high-reflection/no-reflection 
coating[.sup]4[/] can overcome mode degeneracy and improve 
single-mode yield. However, single-mode stability can easily be 
affected by spatial hole burning[.sup]5[/] and end 
reflection.[.sup]6[/] 
  Contrary to the problem we discussed above, the lowest gain 
threshold mode of a gain-coupled DFB laser is at the Bragg 
wavelength. Hence, it is truly operating in a single mode. Even 
a compound DFB laser that is both index-coupled and gain-coupled 
can also totally eliminate mode degeneracy and operate in a 
single mode.[.sup]7[/] 
  On the basis of understanding of its superiority, research 
on 
gain-coupled DFB laser devices is very active worldwide. To 
date, there are two ways to incorporate the gain-coupling 
mechanism into a DFB laser. One is to fabricate a gain grating. 
For instance, a grating can be grown on an active layer using an 
OMVPE [organo-metallic vapor-phase epitaxy] technique on a 
non-planar surface.[.sup]8,9[/] The other way is to 
incorporate a loss grating near the active layer to periodically 
modulate the net gain of the laser.[.sup]10[/] 
  Compared to index-coupled DFB lasers, gain-coupled DFB 
lasers 
of both types have a number of advantages, including higher 
single-mode yield,[.sup]11,12[/] extremely low chirping at 
high dynamic modulation,[.sup]13,14[/] capability to generate 
single-mode ultra-short pulses[.sup]13[/] and low noise 
induced by external reflection.[.sup]15[/] The gain-coupled 
DFB laser has proven its role in optical communications. 
  A gain-coupled DFB laser with an absorptive loss grating is 
attracting more attention because there are no special 
requirements in its fabrication. Devices have been fabricated 
worldwide using techniques such as OMVPE, LPE [liquid-phase 
epitaxy] and CBE [chemical beam epitaxy] with materials such as 
GaAlAs, InGaAlAs and InGaAsP.[.sup]10,14,16,17,18[/] In this 
work, for the first time a GaAlAs/GaAs gain-coupled MQW DFB 
laser with an absorptive grating has been successfully prepared 
using MBE. In addition, for the first time in China, a 
gain-coupled DFB laser has successfully lased at room 
temperature. 
<H5>  2. Device Structure and Fabrication Technique </H5>
  Figure 1 shows a cross-sectional view of the laser. The 
active layer employs an MQW structure to further optimize the 
performance of the device. An absorptive loss grating is 
incorporated on top of the active layer to periodically modulate 
the longitudinal optical field of the laser. This is equivalent 
to a periodic modulation of the net gain of the optical field 
mode along the longitudinal axis in order to incorporate the 
gain-coupling mechanism into the laser. In the structure shown, 
the change of conduction mode of the absorptive loss grating to 
n type as compared to its surrounding p type can further lower 
the threshold and improve the nonlinearity effect caused by 
absorption saturation.[.sup]18[/] The gain-coupling 
coefficient, a parameter that reflects the strength of optical 
feedback as a result of periodically changing gain, is a direct 
function of factors such as the absorption coefficient of the 
grating material and grating thickness. To this end, we 
calculated the relation between the absorptive layer thickness 
and gain-coupling coefficient.[.sup]19[/] After taking actual 
fabrication into consideration, we only calculated a three-stage 
grating and the result is shown in Figure 2. When the absorptive 
layer is more than 50 nm thick, the normalized gain-coupling 
coefficient is greater than 0.8, which is sufficiently large to 
improve device performance. On the other hand, increasing the 
absorptive layer thickness will also raise the dc component of 
the periodic loss, i.e., the average mode loss, which causes an 
increase in the threshold current of the device. Therefore, the 
thickness of the grating has been fixed at 50-80 nm. A carrier 
blocking layer is introduced between upper guiding and 
absorptive grating to effectively confine injected carriers in 
the active layer. A high-refractance epitaxial layer, i.e., a 
low-Al-composition layer, is added underneath the absorptive 
grating layer. On one hand, it acts as a waveguide to enhance 
the effect of the grating to raise the coupling coefficient. On 
the other hand, it can avoid possible oxidation and 
contamination of the high-Al-composition grating due to exposure 
to air during fabrication.

Thickness When Bulk Absorption Coefficient Is 5,000 
cm[.sup]-1[/]&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  In the first MBE process the following layers are grown on 
top of a Si-doped (1-2 x 10[.sup]18[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]) GaAs 
substrate: n-Ga[.sub]0.56[/]Al[.sub]0.44[/]As lower 
cladding layer (1.5 m, 5 x 10[.sup]17[/] 
cm[.sup]-3[/]), Ga[.sub]0.79[/]Al[.sub]0.21[/]As lower 
guiding layer (0.25 m, undoped), 
Ga[.sub]0.79[/]Al[.sub]0.21[/]As/GaAs triple-quantum-well 
active layer (well width 10 nm, barrier width 12 nm, undoped), 
Ga[.sub]0.79[/]Al[.sub]0.21[/]As upper guiding layer (0.25 
m, undoped), p-Ga[.sub]0.56[/]Al[.sub]0.44[/]As carrier 
blocking layer (0.15 m, 5 x 10[.sup]17[/] 
cm[.sup]-3[/]), p-Ga[.sub]0.76[/]Al[.sub]0.21[/]As 
guiding layer (0.05 m, 5 x 10[.sup]17[/] 
cm[.sup]-3[/]), and n[.sup]+[/]-GaAs absorptive layer 
(0.05 m, 1 x 10[.sup]18[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]). 
  Because it is impossible to fabricate primary GaAlAs/GaAs 
gratings using conventional techniques and the process to make 
secondary gratings is hard to control, we chose to fabricate a 
tertiary grating that is capable of having a sufficiently high 
coupling coefficient under a given set of 
conditions.[.sup]18[/] A holographic exposure system based on 
a 325-nm ultraviolet laser was employed to make a tertiary 
grating with a periodicity of 378 nm. Afterward, it was 
chemically etched in 
H[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/]:H[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]2[/]:H[.sub]2[/]O 
= 9:1:1 at 5C for 4 seconds to obtain a triangular 
absorptive loss grating. 
  In the second MBE process, a 
p-Ga[.sub]0.56[/]Al[.sub]0.44[/]As upper cladding layer (1 
m, 5 x 10[.sup]17[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]) and a 
p[.sup]+[/]-GaAs ohmic contact (0.5 m, 1 x 
10[.sup]19[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]) were grown on top of the 
grating. Making a DFB laser using an MBE technique has not been 
reported in China and is extremely rare elsewhere in the world. 
The difficulty involved is the secondary epitaxy process on the 
grating due to the fact that crystal quality and surface 
morphology of the boundary are adversely affected by oxidation 
and contamination. We also encountered a great deal of 
difficulty in this work. A unique secondary epitaxy 
technique[.sup]20[/] based on the characteristics of MBE was 
developed to overcome this problem. 
  To simplify the technique, the device has a basic oxide film 
strip structure. A 200-nm-thick SiO[.sub]2[/] film was 
deposited by RF sputtering. A 5-6-m-wide strip was obtained 
by etching in a buffered HF solution. A p-type Au-Cr contact and 
an n-type Au-Ge-Ni contact were made by evaporation. 
<H5>  3. Device Performance </H5>
  Lasing was successfully achieved at room temperature. Figure 
3 shows the output light intensity as a function of injected 
current for a 300-m cavity device operating with 500 ns and 
1 
kHz pulses. The threshold of the device is 700 mA at 20C. 
The primary reason for this high threshold current is that the 
device does not have any lateral blocking. In addition, the 
quality of the primary epitaxy process needs to be improved. 
Figure 4 shows the lasing spectra of the same device at 
different injection currents. When the injection current is 
approximately 0.9 times the threshold (see Figure 4(a)), besides 
the Fabry-Perot mode at the gain peak, the DFB mode 7 nm away is 
significantly enhanced. This is a piece of evidence that this 
mode has a larger threshold gain difference compared to other 
surrounding modes. When the injection current approaches the 
threshold, the DFB mode begins to lase (see Figure 4(b)) at 
approximately 860 nm. As the current is further increased (see 
Figure 4(c)), it operates completely in a single mode. It is 
worthwhile to point out that it is difficult to see a stop band 
in a gain-coupled DFB laser. Our device is no exception. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-07A>      Figure 3. Peak Output Power vs. Injected Current </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-07B>      Figure 4. Lasing Spectra at Different Injection Currents </FIG>


  In addition, the peak single-mode optical output is over 20 
mW. Higher power spectra were not measured because of the danger 
that the photomultiplier tube might be damaged. However, from 
Figure 3, the peak pulse output should be no less than 50 mW. 
Besides the large optical cavity effect due to the relatively 
thick guiding layer in the device, it also illustrates the 
advantage that a gain-coupled DFB laser is not affected by space 
burning at high power levels. 
  Figure 5 shows the lasing wavelength as a function of 
temperature. Due to equipment limitation, it was only measured 
between 0C and 80C. No mode hopping took place within 
this temperature range. The temperature coefficient of the 
wavelength is approximately 0.07 nm/C. This is another 
piece of evidence that our device is operating in the DFB mode. 
Figure 6 shows the lasing spectra at different temperatures. It 
is obvious that it continues to operate in a complete single 
mode up to 80C.

<H5>  4. Conclusions </H5>
  A GaAlAs/GaAs MQW gain-coupled DFB laser with an absorptive 
grating has been successfully fabricated using an MBE technique 
for the first time. At room temperature, the device lases at 860 
nm. At 20C, the current threshold is 700 mA. The device 
remains lasing in SLM within a range of 0C to 80C. The 
peak power in single-mode single-ended output at room 
temperature could exceed 20 mW.

Develops Three New Optoelectronic Couplers''] 
  [Summary] MEI Institute 44 recently completed development 
of three new optoelectronic couplers: a high-speed/high-voltage 
optoelectronic coupler, a Z-type optical coupler, and an 
integrated-circuit-type optoelectronic coupler. Performance 
indicators for these couplers meet or exceed those of the 6N136 
and 6N137 commercial products made by the U.S. firm HP [Hewlett 
Packard]. Moreover, these Institute 44 products use a black 
ceramic metallized package, providing noticeably higher 
reliability than comparable resin packages. The high-speed, 
high-voltage optoelectronic coupler is used for driving TTL 
signals, relays, pulse amplifiers, high-voltage signal 
transmitters, and A/D converters. The Z-type optical coupler is 
used in gyro accelerometers and also in computer-peripherals 
interface circuits in office automation systems and in 
isolated-signal transmission systems. The IC-type high-speed 
optoelectronic coupler is oriented toward computer-based digital 
communications systems and real-time control systems.

large-photosensitive-surface non-magnetic photodiode, an 
embargoed optoelectronic detector used in asdic [i.e. 
anti-submarine detection] systems; the GZ1140Z 
broad-passband-range, low-intra-passband-ripple, 
steep-transition-band CCD [charge-coupled device] recursive 
filter used in new-generation radar systems; the SK161 coaxial 
hermetic package used in high-power pulsed laser diodes for key 
State projects and also for laser diode arrays and LEDs; the 
GD5281Y high-sensitivity, broad-dynamic-range quadrant avalanche 
detector [i.e. photodiode] used in missile guidance and 
tracking, security monitoring, medical diagnosis, and robot 
vision systems; the GH5200Q zero-light-detection switch; the 
GH1200Z and two other models of optical couplers; and the 
GH8740J and one other ac/dc solid state relay.

New Series of Fiber Optic Communications Devices''] 
  [Summary] Hangzhou, 25 Apr (KEJI RIBAO wire report) -- The 
State 863 Program projects in R&amp;D of optoelectronic devices 
and 
integration technologies have realized major advances in the 
areas of fiber optic communications devices and quantum well 
devices. As revealed to this writer today by CAS Academician 
Zhou Bingkun, major steps forward have also been taken in 
domestic industrialization of these products. Some specific 
accomplishments include development of a distributed-feedback 
(DFB) laser diode that passed a 100,000-hour lifetime test, is 
now being used in a fiber optic project undertaken by a 
Chongqing joint venture firm, and has been provided to Bell Labs 
[i.e. Bellcore] in the U.S. as well as to laboratories in Italy, 
Germany, and elsewhere. In the area of quantum well 
optoelectronic devices and integration technologies, a batch of 
high-performance devices have been developed, among which a 
short-wavelength quantum well low-threshold-current laser diode 
meets current international standards. Some of the 863 
Program-supported devices are now in the initial stages of 
industrialization: for example, a 0.808-micron-wavelength 
high-power semiconductor laser has been incorporated into a 
10-element phase-locked quantum well laser diode array, 1000 
units of which are now being manufactured annually. It is 
understood that over 1200 technologists nationwide are engaged 
in 863 Program-supported optoelectronics research; over a 3-year 
period, they have taken on 110 projects, of which 30 have passed 
formal technical appraisal, while at least 10 have received 
State patents or Minis try/Commission-level S&amp;T advancement 
awards.

  [Text] 
<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  Research on a GaAs 1 x 2 MZ waveguide switch/modulator is 
reported. The operating principle of the device is analyzed. The 
device employs a Y branch as a 3 dB coupler and an asymmetric X 
junction as an interferometer. At a wavelength of 1.15 m, 
the 
switch was found to have a crosstalk ratio of less than -16 dB 
and a switching voltage of 19 V. The device is expected to be 
widely used in GaAs 1 x n switching arrays and high-speed 
optical modulators. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  In integrated optics, optical switches and light modulators 
are basic devices not only widely used in optical 
communications, optical computing and optical information 
processing systems but also are basic components in optical 
switching arrays. In recent years, significant progress has been 
made in optical switch/modulators. The speed of the 
electro-optic MZ interferometric modulator/switch has reached 
26.4 GHz.[.sup]1[/] The modulating speed of a phase modulator 
is as high as 110 GHz.[.sup]2[/] Following are the main 
electro-optic modulator/switch structures: 
  (1) a MZ switch/modulator that couples a Y branch with three 
waveguides,[.sup]3,4[/]; 
  (2) a directionally coupled modulator/switch,[.sup]5[/]; 
  (3) a BOA [bifurcated optically active] optical 
switch/modulator,[.sup]6[/]; 
  (4) an asymmetric MZ switch/modulator.[.sup]7,8[/] 
  Each structure has its own unique characteristics and has 
been widely studied and used in various applications. A Y-branch 
MZ waveguide modulator that employs two Y branch couplers as the 
input usually only can function as a modulator because there is 
only one input and one output. In reference 8, we reported a 2 x 
2 GaAs symmetric MZ switch/modulator. In this 2 x 2 switch, two 
asymmetric X junctions are used to replace the Y-branch couple 
in a Y-branch modulator to form a 2 x 2 switch. Since the two 
modulating waveguides in this switch have different widths, a 
propagation constant difference usually exists. In a pulse input 
mode, pulses are often lost. Therefore, such a device cannot 
operate in a pulse mode. For the first time, a 1 x 2 GaAs MZ 
waveguide switch/modulator is reported. An asymmetric X junction 
is used to replace the interferometer in a Y-branch modulator. 
The device not only has an excellent 3 dB light splitting effect 
as a Y-branch coupler but also has the characteristics of a 1 x 
2 switch. Furthermore, its modulating waveguide is symmetrical, 
solving the problem of a 2 x 2 symmetric MZ switch operating in 
the pulse mode. It makes the Y-branch MZ waveguide modulator 
more useful over a wide range of applications. 
<H5>  2. Basic Principle </H5>
  Figure 1 shows the structure of a single-mode, Y-branch 
modulator. When a polarized beam of light enters from the input 
end of the modulator, it is split into two identical beams by 
the Y-branch coupler. These two beams of identical power pass 
through two electro-optically active regions to determine their 
phase difference. In addition, interference takes place in 
another Y-branch coupler. The basic mode produced is sent out 
via the waveguide. The first-order mode produced is cutoff in 
the single-mode output waveguide and is scattered to the 
substrate or the flat waveguide. The principle of the asymmetric 
X-junction is discussed in reference 9. When the X-junction 
branching angle _th_ &lt; _D__b_/_g_, the asymmetric 
X-junction 
plays a mode-separation role. Figure 2 shows the basic principle 
of the X-junction as an interferometer. When two identically 
polarized beams come in from its symmetric input ends, they 
superpose each other in the interference region and even modes 
are produced to exit from the wide waveguide (as shown in Figure 
2(b)). When two beams of opposite polarization enter from the 
symmetric input ends, odd modes are produced in the interference 
region and exit from the narrow waveguide (as shown in Figure 
2(c)). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-15A>      Figure 1. Principle of a Single-Mode, Y-Branch Modulator </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-15B>      Figure 2. Principle of Using an X-Junction as an Interferometer </FIG>


  On the basis of the above analysis, this X-junction MZ 
modulator not only preserves the advantages of a MZ modulator, 
such as high-speed modulation, but also can work as a 1 x 2 
switching element to form a switching array. Figure 3 shows the 
operating principle of the switch. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-15C>      Figure 3. Principle of the 1 x 2 Switch </FIG>


  A polarized beam is split into two beams of identical power 
by the Y-branch 3 dB coupler. After passing through the 
electro-optic modulating region, the relative phase difference 
is obtained. Furthermore, as a result of interference in the 
asymmetric X-junction, even modes will exit from the wide 
waveguide and odd modes from the narrow waveguide, i.e., 
  P[.sub]out1[/] = 
P[.sub]in[/]cos[.sup]2[/](_Ph_/2), (1a) 
  P[.sub]out2[/] = 
P[.sub]in[/]sin[.sup]2[/](_D__Ph_/2), (1b) 
  _D__Ph_ = _D__Ph_[.sub]e[/] + 
_D__Ph_[.sub]0[/], (1c) 
  where _D__Ph_[.sub]0[/] is the initial phase difference and 
_D__Ph_[.sub]e[/] is the relative phase difference caused by 
electro-optic effect. 
  In equation (1) only _D__Ph_[.sub]e[/] is a function of 
applied voltage V, i.e., 
  _D__Ph_[.sub]e[/] = 
(/_l_)r[.sub]41[/]n[.sup]3[/]L&Ggr;V/d, (2) 
  where L is the length of the electrode, d is the waveguide 
thickness, &Ggr; represents an overlapping integral, n is the 
index of refraction and r[.sub]41[/] is the electro-optic 
coefficient. 
<H5>  3. High-Speed Switching Characteristics </H5>
  The high-speed switching characteristics of electro-optic 
modulators are limited in two areas. 
  The modulation bandwidth of lumped-electrode devices is: 
  _D_f[.sub]0[/] [congruent] 1/(2R[.sub]s[/]CL), (3) 
  where C is the junction capacitance per unit length, L is 
the 
length of the electrode and R[.sub]s[/] is the matching 
resistance. 
  From the above equation we know that modulation bandwidth is 
limited by junction capacitance. Reducing junction capacitance 
is the primary way to raise the switching speed of a 
lumped-electrode device. 
  For a traveling wave device, the modulating speed is limited 
by the mismatch between electric and optical field. The 
modulation bandwidth is: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-15D>      Equation </FIG>

  _D_f[.sub]e[/] = 
1.4c/L(n[.sub]0[/]-n[.sub]u[/] (4) 
  where n[.sub]0[/] and n[.sub]u[/] are the optic and 
microwave refractance, respectively, and L is the length of the 
interaction region. 
  To date, the bandwidth of a lumped-electrode 3 dB MZ 
modulator is as wide as 8.4 GHz and that of a traveling wave 3 
dB MZ modulator is as wide as 24.6 GHz. 
<H5>  4. Crosstalk Analysis </H5>
  In an asymmetric 1 x 2 MZ switch, crosstalk comes from two 
sources. One is due to asymmetry of the two branch waveguides of 
the Y-branch 3 dB coupler resulting in two beams of unequal 
power. 
  Assume the beam power levels are I[.sub]1[/] and 
I[.sub]2[/] and a relative phase delay of _D__Ph_/2 is 
obtained after passage through the interference region. Then, 
the crosstalk is: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-16A>      Equation </FIG>


  The other cause is due to a large branching angle of the 
X-junction, which results in incomplete mode separation to 
produce crosstalk. In reference 9, the authors calculated 
mode-separation amplitude ratios at various angles. 
<H5>  5. Design and Fabrication of the Device </H5>
  The dimension of the single-mode waveguide is calculated 
using the effective refractance method and the X-junction angle 
is derived from equation (2). Figure 4 shows the device 
parameters. The device is fabricated on a 
n[.sup]-[/]/n[.sup]+[/]GaAs epitaxial wafer which is 
prepared by means of vapor-phase epitaxy. The device is made by 
etching. The waveguide is chemically etched in 
H[.sub]3[/]PO[.sub]4[/]:H[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]2[/]:H[.sub]2[/]O 
= 1:1:10 at 25C for 2 minutes and 30 seconds to produce a 
1.2-m ridge. Figure 5(a) shows the parameters of the ridge 
waveguide. A lumped-electrode modulation mode was chosen. The 
upper electrode is an Al-Schottky barrier contact and the lower 
electrode is an Au-Ge-Ni ohmic contact. The electrode parameters 
are shown in Figure 5(b).

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-16C>      Figure 5. (a) Ridge-Waveguide Parameters and (b) Electrode Parameters </FIG>


<H5>  6. Testing and Results </H5>
  A beam of polarized light enters the waveguide after passing 
through a lens. The light that exits the waveguide is collimated 
again by a lens to be captured by an infrared camera. The light 
spot is displayed on a monitor and the optical field 
distribution is recorded in memory. Figure 6 [photograph not 
reproduced] shows the distribution of light spot and optical 
field at different voltages. If the switching voltage is defined 
as the amount of applied voltage required to change the output 
optical power from maximum to minimum or vice versa, then at 
_l_ 
= 1.15 m it was found that the switching voltage is 19 V and 
crosstalk ratio is -16 dB. Figure 7 shows the variation of 
optical power at the two outputs as a function of modulation 
voltage. The modulating electrode is a lumped electrode. At zero 
bias voltage, the electrode capacitance was measured to be 
approximately 4 pF. If the matching resistor is 50 _O_, then 
the 
bandwidth of the device is expected to be greater than 1.8 GHz. 
The transmission loss of the waveguide is determined by 
measuring its attenuation coefficient,[.sup]10[/] i.e., 
measuring the output power of the waveguide at different 
wavelengths with identical input optical power and then 
determining transmission loss according to the following 
equation: 
  _a_ = ln (I[.sub]1[/]/I[.sub]2[/])/(Z[.sub]2[/] - 
Z[.sub]1[/], 
  transmission loss = 4.3 _a_ (dB/cm), 
  where Z[.sub]i[/] is the waveguide length (i = 1, 2...) 
and I[.sub]i[/] is the light intensity. By measuring a large 
number of specimens, transmission loss can be accurately 
determined. With waveguide parameters described above, 
transmission loss was measured to be approximately 7 dB/cm. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-17A>      Figure 7. Output Power vs. Modulating Voltage </FIG>


<H5>  7. Discussion </H5>
  From Figure 7, the light output power ratio of the two 
output 
waveguides is about 4:1. This indicates that there is a relative 
phase difference between the two polarized light beams passing 
through those two waveguides. It also means that the two 
parallel waveguides have different propagation constants. Under 
circumstances wherein the waveguides are intact, this suggests 
that the two waveguides are not exactly symmetric. This minute 
asymmetry is primarily introduced in the fabrication process. As 
far as the Y-branch coupler is concerned, a minute asymmetry 
will seriously affect the beam-splitting ratio. We have already 
discussed the crosstalk ratio due to uneven beam splitting. 
  In addition, the waveguide used is a 
n[.sup]-[/]/n[.sup]+[/] homojunction waveguide. This 
structure does not limit the optical field much. A large amount 
of optical field is distributed in the low-resistance substrate. 
This not only increases the transmission loss but also reduces 
the overlapping integral between the optical field and electric 
field (&Ggr;) and causes the half-wave voltage to rise. An 
effective way to solve this problem is to use a GaAs/GaAlAs 
heterojunction. The difference in index of refraction between 
the GaAlAs limiting layer and the GaAs waveguide is relatively 
large (approximately 10[.sup]-2[/]) and the optical field can 
be effectively confined within the waveguide. Therefore, 
absorptive loss in the substrate and metal electrode can be 
reduced and the overlapping integral can be increased. Moreover, 
the waveguide of this type of structure is thinner (&lt; 1 
m) 
and the half-wave voltage is also drastically lower. Presently, 
transmission loss of a GaAs heterojunction is less than 0.2 
dB/cm,[.sup]11[/] and the half-wave voltage of such an 
electro-optic modulator is less than 5 V.[.sup]1[/] 
<H5>  8. Conclusion </H5>
  A 1 x 2 GaAs asymmetric MZ waveguide switch/modulator using 
a 
Y-branch coupler and an asymmetric X-junction is presented. A 
switching voltage of 19 V and a crosstalk ratio of -16 dB have 
been achieved. The device can be used as a switching element in 
a 1 x n switching array and as a high-speed modulator.

  [Abstract] The authors have designed and developed a 
high-speed time-division-multiplexing (TDM) 
directional-coupler-type 1 x 4 optical switching array with an 
operating wavelength of 1.3 m. This array, shown 
schematically in Figure 1 below, integrates three directional 
couplers on a LiNbO[.sub]3[/] substrate. The directional 
couplers employ a step _D__b_ modulation method; directional 
coupler gap is 5 m, waveguide width is 7 m, and 
interaction length L is 7mm. The input and output waveguides 
require butt splicing with a 1.3-m single-mode fiber; 
spacing 
P between the input and output waveguides should exceed 125 
m, with 150 m chosen as the design value. Circular arc 
radius R is greater than or equal to 40mm, circular arc 
waveguide length L[.sub]R[/] is 4mm, bend-angle straight 
waveguide length L[.sub]S[/] is 3mm, device overall length is 
less than 3 cm, and bend angle _th_ is 0.5 degree. Ti film 
thickness is 600 angstroms, and diffusion conditions are 
1050 C for 7 hours. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-18A>      Figure 1. Practical Structure for 1x4 Optical Switch Array. </FIG>


  Device fabrication process is as follows: z-cut 
LiNbO[.sub]3[/] crystal surface sputtering of Ti film, 
etching of Ti lines, diffusion in high-temperature wet argon and 
wet oxygen gases to form the waveguides, waveguide surface 
deposition of SiO[.sub]2[/] film, end-face collimation and 
polishing, clear testing, evaporation of Al film, electrode 
alignment, ultrasonic pressure welding of electrode leads, 
fiber-optic waveguide butt splicing in a V-groove, and 
performance testing. Measured performance parameters are: 
device insertion loss = -7 dB to -9 dB, crosstalk = approx. -20 
dB, switch response time is less than 1.4 ns, switch drive 
voltage = 15-20 V. The TDM analysis for the entire switching 
array is shown in Figure 2 below (in which SW refers to 
directional coupler). There are no tables.

  [Abstract] A detailed description of the effect of 
coupling area on the branching ratio of an optical fiber 
directional coupler is given. The effect is calculated 
theoretically. Fiber directional couplers with continuously 
variable branching ratio (full range from 1/1 to 0/1) have been

branching ratio. 
  Figures 1-6, not reproduced, show the following: the 
experimental equipment, consisting of a 632.8-nm-wavelength 
He-Ne laser, a biconvex lens, the fiber, the coupler, two more 
biconvex lenses, and two detectors; the structure and side view 
of the coupler; a vertical view of the coupler rotating through 
a certain angle; a power density transform diagram; cross

splitting is proposed for the first time. It can be integrated 
into one device by using a Dammann splitting grating and 
phase-type Fresnel microlens array based on the phase 
superposition principle and VLSI techniques. A new

holographic beam-splitter (CGFBS)--has been fabricated. This 
device enables spots splitting of 128 x 128 arrays and 
superlarge spots arrays.

<F P=106> [Article by Peng Dejian [1756 1795 1696]: ``Instrument for </F>
Measuring Atmospheric Coherence Length and Isoplanatic Angle''] 
  [Summary] An atmospheric coherence length 
measurer/isoplanatic goniometer was recently built by a CAS 
Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics (AIOFM) group led 
by Research Fellow Song Zhengfang [1345 2973 2455]. This 
instrument, developed as an ``863-308'' State High-Tech Plan 
(Information Expert Topical Area) project, will provide a key 
new measurement and monitoring means for atmospheric 
comprehensive peace [i.e. nuclear test-ban] monitoring. 
Compared to the differential satellite imagery moving 
monitoring (DIMM) instrument developed by the European Southern 
Observatory (ESO), the Chinese instrument meets late-8Os 
international standards. The instrument is designed to measure 
atmospheric coherence length r by a double-optical-path 
satellite imagery moving differential method and to measure 
isoplanatic angle theta by a satellite light scintillation 
method. The prototype AIOFM instrument, completed in July 1992 
and incorporating advanced technologies such as CCD detectors 
and real-time computerized data processing, has been in trial 
use at the Yunnan Observatory. Scientists there obtained over 
2000 sets of data (measurements of r and theta) on 20 different 
nights. Recently, measurements of r and theta via integration 
of Cn(h) data obtained by a temperature ripple sonde were taken 
in Hefei simultaneously with measurements taken in Yunnan via 
the new method: the average values of the two sets of data 
differed by only 7 percent.

<F P=106> [Article signed YR/AL: "Joint Venture ABB-Renault. Green </F>
Light From Brussels"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Brussels 10 Mar (ATS) -- On Thursday, the European 
Commission authorized the creation of a joint venture between 
Asea Brown Boveri [ABB] and Renault Automation in the field of 
robotics and systems for the automobile industry. The operation 
does not create or reinforce a dominant position in the common 
market, according to the executive of the Twelve. 
  The operation contemplated by ABB and Renault is of a 
two-fold nature. On the one hand it comprises the creation of a 
new joint venture, Newco, equally controlled by both companies. 
On the other hand, ABB Robotics obtains the entire control of 
the robotics division of Renault. 
  The investigation by the European Commission only related to 
the joint venture. The other part [of the deal] has no communal 
dimension, since the turnover does not reach the threshold [40 
million Swiss francs] from which the EU starts controlling 
mergers.

<F P=106> [As received via ANSASERVICE database] </F>
  [Text] Rome (ANSA) 7 Feb 94 -- It is absolutely the least 
polluting automobile engine. The exhaust emissions have been 
reduced by 90 percent with respect to the normal gasoline 
engine. We should already be able to see it in operation on 
delivery vans and buses in two or three years' time, and perhaps 
also on cars. Hydrogen is the fuel "of the next century," and 
the hydrogen engine continues to be one of the technological 
challenges being dealt with by researchers and experts from 
organizations and universities. In Italy, ENEA [National Agency 
for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment] has built a 
prototype of this "green" engine that is fitted with an 
"original" valve to mix the hydrogen with air. It has been 
installed on a Fiat "Ducato" van that has been "entrusted" to 
the University of Pisa for fine tuning. The system has already 
provided its first positive results: no carbon monoxide, 
unburned hydrocarbon, or carbon dioxide emissions. The only 
pollutants produced are nitrous oxides and these are produced in 
smaller quantities than by a gasoline engine. "It is a simple 
internal combustion engine," explains Raffaele Vellone of the 
ENEA, "in which the mixing of hydrogen and air must be perfected 
so that the combinations that give rise to nitrous oxide 
emissions are limited." According to Vellone this objective 
could be attained in the future. "Within three years," he added, 
"in addition to this engine, we will build a prototype `hybrid' 
vehicle, fueled by hydrogen with `fuel cells' that will give 
even better results because it will have an electric engine." 
  Both systems could produce emissions only slightly in excess 
of the limits set by American regulations specifying that from 
1996 buses should not emit more than 0.25 grams of nitrous 
oxides per kilometer. In particular the hybrid system with fuel 
cells could further lower this limit. According to Vellone, 
this coupling of hydrogen and the electric car could result in 
zero emissions if the fuel were produced by renewable energy 
sources. In fact hydrogen can be produced not only from methane 
but also from methyl alcohol, and biomasses, and by electrolysis 
starting from clean sources of energy: Hydroelectricity, solar 
energy, and energy derived from the wind. However, at the 
current state of the technologies, these systems are still too 
expensive. The cost of producing a liter of hydrogen can vary 
from 600 to 1,800 lire, compared with the 400-500 lire of 
methane and the 1,000 lire of gasoline. It is therefore 
preferable to produce hydrogen from methane or fossil energy 
sources. These systems cost less but are more polluting. The 
cost, however, is not the only "flaw" of the hydrogen engine. 
In fact the limited, though not extremely low, range of the 
vehicles (150 kilometers for a fully-loaded Fiat Ducato) is also 
"worrying" the ENEA technicians. Furthermore this fuel has a 
very low density (71 grams per liter compared with the 780 of 
gasoline) and therefore the tanks take up a lot of space. 
  "The first concrete applications of fuel cell vehicles," 
said 
Vellone "are planned for about the year 2000 and they will be 
applied to larger vehicles like delivery vans and buses. If the 
systems are miniaturized then they will also be installed on 
automobiles." Another problem is the lack of hydrogen pipelines 
for the distribution of the fuel. "The volatile nature of this 
fuel," added Vellone, "makes transportation feasible only if the 
piping is perfectly sealed." This problem also concerns other 
countries. A 200-kilometer experimental version has been built 
in Germany. Still abroad, in the United States, the 
gas-hydrogen mixture (the so-called "hythane") has been tested 
and has given positive results in terms of emissions. Although 
it is not "green" like pure hydrogen, this mixture does not 
create refueling problems because of the high percentage of 
methane. The recent results of studies conducted by the 
University of Pisa also confirm that, at present, this is 
possibly the best solution. However, it can be seen that the 
hydrogen engine will be most useful for urban transport. 
Therefore, ENEA advises that the best solution would be a "dual 
fuel" internal combustion engine. In fact the gasoline would be 
reserved for long journeys, while the hydrogen would be used 
solely in the city.

  [Text] Mannesmann Kienzle has recently opened a 
micromechanics center at its factory in Villingen-Schwenningen. 
The company uses the cleanroom to manufacture the silicon-based 
acceleration sensors that it has developed itself, and which are 
designed primarily for use in motor vehicle applications. 
  Mannesmann Kienzle has invested all of 4.5 million German 
marks [DM] to build the new manufacturing center, where 
acceleration sensors are produced using processes similar to 
those involved in the production of electronic devices: 
photolithography, diffusion, and etching. However, the main 
focus here is not on obtaining electrical functions, but on 
setting up mechanical functions on the minutest area. As in the 
manufacture of ICs [integrated circuits], the sensor "chips" are 
fabricated on a wafer, which is processed under cleanroom 
conditions (class 100). One wafer accommodates 99 sensors. The 
micromechanical production plant is designed for a capacity of 
up to 1 million sensors a year. 
  The sensors work as follows: The silicon chip is etched in 
such a way as to create a freely oscillating inert mass 
positioned between, but not touching, two aluminum electrodes. 
The electrodes are mounted on two glass platelets, which are 
fixed together and also constitute the sensor housing. The two 
electrodes and the inert mass between them form a differential 
capacitor. The capacitances of the two capacitors vary 
according to the excursion of the silicon mass. If the sensor 
is now subjected to acceleration, the amount of acceleration can 
be measured from the fluctuations in capacitance. Mannesmann 
Kienzle's main target market is the automobile industry. 
Production Manager Wolfgang Tauser anticipates an annual growth 
rate of about 90 percent for the sensors over the next few years.

<F P=106> [Article by Francois Jeanne: "Language: Object Mechanisms </F>
Enhance New Ada Norm"] 
  [Text] The Ada 9X norm, due for release around the 
end of 1994, includes the object mechanisms it was lacking to 
really compete with a language like C++. Ada's promoters now 
envision a planetary future for it. 
  In step with its upgrades (Ada 83 in 1983, Ada 9X next 
September), the Ada language, invented by the French around the 
end of the 1970s for the DOD (the U.S. Department of Defense), 
has been jogging along in its quiet way. 
  But watch out! This time, urged by its large-scale 
industrial 
users worldwide, its additional features have to do with 
object-oriented programming and enhancement of the language's 
real-time characteristics. Ada thus becomes a serious challenger 
to C++, in the object-oriented language sphere as well as in 
that of real time. 
  After the hopes to which the start of the preceding decade 
had given rise, the Ada market never really took off. Different 
estimating methods put it today in the vicinity of $220 million 
annually (see box). "The fault lies with serious marketing 
problems," says Marie-France Mignon, communications director at 
Alsys. "Ada can be installed only by specialists; and efforts 
aimed at students have been insufficient. We are seeking to 
remedy this situation, since it is they who open the doors for 
us to new accounts where force of habit, indeed lack of 
information, tend to result in the use of C++." 
  C++! Voila their nemesis. Still reluctant to acknowledge it 
though, the extraordinary success Bjorn Soustrup's language 
enjoyed during the 1980s is sufficiently solidly based to rouse 
the passions of Ada's supporters. All precautions were taken 
from the very outset with respect to standardization and 
responses to the needs of users. C++'s gains are all the more 
infuriating in that "historic" Ada clients, specifically the 
defense industries, are gradually surrendering to the fad. 
  The Ada 9X norm project, once accepted (for the moment, it 
is 
being examined by the ISO [International Standards 
Organization]), is expected to respond, at least from the 
technical viewpoint initially, to the advances C++ has achieved. 
"This new edition is in keeping with a contractual requirement 
for a review of Ada every 10 years by the ISO," says Pascal 
Plisson, who heads the defining of Ada products at Alsys. 
  Specifically, Ada 9X will enhance the language in two 
principal directions. Object-oriented programming occupies a 
preponderant place, since Ada will now have more robust 
inheritance capabilities and polymorphisms of execution, two 
essential characteristics for valid support of the object 
archetype. Prototyping tests, which in particular enabled the 
DOD to launch the Ada Gnu product, revealed compaction gains by 
a factor of 5 with respect to the code of certain Booch software 
components (named after the American creator of the method). 
This should greatly improve its reusability and readability 
characteristics. 
  Real-time applications can also be expected to benefit from 
recent work that takes into account asynchronous models through 
the addition of a type of protected codes. Alsys reports gains 
in execution by a factor of 3 during recent prototypings, with 
respect to the so-called "rendezvous" mechanism used in Ada 83. 
  In addition, Ada 9X will now support the 8-bit international 
ASCII character set, which is expected to open the doors of the 
Japanese market a little wider to it. The language is also to be 
further opened to the outside world, possibly giving rise to 
programs written in Fortran and C, for example. 
  And recent disclosures indicate that, upon submitting 
application for certification, each supplier will be asked to 
choose an applicative option. The choices offered will be: 
parallel processing, scientific computing, or distributed 
systems. "Approximately 90 percent of the kernel of a compiler 
will be common to all; the remaining 10 percent will depend on 
the option chosen by the supplier," says Pascal Plisson. 
<H5>  9X Products Beginning in 1994 </H5>
  Alsys plans to launch a first product under the new norm 
around the beginning of 1994. Verdix prefers to more cautiously 
await a justification of this shift, based on demand by clients 
loyal to Ada (generally speaking, Americans, who are very 
sensitive to the recommendations of the DOD). "We do not want to 
run the risk of disappointing them with products that may lack 
sufficient robustness," says its director for Europe, Olivier 
Roubine. The strategy that Verdix (Vadspro line) and its new 
partner Rational (Apex, under UNIX) intend to follow will be to 
provide real-time extensions to their compilers, beginning in 
the second quarter of 1994, and object-language extensions in 
the third quarter. 
  The 9X movement, and Ada's intent to offer C++ serious 
competition within two years from now, can nevertheless be 
deemed to be already under way. A study by French consultant 
Jean-Francois Guenon forecasts that by 1995 these two languages 
will clearly dominate the world of real time, to the detriment 
of C. It remains to be seen whether the promoters of Ada will be 
able to impose their language on the computer community as a 
whole. Nothing is less certain. The DOD, of course, has 
committed several million dollars to promote Ada. But there is a 
possibility that this effort may not reach beyond a clientele 
consisting of big industrial and defense accounts that are 
already users of the language. Alsys, which makes no secret of 
its militancy in favor of the Ada cause, has decided to market 
Proada compilers under Windows at less than 5,000 French francs 
[Fr], around mid-1994. 
  But essentially, the suppliers' rationale revolves around 
the 
problems of development. "Ada has always sought to incorporate 
the leading software engineering ideas of its time," says Pascal 
Plisson, adding by way of further clarification, "Ada is not the 
largest of the existing compilers. It is the smallest software 
development environment." 
  Rational, with its Rose environment, and Alsys, having taken 
over the activities of IGL Technology, a Thomson subsidiary 
specializing in software engineering, have made no secret of 
their intent to rapidly attain critical mass, no longer in the 
Ada market (where the two groups represent close to 50 percent 
of the market), but rather in the software engineering market. 
And with a telling argument: "Particularly in the real-time 
domain, our products offer already integrated development 
facilities, while the vendors of C and C++ computers position 
themselves in this market mainly as sellers of accessory tools 
for refurbishing a workshop," says Marc Richard-Foy, who heads 
pre-sale activities at Alsys. 
  It remains to be seen whether this integrative and, on the 
whole, globalizing rationale will not penalize Ada 9X as 
compared with the supposed flexibility of use of a C++ compiler. 
The trend does not yet favor Ada 9X, which, in particular, has 
not managed to penetrate the small and medium-sized enterprises 
sector. The suppliers are hoping not to regret, some few years 
hence, not having dared to name Ada's new upgrade Ada++. 
<H5>  [Box]: Still a Confidential Market </H5>
  Worth only $220 million annually, the Ada world market is 
dominated by the two recently formed groups: on the one hand, 
Rational and Verdix; and on the other, Alsys and Telesoft. The 
first of these groups today accounts for around $65 million of 
the market, and the second for around $50 million. 
  These two entities have incontestably far outdistanced their 
immediate pursuers: Tartan, DCC, and especially DEC, which 
mainly sell compilers. But in addition to their size, they are 
also characterized by their interesting positioning in the world 
software engineering market, where they easily rank among the 
top 10, and where they are pitted against the more generalist 
development environments of Cadre (Teamwork) and IDE (Software 
Through Pictures).

<F P=106> [Article by P. D.: "Olivetti Prepares Multimedia Line"] </F>
  [Text] Olivetti plans to take advantage of the IT Forum 
show to launch a line of multimedia PC's designed primarily for 
the general consumer market, as well as a communicating PC 
equipped with an integrated videoconferencing system. Two 
principal models of the "Domus Life" line will be on the market 
during the first quarter of 1994, in ready-to-use configurations. 
  The PCS Television integrates a video card and tuner, and 
includes loudspeakers. The user can thus view television on the 
entire screen or in a Windows window, but can also capture 
images and construct video montages with the aid of the software 
provided. 
  The PCS Educator offers a 16-bit Pro Audio Spectrum sound 
card, a single-speed multisession CD-ROM reader, loudspeakers, 
and a number of applications on CD-ROM. 
  After a good takeoff in low-priced PC's for the mass market, 
but devoid of configurations aimed at the general public, 
Olivetti is supplementing its line with more sophisticated 
products capable of providing a real dimension of entertainment 
and education. Vis-a-vis Compaq and IBM, therefore, Olivetti's 
product line will now include, on the one hand, cheaper 
machines, and on the other, more complete and innovative models.

<F P=106> [Article by Claire Remi: "HOOD Object-Oriented Programming </F>
Method"] 
  [Text] HOOD is an object-oriented programming method 
designed for project managers, quality control executives, and 
programmers involved in major real or time-shared projects. 
Prior knowledge of the application field has proved to be 
essential for learning the method. 
  In the footsteps of the Ada language and of major military, 
aeronautics and space programs, object-oriented methods of 
analysis or programming have undergone extensive development. 
The HOOD method (Hierarchical Object-Oriented Design), which is 
today one of the programming standards with Merise and Sadt, was 
conceived in 1987 in response to an international call for 
proposals from ESA (European Space Agency). The solution 
proposed by a consortium composed of Cisi Ingenierie, Matra 
Espace, and CRI, was the one selected. HOOD, adopted by most 
European software development projects for aeronautics and 
space, is now expanding throughout all sectors of industry. 
CNES, CEA, GDF, CNET, Dassault Systemes are among its users, as 
well as universities (Toulouse, Pisa in Italy, and so on). 
  After years of successive use and updates, HOOD is now full 
grown with version 3.1. It has become a complete text and 
graphic method for guiding design through its stages; it 
specifies related documents, takes into account the dynamic 
factors of applications, supports the development of distributed 
systems, and allows direct and reversible linkage to the 
produced code. It makes it possible to represent a system as a 
hierarchy of objects. As explained by OPL, a computer consulting 
firm, "this combination (hierarchical design and the notion of 
object), is the very heart of the method and makes it possible 
to combine the most modern techniques (object-oriented design) 
with industry requirements (subcontracts, validation of 
integration, and so on)." A HOOD-designed system can be 
implemented in classic languages like Ada or C, in 
object-oriented languages like C++, or in reactive languages 
like Esterel or Electre. 
<H5>  Method Calls for Rules and Modeling </H5>
  The goal of HOOD training is to learn to make efficient use 
of the method while avoiding its traps; to ensure linking 
between design and programming; to integrate both real time 
constraints at the design stage, and distributed system problems 
at the design level; and to identify and learn to use the 
available development environments. This training usually 
includes an introductory component to object-oriented design. 
Jean-Pierre Rosen (Adalog) explains that "HOOD is a complete 
method requiring two features: rules, and modeling. With the 
many tools available on the market, the rules of the method can 
be checked. On the other hand, there is no way to automate 
modeling. It is therefore important to complete the course with 
examples stressing the modeling component." 
  The HOOD method is often presented as part of more general 
training courses on object-oriented analysis and design which 
include other methods (Booch, Shlaer &amp; Mellor, Coad &amp; 
Yourdon, 
and so on), or in courses on the object approach, as is the case 
with courses offered by Cap Sesa Institute. These training 
courses are designed for those in charge of real-time 
development who are looking for a method suited to their needs; 
they are also designed for new HOOD users who want a clear 
presentation of the method before tackling their development; 
and they are designed for HOOD tool users aware that a sound 
basic methodology is essential, as well as for quality control 
managers wanting to acquire a good grasp of the method. The 
Ada/HOOD course offered by Adalog concentrates on the 
relationship between method and language; it makes it possible 
for quality control managers, certification agencies, and 
maintenance staffs to become qualified to check and correct 
applications developed in Ada using the HOOD method. 
<H5>  "Correct Positioning of the Method Within the Software's </H5>
Life Cycle" 
  According to Michel Lai, director of Methods Quality Control 
and in charge of object-oriented methods at Ingenia, "the HOOD 
method fits within industrial efforts aimed at incorporating 
software technologies, and within measures toward quality 
assurance and control. The HOOD method is intended for engineers 
already experienced in the profession and in the application 
field that concern them. It is a downward hierarchy method 
aiming to establish relationships between modules so as to 
construct a software architecture. It is a tool for expressing 
computer solutions within a logical and physical model. As with 
any method, in the absence of a solid understanding, it is 
possible to interpret a description based on boxes and arrows, 
by distorting the process. It is necessary to correctly position 
the method within the life cycle of the software: the HOOD 
method concerns software design and the early stage of coding; 
it deals only lightly with the analytic phase and not at all 
with specification aspects. This positioning helps avoid 
erroneous interpretations."

Infotechnology"] 
  [Text] The Cabinet has decided to support the High 
Performance Computing and Networking (HPCN) project with the sum 
of 35 million Dutch guilders. HPCN looks at new information 
technology for, among others, industrial, commercial and 
scientific purposes. The project is researching into such 
possibilities as fast processing of television images, quicker 
processing by banks of payment requests, and an increase in 
production quality, while machines will be controlled faster by 
parallel processing (image processing and control). 
  It is expected that the use of HPCN will improve performance 
in the field of information streams by a factor of 1,000. The 
new technology could have great significance for the 
reinforcement of both the knowledge infrastructure and the 
economic structure. With HPCN, the processors do not work 
sequentially -- as they do in traditional computers -- but 
parallel. This requires a different hardware construction, the 
peripheral equipment needs to be adapted, and other network 
connections have to be used. 
<H5>  HPCN Centers </H5>
  The Interdepartmental Commission for Economic Structure 
Support (ICES) has recommended the HPCN project for subsidies to 
the ministries of Economic Affairs and of Education and Science. 
ICES assumes that with this financial injection the Netherlands 
can become one of the six future European HPCN centers. 
  Both commercial and scientific institutions have already 
expressed their wish to collaborate on the development of HPCN. 
ICES has, however, named as a specific condition for receipt of 
subsidies the involvement in the project of medium-sized 
enterprises and research institutions. Furthermore, no HPCN 
institute will be created. The participants will set up an 
R&amp;D 
infrastructure, through which participants in the project can be 
interconnected via networks.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Brevel Development </F>
Continuing"] 
  [Text] The French-German economic interest group Eurodrone 
is beginning tests on the subsystems for the Brevel 
reconnaissance drone whose development of these two promoter 
countries for the armed forces should be completed by the end of 
1998. 
  Eurodrone, a joint subsidiary of Matra Defense (France) and 
Systemtechnik Nord (Germany), received an order from the French 
and German governments in the amount of Fr450 million for the 
second increment involved in the development of the new 
surveillance system using Brevel drones. Designed to meet the 
operational requirements of the French and German armed forces, 
Brevel has been in the works since October 1992 as part of a 
program spread out over six years based on an overall 
development contract of Fr1.4 billion (DM400 million). 
  According to Eurodrone, the development program's first year 
made it possible to install all the facilities needed for 
program implementation through continuous cooperation fostered 
for many long years between the two countries in the armament 
field; here, Matra Defense is also cooperating with Deutsche 
Aerospace in building the new Apache cruise missile which, among 
other things, is earmarked for the Tornado aircraft of the 
German Air Force (cf., A&amp;C, No. 1451). 
  STN [Systemtechnik Nord] and Matra, for their part, already 
finished "several technically very ambitious subassemblies" (but 
not yet finalized) for the drone and they began testing these 
first elements of the Brevel. This, however, is but the 
beginning of the program which will thus basically run until 
1998. 
  As we recall, Brevel is an observation system based on small 
(pilotless) drones equipped with an infrared camera that permits 
both day-time and night-time observation of the overflight zone 
whose image can be transmitted in real time (via "data link") to 
the image receiving and processing station. This station 
furthermore controls small furtive drones that can fly for 
several hours at a speed of 150 km/hr and reach an operational 
altitude of about 2,000 m. Eurodrone also emphasized that "the 
current political situation in Europe calls for equipment to be 
used in crisis control, especially surveillance systems, in 
order to supply the civilian and military authorities with the 
kind of information that is indispensable for decision-making." 
The French-German firm thinks that "Brevel is best suited for 
accomplishing this mission by virtue of its discretion and its 
resistance to any form of jamming and due to the fact that it is 
remote-controlled." 
  The usefulness of drones, as a matter of fact, has been 
constantly demonstrated these past years, both in combat and 
during times of crisis or civil war. Following the 
demonstrations made by the American drones during the Gulf War, 
the usefulness of these "pilotless aircraft" has been confirmed 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, when the United Nations forces used the 
small Fox drones made by the French company CAC Systeme (cf., 
A&amp;C, No. 1450).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article entitled: "The FLA Transport Plane </F>
Runs Into Financing Difficulties"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] A parliamentary report highlights the troubles of 
the military transport aircraft (FLA) program, and proposes 
original financial and industrial solutions for its success. 
  Original reports are a specialty of Var deputy Arthur 
Paecht. 
Once again, the reporter for the National Assembly's Finance 
Committee has shaken the defense and aeronautics world by 
presenting a thorough and highly original report on "financing 
the European military transport plane," aka the FLA (future 
large aircraft) program. Besides providing a superb technical 
description of the project and its alternatives (see AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No 1447), the document 
analyzes the problems inherent in the program and, most 
important, offers original financial and industrial solutions to 
insure its success. The project is estimated to cost between 188 
and 248 billion French francs [Fr] for 354 aircraft over 15 
years. France alone, which reportedly has a 17.8 percent share 
in the program, will spend between Fr33.1 and 43.5 billion. 
  Consequently, the difficulty of finding funds in the 
shrinking military budgets (see table) of most of our European 
partners threatens the program's credibility. Some of them -- 
such as Great Britain, which is tempted to go with the American 
C-130J -- are not fervent supporters of the FLA. Hence the 
recommendations in Arthur Paecht's report. 
  The first proposal calls for drastic cuts in the cost of 
developing and mass manufacturing the European aircraft. The Var 
deputy has calculated that paring the cargo's specifications 
just slightly and optimizing the program's industrial 
organization would cut development costs 34.6 percent, to about 
Fr26 billion instead of Fr36 billion. This would also reduce the 
per unit "flyaway" cost 22 percent, to about Fr380 million. 
Suggested retrenchments include lowering operational 
specifications, by shortening the hold 2 meters (-4 percent) and 
slowing peak speed at low altitudes by 50 kt (-3 percent). Those 
two modifications would save about 12.6 percent. A different 
engine (propellor or THR instead of a jet) would trim 10 
percent, and improved industrial organization another 12 percent. 
  Many think the real key to the FLA program's success is an 
industrial or state organization that can insure good 
management. The Paecht report recommends "very lean and more 
efficient than usual state management," with "industrial 
management that is at least on par with Airbus's." It also 
recommends that "the aircraft's manufacturing design be based on 
the armed forces' stated needs, using an essentially economic 
approach." Such a strategy would involve a major shakeup in the 
way weapons programs are managed in France, and "could call into 
question the DGA's [General Weapons Delegation] role in this 
type of program." 
  Thus, given the large number of participating countries 
(eight), the report recommends that Airbus Industrie or an ad 
hoc consortium modeled after it take the management lead. 
Moreover, to ensure tight technical control, the document talks 
about "a leadership team involving just two or three countries" 
and including a strong Franco-German axis. The other countries 
would be involved as manufacturing partners. 
  The difficulty of the final problem -- how to scare up 
financing for the FLA -- has cast doubts on its future. The 
Germans have suggested that the companies provide the funds, 
which armed forces budgets can no longer do (unless those 
budgets are increased two percent or unless one or more weapons 
programs are eliminated). Arthur Paecht is asking governments to 
show more imagination. He has proposed original solutions that 
combine the use of corporate equity (backed by government 
purchase pledges), private capital, budget funds, and schemes 
analogous to the reimbursible loans of the civil construction 
industry. 
  Another pervasive theme in the Paecht report is the 
program's 
industrial fallout in Europe and France. The construction of an 
estimated 300 to 350 aircraft is the financial and industrial 
equivalent of 500 Airbuses, and will create something like 
20,000 industrial jobs in Europe over 15 years. "For France 
alone, about 4,000 jobs are at stake over the same period," the 
reporter calculates. Manufacture of the 1,500 engines -- not to 
mention the engineers and technicians needed to design the new 
model -- will create an equal number of positions over 10 years. 
When the FLA's estimated potential market of 700 aircraft is 
factored in, the number of highly-skilled jobs that are on the 
line is obvious. 
  But more important, in the eyes of the reporter, than direct 
job creation is the FLA's capacity to keep the expertise of 
European design and engineering departments alive. Indeed, once 
the A330/340 programs are complete, those departments have 
little in the way of new projects for at least 10 years. 
Consequently, the FLA program "could prove vitally important to 
aeronautics industries." 
  Finally, the report stresses the value of the program in 
fostering European defense collaboration. The FLA program fits 
perfectly within the framework of a joint European defense 
policy, consolidated by the WEU and the Franco-German Weapons 
Agency, for which it could serve as the impetus. The FLA is even 
described as an "emblematic" program, whose failure would signal 
the defeat of "any attempt to put together a European defense 
policy on weapons."

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "Exclusive Rafale Report: </F>
What Flight Tests Revealed; the New MICA and Apache Missiles; 
and Electronic Countermeasures"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] Despite the budget-imposed slowdown in testing, the 
Rafale program is moving ahead with development of the 
multitarget electron-scanning radar, RBE2; SPECTRA 
countermeasures; and Rafale weapons that include new-generation 
MICA missiles and an Apache cruise missile. 
  The decision to place the aircraft carrier Foch on alert 
status has interrupted sea testing of the Rafale M01 and M02. 
Plans had called for catapult launches and decklandings of heavy 
configuration aircraft in maneuvers similar to those begun at 
the Lakehurst base in the United States (see AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No. 1455). A 
demonstration to Fleet Air Arm personnel of the Rafale's good 
maintainability was also scheduled. The two prototypes did 
manage to complete 10 catapult launches and decklandings before 
the time out was called. 
  The testing reschedule will force program officials to 
revise 
the fighter's development timetable. Earlier plans had called 
for a half-year halt in the M01 prototype's development after 
completion of sea testing on the Foch at month's end, to comply 
with the government's decision to delay the Rafale's operational 
start-of-service date by six months. Barring any new changes 
brought about by the next military appropriations bill, the Air 
Force does not expect to take delivery of the first production 
Rafale (a "B") until late summer of 1997. The Fleet Air Arm will 
receive a Rafale M in early 1998 and should have a fleet up and 
running by mid-1999. 
  The government officially proposed putting the brakes on the 
Rafale program for budget reasons when it presented its draft 
budget to Parliament. That bill eliminated 2 billion French 
francs [Fr] in appropriations that had been slated for the 
program as a whole in 1994. Industrialization and mass 
production phases have been stretched out, and development work 
slowed, as a result. 
  Work to research, prepare, and fabricate production tools 
will be staggered, as will the study and manufacture of the 
assembly-line test benches needed to industrialize equipment 
such as flight control systems. 
  The manufacture of production aircraft and associated 
equipment will also be spread out over a longer period. SNECMA 
will deliver just one engine in 1996, instead of the eight 
originally planned, followed by another 11 in 1997. 
  In terms of development work, officials have agreed to delay 
the flight of the M01 prototype for six months, as soon as the 
round of sea testing is over. Moreover, the appropriations' cut 
will make it impossible to conduct all the research and test 
work to integrate equipment and weapons that had been planned 
for this year. This directly affects development of the 
navigation and attack system, including the RBE2. The Rafale A 
demonstrator, which made its maiden flight in July, 1986, 
completed its flights last month after effecting a total of 867 
test missions. 
  Despite the delay--which is more financially than 
technically 
motivated--Rafale has not lost its lead over European rivals. It 
is still ahead of both the Eurofighter 2000, grounded for 
fly-by-wire control problems, and Saab's JAS-39 Gripen, which 
was first flummoxed by similiar bugs in its fly-by-wire control 
system and is now unable to fly because its RM12 engine lost 
compressor blades. The four French prototypes are flying, 
including the last two (B02 and M02), which made their maiden 
flights in the first half of 1993. 
  The Rafale program made several major strides in 1993, 
including the completion of three Navy Rafale test rounds (two 
in the U.S. and one on the Foch aircraft carrier). Essential 
technical milestones included the firing of Giat Industries 
30-mm M791 gun; the first launch of Matra's Magic II 
self-defense air-to-air missile on 26 March; and the first 
flight of Thomson-CSF's and Dassault Electronique's RBE2 
electron-scanning radar aboard a Rafale B01 on 7 July. In 
addition, the program's static test cell completed its first 
phase of endurance tests--involving the equivalent of 10,000 
flight hours, 3,000 catapult launches, and 3,000 
decklandings--at the Toulouse Aeronautical Test Center [CEAT]. 
  This year the Rafale program will concentrate on continued 
testing of weapons systems and of the navigation and attack 
system (NAS). The trials will be conducted on both the Rafale 
B01 and M01, and on aircraft of the Flight Test Center (see 
boxed material). The NAS is built around two Sagem Sigma RL 90 
gyrolaser inertial units, plus a Dassault Electronique mission 
computer that employs new technologies such as RISC (reduced 
instruction set computer) processors and ASIC (application 
specific integrated circuit) components. To allow for even more 
precise navigation, the NAS is equipped with a GPS receiver 
(incorporating a Sextant avionics receiver) for satellite 
navigation, a laser telemeter, and a Thomson-CSF AHV 17 digital 
radio-altimeter that can also correlate with the computer data 
of a digitized terrain. Finally, engineers will continue testing 
of the RBE2 electron-scanning radar, and begin trials involving 
SPECTRA electronic countermeasures and Sextant 
Avionique/Intertechnique's helmet-mounted sight. The latter is a 
real sight that displays flight and attack symbols to the pilot, 
enabling him/her to designate targets automatically with a 
simple motion of the head. 
  Acceptance flights for Thomson-CSF's protected 
radiocommunications system will also continue. The Saturn 
(Second Generation Antijam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO) is still 
compatible with current "Have Quick II" devices, despite its use 
of very fast frequency-evasion and coding techniques. The same 
manufacturer is also developing classic V/UHFs, a new Tacan NC 
12E, and a new TLS 2000 approach and landing-assistance unit 
that incorporates ILS/MLS and VOR/DME functions. 
  Weapons will be an important part of test runs. The Rafale's 
14 carry mounts (13 for the Navy version) will initially enable 
it to carry 6 metric tons of external load, a figure that will 
increase to 8 for the last standards. Five of the mounts are 
considered "wet"; that is, they can hold additional 1,250 or 
2,000 liter tanks. Rafale's weaponry will gradually be put into 
service in accordance with the fighter's standards. The first, 
so-called SU0 "air-to-air" standard (user standard 0) involves a 
mix of Magic II and Mica (electromagnetic version) missiles, 
plus 1,250 and 2,000 liter tanks in three configurations. The 
second "SU1" standard features the previous configurations plus 
five new ones: three "air-to-air" configurations employing 
infrared Mica missiles instead of Magics (with electromagnetic 
versions under the fuselage and wing unit as well); and two 
"air-to-surface" configurations featuring AS 30 L laser-guided 
missiles (including a laser-designation nacelle) or Apache 
cruise missiles. The final "SU2" standard involves a new 
"air-to-air" configuration (interchangeable infrared or 
electromagnetic Micas) and several "air-to-surface" ones that 
include an array of classic bombs, laser-guided bombs (LGB), and 
ASMP nuclear missiles or their successor. 
<H5>  Boxed Material: Over 1,560 Flight Hours for the M88 Engines </H5>
  Development of the Rafale engine is proceeding on time and 
within costs. Everyone involved in the program--collaborating 
manufacturers, official departments, and user armies--agrees 
that the motors are performing as expected. To date, nine 
development and 13 aircraft engines have logged in more than 
6,800 hours of operation. 
  The program's 13 "flight-worthy" engines have racked up over 
1,560 hours of flight, nearly 500 of them with afterburning. 
"With two years to go before final qualification, these results 
show the maturity and availability of the M88," says Jean 
Mossot, the program's director at SNECMA. Since the 1992 
qualification test (the so-called "T" trial) that showed the 
engine was already performing very close to specifications, 
several improvements have been made to the M88. The first is the 
development of an anti-icing (as opposed to de-icing) and 
corresponding control system on the inlet guide blade of the 
adjustable, low-pressure compressor. The system automatically 
regulates an air bleed blade that opens and closes as a function 
of engine speed and air temperature. Tests on the CEPr (the 
DGA's powerplant test center in Saclay) icing bench have 
established its programming law. It is very important that the 
Rafale have an engine with an adjustable inlet guide blade. By 
regulating the air intake as a function of engine speed and 
aircraft incidence, the guide blade boosts pumping margins, 
enabling the M88 intakes to more easily absorb the enormous air 
distortions created by Rafale's rapid travel. 
  Another enhancement involved substituting the composite 
material PMR15 for the titanium used to make the cold duct (that 
is, the engine's outer envelope). Engine weight dropped 4 kilos, 
and 50 hours of endurance tests and flight 
experiments--including an aircraft simulation campaign that 
involved 50 simulated catapult launches and 
decklandings--demonstrated that the duct's performance was 
excellent. Engineers are now thinking about eliminating the 
large vent line of the intershaft ventilation system, also to 
trim engine weight and manufacturing costs. The long tube, which 
runs the entire outside length of the PC channel, would be 
replaced by a duct running directly into the PC channel. 
  The other improvements underway have to do with afterburning 
(3-percent increase in efficiency) and control of the engine, 
which is in final development phases. Redundant full-authority 
digital engine control (FADEC) optimizes engine regulation 
without pilot intervention and handles maintenance tasks. 
  Finally, technicians are still running endurance and aging 
tests to validate life and reliabiilty projections. Scheduled 
for completion before the qualification that will conclude the 
M88's development phase (late 1995), the tests will include a 
sand ingestion trial, a 700-hour endurance test conducted by 
Techspace Aero, and a 150-hour endurance test in a high-altitude 
simulator. Moreover, Jean Mossot's team must also devise methods 
for assessing various engine risks such as compressor stalling 
and chamber or afterburner shutdown. These are needed to cover 
the operation of an "extreme" engine, should the mass 
manufacturing under preparation produce one. 
  Indeed, SNECMA has already received an initial order for 
eight mass-produced engines, the first of which will be 
delivered in December 1996. The enginemaker is putting together 
initial industrialization contracts, readying supplies for long 
cycles, and conducting its first discussions with suppliers. At 
the same time, it is drafting a production plan to select SNECMA 
plants and subcontractors and establish a quality-control scheme 
based on the new concept of "concurrent engineering." 
<H5>  Boxed Material: CEV's Four Flying Test Benches </H5>
  Development of the Rafale and its weapons system is a major 
activity for the General Weapons Delegation's Flight Test Center 
(CEV). The program requires a permanent fleet of four flying 
test benches, a fleet of 10 other utility craft, new playback 
and flight path analysis devices, and several simulators. It 
also utilizes dozens of highly-skilled specialists (mechanical, 
computer, and electronics engineers), who, in just a few hours, 
can set up a complex rig on an aircraft or fix a programming 
bug. CEV, which is headed by general engineer Herve Groualle, 
has spent 20 to 25 percent of its time on the Rafale since 
testing of the fighter began. 
  The four Rafale prototypes now flying will log in 
approximately 2,450 missions before development of the fighter 
and its weapons systems is complete. Over 2,000 of those 
missions will be test flights, including 190 inspection flights 
made by official departments and 175 by the two user branches of 
the armed forces. Prototype test flights are meant to help 
develop the platform and check its flight qualities (25 percent 
of flights), navigation and attack system (56 percent of 
flights), and various mounts and weapons/tank separation (19 
percent of flights). Finally, additional flights (800 or so) 
will be performed to develop the M88-2 engines and the Mica and 
Apache missiles weapons. 
  Together with the 2,450 test missions, most of which will be 
flown by Dassault-Aviation test pilots, the CEV will make nearly 
5,000 other flights on its own aircraft. Over 2,000 will be 
aimed at fine tuning weapons system equipment; another 2,800 
will be classified as "ancillary" flights. "Decoy" aircraft, for 
instance, will be set up to check the multitarget capability of 
the RBE2 radar, and acceptance flights will be made for small 
pieces of equipment such as the radio, GPS navigation, or 
digital links. 
  To develop the weapons system that constitutes the bulk of 
the Rafale program (the RBE2 radar and SPECTRA defense system), 
CEV has four specially-altered airplanes. Indeed, engineers had 
to add a Mil-Std 1553 (Rafale standard) bus to the digibus 
(Mirage 2000 standard) of these aircraft, which consist of three 
Mystere 20s and a Mirage 2000B each of which averages 80 flights 
a year. SPECTRA will be developed on the M02 prototype. But 
before that, the CEV will try it out on a Mystere 20 that will 
fly in 1994, once the SPECTRA system now on a CEV integration 
bench in Bretigny is ready. The other equipment, notably the 
three RBE2 radars, is already flying on two other Mystere 20s 
and a Mirage 2000B. A new Mirage 2000B, nicknamed "Bob" (a 
two-seater, optronic bench), is being put into service to test 
FSO (front sector optronics) components. Its flights compliment 
those of another Mystere 20 that has been specially equipped to 
conduct optronics research. 
  All these test flights aim to develop equipment and 
software. 
In the case of the radar, for instance, they verify that the 
sensor operates properly and that signal processing is accurate. 
The flights also validate such essential functions as air-to-air 
tracking, telemetry, navigation, and guidance, as well as the 
identification and memory storage of databases, such as those 
containing navigational terrain pictures. 
  Finally, CEV has eight other aircraft in service to develop 
weaponry. They are: one Mystere 20 and two Mirage 2000s to 
develop Micas, and five others to develop the Apache cruise 
missile; a Puma (radar resetting); an AlphaJet (TRI 60 engine); 
a Mystere 20 (radioaltimeter); a Mirage 2000 (engine and fuel); 
and a 2000N for separation and firing tests. 
  But in addition to aircraft, the Center employs three test 
facilities in its work. Bretigny houses the flying test benches; 
Istres features the four Rafales and the simulation benches that 
are vital to preparing complex trials and "playing back" 
flights; and Cazaux hosts the weapons tests. All these 
facilities had to modernize their test rigs and acquire new ones 
to adapt to the Rafale. Remote sensing is now coded (it used to 
be possible to pick up aircraft display images on your TV set!), 
and the aircraft have high-density Schlumberger recorders used 
by NASA for its shuttles. Likewise, more powerful flight path 
analysis devices are being installed. One based on differential 
GPS and a multistate system can monitor the flight paths of 
several moving objects. Finally, CEV is also renovating its 
equipment for monitoring radar and infrared signatures. It will 
be putting into service Dassault Electronique's "Hyper Brahms" 
system--a more refined version of the current Brahms system for 
measuring RCS (radar cross section)--as well as the CSEE's and 
Steria's "Hyper Cerbere" for measuring infrared signature.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean Dupont: "Rafale's Mission Equipment Begins </F>
to Take Shape"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION 
MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] The No. 5 RBE2 and No. 1 SPECTRA countermeasures 
prototypes have just been delivered. The Front Sector Optronics 
will not fly until 1996. 
  As of February, 1994, all the equipment that is part of the 
Rafale SU0 user standard now exists as a prototype. All except 
for the IFF (Identification Friend and Foe) 
interrogator/responder, which has experienced delays. State 
agencies waited until the 11th hour for NATO to define the 
future NIS (NATO Identification System) friend/foe 
identification standard, so that the Rafale would be 
interoperable with the next generation of allied force equipment 
as soon as it goes into service. 
  But by late 1992, alliance member states had not reached a 
consensus on the NIS standard, and the General Weapons 
Delegation (DGA) decided to launch the equipment based on the 
IFF Mk XII standard. The latter can interrogate and identify in 
"secure" encrypted modes, but does not offer the jamming 
resistance or frequency-hopping ability the NIS promises. 
Thomson-CSF (CNI division) has been selected to develop the 
equipment, and plans to deliver the first prototype by the end 
of the year. 
  The system settled on, however, will still constitute a 
significant innovation with its totally new pair of antennas 
shaped like a section of the system's front cone. The choice of 
electron-scanning for the Rafale's radar antenna makes such a 
configuration necessary. 
  Development of the RBE2 (2-plane Electron-Scanning Radar) 
was 
awarded to Thomson-CSF (RCM division) and Dassault Electronique 
in April 1989. Official departments recently accepted the fifth 
RBE2 prototype, out of a total of 10 to be delivered as part of 
the development program. The radar's equipment design has been 
frozen since the fourth prototype. The first four prototypes are 
taking turns participating in the flight tests that began in 
July, 1992, on a Mystere 20 belonging to CEV (Flight Test 
Center). Since then, the RBE2s have logged in some 30 hours of 
flight, including 20 on the Mystere 20, 10 on Rafale (B01 since 
last July, and M02 now), and three outings on a Mirage 2000 test 
bench. This may not seem like much next to the nearly 2,000 
flight hours the RBE2 qualification program will rack up by 1998. 
  [But], say Rafale program officials at the DGA, "The small 
number of flight hours proves that the radar works well." 
Elements verified to date--essentially the proper functioning of 
ancillary equipment and the radar's raw performances (such as 
the measurement of air-to-air range on a calibrated 
target)--have not presented CEV experimenters with any 
unpleasant surprises. However, following catapult launches at 
the Patuxent River base in the United States, program engineers 
decided to reinforce the radar's carrier structure. The decision 
did not affect plans for industrialization, which should begin 
toward the middle of this year. 
  Test flights of the radar are scheduled to be stepped up 
very 
gradually, explains the DGA, as tracking algorithms, electronic 
countermeasures, and new possibilities offered by the antenna's 
design develop. Indeed, the radar's electron scanning operating 
modes can be changed instantaneously, and even intertwined, 
which will generate both huge signal flows for analysis and an 
equal number of algorithms for comparison with real flights. 
  Rather surprisingly, these tests will culminate in 1997-98, 
after the Rafale (and its radar) goes into service in the Navy. 
There is a good reason for this, namely, the fact that the 
operating modes which generate the most data, and consequently 
require the most flight hours, are air-to-surface modes. That 
is, the modes that are of greatest interest to the Air Force. 
  SPECTRA (Rafale Fire-Control Protection and Avoidance 
System) 
mission equipment follows the radar in the Rafale integration 
plan. Development of the first countermeasures system to be 
entirely (including chaff-launchers) borne inside a French 
airplane got underway in March, 1990, at three subcontractors: 
Thomson-CSF, Dassault Electronique, and Matra Defense. 
  SPECTRA is at a turning point in its development program, 
now 
that its first prototype is undergoing acceptance tests at 
Thomson-CSF's Bretigny sur Orge Flight Test Center in a Paris 
suburb. These trials are significant, for SPECTRA will have to 
be able to process all electromagnetic spectrum bands, from air 
defense radars to the millimetric or infrared homing heads of 
anti-air missiles and the laser signals of so-called "beam 
rider" missile fire control systems. In addition, SPECTRA will 
have to be able to selectively jam several transmitters 
simultaneously. 
  When ground tests are complete, SPECTRA will be ready for a 
first test flight scheduled for next summer. Mass production of 
the system will not begin until after the results of the first 
flights are analyzed. 
  Meanwhile, SPECTRA component devices have been showing up, 
one after the other, on the fuselage of various Rafale 
prototypes. Atop the tail fin, for instance, a fairing sports 
one antenna pointed forward and another toward the rear; two 
MDDs (SAT-made Missile Departure Detectors) on either side; and 
an LAD (Laser Alert Detector made by Thomson-TRT-Defense) that 
covers the aft of the airplane. Two other LADs will also be 
mounted in the front of the fuselage. Four antennas are now 
visible, two at the canard roots and two under the engine air 
intakes. Equipped with solid-state transmitters, the antennas 
constitute a phase array that can channel jamming into a narrow 
cone, making it more efficient than transmissions via the fixed 
aerial of current-generation jammers. 
  The DGA is shortly expected to launch a program dubbed 
Electronic Warfare Programming System (EWPS), concurrently with 
SPECTRA. The EWPS is a ground device that will tune SPECTRA's 
modes and operating sequences, and select them during mission 
preparation based on the specific radar threats the aircraft is 
likely to encounter. The program will aim to establish a 
database on the effectiveness of countermeasures; generate 
mission preparation libraries; and validate those libraries 
through digital or hybrid simulations. 
  As for the Front Sector Optronics (FSO), the two partners in 
charge of the program, Thomson-TRT-Defense (TTD) and SAT, are 
working on it at their facilities. Development of the FSO got 
underway in May 1992; the system is expected to go into service 
around 2000 with the Rafale's SU2 standard. 
  The two manufacturer subcontractors are studying how to 
integrate the FSO into the aircraft's other radar sensors and 
countermeasures. (SAT is handling watch and infrared detection 
functions; TTD is in charge of laser telemetry, TV imagery, and 
the electronics unit). After acceptance of the first prototypes, 
scheduled for 1996, the FSO will make its first flight tests.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Rafale's Weaponry Will Be </F>
Formidable"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION 
MAGAZINE 
INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] The French fighter will have a vast panoply of 
weapons, including Matra's new Mica air-to-air multitarget and 
Apache air-to-surface missiles. Flight tests for the Mica and 
Apache will be stepped up in 1994. 
  The Rafale's impressive array of weapons--gun, rocketry, 
bombs, and missiles of all sorts--will make it one of the most 
formidable fighter aircraft of its generation for all air-to-air 
and air-to-surface missions (see AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION 
MAGAZINE 
INTERNATIONAL No. 1360 and 1408). 
  The Rafale will be able to neutralize a 1,000-square-meter 
area using submunitions dropped by Matra's Belouga missile, or 
destroy an airfield landing strip by studding it with 
40-square-meter craters using Thomson Brandt Armements' (TBA) 
BAP 100 antirunway bombs. It will also be able to use the Exocet 
AM-39 to attack a ship 50 to 70 km away. Aerospatiale's Exocet 
will be able to scuttle small ships and put regular or escort 
destroyers out of commission (as was done in the Falklands). 
  Moreover, Rafale will have two, very effective laser-guided 
weapons, fireable using Thomson-CSF's Atlis target-designation 
optronics pod, for the attack of local, hardened ground targets 
(concrete shelters, bridges...) and even ships. One is the 
AS30L, which proved itself in the Gulf. Aerospatiale's big, 
air-to-surface missile can be fired from a distance of 12 km, 
carrying 240 kg that will impact at the speed of 450 m/s. The 
other is Matra's BGL bomb, which can be dropped from over 7 km 
away while flying 1,000 km/h. BGL bombs--with laser-guided 
"kits"--come in three versions: 250 kg, 450 kg, 1,000 kg. 
  Rafale will also be equipped with the air-to-surface 
standoff 
Apache that Matra is developing with Aerospatiale. The Apache is 
a cruise, "stealth" missile for both day and night attack of 
various targets (airfield runways, command centers, tank 
clusters, and so on) from a distance of 150 km. It weighs 1.2 
metric tons and carries 750 kg of various submunitions 
(antirunway, antitank, mine, etc.), including the Kriss 
antirunway rocket being developed by TBA. 
  Apache flight tests began last 4 November when an inert 
mockup was fired from a CEV Mirage 2000-N. They continued with 
tests of piloted missiles, then trials of missiles propelled by 
the Microturbo turbojet, whose final flight tests will take 
place next July. 
  According to Jean-Paul Genest, technical director of Matra 
Defense, "the first launches of complete missiles are scheduled 
for late 1994 or early 1995." The propelled and guided Apache 
will fly in ground followance mode using altimetric and 
topographic resetting, then will be correlation guided to its 
terminus using Thomson-CSF's Prometheus radar homing head. 
Prometheus will be tested in advance on an airborne flight 
aboard a Mirage 2000. 
  The Landes Test Center (CEL) is simultaneously testing the 
Kriss submunition. A 900-m-long, 40-m-wide concrete runway has 
also been built in Biscarosse, and will serve as a target during 
Apache test overflights beginning in late 1994 and Kriss 
jettisoning tests in 1995. The program's "main event" will be a 
complete Apache flight that will end with the dropping of 10 
submunitions, including one or two Kriss(s) (with real explosive 
charges), on the runway. It is scheduled for 1996. 
  At the same time engineers will be working to adapt the 
missile to the Rafale (two Apaches under the wings) and Mirage 
2000-D (one under the fuselage), and to the Luftwaffe's Tornado 
(two Apaches under the fuselage) in accordance with the 1992 
contract signed with the MAW (Matra-DASA) consortium. The 
Apache's first flight under the Tornado is scheduled for 
mid-1996, and its start-of-service date for 1997-98. But France 
would like to persuade Germany to move that up to 1996, so that 
industrial production of the Apache coincides with its scheduled 
introduction on the Mirage 2000-5. 
  Rafale will have two types of Matra missiles for air-to-air 
missions. The infrared-guided Magic 2 can engage all sectors, 
even frontally, without precise sighting during short-range (up 
to 30 km) aerial combat. More important, the first multitarget 
and dual-mode (infrared and electromagnetic) air-to-air Mica 
missile will be able to perform all aerial defense missions up 
to 80 km. The Mica will be the primary competitor of the Russian 
R-77 and American AMRAAM missiles (see AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION 
MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No 1451) 
<H5>  Magic 2 and Mica </H5>
  Rafale will be the 17th aircraft to carry Magic 2, which has 
been in production for the last several years to equip numerous 
foreign and French airplanes including the Mirage 2000. The 
90-kg missile will be mounted on the wingtips of both French 
Rafale versions (Navy and Air Force). Jean-Paul Genest says the 
first Magic 2 launches with real missiles will take place in 
1995. 
  In contrast, the Dassault airplane will be able to carry up 
to eight 100-kg Micas on its wingtips and under the fuselage and 
wings. The Navy will start with only the electromagnetic version 
(with a Dassault Electronique AD4A radar homing head) mounted 
under the wings or fuselage, and Magic 2s on the wingtips. Work 
to adapt the Mica for mounting on Rafale's wingtips will begin 
in 1995. 
  But Mica reached an important milestone last July when it 
successfully completed its first multitarget launch 
demonstration. A Mica with a radar homing head was fired from a 
Mirage 2000 against a patrol of two subsonic C22L 
target-missiles at CEL. 
  Another multitarget engagement is slated for this year, says 
Genest. Two electromagnetic Micas will engage two Aerospatiale 
target-missiles in a more complex scenario involving electronic 
countermeasures. Genest also announced multitarget launches for 
infrared Micas, scheduled in 1995-96. 
  The infrared Micas will feature Matra-SAT's infrared imaging 
homing head, whose final version (type B) has just been 
delivered after prior airborne flight tests. According to 
Genest, "Matra will be ready to fire the first infrared-guided 
Mica in late 1994." 
  Technically, says the company, there is an 18-month to 
two-year lapse between the two Mica versions (radar and 
infrared), and Mica's development program has been rescheduled 
for completion at the same time as the Rafale. Consequently, 
most Mica flight tests will take place in 1994-95, with a few 
additional adaptation or assessment launches in 1996-97. 
  Mica's industrialization is being prepared at the same time, 
at the Celles Saint-Denis factory (Sologne) where Matra will 
install the Mica production line in mid-1994. Mass production of 
50 electromagnetic missiles a month will begin in late 1995, 
with production of the infrared Mica kicking off 18 to 24 months 
later, around the middle or end of 1997. 
  Genest says that should mean that an EM Mica will go into 
service by the end of 1996 or early 1997, first aboard French or 
export Mirage 2000s, notably Taiwan's. Taiwan was the first 
foreign Mica customer, and has ordered 960 of the missiles for 
its 60 Mirage 2000-5s. Moreover, the Mica is competing against 
the AMRAAM in Sweden to arm the JAS-39/Gripen (see AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No. 1458). And Matra will 
complete research on how to adapt the Mica to "European" F-16s 
(Dutch, Belgian, Norwegian, and Danish) in 1994.

  [Text] Tests on the guidance system equipment for the 
family of flexible anti-aircraft defense missile systems [FSAF] 
are underway, based on data supplied by the EMPAR [European 
Multifunction Aero-Radar] for which Alenia is responsible. The 
acceptance tests on the antenna for the latter have already been 
carried out at the Alenia plant in Rome (Via Tiburtina), to the 
complete satisfaction of the Navy who placed the order. The 
performance obtained during the tests was better than had been 
specified by the French-Italian client. The program has 
therefore been given full confirmation. It provides for the 
necessary qualification tests on the EMPAR guidance system to be 
set up and carried out at the Italian center for radar testing 
and aboard the Italian naval frigate Carabiniere. This is one 
of the most recent stages in the Italian-French program 
developed by the Eurosam consortium, which was established in 
1989 by Alenia (a Finmeccanica company) together with the French 
companies Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale and where 50 percent of 
the personnel is engaged in research. 
  Two other important stages were completed at the end of 
1993. 
The first was the installation of the first Arabel guidance 
system at the French air defense systems experience center 
(SESDA) at San Mandrier near Toulon at the beginning of 
December, after it had passed a series of intensive tests at 
Thomson-CSF. Here the system was put through a long series of 
tests in a marine environment. The first experimental prototype 
of the Arabel electronic-scanning multiple-function radar had 
already been tried out at the Cel testing center at Biscarosse 
near Bordeaux, to confirm some technical choices. 
  Another guidance system for the ground version of the FSAF 
is 
currently being factory-tested and there are plans to install it 
in the site shelter next year. 
  The Aster-30 missile was launched for the first time from 
the 
Biscarosse center using a real vertical ground launcher on 1 
December. The goal of this test was to verify the interaction 
between the missile and the launcher at the moment of lift-off, 
the effects on the launching platform, and the behavior of the 
missile at the start of its trajectory. This first launch of 
the Aster-30, which was hailed by the French defense minister as 
being one of the enterprises contributing to the progress of 
European defense, follows a dozen launches of the Aster-15 that 
had the goal of ratifying the basic functional systems of the 
missile; such as the mixed aerodynamic and jet (PIF-PAF) flight, 
the vertical launch, and the correct trajectory from the initial 
interception stage for hypersonic targets in grazing flight also 
at short range. 
  The first concrete realization of the Eurosam FSAF program 
will be in 1996, with the installation of the self-defense 
surface-air antimissile system (SAAM) aboard the new French 
aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle.

  [Text] Thousands of bright colored dots on the computer 
screen reconstruct the images of animals: A wolf moving with 
suspicion, a group of deer in search of drinking water, a family 
of wild boars, father, mother and three little ones coming out 
from behind a bush. It is the middle of the night in the wood, 
but a strange electronic creature is spying on the secrets of 
nature. At first sight it resembles a camera mounted on a 
tripod, but there is something special inside those lenses and 
printed circuits. In the absence of light an infrared eye 
records details that not even the most sophisticated lens would 
be able to see during the day. Officine Galileo of Florence 
have jokingly renamed the nocturnal vision system an "electronic 
owl." Why is it different from all the others? Because the 
"electronic owl" does not act on reflected light as usually 
happens, but succeeds in capturing the radiation emitted by the 
subject. 
  The glass lens has been replaced by an opaque germanium disk 
that helps in capturing wavelengths that are not visible to 
normal cameras. The images are then processed by a workstation, 
which reproduces the outline of the animals, their most secret 
habits, their movements, and their numbers on the monitor. This 
technology is also used in the military sector. Officine 
Galileo has applied it to firing and sighting systems used 
during the Gulf War. Above all, the system developed by the 
Tuscany-based company, does not annoy "the animals of the 
night." In fact, the animals are not aware of the presence of 
the electronic intruder and therefore their reactions are 
recorded without any outside interference. The "infrared owl" 
is just the first in a series of projects developed as a result 
of the reconversion of Officine Galileo's military sector 
production which accounted for 80 percent of its total 
production up to 1978. A system that combines a mix of 
leading-edge technologies, electronics, and computer science has 
been developed to safeguard against forest fires. Special 
cameras installed in various parts of the forest and connected 
to a computerized center, provide precious round-the-clock 
information on the area and sound the alarm in case of fire. 
  The civil sector technology has another winning card: the 
multiple use of systems. For example, the fire watchdogs can 
also be used to transmit information of the state of health of 
vegetation and on pollution levels. Today, the majority of 
Officine Galileo's production is dedicated to civil systems 
(approximately 60 percent) and primarily for environmental 
protection. A bet that Officine Deputy Director Bruno Minguzzi 
comments on with a little bitterness: "There is still little 
awareness in connection with environmental protection and 
conservation. Programs are either not being launched or proceed 
very slowly."

<F P=106> [Article by Jacopo Giliberto: "The Lower House Says Yes to </F>
the Environmental Agency"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- Environmental policy will have an 
"operational branch," a single body dealing with ecological 
monitoring, technical standards, data collection, and the 
promotion of research into pollution. It is the National 
Environmental Agency (ANPA), the establishment of which the 
lower house approved yesterday morning with 284 votes in favor, 
24 against, and 11 abstentions just before the motion of 
confidence in the government. ANPA will perform controls in 
companies and in all environmentally hazardous situations and 
will also submit proposals and advice to central and local 
government concerning the accepted levels for pollutants, 
standards for the quality of the air and water, and waste 
treatment. 
  The document approved by the lower house is identical to 
that 
approved by the senate last December and transforms a previous 
-- but very different -- government decree into law. Its 
creation was "long-winded and difficult" commented the former 
Green and later PSI [Italian Socialist Party] representative 
Rosa Filippini, who was also one of the most fervid supporters 
of the new organism. But the crucial moment for its creation 
was the 18 April referendum that removed the responsibility for 
health controls from the local health units. The first decree 
is dated 1 August and gives the go-ahead on the bureaucratic 
procedure during which the document was reviewed three times and 
underwent considerable modifications. 
  From the structural point of view, the initial proposals -- 
based on overseas experience -- provided for a "light" central 
organism (no more than 200-300 employees) with a widespread 
presence at local level or vice versa a "heavy" central 
structure with a barely noticeable local structure. A 
compromise was decided upon: Provincial and regional authorities 
will be required to establish their own territorial facilities 
to work side by side with a large-scale national agency. The 
"heart" will be ENEA's [National Agency for New Technologies, 
Energy, and the Environment] DISP (with a staff of about 300), 
which represents the former and now under utilized nuclear 
program control body; an additional 150 people from other ENEA 
departments; staff from other organisms such as the Higher 
Institute of Health; ISPESL (Safety in the Workplace); the CNR 
[National Research Council], and from some ministries (primarily 
the environment ministry). The ANPA management will be composed 
of three directors appointed by the environment minister (with a 
three-year term in office) who will nominate the president. The 
director general will be appointed by the prime minister, but on 
the basis of proposals made by the environment minister. 
[passage omitted] 
  In particular, the recently-approved law creates new 
controls 
that will supplement existing ones (which the law did not 
abrogate). Here are some examples. ANPA will have jurisdiction 
over regulations concerning industrial waste, as will the CNR 
and the Higher Institute of Health; work safety, together with 
the labor ministry; polluting emissions, which also remain the 
jurisdiction of the Higher Institute of Health; the issuance of 
the "green" European label (Ecolabel) and ecoauditing, for which 
there are no specific organisms. It does not amend the 
jurisdiction set for the CNR, the national department of 
technical services (which falls under the prime minister), and 
ENEA (which comes under the industry ministry). [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article: "Ceramics Benefit from CAD/CAM [computer aided </F>
design and manufacture]"] 
  [Text] The "Fabception" principle [a portmanteau neologism 
combining "fabrication" and "design"] is meant for manufacturers 
interested in developing parts made of ceramics or ceramic 
composites. 
  The Center for Technical and Technological Research and 
Innovation (CRITT) is introducing to the market, with the help 
of the Vierzon-based "Z3T" company, a new concept--the 
"Fabception" principle--based on computerization of the entire 
fabrication process for parts made of reputedly unstable 
materials such as ceramics and ceramic composites. According to 
Z3T officials, Fabception can reduce from 40 days down to 5 the 
time elapsing between design and fabrication of parts, including 
all phases of product development, to wit: 


    -  product definition and design, with the help of CAD 
systems such as Euclid and Catia; 
  -  analysis of part feasibility 
via prototyping with the help of automated mechanisms, as well 
as simulations for the analysis of contraction, deformation, and 
density; 
  -  simulation of the production process and on-screen 
analysis of tooling (i.e. mold) practicability; 
  -  preparation of 
the mold or model by means of CNC machining with 
three-dimensional control; 
  -  experimental fabrication to validate 
simulation results; 
  -  serial production and optimization of the 
manufacturing process. 


    Beyond the fact that Fabception covers all stages of the 
process, it integrates all the software (robots and equipment) 
into a single, continuous process. This implies a single, 
integrated communications system; a single, consolidated 
database; technological know-how; and a new methodological 
approach. In addition to saving time and resources, it permits 
simplification of various processes.

<F P=106> [Article by Erick Haehnsen: "Adam or Manufacturing Robot of </F>
Future"; Subhead: "Mobile Autonomous Robot: One of Most 
Autonomous Mobile Robots in World. Used as Technological 
Demonstrator for Studying Mars Planetary Exploration Vehicles. 
Although Project Is Only in Research Stage, Results Realized 
Have Already Been Transferred to More Immediate Industrial 
Projects."] 
  [Text] The most autonomous robots flourish in the most 
hostile environments. In their urge to trod on "terra incognita" 
where humanity dreams of going -- or refuses to step! -- 
engineers and scientists are giving us a glimpse of what the 
next century's industrial robot may be. For the time being the 
non-manufacturing robot has the upper hand. Not only are mobile 
robots starting to perceive an uneven natural environment, they 
are also recreating a mathematical representation of it. In a 
word, they "understand" what they see. The only thing left for 
them to do is to "soar with their own wings." 
  Using a shrewd magical blend of sensors and powerful 
algorithms for perception, navigation and assisting in 
decision-making, mobile robots are gradually severing the 
umbilical cord linking them to their "procreators." Witness the 
preliminary French Automated Planetary Vehicle [VAP] project. 
For the time being the algorithm is installed on Adam, the 
French-Russian robot that has been used as a technological 
demonstrator in civilian emergency response robotics, under the 
Eureka-Advance Mobile Robotics [AMR] program. VAP itself should 
see one of its initial versions take its first steps at Toulouse 
in two or three years on uneven ground modeling the Martian 
terrain, prior to the departure of the final robot for the red 
planet in about a decade at best. 
<H5>  World-Scale Showcase Project </H5>
  Georges Giralt, in charge of the On-Site Planetary 
Intervention Robots [Risp] group and research director at Laas 
in Toulouse, understated it in proclaiming: "It is a showcase 
robotics project for the entire world. Even our robotics expert 
friends on the other side of the Atlantic are jealous of us for 
it." Specifically, Georges Giralt remarks: "The transfer rate 
for communicating with the planet Mars is restricted to a 
maximum of one Kbit/s. That also entails a two-way communication 
lapse of 40 minutes. Under those conditions there is no way to 
remotely operate a robot. Nor, in the event of a failure, is 
there any way to dispatch a mechanic. It is `tops' on a 
graduated scale of difficulties. VAP will therefore have a full 
day's operational autonomy. Overnight the device will send us 
its report, its position and its images. In the morning it will 
get its instructions for the entire day." 
  The program brings together powerful research organizations 
such as Air Test Center [CEA], National Center for Space Studies 
[CNES], National Scientific Research Center [CNRS], National 
Institute for Research on Data Processing and Automation [INRIA] 
and National Office for Aerospace Studies and Research [ONERA], 
not to mention industries like Alcatel Espace, Cybernetix, Matra 
Marconi Space, Sagem. While waiting to enthrall the U.S., 
European and Russian space agencies, this preliminary project is 
already benefiting from the Eureka I-Ares label for the 
perception and decision-making autonomy aspect. 
<H5>  Telemetry and Charge-Coupled Device [CCD] Stereoscopy: Two </H5>
Complementary Vision Systems 
  Following is the objective on the perception level: with a 
10-meter accuracy, VAP is to receive an initial modeling of its 
Martian environment. To do so, a satellite will vaguely indicate 
the natural "landmarks" -- beacons -- it is to pinpoint. Then 
the robot will demand more specific data on the order of a 
meter. After that and before generating trajectory models and 
planning its movement, the exploratory robot on its own is 
supposed to craft a more accurate model of its environment and 
to gradually consolidate it with the measurements it will 
acquire on site as it moves forward. That is where artificial 
vision comes into play. 
  As of now, the Adam demonstrator has relief "vision" through 
the use of a "3-D laser camera" and two CCD cameras. Both 
systems, laser telemetry and stereoscopy, are complementary. The 
Martian atmosphere, after all, is 5,000 times denser than our 
own and yields highly contrasted images over uneven areas. This 
is fine for stereoscopy. Stereoscopy, however, does not 
distinguish between a shadow or a dark trough. Hence, the value 
of the laser camera that uses a set of two pivoting mirrors to 
horizontally and vertically scan over a 25-30 meter depth. At a 
speed of 100,000 calibrated measurements per second, the 
"camera" computes the return interval of a beam bouncing off a 
relief. In this fashion it recreates 16,000-pixel images. On the 
down side, telemetry is a glutton for energy. This makes it 
necessary to use a thermonuclear battery as on the Viking 
probes. As the head of the robotics systems department at CNES 
in Toulouse explains: "All the same, the laser camera does 
lighten the algorithm and reduces computational usage." 
  Another problem is the system's mechanical fragility. If the 
"Mars landing" turns out to be too abrupt, the telemeter will be 
rendered inoperable, at least in the current state of technology. 
  Hence the warp-free stereoscopy that is under research by 
the 
team under Olivier Faugeras, director of research at the 
Sophia-Antipolis INRIA. Launched at 20-30 cm/s, the robot will 
actively model its environment on the basis of two or three CCD 
cameras. At the rate of one image every three seconds, the INRIA 
algorithm analyzes each of the 50,000 pixels per image. It 
compares them, assembles them and fashions a digital model of 
the terrain. To "see" the relief, the computer merges the 
cameras' images. 
  The system dispenses with the standard sight customarily 
used 
to compute polar line-of-sight (making it possible to find the 
pixel from one image that corresponds to the other). In stereo 
vision this is the traditional way. On the other hand, here, the 
system automatically calibrates itself by deducting that 
right-hand empirically on the basis of several typical points. 
The originality lies in recurrently propagating the results 
realized for one pixel to adjacent pixels, both horizontally and 
vertically. The result is that computing time is significantly 
scaled back. For example, for a 100-pixel window, the 
computational gain is a factor of 10. As Bernard Hotz, an 
engineering expert on contract with INRIA, puts it: "It becomes 
much larger for a big window." 
  Vision is supplemented by an odometer (that counts the 
revolutions of the wheels to measure the distance traversed) and 
the inertial control center (that measures spatial inclinations, 
position and accelerations) as in aircraft. 
<H5>  One Difficulty: Merging Algorithms </H5>
  As can be imagined, one of the major difficulties resides in 
merging the data coming from such different sensors. All the 
more so, since they will be used to plan movements and compute 
trajectories. This creates a significant technological bond. 
Once the robot's environmental model has been incremented, the 
movement planning algorithm developed by Jean-Paul Laumond and 
Thierry Simeon, researchers at Laas, categorizes terrains as 
"level," "level inclines," "unknown," "obstacles" and "unknown." 
Even on uneven ground the robot will select a simple "level" 
route relative to the objective to be reached and its technical 
features, so as to avoid risky situations. 
  VAP is already performing some chores, especially (2 D) 
level 
terrain trajectory computation applied to the automation niche 
for automobiles and cooperative management of fleets of 
maintenance robots at ports, airports and railway shunting yards 
(Esprit-Martha). Another transfer is stereoscopy for spotting 
veins of uranium in order to use robots to extract it, a 
wholesome use of robotics, since even in the mineral state that 
metal is radioactive.

<F P=106> [Article by Richard Sietmann, Physics World's German </F>
correspondent: "Are Niche Markets Europe's Last Chance in 
Semiconductors?"] 
  [Text] Last year the Heinrich Hertz Institute in Berlin 
completed the development of an electronic video projection 
system with a fully-fledged laboratory demonstrator. It works 
very much like the celluloid film in an ordinary movie projector 
-- albeit by reflecting rather than transmitting light -- and 
does not have any moving parts. The prototype is based on a 
sophisticated "light-valve chip" that electronically controls 
the pixels of a viscoelastic silicon-gel film and incorporates 
all the features needed for projecting digital high-definition 
TV (HDTV). 
  Independent experts confirm that the full-colour 
demonstrator 
outperforms conventional liquid-crystal light-valves in 
efficiency and brightness. It could replace today's enormously 
bulky large-screen TV projectors with portable desktop systems 
-- if only a company were willing to add some engineering and 
market the device. But the Heinrich Hertz Institute is still 
waiting for such a company and the project has been shelved. 
The story is all too typical of European microelectronics -- 
good research but not enough value-added commercial products. 
  Engineering and research are drifting apart in Europe. 
Engineers in industry struggle with managements and markets, 
process yields and cost-efficient equipment, in-house resources 
and external subcontractors. Researchers busy themselves with 
nano- and molecular electronics, and new semiconducting 
materials such as gallium arsenide, silicon-germanium compounds 
and polymers. Researchers are excited by change, engineers rely 
on some kind of stability over the design phase of a new product 
or application. 
  The current speed of innovation increases the lead of 
companies who can afford to take risks, and undermines the 
competitiveness of those who cannot. Companies without the 
profits generated by previous successful products find it 
increasingly difficult to compete and can get caught in a 
vicious circle. The Japanese semiconductor industry invested 
some $5.2 billion (about &pound;3.5 billion) on R&amp;D in 1992 
and the 
U.S. spent $3.5 billion, according to industry analyses 
Dataquest. European companies only managed $1 billion. The 
figures for capital spending on equipment and plant are equally 
bleak; Europe only invested $0.8 billion of the global figure of 
$10 billion. "The greatest shortfall is in capital," says 
Michael Glennon from Dataquest. "European chip manufacturers 
invest too little, stick to the wrong products and applications, 
and don't export enough. Even the Asian-Pacific rim (which 
excludes Japanese companies) has out-invested Europeans in 
plant, giving these companies the ability to out-produce 
Europeans. European companies start with a production 
disadvantage -- even before products are developed." 
  "Practically speaking, the European semiconductor industry 
has come to an end," says Lubomir Cergel from Motorola's R&amp;D 
group in Geneva. The U.S. chip manufacturer currently has a 
turnover of $1.3 billion in Europe, and expects it to almost 
double over the next two years. But is this prediction of 
Europe's prospects too pessimistic? 
<H5>  Strengths and Weaknesses </H5>
  According to Dataquest the biggest growth areas in the 
European semiconductor market over the next five years will be 
data processing, communications and industrial electronics. 
Unfortunately Europe's chip suppliers are strongest in slow 
growth areas like transport, consumer electronics and military 
applications. "European companies are losing their share of 
their own market," says Glennon. There are no European 
companies in the top 10 of Dataquest's latest ranking of 
semiconductor vendors (table 1). European chip users are also 
falling behind their competitors (table 2).

  So what impact has the Joint European Submicron Silicon 
Initiative (JESSI), conceived in 1988, had on the European 
microelectronics industry? Some key figures like Pasquale 
Pistorio, head of SGS Thomson Microelectronics, a JESSI member, 
thinks it has delivered. Europe's decline, Pistorio said 
recently, has been "stalled and stabilized." However, this year 
NEC, Japan's leading chip manufacturer, will spend 50 percent 
more on R&amp;D alone than JESSI will on the whole "food chain" 
of 
chip production including materials, equipment and applications. 
Europe is also falling behind in the considerably smaller, but 
growing, gallium arsenide market. 
  "JESSI suffered from a shortage of support from Europe's 
major producers and, in particular, a lack of government 
backing," says Max Syrbe, former president of Germany's 
Fraunhofer Society. "As a pure research and technology 
programme deprived of an accompanying industrial policy, JESSI 
had little scope for major success." Klaus Knapp of Siemens 
Semiconductors agrees: "The race for standard products such as 
microprocessors and memories has been lost." 
  However, Europe does have what Syrbe calls a "second chance 
in microelectronics": niche markets with application-specific 
integrated circuits [ASICs]. ASICs combine the circuitry of 
memories and processors necessary for specific, complex tasks on 
a single chip. "Europe," says Syrbe "must establish a firm hold 
on the ASICs market." 
  Establishing a presence in new ASICs markets -- such as HDTV 
or broadband communications -- may be easier, and more 
profitable, than trying to wrestle a larger share of existing 
niche markets -- such as smart power devices and photovoltaics 
(see box 1). ASICs could be profitable in both small and large 
volumes. "The value added in production is much higher (than 
standard chips) due to their greater sophistication and hence 
lower exchangeability," says Knut Heitmann from Daimler-Benz. 
He expects the fabrication plants of the future to be small and 
that manufacturing will shift from large companies to small and 
medium-sized enterprises. "Mini-fabs" will speed up chip design 
and manufacture, and cut the critical "time to market." 
<H5>  Box 1: Semiconductor Sidelines </H5>
<H5>  Smart Power Devices </H5>
  Semiconductor power switches have long been known as 
thyristors. Modern power semiconductors are increasingly used 
for process and control and automation. When these devices, 
which control currents, voltages and frequencies in circuits, 
are monolithically integrated with signal processing 
capabilities, engineers speak of "smart power devices." 
  The world market volume for power semiconductors is 
estimated 
to be about $6 billion, roughly one-tenth of the total 
semiconductor market. Power ICs [integrated circuits] account 
for about $1.2 billion, smart power ICs for about $0.5 billion. 
SGS Thomson Microelectronics is the market leader in both these 
niches with an 18 percent share of the market. 
<H5>  Photovoltaics </H5>
  More than 100,000 homes in the U.S. generate their own 
electricity, with more than two-thirds of these using solar 
(photovoltaic) power. However, solar power is expensive (about 
one dollar per kilowatt-hour) and photovoltaic systems cost 
almost twice as much as other renewable-energy systems based on 
wind or hydro power. 
  Global sales of photovoltaic systems were about $431 million 
in 1992, according to analysts, Strategies Unlimited. This 
represented some 56MW of power and more than half a million 
square meters of solar panels. The leading companies were 
Siemens Solar (14 percent of the market), Solarex of the U.S. 
(11 percent), and BP Solar, Sanyo and Kyocera (7 percent each). 
Forecasts for the year 2000 are between 280MW and 440MW. 
  Whether photovoltaic systems can make it from a fringe 
economy to the mainstream will depend on politicians. Efforts 
to limit global warming could lead to carbon taxes which would 
raise fossil fuel prices and make investments in solar power 
more competitive. "It's all heading in the right direction," 
says Jim Skelly, who oversees solar research at Texas 
Instruments. "But there is a lot of science and engineering to 
be done to make it in the mass market." 
  The mini-fabs would also implement a new manufacturing 
concept in which large clean rooms are replaced by so-called 
"mini-environments," the semiconductor wafers are transported 
and handled in scaled boxes, and all the critical process steps 
(such as lithography, coating and plasma etching) are carried 
out very close to the wafer. Daimler-Benz's Temic subsidiary is 
about to establish a mini-fab at Heilbronn in Germany in a JESSI 
flagship project called Flexible Automated Wafer-handling. The 
Standard Mechanical Interface, developed in 1990 by the Taiwan 
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, will be used to handle and 
transfer the wafers. 
  Temic plans to use very precise laser beams to "write" all 
the active and passive components of the ASICs, as well as their 
metallic interconnections, onto a large wafer. Although this is 
slower than conventional microlithography (in which the whole 
wafer is exposed at once through a mask), it removes the need to 
mount and interconnect several smaller chips on a mother board. 
If the demand arises, this serial processing approach for small 
numbers could be stepped up to a full parallel processing for 
volume production. 
  Heitmann is convinced that this approach represents a 
"quantum leap in technology and will create changes and 
competitive advantages for all the European microelectronics 
industries." But not everyone agrees. At Motorola, Cergel 
believes the ASICs strategy "shies away from the problem" and 
that it will not solve the basic issue of competitiveness. 
Another problem, he says, is that with the possible exception 
of a few companies like LSI Logic, "nobody has earned money with 
ASICs yet." Michael Glennon at Dataquest agrees: "It is a very 
competitive market and the return is very low in most cases." 
  Moreover, Europe is not going to have the ASICs market to 
itself. Texas Instruments is already planning a "single-wafer 
fab" in which each silicon or gallium arsenide wafer can be 
processed with different parameters. "With cost-efficient, 
small-volume manufacturing of logic chips," says Robert Doering 
of Texas, "the American semiconductor industry will keep its 
technological edge."

and the rest of the world (Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore) showed 
the largest growth on 1992.

  ASICs allow companies to improve their products by making 
them with customized circuits rather than standard components. 
Although this costs more, the advantage, says Glennon, "is a 
more competitive piece of equipment." The benefit does not come 
from straightforward substitution but from extra functions and 
features. 
  "The trend is for more features at the same or lower price," 
says Ruediger Buerkel from ABB Ixys Semiconductors. In 
electronics, he says, there are now bigger profits to be made in 
systems than in semiconductor manufacturing. "Some people even 
say you cannot earn money with semiconductors," he adds, "but if 
you lose access to these driving forces, you will soon be out of 
business." Buerkel thinks the ASIC strategy might work if there 
are strong markets. 
  ASICs could be successful in some traditional markets but 
the 
big opportunities will be in new markets. These include: 
  -- Image processors for HDTV sets; 
  -- Ultrafast components for switching, multiplexing and 
compressing broadband communications signals; 
  -- Chips for the encryption of messages and digital 
signatures with chip-cards ("smartcards"). 
  For many years memory chips, notably dynamic random access 
memory (DRAM) chips, were a yardstick for progress in 
microelectronics: 1 Mb [megabyte], 4 Mb, 16 Mb, 64 Mb... Each 
new generation required smaller feature sizes on the 
semiconductor. The current generation of 16 Mb chips have 0.5 
micron features -- 64 Mb chips will need 0.35 micron features. 
But memory chips are now a bulk commodity and there is a 
widespread belief that they have lost their role as technology 
drivers. "The learning curve requires a high-volume product in 
the wafer-fab for an extended time period," says Knapp. "This 
may be DRAMs, or microprocessors, but analogue/digital 
converters for ISDN [integrated services digital network] 
telephones, for example, would also do if you could produce, 
say, five million pieces annually." 
  The cost of innovation has also increased as feature sizes 
have become smaller and more and more companies are 
collaborating on R&amp;D, and not always within the same country 
or 
continent (see box 2). 
<H5>  Box 2: To Collaborate or Not? </H5>
  France Telecom has been involved in a number of joint 
ventures through its research centre, CNET. SGS-Thomson and 
CNET have set up a silicon microelectronics research centre in 
Crolles, near Grenoble, to develop integrated circuit 
technologies and build prototypes for the 0.5 micron technology 
needed for 16 Mb memory chips. CNET had previously transferred 
expertise in 1 micron and 0.7 micron silicon technology to 
Matra-MHS. 
  CNET has also collaborated with Philips in the development 
of 
active-matrix liquid-crystal displays for low-cost flat-screen 
displays. It is also working with Alcatel Optronics on laser 
technologies for optical transmission and distribution. 
  At the inauguration of the Crolles centre in September, 
1992, 
the French industry minister, Gerard Longuet, suggested the 
possibility of other companies joining the centre. Longuet 
explicitly mentioned Siemens. Are they interested? "It depends 
on what is to be done in Crolles," says Klaus Knapp of their 
semiconductor division. "As long as basic research is the 
purpose, we are hesitant, since we already have a good research 
lab in Munich." 
  Siemens has since announced that it plans to establish a 2 
billion German marks [DM] factory for the production of 0.5-0.25 
micron chips in Dresden. Unconfirmed reports suggest that more 
than DM300 million of the funds will come from the German 
government. IBM and Toshiba have been invited to join the 
project. The three companies are already collaborating in the 
development of 256 Mb DRAM chips with 0.25 micron feature sizes. 
<H5>  High-Definition Problems </H5>
  ASIC chips will have major roles to play in high-definition 
television (HDTV), something which the microelectronics industry 
has been looking forward to for almost 10 years. It is still 
waiting as governments, TV and electronics companies try to 
agree on a global HDTV standard. Europe's original plan, known 
as EUREKA 95, was to go from conventional TV to fully digital 
HDTV via two intermediate steps that combined analogue and 
digital transmission techniques -- D2-MAC (multiplexed analogue 
components) and HD-MAC. 
  Originally it was thought that digital HDTV could only be 
delivered by optical fibres, but advances in video compression 
mean that it should be possible to transmit the signals similar 
to conventional TV. Broadcasters and governments now favour 
going direct to digital HDTV and electronics companies, in 
particular Philips and Thomson, have been forced to write off 
enormous investments in D2-MAC and HD-MAC. The total private 
and public investment is estimated to be several hundred million 
marks and some 100,000 D2-MAC receivers have already been sold. 
  Thomas Fischer, managing director of Intermetall, a German 
chip-maker involved in EUREKA 95, is angry about what has 
happened. "Europe's industry policy has completely failed in 
HDTV," says Fischer. "We have invested and now we say we'd 
rather wait a couple of years to get a licence from the U.S. to 
introduce the American technology." But even U.S. technology is 
not going to lead to products before 1996. Another problem, 
according to Fischer, is that "the Americans hold the 
intellectual property rights. We are going to cut our last leg 
in consumer electronics -- television sets." 
  However, late last year more than 80 European electronics 
and 
television companies joined together in the digital video 
broadcasting (DVB) project. Philips and Thomson are also part 
of a "grand alliance" with several U.S. organizations to set a 
digital HDTV standard. 
  The microelectronics industry is also targeting broadband 
communications networks based on the asynchronous transfer mode 
(ATM) as a growth area. With ATM, digital signals are packaged 
into 48 byte unit cells plus a header to direct each cell to its 
destination -- irrespective of whether the "payload" consists of 
speech, data, text or video information. The same format works 
for both narrow and broadband signals, making the service 
independent of the transmission technique. Therefore new 
broadband services will be possible on existing links. However, 
ATM will ultimately need a fibre-optic network to demonstrate 
its full potential, especially for multimedia applications. 
  Worldwide there are about 30 ATM pilot trials and 12 
European 
network operators have agreed to set up a transnational ATM 
network. In Europe, both Alcatel and Siemens have developed 
circuits to switch broadband signals at data rates of 155 Mbs-1 
[megabytes per second in the -1 power]. Alcatel's ATM chip 
contains 880,000 transistors and is being fabricated in-house by 
its Mietec subsidiary in Belgium. Siemens has already won 
contracts to deliver ATM systems to Japan's NTT telephone 
company. 
  "Intelligent" credit cards containing microprocessors -- 
which, for example, would allow the user to control access to 
various computer files and records -- could be another 
high-volume niche market for ASICs. "The chip card can become a 
new pillar of the European semiconductor industry," says Ulrich 
Hamann who markets smartcards for Siemens. The world market for 
credit card chips was estimated to be almost $100 million in 
1992 and is expected to rise to almost $600 million, equivalent 
to 400 million cards, by 1997. With some 30 percent of global 
smartcard sales, Siemens is joint market leader with Motorola; 
SGS Thomson and Philips are third and fourth. The top ranked 
Japanese manufacturer, Hitachi, is fifth with 6 percent of the 
market. 
  Signature cards for electronic mail messages could be 
another 
growth industry. These cards would raise the status of hitherto 
informal messages to the equivalent of paper documents, making 
them eligible for legal proof and litigation. The cards would 
be based on the Rivest-Shamir-Adelman (RSA) encryption algorithm 
which also seals an electronic document against subsequent 
changes. Signature cards are believed to be safer than 
handwritten signatures, which can be copied and manipulated with 
graphics software to forge paper documents. 
  However, a public authority would have to issue and 
administer the cards and the present system of four-digit 
personal identification numbers (as used at "hole-in-the-wall" 
cash machines) would have to be enhanced. One possible 
mechanism is a biometric check: A fingerprint sensor on the 
card would only allow the legitimate owner of the card to use 
it. Such a card would need an array of tiny pressure sensors, 
coupled to a signal processor, to compare the actual 
fingerprints with the stored sample. 
  A digital signature card would be what electronics engineers 
call a "microsystem" -- a device that combines microelectronic 
signal processing with sensors and actuators on a single chip. 
Other potential applications of microsystems technology include 
miniaturized surgical instruments, in-situ dosimeters in 
medicine, and micro-analyzers in bioengineering. 
  Hitherto, the gradual extension of precision engineering 
into 
the silicon microworld -- where manufacturing is governed by 
epitaxial laws rather than conventional cutting and turning 
techniques -- has essentially been a research activity. 
However, the market for micro-machines and microstructures was 
already worth $87 million in 1991, according to Market 
Intelligence Research Corp., and is expected to increase to $3 
billion by 1998. 
<H5>  Threats and Opportunities </H5>
  There are many promising technologies, and huge potential 
markets. But somehow they all hinge on infrastructure barriers 
beyond the scope of single manufacturers: 
  -- HDTV needs Europe-wide (at least) standards for digital 
transmission; 
  -- Likewise the success of ATM networks will depend on the 
setting of European broadband communication protocols. 
Furthermore, broadband multimedia services -- such as remote 
access to databanks and public libraries, video-on-demand and 
home-shopping -- all involve issues such as billing, pricing and 
copyright. A huge investment will also be needed to convert 
existing archives and connect them to the network; 
  -- Fingerprint sensors on credit and signature cards will 
need an appropriate legal framework to balance benefits and 
risks, otherwise the public will not accept them. 
  In an age when information is virtually free and globally 
available, it should be relatively simple to identify a large 
number of niche markets. The real challenge will be to exploit 
them successfully. Cost-efficient manufacturing and effective 
marketing are two important parameters. But unless scientists, 
engineers and managers work together to ensure that projects 
like the Heinrich Hertz Institute's video projector do not end 
up gathering dust on the shelf, no amount of top-quality 
research will suffice. Nothing less than Europe's ability to 
compete in the high-tech markets of the next century is at stake.

<F P=106> [Press release from the UK Department of Trade and Industry: </F>
"Tim Sainsbury Launches New 3 Million Pounds Electronics 
Initiative"] 
  [Text] Electronics will be the world's largest industrial 
sector by the year 2000. And, today, Industry Minister Tim 
Sainsbury launched a new initiative to help make sure that the 
British electronics sector stays ahead of the competition. 
  The UK has the fourth largest electronics industry in the 
world. With a turnover of &pound;30 billion the sector accounts 
for 
15 percent of Britain's visible exports. 
  Microelectronics in Business will promote wider use of 
Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) -- with the 
help of &pound;3 million funding from the DTI [Department of 
Trade 
and Industry]. 
  Launching the initiative at a Federation of the Electronics 
Industry lunch, Mr Sainsbury said: 
  `Electronics is not just a growing industry in itself; it 
makes a critical contribution to all other sectors of industry 
and commerce. Process control, analytical instrumentation, 
medical healthcare and information technology are all the result 
of the application of electronics research and technology. 
  `So the efficiency and competitiveness of the UK electronics 
sector is of crucial importance to the rest of industry. 
  `Microelectronics in Business will promote the use of ASICs, 
which can improve product performance and contribute to major 
reductions in size, weight and manufacturing costs; highly 
important selling points in today's increasingly competitive 
markets. 
  `The programme will improve awareness and inform about 
business opportunities through a series of regional seminars and 
workshops. 
  `And it will provide the essential technical training 
through 
several regional support centres. The first two centres in 
Bournemouth and Bolton are already open for business. 
  `The DTI has also taken other initiatives to help the 
electronics industry. 
  `The department's new Electronics and Electrical Engineering 
division has been talking to companies and trade associations to 
understand better how we can help. 
  `Last year Michael Heseltine announced a new Benchmarking 
Challenge for Trade Associations. Two of the successful 
applicants in the first round are in the electronics sector. The 
Printed Circuit Interconnection Federation is benchmarking best 
practice in manufacturing productivity while The Semiconductor 
Business Association is looking at best practice in the 
relationship between suppliers, designers and customers of ASICs. 
  `We have continued to support the Japan Electronics Business 
Association which helps British electronic component suppliers 
sell more effectively to Japanese firms manufacturing in the UK. 
  `On the export side, European task forces have been 
established with the DTI. Two, covering electronic components 
and public sector security have existed for some time. A new one 
will cover the increasingly important area of contract assembly 
-- and tackle the German market. 
  `All of these initiatives demonstrate the Government's 
recognition of the growing importance of the industry. We are 
committed to an active dialogue and partnership with 
manufacturing industry to help them win in world markets.'
