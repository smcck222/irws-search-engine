<F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Alvarado from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] National Banking Commission [CBN] representatives 
have indicated that the CBN is still unaware of any specific 
measures the U.S. Government intends to take in terms of banking 
secrecy in Latin America. A proposal to implement such measures 
was mentioned during a recent meeting between representatives of 
the U.S. Government and the Andean Group member-states--namely, 
Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia. The U.S. plan is designed to 
get Latin American nations to allow the United States to conduct 
all types of investigations into regional banking matters. 
  Meanwhile, CBN President Olga Arosemena de Guizado has 
indicated that current banking secrecy regulations in Panama do 
not pose any obstacles to such investigations. 
  [Begin Arosemena de Guizado recording] At this time, any 
duly 
authorized representative of a foreign government can come to 
Panama and officially request, through the relevant national 
authorities, an investigation into any crime without having to 
breach so-called banking secrecy rules. [end recording] 
  Unfortunately, according to the CBN president, any bank in 
Latin America can be used to launder money. The CBN is 
currently installing modern computer equipment that will allow 
it to better monitor deposits made in the country's banks. 
  [Begin recording] [Arosemena de Guizado] What we could have 
is a client who would go to one bank and deposit 5,000 [currency 
not specified], and then go to another and deposit another 
5,000, and so on, and so on. 
  [Alvarado] [Words indistinct] 
  [Arosemena de Guizado] In such a case, we would never know 
for sure whether this company is the same one that deposited the 
same amount in another bank. These kinds of situations could 
take place. [end recording] 
  The modern computer equipment currently being installed was 
donated by U.S. AID at a cost of $100,000.

  [Text] Banking confidentiality in Panama "should be 
redefined" to avoid the legitimate right to privacy from being 
used as a means to protect the laundering of money from drug 
trafficking, Olegario Barrelier, president of the Panamanian 
Banking Association, has told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA. 
  "As part of the services banks offer to honest local and 
foreign customers, banking confidentiality should be redefined 
in explaining the rights banks, their employees, former 
employees, the National Banking Commission, and other 
authorities should have," Barrelier has said. He has said the 
National Banking Association will present specific proposals to 
the national government "when appropriate." 
  According to Barrelier, total banking secrecy in Panama, as 
in other countries, "does not exist." The banker has said: "We 
would rather say there is banking confidentiality," and he has 
said the legal provision on this issue "is a part of the 
legitimate right to privacy an individual has regarding his 
home, mail, telephone communications, assets, and businesses." 
  According to Barrelier, the proposals at the international 
level, particularly those coming from the United States, 
advocate a limitation on bank secrecy in nations "attempt to 
avoid" individuals or companies linked to drug trafficking that 
use banking services "to camouflage," through banking 
confidentiality, the illegal nature of their revenues. 
  Although the Panamanian Government has taken significant 
measures to avoid the dishonest use of banking services, the 
Panamanian Banking Association "has a great willingness to 
continue cooperating in the struggle against money laundering," 
Barrelier has said.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Ciro Miranda] </F>
  [Text] A gigantic antinarcotics operation is under way in 
Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Dinar [National Narcotics Directorate] and 
the Paraguayan branch of the DEA are participating. A cocaine 
processing laboratory was destroyed near the Paraguayan border, 
some 40 km from Gabino Mendoza. It is presumed that another 
laboratory is located somewhere on Paraguayan territory. 
Several cars that had been stolen in Paraguay were found in a 
sales lot owned by Bolivian drug traffickers. 
  The Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) broke up one of the 
most powerful international drug trafficking networks. The 
network was based in San Matias, some 180 km southeast of Santa 
Cruz, and included Brazil and Paraguay. The FELCN also 
localized and destroyed a clandestine cocaine laboratory near 
the Paraguayan border. 
  The FELCN operation, which included the assistance of DEA 
agents, began on 24 May. The Special Forces raided various 
cattle stations, shops, and car sales lots, particularly those 
selling Japanese cars which were presumably stolen in Paraguay. 
  A laboratory was found south of the Parapiti River, some 40 
km from the Paraguayan border. At the time of the raid the 
laboratory was processing 84.5 kg of cocaine base and 800 grams 
of "angel dust." 
  The laboratory was owned by brothers Mario Enrique, alias 
"Quique," and Luis Alberto Arteaga Seleme, alias "Pelon." 
  Once refined, the drugs were transported to San Matias, 
where 
they were prepared for shipment to Brazil (Corumba cartel) and 
Paraguay. The drugs were also shipped by air through the Chaco 
region, entering Asuncion from different directions. 
  According to official reports these operations involved 
Paraguayan antinarcotics forces--possibly Dinar. This 
association made possible the capture of the individuals 
responsible for carrying the drugs to Brussels (Belgium) and 
Madrid (Spain) for distribution on the European market, where 
prices are higher than in the United States. 
<H5>  Stolen Utility Vehicles </H5>
  On 25 May the FELCN raided the "Autoshoping" [as published] 
car sales lot located at the corner of San Aurelio and Segundo 
Anillo Avenues in Santa Cruz. 
  The police found several Japanese-made four-wheel-drive 
utility vehicles that had presumably been stolen in Paraguay and 
paid for with cocaine. 
  In the yard, owned by "Quique" and "Pelon" Arteaga Seleme, 
the police seized two Mitsubishi Montero utility vehicles, one 
jeep of the same maker, various Honda vehicles, one new Toyota 
minivan, and other vehicles. The police seized a total of 15 
vehicles in the yard. 
  The confiscations continued at other premises owned by the 
brothers Arteaga Seleme and their partners, the brothers 
Wilfredo, Robin, and Ruan Rosales Agreda. The police also 
raided the premises owned by a well-known high society family, 
the Pedraza Ribera family. 
  The FELCN and the DEA also seized a "Beechcraft Bonanza" 
light plane, equipped with a single engine BE-36, and with 
license number CP-854. In the plane the police arrested Mario 
"Quique" Arteaga Seleme, who was carrying thousands of dollars 
in a sack, and another five individuals whose identities were 
not revealed. The operation continues, and NOTICIAS will today 
receive more information about it.

  [Text] Lima, 31 May (EFE) -- Oswaldo Sandoval, president of 
the Foreign Relations Committee of the Peruvian Congress, said 
today that the U.S. decision to withdraw its airplanes and 
radars supporting drug enforcement in Peru favors drug 
trafficking. 
  Sandoval said that the U.S. decision "is incoherent, and 
lacks logic, as everyone recognizes that drug enforcement is the 
responsibility of producers as well as consumers." 
  Sandoval said that without U.S. logistical support in Peru 
"the mafias could transport the drugs without fear of being 
intercepted by the Peruvian Air Force, which joined the drug 
enforcement effort with recognized success in 1992." 
  Arnaldo Velarde, Peruvian delegate before the Inter-American 
Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse (CICAD), said 
that the interruption of the U.S. aid was decided "unilaterally, 
and without consultation." 
  Velarde also confirmed that Washington has suspended the 
flights of its AWAC and Orion airplanes, and has ordered the 
withdrawal of the radar operating in Yurimaguas that is used to 
control flights at the Peruvian and Colombian border. 
  Velarde said: "This will greatly hurt drug enforcement, 
because the Peruvian Air Force lacks the necessary means to 
detect the airplanes flying on the Colombian border, 99 percent 
of which are used to carry cocaine." 
  The suspension of the aid was recommended by the State 
Department with the argument that shooting down civilian 
airplanes suspected of carrying drugs "is a violation of 
international law." 
  The flights of the AWAC and Orion airplanes, which are 
equipped with high technology radars, allowed the Peruvian Air 
Force to detect and intercept the drug trafficking airplanes, 
which in some cases, when they refused to obey the orders to 
land, were shot down. 
  Velarde said that Peru will continue the drug enforcement 
effort "with its own means," but he indicated that the detection 
of airplanes carrying drugs "will be slower, difficult, and 
expensive" without the U.S. aid.

  [Text] In the last six months Peruvian Army, Air Force, and 
National Police drug enforcement units located more than 100 
clandestine airstrips in Upper Huallaga from where drug 
"corporations" have been sending washed cocaine base to new 
processing sites in the Andean Trapezium [an area in southern 
Peru that includes Puno, Cusco, and Apurimac Departments and 
parts of Ayacucho, Huancavelica, and Junin Departments] and 
elsewhere in Peru. 
  The Army has used dynamite to destroy most of these illegal 
airstrips, especially those with concrete runways. In other 
cases either bulldozers or just picks and shovels were used to 
tear up the landing strips. 
  Undercover agents who have infiltrated drug gangs have been 
reporting, however, that the traffickers reopen at least a 
quarter of the landing strips government forces destroy and are 
constantly building new ones. 
<H5>  Huanuco </H5>
  According to information obtained in Leoncio Prado (Huanuco 
Department) after Operation Aries, the drug "corporations" use 
hundreds of peasants enslaved by the Shining Path [SL] to 
rebuild these landing strips. 
  For example: 36 illegal landing strips have been destroyed 
in Huanuco Department along the Frijol, Azul, Megote, Magdalena 
and Camote Rivers and in the jungle areas of Santa Marta, La 
Union, La Morada, Molope, Yanajanca, Cachicoto, Monzon, Santa 
Rosa, Santa Martha, Primavera, Pavayacu, Bajo Sucre, San Pedro 
de Chonta, Alto Huanuco, Cascarilla, Paraiso, and Alto Alianza. 
  Right now planes are operating again from the illegal 
landing 
strips in Monzon, Cachicoto, Santa Rosa, San Pedro de Chota, 
Pavayacu, and Alto Huanuco, although the presence of Huallaga 
Front military forces tracking fleeing members of the broken-up 
Red Sea Battalion is hampering the flights. 
<H5>  San Martin </H5>
  Intelligence sources reported that 42 clandestine landing 
strips built between 1985 and 1990 in San Martin Department with 
the connivance of the political and military of that time have 
been destroyed. 
  According to the sources, the attack on the drug 
"corporations" began in 1991 because previous raids within the 
framework of the so-called Operation Verde Mar [Green Sea] were 
aimed at the "small fry" of the drug trade. 
  These landing strips were located in Ramal de Aspuzana, Alto 
Uchiza, Alto Manteca, San Francisco, El Cairo, Quebrada de 
Huachipa, Puerto Pizana, Polvora, Huicungo, Pachiza, Pucaypillo, 
Bello Horizonte, Alto Aspuzana, Alto Espino, Cruz Pampa, 
Cachiyacu, Huacamayo, Sion, Campanilla, Dos de Mayo, Barranca, 
and Yanayacu. There also were landing strips along a branch of 
the Puerto Pizana-Polvora Highway and along the banks of the 
Balsayacu and Canuto Rivers. Washed cocaine base arrived at 
these strips on rafts and motorboats. 
<H5>  Ucayali </H5>
  It has been reported that eight landing strips that were 
being used not only to ship drugs but also to supply arms to the 
MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] and the SL have been 
destroyed in Ucayali. 
  These strips were located in Santa Ana, Aguaytia, Boqueron, 
and Chumbillo and along a branch of the Federico Basadre Highway 
near Pampas village. The latter strip has been destroyed 
repeatedly, but the latest reports indicate that it is 
apparently back in service. 
<H5>  Loreto </H5>
  Drug enforcement forces have destroyed 18 landing strips in 
Loreto Department where chemical precursors are brought in from 
Bolivia to turn washed cocaine base into cocaine hydrochloride 
at portable processing facilities. 
  These landing strips that the jungle has now swallowed were 
located on the banks of the Putumayo and Napo Rivers and their 
tributaries, and near San Fernando (Caballococha), Yanahuana (on 
the Colombian border), Bellavista, Jerusalen, Yaguas, Huapaya, 
Mishana, Remanso, Estrecho, Genaro Herrera, Baguzon, San Jose de 
Yanayacu, Icarapana, and Vidal (where the Napo-Flor de Agosto 
Highway begins). The landing strips in Flor de Punga-Requena and 
Tumbipoca-Amazon River valleys also were destroyed. In the 
process of the latter operations drug enforcement forces clashed 
with some drug traffickers, whom they arrested. 
<H5>  New and Reopened Landing Strips </H5>
  According to recent reports, however, the landing strips in 
Yanahuana on the Colombian border, Bellavista, and the Flor de 
Punga-Requena and Tumbipoca-Amazon River valleys are back in 
service. 
  It is also rumored that Colombian drug "corporations" have 
had several new landing strips built on the Ucayali River's 
banks and in the jungle of Madre de Dios Department, where 
cocaine-processing laboratories operate. 
  Experts have indicated that gold prospectors who work along 
the Tambopata River's banks are hired to build the new landing 
strips.

    [Editorial Report] Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish on 18 May, 
pages A6-A7, carries an approximately 1,300- word unattributed 
report on the results of the "Aries" antiterrorist operation 
that began on 5 April in Huanuco, Leoncio Prado Province, which 
had become a narcoterrorist center. 
  The Huallaga Front Command and the Armed Forces Joint 
Command 
stepped up actions to destroy the most radical and bloodthirsty 
Shining Path [SL] groups, namely the Peoples Guerrilla Army 
which basically comprises the "Mar Rojo"--which has 300 members 
divided into three or more companies--and the "Fuerza Local" 
battalions. 
  At the start of the operation there were 250 "terrorists" 
hiding in Huallaga, armed with North Korean AKM machine guns and 
RPG grenade launchers supplied by drug traffickers. Some 
repentant SL members said the "terrorists" had occupied some 
villages and formed "defense committees" using peasants as 
guides and shields. 
  Troops were dropped by helicopter a few kilometers from the 
SL groups so as to take them by surprise. The theater of 
operations includes the rural areas of Jose Crespo y Castillo 
and Rupa Rupa in Leoncio Prado. Pamphlets persuading named 
"terrorists" to surrender were distributed in nearby villages. 
Although this initiative did not persuade any SL leaders to 
surrender it encouraged civilians who for years have been forced 
to cooperate with the "terrorists" to hand themselves in. 
  Operations in the Huallaga Front this year have so far 
encouraged 500 "terrorists" to benefit from the repentance law, 
while another 2,500 are currently in the process of doing so. 
  The controversy stirred up by the Aries operation due to 
alleged human rights violations hindered the operation for six 
days, thus allowing the "terrorists" to regroup and escape the 
security forces cordon. One of the main leaders to flee was 
Jose Picon Hilario, aka El Manco who recently murdered two 
government officials in Pucayacu. 
  The Army has recovered many zones that were under SL 
dominance. For example the town of Bella, which was under SL 
dominance for the past 10 years, was recovered by security 
forces in September 1992. Since January, following the last SL 
attack that resulted in the death of 25 of its 300 inhabitants, 
Bella has not experienced any acts of violence. The same goes 
for Aucayacu, Naranjillo, Madre Mia, Uchiza, and Cueva de las 
Lechuzas, etc. 
  The SL has lost the corridor through Chiquian, the capital 
of 
Bolognesi Province, that was used by the "terrorists" to go from 
Huanuco to Pativilca. 
  Some 80 percent of the "terrorists" have been "eradicated" 
from Huallaga and the days are numbered for the remaining 20 
percent in the Cuchara, Primavera, and Yanajanca regions, and a 
new region that includes the Quillaymarca River bank and Santa 
Marta in Maranon Province.

  [Text] According to a reliable judicial source, General 
Jaime Rios Arayco said, in his testimony before Judge Gloria 
Arteaga Lucas: "I am just a scapegoat. The real protectors of 
`Vaticano' are other people, and some of them were rewarded with 
appointments abroad." 
  Gen. Rios admitted, however, that Demetrio Chavez 
Penaherrera 
["Vaticano"] virtually fed the troops deployed in his area of 
operations by giving them money and other donations. 
  In his testimony Gen. Rios said: "At that time we did not 
know he was a drug trafficker. Everyone knew him as a 
prosperous businessman, some kind of generous patron." 
  Gen. Rios and the other officers accused of covering up drug 
trafficking and allowing corruption are being held on Punta 
Lobos Island, Pucusana, in charge of Air Force personnel. 
  General Frank Tweddle Granda, who was sentenced to 15 years 
in prison for drug trafficking, was also held there from 1980 to 
1981. 
  According to the accusations, Gen. Jaime Rios Arayco and the 
other officers did not take any measures during their stay on 
the Huallaga Front to repress the criminal activities of 
Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, "Vaticano," and his gang. On the 
contrary, they had friendly contact with him and received 
"donations" on several occasions. 
  It is even said that Gen. Rios personally prevented the 
capture of some of "Vaticano's" agents, and reprimanded the 
policemen who carried out antidrug operations against his 
consent and authorization. 
  In this regard, Gen. Rios told Judge Gloria Arteaga that the 
accusations are not true, and that he has become "a scapegoat" 
to hide the real protectors of drug trafficking, some of whom 
"have been rewarded with appointments abroad." 
  Apparently Rios was referring to General Eduardo Bellido 
Mora, brother-in-law of Army Commander General Nicolas de Bari 
Hermoza Rios. According to various reports, including the 
comments of Major Evaristo Castillo Aste, Bellido Mora has been 
mentioned as one of the "protectors" of Demetrio Chavez 
Penaherrera. Bellido is currently the Peruvian military attache 
in Israel. 
  It was learned from judicial sources that the other officers 
who were also accused with Gen. Rios Arayco have basically 
agreed with their chief on the Huallaga Front that Demetrio 
Chavez virtually fed the Army Command, donating money to feed 
the troops deployed in that zone to fight drug trafficking and 
terrorism. But according to their instructions, they were not 
aware Chavez was a drug trafficker. 
  Regarding this case, it was learned yesterday that the judge 
of the 42d Criminal Court will ask the president of the Lima 
Superior Court to add the accusations under investigation in the 
47th Criminal Court to the one he--Judge Alzamora--has been 
investigating for months against the main suspect, Demetrio 
Chavez Penaherrera, "Vaticano." 
  A judicial spokesman said that the joining of the cases 
would 
be appropriate as they deal with the same charges against 
"Vaticano," for the sake of economy in the legal process, and 
because events of the same nature, and against the same people, 
cannot be separated. 
  In was reported by judicial sources that Judge Gloria 
Arteaga 
has scheduled for next week new testimony by Gen. Rios Arayco 
and the other officers.

  [Text] Lima, 31 May (EFE) -- Lima newspapers reported on 31 
May that a Peruvian judge has rejected the conditional release 
of one general and 11 military officers arrested on charges of 
drug trafficking. 
  Judge Gloria Arteaga dismissed the petition to release the 
military officers as inadmissible, because "important steps to 
confirm or dismiss the charges" filed by military justice 
against them are still pending. 
  The Army placed General Jaime Rios, former Huallaga Front 
commander, and the other 11 military officers indicted with him 
at the disposal of civilian courts after it was discovered that 
they had covered up drug trafficking activities in the region. 
  The officers involved, besides Gen. Rios, are: Lieutenant 
Colonels Luis Aparicio and Marco Zarate; Majors Marco Landor, 
Alejandro Mutante, and Eliseo Gonzalez; Captains Oswaldo Zapata, 
Carlos Hernandez, and Carlos Marin; Lieutenant Rolando Chiotty; 
and noncommissioned officers Roberto Zarate and Luis Gomez. 
  In 1991 all of them were stationed in the Huallaga Valley, 
the largest cocaine paste production center in the world. 
  The officers are accused of having charged a fee to permit 
drug traffickers to ship their cocaine paste to Colombia. 
  The lawsuit says that the military charged a fee of $8,000 
for single engine planes and $15,000 for twin engine planes, to 
permit them to land and take off in the zone to collect drugs. 
  The money was collected by Uchiza's former Mayor Demetrio 
Diaz and Uchiza's former Governor Carlos Rodriguez. The two are 
currently fugitives. 
  Drug traffickers provided medicines and food to the troops 
through a "civic committee" that coordinated "donations" made 
through Maj. Landor and Lt. Col. Zarate. These two are 
currently in jail under charges of trying to depose Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori in 1992.

  [Text] The Shining Path (SL) terrorist group--once 
described as the most lethal and bloody terrorist group in the 
world--is in the final throes of its alliance with drug 
traffickers. The harsh and devastating blows it has received at 
the hands of the forces of order over the last couple of months 
have considerably undermined its criminal activities in the 
Peruvian jungle. 
  In the Huallaga Front, where most clashes are taking place, 
the Armed Forces and the Peruvian National Police [PNP] have 
separated terrorism from narcotrafficking by attacking it to 
such an extent that any possibility of a future alliance is 
almost nonexistent. The Aries offensive is no coincidence. The 
military command has information on subversive movements in the 
Cuchara region. 
  This military offensive compelled the SL people's guerrilla 
army--the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Army] is almost 
totally annihilated--to desperately take refuge south of the 
Upper Huallaga region while drug traffickers headed north of 
Ayacucho and more recently to Madre de Dios where the Army and 
the PNP are dealing with them harshly. 
  In the Cuchara and Primavera regions--where the Aries 
operation is being conducted--SL commanders are being severely 
questioned by their subordinates who, in view of the 
intensification of military actions, are taking advantage of the 
Repentance Law. 
  These desertions are prompting SL commanders to 
indiscriminately kill any SL member who disobeys orders. 
  Carlos, a 13-year-old boy who escaped with his father from 
the theater of opeations, said: "SL members are killing each 
other because they do not know what to do in the jungle any 
more." 
  This can only be interpreted as a desperate move by the SL 
commanders, who interpret these "rebellions" as the end of their 
Maoist ideology. The Ashasninkas indigenous group are taking 
advantage of this situation and escaping the long and ruthless 
captivity they have endured at the hands of SL. 
  Eight SL terrorists, among them little Carlos, who endured 
the most deplorable living conditions imposed by the SL 
commanders, surrendered five weeks ago at the Quiteni 
antisubversive base in Satipo, in the Frente Mantaro 
jurisdiction. The living conditions in the Army bases in the 
jungle are very different. 
  The Army has installed 15 countersubversive bases with 
military personnel to welcome repentant SL members and to offer 
them the best conditions and treatment. 
  A Tingo Maria military officer says: "We are not saying 
this. 
This is being said by the SL members who surrendered at our 
bases. They do not want to leave. In our installations they 
find food and work and they receive the best treatment."

<F P=106> [Article by Wesley Gibbings: "Dollar Laundering Law Coming, </F>
Says Huggins"] 
  [Text] Government is considering the introduction of 
banking regulations which will make deposit declarations for 
large sums of money mandatory. 
  National Security Minister Russel Huggins made the 
revelation 
yesterday, saying the measure would be one instrument in the 
campaign against money laundering. 
  The matter arose while Huggins steered a motion on the 
granting of diplomatic immunity to the Caribbean Financial 
Action Task Force through the Senate. 
  Huggins was responding to a query from Opposition Senator 
Wade Mark who said commercial banks should not be left on their 
own to monitor a situation that provided vital clues to the 
scale of money laundering activities in the country. 
  "Don't leave it up to commercial banks," Mark said. "One 
important area of money laundering is the commercial banking 
sector." 
  Mark described the current arrangement as a "gentleman's 
agreement." Bankers have however reported some success with the 
system and a number of depositors, according to banking sources, 
have reportedly been turned away as a result. Huggins said 
regulations would be taken to Parliament on the matter "soon." 
  He also defended the country's invitation to the Task Force 
to set up office here, saying it offered a range of resources to 
enable this country to battle money laundering more effectively. 
  He told Senators that the body was not a policing agency and 
that it was established to offer technical advice and expertise 
to counter the incidence of money laundering in Latin America 
and the Caribbean. 
  Independent Senator Martin Daly expressed scepticism about 
the institution and said a trial period of two years should be 
built into the motion granting it diplomatic immunities and 
privileges. He however refused to pursue the amendment when the 
vote was taken. 
  Huggins also addressed fears by Mark that the industrial 
relations climate of certain regional institutions left much to 
be desired. 
  The Opposition Senator contended that the managers of some 
institutions often hid under the cover of diplomatic immunity in 
order to commit serious breaches of the constitutional rights of 
workers. 
  Huggins however said the terms of such diplomatic 
arrangements were dictated by international conventions and 
practices. The motion was passed unanimously. Last Friday, it 
gained similar consent from the Lower House.

Destabilizing   `Centaur Plan'

  [Text] After leaving a private meeting with members of the 
Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee, Defense Minister General 
Rafael Angel Montero Revette acknowledged that part of the 
economic and financial sector is promoting a destabilization 
plan that would affect all other sectors of Venezuelan society. 
  In his elusive responses to newsmen's questions, the 
minister 
said "a plan is being executed, as we all know, which includes 
economic, social, financial destabilization, and subversion. We 
are adopting intelligence measures, however, to investigate and 
to do everything that we can to emerge from the crisis." 
  The minister voiced his optimism about "the measures adopted 
by the government which caused the rumor strategy that they 
tried to implement to fail." 
<H5>  Centaur Plan </H5>
  For his part, Deputy Ibrahim Sanchez, president of the 
Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee, reiterated that they have 
not been able to pinpoint what area of the financial sector the 
Centaur Plan is part of. The Centaur Plan consists of sending 
threatening facsimile statements to certain persons and 
financial institutions to create uncertainty. 
  According to the legislator, the minister referred to 
threats 
of bankruptcy and false dollar quotations as part of a direct 
attack on the Venezuelan financial system. This plan, in view 
of its serious economic implications, will be investigated by 
intelligence officials. 
  Montero Revette cited as an example a package of counterfeit 
dollars detected before they were placed on the financial 
market. This averted a complex situation which could have had 
violent reactions on the part of buyers who would have been 
swindled. 
  The defense minister recognized also that authorities are 
investigating the influence that narcotrafficking might have on 
this situation "where it is not a case of persons of leftist or 
rightist persuasion, but of persons who are motivated by money." 
  Montero Revette ruled out the possibility that officials who 
were dismissed for their participation in the 1992 thwarted coup 
are involved in the destabilization plan. 
  Other deputies who attended the meeting said the defense 
minister had a document on the Centaur Plan, which did not have 
specific information, but which only mentioned a so-called 
"Ayacucho Group."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on drug-related crimes, investigations, trials, 
sentencings, and other activities in the PRC monitored by Hong 
Kong Bureau during the period 17-31 May. The source and mode of 
processing are given in parentheses at the end of each item.

<H5>  Public Security Ministry Commends Zhaoqing, Guangdong Police </H5>
  China's Public Security Ministry has recently issued an 
order 
conferring a Merit Citation, First Class, on the Zhaoqing City 
Public Security Bureau's special group for investigating the "3 
October drug trafficking case" and on a special team organized 
by the Guangzhou City Public Security Bureau's Fenghuang Street 
Police Station for cracking the "20 February drug trafficking 
case." 
  In early October, 1993, after being tipped off on a 
forthcoming big drug deal between domestic and overseas 
criminals, the Zhaoqing City Public Security Bureau successfully 
captured 19 overseas and domestic criminals on 3 October. After 
more than one month of hard work, the Zhaoqing police arrested 
another seven drug traffickers, thereby thoroughly smashing a 
notorious drug-trafficking gang composed of overseas and 
domestic criminals. 
  On the evening of 19 February, 1993, tipped off on 
whereabouts of Li Guoding, an armed robber wanted by police, the 
Fenghuang Street Police Station under the Haizhu District Public 
Security Sub-bureau of the Guangzhou City Public Security Bureau 
set up a special team for tracking down the criminal. As a 
result, Li was captured in the small hours of 20 February. 
After being interrogated, Li confessed to having bought and 
sold drugs in collaboration with criminals from Hong Kong and 
the hinterland. Soon afterwards, the police successfully 
captured six other drug-traffickers, thus smashing another 
notorious drug-trafficking gang. (Summary) (Guangzhou Guangdong

<H5>  Drug Addicts From Hong Kong, Taiwan Receive Treatment in </H5>
Kunming 
  Since July 1991, the PLA-run Drug-Dependent Rehabilitation 
and Prevention Research Institute of the Kunming General 
Hospital has helped the rehabilitation of some 1,300 drug 
addicts including 48 from Hong Kong and Taiwan. At the 
institute, drug addicts usually can quit their habits in less 
than 10 days. Professor Sha Lijun of the research institute 
said they used Western and Chinese medical methods to help 
reduce pain in the process of quitting drug addiction. She said 
that the institute is currently researching with the Beijing 
Military School of Medicine and Science a new medication which 
is expected to be more effective in helping drug addicts quit 
their drug-taking habit. (Summary) (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE

<H5>  Shanghai </H5>
<H5>  Shanghai Procuratorate Prosecutes 26 Drug Criminals </H5>
  Shanghai Municipal Procuratorate has recently instituted 
proceedings against 26 drug-related criminals, among them most 
were unemployed or had previously served in reform-through-labor 
camps. A total of 558 grams of heroin has been seized. A person 
in charge of the procuratorate has given assurances that 
forceful measures will be taken to crack down on drug-related 
crimes. (Summary) (Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in Chinese 
1252 GMT 22 May 94) 
<H5>  Yunnan </H5>
<H5>  Courts Severely Punish Drug Criminals </H5>
  In 1993, courts in the whole province conducted first 
hearings of 2,391 drug-related cases and completed 2,316 of the 
cases, sentencing 3,940 persons. 
  Last year, Yunnan's law courts three times organized 
province-wide large-scale unified campaigns against drug-related 
crimes, convened verdict-reading meetings in 71 counties and 
cities, and executed a number of extremely vicious drug-related 
criminals. When the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture 
Intermediate Court held a drug-banning, verdict-reading meeting 
in Wanding City, it also invited local officials from Burma's 
Muse, Jiugu, and Namhkam areas to attend; at the meeting, 17 
drug-related criminals were executed, and 300,000 grams of drugs 
were destroyed, witnessed by 5,000 people of various 
nationalities from inside and outside the border. 
  The town of Pingyuan held a verdict-reading meeting, which 
was attended by some 10,000 people; at the meeting, verdicts 
were read to 20 drug-related criminals, seven of whom were 
executed. At the same time, law courts in Wenshan Prefecture 
confiscated houses built by 54 drug-related criminals with 
illegal income from drug trafficking. 
  Among the verdicts which became effective in 1993, 3,122 
were 
handed down to drug-related criminals, including 1,039 death 
sentences, death sentences with a suspension period, and life 
imprisonment, thus dealing a severe blow to the arrogance of 
drug-related criminals. (Summary) (Beijing FAZHI RIBAO in

  [Text] Opium Warlord Khun Sa is financing the Karen 
National Union [KNU], led by Gen Bo Mya, in an attempt to 
strengthen the fighting alliance against the Burmese government, 
a reliable source said. 
  Financial support from Khun Sa is believed to total up to 
three million baht, which was handed over to the KNU at a 
meeting in Maneplaw between April 15-17, the source added. 
  Maj-Gen Tun of Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army [MTA] led the 
representative from Shan State in a meeting with Karen guerrilla 
leaders, the source claimed an intelligence report as saying. 
  Both sides received their respective benefits from the move, 
the source remarked. 
  Khun Sa gave financial support to the KNU to secure shipment 
of heroin from the Golden Triangle, the source said adding that 
the first shipment would be from Shan State down the Salween 
River to Moulmein. 
  Khun Sa wanted the shipment secured as it passes areas 
influenced by the KNU, according to the source. 
  The KNU, on the other hand, is believed to be seeking 
financial support from the opium warlord to stage its 
anti-Burmese government operations. 
  The move is the latest development between Gen Bo Mya and 
Khun Sa whose first contact was believed to have been in 1991. 
  Their meeting was designed to strengthen the two 
anti-government groups in fighting Burmese government forces. 
  Prior to the recent secret meeting, both sides met at least 
twice in March and early April to discuss cooperative efforts 
against the Burmese regime. 
  The source said the first shipment of drugs is expected to 
take place after fighting between the MTA and government forces 
subsides, which is expected soon due to the approaching rainy 
season, the source said. 
  The ongoing fighting is seen as an attempt by Khun Sa to 
demonstrate a show of strength and to boost confidence within 
his heroin buying network, the source pointed out. 
  Officials of Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army, contacted by BANGKOK 
POST yesterday, declined comment on the matter.

  [Text] MANERPLAW -- Karen guerrilla leaders have denied 
that their group has formed a political or military alliance 
with opium warlord Khun Sa and his Mong Tai Army (MTA). 
  They said any connection with Khun Sa would only tarnish the 
Karen's anti-narcotics image and reputation. 
  But they did accept that a Karen team had recently made a 
trip to the MTA-controlled area in southern Shan State and met 
Khun Sa. 
  Leaders of the Karen National Union [KNU] said in separate 
interviews that the two-member Karen delegation went to attend 
the celebration of Khun Sa's declaration of an independent Shan 
State and his appointment as Shan State President. 
  The delegation also studied how the MTA had acquired 
logistics and military supplies. 
  The Karen statements came amid strong rumours and reports 
that the Karen and the MTA have struck a deal to cooperate in 
their fight against the ruling Burmese military regime in 
Rangoon. 
  The Burmese defence attache to Bangkok, Col Thein Swe, told 
The NATION early this month that the Karen team went to Shan 
State between April 10-12 to teach Khun Sa's private army how to 
produce anti-personnel mines, and to help set up a munitions 
factory. 
  Thein Swe's charges have been rejected as "groundless 
accusations" aimed at discrediting the Karen and anti-Rangoon 
ethnic movement. 
  In separate interviews with The NATION, KNU President Gen Bo 
Mya, KNU secretary-general Badow Ba Thin, and KNU secretary for 
the organisation department, Maj Gen Maung Maung, flatly 
rejected the Burmese junta's allegations and denied any 
cooperation with Khun Sa and his Mong Tai Army. 
  They said the allegations were intentionally spread to 
discredit the Karen image and reputation, as the KNU had long 
been widely accepted as being against the drug trade. Bo Mya 
said much of the information about the Karen and Khun Sa was 
"exaggerated and untrue." 
  "There is no military cooperation, or any type of political 
cooperation, between the KNU and Khun Sa and his MTA. And there 
will be no cooperation in the future, because I feel that there 
is some kind of understanding between Khun Sa and Slorc [State 
Law and Order restoration Council]," said Bo Mya. 
  The Burmese junta Slorc, or the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council, staged a coup in September, 1988 to 
suppress a nationwide pro-democracy protest. 
  Bo Mya said the Karen delegation went to Khun Sa's area to 
attend the inauguration ceremony after Khun Sa declared the 
independence of the Shan State. The purpose of the trip was "to 
study his type of (political) system, how many people attended 
it (the ceremony) and the real feeling of the Shan population." 
  According to Maj Gen Maung Maung, Khun Sa had sent men to 
the 
KNU to ask about developments in peace talks between the Karen 
and Slorc, and invited the Karen to send representatives to the 
Shan celebration. 
  The two men sent to Shan State were KNU Operation Commander, 
Lt Col Law Wadi, and Lt Col Isaac, the KNU assistant quarter 
master responsible for rations and military equipment. 
  KNU secretary-general Badow Ba Thin said the Karen team 
studied how Khun Sa could purchase new supplies of arms and 
ammunition. 
  He rejected the allegation that the Karen trained the Mong 
Tai Army in how to produce landmines, saying that the MTA 
already had the capacity to do so with the help of some 
Europeans. 
  "We got information that the MTA was able to purchase arms 
and ammunitions and can get new supplies. We wanted to know how 
he could obtain them," said Ba Thin. 
  "We also understand that Khun Sa is in a position to 
manufacture landmines because some Europeans visit his area very 
frequently." 
  While the KNU staunchly denies any official deals with Khun 
Sa, well-informed border sources confirmed that the Karen and 
other anti-Rangoon ethnic movements have constant low-level and 
unofficial contacts with the MTA and the 11 ethnic groups that 
have already reached an official ceasefire agreement with Slorc. 
  One source said such contacts are normal and "crucial to the 
survival and operations of the armed ethnic groups, who often 
share overlapping territory and objectives." 
  "Most important of all they share the same enemy," said the 
source. 
  One KNU official, who requested anonymity, told The NATION 
that the Karen would consider or take whatever measures or steps 
they have to if they are forced into a corner. 
  He was apparently pointing to the pressure put on the group 
by some Thai authorities and brokers, who have threatened to cut 
supply lines or push back ethnic refugees unless the Karen enter 
peace negotiations with Slorc. 
  "We cannot rule out anything and have to consider every 
possible means ... The enemy of my enemy is my friend," the 
official said. 
  Slorc has urged the Karen, the Mon and the Karenni--the 
three 
remaining active armed groups fighting the Rangoon regime--to 
hold ceasefire talks, but has ruled out similar negotiations 
with Khun Sa, saying that Rangoon considers him a drug 
trafficker and will deal with him by force.

  [Text] Forces of the rebel Shan warlord Khun Sa have 
pushed to within 6 km of the strategic eastern Burmese town of 
Tachilek, where 700 government troops face food and water 
shortages, a rebel source said yesterday. 
  "We hope to capture Tachilek," an official of Khun Sa's Mong 
Tai army said. "Our men are very near to the town and the 
defenders are nearly out of food." 
  Last week the rebels, mostly members of Burma's minority 
Shan 
population, reportedly stormed three Rangoon government bases 
near Tachilek and blew up a dam at the town's main reservoir. 
  Heavy fighting at the three government outposts on hills 
surrounding Tachilek between May 17 and 27 resulted in the 
deaths of 160 Burmese troops and 80 wounded, according to the 
Mong Tai army official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
  He said 17 Mong Tai army troop were killed in the fighting 
and another 39 were wounded. 
  Tachilek is the main border trade link to the northernmost 
Thai town of Mae Sai, 1,165 km north of Bangkok. 
  Burmese forces had been reinforced in the area in recent 
months in anticipation of a major offensive, but the Shan rebels 
launched a series of attacks two weeks ago that appeared to put 
Rangoon government troops on the defensive. 
  The Mong Tai army official said two Burmese military jets 
based at an air base at Tachilek flew two sorties May 17-18 
during fierce fighting around the village of Mong Kyawt, about 
24 km from the Thai border. 
  He said the Burmese jets dropped bombs from a high altitude 
because "they are afraid of our missiles." 
  Khun Sa's army, financed through taxes on opium caravans and 
heroin refineries in the Shan State, is equipped with 
surface-to-air missiles. 
  The half-Shan, half-Chinese warlord has been indicted on 
drug 
trafficking charges by a US federal court. 
  A Thai Third Army officer at the border identified the 
Burmese jets as F-7 fighter-bombers, which had been purchased by 
the Rangoon government from China. 
  The fighting in Burma has forced hundreds of Shan, Akha and 
Lahu tribesmen to seek shelter in Thailand because they fear 
being rounded up and forced to carry munitions for the Burmese. 
  Burma's military government, which has been trying to 
establish its control in the Shan State and other rebel-held 
areas for more than 40 years, routinely uses press-ganged 
civilian "porters" to carry supplies.

  [Text] According to the report received on 1 June, the 
fighting between Burmese Government troops and minority rebels 
has eased up in different parts of Burma. All encounters took 
place 50 to 70 kilometers from the Thai border, except for the 
fighting opposite Mae Sai District of Chiang Rai Province. 
  Government troops and the rebels in the vicinities of Namon 
and Hin Kong Mountains and Mong Chot Town continuously exchanged 
artillery shelling. It is believed that the new units sent to 
reinforce the government's position at Thachilek border town are 
planning to attack the rebels now surrounding Mong Chot, Mong 
Ton, and Mong Pan Townships. 
  Kun Sa's men reportedly have set up a field hospital 
opposite 
Lak Taeng Village of Tambon Wiang Luang, Wiang Heng District, 
Chiang Mai Province. The hospital is capable of providing 
treatment for 300 patients. Meanwhile, Khun Sa has dispatched 
3,000 men from Mong Mai, opposite Mae Hong Son Province, to the 
northeastern region of the Shan State. 
  Major General Yutthana Muangmangkhang, commander of the 33d 
Military Circle in Chiang Mai Province, ordered reinforcements 
for the security force at Doi Tung Royal Villa, the residence of 
the princess mother, because the fighting between Burmese 
Government troops and rebels are not very far from the place.

  [Text] Narcotic drugs pose a serious threat to mankind at 
present. The use of and the trafficking in drugs have become 
widespread, thus causing extremely adverse effects on many 
countries around the world. Therefore, the issue of narcotic 
drugs has now become a problem which must be tackled by all 
countries. 
  The above-mentioned statement was made by Souban 
Salitthilat, 
deputy foreign affairs minister and chairman of the Lao National 
Committee for the Control and Suppression of Narcotic Drugs, at 
the opening of a meeting to launch an overall plan for 
controlling and suppressing narcotic drugs until the year 2000. 
The meeting was held in Vientiane early this week and attended 
by drug control and suppression representatives from ten 
northern provinces. In his statement, Souban Salitthilat also 
said: To achieve better results in suppressing narcotic drugs, 
cooperation and coordination must be earnestly established 
between the drug producing and using countries. If the user 
countries only blame the producer countries, mutual suspicion 
will be further deepened and cooperation will become designed 
for unilateral interests only. The minister stressed that Laos 
is ready to cooperate with all countries and international 
organizations in solving this problem with its own ability and 
on the basis of mutual respect for each other's independence, 
sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and mutual benefit. 
  The chairman of the Lao National Committee for the Control 
and Suppression of Narcotic Drugs stressed that on the basis of 
the aforementioned principle, the Lao Government, with 
cooperation from the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, has mapped 
out an overall plan on suppressing narcotic drugs until the year 
2000. This plan spells out urgent requirements, strategy, and 
policy for practical implementation. The plan consists of 16 
projects, requiring a budget of U.S. $35 million to implement. 
The long-term objectives of the plan are aimed at gradually 
reducing the planting of poppy crops, doing away with the 
planting of marijuana for commercial purposes, decreasing and 
controlling the needs [of consumption] of narcotic drug users, 
suppressing drug trafficking and production as well as any 
illegal acts committed in violation of narcotics suppression 
laws, controlling any legal activity on the use of drugs, and 
providing convenience and cooperation to the international 
organizations. 
  The Lao Government has paid close attention to enforcing our 
narcotics suppression laws to suppress trafficking by 
establishing a narcotics control and suppression organization 
staffed with more than 20 police officers to carry out drug 
suppression drives in cooperation with local police, Customs, 
and postal authorities. 
  The Lao National Committee for the Control and Suppression 
of 
Narcotic Drugs was formed in 1990 under the chairmanship of 
Souban and is composed of members from various state agencies, 
namely the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, the 
Customs Department, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 
the Public Health Ministry, the Justice Ministry, the Education 
Ministry, and the Prime Minister's Office.

  [Text] Taipei, June 4 (CNA) -- The two-day national 
anti-drug conference closed Saturday [4 June], with Vice Premier 
Hsu Li-teh telling the more than 200 government officials, 
civilian representatives, scholars and experts at the gathering 
that an information network on drugs must be established as soon 
as possible. 
  Hsu also urged concerned government agencies to fully crack 
down on and severely punish drug users and traffickers. 
  He said the government will take measures to deal with the 
drug problem, including strengthening the anti-drug campaign and 
educating and assisting drug addicts in returning to normal 
lives. An integral part of the campaign will be to include 
information on drugs in primary school and junior high school 
textbooks, he said. Hsu said he hopes the general public will 
join hands with the government to jointly create a healthy 
society free from drugs. 
  The conference opened Friday, an anti-drug day in Taiwan. 
Some 74 kilograms of seized heroin, worth NT [new Taiwan] $6 
million (US$ [figure indistinct]) was burned to coincide with 
the conference.

  [Text] The government incinerated 144 kg of seized heroin 
in the antidrug campaign to mark antidrug day on Friday [3 
June]. The government also called on Mainland China to help 
crack down on the island's worsening drug problem. Within 10 
minutes, the heroin, estimated to be worth 6 billion new Taiwan 
dollars on the street, was consumed in the fire in the national 
incinerator outside of Taipei. 
  The drugs were roughly 10 percent of the [amount] stored at 
the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau's headquarters in 
Hsintien, Taipei County. Justice Minister Ma Ying-chiu said he 
believes if the mainland cooperates, it will be a great help. 
It is apparent that all [word indistinct] drug come [from] the 
mainland. He added: Even drugs from the Golden Triangle where 
the borders of Thailand, Laos, and Burma meet, are smuggled by 
fishing boats from Mainland China. Drug smuggling addiction has 
surged since Taiwan lifted the martial law in 1987.

  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma 
Ying-jeou said Wednesday [1 June] that there are 200,000 drug 
abusers and traffickers in Taiwan, and that the drug problem on 
the island has reached an alarming state. 
  Ma, speaking to the press two days before a national 
anti-drug conference is set to start, said, that although the 
supply and use of amphetamines had dropped 20 percent in the 
first four months this year, the first such decrease since 1990, 
the supply and use of heroin has increased 66 percent. 
  Despite the jump in heroin use, though, he claimed that 
illicit drugs are reportedly in short supply--a sign that the 
war on drugs declared by Premier Lien Chan last year has begun 
to show results. 
  Ma reported that the supply of drugs was at its highest 
level 
last year, when law enforcement authorities seized 1,110 
kilograms of heroin and 3,375 kilograms of amphetamines. 
  He said 47,000 inmates in Taiwan prisons last year, or 31 
percent of the prison population, were in for drug-related 
crimes. The figure was several times that of the past few 
years, he said, adding that drug-related crimes have taken 
precedence over theft and robbery. 
  Speaking on the strategy to combat the drug problem, Ma said 
the Justice Ministry would draft a law to prevent drug kingpins 
from laundering drug money, and will target specific age groups 
in its anti-drug drive. 
  Statistics show that 30 percent of drug-related crimes in 
the 
first four months this year were committed by people aged 
between 12 and 24 years old.

<F P=106> [Interview with Police General Chawalit Yotmani, secretary </F>
general of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB); 
date and place not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Question] At the recent 
seminar in the United States on the global narcotics situation, 
what did the Asian countries say about the situation in the 
countries in the Golden Triangle? 
  [Chawalit] Thailand and the United Nations, whose UNDCP 
office is located in Thailand, talked about the problem in Laos 
and Burma. A master plan for tackling the problem in Laos is 
already completed. A plan for Burma is next, because most of 
the illicit opium cultivation is in that country. It will be 
difficult due to the political issue involving the ethnic 
monorities, which have been waging resistance against the 
Burmese Government. Some areas will not be accessible to 
control by the government. We will have to cooperate with the 
United Nations on this issue. 
  [Question] How much heroin is produced annually in the 
Golden Triangle? 
  [Chawalit] It is estimated at 40-60 tons; no more than 60 
tons at most. These figures are derived from estimated 
cultivation and refining capacities. No one knows the real 
production figures. 
  [Question] How much marijuana is produced in Thailand? 
  [Chawalit] It is estimated at 100-200 tons a year. There 
was a lot of cultivation in the northeast. After the 
eradication efforts were launched, however, cultivation has been 
moved to the mountains and jungles in about 20 provinces in 
various parts of the country. The growers themselves do not own 
the land where marijuana is cultivated. In this way, the 
growers hope they can better avoid detection by the police. 
  [Question] The narcotics traffickers have been able to 
transport their products rather effectively. What has your 
office done to deal with this? 
  [Chawalit] It is not possible for us to inspect every 
container. Therefore, we will have to rely on good intelligence 
to inspect suspected containers. Information must come from the 
end destination. For example, we will follow up if there is 
information that a consignment is destined for a certain 
location. Several units are involved in following up such 
information, including my office, the police, the customs 
offices, and foreign units. The practice is to perform some 
inspections, but we must ensure that such inspection does not 
create unnecessary trouble for honest businessmen. [passage

  [Text] The suppression drive launched by the Burmese 
government in an area opposite Chiang Rai Province is directed 
against opium warlord Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army (MTA) forces, not 
democratic groups in Shan State, Office of the Narcotics Control 
Board [ONCB] secretary-general Chawalit Yotmani said yesterday. 
  Pol Gen Chawalit said Khun Sa's struggle was not a 
democratic 
cause. 
  He said narcotics traffickers who were recently arrested in 
Chiang Mai Province and had ammunition seized were Khun Sa's 
subordinates and should not be called "fighters for democracy". 
  The ammunition was intended for exchange with drugs, he 
said, 
adding he had no idea where they came from. 
  Academics have proposed that measures be put in place to 
control the ethics of politicians, but Pol Gen Chawalit thought 
the moral standards of MPs could improve gradually. 
  He said it was beyond his responsibilities to comment on 
what 
should be done to prevent politicians from becoming involved in 
the narcotics trade. 
  He also said the committee responsible for drafting the 
anti-money laundering bill had already met once and would meet 
again this Monday. 
  It was agreed at the first meeting that the legislation 
should deal initially with "dirty money" acquired through the 
narcotics trade, he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Burmese Border Situation"] </F>
  [Text] Thailand must keep a close watch on all 
developments in connection with the ongoing fighting between the 
Burmese Government troops and the Shan force under the 
leadership of the world infamous drug kingpin Khun Sa or Chang 
Sifu. This is to avoid falling into any undesirable situation, 
like the case of the fighting in Cambodia--accusations from 
Cambodian leaders. 
  Latest reports indicate that Khun Sa's multiethnic force, 
comprised heavily of armed Shan, Chinese Haw, and Karen 
soldiers, successfully captured the major government stronghold 
in Kengtung on 28 May after 20 hours of fierce battle that 
erupted the day before. 
  It is believed that some 7,000 well-equipped men under Khun 
Sa's command have now gained full control of Kengtung after 
having slain 160 Burmese soldiers and wounded 310 others, while 
2,000 more fled their bases in disarray. 
  Kengtung is situated some 120 kilometers north of the border 
district of Mae Sai, Chiang Rai Province. At present, some 
1,200 Burmese civilians are seeking refuge in the district and 
the number is expected to increase. 
  U.S. narcotics suppression officials have estimated the 
total 
opium production in the areas under Khun Sa's control in 1992 at 
2,280 tons, with the output expected to rise in later years. 
  It should be noted that the route traffickers used to ship 
heroin and opium from the Golden Triangle and nearby areas to 
the world market in the past five years has been shifted from 
Thailand to China. The success of the narcotics suppression 
operation in Thailand has shifted this severe problem into China. 
  It is possible that Khun Sa has been able to sell more 
heroin 
and opium to the world market in the past few years. 
Subsequently, he has been able to improve the efficiency of his 
army in terms of both manpower and equipment. We notice that 
Khun Sa's men easily defeated the Burmese troops in recent 
battles. 
  In any event, Thailand should be aware of problems it can 
have with Burma, a neighboring country like Cambodia. Frequent 
victories by Khun Sa's army over the Burmese Government troops 
can spark off suspicion on part of the Burmese Government as 
Cambodian leaders have always blamed Thailand for every defeat 
their troops have suffered from the Khmer Rouge.

  [Text] Chaing Mai -- Thai and US anti-drug authorities 
yesterday arrested a couple in Muang district with 33 kg of 
heroin worth at least Bt47 million on the local market, police 
said. 
  Somnuk Sisaowarak, 29, and Khruawan Monlai, 39, who are 
natives of Mae Hong Son, were arrested at their house in a 
estate on the Chiang Mai-Hot road with 55 bags of powdered 
heroin and 40 bars of compressed heroin, according to police. 
  The team that raided their house also seized one AK-47 
assault rifle, two pistols and more than 50,000 rounds of M-16 
ammunition. 
  Investigators said the two claimed the heroin came from 
Burmese drug warlord Khun Sa, who wanted to trade the drug for 
arms to be used in fighting with Burmese government forces. 
  Khun Sa's army has been engaged in battles with Rangoon 
which 
have intensified recently. 
  The suspects said they were planning to sell the heroin in 
Bangkok. The proceeds would have been used to buy arms from 
traders at the eastern border. The weapons seized by police 
yesterday were also intended to be sent to the warlord, 
according to police. 
  The raid was carried out jointly by local police, officers 
from the Office of the Narcotics Control Board and agents of the 
US Drug Enforcement Administration.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan has asked the 
Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) and the Bank of 
Thailand to set the scope of the proposed money laundering law 
in a way that will not affect the country's financial system, 
according to government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa. 
  Amnuai told the council of economic ministers on Monday the 
two agencies had also been instructed to consider whether the 
proposed legislation should target drug traffickers alone or 
include other criminal groups as well, Aphisit said. 
  Members of other crime syndicates, such as those involved in 
prostitution and the smuggling of contraband and war weapons, 
are also known to launder their profits through legitimate banks 
and financial institutions using the same methods as drug 
traffickers. 
  Government leaders have said they agree with the proposal by 
anti-narcotics officials to introduce a money laundering law, 
provided that such a move does not infringe on individual 
freedoms. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he approved of the idea in 
principle because a money laundering law would prevent dishonest 
people converting their ill-gotten wealth into legal currencies. 
  Anti-drug officials say that without such a law, drug 
traffickers will continue to flourish through their illegal 
trade. 
  ONCB staff say many major traders in illicit drugs are 
beyond 
the reach of the law because law enforcement officials do not 
have hard evidence to link them to the crime.

  [Text] For Hmong people living in areas where a town 
centre is two days' walk away, opium is certainly a much more 
attractive and practical commodity than peanuts. 
  The Lai Chau provincial cadres have tried, in vain, to 
persuade them to grow peanuts instead of poppies. 
  The Vietnamese authorities find themselves increasingly 
helpless to deal with opium plantations and severe drug 
addiction among ethnic minorities in mountainous regions 
especially Lai Chau and Son La. 
  At the same time, increasing drug abuse in major lowland 
cities such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Hai Phong have pushed 
up demand for raw materials from the mountainous areas. 
  Vietnam has just encountered scenes familiar in northern 
Thailand and is trying to deal with a whole set of issues 
through the similar approach of crop substitution programmes and 
rehabilitating drug addicts while boosting law enforcement. 
  But the absence of laws relating to illicit drugs, combined 
with corruption among law enforcers, an erratic judicial system 
and a generally crumbling law enforcement situation, raise the 
question of how effectively the government will handle this 
issue for which a national programme, as well as an 
anti-narcotics bureau, have only been recently set up. 
  "We have a surplus of decrees and resolutions but what's 
been 
accomplished so far shows a lack of resolve. Police in Cao Bang 
province found 2.8 kilogrammes of opium but the trafficker was 
released after posting a bail of US$20. This is not to talk 
about some depraved policemen receiving bribes from other drug 
traffickers," said a critical article on this issue carried by 
Lao Dong (Labour) which is published by the Confederation of 
Trade Union. 
  It was not until September 1990 that the Lai Chau provincial 
authority took its own initiative to ban opium growing, smoking, 
trade and storage. 
  "We had to introduce the ban because our education campaign 
had failed," said Mai Thi Ly, deputy governor of Lai Chau 
province. She is of ethnic Hmong origin and these people form 
the largest group of opium growers in the region. 
  Last year, the Vietnamese government passed another 
resolution on illicit drugs which prescribed penalties for drug 
abuse and trafficking. 
  "That had very little impact," on the thriving situation in 
Lai Chau, said Mrs Ly in an interview. 
  "We have resorted to different methods of persuasion, urging 
people not to grow opium. The villagers who turn to cash crops 
said it was difficult for them to sell their products. The 
budget we received from Hanoi is strictly for seeds, but there's 
no money for road access," she said. 
  Opium addiction among ethnic minorities in remote provinces, 
especially in the north of Vietnam, is such that "in some 
places, the whole villages smoke opium, the whole families smoke 
opium including some children under 15," according to Deputy 
Minister Phan Thanh Xuan of the National Committee for Ethnic 
Minorities and Mountainous Areas. 
  The Vietnamese government said there were 150,000 drug 
addicts nationwide. Of the 12,000 drug addicts officially 
discovered in Lai Chau province, 1,600 of them were treated. 
  "Drug abuse is much more difficult to do away with than 
poppy 
fields. Of those rehabilitated, we found that most of them 
later return to the habit," said Mrs Ly. 
  In Lai Chau, the local authorities are grappling with the 
budgetary and logistical questions of relocating the provincial 
capital from Lai Chau to Dien Bien Phu. On the fringe of the 
town's only main road construction of the province's only drug 
addicts rehabilitation centre is under way. 
  The centre, located on what used to be the site of a herbal 
medicine clinic, began service in January this year and, so far, 
it has come across one intravenous drug user, according to 
Nguyen Duc Thien, director of the centre. 
  The opium area in Lai Chau province was more than 1,000 
hectares before 1990. Officials put the current estimate at 300 
hectares. Poppy field annihilation squads would roam the region 
during harvest time in September to wipe them out. 
  In the past, opium production and movement had been internal 
in that it satisfied small-scale needs within the province. But 
officials were alarmed to have intercepted for the first time 
last November 190 kilogrammes of opium from Laos en route to 
destinations outside the province. Early this year, another 230 
kilos from across the border was intercepted in Lai Chau. 
  "That stuff was on transit in Lai Chau, destined for Hanoi 
and Hai Phong. Until last November's case, we never found 
locals who moved more than five kilos of opium. In the 230 kilo 
case, the traffickers came from Hai Phong. They started 
operating some rackets here," said Deputy Governor Dy. 
  This is what causes the gravest concern for her. 
  "Local people here don't go to Hanoi to sell, but the people 
from outside, for instance, Hanoi come here to buy." 
  Vietnam is pondering accession to an international treaty on 
illicit drugs. Tracking down international drug cartels has 
been possible so far with cooperation from Interpol. The 
country has recently participated in two ASEAN programmes which 
will be implemented in Vietnam: Antinarcotics information; and 
the parents and children against drug abuse campaign. 
  Vietnam, which has no diplomatic relations with the US, 
hoped 
that one day it could hook up with the vast pool of resources 
and intelligence network of the US Drug Enforcement 
Administration, said Deputy Minister Xuan. 
  "We believe that cooperation with the US DEA would help 
reduce narcotics supply to their country," he said.

  [Text] Hanoi, June 1 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Household use of 
opium as a pain-killer has turned children in some parts of 
Vietnam into hardcore addicts by the time they are adolescents, 
according to a workshop report. 
  Highland families in particular not only use opium for 
barter 
but also as a palliative for all ailments causing addiction at a 
very young age, says the report made available to BERNAMA 
Wednesday. 
  It was the first workshop organised here last week to equip 
Vietnam's communist party key cadres nation-wide with 
communication skills to create public awareness of the country's 
drug problem. 
  The report says that although Vietnam is making progress in 
reducing domestic poppy cultivation, such efforts are frustrated 
by increased smuggling of opium from neighbouring countries. 
  It says the area under poppy cultivation had been reduced to 
3,000 hectares last year from 19,000 hectares in 1985 and opium 
production to 10.5 tonnes from 53.9 tonnes during the same 
period. 
  Now 87 percent or 2,630 hectares of the remaining area under 
poppy is in Ky Son in Nghe An Province bordering Laos. 
  A good number of students in that province had been opium 
addicts since their younger days, the report adds. 
  It also shows that there is still no other lucrative cash 
crop better suited to the area's climate, terrain and soil than 
poppy, it says. (poppy plants produce the base to make heroin). 
  Dumping of psychotropic drugs, high relapse rate (80 
percent) 
among treated addicts and lack of funding for sustained 
campaigns are among the other problems Vietnam is facing in 
fighting drug abuse, it says.

<F P=106> [Article by Pranab Basu: "Central Aid for Drug Courts"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, May 2--The Union government will soon 
launch a centrally-sponsored scheme under which the state 
governments will be extended 50 per cent of the cost of setting 
up special courts to deal with drug traffickers under the 
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. 
  These courts were mandated by the United Nations convention 
on drugs about six years ago. Barring West Bengal and 
Maharashtra--no other states had set up these courts. 
  Recently, the Gujarat government under the late Chimanbhai 
Patel had openly opposed the idea of special courts at the 
meeting of the Western Zonal Council of which the Union home 
minister, Mr S.B. Chavan, is the chairman. This is despite the 
fact that Gujarat has the longest international border with 
Pakistan and also a long coastline. 
  The centrally-sponsored scheme has been taken up following 
requests from many countries that cases of their nationals who 
are in Indian prisons due to drug-related cases be cleared as 
soon as possible, according to reliable sources. The delay in 
clearing these cases also creates human rights problems, the 
Union home ministry is believed to have noted. 
  (Some countries under the European Economic Community are 
believed to have requested the Indian government that their 
nationals in Indian prisons be allowed treatment by private 
physicians to be selected by their embassies.) 
  According to official sources, the maximum number of 
imprisoned foreigners are in Maharashtra where the number of 
pending drug-related cases is a staggering 15,564. The state had 
set up 17 special courts but only seven are in operation due to 
financial constraints. 
  Meanwhile, drug traffickers, terrorists and other smugglers 
have started turning to the western region following the sealing 
of the Indo-Pak border in Rajasthan and Punjab and "stringent 
vigil on the Jammu front," according to home ministry sources. 
  In fact, at the last Western Zonal Council meeting, Mr 
Chavan 
is believed to have told the then Gujarat chief minister, Mr 
Patel, that these elements had started turning to the border in 
Gujarat as the borders in Punjab and Rajasthan were being 
strictly sealed. 
  "The number of pending cases did not give any idea of the 
magnitude of the problem... It was common knowledge that in 
Bombay and other cities these drugs are easily available in the 
markets, schools, colleges and hostels.... This matter should 
not be treated in a routine manner," Mr Chavan is learnt to have 
observed, adding that so far only the peddlers were being 
arrested but the big offenders were left scot-free.

  [Text] London, May 26 (IANS) -- Narco-terrorism has become 
a "fact of life" in Kashmir with militants distributing drugs to 
get new recruits, a prominent human rights activist from the 
State has said. 
  Dr Zeenat Naquatee said a Kashmiri youth had been trapped by 
terrorists. "I know of drugs being distributed from mosques to 
recruit boys," she said. 
  "One youth is made an addict and he is told he will get the 
drug if he recruits ten others. Narco-terrorism is a fact of 
life in parts of the Kashmir Valley," Dr Naquatee who is from 
Srinagar, said. "Many among the youth had gone insane. They 
can't believe what they have done," she added. 
  Dr Naquatee, who is here for a Commonwealth Youth 
Conference, 
was speaking to journalists yesterday. 
  She said youths had been taken across the border with 
promises of jobs and money. "They have been forced to write 
letters saying all is well with them" she said. "But when the 
truth has come home, these turned out to be horror stories," she 
said. 
  She said now many Kashmiri Muslims are fleeing the Valley to 
escape forced recruitment by terrorists. The youth are getting 
disillusioned with terrorism, she said. "So foreigners are 
coming from Afghanistan, Sudan and Pakistan. These people are 
now killing Kashmiris in Kashmir" Dr Naquatee said. 
  She said "the terrorists speak of a freedom struggle. (But) 
did Indians kill Indians when they were struggling for freedom?" 
She said the terrorists have brought problems for everyone. 
"It's dark in our homes. We can't go out. We don't know when 
firing, killing will happen," she said. 
  Talking about women, Dr Naquatee said they have become the 
worst victims of terrorism in the State. But she regretted that 
nobody is talking about the human rights of women. 
  "Women have no freedom of action or movement, no education, 
no medical care. Women have seen their sons snatched away to 
join terrorists, their husbands forced to give money at 
gunpoint," she said. There have been too many "forced 
marriages," she said, adding that everyone knows about these. 
  "For whose independence are the terrorists fighting? For 
that of terrorists trained across the border? Independence 
movements come from the people and not from a handful of trained 
terrorists," she said. The world had seen movements against 
Communism. India had seen its independence struggle. "These 
movements came from the people who did not need to be trained 
across any border," Dr Naquatee said. 
  Dr Naquatee said the real problem was in Pakistan Occupied 
Kashmir (PoK). "Unlike us, people there do not know what 
democracy means" she said. Kashmiris had a peaceful alliance 
with India, she said. "Otherwise people would have called 
Sheikh Abdullah a traitor" she said. 
  Pakistan was killing Kashmiris in the name of Islam and 
within Pakistan was dividing Muslims among themselves, she 
alleged. Within Kashmir, she said, the majority did not want 
Pakistan. "The trouble in any case is only in three or four 
districts within Jammu and Kashmir," she said. 
  Terrorists would oppose elections because the gun has given 
them power she said. "When they want money, when they want 
something done by a bureaucrat, when they want something from a 
shop, they get it at gunpoint," she said. But people wanted 
elections, she said. "People need someone they can go and talk 
to, someone who will back them," she said. "The majority is 
being ordered around by a minority with guns," she said. 
  She said the people were caught between the terrorists and 
the security forces. But the trouble had been started by 
terrorists, she said. "The security forces have been there 
since 1947. They have been protecting us since then. We had no 
problem with them all these years," she said. The security 
forces have a problem in identifying terrorists, she said. "If 
there had been no sponsored terrorism, there would have been no 
excesses," Dr Naquatee said.

    [Editorial Report] Writing on page 21 of Tel Aviv MA'ARIV 
in Hebrew on 4 May, Uri Arazi reports that on 3 May, Sharon 
District policemen "arrested 30 people in the Netanya area, 
including several women, suspected of trafficking in `heavy' 
drugs. In the carefully planned raid, the police seized large 
quantities of drugs" and "arrested a resident of Netanya known 
to be one of the largest drug dealers in Israel." 
  A report by Raine Marcus on page 12 of Jerusalem THE 
JERUSALEM POST on 17 May notes that Tel Aviv narcotics squad 
detectives "seized liquefied cocaine disguised as Colombian 
coffee liqueur, worth around $700,000, allegedly smuggled here 
from Colombia by international drug traffickers." Detectives 
arrested 30-year-old suspected courier Moti Spiegel at 
Ben-Gurion Airport. Spiegel's partner, 23-year-old Tamir 
Peretz, and Miguel Octavio, a 32-year-old Colombian who has been 
in Israel three months, were arrested in the Tel Aviv area and 
remanded in custody for 11 days. 
  Writing on page 3 of Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST on 25 May, 
Raine Marcus reports that in their second raid in five months of 
the Abu-Sayf clan's Yafo orange groves, "police arrested four 
family members early yesterday morning, after an undercover 
agent taped drug transactions." Marcus adds that in an 
operation dubbed "Black Night," detectives also arrested two 
members of Yafo's Daka clan, and four other alleged dealers. 
Nearly 20,000 shekels in cash, "which police believe to be 
profits from drug trading, was found in their possession. 
Traces of white powder and scales were found in one apartment." 
The report goes on to say that the 47-year-old undercover 
agent, a Yafo drug addict "with several charges pending against 
him, agreed to work for police in return for the closing of the 
cases and payment." 
  Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 26 May, in a page 15 report by 
David Zohar, reports that "the Israeli drug trade totals $2.5 
billion a year. The annual damage accruing to the market by the 
use of drugs--according to Beni Arad, chairman of the Anti-Drug 
Authority--amounts to 33 billion shekels." According to Arad 
some 200,000 Israelis, including 27,000 high school students, 
use drugs. Some 33,000 of the users are addicted to heroin. 
Arad says that the annual consumption of heroin in Israel 
amounts to between 3-4 tons; 4 tons hashish, and half a ton 
cocaine. 
  A report by Yosi Levi on the same page of MA'ARIV states 
that 
"the Jerusalem police have uncovered a sophisticated ring of 
drug smugglers from the United States. The ring was headed by 
Asher Abutbul, 31, who has resided in Manhattan for the last 15 
years." The report adds that the Jerusalem police have seized 11 
shipments of cocaine addressed to various people in Jerusalem 
and Ramat Gan. Altogether 125 grams of cocaine valued at 
approximately $15,000 were seized.

  [Text] This morning customs officials at Beirut airport 
foiled an attempt to smuggle a quantity of drugs into Lebanon. 
  Husayn 'Ali al-Sahili, born in 1973 in Kafr Zabad in 
al-Biqa', was arrested upon his arrival from Colombia via 
Amsterdam, and 2,250 grams of cocaine were seized with him. The 
drugs were hidden in an innovative and technical way--inside a 
case with a false bottom and inside two nylon envelopes. The 
case passed, undetected, through X-ray machines in European 
airports. Al-Sahili was arrested and referred to the 
counternarcotics office. 
  The local value of the seized drug was estimated at $70,000 
and estimated at $5,000 in Colombia.

  [Text] The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, has 
drawn up a master plan to involve all Nigerians in the fight 
against hard drugs. The chairman of the agency, Brigadier 
General Musa Bamayi, gave the information today in Lagos when he 
led members of the task force on hard drugs on a courtesy visit 
to the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria, FRCN. 
  Brig Gen. Bamayi stated that the primary focus of the master 
plan would be on prevention to stop Nigerians from becoming drug 
addicts. He said that arrangements were being finalized to 
enable media representatives to monitor the activities of NDLEA 
as part of efforts to demonstrate that the agency would not 
operate in secrecy in its assignments. 
  Responding, the executive director of FRCN Lagos national 
station, Mr. Ikenna Ndaguba, who received the team on behalf of 
the director general, Alhaji Abdulraman Michika, stressed the 
importance of the media in prosecuting the drug war. He pledged 
the continued cooperation of Radio Nigeria in reaching the 
public effectively with antidrug programs of the agency.

  [Text] The Swaziland police have confiscated their biggest 
haul of mandrax. The mandrax has an estimated street value of 
about $5 million. It was packed in plastic bags hidden in 
containers on a truck that had entered the country at the 
Lomahasha border post in the north. Sources say that the 
Lomahasha area has become a favorite route for smugglers of 
drugs and arms from Mozambique. Apparently these are destined 
for South Africa.

<F P=106> [Edmond Laci commentary: "Heroin in Durres: 500 Grams of </F>
Confiscated Drugs"] 
  [Text] Durres -- Up till now, there have been only 
investigations and suspicions, but now here is the proof: 
heroin traffic also passes via Albania. Last Friday evening, 
the biggest-ever quantity of the white powder to be caught was 
confiscated in the city of Durres. During a surprise search 
near the beach at Durres, the forces of public order discovered 
around 500 grams of heroin in a person's private car. A few 
hours later, after this person's immediate arrest, two other 
persons were detained; an intensive search was still going on. 
  The first announcements--albeit very reserved ones--confirm 
that the person from whom the big quantity of heroin was 
confiscated was a man of 40, working in the Mercantile Marine of 
Durres and a resident of Kavaja. Meanwhile, other sources from 
Kavaja report that later the same evening, the forces of public 
order carried out a minute search of the man's house. Anyhow, 
there is no report of any new quantity of drugs having been 
confiscated since then, although--due to the top secrecy of the 
investigations--no other details relevant to this action, 
carried out by the forces of order, were given. It is clear 
that this discovery was preceded by long-running investigation 
work that succeeded in coming to fruition only last Friday 
evening. The fact that two other persons were detained is 
another sign that makes us believe that, in this case, we are 
dealing with a whole network of drug traffickers, whose 
tentacles in Albania have just been revealed. Thus the 
hypothesis presented--especially in recent times--of various 
persons within the Albanian territory being involved in the 
international drug traffic is thoroughly confirmed. On 9 March 
1993, 10 grams of heroin and 53 small bottles of cocaine were 
confiscated, again in Durres, in the facilities of the Italian 
"Pellicano" Operation. The then vice-interior minister, Mehja, 
told GAZETA SHQIPTARE at that time of "the capture of the first 
Albanian drugs trafficker." Today--only one year later--a 50 
times greater quantity of the best selling and most sought-after 
drug, which can fetch the price of $700,000 in the West, was 
discovered. It is not known yet whether this quantity of drugs 
belonged to any contingent intended to reach the Italian shores, 
or whether it was designed for domestic use. Yet that it was 
intended for trade remains the most certain hypothesis, because 
half a kilogram of heroin could not possibly be used by an 
ordinary drug-addicted maniac alone. 
  Only one week prior to last Friday, the Italian authorities 
announced the detection of an international network of drug 
traffickers and the confiscation of 40 kg of heroin that was 
meant to pass via Albania to the Italian drug market. 
Besides--according to the Italian specialist--the existence of 
a mobile heroin refinery--moving to and fro, stationed now in 
Albania, now in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM]--was confirmed. Nevertheless--unless a 
complete investigation is carried out, it cannot be ascertained 
that the quantity sequestrated in Albania belongs to the 
aforementioned drug refinery and network.

  [Text] Prague, May 30 (CTK) -- Expert estimates say that 
the Czech Republic has between 50,000 and 60,000 drug addicts, 
Petr Lom, a correspondent for the parliamentary health and 
social committee, says in an interview published in today's 
edition of the Czech daily RUDE PRAVO. 
  For example, one in three of an estimated 60,000 prostitutes 
sooner or later ends up on drugs; besides, there are 2,000 drug 
addicts among the prison population and the drug abuse 
consulting centers file another several thousand people, Lom 
says. 
  Although people can now get all kinds of drug, surveys have 
lately been neglected. Addicts themselves take to drug 
trafficking in order to gain access to drugs; they dilute them 
for sales and take some themselves at the same time. However, 
the heroin being found among users is quite concentrated, which 
shows that re-selling chains are still short, the paper says. 
The Czechs still have no law banning the free sale of drug 
precursors, that is medicines such as ephedrine, it adds. 
  The inter-ministry narcotics commission with district 
branches, aimed at coordinating the fight against drugs, has not 
come up with any concrete results so far, the paper says, adding 
that the commission only has an advisory capacity. 
  The customs as well as other Interior Ministry departments, 
jealously guard their independence, and their cooperation with 
the Interpol and the national narcotics information center is 
only voluntary. 
  The Drop-In rehabilitation centers for drug addicts also 
struggle against the odds, with diolane, a simulation drug with 
a short-term effect, being the only tool at their disposal. 
Ways of monitoring the diolane-based abstinence treatment are 
non-satisfactory, the paper says. 
  Another shortcoming is the fact that the Health Ministry 
only 
monitors the consumption of drugs and has no controlling 
authority over their production and distribution. The present 
Anti-Narcotics Bureau is just an office within the health 
ministry, but if we are serious in wanting to protect the 
country against the drug trade, steps must be taken to unite 
drug-fighting efforts at home and bring the anti-narcotics 
agencies closer to the drug-producing scene in countries not far 
from the Czech Republic, such as Ukraine, Hungary and Poland, 
and plot the routes plied by the drug trade, Lom says in RUDE 
PRAVO.

<F P=106> [Report by Christoph Matzl: "Dealers Shot Commemorative </F>
Pictures of Their Drug Deals!"] 
  [Text] The six members of a narcotics gang were making a 
quick buck by dealing in heroin. After their coups, the dealers 
proudly shot "commemorative photographs": With a gun in one 
hand, a portable telephone in the other, and pockets full of 
thousand schilling notes. Now they have had their pictures 
taken by the narcotics police--for the criminal files.... 
  The two 21-year-old Turks Yilmaz A. and Ibrahim A. wanted to 
enter the big drug scene as heroin dealers. After having 
supplied the drugs to several addicts at Vienna's Karlsplatz, 
they wanted to sell heroin worth 200,000 schillings in a cafe at 
Brunnenmarkt in Vienna's Ottakring district. 
  Yet, the people who went there were not clients, but 
officers 
of the Lower Austrian narcotics police who arrested the men. 
During the interrogation, police got the address of the 
headquarters of the narcotics gang. 
  In a surprise action, the policemen stormed the apartment, 
rounding up three further gang members after a wild fight: 
Macedonians Nehat S. (20), Destan D. (20), and Memet A. (26). 
Apart from the drugs, the police also found pictures the heroin 
dealers had taken of one another....

<F P=106> [Report by Khriso Andoniadhou] </F>
  [Text] Cyprus is being used as a transit point for dirty 
money. Offshore companies, which are linked directly to 
countries where dirty money is rife, use Cyprus to legalize 
their unlawful actions. Although the Central Bank has 
repeatedly sent circulars to commercial banks to avoid use of 
the banking system services for dirty money purposes, no oney 
can know whether and to what extent dirty money moves in Cyprus 
through banks that operate here. Central Bank Governor Avxendis 
Avxendiou's assurances that no dirty money moves through Cyprus 
are unconvincing. This is because government departments are 
investigating files of evidence about offshore companies with 
"mysterious" dealings and "ghost" transactions. It appears 
clear in specific cases that Cyprus is also used by swindlers to 
facilitate transiting their money through clean channels in 
Cyprus to European banks. 
  I SIMERINI has seen a Central Bank document which shows the 
ways that offshore banks launder dirty money. The following are 
the main ways: 

  -  --New customers open an account after being recommended by 
a branch abroad or another bank whose headquarters is in a 
country where the production, trafficking, or trade of narcotics 
are well known. 
  -  --The use of credits or other means of trade financing to 
move 
money between countries when such trade is incompatible with the 
usual business activities of the customer. 
  -  --Customers who make regular, large payments, including 
electronic remittances, when it cannot be established that such 
transactions are made "in good faith" or when the customers 
regularly collect large amounts from countries involved in the 
production, processing, or trafficking of narcotics. 
  -  --The creation of big credit balances in accounts when this 
is 
incompatible with the known profit of the customer's business 
and when, later on, these balances are transferred to accounts 
abroad. 
  -  --Electronic inflows and simultaneous outflows of money by 
customers without these transactions passing through a specific 
account. 
  -  --Frequent applications for the issuance of traveler's 
checks, 
foreign exchange checks, or other negotiable means of payment. 
  -  --Frequent deposits of traveler's checks and foreign exchange 
checks coming from abroad. 
  -  --Numerous and frequent incoming electronic remittances to a 
specific account.

  [Text] The drugs police in Helsinki have uncovered the 
biggest criminal drug ring in Finland so far. A gang, which has 
been operating systematically, has smuggled hashish, 
amphetamines, and heroin to Finland, apparently for a couple of 
years. According to the drugs police, the substances were 
brought to Finland mainly from the Netherlands. So far the 
police have confiscated 35 kg of hashish and small amounts of 
amphetamines and heroin. The total quantity of drugs is not yet 
known, but it appears that hundreds of kilos of hashish have 
been imported. A large number of various property crimes and an 
extensive economic crime ring are linked to the now uncovered 
case. Police have arrested 25 people in connection with the 
case. According to the police, most of those involved in the 
smuggling come from the capital region.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ulrich Maurer, Social Democratic Party of </F>
Germany, SPD chief Rudolf Scharping's political spokesman, by 
Wulf Reimer; place and date not given: "The Debate On 10 Or 30 
Grams Of Drugs Is Relatively Absurd"] 
  [Text] [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Mr. Maurer, the 
Constitutional Court ruling on drugs has created more confusion 
than understanding, including, it would seem, inside the SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany]. 
  [Maurer] Yes. We have had a somewhat incohesive debate over 
the past few weeks, a debate that I fail to understand. The 
conclusions we reached at our party congress in November 1993 
are clear. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] People in your party have been upset 
even more by Duesseldorf Justice Minister Krumsiek's pledge that 
the possession of up to 10 grams of hashish and as much as 0.5 
grams of heroin would be permitted by law. 
  [Maurer] I fail to understand this move. We agreed on the 
application of the opportunity principle, whereby, as far as 
hard drugs are concerned, each individual case should be 
assessed according to its merits. In addition, I believe that a 
controlled dosage of opiates can only be tolerated in the case 
of medical treatment. Were we to permit the use of hard drugs 
even in non- medical cases, we would open all the floodgates. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Why is the SPD incapable of 
introducing uniform rules on drugs, at least in the laender it 
controls? 
  [Maurer] The party's resolutions are clear. Since 
Wiesbaden, we have been in favor of legalizing the consumption 
of cannabis products. But the situation is quite different with 
dealers. In this case I insist on tough penalties. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Are you in favor of an exact 
definition of the meaning of a "reasonable quantity" of "soft" 
drugs? Stuttgart Minister President Erwin Teugel thinks it is 
not necessary. 
  [Maurer] We are determined to adhere to the rulings of the 
supreme German court, whereby first of all the laender must 
reach agreement at justice minister level on a joint legal 
policy, and later reach a similar agreement at minister 
president level. This is of course only possible when one has 
first of all decided what exactly constitutes a small amount of 
drugs. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But what does the SPD consider to be 
an acceptable maximum amount? 
  [Maurer] Right now I consider a debate on 10 or 30 grams of 
drugs rather absurd. I think one should accept the opinion of 
experienced drug therapists. Apart from that, I did not wish to 
forestall consultations by the relevant ministers. Even so, one 
will have to reach an agreement on a common line, or else one 
will not be able to implement the rulings of the Constitutional 
Court. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What will the SPD do to free the 
police from the unbearable situation of no longer having to 
punish people for possessing and using drugs because the state 
prosecution will frequently waive criminal proceedings? 
  [Maurer] That is the scandal right now. We are tying down 
enormous police forces that we would otherwise use to combat 
dealers and drug criminals. The legality principle has so far 
been compelling policemen to draw up copious reports and 
protocols that the state prosecutions, even in 
Christian-Democratic Union laender, have subsequently thrown 
into the waste paper basket. In future, the police should 
concentrate on the dealers and especially on the structure of 
organized crime. The police must have the possibility of 
referring drug addicts directly to treatment centers. In this 
way, hard-drug consumers could be rescued from the world of 
crime and from the compulsion of street prostitution. They 
could be rescued from a miserable life that causes great social 
damage. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Then the police no longer has to 
bother with "junkies"? 
  [Maurer] If we establish a common policy on soft drugs in 
accordance with the Constitutional Court ruling, it will be 
clear to the police that it will no longer have to bother with 
drugs. As for punishment for the consumption of hard drugs, I 
think one should apply the opportunity principle. The police, 
together with state prosecutions, must decide whether or not a 
case, for example one involving dealers, should be closely 
investigated, or, to give another example, whether or not one is 
dealing with an addict who needs treatment.

<F P=106> ["vs"-initialed report: "North Rhine-Westphalian Government </F>
Sticks To Narcotics Guidelines"] 
  [Excerpt] Duesseldorf, 2 June -- The Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] majority in the Landtag of North 
Rhine-Westphalia [NRW] has rejected the request brought forth by 
the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the Free Democratic 
Party of Germany [FDP] to withdraw its "narcotics guideline," 
which has caused public controversy and which requests the 
prosecuting authorities to take identical action against 
consumers of small amounts of hard and soft drugs. In a special 
session of the landtag, Justice Minister Rolf Krumsiek, and 
Health Minister Franz Muentefering, who is responsible for the 
narcotics policy, said the reasons for sticking to the 
"provisional guidelines" on the identical application of 
Paragraph 31a of the Narcotics Law in North Rhine-Westphalia was 
that the decree was "consistent with the law on all points, 
well-balanced, and well founded on substance." The opposition 
has denied that. The SPD and the Greens have accused the CDU 
and the FDP of having created insecurity among the public 
through "deliberately wrong information." The land government 
was acting in line with the law because it did not legalize 
drugs and because possession of drugs will continue to be an 
offense in North Rhine-Westphalia, the SPD and Greens said.

  [Excerpt] Two American drug dealers who distributed huge 
amounts of cocaine throughout Britain for a Colombian cartel 
were each jailed for a total of 16 years yesterday. 
  David Lemieux and Thomas O'Donnell, arrested after the 
world's biggest international drugs-busting operation, were told 
they had contributed to the "problems of addiction, damage to 
health, and poverty and crime". 
  The two men, both 41, who face extradition to the United 
States and the prospect of further jail terms after completing 
their sentences in Britain, had engaged in "very big crime 
indeed", said Judge Brian Pryor QC, passing sentence at Woolwich 
crown court in London. 
  Forty-three kilos of cocaine worth more than &pound;7 
million 
had been seized, he said, but it was likely at least as much 
again was sold after being smuggled into Britain nearly two 
years ago. 
  Almost &pound;2 million was handed over by them to Customs 
and 
Excise undercover men, whom the judge praised for their efforts 
in bringing the men to justice. A further &pound;1.5 million was 
recovered from the homes of the two accused and associates. 
  Mr Lemieux, whose US address was never found, admitted two 
charges of supplying cocaine in the autumn of 1992, two of 
concealing the proceeds of drug trafficking, one of attempting 
to conceal proceeds and one of transferring drug cash out of 
Britain. 
  Mr O'Donnell, whose address in the US is also unknown, 
pleaded guilty to one charge of supply, one of transferring 
drugs money abroad and two of concealing cocaine cash. 
  Also before the court was Briton Howard Edwards, aged 40, 
who 
sailed Mr Lemieux across the Atlantic to the Isle of Wight in 
his yacht in August 1992, so the drugs ring could be launched. 
Thousands of pounds of his part in the pay-off were found at his 
parents' home just outside Merthyr Tydfil, Mid Glamorgan, South 
Wales. 
  He admitted one charge of concealing drug trafficking 
proceeds and was jailed for three years nine months. 
  The judge told the men, none of whom had any previous 
convictions, that he was satisfied that between them they had 
benefited by more than &pound;6 million from their illegal 
activities. 
  Only &pound;960,800 of that was realisable against Mr 
Lemieux 
and he ordered that sum to be confiscated. Mr O'Donnell was told 
he would have to forfeit &pound;536,375 and Mr Edwards 
&pound;90,000. 
  After the case, Ron Harris, assistant chief investigation 
officer for the Customs and Excise drugs financial investigation 
branch, said the international operation had involved eight 
countries. It was the first time so many drug enforcement 
agencies had pooled their resources in a single operation. 
  "It was an unparalleled display of openness," he said. 
"Traditional barriers of `need to know' secrecy were broken 
down, while at the same time preserving the overall integrity of 
the many strands of this operation." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Erlend Clouston: "Scots Drug Abuse `Costs </F>
&pound;1bn a Year'"; first paragraph is THE GUARDIAN 
introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Erlend Clouston reports on a Commons inquiry 
that suggests a third of Scots in their early twenties could be 
experimenting with drugs, and talks to an addict about his 
lifestyle. 
  Drug abuse in Scotland is costing the taxpayer almost 
&pound;1 
billion a year--25 times the official calculation. 
  A report by the all-party Scottish Affairs Committee 
released 
yesterday suggests that up to one-third of Scots in their early 
twenties could be experimenting with various drugs; 20,000 
people are thought to be injecting illicit substances--11,000 in 
Greater Glasgow alone, including almost half the children in one 
Strathclyde secondary school class. Funding an injected 
addiction is said to cost a weekly average of &pound;300. 
  The report recommends wider provision of synthetic opiates 
and an education programme to tackle Scotland's growing drug 
crisis. 
  The committee estimates that, taking into account theft, 
interdiction, prisons and treatment, drug abuse north of the 
border is costing the taxpayer &pound;936 million annually. 
  "It is a much more serious and extensive problem than any of 
us imagined," said committee chairman Willie McKelvey, Labour MP 
for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, at yesterday's launch of a document 
that has taken seven months to prepare and involved the 11 
members in visits to the Netherlands and the United States. 
  Up to 90 per cent of young people attending raves are 
thought 
to be using Ecstasy, LSD or amphetamines. Temazepam, a 
pharmaceutical painkiller, has become one of the favourite 
opiates of "the least well educated and post-socially 
disadvantaged as groups of mis-users". An Edinburgh GP told the 
committee that his surgery's prescription of the drug had risen 
by 131 per cent recently. 
  However, the report drew back from making a direct link 
between poverty and drug-taking, preferring to talk of a 
correlation rather than a causal relationship. 
  The recommendation that the substitute drug methadone be 
made 
more freely available by health boards was the most 
controversial aspect of the report. It cited a US study which 
showed that the crime rate among a group of 491 addicts on a 
methadone course had dropped by 79 per cent. While acknowledging 
that it was the perfect solution, the report found that the 
advantages of the "soft landing" approach--no injecting, and 
addicts kept in touch with the support agencies--were too great 
to be ignored. [passage omitted] 
  To alert potential drug consumers to the dangers--57 per 
cent 
of Lothian HIV sufferers contracted the virus from infected 
needles--the committee called for an education programme 
starting at primary school. Mr McKelvey said many Scottish 
mothers were "fraught with despair in some areas as all their 
kids are at risk". 
  Finding an effective solution will not be easy. Both 
"shock-horror" and neutral information packages distributed in 
the Netherlands have provoked a rise in the level of drug-taking. 
  The committee obliquely criticised the police for failing to 
do more to impound the possessions of drug dealers. In 1992 the 
authorities in England and Wales seized assets worth &pound;16 
million. In the same year the Scottish forces confiscated goods 
and property worth &pound;28,440. "The Association of Chief 
Police 
Officers accepted that the police had not been up to speed on 
the issue," the report records.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Tsekhanov, chief of the Federal </F>
Counterintelligence Service's Economic Counterintelligence 
Directorate, by Vladimir Klimov "only in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA"; 
date and place not given: "The Country Is Being Sold Off. 
Wholesale and Retail. Directorate Chief Vladimir Tsekhanov 
Reflects on the Struggle on the Economic Front"] 
  [Excerpts] [Klimov] What is the main sphere of questions 
that the Economic Counterintelligence Directorate is working on? 
  [Tsekhanov] The might, stability, and prosperity of a state 
are determined by the condition of its economy. But at the same 
time this is a state's tenderest, most sensitive spot. It is no 
accident that the developed countries' special services are 
shifting the center of gravity in their activity to the economic 
sphere. 
  The Economic Counterintelligence Directorate, which was the 
result of the amalgamation of two Russian Security Ministry 
directorates (the directorate for combating contraband and 
corruption and, partly, the economic security directorate), 
endeavors to organize the protection of vitally important 
spheres most at risk from external and internal threats. 
  These are above all priority state programs, including 
privatization, investment projects with federal status and 
foreign investors, the credit and finance sphere, foreign 
economic activity, and the sphere of the circulation of precious 
stones and metals. Such forms of economic crime as the 
smuggling of strategic raw materials and centrally allocated 
resources, the illegal arms trade, banking crimes--including the 
laundering of huge sums obtained through criminal 
means--represent a serious threat. International narcotics 
syndicates are making a beeline for Russia. The theft and 
resale of cultural assets and unlawful enterprise in the sphere 
of culture are becoming profitable business. The expansion of 
organized crime and its capital in the Russian economy has taken 
on threatening proportions. Such trends are directly connected 
with the growth of corruption in the organs of power and 
administration and the law-enforcement system. [passage omitted] 
  [Klimov] One area of the directorate's activity is 
corruption in the higher echelons of power. It is already known 
that instances of the criminal abuse of power have been 
uncovered. Is it possible for you to speak about this? 
  [Tsekhanov] Corruption in the state service system is 
reaching epidemic proportions, discrediting the economic reforms 
and exerting a destructive influence on our way of life, our 
sense of justice, legality, and the social protection of our 
citizens. 
  In St. Petersburg criminal proceedings have been instituted 
against L. Savenkov, the city's deputy mayor, for organized 
smuggling. In Moscow V. Danilenko, the first deputy prefect of 
Moscow's Western Administrative District, has been charged with 
corruption. 
  In Pskov Oblast A. Kabanov, deputy chairman of the Oblast 
Committee for the Management of State Property, has been 
detained for organizing the illicit export of metals and import 
of arms. Unfortunately there are many such examples. 
  It is extremely difficult for the law-enforcement organs to 
investigate and stamp out corruption among leading officials. 
All the advantages of office and influence and connections in 
the top-ranking executive echelons are brought into play in 
order to oppose our work. Often the mass media are exploited to 
distort the nature of events or exert pressure on the 
law-enforcement organs investigating cases of corruption. 
  Sometimes curbing corruption among judges, public 
prosecutors, and deputies is seriously hampered by the 
excessively inflated guarantees of immunity of these officials. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Klimov] How extensively has economic crime affected the 
law-enforcement organs? 
  [Tsekhanov] For the militia it is most difficult of all. 
Organized crime today possesses huge financial and material 
resources, is excellently technically equipped, and has great 
experience of opposition to the state. Not everyone can 
withstand such pressure. There are cases of betrayal of 
official interests, official abuses, mergers with criminal 
structures, illegal participation in entrepreneurial activity, 
and assistance in getting criminal proceedings dropped in return 
for bribes. For example, one month ago the illegal activity of 
an extensive criminal community with the participation of 
officers of the central apparatus of the MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs], the Moscow Oblast and City Internal Affairs 
Main Directorates, and other militia subdepartments was 
uncovered. Orders from professional criminal groupings of the 
Moscow region to drop charges against their members under 
investigation for muggings, robbery, smuggling, and illegal 
possession of arms, and also to change preventive restrictions 
and reduce sentences imposed by the courts, were carried out in 
return for huge bribes. Criminal proceedings have been 
instituted, and the case has been referred to the Russian 
General Prosecutor's Office. 
  In 1993 alone, according to the records of the former 
Russian 
Federation Security Ministry, criminal proceedings were 
instituted against 39 officers of MVD organs, one Prosecutor's 
Office employee, and one court official, and more than 1,000 
employees of the internal affairs organs were disciplined for 
various abuses of public office. In the first quarter of 1994, 
according to federal counterintelligence records, criminal 
charges have been brought in nine cases against 14 MVD officers. 
There are four cases against officials of the Public 
Prosecutor's Office. 
  There is information on extortion of bribes by individual 
officials of the tax police for reducing punitive sanctions. 
Some of these officials have links with criminal structures and 
carry out their orders, passing to them official information and 
helping individual entrepreneurs to tax exemptions, receiving 
huge sums in return. There are cases of threats and 
psychological pressure against taxpayers and cases of forcing 
them to give bribes. 
  [Klimov] The narcotics trade is growing drastically in 
Russia. What is being done to oppose it? 
  [Tsekhanov] According to official estimates the turnover of 
narcotics reached the level of $150 million in our country last 
year. More than half of the narcotics in illegal circulation in 
Russia originate from outside its borders. They come mainly 
from Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Lithuania, and the Central 
Asian states. 
  In recent times contraband deliveries of narcotics from 
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran have grown markedly. Cocaine 
from South America and the United States and other narcotics, 
new to this country, are increasingly appearing in Russia. On 
the other hand the smuggling of narcotics from Russia to 
Finland, Sweden, France, Germany, Austria, and Greece is on the 
increase. 
  The international narcotics business has manifestly 
intensified its interest in Russia. This is to be explained by 
the peculiarities of Russia's geographic position on the 
crossroads of transport routes and the huge, though as yet 
[un]exploited, market in the demand for narcotics. There is 
reason to believe that, in addition to the traditional Balkan 
and Caucasus routes, a new international drugs route is being 
established from Southwest, South, and Southeast Asia to the CIS 
countries and West Europe. 
  One means of increasing effectiveness in the battle against 
the illegal circulation of narcotics is cooperation with the 
special services of a number of countries of the world. Of 
course, collaboration within the CIS receives priority 
attention. [passage omitted] 
  [Klimov] What danger awaits us from the commercialization of 
the entire country? 
  [Tsekhanov] A "flight" of the ruble, whereby foreign 
currency actively penetrates the sphere of circulation and the 
ruble is squeezed out of internal circulation. The second 
calamity is a leak of capital from Russia. This question can be 
resolved only by combining administrative measures with the 
creation of an attractive investment climate. Plus legislative 
support. 
  And there is one further highly complex problem--the 
concentration of huge sums of money in the hands of individuals 
and organizations having direct links with the criminal world. 
There is an ongoing process of laundering "dirty" money, both 
from Russia and abroad, and the active assimilation of private 
funds into the Russian economy through the establishment of 
control over commercial banking structures. 
  Many confidence tricksters and fraudsters, both Russian and 
foreign, have now appeared in the Russian market. The 
successfully thwarted losses which could have been inflicted by 
these dishonest people are frequently measured in tens of 
billions of rubles. Major financial fraud cannot fail to affect 
the condition of the state credit and monetary system. 
  [Klimov] Vladimir Stepanovich, what prevents even more 
effective work by your directorate? 
  [Tsekhanov] Dissatisfaction with the level of social 
protection and the uncertainty of the status of a state Federal 
Counterintelligence Service employee, the unending process of 
reorganization--all this substantially reduces our level of 
efficiency and drives away professional cadres. Many trained 
officers have gone into the tax police, where the level of 
monetary support is far higher than in our directorate, and into 
other state structures. Commercial firms happily take on our 
boys, sometimes offering pay several times in excess of what 
they were previously earning. Former state security employees 
are valued for their high efficiency, professionalism, and 
ability to perform the most diverse tasks, and, of course, for 
their honesty and reliability.

  [Text] Vice President Yerik Asanbayev received yesterday 
Giorgio Giacomelli, UN deputy secretary general and executive 
director of the UN fund for drug abuse. Under discussion was 
the issue of combatting drug smuggling. Giorgio Giacomelli said 
new sovereign states that appeared on the world's map after the 
break-up of the USSR are now turning into drug dealing centers. 
They also discussed the UN policy with regard to this issue. 
The vice president spoke about Kazakhstan's vision of its 
participation in the UN programme. Yerik Asanbayev emphasized 
that drug smuggling has to be addressed urgently. He said 
Kazakhstan has turned into a drug trading center, but does not 
have the equipment and experts to combat it. Therefore 
Kazakhstan would be grateful for any assistance that could be 
rendered to it by international organizations. This year 
Kazakhstan plans to send its envoy to Vienna who will deal with 
this issue. Kazakhstan is willing to cooperate with the United 
Nations in tackling this issue.

  [Text] A press-conference on drug smuggling issues has been 
held at the Internal Affairs Ministry. It was attended by 
Giorgio Giacomelli, the UN deputy secretary general and 
executive director of the UN's fund for drug abuse. His visit 
to Kazakhstan could be explained by a tendency for establishing 
relations between Kazakhstan's drug dealers and that of the CIS 
and foreign countries. Last year 197 foreigners were detained 
for illegal drug dealing in Kazakhstan. Internal Affairs 
Minister Vladimir Shumov said that Kazakhstan has the material 
that is needed for illegal production of hashish type drugs. We 
are worried about the substantial increase in influx of Opium 
type drugs to Kazakhstan from Russia, Ukraine, Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The fact that two-thirds of drug 
addicts are young people in their 20's is also of great concern. 
This is the reason why we decided to take tougher steps in 
combatting it. 
  Giacomelli noted that it is impossible to combat drug 
smuggling single-handed. Therefore, the United Nations puts 
forward its own comprehensive program aimed at stopping drug 
trafficking. The United Nations' goal is to join the efforts of 
different countries in addressing these problems. Conditions 
should be created that will make drug cultivation unprofitable. 
With this aim in mind relevant international trade legislation 
has to be adopted. Touching upon the subject of UN assistance to 
Kazakhstan, Giacomelli said that this will depend on a number of 
things. The United Nations intends to grant Kazakhstan $0.5 
million under this program.

  [Text] Last year experts of Kazakhstan's customs 
confiscated around 10 kg of drugs from passengers, and over a 
period of four months of the current year they have seized 133 
kg. This fact was quoted during a roundtable discussion 
organized by law enforcement bodies at Almaty's friendship 
house. Drugs made of hemp from the Chu valley are smuggled to 
neigboring and distant countries. 
  By using modern methods of checking luggage and cargo our 
Customs is trying to block illegal channels. It uses 40 
specially trained dogs for this and their number will soon be 
increased to 100 [words indistinct]. Foreign drug mafias have 
contributed to the seriousness of the situation which has 
developed in Kazakhstan. The relevant UN departments are 
worried about this. A group of its representatives, led by the 
deputy secretary general and the director of the UN program for 
control over drugs, Giorgio Giacomelli, who were on a visit to 
Almaty, urged the participants in the roundtable discussion to 
join efforts in combatting it. 
  Leaders of ministries of internal affairs and agriculture, 
the National Security Committee, procuracy and other departments 
put forward a number of proposals on this issue. In particular, 
they think it is important to set up a Kazakhstan committee for 
combatting drugs and drug smuggling.

  [Excerpt] Paris, June 3 (AFP) -- Kyrgyz President Askar 
Akayev said Friday he hoped the European Union would "finally 
turn to Kyrgyzstan" and help the former Soviet republic remain 
"the Central Asian Switzerland." 
  Akayev, who arrived in Paris Wednesday for a three-day 
official visit, used these terms to define the "island" of 
inter-ethnic peace and democracy in an "ocean of hurricanes" 
which is running the risk "of being submerged by a tidal wave 
without knowing where it will come from." 
  Speaking to an association of French and Russian 
journalists, 
he cited Moslem fundamentalism as one of the possible 
destabilising elements. He stressed such fundamentalism was not 
in the Kyrgyz tradition, but could "infiltrate from 
Afghanistan," via neighbouring Tajikistan which is being shaken 
by Islamic rebel attacks. 
  He also mentioned the narcotics business which, he warned, 
would turn his republic into the "Colombia of Central Asia" 
within a year or so if strong measures were not taken to stop it. 
  He recalled that Afghanistan is the world's second largest 
producer of opium behind Burma and that narcotics arrived in 
Paris or London via Tajikistan. He said he had asked the 
international community for help in "neutralising this 
distribution network." 
  Kyrgyzstan was once the Soviet Union's major producer of 
opium. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Quito, 9 Jun (EFE) -- It was reported today that the 
Quito criminal court has established that the Ecuadoran Armed 
Forces Bank had participated in the "laundering" of money coming 
from drug trafficking activities and confirmed the arrest of the 
bank's main officials. 
  The Quito Superior Court did not reveal the amount of money 
"laundered." It issued its conclusion prior to announcing the 
guilty verdict by two of its three members. Judge Janeth 
Calderon did not assign any responsibilities in this case. 
  The Ruminahui Bank manages the Ecuadoran Army, Navy, and Air 
Force resources. The verdict confirmed the arrest of Jose 
Racines, the former general manager of the military bank, and 
five other bank employees who were arrested in 1992 after the 
so-called "Magi Kings" group was dismantled. This is the only 
organization that, according to the police, has the 
characteristics of a drug cartel in Ecuador. 
  Racines and his subordinates, all of them civilians, were 
discharged from their posts by the military command after the 
Bank Superintendency [Superintendencia de Bancos] investigated 
the operations of the Ruminahui Bank, now in the process of 
being privatized. 
  Its new manager, General Gustavo Herrera, declared recently 
that bank operations had returned to their former standards. He 
added that up to last month, at least ten Ecuadoran and foreign 
banking institutions had expressed interest in purchasing 30 
percent of the bank's stock. In the coming days, the Ruminahui 
Bank will decide on the best offer. It will favor the financial 
group which guarantees a sound consortium that will provide the 
technology and capital "to compete with other private 
institutions in the country and abroad," Herrera said. 
  Defense Minister Gen. Jose Gallardo has asserted that he 
does 
not dismiss the possibility that the group selected will be 
foreign. However, he emphasized, this "has to be studied in 
detail due to the origin of the banking organization." 
  Eighty-one percent of the bank's shares--whose reserves 
amounted to $3.6 million through June 1993--belong to the Armed 
Forces and 19 percent to the remaining 2,500 minority 
shareholders.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 9 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan 
Treasury Police anti-drug trafficking operations during the 
first five months of 1994 netted 1,061 kg of cocaine worth $18.5 
million and 50 people arrested. 
  Police spokesman Faustino Sanchez told ACAN-EFE that 
Guatemala is a "bridge and storehouse" for international drug 
trafficking, adding that most cocaine shipments arrive by air 
from Colombia and Panama. Sanchez said drugs are "unloaded" at 
night and stored in clandestine warehouses ready to be shipped 
to Mexico and the United States, their final destination. 
  One of the most recent important seizures took place on 7 
June in Malacatan, in the northwestern San Marcos Department, 
bordering Mexico. Sanchez said two Guatemalans were arrested 
with 79 kg of cocaine worth $1.3 million, which they tried to 
smuggle into Mexican territory. The alleged "drug traffickers," 
who were travelling in a microbus, were identified as Walter 
Heberto Torres Recinos and Oscar Antonio Segura Chacon.

  [Text] Guadalajara, 11 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The explosion of a 
car bomb today at a Guadalajara hotel was, apparently, the work 
of individuals involved in drug trafficking, according to the 
preliminary reports released today by Jalisco State authorities. 
  A car bomb exploded at dawn on Saturday in the capital of 
Jalisco in western Mexico, causing two deaths and injuring five 
people, according to the Office of the State District Attorney 
(PGJE). 
  In a communique, the PGJE explained that the explosion took 
place during a birthday party at the hotel, which was attended 
by "families that may be related to the family of [well known 
drug trafficker Rafael] Caro Quintero." 
  Drug traffickers Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca 
alias "Don Neto" are serving prison sentences for their 
involvement in the 1985 murder of U.S. DEA agent Enrique 
Camarena. 
  According to a document released by the Jalisco authorities, 
at the tables cards were found with the names of the following 
families: the Quintero Echeverria Family, the Perez Quintero 
Family, and the Hernandez Quintero Family. 
  The PGJE said "the 15th Military Zone, Attorney General's 
Office (PGR) and PGJE are conducting a joint investigation." 
  Based on the testimony of a witness, the authorities 
established the sequence of events prior to the explosion. 
  According to Arturo Rangel Martinez (who was injured by the 
explosion), at 0200 local time (0800 GMT) he was in the bus 
owned by the music group "The Hurricanes of the North," for 
which he drives. 
  Rangel Martinez testified that he noticed "a parked Ford 
Grand Marquis, which was approached by a young man wearing a 
dark suit." 
  According to the PGJE communique, Rangel Martinez said that 
"approximately five minutes later, while he was resting inside 
the bus, he heard and felt an explosion and saw that the vehicle 
had exploded." 
  According to preliminary reports, the PGJE noted, it was 
possible to determine that "the vehicle that exploded had 
apparently been stolen and bore a superimposed license plate 
because, according to records, the plates belonged to another 
vehicle." 
  The explosion damaged the bus owned by the musicians who 
played at the party, and eight other vehicles. 
  The PGJE bulletin explained that the party, in honor of 
Karine Fernandez Castro who turned 15, was attended by 
approximately 200 guests, most of whom came from the northern 
Sinaloa State, one of the states that has the largest number of 
drug trafficking gangs. 
  The car bomb explosion follows the 7 June attempt by an 
armed 
group--which subsequently confronted policemen--to murder Leonel 
Quintero Payan, a relative of Caro Quintero, in Guadalajara. 
  There was also an incident on 10 June when drug agents 
prevented five armed individuals from kidnapping Leonel Quintero 
Payan, who had been wounded in the attack and was being treated 
at the Del Carmen hospital in this city. 
  "According to forensic investigations conducted so far on 
the 
bodies found at the site of the explosion, it is presumed that 
they are the bodies of two men" whose identities were not 
disclosed by the authorities. 
  The authorities have also disclosed that "of the five people 
hurt in the explosion, four of them suffered only slight 
injuries."

<F P=106> ["More Than 20 Arrested in Connection With Jalisco Bomb </F>
Attack" -- NOTIMEX headline] 
  [Text] Guadalajara, Mexico, 11 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The State 
Judicial Police [PJE] have reported that more than 20 people are 
under investigation in connection with the car-bomb explosion 
that occurred early Saturday morning in this Jalisco State 
capital. 
  The PJE reported that those arrested were in possession of 
weapons. Carmen Victoria Coronel, wife of Juan Jose Quintero 
Payan, was among those arrested. Quintero Paya apparently is a 
relative of drug-trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero. The police 
also reported that authorities seized a briefcase containing 
4,000 new pesos and $7,000 in cash, as well as an additional 
14,110 new pesos. 
  As part of the investigations, police raided the residence 
of 
Luis Enrique Fernandez Hurtado, who was not arrested, and seized 
seven AK-47's, known here as "goat horns"; an R-15 rifle; and a 
.45 caliber pistol. 
  It also has been reported that the people killed in the bomb 
blast have been identified as Marcial Gonzalez Muniz and 
Guillermo Gomez Chavez. Manuel Delgadillo Paez, director of the 
Investigations Department of the State Attorney General's 
Office, also reported that experts are working to determine what 
kind of explosives, and how much, were used in the bomb. 
  At 0200 (0800 GMT) Saturday, a Ford Grand Marquiz exploded 
in 
the parking lot of a Guadalajara Hotel where a birthday party 
was being held. Two people were killed and five others injured 
as a result of the explosion. The hotel management has filed a 
property-damage suit against whomever is found guilty of the 
attack. 
  The police also reported that their investigations have 
established that two stolen cars were parked in the parking lot 
in which the bomb exploded.

  [Excerpt] Mr. Ernesto Zedillo, Mexican presidential 
candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], 
speaking before the Mexican medical community, condemned the 
Guadalajara, Jalisco State car bomb attack. [begin recording] 
  Zedillo: Anonymous violence is one of the most 
brutal criminal actions--it attacks Mexican society's most 
appreciated values and must be strongly rejected. We demand 
that the circumstances regarding this crime be clarified and 
that those responsible receive harsh punishment. We Mexicans 
want to live safely, with tranquillity, and with unity. 
Criminal forces must not be allowed to disturb our country's 
social peace. [end recording] 
  The PRI candidate sent a message of solidarity to the people 
of Guadalajara: [begin recording] 
  Zedillo: Once again Guadalajara and all Jalisco 
residents suffer events that have absolutely nothing to do with 
these civic-minded and hard-working people. We join them in 
their demands for justice. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Raul Monge] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Enrique Alvarez Castillo was 
the first attorney general of the republic during the present 
government's six-year term. His appointment was a surprise, 
given the official's personal background. While he was governor 
of Jalisco, the drug traffic began to thrive in that state. The 
"narcos" were operating under the protection of Miguel Angel 
Felix Gallardo, who had total impunity. 
  As attorney general, Alvarez del Castillo admitted having 
had 
"the misfortune to learn, during my term as governor of Jalisco, 
that Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo was the brains of the group" 
formed by Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Carrillo. 
  However, he said nothing about the 14 arrest warrants 
against 
Felix Gallardo, three of which were issued while he was 
governor, without ever being implemented. 
  During the trial for the murder of the DEA [Drug Enforcement 
Administration] agent, Enrique Camarena Salazar, Javier Vazquez 
Velasco, an ex-judicial policeman and aide of Caro Quintero, 
claimed: "Alvarez del Castillo was involved in the drug traffic." 
  At the time, the official responded: "That is loose talk, 
attempting to implicate me." 
  During his brief stay (a year and a half) in the PGR, 
Alvarez 
del Castillo was accused of systematically violating human 
rights and tolerating corruption and impunity among PJF [Federal 
Judicial Police] agents. For that reason, he had serious 
confrontations with the National Commission for Human Rights 
[CNDH], especially in connection with the cases involving Norma 
Corona and Francisco Valencia Fontes. [passage omitted] 
  Ignacio Morales Lechuga arrived to replace him and, as soon 
as he took office, asserted that the PGR must be an agency 
promoting legality. He also promised to do an effective job in 
maintaining absolute respect for human rights and in forcefully 
combating impunity, "which is defeating our legal standards and 
has undermined the rule of law." 
  The now Mexican ambassador to France immediately revised 
plans and work programs, dismissing some 100 federal agents and 
remanding others implicated in human rights violations. The 
latter included Mario Alberto Gonzalez Trevino, accused of being 
the brains behind the death of Norma Corona. 
  Nevertheless, the cleanup did not include police chiefs who 
later were accused of illicit acquisition of wealth and of 
giving protection to drug traffickers. They included Guillermo 
Gonzalez Calderoni (a fugitive from justice), Fulvio Jimenez 
Turengano, and Adolfo Mondragon Aguirre. 
  Despite Morales Lechuga's intentions of making the PGR an 
institution promoting legality, it was soon realized that his 
words were having no repercussions on his subordinates. 
  Human rights violations prevailed, although to a lesser 
extent. The first Morales Lechuga-Carpizo confrontation occurred 
over the case relating to political columnist Victor Manuel 
Oropeza, murdered in Ciudad Juarez. The CNDH accused the PGR of 
having fabricated the charges against those blamed. The CNDH 
opinion in the Tlalixcoyan case (a confrontation between the 
military and the Federal Judicial Police involving a drug 
trafficking matter) was another severe blow to Morales Lechuga. 
  After this incident, which occurred on 6 November 1992, his 
right-hand man, Federico Ponce Rojas, was dismissed, just as 
Javier Coello Trejo had been in Alvarez del Castillo's time. 
  Morales Lechuga became embroiled in more problems when the 
PGR exonerated Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, after the Los 
Angeles court suspended the trial being held against him as a 
presumed participant in the death of DEA agent Camarena Salazar. 
On 27 April 1990, Alvarez del Castillo had claimed that the PGR 
had more than sufficient evidence to take action against the 
Jalisco physician. 
  At the end of 1992, the battle among various drug 
trafficking 
groups intensified, causing a heightening of the violence in the 
northern part of the country. The shooting confrontation 
occurred at the Christine discotheque in Puerto Vallarta, 
persons close to Caro Quintero were killed in Iguala, and bombs 
exploded in Culiacan. It was later learned that in all these 
cases the PJF had given protection to drug trafficking rings. 
  Displeased by this situation, Salinas de Gortari decided to 
oust Morales Lechuga. To replace him, he named Jorge Carpizo, 
the present secretary of government, then head of the CNDH. 
Direct, and without misgivings, the ex-rector of the UNAM 
[National Autonomous University of Mexico] and minister on leave 
from the National Supreme Court criticized the performance of 
his predecessors. He declared: "It is impossible for agents of 
the law and of society to violate legal standards in combating 
crime." 
  He maintained that this battle must be waged based on the 
legal system and human rights: "Mexico demands a better 
prosecution of justice and better public safety. Crime, 
especially that associated with the drug traffic, must be fought 
with complete firmness and total determination." 
  Carpizo's first victims were the PGR agents linked with the 
drug traffic and engaged in acts contrary to the law. Over 100 
policemen were dismissed, removed, or subjected to penal remand. 
  Rodolfo Leon Aragon, chief of the PJF, was one of the first 
to leave the PGR. The departure of the police commander who had 
survived the first two shakeups in the PGR enabled Carpizo to 
create the National Institute To Combat Drugs, with Jorge Tello 
Peon as director. Upon Carpizo's arrival in the Government 
Secretariat, Tello Peon was transferred to the National Center 
for Investigation and Security. 
  Then Carpizo, contrary to his principles of acting with the 
law as his criterion, directed a campaign against journalists 
presumably implicated in the drug traffic. Congressman Cesareo 
Morales, Mario Munguia, Mario Rivas, and Heriberto Deandar 
Martinez, among many others, were accused. In all four cases, 
the judges rejected the evidence submitted by the PGR. 
  The weakness in remands submitted by the PGR during the 
Carpizo era also enabled gunmen and small-scale drug dealers to 
obtain their release. For example, there was the case of Ramon 
Alcides Magana and Adan Segundo Canales, gunmen for the "capo," 
Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Both were later arrested and remanded in 
connection with the incidents that occurred on 24 November 1993 
at the Ochoa Bali-Hai restaurant. 
  After this, Carpizo charged that members of the Federal 
Judicial Branch were acting suspiciously when they were required 
to issue their court decisions. [passage omitted] 
  Dedicated to capturing drug traffickers, Carpizo disregarded 
the criminals engaged in kidnapping, which has increased 
considerably in the country. 
  Salinas de Gortari removed Carpizo from the PGR, sending him 
to the Government Secretariat. Diego Valades, who was in the 
capital's attorney general's office, became head of that 
department, in the fourth shakeup of officials in five years. 
  Like his predecessors, Valades promised to guarantee the 
population's public safety. The recent incidents occurring in 
Tijuana and Mexico City, where crime has risen five percent over 
last year's level, according to official data, prove that there 
has been little progress in that area.

  [Excerpts] Victoria, Tamaulipas, 14 May--Today, Benjamin 
Lopez Aquirre, the federal congressman representing Matamoros, 
maintained that there are still "narcos" working as policemen on 
the border, especially in the State Judicial and municipal 
forces. He claimed that they are helping to transport drug 
shipments from that area. 
  He emphasized that drug traffickers who have infiltrated 
this 
border state's police forces are collaborating in the "business." 
  As he explained, this problem persists, despite the efforts 
made by the offices of the national and state attorneys general 
to combat it. 
  He indicated that this state office should conduct a 
thorough 
investigation of the lifestyle of every agent, noting that its 
attention should be focused on commanders and ex-police chiefs 
who have amassed huge fortunes. [passage omitted] 
  He declared: "There are many policemen in these 
circumstances 
in Matamoros, but the same thing applies to Reynosa and Nuevo 
Laredo." 
  Adding that programs such as testing for drugs have been 
useful, he remarked, however, that they only help to detect the 
members addicted to cocaine or marijuana who have been receiving 
drugs from the "narcos," so as to keep those individuals in the 
latter's service. 
  As for the assertion made by the state attorney general, 
Raul 
Morales Cadena, to the effect that Matamoros "is free from 
`narcos'" because Juan Garcia Abrego has moved his center of 
operations to Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, the legislator commented: 
"Not to my knowledge." 
  Nevertheless, he admitted that the violence generated by the 
drug traffic "has declined in recent months." 
  He concluded by saying that, for a long time, Matamoros has 
not experienced confrontations between rival "narco" rings in 
broad daylight, in central sections of the town. These 
confrontations had been causing panic among the population in 
the past.

  [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 18 May--The drug 
trafficker Roberto Villalba Luna, who had infiltrated the ranks 
of the local government's Directorate of Public Safety and 
Roadways, was arrested last night with three members of his 
gang. They were attempting to load a ton of marijuana into a 
vehicle for shipment to the United States. This announcement was 
made by the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] deputy commissioner in 
the state, Javier Norona Guerrero, who added that the commercial 
value of the drugs exceeded $4 million. 
  The source noted that the 35-year-old subject, in uniform, 
with three other drug dealers, was intercepted at 630 Bolivia 
Street in the Colonia El Barreal, after having removed the drugs 
from the vicinity of that residence, and attempting to put them 
into a van. 
  The capture culminated a long investigation begun three 
weeks 
ago, when the large-scale movement of drugs in the town began to 
arouse suspicion. 
  The action by the Attorney General's Office [PGR] was 
coordinated by the force's first commander. The nearby streets 
were surrounded and a counternarcotics security operation was 
mounted, in which the subject's accomplices, Jesus Dorantes, 
aged 21; Patricio Esparza, 34; and Gerardo Calderon, 36, were 
also captured, according to the official. 
  He added that the first investigations conducted by the PGR 
had indicated that the police agent, Roberto Villalba Luna, with 
four years of service in the department, was moving large 
volumes of various drugs to the United States, using his 
position as protection. 
  Norona reiterated: "His main function was to guard the drugs 
as far as the Mexican border, and he would be shielded by his 
uniform." 
  He explained that the operation, which began at 2000 today, 
will continue, according to a report from the PJF offices, with 
more arrests made as the investigations are pursued. 
  The official added that those arrested, as well as the 
drugs, 
were placed at the disposal of the Federal Public Prosecutor's 
Office.

<F P=106> [Interview with Baja California Governor Ernesto Ruffo Appel </F>
by Felipe Cobian and Antonio Jaquez, in Mexicali; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Ruffo admits that the drug 
trafficking problem is "very serious," noting that the greatest 
obstacle to surmounting it is the collusion between criminal 
organizations and the state and federal judicial system. This is 
compounded by the lack of cooperation among the three levels of 
government. 
  In the interview with PROCESO, Ruffo also expresses his 
doubts regarding the Colosio case, and his concern over the 
murder of the Tijuana municipal police chief, Jose Federico 
Benitez Lopez, as well as the arrest of Sergio Ortiz Lara, the 
state's deputy attorney general. 
  As for the drug trafficking problem, the governor claims: 
"It 
is a very serious problem. It is dreadful from the standpoint 
that the criminals' interests should be implicated in police 
organizations. Where the drug traffic is concerned, enormous 
sums of money are being transacted. It has been proven on many 
occasions (because there have been remands, many of them made by 
Dr. Carpizo) that officials or members of the attorney generals' 
offices were implicated. I believe this to be the main reason 
that it has been impossible to put an end to the drug traffic: 
because this collusion has existed." 
  He adds that, in Baja California, there have been situations 
wherein doubts existed regarding various officials, as in the 
specific case of Deputy Attorney General Ortiz Lara. [passage 
omitted] 
  "After so much comment and speculation, I decided to replace 
the attorney general (Juan Francisco Franco, who has been cited 
as a protector of `narcos'). I said to myself, there is no need 
for me to put up with doubts, when there has been no complicity 
by my government or, specifically, by me personally. I place no 
limit on clearing up any doubts concerning my organization; that 
is my intention. I wish this also held true in the case of the 
federal organization." [passage omitted] 
  He proposes the formation of joint police forces, consisting 
of municipal, state, and federal agents, under a common command 
("in this case it might be federal, but it does not matter"), 
with two subcommands, one municipal and another state, that 
would report to the governor and the mayor. "In this way, all of 
us would know what was going on everywhere." 
  PROCESO: The current lack of cooperation 
ultimately benefits the criminal organizations, doesn't it? 
  Ruffo: Yes, because they are organized with just 
one purpose; in that sense, they are united. We have three 
levels, and there are some huge gaps between one level and 
another. [passage omitted] 
  PROCESO: The PGR [Attorney General's Office] has 
accused state officials and agents of being involved in the drug 
traffic. What information do you have about federal personnel in 
the same situation? 
  Ruffo: I have received much information to that 
effect. The fact is that, for judicial reasons, such information 
does not constitute evidence. But we all know the story; you 
reporters know it. However, the problem is to prove it in court. 
And we have no testimony, because those who would give it die. 
  PROCESO: The finance minister, Pedro Aspe, 
commented in Washington recently that the drug traffic has 
permeated all levels of the Mexican security forces. He claimed 
that, in Tijuana, "the judicial system is so corrupt that, every 
time a drug trafficker is arrested there, an attempt is made to 
remand for federal crimes, so as to take the subject to Mexico 
City, because all the judges in Tijuana have been bought." Is 
that the way it is? 
  Ruffo: What I am saying isn't much different from 
Aspe's statement. So, I am particularly concerned, because a 
town in my state is involved, but.... 
  PROCESO: Is Aspe correct? 
  Ruffo: He is correct to a great extent. And I feel 
helpless with this responsibility, because organized crime is 
one thing, and natural crime is something else. It is up to me 
to investigate the latter, because it belongs to the common 
jurisdiction; whereas the former comes under the federal 
jurisdiction. But, if there is no cooperation, it is like 
climbing stairs with one foot: you go along balanced on one 
side, and cannot even move, because you will fall. That is why I 
harbor very great expectations (based on reason, however, 
because I have often had futile enthusiasm) for the Public 
Security Coordinating Board that President Salinas has just 
announced, headed by Farell. I have heard negative comments 
about Farell, but you must admit that he is a precise, tough, 
thorough fellow. And this is not a matter of political parties; 
it is a national public security issue. So, I hope that the 
bases underlying that cooperation can solve some of what I have 
described. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Tijuana, Baja California, 10 May--The Attorney 
General's Office [PGR] requested 30 warrants for the arrest and 
appearance of ex-officials and ex-agents of the State Attorney's 
Office, and has already implemented some of them. They are 
associated with the cases of the shootout at the Christine 
discotheque in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, the confrontation here 
on 3 March between federal agents and "narcos," and the presumed 
link between State Judicial Police [PJE] members and the drug 
Mafia. 
  Today, the ex-state attorney, Juan Francisco Franco Rios, 
appeared at the PGR headquarters to make his statement. He was 
interrogated for 15 hours regarding the matter of the 
credentials carried by bodyguards of the Arellano Felix family 
drug traffickers at the Christine discotheque. 
  Franco Rios and Alvarez Barriere denied that there was a 
"massive flight" of ex-PJE members, claiming that all the group 
chiefs replaced yesterday still remain in town. 
  Furthermore, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office took 
penal action against the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agent, 
Gabriel Anzures Carpeta, as a person presumed guilty of crimes 
against the administration of justice and of theft, during his 
participation in the arrest of the Baja California deputy 
attorney general, Sergio Ortiz Lara. 
  Meanwhile, 100 Federal Judicial Police agents arrived in 
Ciudad Juarez searching for the Tamaulipas drug trafficking 
"capo," Juan Garcia Abrego, and the brothers Benjamin, Ramon, 
and Francisco Javier Arellano Felix, Sinaloan drug dealers 
involved in the death of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. 
This announcement was made by the force's general director, 
Adrian Carrera Fuentes. 
<H5>  Thirty Arrest Warrants </H5>
  After making his statement during a 12-hour period, the 
ex-commander of the PJE's second sector in this town, Jorge 
Alvarez Barriere, who admitted having been queried about the 
incidents of 3 March, remarked that the PGR had issued 30 
warrants for arrest and appearance. 
  He confirmed the existence of case record 3455, in 
connection 
with which the federal department opened an investigation of 
state agents' participation in the drug traffic. 
  During his appearance before the PGR, Alvarez Barriere also 
explained that, at the time of the confrontation in Puerto 
Vallarta, he was not yet an agent of the force in Tijuana, and 
hence had no connection with the incident. 
  He also denied having been dismissed from his position, 
claiming that the one currently heading the force has merely 
made a substitution. [passage omitted] 
  As for the case involving the state's ex-attorney general, 
Juan Francisco Franco Rios, his defense attorney, Juan Belmonte 
Stringel, explained that he had been interrogated for a period 
of 15 hours regarding the credentials being carried by 
bodyguards of the drug trafficker, Arellano Felix, during the 
incidents that occurred at the Christine discotheque in Puerto 
Vallarta, Jalisco. 
  He added that his client, who remained at the department's 
facilities from 1800 yesterday until 0800 today, had submitted 
evidence showing that the identity documents in the drug 
traffickers' possession were false, and that his signature had 
been altered. 
  After the questioning, Belmonte Stringel declared that the 
ex-official, who appeared with an amparo to make statements at 
the PGR facilities, is by no means linked with the drug traffic 
or the shooting that occurred on 3 March in this town. [passage 
omitted] 
  Moreover, in a communique, the PGR stated that, based on the 
activities cited in preliminary investigation 1142/94, the 
Federal Public Prosecutor's Office found Gabriel Anzures 
Carpeta, a PJF member, presumably guilty of crimes against the 
administration of justice and theft. 
  It should be recalled that, when the deputy attorney 
general, 
Sergio Ortiz Lara, was arrested, he was put into a green 1993 
Jeep Cherokee without license plates, which had been reported as 
stolen, and driven by the presumed criminal. 
  The vehicle was detected after the U.S. consul in Tijuana, 
Edwin Cubbisson, gave the department a list of 25 vehicles 
stolen in California, including that one, as well as another of 
the same type, a 1989 model. 
  The PGR spokesman, Jesus Velasco, announced that, to date, 
five persons have made statements in connection with that 
preliminary investigation, which was turned over to the sixth 
district judge of criminal proceedings in Baja California. 
  He stressed that the probes will continue, to determine 
whether there are other public officials involved in this 
illicit activity. 
<H5>  One Hundred PJF Forces in Juarez </H5>
  The PJF general director in Ciudad Juarez, Adrian Carrera 
Fuentes, announced that 100 agents from this corps arrived today 
on a search for the Tamaulipas drug trafficking "capo," Juan 
Garcia Abrego, and the brothers Benjamin, Ramon, and Francisco 
Javier Arellano Felix, Sinaloan drug traffickers implicated in 
the death of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. 
  The agents arrived on a special plane and on the "guajolota" 
[turkey], (a DC-6 used by the Attorney General's Office to 
transport prisoners classified as dangerous). They were headed 
by Carrera Fuentes and the operations coordinator, Jose Luis 
Patino, who were lodged in two hotels. 
  During the operation, initiated in Ciudad Juarez, residences 
in the Campestre Juarez, Country Racquet, and San Marcos 
subdivisions were searched, as well as some rooms in hotels and 
even on farms located in the Casas Grandes area of the state's 
northwestern section. 
  Carrera Fuentes explained that, based on the information 
held 
by the PGR, a simultaneous operation is being conducted in this 
town and Tijuana, "the worst trouble spots in the passage of 
drugs to the United States." 
  He noted that probes are being made, ranging from bank 
accounts to operations carried out by the Arellano Felix 
brothers on this border. 
  Carrera Fuentes claimed that the drug cartel chief in 
Tamaulipas, Juan Garcia Abrego, was on this border a few days 
ago. "We are following their trail closely, and expect to 
capture the Arellano Felix brothers at any moment." [passage

  [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 11 May--Agents from the 
Attorney General's Office (PGR) mounted an operation here today 
(from 1630 to 1930) at the exits of the international bridges 
crossing to the United States. Its purpose was to trap the 
members of the Arellano Felix family and its accomplices, 
according to the Federal Judicial Police (PJF) first commander 
in the state, Javier Norona Guerrero. 
  He added that the operation was conducted on the export 
lanes 
by 100 Federal Judicial agents who, besides seeking "escapees," 
were also looking for possible drug shipments on those bridges. 
  Norona Guerrero claimed that the instructions from the PJF 
director, Adrian Carrera Fuentes, who visited Nuevo Laredo and 
Matamoros, Tamaulipas, today, are to continue the search for the 
Arellano Felix brothers and Juan Garcia Abrego. The latter 
apparently was here a few days ago. 
  He noted that the thorough inspections of departing vehicles 
were made strategically. The sides of the lanes were blocked by 
a group of Judicial Police agents armed with "banana clip" 
weapons, while others requested identifications and searched 
automobile trunks. 
  Although Carrera Fuentes left this town today, a PGR group 
led by Commander Jose Luis Patino is reinforcing the search for 
Garcia Abrego and the Arellano Felix group in the Casas Grandes 
region. 
  As for a possible "tipoff" to the fugitives, Norona Guerrero 
explained that there was none, because the measure is part of 
the permanent campaign to find the aforementioned drug 
traffickers. 
  Before leaving Ciudad Juarez, Adrian Carrera announced that 
a 
security corridor had been formed from Tijuana to Matamoros, to 
prevent the Arellano Felix group and Garcia Abrego from leaving 
Mexico.

  [Excerpts] Avoiding the promotion of attitudes leading to 
confusion in the society, refraining from disinformation and 
rumor, and adhering strictly to the law, with full respect for 
the separation of powers: these policies were proclaimed 
yesterday by President Salinas de Gortari and Baja California 
Governor Ernesto Ruffo Appel, during a long conversation held at 
Los Pinos. 
  Salinas de Gortari and Ruffo Appel, with the mayor of 
Tijuana, Hector Osuna Jaime, agreed in citing the undeferrable 
need to pool efforts throughout the republic. They made a series 
of commitments aimed at coordinating efforts to deal with the 
common enemy of Mexico and Baja California: the drug traffic. 
  The Baja California governor, who recently expressed his 
disapproval of the manner in which that state's deputy attorney 
general, Sergio Ortiz Lara, was arrested by Federal Judicial 
Police personnel, arrived at Los Pinos shortly after noon. 
[passage omitted] 
  The heads of the three government echelons--federal, state, 
and municipal--agreed, with respect to public security, on the 
creation of interdisciplinary police units, with federal, state, 
and municipal forces. Their main objective will be to combat 
activities and crimes associated with drug trafficking. 
  It was explained that these units will engage in preventive 
and surveillance activity, through close cooperation in their 
operations. These police units will have agents from the Federal 
and State Public Prosecutors' Offices present to assist them. 
The latter will submit joint reports to the authorities on the 
three government levels, under the political responsibility of 
the federal chief executive, the state governor, and the mayor 
of Tijuana, in their respective jurisdictions. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 16 May--The Attorney 
General's Office (PGR) will put up for sale all the properties 
seized here from the Arellano Felix brothers and "Chapo Guzman," 
through public auctions to be held for two weeks starting this 
Tuesday. This announcement was made today by the spokesman for 
the department's local office, Jesus Velasco. 
  He remarked that, according to a report from the General 
Directorate for Control of Confiscated Goods, the seized assets 
range from real properties to luxury cars, and household items. 
  He gave a reminder that they were seized from the drug 
traffickers Arellano Felix and "Chapo Guzman" after the murder 
of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. 
  He noted that, during the first auction, held on 3 May, only 
one house was sold; hence, this Tuesday, both individuals and 
corporate bodies may take part in the sale of these properties, 
located in various parts of Tijuana. 
  He specified that the residences for sale this Tuesday, 17 
May, are located in the Monte Bello subdivision, Colonia 
Reforma, La Gloria, La Mesa, Playas de Tijuana, and Lomas de 
Aguacaliente. 
  He explained that persons interested in purchasing any of 
the 
properties should submit a single bid in a sealed envelope, 
accompanied by a 10 percent downpayment, to the PGR's account. 
  The first call for bids includes the furnishings of 110 
houses, such as furniture in general and office equipment, 
linens, and both electronic and decorative articles, he remarked. 
  Finally, he announced that, next week the date, time, and 
place for the auction of 30 confiscated vehicles would be 
posted. Prominent among them are a pickup truck, a van, dump 
trucks, two Mercedes-Benz cars, and a Ford LTD convertible.

  [Excerpt] Over eight tons of packed marijuana, distributed 
in a railroad car, a tank truck, buckets, drums, and nine 
vehicles equipped with special compartments, were seized 
yesterday by Federal Judicial Police [PJF] personnel detailed to 
Sinaloa, Veracruz, Oaxaca, San Luis Potosi, Coahuila, and 
Tamaulipas States, where 15 presumed public poisoners were 
arrested. It is estimated that the drugs, intended to be sent to 
the United States for sale and consumption, were worth 
approximately 150 million new pesos. 
  According to a report submitted to the assistant attorney 
for 
local offices and inspection, Alfonso Cabrera Morales, prominent 
among the seizures made by the federal agents is the one that 
occurred at the railroad terminal in the port of Mazatlan, 
Sinaloa. There, three tons of pressed marijuana were confiscated. 
  It was noted that the PGR [Attorney General's Office] 
representatives, in cooperation with the officials at that 
station, made a routine inspection on the train that runs from 
the city of Guadalajara, Jalisco, to Mexicali, Baja California 
(with a stop in Mazatlan). Upon discovering that the seals of 
the freight car on which the drugs were being carried had been 
tampered with, the police agents intensified the search. They 
found the three tons of cannabis, bound for Baja California, 
contained in hundreds of packages. 
  At the order of the PGR representative in that state, Luis 
Antonio Ibanez Cornejo, PJF deputy commissioner Eduardo Salazar 
Carillo continued the investigation at the aforementioned 
railroad terminal. The local PGR offices in Jalisco and Baja 
California were also advised to continue the probe, capture the 
drug owners, determine whether any National Railroads employee 
was implicated in the incident, and take the appropriate action. 
  Furthermore, as was reported to the PJF's general director, 
Adrian Carrera Fuentes, Jose Braulio Salvador Campos Beltran, 
Salvador Campos Beltran, Juan Manuel Espino Trejo, Juan Sergio 
Espino Chan, and Jose Salvador Francisco Campos Beltran were 
arrested in the municipality of Acayucan, Veracruz. They were 
carrying approximately two tons of cannabis indica on a tank 
truck, also bound for the country's northern border. 
  It was explained that the drugs in question had been packed 
in 280 plastic buckets which, in turn, were distributed in the 
tank of the vehicle. The latter is presumed to be owned by the 
Felem Company, which is being investigated by agents under 
orders from Deputy Commissioner Fernando Asiain Barriga.

  [Excerpts] Cocaine base, packed marijuana, opium gum, 
"crystal," ephedrine, and both poppy and cannabis indica seed, 
worth approximately 150 million new pesos and intended to be 
shipped to the United States for sale and consumption, were 
incinerated yesterday by the Attorney General's Office [PGR] in 
Jalisco State. There, legal action is being taken against at 
least 20 presumed public poisoners associated with the 
confiscations. [passage omitted] 
  The PGR's representative in Jalisco, Raul Garza Serna, 
reported to the assistant attorney for local offices and 
inspection, Alfonso Cabrera Morales, that the drugs were burned 
on the premises of the Jalisco Hunting Club located in the 
settlement of La Venta del Astillero, near the city of 
Guadalajara. They consisted of approximately six tons of pressed 
marijuana, nearly 37 kg of cocaine base, and 274 kg of 
ephedrine, a chemical precursor used by drug traffickers to 
prepare amphetamines and to process cocaine base. Also destroyed 
in the presence of military authorities and representatives from 
the health sector and the Public Education Secretariat, on both 
the state and municipal level, were 20 kg of the drug known as 
"crystal," 92 kg of methylamphetamine, eight kg and 263 grams of 
opium gum, some 17,000 psychotropic pills, and nearly two kg of 
marijuana and poppy seed. Various plants used as samples from 
crops that had been discovered and eradicated in the state were 
destroyed as well. 
  The public servant explained that the incinerated drugs, 
which would have netted the public poisoners sizable profits, 
were connected with seizures made during February by Federal 
Judicial Police agents, still under the command of the force's 
deputy commissioner, Javier Gomez Lopez. 
  At this event, Garza Serna stressed that the cooperation of 
all social sectors of the population is essential in the battle 
against the drug traffic. He indicated that family intervention 
plays a preponderant role in preventing future generations from 
succumbing to drug use and abuse. The authorities present at the 
incineration ceremony, for their part, confirmed their 
commitment to support each and every action against the 
aforementioned social cancer taken by the PGR, now under the 
command of Humberto Benitez Trevino. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Torreon, Coahuila, 16 May--Commander Juan Carlos 
Alvarado announced today that Federal Judicial Police [PJF] 
forces succeeded in confiscating 253 packages of various shapes 
and sizes containing a total of 1,063 kg and 920 grams of 
marijuana. 
  The incident occurred at 1330 near Puerto Pinones, along the 
Zacatecas-Saltillo highway, while the drugs were being carried 
on a 1987 red Torton type truck with Federal District license 
plates. 
  The grass was concealed in a false compartment made of wood 
on the sides of the trailer, in the vehicle driven by Juan 
Manuel Barrera Reyes. He would admit only that he had left Agua 
Caliente, Zacatecas, bound for this capital. However, he claimed 
not to know the name of the shipment's owner nor that of the 
person for whom it was intended. 
  The police chief remarked that when the driver, Barrera 
Reyes, noticed the PJF agents' presence, he seemed very nervous, 
and accelerated the vehicle. It was stopped for inspection, with 
the aforementioned results. The incident was reported to the MP 
[Public Prosecutor's Office] agent, Roberto Lujan Sanchez, so 
that he might remand the subject to the district court in La 
Laguna.

  [Excerpts] Redoubling the battle against organized crime, 
the Attorney General's Office [PGR] seized three tons and 148 kg 
of dried, packed marijuana at a Sonora highway checkpoint, in an 
operation in which two presumed drug dealers were arrested. 
[passage omitted] 
  The confiscation was made yesterday at the highway 
checkpoint 
located in the Hermosillo-Benjamin Hill section, according to 
Angel Cortes Ibarra, the PGR's state representative. He added 
that Jose Luis Prado Anguiano and Oscar Armando Henriquez were 
arrested in this operation. They were transporting the drugs in 
a shipment of avocados carried on a Federal Public Service 
tractor-trailer truck. 
  The official remarked that the carrier was stopped precisely 
at that checkpoint, located at km 120 of the aforementioned 
highway. Noticing the nervousness of its driver, the agents 
started inspecting the refrigerated "body" being hauled by the 
Famsa tractor-trailer with plates 118-BA9. They found 140 
packages of cannabis completely hidden among the avocados and 
other fruit. 
  The presumed drug traffickers told the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office that they had brought the load from Uruapan, 
Michoacan, and that its destination was the town of Tijuana. 
They were supposed to transport the drugs from there to the 
United States. 
  The Federal Judicial Police are continuing the investigation 
to locate the marijuana owners who make up this drug trafficking 
ring, with involvement in Michoacan and Baja California. 
  It was declared that the battle against the drug traffic and 
organized crime will continue without respite throughout the 
entire country. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Nearly 3 million doses of drugs (171 kg of cocaine, 
12 kg of "crystal," 66 kg of ephedrine, and 62 kg of marijuana), 
estimated as worth $18 million, were seized by agents of the 
Attorney General's Office [PGR] yesterday. 
  The counternarcotics operations carried out by the Federal 
Judicial Police in cooperation with the National Institute To 
Combat Drugs, in Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Baja California States, 
made it possible to capture four presumed drug dealers. Also 
confiscated were three vehicles equipped to transport the drugs. 
  In making the preceding announcement, Alfonso Cabrera 
Morales, the PGR's assistant attorney for local offices and 
inspections, claimed that, during the current administration, as 
of yesterday, approximately 7.5 tons of cocaine have been seized. 
  Alberto Jardi Alonso, the institution's representative in 
Chihuahua, for his part, reported the largest confiscation. Joel 
Delgado Bustamante was captured with 171 kg and 800 grams of the 
alkaloid and 62 kg and 30 grams of marijuana in his possession. 
The cocaine alone would have allowed nearly 2.5 million doses to 
go into circulation. 
  The capture took place near the settlement of San Isidro, 
located on the Ciudad Juarez-El Porvenir highway. The subject 
was driving a brown Grand Marquis vehicle with state of Texas 
license plates GJZ-65K. 
  The federal agents requested a search of the vehicle, 
because 
it appeared to be carrying a heavy load in the trunk. It was 
here the drug dealer was transporting his shipment. 
  As for the "crystal," it was seized upon the arrest of 
Francisco Nava Duarte, who was intercepted at a highway 
checkpoint established near the settlement of El Desengano, in 
the Sinaloa municipality of Ahome, where his vehicle was 
inspected. 
  The latter was a blue 1988 Nissan minivan with state of 
California plates 20KL853. It was carrying in its fuel tank the 
12 kg and 700 grams of the drug, which would have been used to 
produce 250,000 doses. 
  The subjects presumed guilty were left at the disposal of 
the 
agent of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, together with 
the confiscated drugs. The pertinent preliminary investigations 
are being opened, while the Federal Judicial Police continue the 
search to locate and arrest the other accomplices in this 
illicit activity.

  [Text] Mexico City, 6 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- A light plane from 
Colombia, which was loaded with 800 kg of cocaine, was captured 
in Chetumal, southeastern Mexico, the Attorney General's Office 
[PGR] has reported. 
  The PGR reported the death of three members of the Federal 
Judicial Police [PJF] and the pilot of a helicopter, which was 
used to pursue the individuals who were awaiting the light 
plane's arrival. A PGR communique added that the PJF and the 
National Counternarcotics Institute (Incd) captured the aircraft 
in Chetumal, capital of the southeastern State of Quintana Roo. 
The document pointed out that Incd radars detected the Turbo 
Commander with registration no. N520QS from Colombia before it 
entered Mexican airspace. 
  The PGR carried out an operation involving helicopters and 
planes that led to the capture of the aircraft and three 
vehicles that were going to transport the drug to its 
destination.

  [Excerpts] The "capo" of the drug traffic in Mexico, Miguel 
Angel Felix Gallardo, was found guilty of the murders of DEA 
[Drug Enforcement Administration] agent Enrique Camarena Salazar 
and the Mexican pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, of crimes against 
health in the form of cocaine trafficking, and of illegal 
deprivation of freedom. He was sentenced to the maximum term of 
40 years in prison by the fourth district judge of criminal 
proceedings of the National Supreme Court, assigned to 
Guadalajara, Jalisco. 
  In his decision, the administrator of justice in the federal 
jurisdiction found Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo to have acted 
with the aggravating circumstances of premeditation and 
advantage in the kidnapping and murder of the DEA agent, 
Camarena Salazar, and the Mexican aviator-pilot, Alfredo Zavala 
Avelar. 
  At the conclusion of the criminal proceedings lasting nine 
years, the federal judge also found the implicated subject, 
considered the "czar of cocaine in Mexico" and the "drug traffic 
`capo' in Mexico" before his arrest in April 1989, guilty of 
crimes against health. The latter were in the forms of 
clandestine entry, illegal export, collection, purchase and 
sale, and storage of large amounts of cocaine. Hence, he decided 
to impose the maximum penalty stipulated in the Federal Code of 
Criminal Procedures at the time that the federal social 
representative brought penal action against him. 
  Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo was informed of the sentence 
associated with proceedings 82/85 inside the Federal Maximum 
Security Center where he has been confined since 1992. He was 
transferred there from the Southern Crime Prevention Prison, 
where he had been held since 1989, following his arrest at a 
residence in the Chapalita subdivision of Guadalajara, Jalisco. 
  The notification procedure was carried out based on letters 
requisitorial from the Jalisco federal judge sent to his 
counterpart in Mexico State, so that the hearing might be 
established and held in the federal maximum security prison. 
[passage omitted] 
  If the sentence should be appealed, the trial against the 
implicated subject will be continued in the pertinent court with 
several judges, and the magistrates who are members of that body 
will be the ones to issue the pertinent decision, with which 
both parties may also express dissent.

  [Text] The Government of Panama has protested to the U.S. 
Embassy because DEA agents held a meeting--without prior 
Panamanian authorization--at the border area of Puerto Obaldia 
with Colombian and Panamanian police officers to gather 
information on subversion and narcotics trafficking. 
  A Foreign Ministry document that contains a protest note 
from 
the Panamanian Government to the U.S. Government says that the 
meeting was held in the area of Puerto Obaldia, San Blas Indian 
territory. The note points out that the meeting was held on 15 
and 16 November 1992 when DEA agents Luis Mercado and Isaac 
Gallegos went to Puerto Obaldia and met with Colombian and 
Panamanian police officers. 
  During this meeting, which was not authorized by Panama, the 
DEA agents covered subjects such as narcotics trafficking, 
subversion, communications, weapons, police coordination between 
Panama and Colombia, and public health problems. According to 
the note, agents Mercado and Gallegos also visited several 
government offices in Puerto Obaldia, without receiving 
authorization from Panamanian officials or from the officials 
responsible for the various areas. 
  The Panamanian Foreign Ministry note advises the United 
States that all meetings of U.S. officials in Panama must be 
authorized first by Panamanian officials. The note adds that 
such actions could lead to an incident, inasmuch as the national 
authorities have orders not to allow foreign officials from 
holding meetings in national territory or gathering information 
without the prior authorization of the officials in charge.

drugs and illegal drug trafficking are matters that concern both 
the United States and Panama. He added that it is a priority to 
hold a high-level meeting to coordinate joint actions. [Begin

  Mulino: If the U.S. Government confirms it, we 
will hold a meeting at the highest level in Panama during the 
first week of July. I will preside over this meeting, and it is 
to be attended by very important U.S. State and Justice 
Department, perhaps even U.S. Treasury, officials to discuss all 
the drug trafficking and money laundering problems. 
  As you will recall, on 13 April I sent a letter to U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher telling him that, instead 
of talking and arguing whether we have cooperated or not, I 
invited him to a high-level meeting in Panama to discuss this 
topic. The invitation has been accepted and, hopefully, will be 
held during the first week of July. [end recording]

  [Text] Major Santiago Fundora, National Air Service (SAN) 
director, pointed out yesterday that drug traffickers are 
looking for new routes to conduct their drug activity in the 
national territory. He also confirmed the existence of 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] guerrillas in the 
border region with Darien. 
  Fundora indicated that, given the pressures the National 
Police are exerting on international drug traffickers, the 
traffickers are looking for new areas to bring drugs into the 
nation, thereby continuing the trafficking process. Fundora 
said this is the reason authorities often refuse to disclose 
information on operations to eradicate and to prevent drug 
trafficking activities. 
  According to the SAN director, the traffickers work around 
the clock and they relocate very easily to other sites to 
continue their trafficking. Fundora made these statements 
during a meeting with directors of various state security 
organizations. The objective of the meeting was to discuss new 
strategies to fight drug trafficking, money laundering, and 
crime. 
  Fundora confirmed the presence of FARC guerrillas in the 
Darien territory, and he stressed that more vigilance in this 
zone is needed because of the FARC presence. Fundora added that 
the National Government must increase the number of Border 
Police units and it must supply them with better equipment to 
conduct their work. 
  The government must make efforts to combat piracy on the 
seas, drug trafficking activities, and crime in the capital, 
Fundora noted. He added that the ghost of militarism should 
disappear and that members of the National Police should be 
properly equipped to perform their duties more effectively. 
  Fundora also suggested more drastic measures to combat crime 
and international drug trafficking, such as 30-year sentences. 
He also suggested that guards whose participation is proven in 
the escape of drug traffickers should be forced to pay for the 
pending sentence. If this were implemented, the system would 
change, he noted. 
  Citizens must cooperate by informing the police when they 
know about the location of drug sales, otherwise, youths will 
continue to be caught in the drug net, Fundora reiterated.

  [Text] A Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) source 
reported that during his trip to the United States Foreign 
Relations Minister-Designate Gabriel Lewis Galindo discussed 
possible joint actions between the two governments to fight drug 
trafficking and money laundering. 
  According to the source, Lewis Galindo also discussed the 
possibility of Panama's joining the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA). The source said that Galindo met with 
President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares to deliver a detailed 
report on his discussions with the U.S. Government. It was 
learned that one of the points most discussed by Galindo and 
U.S. authorities was the establishment of possible formulas to 
fight drug-money laundering. 
  He said that the U.S. authorities are concerned about 
Panama's image abroad as a money laundering center through its 
banking centers. The source said that another topic discussed 
was the reduction of U.S. troops in Panamanian territory. 
Likewise, the source reported that Perez Balladares will today 
travel to Bocas del Toro Province where he will announce a 
series of government investments he plans to implement after he 
takes office in September.

  [Excerpt] The Chamber of Deputies on 9 June passed a draft 
bill approving an agreement to cooperate in the prevention and 
control of the laundering of money derived from the illegal 
trade of drugs and narcotics. The document was signed between 
the Paraguayan and U.S. Governments in November 1993. 
  Deputy Constantino Mencia Ayala, head of the Drug 
Enforcement 
Committee, argued in favor of approving the bill considering the 
need for mutual cooperation to control drug traffickers' 
international money laundering. 
  He said the agreement's purpose was to eradicate money 
laundering through adequate cooperation between the two 
governments, particularly considering the major increase in 
mafia-linked financial operations to launder dollars obtained 
through the sale of narcotics. 
  Deputies passed the bill by a broad margin and immediately 
sent it to the executive branch for promulgation. [passage

  [Text] The U.S. Government decision to withdraw the radars 
used for the detection of drug traffickers' light planes 
entering Peru and Colombia created discontent and uncertainty in 
different political circles. 
  Legislators said the United States must assume its share of 
responsibility for the U.S. market's influence on drug 
trafficking activities in the region. 
  Foreign Relations Committee President Oswaldo Sandoval 
(NM-C90) [New Majority-Change 90] said it is difficult to 
explain why the country that consumes most of the drugs cannot 
take adequate measures to help producer nations. 
  "The issue is not how to resolve the problem in the United 
States but how to prevent our countries from producing the drug. 
We need all possible help for this struggle. It is inconsistent 
to withdraw the radars," Sandoval said. 
  The legislator stressed the importance of military 
operations 
to capture planes carrying drugs, which was possible precisely 
thanks to the support provided by those radars. 
  Sandoval said, however, that the radars are owned by the 
United States and the country has the right to withdraw them. 
  Concerning the report in Washington saying that the Peruvian 
Government has forbidden the entry of U.S. warplanes in our air 
space in answer to the radars' withdrawal, the legislator said 
the information was based on an unconfirmed press report. 
  Sandoval said Peru can take measures to make the U.S. 
Government understand that its cooperation is necessary. 
  "We are a very poor country to assume all the responsibility 
for a shared problem. The United States is also responsible. If 
it were not for the millions of consumers in that country our 
region would not produce as much drugs," Sandoval stressed. 
  Agreements Must Be Respected 
  Congressman Luis Enrique Tord (CD) [Democratic Coordinating 
Group] expressed surprise at the international treatment of an 
issue that concerns the entire world community, as is the case 
of drug enforcement. Tord said decisions made by governments on 
the issue must be consistent with their representatives' 
speeches. 
  Tord said more efforts are needed to control and dominate 
the 
scourge, and the United States should cooperate in this struggle 
with high technology. 
  Tord said the agreement for the installation and operation 
of 
radars in support of the Air Force to control the entry of drug 
traffickers' light planes into our territory should be respected. 
  The congressman added that the United States must clearly 
define its policies to support Peru. 
  "Peru must continuously remind the U.S. Government about the 
need to fulfill these types of agreements, which are closed 
after complex political and military conversations," the 
legislator stressed. 
  Regarding the downing of planes, which is opposed by U.S. 
authorities, Tord said the matter involves military, technical, 
and political decisions that must be reviewed. 
<H5>  Not Too Friendly Attitude </H5>
  Congressman Henry Pease (MDI) [Democratic Left Movement] 
characterized the gesture of withdrawing the radars installed in 
Peru and Colombia without previous warning as not too friendly. 
The radars helped control the movement of planes carrying drugs 
in accordance with the drug enforcement agreement signed with 
the United States. 
  "Our Foreign Ministry should take the initiative in these 
and 
other matters to improve our relations and to prevent small 
conflicts from affecting our drug enforcement effort, which 
should be a priority for the country," Pease said. 
  In his opinion, Peru must demand fulfillment and take the 
initiative to fulfill what has been signed by the two 
governments. 
  Regarding the Peruvian decision to forbid the entry of U.S. 
AWAC and P-3 planes, Pease said the Air Force has the 
responsibility to watch over the national territory.

  [Text] Peru will continue to fight illegal drug trafficking 
as originally planned, despite the virtual decision by the U.S. 
Government to end the supply of information obtained by radar on 
the alleged air transportation of drugs. 
  This comment was made yesterday by General Arnaldo Velarde 
Ramirez, retired, the Peruvian representative before the 
Inter-American Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse 
(CICAD) of the OAS, who said there is no official report from 
the U.S. Government on this issue. 
  He added: "All we know is of a decision by the U.S. Defense 
Department, which is not the official position of the U.S. 
Government." 
  Velarde said the lack of information on narco-planes over 
Peruvian territory hurts drug enforcement considerably "but the 
government's political will is very strong. Peru will continue 
to fight trafficking with or without this information by using 
its own capabilities." 
  Velarde labeled the U.S. decision as unilateral and 
temporary, adding that it is "probably a decision made by the 
U.S. Defense Department."

  [Text] Peruvian Air Force [FAP] spokesmen have asserted 
that there is no express ban on U.S. Air Force `Awacs' and 
`Orion' planes overflying Peruvian territory, as was stated in 
U.S. press reports. 
  The reports state that the alleged measure is a Peruvian 
`reprisal' to the U.S. decision to suspend the supply of 
information collected by these aircraft which is very necessary 
for the FAP to intercept the traffickers' planes. 
  The consulted sources stated that the problem is simply that 
the U.S. South Command has not requested permission to enter 
Peruvian airspace. 
  Under international laws, no country can prohibit air 
traffic 
over its territory. All that is necessary is to request a 
permit and to state the route that will be followed. 
  The sources stated that the antinarcotic agreement, the part 
concerning the FAP, is still in force and this is why the radar 
sent by the Panama-based U.S. South Command is still in 
Yurimaguas. Although this radar is obsolete, whenever it is not 
out of order it helps somewhat the Tucano aircraft to intercept 
traffickers planes. 
  FAP spokesmen admitted that the `electronic intelligence' 
supplied by U.S. `Awacs' and `Orion' is of vital importance for 
the interdiction operations against traffickers planes and 
without their participation the Air Force's operations would not 
be as effective.

  [Text] Lima, 6 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian Air Force (FAP) 
commander General Jose Nadal Paiva has resigned suddenly. 
General Enrique Astete replaced him as the FAP commander today. 
  Nadal submitted his resignation just as the U.S. Government 
halted the supply of radar obtained information to the FAP for 
use in the struggle against drug trafficking. According to 
military sources, the two are in no way connected. 
  The same sources stated that the Air Force commander 
resigned 
for "very personal reasons." Other sources stated that he 
resigned for health reasons. 
  Nadal Paiva should have retired, due to his age, in 1993 but 
continued following a decision by Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori, who is also commander in chief of the Armed Forces by 
a mandate of the Constitution. 
  The new FAP commander was the Air Force chief of staff and 
prior to that director of military operations and attache at the 
Peruvian Embassy in the United States.

  [Text] Lima, 11 Jun (AFP) -- The Peruvian Government 
extended the state of emergency for 60 days beginning today in 
several provinces of three Amazonian departments, because 
"narcoterrorist actions continue" there, it was officially 
reported today. 
  Meanwhile, the Police reported that on the evening of 10 
June 
two policemen and a private agent who were guarding stores--the 
former two in the capital city District of El Agustino and the 
third in San Miguel--were overpowered by presumed Shining Path 
commando units, who seized their weapons. The attackers made 
death threats against the three attack victims and threw 
leaflets referring to the "armed struggle" and expressing 
opposition to the government. 
  This special measure, which is contained in a supreme decree 
published by the EL PERUANO official gazette, affects the 
provinces of the jungle departments of Huanuco, San Martin, and 
Loreto. The provision implies the suspension of constitutional 
guarantees in the areas mentioned and also means that the Armed 
Forces will continue to guarantee public order. 
  Official figures indicate that more than 60 percent of 
national territory falls under this regime and that the 
constitutional guarantees of nearly 50 percent of the Peruvian 
population (22,128,466 inhabitants) have been restricted since 
the start of the "fratricidal war" in 1980 in Ayacucho, in the 
southeastern Andean region, which has claimed more than 27,000 
lives.

Record"] 
  [Excerpts] 
<H5>  The Drug Threat in Western China </H5>
  As international drug dealing activity adds fuel to the 
flames, some drug dealers outside of China dream of using 
mainland China as a stepping stone or "golden channel" for 
shipping drugs from southeast Asia to Hong Kong and the Americas 
by taking advantage of China's special geographical location 
bordering on the world's biggest drug planting and producing 
area, the "Golden Triangle". Chinese drug dealers, in collusion 
with dealers outside China, have established two major drug 
shipping channels, and one of these is the 
Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi-Guangdong-Hong Kong line, the earliest 
drug shipping route in China. After suffering severe setbacks, 
criminals have taken advantage of such things as the vast spaces 
of northwest China, the various nationalities living there, a 
backward economy, a high level of illiteracy, the low 
educational level of the population, and the critical phenomenon 
of drug planting and drug use which existed before liberation. 
They have created another overland drug shipping channel in for 
such drugs as heroin and opium, shipping them via Yunnan-western 
Sichuan or Tibet-Qinghai-Gansu, making Gansu's historical silk 
road into today's "drug shipping channel." There is now also 
illegal hemp planting in Xinjiang, with the hemp spreading 
chiefly toward the eastern coastline via long and narrow Gansu. 
After the drugs are collected in Gansu, they are distributed 
following individual lines: Lanzhou-Xian-Zhengzhou, then south 
down to Guangzhou along the Jingguang railway line via 
Zhengzhou, and to Xuzhou along the Longhai railway line; 
Lanzhou-Yinchuan-Huhehaote. Drug dealers appreciate this "land 
transmission line" very much, calling it a gold channel for 
"staying clear of the government's main forces and striking at 
the government's weak points." Where the drug dealers are most 
crafty is in not only taking advantage of such weak points as 
northwest China's backward economy and shortages of police, but 
also evilly exploiting such weak points the government's 
minority policy and imperfect legal system. 
  This golden channel which brings huge "profits" to drug 
dealers brings unprecedented drug disaster to the people who 
live along this line. Some cities along the line have one by one 
walked into the black whirlpool. Following Yunnan, the nation's 
first critical drug disaster area, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia 
have also become areas in which drugs run wild. Among these, the 
situation in Gansu is a relatively serious situation. In such 
places as Lanzhou's Little West Lake area, drug dealers and drug 
users are running wild. Some criminal elements are audacious in 
the extreme, daring even to commit crimes in the very face of 
the government's war on drugs. Some of them deal in drugs to 
support their own use, and some deal in drugs just for financial 
gain, although they fully understand the dangers involved. 
  On 3 December 1993, the LANZHOU WANBAO, the most popular 
newspaper in the Lanzhou area with a circulation of nearly 
200,000, carried an item which must have frightened the drug 
dealers: "The drug lord Escobar, head of the Colombian Medellin 
drug cartel, the world's biggest, was killed on 2 December." On 
27 November, the newspaper reported that on 23 November, with 
the assistance of the masses, police officers caught a drug 
dealer who carried 96.3 grams of heroin. On December 4th, the 
newspaper carried another item in a prominent spot in its first 
edition concerning firm prohibitions on drugs, and the severe 
punishment of drug dealers: "Three drug dealers who were dealing 
in less than one gram of drugs were sentenced." This news 
announced that: "The Municipal Intermediate People's Court has 
firmly implemented the National People's Congress Standing 
Committee's `Decision concerning prohibitions on drugs' and the 
directives of upper level courts which asks that every county 
and prefectural court should in general hand down sentences in 
cases of sales, transport, and manufacture of 1 gram or more of 
heroin once they are prosecuted. For a few drug cases with 
critical histories, even if the quantity is less than 1 gram, 
once they are prosecuted, their crime should still be announced 
and the sentences tend to be harsh. The Metropolitan District 
Court's recent sentencing of drug dealers Zeng Zhiyong [2582 
2535 0516], Yu Wenji [0060 2429 4949] and Wang Hanjie [3076 3466 
2638] set a precedent in this city for sentencing criminals 
dealing in less than one gram of heroin. Zeng Zhiyong was 
sentenced to one year's surveillance and fined 300 yuan, Yu 
Wenji was sentenced to one year's imprisonment, and Wang Hanjie 
was sentenced to six months' imprisonment." 
  This bit of news made drug dealers and users tremble with 
fear, and brought rejoicing to Lanzhou residents who have 
suffered the damages of drugs and worry about drugs running out 
of control. It is really strict enforcement since dealing one g 
of drugs will be punished. Since a drug user uses 1 gram of 
heroin per day, who will dare to use them anymore? 
<H5>  What Shows in the Drug Rehabilitation Center </H5>
  Drugs are threatening western China, a white devil attacking 
our golden cities. It is urgent that we attack drug dealing, and 
it is also an efficient measure. By speedily helping drug users 
to escape drug addiction, we can avoid having drug users follow 
the criminal path of theft, robbery, murder, pornography, etc., 
to obtain the money they need to buy drugs. It will prevent 
their losing their minds when addicted, and adopting 
self-destructive and suicidal behavior, crazy behavior such as 
destroying property and even endangering the safety of others. 
This has become another difficult task which must be 
accomplished during the war on drugs. 
  "In the history of drug rehabilitation throughout the world, 
there are two major routes to rehabilitation: forcible drug 
rehabilitation through education via labor in places of labor 
education, and active drug rehabilitation through hospital 
treatment. The first kind is not only injurious to health, it 
has had extremely bad results. Currently, China lacks the 
financial capacity to conduct isolated drug rehabilitation, 
while group drug rehabilitation causes addicts to follow others 
in their evil deeds, so more rehabilitation means a firmer drug 
problem. Once they are released from labor education without 
forceful control, drug users return to the wrong road again 
under the pressure of drug addiction. There is a quite high 
recidivist rate of drug use after release from labor education. 
Hospital drug rehabilitation is divided into medical drug 
rehabilitation treatment and psychological drug rehabilitation. 
It can rehabilitate drug addicts both physically and 
psychologically, and has a lower rate of those returning to drug 
use." These were the words of China's first generation drug 
rehabilitation expert, Associate Senior Physician Xu Fusheng 
[1776 4395 3932], Director of the Air Force Lanzhou First 
Hospital Drug Rehabilitation Center, and Chief Member of the 
Gansu Provincial Physical Restoration Association, during our 
interview at the hospital on 4 December 1993. 
  This drug rehabilitation center is one of the first work 
units in the northwestern five provinces to conduct drug 
rehabilitation. It has strong actual strength, significant 
achievements and rapid results. By adopting Chinese traditional 
medicine, Western medicine, and the means of combining Chinese 
and Western medicine, drug users can be rid of their addiction 
in three days, and can be restored and leave the hospital in 
about half a month. There have been especially good results from 
the "Miracle stop drug addiction" herbal medicine. Since March 
of 1988, this hospital has accepted for rehabilitation over 
12,200 drug users from throughout the nation, and has handled 
more than 5,000 personal inquiries at the clinic. Drug users and 
their families call it "the world's heavenly palace for 
rebirth," and "a crucible for the return of prodigal sons." 
After paying a visit, one writer praised it highly, saying, 
"Nothing can compare with the return of prodigal sons; good 
doctors make drug users get rid of their addiction!" [passage

  [Text] Rangoon, June 13 (AFP) -- The Burmese military 
overran two base camps of the Shan state warlord Khun Sa at the 
weekend, killing at least 32 guerrillas and losing 17 of their 
own men, the New Light of Myanmar newspaper said Monday. 
  News of the assault Saturday in Burma's eastern Shan state 
had been preceded by a campaign in the official press denouncing 
Khun Sa as a drug-runner and a "murderous terrorist." 
  If a person found in possession of just 15 grams of heroin 
deserves the death sentence, then Khun Sa, who deals in hundreds 
of tons of drugs, deserves the death sentence more than 100 
times over, the paper said. 
  The report said the military also had 31 wounded in the 
attack on camps where 600 of Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army (MTA) 
fighters were based. 
  The military seized 47 weapons, 199 mines, 304 hand 
grenades, 
53 mortar rounds, 53 assorted rockets, 7,800 rounds of 
ammunition and other equipment as well as 3.5 pounds (1.6 
kilograms) of marijuana, the daily said. 
  Lieutenant General Tin Oo, the army chief of staff and 
commander of the No.1 bureau of special operations, had visited 
the area from June 9 to 11 to encourage front-line troops, the 
paper said. 
  In the continuing press campaign, an article Monday 
described 
Khun Sa's nationalist pose as "media hype." 
  "He is a mere criminal ... and his group is also a mere drug 
ring or a murderous terrorist group," the article said.

  [Text] Rangoon, June 7 (AFP) -- Burma alleges that Western 
nations are deliberately distorting its drug production figures 
as part of their drive to put pressure on the government for 
political change. 
  Burmese officials said that the West, and particularly the 
United States, intentionally inflated the annual drug yield in 
Burma while refusing to recognize Rangoon's efforts at 
combatting the problem. 
  In a veiled reference to pro-democracy activist Aung San Suu 
Kyi, now in her fifth year of house arrest, Colonel Kyaw Win, 
deputy director of defense services intelligence, said: "As far 
as this factor exists, we will be over-assessed." 
  "Whatever we do, the West will downplay us," he said. 
  He and other officials interviewed over the past week never 
mentioned the country's leading dissident by name, but instead 
referred to Aung San Suu Kyi most frequently as "the factor," or 
occasionally as "the lady." 
  In conversations with AFP, officials also complained that 
warlord Khun Sa, who has been battling Rangoon government troops 
for autonomy in the Shan state, was being portrayed by some as a 
freedom fighter. 
  "He is a drug runner, and we take him as that," Kyaw Win 
said, adding there would be no peace talks with Khun Sa. 
  Officials pointed to crop substitution programs begun in 
border areas where Rangoon has signed peace agreements with a 
majority of the armed rebel groups who formerly fought the 
central government. 
  U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents were given 
access 
to these areas for assessment, Kyaw Win said, but there was a 
high disparity" between their field reports and the figures 
eventually published in Washington. 
  U.S. officials had no immediate comment. Western drug agency 
sources dismissed the charge, but one Western diplomat remarked 
that the allegation was "not impossible." 
  Western nations have assessed Burma's annual production of 
illicit opium, mainly in border areas forming part of the Golden 
Triangle, at around 2,500 tonnes--a figure which Rangoon 
officials said was exaggerated. 
  Rangoon has, meanwhile, denied reports of major battles with 
Khun Sa's Maung Tai Army (MTA) in the Shan state, describing the 
fighting as only localized operations. 
  Asked about Khun Sa's claims of heavy losses by government 
troops, Kyaw Win acknowledged there were casualties, but "not as 
much as Khun Sa says." 
  A Rangoon-based diplomat concurred, saying casualties were 
running three-to-one, with Khun Sa's attacking forces suffering 
more than government troops operating from defensive positions. 
  Once the remaining Karen, Mon and Karenni rebel groups had 
signed peace agreements with Rangoon, Kyaw Win said, "we will go 
all out against Khun Sa." 
  He and other officials declined to say when such agreements 
might be concluded, but indicated that contacts were continuing. 
  Diplomats and other observers said they saw little prospect, 
however, for an early agreement with the Karen, who are believed 
to have the strongest rebel fighting force still in action 
against the government.

    [Editorial Report] The 21 May HANGUK ILBO reported on page 
31 that the Pusan District Prosecutor's Office has arrested Yi 
Chang-sung for distributing philopon [crystal methamphetamine] 
and heroin from Thailand. The authorities also have arrest 
warrants for Kim Chong-kyu who is suspected of engineering the 
smuggling, and two others for carrying the drugs into the 
country. Yi was arrested with 226 grams of philopon and 287 
grams of heroin. The Golden Triangle heroin has been found in 
the past, but this the first time Thai-manufactured philopon and 
Thai-processed heroin were found in Korea. 
  According to the Prosecutor's Office, in February, Kim 
Chong-kyu smuggled one kilogram each of philopon and heroin 
worth eight billion won from Bangkok, Thailand, and Yi has 
helped sell these drugs since March. The authorities had a tip 
that Kim made three trips to Thailand this year alone and he 
supposedly smuggled five kilograms of Thai philopon into Korea 
on his April trip. Kim's possible connection

  [Text] Yesterday in Vientiane, a meeting took place 
between the Lao National Committee for Control and Suppression 
of Narcotic Drugs [LNCCSND] and a high-level delegation of the 
U.S. Government. The Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] 
was represented at the meeting by Souban Salitthilat, deputy 
foreign affairs minister and chairman of the LNCCSND, while the 
U.S. side was led by Richard Lee Brown, director of the U.S. 
Office of National Drug Control Policy [ONDCP] attached to the 
U.S. presidential office. 
  At the meeting, the two sides reviewed achievements made by 
the Lao and U.S. Governments in implementing a project designed 
under the memorandum of understanding on cooperation in narcotic 
drugs issues signed by the two countries on 30 September 1989. 
The spirit of the memorandum has so far been translated into a 
comprehensive rural development project launched in Meuang Son 
District, Sam Neua Province, aimed at reducing production and 
trafficking in narcotic drugs. Since 1990, the Lao side's task 
force has seized 905 kilos of opium, 155 metric tons of 
marijuana, and over 34 kilos of heroin. Also, the Lao side 
officially set up an office for the Committee for Control and 
Suppression of Narcotic Drugs on 20 May 1994. 
  The U.S. delegation arrived in Laos at noon on 7 June.

  [Text] The Thai deputy prime minister confirms that 
Thailand is prepared to cooperate with the United States in 
narcotics suppression. 
  After a meeting with the visiting director of the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration [DEA], Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai 
Wirawan said that there should be greater international 
cooperation in narcotics prevention and suppression than there 
currently is and cooperation should be carried out by all sides 
concerned. [begin recording] 
  Amnuai: There is little cooperation at both the 
national and international levels. I think that there is a need 
for greater collaboration in policy planning, manpower, and 
financial cooperation. Regarding Southeast Asia, the U.S. 
official said that this region is the production base that 
supplies about 60 percent of the heroin in the U.S. market. He 
expressed concern that this problem is intensifying. Thailand, 
however, is prepared to render cooperation. 
  In addition, he said that his country also would further 
cooperation with every other neighboring country, especially the 
countries which are major sources of narcotics production. This 
is because some countries are not able to solve the problems 
themselves. The policies to solve the narcotics problem and to 
develop the economy should be implemented concurrently. Citing 
the case of Thailand as an example, hill tribe people, 
villagers, or farmers are encouraged to convert their crops from 
narcotics plants to other crops provided they are able to earn 
sufficient incomes. [end recording]

  [Text] Ba'labakk, Lebanon, June 6 (AFP) -- Lebanon on 
Monday denied Israeli reports that it had failed in its campaign 
to eradicate hashish and poppy growing in the Syrian-controlled 
al-Biqa' Valley, as a UN delegation was set to begin drug talks 
here. 
  "Israel is trying to undermine Lebanon and Syria's 
reputations," the head of the national anti-drug commission, 
Sultan Haydar, told AFP. 
  He dismissed as "provocation" a report published on May 27 
by 
the Israeli daily MA'ARIV alleging that Israel was developing a 
"biological weapon" to destroy Lebanese poppy fields to end 
drug-trafficking across the border. 
  "There isn't a single plant of hashish or poppy in the 
Ba'labakk-al-Hirmil region (of the al-Biqa')," Haydar said. 
  "For the third consecutive year the Lebanese armed forces, 
assisted by the Syrian army, have eliminated drugs from that 
region and violators are being punished," added Haydar, who is 
also an advisor to the agriculture minister. 
  A delegation of the UN Development Program for the fight 
against drugs in Lebanon was to start a five-day visit in 
Lebanon on Monday to discuss efforts to eradicate the growing of 
hashish and poppy from the al-Biqa' Valley. 
  A spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry said the delegation 
would visit the Ba'labakk region in the al-Biqa' to get first 
hand information on the joint Lebanese-Syrian efforts. 
  According to MA'ARIV the Israeli police last year called on 
the most advanced genetic engineering techniques to develop a 
gene, based on poppy derivatives, capable of destroying up to 70 
percent of the Lebanese crop. 
  Israel's coordinator in Lebanon Uri Lubrani told MA'ARIV 
that 
once there is peace with Syria and Lebanon "and the opening of 
borders I don't even want to think about the catastrophe that 
could take place." 
  An Israeli police spokesman has declined to confirm or deny 
the report.

<F P=106> [By Mushtaq Ahmed] </F>
  [Text] Marijuana cultivation has increased alarmingly in 
the three districts of Chittagong Hill Tracts [CHT's] and the 
hilly areas of Cox's Bazar District. It is estimated that 
annual production in these areas is more than 500 metric tons. 
Almost all tribal families living in the inaccessible hilly 
areas of the three districts of Rangamati, Khagrachhari, and 
Bandarban in CHT's have become involved in marijuana 
cultivation. Different sources say that the large-scale 
cultivation is in accordance with a conspiracy to convert the 
CHT's into a "second Golden Triangle." It also has been learned 
that the process of producing superior quality drugs from 
marijuana has already started in the area. People entrusted 
with the responsibility of preventing the production of 
marijuana and destroying the crops are remaining silent, even 
after realizing the seriousness of the matter. More area in the 
hilly regions therefore are being turned to cultivation of this 
dangerous plant. 
  Different sources say that about 80 percent of the marijuana 
produced in these areas is smuggled to Saudi Arabia, Greece, the 
United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Bangkok. The drug 
traffickers use Greek ships anchored in deep water. A large 
mafia group is engaged in the entire process, from cultivation 
to smuggling. Many people believe that some Department of 
Narcotics and Liquor officials are directly involved in this 
issue. Marijuana crops stretch over an eight-mile area on both 
sides of the Barmmachhari canal 15 miles east of Fatikchhari 
police station. This marijuana garden extends from the new 
Barmmachhari market to the old one. In Khagrachhari District, 
marijuana covers a three-mile area. The leaves of these plants 
are very developed. Marijuana is also being cultivated in large 
areas on the western and eastern side of Ranirhat and Bethbunia 
in the deep jungles of Rangamati District. Large areas of land 
patroled by the Mahalchhari police station in Rangamati District 
are also under cultivation. In Bandarban District, there are 
large tracts under cultivation on both sides of a canal located 
about eight miles east of the district headquarters. In Cox's 
Bazar District, marijuana is being cultivated inside the hills 
at a place about seven miles from the Ukhiya police station. 
  At the beginning, people from Barisal District who have 
settled in these areas began marijuana cultivation in 
collaboration with a mafia group. They thought that this was a 
profitable business. Later, the Rohingya refugees who came to 
Bangladesh also became involved. Marijuana is being cultivated 
in 16 kanis [about eight acres] located on the eastern side of 
the Maricha market patroled by the Ukhiya police station. It is 
also being cultivated on a large-scale basis in an area covering 
more than eight to nine miles in the deep forests east of the 
Ramu police station. In this area, it is mainly the people from 
Barisal District and the Rohingya refugees who are engaged in 
its cultivation. 
  Apart from these areas, marijuana is being cultivated in 
large tracts in the three districts of CHT's and Cox's Bazar. 
Cultivation began in these areas in 1985 when the government 
imposed a ban on marijuana production and use. An organized 
international mafia group is encouraging the poor people living 
in the hilly areas to cultivate marijuana by paying them in 
advance. They have started large-scale cultivation of the plant 
as they make a lot of profit from it. It has been learned that 
the mafia group buys the leaves of the marijuana plant at a very 
nominal price from these production centers. The dried leaves 
are loaded into trucks and brought to Chittagong city, with the 
bags of marijuana leaves hidden under vegetables. This 
marijuana is stored in underground warehouses in various parts 
of Chittagong city, including Patenga. Later, it is carried by 
small boats to ships berthed at the outer anchorage of 
Chittagong Port. 
  Marijuana is being purchased from the cultivators at the 
rate 
of 1,000 taka [about $25] per kg, but is loaded into ships at a 
cost of about $300 per kg. Though cultivation has increased 
alarmingly during the past few years, officials of the 
department concerned have not taken any action in this regard. 
It is reported that six tons of marijuana were seized once from 
Barmmachhari area. It is surprising that the informer who 
traced the location of these marijuana fields at the risk of his 
life and reported it to the concerned authorities has not been 
rewarded. It has been learned that he has gone into hiding, but 
the personnel of the Department of Narcotics and Liquor have not 
apprised the senior authorities of the matter. A question has 
arisen as to whether the government has been informed about this 
large-scale cultivation of marijuana. If it has been informed 
about it, then why is it not taking steps to destroy these 
marijuana gardens? The trusted people of the government high 
command should make an aerial survey of the areas under 
cultivation to verify the allegations. Informed quarters feel 
that if the government fails to take timely action, then it will 
become difficult to foil the conspiracy which has been hatched 
to convert these areas into the second Golden Triangle.

  [Text] Bombay, May 8. In the largest-ever seizure of 
Indian manufactured heroin, the narcotics cell of the city 
police recently seized 11 kg of the drug, valued at Rs 22 lakhs 
in the Indian market, and Rs 15 crores in the international 
markets. 
  This seizure of heroin, the third in the city within a 
month, 
strengthens the suspicion that the trafficking in Indian heroin 
is a rapidly growing component of the drugs trade whose terminus 
is Bombay. 
  Acting on a tip-off, the police arrested Mohammed Usman 
Gulam 
Husein Chhipa, 35, a resident of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh, at 
Cotton Green, with 23 packets of the drug. He was on his way to 
deliver it to a customer. 
  Interrogation has revealed that the drug was supplied to him 
by Mohammed Ahsan, a well-known dealer in the illicit drug 
trade. Ahsan, granted bail by the Madras high court in a DRI 
[Directorate of Revenue Intelligence] case involving a 300-kg 
seizure of opium, visited that city last month. He is now 
absconding, according to the Madhya Pradesh police. 
  "Greed," is Usman's one-word reply, when asked what made him 
do it. He is a garment dealer. He used to purchase used clothes 
in Bhendi Bazaar and sell them in Mandsaur, and has been a 
carrier for the last eight or ten months. "Through the grace of 
God, I was comfortably off. But it was sheer greed that led me 
into this." The load he was arrested with was the largest he had 
carried. Previously he had only carried around five kg. 
  According to Usman, the contraband was to be delivered on 
April 27, by a truckdriver named Rashid. However, the delivery 
was delayed because Rashid's truck broke down along the way, and 
Usman finally received it on May 4. It was to be delivered by 
him to two men, identified only as Fazal and Ravi, both 
residents of Kanjarpada in Agripada. 
  His interrogation has given the police tantalising clues to 
an ongoing territory squabble between two groups of M.P. drug 
dealers. Ahsan is stated to be in competition with one Fazal 
over which group will supply the gangsters who run the Agripada 
distribution network. 
  "Earlier the drug used to be rough and granular," says the 
deputy commissioner of police in charge of the narcotic cell, 
Mr. Rahul Rai-Sur. "Now it is smoother and more powdery. That 
indicates a greater degree of refinement, and therefore, the 
increasing technical expertise of the clandestine chemists 
operating there." 
  Mr. Sur estimated that about 110 kg of opium probably went 
into the manufacture of the present load. In Mandsaur district, 
he said, there were as many as 68,000 cultivators of the poppy, 
and a total of 6,800 hectares under cultivation. 
  One of the earlier seizures consisted of a load of two kgs 
of 
heroin, seized from a chawl in Kurla. In that case Rafiq 
Mohammed Jullaiya, and Abdul Hamid Mansuri, were arrested. It 
was revealed to have been manufactured in Ujjain. The other 
load, of 2.2 kgs, worth around Rs 4.4 lakhs, originated in 
Chittorgarh in Rajasthan. A man and a woman, from Jogeshwari and 
Santa Cruz, respectively, were arrested. It was learnt that the 
drug had been bought from two residents of Jawra, also in M.P., 
Irad Khan and Ramesh. Irad Khan has been arrested by a police 
team.

  [Excerpt] Kapren (Bundi), May 2. Policing in this historic 
district, 190 km south of Jaipur, has taken a different turn now 
with the decline of terrorism in Punjab. Although the police 
heaved a sigh of relief after peace descended in neighbouring 
Punjab focus has now shifted to prevention of smuggling of 
narcotics and opium from the nearby districts of Mandsaur, 
Ratlam and Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh and Jhalawar, Kota and 
Baran in Rajasthan. Other incidents of social crime have also 
increased, the genesis of which can be traced to the 
multi-purpose river project on the Chambal river. 
  According to the SP, Bundi, Mr. Srinivas Rao Janga, "Since 
the late 1960s, when construction of the Chambal project 
commenced, migrants from Punjab started settling in the southern 
belt of Bundi in large numbers mostly in Alphanagar. With 
terrorism at its zenith in Punjab a strict vigil was kept on the 
activities of Punjabis settled in Sriganganagar and Bundi." In 
1991, acting on a tip off, the district police raided the 
residence of one Harbail Singh and arrested six noted ultras. 
  This district, unlike Sriganganagar, was not a hot-bed of 
terrorism, but according to Mr. Janga, due to its strategic 
location and remoteness was an "ideal hiding place" for 
terrorists. "The situation has changed today and Bundi is 
emerging as a conduit for opium trade in the Hadauti (southern 
Rajasthan) zone," he pointed out. 
  The Aravallis range runs through Bundi dividing the district 
into two near-halves. This demographic factor has had its impact 
on crime. The district is used as a major transit point for 
transportation of drugs to Delhi and from there to Nepal. It is 
suspected that due to stringent action by the Kota district 
police and other enforcement agencies, the opium smugglers have 
changed their route. "While originally the contraband was taken 
along Mandsaur, Jhalawar, Kota, Tonk and Jaipur, reports now 
reveal that from Kota it is diverted to Patan, Lakheri, 
Indergarh (all in Bundi) and to Sawai Madhopur from where on the 
broad gauge railway network the consignment is either despatched 
to Delhi or Bombay," Mr. Janga said. 
  Interestingly, while 14 and 23 cases were registered by the 
police here in 1992 respectively under the Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotrophic Substances Act (NDPS), a special vigil is being 
maintained on the basis of a report from the State intelligence 
Department at Jaipur, which expressed fears about the growing 
illegal trade. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, June 12, IRNA -- The terrorist Mojahedin 
Khalq Organization (MKO) is collaborating with international 
drug traffickers, an MKO member arrested recently, has disclosed. 
  The member, Motalleb Mahdavi, said MKO had to collaborate 
with international drug gangs after the Iraq-Iran war due to 
what the MKO ringleaders justified as "financial problems." 
  Mahdavi admitted that he himself was responsible for finding 
secure routes for the drug traffickers coming from Pakistan into 
Iran. 
  After the traffickers had entered Iran, they passed through 
the central `loot' desert and through Kerman and Isfahan 
Provinces, where the drugs were hidden in buses and tankers in 
order to be carried to Turkey and Europe via the city of 
Orumiyeh in west Azerbaijan Province, he added.

    [Editorial Report] A report by Tzvi Giv'on on page 4 of 
Tel Aviv HATZOFE in Hebrew on 5 June notes that Beni Arad, 
director general of the Antidrug Authority, said last Friday in 
Haifa that "the volume of drug trafficking in Israel amounts to 
$2.5 billion." Arad added that "there are about 200,000 casual 
drug users, of which 27,000 are high school students, and about 
30,000 drug addicts." He noted that "about four metric tons of 
heroin, five metric tons of hashish, and 500 kg of cocaine are 
consumed in Israel every year." 
  Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 7 June 
reports that Tel Aviv police detectives "uncovered a crate 
containing three metric tons of hashish soles, estimated at 30 
million shekels. This is the largest drug shipment ever 
smuggled into Israel. Our police affairs correspondent Shim'on 
Vilna'i reports that the hashish arrived at the port of Ashdod 
from the Far East aboard the Zim Tokyo. Detectives waited for 
over a month to see who would come to release the crate from 
customs, but when nobody turned up the crate was pried open and 
the hashish packages were found inside. No suspects have yet 
been arrested." 
  Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 8 June, in a page 
14 report by David Rudge, states that Galilee District Police 
yesterday arrested two suspected drug dealers and seized "two 
sacks containing 50 kg of hashish and a nylon bag containing a 
kilo of heroin" "worth hundreds of thousands of dollars on the 
streets." The capture was made after a "large-scale operation, 
involving members of the special Lebanese border unit and 
plainclothes officers."

  [Excerpt] Beirut today was the scene of an international 
antinarcotics field activity. Deputy Prime Minister Michel 
al-Murr chaired a meeting for the ministerial Antinarcotics 
Committee. The meeting was attended by Ministers Michel 
Samahah, Marwan Hamadah, and 'Adil Qirtas; representatives of 
the Army Command, the Internal Security Forces, and the Social 
Affairs Ministry; and a delegation from the UN antidrugs bureau 
[name as received]. Al-Murr explained the importance and 
details of the meeting: [begin recording] 
  al-Murr: In the latest 1993 report published by 
U.S media and cited by some Arab press, Lebanon was considered 
first in the world in exporting, producing, and growing drugs. 
The report specified the amount produced as 65,000 tons of 
hashish, opium, and others. In that report Lebanon was given a 
leading place in this dirty international activity. We stressed 
Lebanon's position to the UN representatives concerned with the 
drug issue. We told them that the figures mentioned in the 
report are incorrect, unrealistic, and baseless. We asked the 
United Nations, through its representatives who met with us 
today, to give us the information they have about Lebanon. They 
were here a year ago and we gave them accurate information and 
figures indicating that all rumors about Lebanon, disseminated 
to serve certain international objectives, are false. 
  There are no more opium or hashish plants in al-Biqa'. If 
security agencies occasionally seize some smuggled drugs, these 
are from old stock--more than three years old--hidden in secret 
places. The plants were destroyed and they no longer exist. 
  The UN officials told me that they have evidence that these 
plants no longer exist in Lebanon and that Lebanon is being 
wronged by media rumors that it is the primary exporter of drugs 
to the world. In the name of the government, I stressed our 
demand for a clear UN report telling the truth. We do not want 
a favor; we want them to tell the truth that Lebanon is no 
longer a producer or exporter of drugs. They promised that at 
the end of their visit to Lebanon this week--we gave them a 
chance to visit all concerned ministries and departments to 
collect facts and figures--they will forward a report. They 
became convinced after the documents we presented in the 
meeting. But this is not enough; we insisted that they present 
a report to the United Nations so that it, in its annual report, 
can say that Lebanon does not plant, produce, or export drugs.

  [Text] Karachi, June 5 -- Mumtaz Ahmed Burney, the senior 
superintendent of police [SSP], Crime Investigation Agency 
[CIA], voluntarily tendered his resignation after a controversy 
in which he was accused of helping the release of a suspect 
popularly known as "heroin king." 
  Mr Burney presented his resignation to the provincial chief 
secretary saying that he is resigning from the government job 
owing to some unavoidable circumstances, says a spokesman for 
the police. 
  The heroin king Showrang, an Afghan national, was arrested 
on 
May 17 by the CIA but on May 24, he was released on bail by ADM 
[expansion unknown]/CIA. 
  The sudden release of Showrang created an uproar in the 
recently set up Anti-Narcotics Task Force [ANTF] headed by some 
senior army officers. 
  On a protest by ANTF, the Interior Ministry ordered an 
enquiry into the matter. 
  Senior army officials accused the CIA chief of helping 
Showrang to go free without taking the military authorities into 
confidence. 
  Refuting the claims of the army, the CIA officials claimed 
that the ANTF and the Narcotics Control Board and others 
interrogated Showrang, but they did not have any past record of 
the accused. 
  CIA claimed that the accused is 70 years old with weak 
physique and is a heart patient. "During the course of 
interrogation he became senseless. As no further recoveries 
were expected from him, he was released on bail under section 
497 of Cr PC," the agency said. 
  CIA claimed that his wrist watch worth Rs [rupees] 400,000 
is 
still lying with CIA Karachi as personal search and if CIA 
officials have any sympathy with the accused then this valuable 
wrist-watch would have been returned back to him." [no 
beginning quote as received] 
  Police officials claimed that the Mr Burney has also 
requested the government for permission to approach higher 
courts to take action against the newspapers which have 
published incorrect news against him. 
  Later, in the night, it was learnt that the SSP CIA withdrew 
his resignation on a request by a senior Sindh minister.

<F P=106> [By Janine Lazarus] </F>
  [Excerpts] Police fear South Africa could be on the brink 
of a new drugs craze with the re-emergence of a deadly 
translucent powder called ice. [passage omitted] 
  This, the latest "designer drug" to find its way on to the 
streets, last surfaced several years ago when a man was arrested 
in Johannesburg for being in possession of a small amount of the 
powder. 
  SANAB's [South African Narcotics Bureau] Cape Town branch 
commander Captain Hennie Marais says use of the drug in this 
country could become a massive problem. "In Europe and America, 
usage has reached epidemic proportions." He says addicts are 
inclined to test anything new on the market. "If he can afford 
it, he will test it." 
  Captain Eddie Lightfoot, who heads Johannesburg's Drug Unit, 
says international drug syndicates are always looking for new 
destinations. "Now that South Africa has opened up, I think 
people are looking at using the country as a drug base and a 
possible conduit to other countries." [passage omitted] 
  The drug, which can either be injected when mixed with water 
that is then heated up, smoked or taken orally, is also known as 
"glass crystal", "candy" or "poor man's cocaine"--although it is 
not a cocaine derivative. Sold in five sachets each containing 
0.2 g, ice's street value is between R[Rand]30 and R35 per 
sachet, or about R150 a gram.

  [Excerpt] Munich (DPA) -- In the struggle against 
organized drug trafficking, the greatest ever success in Europe 
was achieved. In several European countries, more than 400 
kilograms heroin with a black market value of approximately 100 
million German marks [DM] were seized. In the operation, which 
was led by the Bavarian Land Office of Criminal Investigation 
[LKA], the "laundering of money" totalling DM50 million was 
reconstructed, of which DM2.5 million was confiscated, the LKA 
said in Munich on 9 June. In a large-scale police operation on 
6 June, 25 persons were arrested in Germany and Italy. In the 
Federal Republic, 21 banks and 20 other buildings were searched.

<F P=106> [Article signed MBO: "Eastern European Drug Trafficking </F>
Prospers] 
  [Text] The Russian drug empire is preparing to conquer 
Western Europe. Western amphetamine laboratories (ecstasy and 
others) are moving one after another, mainly to Poland. From 
the Netherlands, hashish plants are being taken by truck, mainly 
to Russia. As soon as the drug mafia has established itself 
properly in the former Eastern Bloc, much cheaper drugs will 
flood the Western European market. The European Commission (EC) 
is preparing a large campaign against drug abuse. Interpol 
Secretary General Raymond Kendall in London called for the 
decriminalization of drug possession. 
  Drug trafficking from former Eastern Bloc countries to 
Western Europe are assuming disturbing dimensions. That was the 
conclusion of a three-day international conference on helping 
drug users which took place in the Russian town of Kaliningrad. 
Carlo Baeten of the Center for Alcohol and Drug Problems (CAD) 
in Hasselt was the only Belgian to attend and addressed an 
international group of specialists, at the invitation of the 
Narcotic Federation of Moscow. 
  "The drug abuse problem is growing enormously over there due 
to the lack of economic prospects and any belief in the future 
among young people," Baeten said. "The drug mafia is throwing 
itself into this virgin territory. A daily dose of heroin costs 
scarcely 200 Belgian francs [BFr] over there compared with 
nearly BFr3,000 in Belgium. The Russian police are finding that 
an increasing number of amphetamine laboratories are starting 
up. They also know that there are new trafficking routes for 
heroin and cocaine. They are not just targeting the local 
market, but Western Europe as well thanks to their competitive 
prices." 
<H5>  European Plan </H5>
  The EC has drawn up a plan for combating drug abuse. Its 
main points are: Reducing drug use and implementing 
preventative measures among high-risk groups (young people, 
prisoners); combating drug trafficking by more controls on money 
laundering, more cooperation between police, customs and justice 
departments and the expansion of Europol; international 
agreements at the United Nations and the Council of Europe 
levels and agreements with other countries. 
  The action program will start next year and last until 1999. 
The EC will set aside 960 million for combating drug abuse. 
The number of addicts in the European Union is estimated at 1 
million. Five million Europeans are believed to use drugs 
occasionally. 
  In London yesterday [8 June] Raymond Kendall called for drug 
possession to be decriminalized. He believes that drug use is 
more of a social and health problem rather than a matter for the 
police. 
  "Combating symptoms is inefficient," Kendall said, expecting 
little benefit to be gained from the fight against drug dealers 
without tackling the problem situations which lead to drug use.

  [Text] Brussels, June 8 (AFP) -- The European Union's 
executive commission Wednesday urged the 12 member states to 
adopt a concerted strategy to fight drug trafficking and drug 
addiction. 
  The EU commissioner in charge of justice and internal 
affairs, Padraig Flynn, said "drug addiction and trafficking 
present a major threat for Europe's citizens." He said the 
problems called for a "coordinated reaction by the Union and its 
member states." 
  The action plan presented by Flynn suggests better use could 
be made of the Netherlands-based Europol to achieve police, 
customs and legal cooperation to fight drug trafficking. 
  The plan also suggests greater cooperation with third 
countries either in the framework of existing international 
agreements or by negotiating specific agreements.

<F P=106> [Michael Voelker report: "Already 63 Deaths From Drugs in </F>
Vienna This Year"] 
  [Text] For some florists in Vienna and in the provinces, 
the sale of poppy straw and poppy heads to addicts is a 
profitable business. The drug squad of the Vienna Security 
Office pointed to this trend in 1984 for the first time. 
However, this semi-legal drug trade is not interesting for the 
criminal police: In view of the alarmingly rising heroin and 
cocaine trade, the use of poppy heads to gain opiate-containing 
substances can be neglected. 
  "Poppy heads are no problem," Karl Lesiak of the Vienna 
Security Office says. In particular not now when the Austrian 
capital is being swamped with cheap and high-quality heroin. 
Within the past two years, the price for one gram of heroin has 
gone down from about 3,000 to 800 shillings. The decline in the 
price of cocaine is obvious, but not yet as dramatic: One gram 
now costs 1,200 to 1,500 schillings on average; two years ago 
one could not buy it for less than 2,500 schillings. 
<H5>  Further Increase </H5>
  In Vienna, the number of deaths from drugs rose from 94 in 
1992 to 103 in 1993. This year justifies the fear of a further 
increase: By the end of May 63 people had died of drugs. During 
the same period in 1993 the number was 48. 
  According to Karl Lesiak, most deaths are due to heroin 
overdoses. For three years one can observe a shift in the 
consumption of opiates from poppy head tea and codeine to 
high-quality heroin. The largest number of drug deaths are 
still caused by the "Vienna mixture" (opiates, pharmaceuticals, 
and alcohol), but the proportion of people who used heroin 
exclusively is rising. With one restriction: As the Forensic 
Institute in Vienna has found out in a comprehensive study, 
heroin is more and more often diluted with the soporific 
Rohypnol--probably without the knowledge of the consumers--which 
intensifies the effect. 
  In the field of drug smuggling, an essential change has also 
taken place for the police: Austria's eastern neighboring 
countries are used as "depot countries," the drugs are 
increasingly brought to Austria in small amounts and at short 
notice, depending on the demand. 
  The authorities have particular problems with the so-called 
"ant trade" with Bratislava. Addicts "import" 50 to 500 grams 
of the drugs themselves and finance the amounts they need for 
themselves by partly selling off the rest. Taxi drivers are 
also often used as drug couriers. At a salary of about 2,000 
schillings, they bear the entire risk, police access to the 
people behind them is becoming increasingly difficult. 
Nevertheless, according to Lesiak, the amount of heroin and 
cocaine seized this year has "increased considerably."

<F P=106> ["sig."-attributed report: "Special Troop on New Drug </F>
Route"] 
  [Text] Klagenfurt -- At the Thoerl-Maglern checkpoint, the 
Austrian customs authorities have established a new six-member 
special unit against international drug smuggling. "Since the 
beginning of the war in former Yugoslavia, a new drug route has 
developed from Turkey to the port of Trieste," Helmut Gram, 
chief of the Carinthian customs guard, reported on Monday. 
  Direct ferry-boats from Turkey with up to 140 truck trains 
on 
board arrive in Trieste three times a week. As international 
investigators know, for the major part of illegal drug 
smuggling, these new opportunities are used for supplies to 
Germany. About 50 percent of the arriving trucks cross the 
Italian-Austrian border in Thoerl-Maglern. For some weeks, five 
male and one female special officers, with the most modern 
equipment and a drug sniffer dog, have been on duty around the 
clock. Three members of the drug squad gathered experiences in 
Burgenland, where the first Austrian special unit against drug 
trafficking was established and is working successfully. 
  There will also be more controls on tourist traffic. "If 
there is any suspicion, it might take hours to search a 
passenger car," Gram said, "but in general it will be seen to 
that there are no major obstructions of the tourist traffic." 
Cooperation with the Italian customs and port authorities has 
developed well, the drug specialists reported.

  [Text] Jacques Chirac [Paris mayor and Rally for the 
Republic president] yesterday met with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. The half-hour meeting took place in U.S. Ambassador 
Pamela Harriman's residence in the rue du Faubourg St. Honore. 
The mayor of Paris was accompanied by Didier Quentin, the 
town's international relations director, and Pierre Lellouche, 
his foreign policy and defense adviser. Bill Clinton's 
entourage included U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
and Thomas McLarty, chief of the presidential staff. Jacques 
Chirac and Bill Clinton spent most of the meeting discussing 
international affairs, and in particular the Bosnian conflict. 
On this issue, they were agreed that the arms embargo should 
not be lifted. The RPR president also insisted on the 
seriousness of the situation in Algeria, which risks 
destabilizing the whole Maghreb region. Where nuclear testing 
is concerned, Jacques Chirac stressed the need for France to 
carry out a few more tests before switching over to test 
simulations. For his part, Bill Clinton expressed his concern 
about the growing risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction (nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological) and the 
danger that this represents, insofar as they could be used by 
terrorist groups. 
<H5>  Working Group </H5>
  Moreover, Jacques Chirac explained at length to the U.S. 
President his views on the urgent and vital need to attack the 
narcotics problem at the production stage. In particular, he 
stressed the considerable increase in the production of heroin 
and its consequences, especially for young people. 
  The former French prime minister also underscored the need 
to 
define a policy and take action, possibly under the aegis of the 
United Nations, to encourage countries producing narcotics to 
think about promoting alternative sources of revenue for their 
farmers. 
  President Clinton showed much interest in this proposal. The 
two men decided that regular contacts would be established 
between experts on both sides and that a working group would be 
set up to define a policy for the fight against narcotics 
production.

ring. A spokesman for the LKA said in Munich today, that in a 
large-scale operation in Munich, Hamburg, Duesseldorf, and 
Nuremberg earlier this week, police apprehended 14 Germans and 
Turks. They are suspected of having imported tons of heroin to 
Spain, Italy, and Germany. The spokesman added that another 10 
persons were arrested in northern Italy and Spain. In the 
operation, the officials also detected comprehensive money

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "BKA Sounds Drug Alarm"] </F>
  [Text] Wiesbaden -- The president of the Federal Criminal 
Office [BKA] Hans-Ludwig Zachert has issued a warning against 
the kind of drugs policy "that increases the number of addicts 
and at the same time turns the law-enforcement bodies into a 
kind of letter-scale police force [Briefwaagenpolizei]." 
  Speaking to DIE WELT, Zachert expressed himself publicly for 
the first time about the likely impact on the police of the 
Constitutional Court's ruling on hashish and on the subsequent 
North Rhine-Westphalian decree. The judges in Karlsruhe had 
decided that the possession of "small quantities" of hashish and 
marijuana would not be punishable in future. Later, North 
Rhine-Westphalian Justice Minister Rolf Krumsiek issued a decree 
also permitting smaller quantities of hard drugs like heroin, 
cocaine, and LSD, limiting the amount of heroin and cocaine that 
can be possessed to 0.5 grams. 
  According to Zachert, the German police will be placed in a 
ridiculous situation in the combatting of crime. "The police 
will be expected to obtain from organized drug dealers 
assurances that a confiscated supply of hard drugs was merely a 
small quantity, intended for occasional use," says Zachert. 
"Police investigators will find it extremely difficult to 
differentiate between a dealer and a consumer. The 
international drug business will adapt to the new situation and 
organize its drug supply is accordance with Germany's new 
regulations on drugs." The next objective of the drug dealers 
will be to establish further consumer markets for hard drugs. 
"And that will increase the number of hard drug addicts," says 
Zachert. 
  Zachert regrets the fact that the new policy on drugs, and 
the resultant trends, will make the state's preventive efforts 
more difficult. "It is difficult enough to explain to young 
people that they should avoid so-called soft drugs. But if the 
consumption of small quantities of soft drugs remains 
unpunishable, it is just a matter of time before they move on to 
increasing quantities of hard drugs," says Zachert. 
  This will have a negative effect on the fortunes of 
thousands 
of addicts, according to Zachert. "Apart from that, wherever 
soft drugs can be obtained, hard drugs are not far away," says 
Zachert. 
  Zachert claims that Eastern European drug rings are playing 
an increasing role in supplying the German market. For 
instance, the heroin in Germany no longer comes from just 
Pakistan, Afghanistan, or Iran, but also from central Asian 
countries like Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. Other 
than that, poppies have been grown in Ukraine for centuries, so 
the illegal drug market is also fed from there. 
  Poland almost plays a leading role in the supply of 
amphetamines to Western Europe. "But major centers of cocaine 
trade are also establishing themselves in Eastern Europe," says 
Zachert. "Investigations have revealed that the Colombian Cali 
cartel also has bases in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The 
quantities of drugs seized in Moscow indicate that more and more 
criminal elements from Western countries are taking advantage of 
the instability in the former Soviet Union for their own 
purposes."

<F P=106> [Article signed CV/LL/SH: "Lucerne: End of Investigation </F>
Into a Drug Trafficking Network--14 Arrested"] 
  [Text] Lucerne, 8 Jun (ATS) -- The Lucerne police forces 
have concluded an investigation into a drug trafficking network. 
A total of 14 individuals have been arrested since February 
thanks to the cooperation between the Swiss and foreign police 
forces. The investigators disclosed on Wednesday [8 June] that 
2.4 kg of cocaine had been seized. However, the real "heads" of 
the network have not been unmasked. One of them lived in 
Lucerne. He received supplies of cocaine from Brazil through 
different channels. The drug was meant mainly for the "markets" 
of Lucerne and Zurich, the police said. Since February, 12 
individuals have been apprehended in Switzerland and two others 
abroad. During the investigation, the police seized several 
Brazilian passports that had been stolen or bought on the black 
market. Moreover, cars have been confiscated as well as 180,000 
francs. 
  Unfortunately, it has proved impossible to locate the 
headquarters of the network. According to the chief of the 
criminal police of Lucerne, the traffickers were partly 
"financed by a Middle Eastern country."

  [Text] Frauenfeld, 7 June -- On Monday, two Turkish 
citizens carried out a drugs deal involving 3 kg of heroin a few 
meters away from the police station in Weinfeld. They were 
observed by the police and arrested. The Thurgau Investigations 
Office and police said on Tuesday that they had received

that drugs were going to be sold, the criminal and security 
police entered a shop owned by one of the two Turks and arrested 
both of them. They are suspected of organized crime. One of

<F P=106> [Article by Robi Dutta: "&pound;20m Drugs Seized in Armed </F>
 Raid"] 
  [Text] Armed police and Customs officers seized 80 kg of 
heroin, worth about &pound;20 million, in a raid on a house in 
London yesterday. It was the biggest haul of heroin this year. 
  Witnesses said three policemen smashed the door and a window 
of a two-story 1940s house in Hendon, northwest London. A 
Turkish man and a Briton from Finsbury Park, north London, were 
arrested. The raid, by Customs officers, police from the South 
East Regional Crime Squad and armed Metropolitan officers, 
followed a nine-month surveillance operation. 
  Customs said the quantity of the drug was unusually high but 
it was not known whether it indicated a rising trend in imports. 
"The suppliers usually import heroin in a fairly steady stream 
of amounts between 20 and 30 kg," a spokesman said. 
  On Tuesday, Customs officials seized 65 kg of cannabis worth 
more than &pound;200,000 from a Cypriot-registered ship, the 
Akron Issos, at Hollyhead, Anglesey. The vessel 
sailed from Jamaica.

<F P=106> [Article by Rachel Sylvester: "Jailed Britons `Conned' Into </F>
Carrying Narcotics"] 
  [Text] Britons are being duped into smuggling a drug which 
is legal in the United Kingdom but banned in others, say Foreign 
Office officials. 
  At least 25 Britons have been arrested in the past six 
months 
in Scandinavia, charged with carrying khat, a stimulant that is 
banned in America and most European countries. 
  Paul Watson, 34, from London, was arrested on Friday in 
Helsinki, Finland, for possessing 80 kilos of the khat plant 
leaves. 
  He told Finnish police he was en route to Stockholm and that 
this was his second trip as a courier. 
  Drugs support agencies fear that London has become the 
centre 
for an illegal trade in khat. 
  The Foreign Office suspects that a single organisation is 
employing the couriers because nearly all the arrested 
Britons--ranging in age from 24 to 59--have come from the 
Heathrow airport area in west London. 
  Release, the drug charity, said it had received dozens of 
calls from Londoners who had been offered &pound;50 to 
&pound;150 to 
carry khat abroad, mainly to Scandinavia and the United States. 
Some had answered small ads in local newspapers. 
  Khat--Catha edulis forsk--is a privet-like plant 
that produces mild euphoria when its leaves are chewed. 
  It is widely grown in the Horn of Africa, particularly 
Somalia and the Yemen, where chewing its bitter leaves is part 
of the culture. 
  Greengrocers sell it in Britain, particularly in areas with 
Somali and Yemeni immigrants. A bunch of leaves costs &pound;4. 
It 
raises blood pressure, increases heart beat and suppresses 
appetite. 
  Catherine Perez Phillips, a spokeswoman for Release said: 
"When people are asked to carry the drug they are not being told 
the truth. They are told that what they are being asked to do is 
legal." 
  Six Britons are still held in Oslo awaiting trial. Among 
them 
are Raymond and Joanne Edwards, from London, who were arrested 
at Oslo airport on April 7. 
  They said they had been offered &pound;50 each for the 
trip, and 
that this was the second time they had acted as couriers for the 
same agent. 
  Seven others arrested in Norway have been released and 
deported. 
  Six more Londoners are in prison awaiting trial in Sweden, 
three in Finland and three in Denmark. 
  British embassies are worried that the trafficking is 
becoming such a problem that the Scandinavian governments will 
make an example of some of the Britons by jailing them. 
  Until now the authorities have adopted a relaxed attitude 
and 
those found guilty of smuggling khat have only been deported. 
  A 1980 UN report said that prolonged chewing of khat can 
lead 
to dental and gastric diseases, cirrhosis of the liver, 
hypertension, migraine and cerebral haemorrhage.

<F P=106> [Article by Phillip Sherwell in Bangkok: "Briton Gave Me </F>
Drugs, Gregory Tells Thai Court"] 
  [Text] Sandra Gregory told a Bangkok court yesterday she 
tried to smuggle heroin out of Thailand to pay for her air fare 
home to Britain and to settle medical bills. 
  The 29-year-old teacher said Robert Lock, 28, a fellow 
Briton, brought the drugs to her guest house on the day of the 
flight. 
  "He told me it was heroin and he told me to conceal it 
inside 
myself," she said. 
  Gregory, who told the judge she had dengue fever, admits 
possessing 87g of heroin at Bangkok's Don Muang international 
airport on Feb 5, 1993. 
  Lock, from Cambridge, had paid her &pound;1,000 to take the 
drugs to Japan for him, said Gregory, from Sowerby Bridge, West 
Yorks. 
  "When we got to the airport I was approached at the 
check-in. 
The policeman pointed to Robert and asked if I came with him, I 
said yes. 
  "They took us to an office and started searching us. They 
took X-rays and let us go. 
  "I still had the heroin inside me when I went to the bank to 
change some money," she said. "But I was followed by a woman 
police officer with a radio. 
  "They arrested us again and said I had a problem with my 
X-ray. I admitted everything and produced the drugs. 
  "When Robert was brought into the interview room, I told him 
I had admitted it. He turned to me and said, `You admit it 
yourself. I'm not going to. You've done your job badly.'" 
  Lock, who insists there is no evidence against him, is 
expected to enter the witness box on June 24. 
  In the past his lawyer has sought to highlight alleged 
inconsistencies in Gregory's evidence. 
  He was not carrying any heroin when he was arrested as he 
checked in for a flight to Tokyo, and denied a charge of 
trafficking. 
  The court has been told that Thai customs had received a tip 
from the British Embassy to watch out for Lock, although the 
official who allegedly made the telephone call has not responded 
to a prosecution summons. 
  Speaking later from her holding cell, Gregory said she had 
found a companion in Patricia Hussain, 29, a Briton, who was 
arrested last month on drugs charges. 
  Hussain, from Manchester, is accused of possessing 7kg of 
heroin, and is also being held in the Women's Correctional 
Institution in the Thai capital. 
  "We are like chalk and cheese, but we are getting on great," 
said Gregory. 
  Lock, breaking a 15-month silence, expressed gratitude to 
people in Britain who had sent letters of support. 
  He also thanked the organisation Prisoners Abroad for 
sending 
him &pound;25 a month for food. "The food they give us is 
inedible," he said. "It has cockroaches in it sometimes. I have 
to buy everything I eat." 
  He receives the equivalent of &pound;15 a year for working 
in 
the prison timberyard. Gregory works at the bakery.

<F P=106> [Article by Marianne Curphey: "Big Rise in Couriers Arrested </F>
in France"] 
  [Text] Although arrests in Thailand attract the most 
publicity, the big increase in Britons jailed overseas is in 
France, according to the charity Prisoners Abroad. 
  The number of people held in France has risen by almost 70 
per cent since the start of the year, and the London-based 
charity now has 300 cases on its books out of a worldwide total 
of 1,000. 
  Almost 90 per cent of arrests in France are for 
drugs-related 
offences and traffickers face up to 30 years in jail under still 
sentencing laws introduced two months ago. 
  In Thailand last week, another name was added to the list of 
British detainees when Jonathan Wheeler, 34, from Hythe, Kent, 
was arrested on heroin smuggling charges at Bangkok Airport. 
  The Foreign Office says 3,000 Britons are locked up or have 
been charged across the world. Prisoners Abroad estimates that 
five years ago the number was about 1,500. 
  A spokesman said: "The death penalty exists for smuggling 
drugs in Mauritius, China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand, and 
India has a mandatory sentence of ten years in jail for 
possessing anything over half a gram of hashish." 
  However, France has seen such a big increase that a case 
worker, Duro Olowu, has been appointed solely to handle cases 
there for the charity. He said: "Under the new sentencing 
guidelines, anyone caught with 25 kilos of cannabis could be 
jailed for six years. Drug conviction also earns prisoners a 
fine of up to &pound;120,000 which can add two years to a 
sentence 
if unpaid. 
  "The relaxation of border controls had been followed by more 
vigilance among the police, so that people are not just being 
caught at the borders but throughout the country. 
  "Arrests in Thailand always grab the headlines because those 
found guilty face the death sentence and the prisons are 
perceived as hell-holes. But even in Europe prison is not an 
enviable experience. Families are split up and women are left in 
Britain trying to bring up children on income support." 
  Mr Olowu added: "Many of the people caught are small-time 
couriers with little real idea of what they are doing."

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Belyasko, chief of the Federal </F>
Counterintelligence Services' Economic Counterintelligence 
Department, by Valeriy Klebanova, in Novgorod, date not given, 
under the rubric "The Power Structures at Local Level": 
"Novgorod on the Drug Traffickers' Map"--first paragraph is 
introduction] 
  [Text] In the past six months the Novgorod City Court has 
examined a number of criminal cases pertaining to the storage, 
movement, and distribution of narcotic substances. The Federal 
Counterintelligence Service's regional administration is 
spearheading the operation to expose the channels whereby this 
"commodity," which is new to Novgorod, gets into the area. Our 
correspondent interviewed Vladimir Belyasko, chief of the 
Economic Counterintelligence Department. 
  Klebanova: Vladimir Mikhyalovich, this is the 
second time that Novgorod has become a member of the Hanseatic 
League [sentence as published]. Does it not seem to you that 
this renown will be augmented by another kind of fame--the 
region will appear on the sinister maps of the international 
drugs business? 
  Belyaskoz: The illegal international circulation 
of narcotics has become a real real problem recently. According 
to our forecasts there is a danger that in the near future 
Novgorod Oblast could become a major transit point for drugs 
dealers. There is no actual large scale market for sales 
yet--the number of drug addicts numbers a little over 100. Thus 
the main danger is the smuggling of narcotics via Novgorod from 
and into Russia. That is what the evidence of the past two to 
three years suggests. 
  Klebanova: Is this connected with the arrival of 
refugees and migrants, who bring with them not just their own 
culture but also vices previously unknown to the inhabitants of 
central Russia? 
  Belyasko: Partly yes. But the oblast's 
geographical position--its proximity to Moscow and St. 
Petersburg and the countries of the Baltic--is far more 
attractive to criminal structures. In addition, the influx of 
foreign tourists and business people is growing. Field reports 
that are coming in show that some of the latter are involved in 
the drugs business. Unfortunately, migrants from the southern 
republics and Central Asia, to whom the Novgorod region has 
hospitably thrown open its doors, are making their own 
unfortunate contribution here, too. A. Proskuryakov has been 
convicted of distributing 32 kg of marijuana while the Filippov 
brothers have been imprisoned for possession of opium. Until 
now these drugs have been produced from growing plants but there 
is information to suggest that synthetic narcotics could appear 
in the future. 
  Klebanova: What are the supply routes for this 
"commodity"? 
  Belyasko: The means and contrivances vary, from 
the traditional method of the courier to methods that are 
utterly brazen. The "commodity" is simply sent in packages 
through the post to various addresses in Novgorod. 
  Klebanova: Is it possible to draw the conclusion 
that there are permanent channels and "professionals" already 
operating in the oblast? 
  Belyasko: No specific stable groups have been 
exposed yet but their signs are there. The growth of foreign 
economic ties makes possible the expansion of contacts and in 
addition to the "traditional" smuggling of raw materials and 
weapons the illegal shipment of narcotics across the border 
cannot be ruled out either. After all, it has to be borne in 
mind that the drugs business means the "laundering" of very 
large sums of money and prices for drugs are rising all the time. 
  Klebanova: Vladimir Mikhaylovich, several large 
"foreign" diasporas have now formed in our country. Can you 
tell us who is the main bearer of this evil which is assailing 
the Novgorod region? I do not think that we will offend 
anyone's national dignity in this instance because such 
criminals violate not only state laws but also human and divine 
laws. Not just those of the Novgorod region... 
  Belyasko: Unfortunately there have been cases in 
which local inhabitants have also become embroiled in this 
"dirty business." But in the main it is the Azerbaijanis who are 
involved in the drugs business. Last year joint operations were 
carried out with the relevant agencies from Kazakhstan and 
Uzbekistan. The fact is that the campaign against the narcotics 
trade will not succeed on one territory alone and for that 
reason the special services of all states have an interest in 
exposing, preventing, and thwarting the illegal circulation of 
drugs. 
  Klebanova: Workers of the law enforcement agencies 
often attribute the ineffectiveness of the fight against the 
spread of the contagion to the absence of the necessary 
legislative base... 
  Belyasko: In this case we have the necessary 
articles of the law covering the whole range of the problem. 
But if you take into account that Russia is as yet not 
assimilated into the international drugs market you can see that 
preemptive legislation is needed. This work is already in hand 
and professional conferences are being held at various levels 
where the long-term is also discussed. But it is necessary to 
strengthen cooperation with the special services in the West, 
which have great experience in this field. International 
agreements and massive joint actions are also needed. [Belyasko 
ends] 
  The theme of the interview with Vladimir Belyasko was not a 
happy one. But I must admit that after the conversation with 
this worker from the "secret front line," I was not left with a 
sense of overwhelming despair, as is often the case. 
Nevertheless, it is a good thing that we have an agency which 
is not only fighting the onset of this ever-expanding evil but 
is also considering possible ways in which the latter might 
launch its attack and the prospects for repulsing it. So 
perhaps we will not have to drain this bitter cup of narcotics 
to the very bottom. Perhaps it will pass us by.

"Shosse Entuziastov Leads to Drugs Den"] 
  [Text] The "laboratory" where the narcotics were 
manufactured ceased operations after the arrival there of staff 
from the Balashikha Internal Affairs Directorate. It was housed 
in an apartment in a block on the Shosse Entuziastov. 
  In the apartment they discovered eight kg of poppy stems, 
several liters of solution, a large quantity of syringes, and 
all kinds of devices for boiling, roasting, pounding, and 
grinding the material. They also found several batches ready 
for use. When the agents saw these things they decided to set 
up an ambush and waited in the apartment. 
  A few minutes later a young man from the Caucasus region 
entered the apartment. He was carrying 20 kg of poppy stems and 
1.5 liters of solution. He and the owner of the apartment, a 
23-year old local man, were taken to a remand center. Many 
local youngsters may have used the services of the drugs 
laboratory. An investigation is being carried out.

  [Text] Russian customs authorities discovered a large 
amount of narcotics, worth about 25 thousand USD, in 
St.Petersburg-Tallinn train Friday morning.

  [Editorial Report] Minsk Radio Minsk Network in Belarusian 
at 1000 GMT on 5 June on the armed forces radio program carries 
an interview with Lieutenant General Yawgen Bacharow, head of 
the border guards. The resolution on the border guards was 
passed in September 1991, almost three years ago. Bacharow, 
speaking in Russian says: 
  "The number of border guards has more than doubled since 
then. New formations and units have been created to carry out 
tasks in a new direction. The border guards acquired their own 
air force, which considerably raised the mobility and improved 
the manoeuvring potential of formations and units. The guards 
also changed in quality. Formations started appearing that were 
almost totally based on professional staffing. In this short 
period of time a material and social basis was created, which 
made it possible not in words, but in deeds, to tackle 
independently all of the tasks facing us." 
  Bacharow continued: "The guards are sufficiently equipped 
with up-to-date weapons and hardware. We have good relations 
with the border guards of neighboring states: Russia, Ukraine 
Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland. We are establishing relations 
with border guards in Germany and France. This is natural, for 
it is possible to solve the whole complex of border guard tasks 
properly today only with full mutual understanding and concise 
interaction of all services within this or that state and deep 
integration of analogous processes in all Europe." 
  Bacharow says: "A few words about the operational situation. 
Today it is more complex than ever. Such negative phenomena as 
the drugs, illegal immigration, and weapons trading have moved 
to the number one spot. Although the border guards do not have 
a direct link with any of them, during everyday life and 
activity they constantly come up against them. The following 
figures show that the situation is become more complicated. 
During six months in 1993, 396 violaters of the state border 
were detained. Five months into 1994 the number is already 948, 
including over 200 detained according to information from the 
departmental service of active measures or by the service 
itself. Since its creation, this service--which is understaffed 
by 50 percent--is operating at the level of a good combat border 
detachment, although it has about 20 times less personnel. It 
has been proved possible to violate our republic's frontier with 
impunity. We make no secret of this. During six months in 1993 
there were five cases. In 1994 there was only one case. 
Seventeen criminal cases resulted from violations of the state 
frontier. In 1993 there were only two criminal cases. Of these 
17 cases, seven were organizers from the new legislation passed 
by the Supreme Soviet. In 1993 contraband worth 0.8 billion 
rubles was confiscated; in 1994 the amount was 11.5 billion. In 
1993 170 weapons were confiscated, and in 1994 the figure was 
286. In 1993 123 tonnes of nonferrous metals and in 1994 248 
tonnes were confiscated. Narcotics: In 1993, 17.3 kg were 
confiscated, and in 1994 over 80 kg were confiscated. Border 
guards received hard currency amounting to over $780,000 from 
fees for detention and for visas. If all of this is converted 
into Belarusian rubles, in five months the border guards 
themselves paid 50 percent of their annual budget. We hope that 
by the end of this year, as in 1993, we will pay the entire 100 
percent of our annual budget ourselves." [sentence as heard] 
  Having stressed the difficulties of the job, Bacharow went 
on 
to say: "The fight against illegal immigration is the top 
priority because it is the source of all evils today. We do 
have the necessary legislative basis, but it has to be 
perfected. As commander and as a member of parliament, I am 
particularly concerned by the fact that the drugs business is 
moving to a qualitatively new basis. I am consciously making 
this statement; yes indeed, to a qualitatively new basis. Until 
now the republic was only a transshipment base, but there are 
now incidents that confirm that the republic is becoming a 
market for drug sales. This is a very dangerous point, a very 
dangerous sign. We were forced to fight the drugs business 
before now, but even today it is not too late. In the very near 
future a joint group must be created, a joint department, 
perhaps a joint administration of the KGB, MVD, border guards, 
and customs to deal with this issue directly. So far, our 
efforts are at the level of the stone age."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>
  [Text] Alma Ata [Almaty] June 9 TASS -- A large-scale 
operation to spot and destroy illegally planted crops of 
narcotic plants was launched in Kazakhstan. The operation, to 
last till November 30, involves thousands of staffers of the 
interior minister in virtually all regions of the country. 
  Special attention is given to putting a stop to the delivery 
of the narcotics from the Chuya Valley. According to the 
information published in the latest issue of the Kazakhstan 
weekly PANORAMA with a reference to an official of the 
Kazakhstan Interior Ministry, about 5,000 tonnes of marijuana is 
manufactured every year out of hemp grown in the Chuya valley. 
These narcotics then spread all over the world via Russia and 
Kazakhstan's southern borders. In addition, Kazakhstan was 
being turned of late into a link for narcotics traffic via China 
from the so-called golden triangle to Europe. 
  Kazakhstan law enforcement bodies expect the hunting of 
narcotics producers and narcotics dealers to be effective. Some 
850 illegally planted plots of narcotic crops have been found 
and destroyed during such operations last year. Over 27 tonnes 
of marijuana and 16.5 tonnes of poppy straw were prevented from 
entering trafficking. Also some 12 tonnes of narcotics were 
apprehended. Their total value at black market prices of the 
Kazakh capital make up about 6.3 million U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 9/6/1994 -- About 12,000 
patients are currently under the observation of the Chisinau 
City Narcotics Department, their number increasing at a rate of 
70 percent per year, declared at a session of the Mayor's Office 
Vasile Galearschi, chief of the city Department for Health Care, 
cited the newspaper CURIERUL DE SEARA. A similar 70-percent 
increase, compared to the first three months of last year was 
registered in the number of cases concerning patients suffering 
from drug-related psychoses. Over the past three years the 
number of cases of drug and other toxic substances addiction has 
risen 2.9 times. Galearschi specified that the City Narcotics 
Department cannot work at its full capacity because of its 
disastrous material situation, in the absence of a specialized 
narcotics unit. According to a decision of the Chisinau Mayor's 
Office, the program of social-economic development for Chisinau 
stipulates the construction of a narcotics unit in 1995, stated 
the cited source.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Kirillov under the "Crime" rubric: "The </F>
`Carpathian Poppy' Is in Full Flower"] 
  [Text] Drug abuse and illegal drug trafficking are 
becoming increasingly widespread in Ukraine. Special research 
conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs shows that there 
are now approximately 400,000 users of narcotics in the state. 
  Over the past year staffers of the West Ukrainian Internal 
Affairs Transport Administration alone, who serve the Lvov 
Railroad, have exposed 874 cases of the acquisition, keeping, 
and transportation of narcotics and have instituted criminal 
proceedings against 656 people and administrative proceedings 
against 160. Of the 7.5 tonnes of raw drugs confiscated on 
Ukraine's railroads, the Lvov main line has accounted for almost 
three tonnes. Operational workers have established 30 sources 
of drug sales. 
  More than one tonne of poppy straw has already been 
confiscated in 1994, and many possessors of raw drugs have been 
exposed and arrested. "Carpathian poppies" are brought mainly 
into Ukraine's Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kherson, Nikolayev, and 
Lugansk Oblasts and also into the Caucasus. 
  Great anxiety is occasioned by the fact that drug dealers 
have started working according to the "team method." More than 
70 such groups have already been arrested. The 
arrestees--mainly unemployed young people under the age of 
35--include over 100 with previous convictions and also 92 who 
are citizens of other states.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 11 Jun (EFE) -- The 
Ibero-American countries yesterday committed themselves in 
Cartagena to step up measures to control and oversee the 
production, marketing, and possession of chemicals used to 
process drugs. 
  Justice ministers and judicial authorities meeting in 
Cartagena de Indias announced that they will reinforce 
surveillance operations at port, aerial, and ground terminals 
and will register all producers of basic chemicals to prevent 
their use by drug trafficking rings. 
  The "final document," which was signed in this city in the 
Colombian-Caribbean region, contains the main recommendations 
made to the governments. Its authors think that it is necessary 
to keep track of the chemicals and for its importers to confirm 
their final destination. Products such as caustic soda and 
ether, among others, are indispensable for the production of 
drugs such as cocaine and heroin. 
  As for money "laundering," the ministers reaffirmed the 
advisability of introducing in the legislation of Ibero-American 
countries provisions to facilitate investigations regarding the 
origin of capital when there are signs that they are the product 
of illegal drug trafficking. It also recommends cooperation 
systems to allow measures to follow up on such capital and the 
adoption of measures to intervene and, should it be necessary, 
to seize them. 
  Among the "document's" recommendations is one forcing 
financial institutions to identify their clients when 
establishing business relations and to file documents on all 
transactions for five years. They would have to advise the 
authorities should there be signs of possible "laundering." The 
meeting participants also recommended the drafting of a fiscal 
and banking cooperation agreement against capital "laundering" 
networks and the establishment of adequate procedures for 
internal controls and communications. 
  The "final document" of the 10th Conference of Justice 
Ministers of Ibero-America also recommended increased judicial 
cooperation among the countries. They agreed to establish a 
technical commission of experts to conduct a study on judicial 
cooperation and to propose ways to update and modify existing 
regulations. 
  Finally, the ministers called for the adoption of effective 
measures to protect human rights and suggested appointing in 
each country a "people's lawyer" or "ombudsman," who is 
independent of political authorities.

  [Text] Latin American narcotics chiefs agreed to create an 
organization to fight the scourge of drug trafficking, which is 
increasingly more interconnected with another illegal business: 
gunrunning from Europe to Latin America. The decision was 
adopted at a meeting in the Dominican Republic. Here is a 
report by Chelo Garcia: [begin recording] 
  Garcia: There is concern that the ties between 
Latin American drug traffickers and gunrunners are increasingly 
getting closer. They work in teams and support each other. 
Sophisticated long- and short-range weapons of every caliber, 
mostly from Europe, are flooding the Latin American black 
markets. The narcotics chiefs of Latin America decided to make 
efforts to break this deadly alliance during the drug summit 
held in the Dominican Republic. 
  Colombian counternarcotics chief Colonel Leonardo 
Gallego: The most important things were the plans for new 
methods and means to strengthen this struggle against drug 
trafficking. 
  Garcia: It was also proposed at the drug summit 
that the Latin American countries form a single bloc of support 
to control drug cultivation, production, processing, and 
trafficking. They will also work shoulder to shoulder to 
prevent the use of aircraft, vessels, and ground transportation 
to supply materials that Latin American drug traffickers need to 
produce drugs. [end recording]

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 9 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Gabriel de 
Vega, director of the Colombian National Drug Directorate, today 
said international cooperation in the struggle against drug 
trafficking has been hindered by double standards in some 
drug-consuming countries. The official, who is attending the 
10th Conference of Ibero-American Justice Ministers that began 
yesterday in this resort city, accused the industrialized 
countries of lacking the political will to fight powerful drug 
cartels. 
  "The struggle against drug trafficking has not failed. The 
truth of the matter is that many countries have not even started 
waging the battle," the Colombian delegate said, adding, "in 
terms of the fight against drugs, many contributed their noses 
and pockets, and we contributed the dead." 
  In the late eighties the now decimated Medellin Cartel waged 
a war against the Colombian Government to protest the 
extradition of Colombians to the United States. This war 
resulted in the deaths of more than 1,000 politicians, judges, 
civilians, and policemen. 
  In an interview with NOTIMEX, the director of the National 
Drug Directorate said: "Countries become sensitive to this 
matter when they experience the crude reality of this problem. 
Countries like Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia have 
experienced this situation." 
  "This situation," the official added, "has led us to have a 
political will, at least a clearer and firmer political will." 
  After accusing the consuming countries of practicing "double 
standards" in the struggle against organized crime, De Vega 
said, "Many of them sell huge amounts of chemicals that are 
needed to produce drugs, while at the same time they are 
demanding stronger counternarcotics measures." 
  The justice minister's conference, which ends tomorrow, is 
reviewing ways to control money laundering and to strengthen 
cooperation in the areas of legislation and information exchange 
in the hope of speeding up the integration of the judicial 
systems of the region. 
  The Colombian official said he trusts that the conference 
will support the host country's proposals for measures to 
control money laundering and the signing of multilateral 
agreements for judicial assistance and the exchange of evidence 
among the nations of the hemisphere. De Vega recalled that the 
strong blows dealt to the drug cartel's financial network over 
the past two years in the United States and Europe were 
recommended by Colombia. 
  Ricardo Franco Guzman, Mexican deputy attorney general, on 
Wednesday said his government supports the Ibero-American 
efforts to jointly confront crime and the illegal traffic of 
drugs. Franco Guzman said Mexico is interested in attending 
international meetings designed to find efficient ways to help 
Ibero-American justice. 
  Interviewed at the inauguration of the conference in 
Cartagena de Indias, Franco Guzman said he believes the exchange 
of judicial experience and information among the countries of 
the region is good. He added that his country will soon sign an 
agreement for the exchange of prisoners with Colombia--an 
agreement similar to the one it has with the United States and 
Panama.

<F P=106> [Article by Gerardo Albarran de Alba] </F>
  [Excerpts] According to the former attorney general of the 
republic and current Mexican ambassador to France, Ignacio 
Morales Lechuga, the increase "in violence, killing, and drug 
trafficking" in Baja California [BC] "is partly explained by a 
very close relative" of Governor Ernesto Ruffo. In a telephone 
interview, Morales Lechuga remarks: "It is obvious that the Baja 
California authorities have been protecting the Arellano Felix 
group since November 1992." 
  He adds: "The incidents in Tijuana are hard evidence. 
Neither 
the Attorney General's Office [PGR] nor Baja California society 
has any further doubt that the state justice system is 
responsible for the protection given to drug traffickers, and 
for the wave of violence associated with that phenomenon." 
  Just days before the arrest of the Baja California state 
deputy attorney general, Sergio Ortiz Lara, Morales Lechuga gave 
his version of the relationship between the Baja California 
government and the Attorney General's Office while he headed 
that department. 
  From the beginning of his administration, the drug 
trafficking problem has hounded Ruffo, who even told Lechuga 
confidentially that "certain persons had approached his family. 
He did not say much, but referred to drug traffickers. He told 
me this incidentally, in a casual manner, while waiting for a 
hearing. He never made any further comment about it." [passage 
omitted] 
  Lechuga gave his own account: "It is public knowledge that, 
during the investigation of the incidents that occurred at a 
discotheque in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, credentials in the 
names of drug dealers were found, accrediting them as Baja 
California Judicial Police agents. This was officially reported 
to that state's attorney general and governor (there is even a 
specific report in the respective preliminary investigation), so 
that the authenticity of those credentials and, particularly, 
how they were obtained, could be investigated. No results of the 
investigation have yet been published. Of course, if there is a 
culpable default, it will have to be established based on the 
previous data that have been reported nationally. 
  "Furthermore, the Baja California governor would have to be 
asked whether he is familiar with Article 120 of the 
Constitution, because that regulation requires the local 
executive branch to ensure compliance with federal laws. In 
other words, if he knew of the existence of violations or 
crimes, he should have acted, and not merely given notice. He is 
the responsible official elected by the population for that 
purpose, and is answerable to the nation for anything that 
occurs in his state's territory. We officials do our duty with 
acts and results, and not with alleged charges and reports. 
  "All of us, including the aforementioned governor and the 
Baja California population, would fully agree that the violence, 
killing, and drug trafficking have increased since his 
government took office. Part of the explanation lies with a 
close relative of the state's chief executive." [passage omitted] 
  According to Morales Lechuga, Ruffo "minimized or 
underestimated the state's serious insecurity problem. His 
explanation always was that the drug traffic was a federal 
responsibility. 
  "The governor acted contrary to Article 120 of the 
Constitution, which not only authorizes, but obliges Mr. Ruffo 
to relinquish his pretense, so as to fight and take action 
against the drug traffic." [passage omitted] 
  "Governor Ruffo never provided us with evidence or proof 
regarding murders connected with the drug traffic. I would be 
satisfied if he had explained to me the origin of his Judicial 
Police credentials, and the way in which those drug traffickers, 
later killed in Puerto Vallarta, obtained them. 
  "We are striving to counteract antisocial behavior, not 
against the governor, nor on behalf of anyone in particular." 
[passage omitted] 
  PROCESO: Governor Ruffo also complained that the 
Federal Judicial Police were involved in the drug traffic and in 
the disappearance of the existing information. 
  Lechuga: I made that statement publicly and 
privately. I told him several times: Any PGR public servant who 
commits violations of the law should be the object or subject of 
the pertinent legal procedure. The fact that one holds a federal 
position is no license for impunity, nor for undermining the 
power of the local authorities. I asked that of all the 
governors: that they not be permissive, just as I was not. Do 
you know how many remands we made to courts for crimes of PGR 
public servants? 
  PROCESO: No, I do not know. 
  Lechuga: It was 376, between 1 June 1991 and 31 
December 1992. We remanded 258 Federal Judicial Police agents, 
26 commanders, 34 group chiefs, 34 agents of the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office, and 24 civil servants from other PGR areas. 
<H5>  Ruffo Should Be Investigated: Clark Alfaro </H5>
  Moreover, the Binational Human Rights Center (CBDH) 
petitioned the Baja California Congress (for the second time in 
less than three months) to investigate Governor Ruffo and the 
state's now ex-attorney general, Juan Francisco Franco Rios, 
"for concealing and tolerating the drug traffic." 
  According to Victor Clark Alfaro, director of the CBDH (a 
nongovernmental agency in Tijuana), the petition is based "on 
its own investigations, on meetings with high-ranking officials 
of the Attorney General's Office, and on investigations 
3355/DGM93 and 540/94, opened by the PGR." 
  On 9 March, the CBDH petitioned the local congress for the 
first time to investigate the governor and the then still state 
attorney general. Ruffo's investigation was requested "for 
acting irresponsibly, concealing information, and not taking 
appropriate action"; and Franco's, for the confrontation between 
State Judicial agents under his command and Federal Judicial 
agents, on 3 March, in Tijuana. 
  Now, with the arrest of Deputy Attorney General Ortiz Lara, 
the CBDH claims to be "encouraged to see the PGR finally 
deciding to intervene in the matter with two investigations. For 
the first of them, at least, it has all the evidence at hand for 
taking appropriate action against Ruffo's officials." 
  It admits that this move is being made "in a highly 
dangerous 
environment, with politico-electoral connotations, because 
anything associated with corruption in Baja California assumes a 
different dimension, since it has the first PAN [National Action 
Party] government in the country.... Until yesterday, that had 
deterred the PGR from acting."

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Turks Control Heroin Trade"] </F>
  [Text] Wiesbaden -- Members of extremist organizations 
banned in Germany are suspected of not only being involved in 
the political underground in Germany, but also in international 
heroin deals, Klaus Juergen Timm, chief of the Criminal Office 
of the land of Hesse, told DIE WELT. Members of the Turkish 
right-wing extremist organization Green Wolves and of the 
militant Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] have been identified in 
this connection. 
  Turkish nationals are unquestioned market leaders in heroin 
dealings. The dealers who are linked mainly to Turkish-Kurdish 
drug organizations have also expanded their domination. 
According to the Criminal Office of Hesse, in 1993 Turks 
already formed 32.3 percent of all those suspected of being 
involved in the organized drug trade and drug smuggling. 
  Timm is convinced that "conspiratorial PKK command and 
communications structures" continue to exist even though they 
have been outlawed. Internationally coordinated activities are 
still possible. "The PKK must be considered an organization 
that is not only responsible for massive violent activity on 
German soil, but also deals harshly with its own people who 
break the rules, and does not shy from assassination," says 
Timm. "There is also evidence that the PKK is collecting money 
from Kurds living in Germany, and in large quantities. Whoever 
fails to donate willingly is compelled to donate, even with the 
use of force." 
  In addition, the PKK is being investigated for blackmail. 
Timm: "The problem is that we do not have witnesses who could 
confirm the criminal nature of the money-gathering activity. 
This is because the PKK places witnesses under pressure and is 
not afraid to use violence. One cannot normally investigate 
illegal financial dealings on the basis of acquired receipts 
alone."

  [Text] Belem, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Peru recommended today at the 
plenum of the 24th OAS General Assembly that a link be 
established between human rights, terrorism, and drug 
trafficking. 
  Alejandro Leon Pazos, the Peruvian permanent OAS 
representative, suggested that a new chapter of international 
provisions on human rights take into account the true intensity 
of the violence generated by terrorism and drug trafficking. 
  Leon stated that effective international measures of 
condemnation should be adopted, and the appropriate sanctions 
meted out to offenders, in order to eradicate terrorism and drug 
trafficking. 
  The Peruvian delegate today addressed the delegates from the 
34 OAS member states who are meeting this week in the Brazilian 
Amazonian city of Belem, in Para State. 
  Leon noted that the recent Vienna Conference on Human Rights 
regarded the various forms and manifestations of terrorist acts, 
methods, and practices, as well as the nefarious ties existing 
between terrorist agents and drug trafficking, as activities 
aimed at destroying human rights, fundamental freedoms, and 
democracy; and as activities that threaten the territorial 
integrity and security of all states. 
  Leon added: "The international community must urgently 
strengthen the indispensable cooperation measures aimed at both 
preventing and fighting terrorism." 
  He added that the OAS "must clearly condemn terrorism as a 
form of human right violation that affects our peoples, and 
consequently it must act immediately and effectively to stop 
this criminal scourge, instead of limiting ourselves to watching 
the tragic consequences it brings to our nations." 
  The Peruvian Government is waging a war against Shining Path 
terrorist guerrillas and to this end has adopted the death 
penalty, thus violating an OAS convention.

  [Text] Federal Police arrested one of the three drug 
traffickers who escaped during one of the largest cocaine 
seizures in Latin America. The seven metric-ton cargo of cocaine 
was seized on 5 June in Tocantins State. It was on its way to 
Santos Port. 
  Federal Police had been patrolling a 750-hectare area in 
Tocantins State for some time. The drug traffickers established 
a post to receive and pack the drug sent by the Cali cartel that 
entered the country through Rondonia State. 
  On 5 June, Federal Police stopped the trucks along the 
Belem-Brasilia highway. They were heading for Santos Port, from 
where the drug was going to be shipped to the United States. The 
drug packages were hidden among tobacco leaves. The chemical 
tests conducted on the spot immediately confirmed that the cargo 
consisted of pure cocaine. During the operation, police arrested 
seven drug traffickers. [begin recording] 
  Federal Police Director Wilson Romao: This is the 
largest connection we have ever seen here in Brazil. We are 
surprised at the system they were using: They had established a 
real shuttle service. One plane landed after the other to unload 
this cocaine. The sort of packing you have seen is very 
carefully done. [end recording] 
  Thirty police agents participated in this cocaine seizure in 
Tocantins State. There was a shootout during the operation. 
According to the Antinarcotics Division, the drug traffickers 
had U.S.-made arms, including grenades. One drug trafficker was 
injured and has been hospitalized. Three other drug traffickers 
escaped but Federal Police reported that one of them has been 
found and arrested.

  [Excerpts] The Federal Police have seized seven tonnes of 
cocaine hidden inside tobacco boxes in Tocantins State. This is 
the largest drug seizure ever made in Brazil. The operation 
began yesterday at a farm in the municipality of Guarai in 
Tocantins State. 
  The Federal Police have been closely watching this area in 
Tocantins State, where the drug traffickers own a 750 hectare 
farm whose sole purpose, according to police, is to receive 
drugs. 
  The trucks loaded with cocaine were intercepted near the 
Belem-Brasilia highway. They had been planning to travel 
directly to the port of Santos [Sao Paulo State] from where the 
drugs were to be shipped to the United States. 
  The police are surprised at the organizational level of the 
drug traffickers. The drugs were hidden inside tobacco bundles 
purchased in Rio Grande do Sul, and brought here through 
operations carried out by ghost firms. After weighing the drugs 
the police confirmed a surprising seven tonnes of cocaine. 
[passage omitted] 
  According to the police agents who commanded this operation, 
the cocaine was brought into Brazil by Colombian drug 
traffickers, to some as yet unidentified point in Rondonia 
State. From there it was flown in small Brazilian airplanes to 
their probable refueling base in the city of Alta Floresta in 
Mato Grosso State, from where the cocaine was flown to the farm 
in Guarai, Tocantins and unloaded. 
  Following a shootout at the farm, the police arrested seven 
drug traffickers. The leader, a Lebanese who had become a 
naturalized Brazilian citizen, (Nasrat Jamil Hazul), is a 
businessman from Foz do Iguacu and Paraguay. According to the 
police, the drug traffickers expected to earn a lot of money 
because they spent nearly $1 million bringing the drugs from 
Colombia. [passage omitted] 
  In making a final control of the weight of the drugs, the 
police found an additional half tonne of cocaine. This means 
that the police seized 7.5 tonnes of cocaine. The police found 
and arrested three other drug traffickers. The gang members 
confessed that last year they sent two tonnes of cocaine abroad 
using this same route. 
  The police arrested two men that were in charge of the 
bureaucratic procedures of the drug trafficking gang. All the 
documents that the gang needed were forged on the fifth floor of 
this building downtown in Sao Paulo. The Federal Police today 
arrested here forwarding agent Sergio Ricardo de Souza, who 
already had a police record for forging documents. The police 
likewise arrested business administrator (Jacques Juarez 
Minicozky). Souza was in charge of forging the bills of lading, 
while (Minicozky) had found the way to have them legalized. 
This bill of lading, for example, was made in December of last 
year, probably to cover another cocaine shipment. It was made 
in the name of the In-Out Comercial Exportadora Lta., a ghost 
company created by the two men. 
  The police also confiscated several seals and documents, 
including this passport which was to be used by the man 
responsible for receiving the drugs in the United States. 
(Minicozky) told the police he would receive $10,000 for 
forging the bill of lading and for looking after the 
bureaucratic proceedings for shipping the containers. 
(Minicozky) and Souza are under arrest for using false 
documents, and a Tocantins judge has asked for their temporary 
imprisonment.

  [Text] Guarai, Tocantins, 6 Jun (AE) -- Federal Police have 
captured 10 of the 11 drug traffickers involved in the operation 
to transport 7.3 metric tons of cocaine to the United States. 
This has been the largest seizure of drugs worldwide so far this 
year and the largest in Brazilian history. For security reasons, 
the 10 prisoners will be transferred to Brasilia on 7 June, in 
accordance with decision by Silvane Parfieniuk, acting judge of 
Guarai County Court. The prisoners were arrested after an 
intense shootout during which Colombian drug trafficker Humberto 
Vasquez was wounded. He has been hospitalized in Araguaina, 
Tocantins State. 
  Federal Police had been preparing the operation for a month, 
and were assisted by investigators from Sao Paulo, Parana, and 
Amazonas States. Police were able to arrest the drug traffickers 
and seize the 7.3 metric tons of cocaine through information 
from an informer. Federal Police Inspector Sergio Sakon said: 
"We do not have crystal balls." The cocaine was to be taken to 
Santos Port, Sao Paulo State, and then shipped to the United 
States. 
  The head of the gang--Lebanese-born Nasrat Mohamad Jamil 
Rossauz, who has Brazilian citizenship--is married and lives in 
Foz de Iguacu, where he has an electronic appliance store. Also 
arrested were Colombians Marcelo Rodrigues, Mario Alberto Graca, 
and Gilberto Wigando Scholze, as well as Brazilians Herbert 
Gouveia Barcelos, Jose David Hadad, Jill Sandro Mimikoski, and 
Carlos Henrique Barcelos. 
  Thirty Federal Police agents are chasing Colombian Vicentico 
[Vicente Wilson Rivera-Ramos], the gang's big boss. He is the 
son of drug trafficker Vicente Gonzalez Rivera, who is being 
sought by police in several countries, including Brazil. 
According to Federal Police, Vicentico still is at large and 
must be hiding somewhere in Tocantins State. 
<H5>  Operation </H5>
  The 7.3 metric tons of the drug were hidden in two trucks 
rented by the gang and concealed in the middle of a tobacco leaf 
cargo. The gang created an export company to take the tobacco to 
the United States. Federal Police, however, did not reveal the 
company's name. Inspector Sergio Sakon believes that the 
dismantling of this gang in Brazil will result in several 
arrests in the United States, Colombia, and other countries 
involved in the drug trafficking route. A consortium of 14 
processing laboratories was established to process the drug 
cargo. Sakon still does not know whether the cocaine came from 
the Cali or Medellin cartel. The drug was packed in one-kilogram 
bricks and had tags with the name of famous brands such as 
Platino, UFA, Polar, Zorro, Coca-Colo, and Professional. 
  According to estimates by policemen who participated in the 
operation, after being mixed with other products the cargo would 
yield 55 metric tons of cocaine, i.e., 55 million one-gram 
cocaine doses. On the market, the drug would be sold for a total 
of $130 million. Nasrat, however, did not want to comment on how 
much he would be paid to transport the drug. "I will only 
testify before the courts," he said. 
  The 7.3 metric tons of cocaine will be transferred to 
Brasilia on 7 June to be burned. Sakon asserted that the U.S. 
Drug Enforcement Administration did not participate in any stage 
of the operation. "The operation's success is due entirely to 
the Brazilian Federal Police," he said. In the operation, 
Federal Police also seized AR-14 rifles, machine guns, and 
grenades, in addition to a large quantity of ammunition. 
  The police questioning will take place in Brasilia. The drug 
traffickers have been arrested under Law No. 8072/90, the 
hideous crimes law. These crimes have no bail. After being 
tried, each person can be sentenced to a maximum of 30 years in 
jail. Except for Vicentico, no other member of this gang had 
been arrested previously by Brazilian police.

  [Text] Early this morning the leader of the gang that was 
transporting 7.5 metric tons [as heard] of cocaine from 
Tocantins State to Santos, Sao Paulo State, was arrested. 
Colombian Vicentico Junior [Vicente Wilson Rivera-Ramos] had 
spent two days hiding in the forest along the Tocantins River's 
banks. 
  Federal Police now are investigating the gang's links with 
international drug trafficking. The group is believed to be a 
Brazilian branch of the Cali cartel. 
  The eight Brazilians and three Colombians arrested during 
the 
operation will be transferred to Brasilia.

  [Text] The police today also arrested the largest drug 
trafficking gang in Santa Catarina State. Cocaine was brought 
in from Bolivia and taken to Rondonia State. It was then taken 
to Joinville, north of Santa Catarina State, from where it was 
distributed to several cities in Santa Catarina and Parana 
States. Santa Catarina police have been closely following every 
step of this drug trafficking gang for the past year and a half. 
During the investigations the police arrived at this estate in 
Joinville. The estate belongs to the leader of the gang, whose 
name is Lorival Pires Ribeiro, aka Juca, who was arrested 
together with his wife Gertrudes Pires Ribeiro and lawyer Luiz 
Fernando Martins. The police also arrested Juca's lover, Arcila 
Ortiz, Bolivian, on the border between Bolivia and Brazil. 
During the investigations the police identified 27 members of 
this same gang. A Joinville policeman, a member of this gang, 
is currently at large. 
  This is the largest drug trafficking gang in Santa Catarina. 
It operated for at least the past five years in this state, 
placed up to 100 kg of cocaine on the market every month, and 
distributed 500 kg of drugs this year alone. Among the evidence 
incriminating this gang, the police have recordings of the phone 
calls made from Juca's home. In the following recorded portion 
he is ordering drugs: [begin recording] 
  Juca: [words indistinct] 
  Unidentified voice: Yes? 
  Juca: Is it already all laminated? 
  Voice: No, it is not. 
  Juca: Then do it, man. [end recording] 
  In this other recording, Luiz Fernando Martins orders 
cocaine:[begin recording] 
  Martins, in progress: ...of price. We must reach 
an agreement on the price, because we must earn something and 
all that, you know. 
  Unidentified voice: I understand, yes. 
  Martins: It must be something short and sweet. 
[end recording]

  [Text] Despite the announcement that Colombia will no 
longer receive information from them, the Gringo radars in our 
country are still functioning, and it is not yet known whether 
they will be dismantled. Many questions have been raised 
concerning the issue. 
  According to a bulletin released by the Colombian Air Force, 
the order issued unilaterally on 1 May by the U.S. Defense 
Department called for the suspension of satellite transmissions 
of the information obtained from the radars at the Air Force's 
control center. There has been no mention of plans to dismantle 
the tracking equipment or to continue supplying information to 
the Gringo government. 
  A confidential source informed "AM/PM" that the radars are 
still being operated by U.S. personnel and that, in response to 
Colombia's request that the equipment be dismantled, the Defense 
Department requested a deadline of three months when the job can 
be done within a maximum of 10 days. 
  The United States has decided to stop providing Colombia 
with 
information because it believes that Colombia has violated 
several international agreements by ordering attacks on strange 
airplanes, as strange as the Gringo military airplanes that 
frequently fly over Colombian territory without permission. 
  An official decision is still expected from the two 
governments with regard to this situation, which is just another 
case of the Gaviria administration's confusing and mysterious 
international policy.

  [Text] A small airplane coming from Peru with a cargo of 
120 kg of cocaine was immobilized in the middle of a sugar cane 
field in Guavas Corregimiento, Guacari Municipality in Valle del 
Cauca, at almost midnight on 2 June. During the operation, 
troops from the Palace Battalion based in Buga detained two 
residents of Tulua and immobilized a motorcycle and tractor that 
were awaiting the shipment. The troops also confiscated five 
communications radios and a beeper from the detainees. The 
airplane, a twin-engine Seneca with registration number HK-4401, 
was en route from the Peruvian jungles to northern Valle del 
Cauca. 
  Early this morning, members of the technical corps at the 
Attorney General's Office in Cali destroyed the cocaine at the 
site of the confiscation. This is the fourth airplane loaded 
with cocaine immobilized by Valle del Cauca authorities this 
year. 
  Meanwhile, a Panamanian-flagged boat was detained at 
Buenaventura port when a shipment of 35 kg of cocaine was 
discovered aboard. The motorboat, named Ajugalucen, was en 
route to New Orleans. The boat and its 35-member crew are now 
in the custody of the District Attorney's Office in Buenaventura 
port.

Sanchez de Lozada in La Paz by reporter Jacobo Zabludovsky in 
Mexico City; from the "24 Hours" newscast--live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Zabludovsky] How has drug 
trafficking influenced or interfered in Bolivia's political life? 
  Sanchez: Drug trafficking is one of the most 
pressing problems confronting Bolivia. No one can explain why 
we do not have narcoguerrillas or cartels similar to the ones in 
Cali, for example. It is because social cohesion is very strong 
in Bolivia. Family and community ties are very strong; at any 
rate, the issue is one of concern, because we are a very fragile 
nation. Our institutions are very vulnerable, and we are 
apprehensive about this drug-trafficking issue. 
  We are struggling hard against drug trafficking and seeking 
strategies to convince the peasantry to become involved in other 
activities. It is not an easy task, because there is poverty, 
and one of the few things that produces revenue is the coca 
plant, especially when it is refined into drugs. Despite all 
this, we believe that if we can create enthusiasm for 
industrialization or an alternate economic activity, we will be 
able to find ways for the Bolivian people to abandon this 
activity. It is not an activity we are interested in promoting, 
given that it is so dangerous. 
  Undoubtedly, this is one of the greatest challenges 
confronting us, and we are all searching for solutions, not only 
the government but society as a whole, because it is undermining 
our youth. We are concerned that tomorrow it might undermine 
our stability as well as our social harmony. [passage omitted]

the U.S. Government has extended once again the deadline for 
eradicating 5,000 hectare of coca and 20,000 square meters of 
coca nurseries, this time until September 1994. 
  Quiroga explained that once the commitment is signed, 
Washington will disburse the $20 million aid for the local 
balance of payment. 
  Quiroga explained that thanks to the government 
negotiations, 
it was possible to get the U.S. to extend the deadline. 
  Quiroga recalled that once the 31 March 1994 deadline 
expired, the Bolivian Government began negotiations to have it 
extended until next September. 
  Quiroga also explained that the conditions established by 
the 
U.S. Government are not mandatory for the government. 
  He added: "We either accept the resources and carry out the 
policy or we simple don't accept it and we don't carry it out."

  [Text] Deputy Guido Camacho, chairman of the Drug 
Trafficking Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, said yesterday 
the government is "openly biased" toward U.S. interests over the 
drug enforcement policy. He demanded a new bilateral agreement 
to preserve the interests of coca farmers. 
  Camacho said it is the duty of the executive branch to 
maintain an atmosphere of peace and to meet the needs of all 
social classes of the country. 
  "I see the government is currently openly biased toward U.S. 
Government interests, thus forgetting its duty to solve the 
problems of coca farmers," Camacho said. 
  Camacho replied thus when asked about future negotiations 
between the Bolivian Government and the U.S. Embassy on drug 
enforcement once the agreement signed during the administration 
of former President Jaime Paz Zamora expires. 
  He said he believes the elimination of excess coca crops in 
the Chapare region is more of a priority for the United States 
than for Bolivia. 
  "Eradication must consider not only the exchange of money 
for 
each hectare of illegal coca. We need comprehensive solutions 
to the social problems of thousands of families in coca 
producing areas." 
  He said coca eradication must not create social or economic 
problems for large sectors of the Bolivian population. This 
depends on the government's ability to negotiate a new agreement 
for the eradication of illegal coca crops.

Mendez on the dismantling of a huge cocaine laboratory, capable 
of producing 600 kg of cocaine per month, near Puerto Pacheco by 
members of the Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN]. The 
laboratory was found on 1 June in an inaccessible area between 
two branches of the Grande river. It had separate areas to 
produce and pack cocaine. In one area the drug enforcement 
force found 12 barrels each containing 200 liters of ether and 
another 10 barrels of acetone. FELCN commander Colonel Hector 
Frias said nobody was arrested because the traffickers fled 
after being alerted by a lookout with a communications system.

  [Excerpt] La Paz, 6 Jun (JATHA) -- It was officially 
reported here today that seven Colombian drug trafficking gangs 
are attempting to control the small drug trafficking networks 
that operate in Bolivia and it is feared that they may organize 
criminal gangs to promote the proliferation of maceration pits 
and laboratories on peasants' properties. 
  This was revealed today during the opening of the first 
itinerant exhibition of "A Bolivia Free of Drugs" in which 
government officials and members of organizations that fight 
drug trafficking and abuse stressed that the people must become 
aware of the harm that this scourge causes at all levels. 
  A report made by the organizations that sponsor the 
exhibition states: "With the fall of the great Colombian drug 
cartel chiefs, their lieutenants have moved to other countries, 
in this case, Bolivia, where through violence and intimidation 
they are taking control of the drugs, thanks to the work of 
seven large Colombian gangs which control the small local gangs." 
  The report says that the presence of Colombian citizens, who 
enter the country through both legal and illegal means, is 
increasingly being detected in the Chapare region. 
  To this problem we must add the fact that the consumption of 
illegal drugs is increasing in Bolivia, a country which little 
by little is moving from a drug-producing to a drug-consuming 
country. 
  "This exhibition is about the long struggle and the efforts 
made by Bolivia to find solutions to this serious problem that 
threatens our democracy and undermines the bases of our 
society," Social Defense Under Secretary Mario Soliz stated.

  [Text] La Paz, 10 Jun (EFE) -- The Banks Superintendency, 
the Association of Bolivian Banks, and financial organizations 
have decided not to lift the bank secrecy but to implement a 
code of ethics to prevent the Bolivian banking system from 
engaging in money laundering. 
  This and other agreements were reached at the end of a 
seminar on money laundering held in La Paz, sponsored by the 
United Nations and attended by drug enforcement experts. 
  The possibility of lifting the bank secrecy was ruled out 
during the seminar and it was announced that a draft code of 
ethics for bankers would be proposed seeking to safeguard the 
credibility of the banking system. It was also announced that 
mechanisms to control illegal operations will be implemented. 
  Banks Superintendent Ramiro Cabezas explained that "bank 
secrecy as such does not exist," because the law provides for 
the supply of information at the request of a judge 
investigating alleged illegal financial operations. 
  Cabezas said the Bolivian financial system, which is not yet 
contaminated by the money laundering, is very small in 
comparison with the volume of money "laundered" or legalized in 
the rest of the world. 
  According to the United Nations, $500 billion annually are 
laundered. Some $2.2 billion are deposited in the Bolivian 
banking system. 
  Javier Zuazo, president of the Association of Bolivian 
Banks, 
explained the need to include in the new banking law some 
mechanism to identify laundering and to punish those responsible. 
  Zuazo said: "One cannot overlook the evidence. It is a 
scourge that affects all financial systems of the world," adding 
that the banks "have the duty to supply information" in cases of 
deposits of dubious origin. 
  Superintendent Cabezas recommended some measures, among them 
the setting of a ceiling for cash operations to prevent 
laundering and the need for bankers to identify their clients in 
order to protect themselves from illegal operations. 
  Bolivia is the second coca producer in the world, after 
Peru, 
and the second drug processor in the world, after Colombia, 
although experts say the benefits of this illegal trade do not 
return to this country, the poorest in the region.

  [Excerpts] La Paz, 7 Jun (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Approximately 
20,000 peasants--some 20 percent of the coca growers of the 
Cochabamba tropical region and La Paz department--today 
expressed their willingness "to replace coca with other 
products" on condition the government carries out, in the 
short-term, "effective alternative development plans" in the 
production zones. 
  Several coca growers leaders told LOS TIEMPOS that their 
unions "will do this if the Government Ministry and the Social 
Defense Secretariat" fulfill their commitments with the peasants. 
  The union leader said: "They just make promises but have 
done 
nothing to carry out the projects and works established in the 
agreements and documents signed with officials in March and May 
of this year." [passage omitted] 
  The government announced recently that at least $600 million 
has been invested in alternative development plans in the 
Chapare region of Cochabamba and the Yungas region of La Paz. 
  The official spokesmen added that only about 10 percent [as 
published] of that amount--about $100 million--has "really" been 
used in projects to replace coca. 
  The coca leaders added that most of the plans "failed, to 
the 
misfortune of the peasants and the country."

  [Text] The reign of the most wanted Rio de Janeiro drug 
trafficker ended early on the morning of 14 June with more than 
10 bullets from an AR-15 rifle at the Alemao Hill shantytown in 
Ramos District. Orlando da Conceicao, aka Orlando Jogador, who 
was known to head the trafficking in nine shantytowns in the 
outskirts of Rio de Janeiro--from Penha District to Olaria 
District--was killed together with his brother Anderson da 
Conceicao, aka Dilson, and 11 members of his gang. This is the 
bloodiest battle ever fought in the shantytowns over drug sales 
control. One Military Police agent--soldier Jose Carlos Castro 
Pontes, 31--was also killed. He is believed to have cooperated 
with Orlando Jogador in Nova Brasilia shantytown, one km from 
the Alemao Hill shantytown. 
  Jogador and his gang were surprised by members of another 
criminal gang, the Red Command, and others linked to the gang 
headed by Ernaldo Pinto Medeiros, aka Ue; Fabio Pinto Soares, 
aka Fabinho; and Marcelo Fonseca de Souza, aka Marcelo Xara. 
  The conflict began over the distribution of just over 
$27,000 
(nearly 60 million real cruzeiros) resulting from a bank hold 
up. The criminals' bodies were later found in three cars dumped 
in Sao Cristovao District, Maria da Graca District, and Barros 
Filho District. 
  The money was stolen on 13 June from the Bank of Brazil 
office in Tijuca District. Orlando Jogador, who owned an empire 
of 500 drug selling posts, rented the rifles and revolvers used 
in the hold up to the bank robbers. When the money was 
distributed, however, he deemed his cut too small. The dispute 
began when Orlando Jogador was speaking on one of his cellular 
phones with another drug trafficker--probably Ue--complaining 
about his share. The gang's cook, who was only shot in the left 
ankle, reported that the shooting then began--using the rented 
guns. 
  He told policemen of the 23d Police Precinct (in Meier 
district): Orlando Jogador was on the phone and had no time to 
defend himself.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Brazil has become the main warehouse for 
the cocaine that is consumed in the United States and Europe. 
Last week's record seizure of 7.5 metric tons of cocaine 
dispelled any remaining doubts about the key role the country 
plays in shipping the cocaine that is produced in Colombia, 
Bolivia, and Peru. In addition to distributing drugs to other 
countries, for the past four years Brazil has featured a new 
aspect in its trafficking activities that concerns police 
authorities: Brazil is producing cocaine. 
  The Federal Police [PF] believe at least two percent of 
Colombian-owned refining laboratories have been operating in 
Brazilian territory since 1990. 
  Sergio Sakon, chief of the PF Narcotics Enforcement 
Department, rules out the possibility that this percentage will 
increase in the next few years. In addition to difficulties in 
transporting the cocaine base--a coca byproduct--into Brazil, 
there are no experts in cocaine refining in the country. 
Brazilian laboratories are operated by Colombian and Bolivian 
"cooks," who attract attention in border areas and thus increase 
the risk of a police crackdown. 
  Sakon added: Furthermore, laboratories require the 
cooperation of their host communities. They can get this 
cooperation in Colombia, but not in Brazil. 
  Studies by the DEA (the U.S. drug enforcement organization) 
show, however, that U.S. military actions against the Colombian 
cartels have resulted in the laboratories being moved to safer 
ground, mainly to the Brazilian border with Colombia, Bolivia, 
and Peru. The region of Brazilian that houses the laboratories 
is identical to the areas where the main cocaine refining 
laboratories are located in the three neighboring countries: 
Tropical forest and savannas.

  [Text] A meeting is taking place at this time in Santa Fe 
de Bogota to discuss the Penal Code. Participating in the 
meeting are Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, Justice 
Minister Andres Gonzalez, and Attorney General Carlos Gustavo 
Arrieta. 
  Prosecutor General de Greiff has reappeared with firm steps. 
This time, speaking to Attorney General Arrieta, Justice 
Minister Gonzalez, and hundreds of agents of the Attorney 
General's Office, he defended the benefits of the law on 
surrender and reduction of penalties in Colombia, and questioned 
the double standards the United States has on the subject. 
[Begin recording] 
  de Greiff: The United States criticizes Colombia 
because supposedly we have very mild sentences against drug 
traffickers, especially when they surrender to justice. They 
claim that the United States has the right system, which 
consists of very tough sentences. Those high sentences are 
applied to some Colombians, but I do not know of any case in 
which U.S. drug traffickers have been sentenced for life. [end 
recording] 
  De Greiff also referred to the possible surrender of Cali 
Cartel leaders. [Begin recording] 
  de Greiff: I believe that would be their best 
choice because otherwise, the Prosecutor General's Office will 
continue its policy of pursuing them. [end recording] 
  With regard to the scandalous espionage case at the 
residence 
of Presidential Candidate Ernesto Samper, de Greiff said that 
espionage is a crime, and therefore those reports will be 
investigated. 
  De Greiff also proposed a legislative reform to regulate 
arrests in Colombia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Fidel Castano; place and date not given; </F>
first paragraph is SEMANA introduction] 
  [Text] A few days ago, through the intercession of the 
attorney who is representing Fidel Castano before the Prosecutor 
General's Office, SEMANA was able to interview the paramilitary 
commander, who is one of the country's most wanted men. Having 
secured responses to the initial questionnaire and then to some 
additional questions, SEMANA's editorial board decided to 
publish them since Castano offers many revelations about some of 
the biggest crimes in recent years. 
  SEMANA: Your hatred for the guerrillas reportedly 
stems from the murder of your father, whom the subversives 
executed after kidnapping him and after you paid a ransom. How 
did that story go? 
  Castano: My father was kidnapped in 1981 from an 
estate he owned in the municipality of Segovia (Antioquia) by 
the Fourth Front of the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia], which demanded 100 million pesos for his release. It 
was impossible to raise that amount of money at the time, 
inasmuch as our total wealth was not even half that much. 
Nevertheless, with the help of several local ranchers and a loan 
that the Amalfi Agricultural Credit Bank gave us under the 
Estate Law, we got together 30 million pesos and paid them. They 
then told me that 70 million was missing. I told them that I did 
not have that kind of money and that if I ever did, I would use 
it for nothing else but to combat them. My defiant reply was the 
reason they killed him. 
  SEMANA: Did you start forming the paramilitary 
groups in Cordova after this episode? 
  Castano: The group was actually created many years 
later. What I did right after my father's murder was to offer 
myself as a volunteer guide to the army, specifically to the 
Bombona Battalion in Puerto Berrio and the military base of the 
same battalion in Segovia. For two years, thanks to my help, as 
I told them the location of guerrilla camps and pointed out 
members of the FARC and the ELN [National Liberation Army], that 
battalion achieved excellent results in its operations. 
Concurrently, I received counterinsurgency training. 
  After that I began to realize that the methods that the army 
was using could counter the actions of the guerrilla groups but 
never exterminate them. So I decided to create my own group and 
began operating in northeastern Antioquia, the Middle Magdalena, 
as far as the department of Cordova. 
  SEMANA: What was the purpose of these groups? Who 
financed them and how? 
  Castano: At first the groups were small, just a 
few peasants who were being harmed by the guerrillas and who saw 
self-defense as a way of defending their lands from the abuses 
and atrocities committed against them and their families. In 
other words, we began our activities as self-defense and we 
later learned that the guerrillas had neither the courage nor 
the military and logistic capacity that was being attributed to 
them, inasmuch as they always avoided a direct confrontation 
with our people. It was really then that we started to deploy 
our forces and went on the offensive to cover other areas and, 
at the same time, mold our deployment to the guerrillas' area of 
influence. 
  SEMANA: But who financed them? 
  Castano: As for their financing, the self-defense 
groups have always been financed by the people who have economic 
interests in the zones in which these groups operate. 
  SEMANA: These paramilitary groups reportedly sowed 
terror in Cordova, and the authorities point to you and these 
groups as the perpetrators of the massacres in Las Tangas, La 
Negra, and Punta Coquitos. The Supreme Court recently upheld a 
20-year sentence against you in connection with these incidents. 
What actually happened? 
  Castano: ] I must regrettably acknowledge that any 
armed group in an area of conflict of one sort or another 
terrifies the civilian population. Now then, the Supreme Court 
upheld a 20-year sentence against me, but not for those 
massacres. On the contrary, I was acquitted in connection with 
them. I was convicted of conspiracy to commit a crime because I 
publicly admitted having had a self-defense group at the time of 
the demobilization, and we surrendered our weapons to the 
government. 
  What really happened was that back then there were various 
independent, uncontrolled self-defense groups, but the public 
seemed to think there was only one, mine, which they blamed for 
everything that happened in that region of the country. 
  SEMANA: What did you achieve with the paramilitary 
groups in Cordova? 
  Castano: During the time that my self-defense 
groups were in the Upper Sinu, there were no kidnappings by the 
guerrillas; land values rose; the ranchers were not paying 
protection money, and all of the cattlemen could calmly visit 
their ranches. In other words, the guerrillas were eradicated. 
  SEMANA: You are said to be a man of the world who 
travels constantly and is a major art connoisseur. Is this true? 
  Castano: I lived for three years in Paris, where I 
was in the artworks business. Before that, when circumstances 
allowed, I traveled through several countries like any other 
person who can afford to and has some taste. I do not have as 
much money as my friends have always thought; I consider myself 
an average person, a hard worker who struggles through life and 
is immersed in countless problems. But I am content and I am 
still alive. 
  SEMANA: Let's move on to another subject. Did you 
ever work with Escobar? How did you meet him? How was your 
relationship with him at the outset? Did you two ever do 
business? 
  Castano: I met Pablo Escobar in the late 1970's in 
Medellin; at the time I bought and sold cars on commission. I 
met him when I sold him several trucks, and we remained friends. 
We had certain things in common, and although it may seem odd, 
we had enormous sympathy for leftist ideology, so much so that 
on one occasion we tried to contact one of the guerrilla groups 
that existed at the time. But those leanings disappeared in him 
later when he started making a lot of money and in me when that 
guerrilla group kidnapped and later killed my father. It is 
incomprehensible to me that my eternal enemies once had my 
support. There are times when I think that if I had not had 
reason to become a counterinsurgent, I would have been a 
guerrilla. 
  I have to admit that I held Pablo in esteem back then, but 
not as greatly as I came to despise him because I never imagined 
that one day, in his obsession with money and power, he would 
become the most despicable and bloodthirsty man ever born in 
Colombia. 
  SEMANA: The authorities have fingered you as one 
of the chiefs of the military wing of the Medellin Cartel. Is 
this true? 
  Castano: I have never worked for anyone, and much 
less have I had bosses. I have not been a mercenary either. I 
have been independent and I take responsibility for my actions. 
  SEMANA: Because of that link to Escobar you have 
been cited as one of the masterminds behind the blowing up of 
the Avianca jet. The Prosecutor General's Office linked you and 
Escobar to that case and recently ordered your arrest. Were you 
involved in that bombing? 
  Castano: My war has been only with everything 
that smacks to me of the guerrillas. I do not blow up planes. I 
do not need to blow up a plane to kill someone famous. That 
reflects a lack of military resources. When you go into battle 
convinced that you are in the right and are acting with justice, 
you do not need to kill 107 people to achieve a goal. 
  SEMANA: What arguments do you have to counter the 
charges that the Prosecutor General's Office has leveled at you? 
Do you have information about the person or persons who ordered 
the bombing, who carried it out, and what their reasons were to 
kill 107 passengers? 
  Castano: It is a secret to no one that Pablo 
Escobar was the mastermind of that awful bombing. He was the 
only one who could have thought of such an insane terrorist act. 
As for who carried it out, his deputies who are now fortunately 
behind bars in La Picota Prison in Bogota can answer that. 
  SEMANA: Another of the crimes that the 
Prosecutor's Office has linked you to is the assassination of 
the former candidate of Patriotic Union, Bernardo Jaramillo 
Ossa. Last February an arrest warrant was issued for you, and 
your two brothers, Vicente and Carlos Castano, were also linked 
to the case. 
  Castano: I had a role in that, but I was not the 
mastermind, much less the perpetrator. My brothers Carlos and 
Vicente had absoluetly nothing to do with the incident or with 
any of my activities outside the law. If I had been involved in 
any way in any other activity, I would also say so, because my 
goal is to have everyone pay for what he has done. 
  SEMANA: You say that you did not kill Jaramillo. 
So who is to blame for his murder? 
  Castano: It was ordered by Gonzalo Rodriguez 
Gacha, alias "El Mexicano," and directed by Ariel Otero and men 
working for Jaime Eduardo Rueda Rocha. 
  SEMANA: But how were you involved? 
  Castano: At a meeting that "El Mexicano" organized 
I was asked for my opinion, and I agreed with the order that he 
had given to execute the operation, the details of which I did 
not know. 
  SEMANA: The courts also link you to the 
assassinations of Senator Alfonso Ospina Ospina and Father 
Sergio Restrepo. 
  Castano: As for the murder of Father Sergio 
Restrepo, I can tell you that I have never had confrontations 
with the Church or with any of its members, and if there is 
anything that I am going to fight for, it is to show that I was 
not aware of anything that happened during the time that Dr. 
Alfonso Ospina was being held prisoner. I lent armed personnel 
to retired Army Captain Elkin Henao for some operations in the 
Middle Magdalena, and he used them behind my back to look after 
Dr. Alfonso Ospina during his captivity, all this in association 
with Pablo Escobar. I am absolutely certain that the 
Prosecutor's Office will acquit me of these charges. Why should 
I deny this, given the police record I have? 
  SEMANA: What were the causes of your breakup with 
Escobar and more or less when did it happen? 
  Castano: About 15 months before he was imprisoned 
in La Catedral, Pablo gave the ELN a lot of weapons, and this 
upset me greatly. We even had a bitter argument, and I never 
spoke to him again. I felt like going after him, but the truth 
is that he scared me. During the time that he was in La 
Catedral, in fact, the Moncadas and Fernando Galeano were 
murdered, and those of us who stayed alive felt obliged to fight 
against him because we had no other choice. 
  SEMANA: Were you the founder of "Los Pepes"? 
  Castano: On 21 February 1994 I sent the 
prosecutor general of the nation a memo saying: "I would like to 
clarify to you, Mr. Prosecutor General of the Nation, that in 
order to combat the despicable Pablo Escobar and his Medellin 
Cartel and to prevent them from continuing to attack the 
Colombian people and us, whom he persecuted tirelessly, I was 
the founder of the group that called itself `Los Pepes' and, at 
the same time, its military chief. In this and in my other 
activities outside the law, my brothers were not at all 
involved, as my enemies would have people believe." 
  SEMANA: Why were "Los Pepes" established? 
  Castano: It is my understanding that "Los Pepes" 
were not established. One day, 30 million Colombians persecuted 
by Pablo Escobar simply got fed up and banded together against 
him as society's response to the absolute power acquired by 
Escobar and his deputies, whom the State has now either killed 
or put behind bars. The city of Medellin was in the hands of a 
bunch of criminals, not common criminals but insane ones who 
killed and kidnapped innocent people like never before. So, 
there had to be a strong reaction, fighting fire with fire, or 
else we were lost. I think that Medellin and the entire country 
are breathing easier now that this thousand-headed monster and 
his famous cartel are gone. 
  SEMANA: How were they organized? 
  Castano: Everybody soon realized that the prison 
called La Catedral, where Pablo Escobar and his people were 
being held, had become a bunker in which murders were being 
committed and from which orders were given to kidnap, kill, and 
blackmail industrialists, businessmen, ranchers, and affluent 
people. Several distinguished persons sought me out and asked me 
to head up a self-defense group against Pablo Escobar. I thought 
up the name "Those persecuted by Pablo Escobar." 
  SEMANA: How did "Los Pepes" operate? 
  Castano: "Los Pepes" operated on two fronts. The 
first, called intelligence, was in charge of gathering all sorts 
of information on the structure of Pablo's organization. After 
the information had been gathered, it was conveyed by telephone 
or other channels to the appropriate authorities so that they 
could take advantage of it. The other front was called the 
action front; it was an armed group that I personally headed and 
that acted on the information to neutralize and destroy the 
enemy. 
  SEMANA: How was the group financed? 
  Castano: There was no problem with that. 
Industrialists, politicians, and cattlemen contributed money. We 
also raised money and earmarked it for this cause. 
  SEMANA: Who else was part of the top brass in "Los 
Pepes"? 
  Castano: That is for the Prosecutor's Office to 
find out. I cannot be disloyal on this point. 
  SEMANA: "Los Pepes" claimed responsibility for a 
number of attacks, including the murder of Omar Canas, who 
played for the Atletico Nacional soccer team, and announced that 
other members of the team would meet the same fate. Why? 
  Castano: I am not going to be the one who 
tarnishes the image of players on that team. We have all made 
mistakes in life, and anyway they are all adults. 
  SEMANA: Why did you set fire to Pablo Escobar's 
homes, blow up his properties, and destroy his collection of 
automobiles? 
  Castano: At some point someone had to battle Pablo 
by using his own methods. Pablo planted bombs, kidnapped, and 
then murdered his friends, but not before taking away all their 
money and property. He tortured and killed hundreds of people. 
So we were not going to combat someone as insane as him by 
dropping hints. The people wanted us to destroy Pablo without 
resorting to violence, but that was not possible. If things had 
been done that way, today all of us and the government itself 
would once again be on our knees at the feet of that monster. 
  SEMANA: Why did you kill Guido Parra? 
  Castano: The Guido Parra affair was indeed a 
regrettable mistake. The operation was a hasty one. One sector 
of the organization did not handle the matter with the proper 
restraint. Unfortunately, I was away, though I am not trying to 
dodge my responsibility by saying this. But, excesses are 
committed in war too. You have to understand, though, that this 
was not done gratuitously. The operational command of "Los 
Pepes" received information that Guido Parra was in direct 
contact with Pablo Escobar and that he served as his liaison for 
intelligence work and as an adviser on hide-outs and other 
operations. We know today that Pablo Escobar himself misinformed 
us and also that Dr. Guido Parra was no longer even his lawyer 
and that they had their differences because Escobar owed him a 
lot of money in fees. So, we were victims of Escobar's ploy to 
make us look like common murderers of innocent people. This was 
another of his wartime strategies. 
  SEMANA: Why did you kill other attorneys for 
Escobar and his organization, like Salomon Lozano and Raul 
Zapata? 
  Castano: In the case of Salomon Lozano, the legal 
adviser to Carlos Mario Urquijo, alias "Arete," we found that he 
was no longer his defense attorney. Instead, he served him as a 
courier, carrying letters with false accusations and conveying 
Pablo Escobar's instructions to attack "Los Pepes" in a bid to 
wage what they called "the legal war," so that they could use 
the military, in other words, government security forces, 
against me and the organization. 
  The same was the case with Raul Zapata. In short, these 
individuals strayed beyond the bounds of their profession and 
became common criminals in service to the people who were behind 
bars, not to solve their problems but to misinform. 
  SEMANA: How did you collaborate with the Search 
Bloc in harassing Pablo Escobar? 
  Castano: We never had direct contact with the 
Search Bloc. We gave it a lot of information through various 
channels that did not identify us. 
  SEMANA: Is it true that you were involved in the 
operation in which Escobar died? In what other operations did 
you take part? 
  Castano: No. I repeat: we never had any joint 
operations with the Search Bloc. The operation in which Escobar 
died was conducted exclusively by the police, as is public 
knowledge. 
  SEMANA: What happened to "Los Pepes" after 
Escobar's death? Did they demobilize? 
  Castano: After Escobar's death there was no reason 
for our organization to continue. Since that glorious 2 December 
no more people are being persecuted by Pablo Escobar in Colombia. 
  SEMANA: Intelligence agencies report that after 
Escobar's death you had contacts with his family. Did you sign 
some sort of truce with his relatives? What are its terms? 
  Castano: I spoke with Hermilda and told her that 
we had absolutely nothing against them, and I said the same 
thing to Maria Victoria in a letter. We never regarded Pablo's 
family or the families of the other cartel members as enemies. 
  SEMANA: You demanded that Escobar's deputies who 
are in maximum-security prisons confess to all their crimes. Was 
there some sort of pact? 
  Castano: I do not consider it a pact. I simply 
thought that the members of the cartel were making a mockery of 
the Prosecutor's Office. They turned themselves in and confessed 
to a minor crime, thus eluding us and hoping to go free in one 
year. At that point we demanded that each and every one of them 
confess to all their crimes, which would guarantee them at least 
10 years in prison. That way we would not have to go after them 
again, because the Prosecutor's Office would finally be 
punishing them for their crimes. 
  SEMANA: What happened to the Medellin Cartel after 
Escobar's death? Did you take over as its leader? 
  Castano: Drug trafficking has never attracted me. 
My businesses have always revolved around ranching and art. How 
am I supposed to head up a cartel that no longer exists? How am 
I supposed to spearhead a cause that was involved in drug 
trafficking, with which I have never agreed? I must admit that I 
was a friend of drug traffickers, but only because of my 
financial dealings. The Medellin Cartel died with Pablo Escobar. 
So, there is nothing to head up in Medellin. The only thing I 
want in my future is to live in the countryside, thus assuring 
the government that I, Fidel Castano, will never again break the 
peace in Colombia. 
  SEMANA: What is your relationship with the Cali 
Cartel? Escobar always said that the Cali people and you were 
the heads of "Los Pepes." How was Cali involved in that 
organization? 
  Castano: I have no relationship with what you call 
the Cali Cartel. I do not think that the cartel exists as such. 
I do have good friends in the Cauca Valley and I am grateful to 
them because they were the ones who provided the authorities 
with the most information about Pablo Escobar's narcoterrorists. 
  SEMANA: Have you thought about turning yourself in 
to the authorities? 
  Castano: I have thought about it repeatedly. But 
the outlook would be bleak for me because I know that it would 
take longer to get me into prison than to get myself killed 
there. I have a lot of enemies in jail, and they would not waste 
this unique opportunity to murder me. I think that all things 
considered, I will try to stay alive in the countryside. I would 
rather die there than give my enemies a chance to achieve their 
goal. So, I have promised myself that I will never allow myself 
to be taken to jail. I swear it. 
  SEMANA: Is your paramilitary group still active? 
  Castano: No, I do not have a paramilitary group, 
but I do have armed personnel to protect me, because I still 
live in a mountainous area alongside the FARC, the ELN, and a 
hard core of cattle rustlers from the Popular Liberation Army 
who dream of seeing me dead. When all is said and done, as long 
as I am living in a guerrilla zone, I will never be able to let 
down my guard.

<F P=106> [Interview with Cuban Justice Minister Carlos Amat by </F>
correspondent Pedro Manuel Otero at the Hilton Hotel in 
Cartagena de Indias; date not given; from the "Evening 
Information Review" newscast--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] 
  Otero: We are here at the Hilton Hotel, which is 
the seat of the 10th conference of justice ministers. We will 
take this opportunity to speak to Cuban Justice Minister Doctor 
Carlos Amat. Dr. Amat, virtually at the close of this event, we 
would like you to tell us what fundamental topics were discussed 
and what was the fate of the proposal submitted by the Cuban 
delegation? 
  Amat: The meeting of Ibero-American justice 
ministers is a conference that has been held for several years. 
As you stated, this is the 10th conference. On this occasion 
we touched on topics that appear to be permament topics on our 
agendas. One is the topic of the fight against drug 
trafficking. This topic does not have the same implication in 
Cuba as in other countries, because our society does not engage 
in using, trafficking, or producing drugs. For other countries, 
however, it does have a serious connotation. Some of those 
countries are drug producers and are hard hit by the drug 
trafficking problem. Although we do not have this problem in 
our country, it is a very useful topic, because the experience 
of countries that are victims of this situation can always be 
learned from. They are teachings that benefit us, because Cuba 
is fighting hard to prevent drug trafficking from invading us. 
This does not mean, however, that we are immune to it or are 
exempt from it. It could happen to us. Our duty, therefore, is 
to prepare technically and to learn about the problem, to be 
able to wage an anti-drug program if necessary. There are 
isolated cases, however, involving tourists. However, it is not 
a problem that affects us to the extent it affects other 
countries. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Army Commander General Guillermo 
Paredes has said the joint patrols Honduran and Nicaraguan 
troops are conducting along the border are yielding positive 
results. The military chief has said the operation along the 
border consists of an inspection of each area, although the 
troops coincide only in certain points to coordinate actions 
against delinquents, rearmed groups, or drug traffickers. 
  He added the war on drug trafficking, which has been 
intensified in recent days, is primarily a police task, but the 
military force is present to provide support whenever necessary. 
He explained it is inadvisable to report on the border patrol 
operations, because that would alert delinquents. 
  Paredes has also said the ceremony marking the closing of 
the 
DNI [Department of National Investigation] was an appropriate 
recognition of those who devoted their lives to serving the 
fatherland. In addition, the ranking officer has said that the 
DNI had heroes who gave their lives in service of their country 
and that this was an indication of loyalty and devotion. 
Paredes has said the DNI closure is a historic event, because a 
civilian corps technical in nature will replace this institution. 
  Modern times point to new paths, Paredes has said, but we 
must be careful whenever substantial changes are made in 
organizations that are in charge of public security, because an 
error of appreciation could generate problems in the near 
future. The DNI, he added, has to be replaced by a corps with 
greater professional outreach, capable of facing the high crime 
rate that has beset the Honduran nation.

  [Text] The Attorney General's Office [PGR] has provided an 
explanation of the allegations, which have appeared in diverse 
national media, that in Ojinaga, Chihuahua, DEA agents kidnapped 
Modesto Lujan Valladares, who was taken to a penitentiary in 
Marfa, Texas. 
  1. No official of this institution has stated that DEA 
agents engaged in the alleged kidnapping of Lujan Valladares in 
Mexican territory, thereby violating national sovereignty. 
  2. It has been learned that Modesto Lujan Valladares was 
arrested on 21 April in Marfa, Texas, near the town of Presidio, 
which borders Ojinaga, Chihuahua. Lujan Valladares was found in 
a vehicle, with Victor Valle Lujan, Isidro Armendariz Morales, 
and Samuel Garcia Wilfar, ready to sell 125 pounds of marijuana 
to an undercover agent. 
  3. Nevertheless, the PGR has initiated an investigation into 
the affair, instructing its representatives in the United States 
to obtain detailed information on the case to totally clear up 
the facts for the public. 
<H5>  Regarding Sovereignty </H5>
  The unrestricted respect for sovereignty in our nation and 
the decided struggle against international crime constitute an 
irrevocable commitment, which the PGR reaffirms to guarantee the 
community's security.

  [Text] Mexico City, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican 
Attorney General's Office (PGR) announced today the arrest of 
the country's main heroin drug trafficker who is also the chief 
of a drug-trafficking band in the northern State of Chihuahua. 
  The PGR reported in a communique Rosario Pina Carrillo, 
alias 
"El Callado," was arrested 11 June based on an arrest warrant 
issued against him for crimes against health and for charges of 
planting, growing, and harvesting marijuana. 
  According to the PGR, "El Callado," also known as "El 
Huarache de Oro," operated in Sinaloa and also directed a band 
of drug traffickers in Casas Grandes, Chihuahua State, which 
borders with the United States. 
  The group, headed by Pina Carrillo, consists of brothers 
Leonardo and Roberto Pina Valenzuela, Pina Chito, and the 
Morenos, against whom arrest warrants have been issued, and they 
are also believed to have links with the band "Borunda Ponce," 
the report indicated. 
  The "Borunda Ponce" band consists of drug traffickers from 
the northern State of Sinaloa who are considered dangerous. 
  The criminal organization "Borunda Ponce" operates in Casas 
Grandes, Chihuahua. They finance the planting, transportation, 
and commercialization of narcotics, from which they make large 
profits, the source reported. 
  The PGR said Pina Carrillo's arrest will make it possible to 
arrest other drug traffickers in the near future and thus 
disarticulate both bands, something that would be a hard blow 
for the Sinaloa and Chihuahua drug cartels.

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Aranda and David Aponte] </F>
  [Text] The National Defense Secretariat [Sedena] has seized 
134,881 firearms, among rifles and handguns, so far in the past 
six years. The total number of weapons the Mexican Army and 
Navy seized reached 5,626, according to Sedena reports, during 
the first six months of 1994. 
  Of the total seized, 95 percent entered Mexican territory 
through so-called small-scale smuggling, especially through 
Chihuahua, Michoacan, Sinaloa, Jalisco, and Nayarit, reports 
indicate. 
  Meanwhile, Navy Secretary Admiral Luis Carlos Ruano Angulo 
has said the weapons the Mexican Army and Navy seized belong to 
drug traffickers, "but we have not found caches of weapons or 
anything similar." 
  Interviewed during the inauguration of the 15th Navy Health 
Medical Campaign, Ruano said the drug traffickers have economic 
resources to buy weapons, but "too much propaganda is being 
given to what you call goat horns [AK-47 submachine guns]." 
  LA JORNADA: In light of these circumstances, which 
are being denounced in the United States, isn't it necessary to 
change surveillance measures? 
  Ruano: There really is no need for that. Wherever 
weapons are being smuggled, it will be stopped. 
  According to Sedena reports, only 5 percent of the weapons 
that enter Mexico are brought in legally. Those weapons are 
given to state governments to supply their police forces, and a 
small portion winds up in the hands of civilians. 
  The cost of the weapons varies in accordance with their 
brand, caliber, condition, and use, and prices range from 
approximately 300-7,000 pesos 
  Mexican Army figures indicate that during the government of 
President Salinas de Gortari, the Armed Forces seized 54,208 
rifles and 60,673 handguns. In addition, 98,644 weapons, both 
rifles and handguns, that were seized are available to Sedena. 
  The report adds that in the first six months of 1994, Sedena 
seized 2,591 rifles and handguns, in addition to another 3,035 
that are at the disposal of civilian authorities. The Army 
seized 5,626 weapons during that period. 
  According to Army reports, most of the arsenal comes, 
presumably, from the United States, China, and the former Soviet 
Union. Reports also indicate the weapons enter the country by 
land, sea, air, and in small amounts; that is, through so-called 
small-scale smuggling. 
  Reports reveal federal organizations that receive a greater 
portion of the weapons are in Chihuahua, Michoacan, Sinaloa, 
Jalisco and Nayarit. The weapons presumably enter these states 
mostly by land and in an "organized" manner. 
  Meanwhile, Sedena makes, through its General Directorate of 
Factories, weapons under a German trademark exclusively for the 
Mexican Army. 
  Sedena stipulates the requirement a citizen must meet to 
legally buy a weapon. Requirements include that the person live 
honestly, comply with military service, and have no record of 
being sentenced for weapons use. Permits to bear weapons can 
also be obtained based on the nature of the person's occupation, 
the special circumstances of his place of residence, or any 
justifiable reasons that merit it. 
  A document in which the Mexican Army warned the Government 
Secretariat on the possible illegal entry of 20,000 AK-47 
submachine guns, better known as goat horns, was disclosed 
recently. The first shipment would reportedly consist of 2,000 
weapons of this type (rifles). 
  Sedena stated later the entry of those weapons, which would 
represent less than 20 percent of the weapons seized in the past 
six months, into Mexico has not been detected so far.

<F P=106> [Article by Patricia Cerda] </F>
  [Excerpts] The narcotics market is being reinforced because 
certain authorities are involved in the cultivation, 
trafficking, and consumption of drugs. This statement was made 
by the Mexican Bishops Conference [CEM] in a document charging 
the existence of a clandestine network fostering very close ties 
between the drug traffic, violence, and the arms trade. [passage 
omitted] 
  In the document, titled "The Drug Traffic, Pastoral Concern 
of the Church," released yesterday by the General Secretariat of 
Bishops, the church explains that the consequences of 
clandestine drug production are clearly evident, namely: 
insecurity, anxiety, violence, and family disintegration. An 
atmosphere of terror is being created, with involuntary 
emigrations, threats, and pressure. 
  It goes on to say that drugs provide fast, easy money gained 
through illegal means. This is causing a destructive change in 
the society's culture and way of thinking. Juvenile crime is 
rising, as is the loss of human lives due to murders, theft, and 
threats of revenge for those informing. 
  As a result of all this, it notes, there is increased 
corruption and a growing decline in society's moral level. 
  The document stresses that, in the regions where poppies and 
marijuana are grown, the rural production system is being upset, 
because the human and material resources that would normally be 
devoted to food production are being diverted to drug growing. 
  It emphasizes that there is a completely organized 
clandestine network for providing seed, credit, and fertilizer; 
for technically monitoring planted and fallow fields; for 
collecting and distributing all the products; and for involving 
the Indian peasants. These drug trafficking networks, and even 
the individuals engaged in this trafficking themselves, have 
acquired a strong economic, political, and social leadership in 
our towns and regions, thus reinforcing our ancestral "cacique" 
system. 
  It admits that, although the drug traffic has major 
production and distribution operations on the national 
territory, it is primarily a problem with international 
dimensions. It is in other countries, such as the United States, 
that the drug traffic's main decisionmaking centers operate, and 
the largest drug consumer market is located. 
  The document continues, claiming that very close ties 
connect 
the drug traffic with violence and arms sales; adding that those 
joining it are risking their lives and those of their families. 
"Almost every day we hear of murders, to the extent that this 
violent situation has become commonplace in some of the 
country's towns and regions." 
  And it cautions: "The extent of this problem reinforces the 
hypothesis that it would not be occurring if some authorities 
were not involved in drug cultivation, trafficking, and 
consumption. On the other hand, this hypothesis is difficult to 
prove, because of the furtiveness and cleverness of those 
associated with this phenomenon." 
  It further claims that serious injustices are often 
committed 
in the campaigns against the drug traffic and drug addiction, 
affecting mainly simple peasants, Indians, and poor people. 
Because of a small amount of drugs that they produce or carry, 
they suffer abuse and spend long periods, even years, in jail, 
while the big producers and traffickers usually enjoy impunity. 
  The document makes this depiction: "Drug consumption has 
increased day by day in recent years. It has now reached the 
rural areas, where, in the past, drugs were only produced, but 
not consumed. It has reached all ages: children, adolescents, 
and youths find themselves accosted by drug pushers in the 
schools and recreation centers. Unfortunately, very little is 
being done to prevent this." [passage omitted] 
  It adds that the impotence of the isolated groups, even the 
national ones, and the willing complicity of certain 
authorities, have caused the solution to the drug trafficking 
problem to lie in society itself. It is the authorities' duty to 
heed the community's outcry and seek legal systems, both 
national and international, to provide a timely solution to the 
problem, in response to society's just demand. 
  It does not consider the prosecution of criminals alone to 
be 
an adequate solution to such a serious problem. It also requires 
appreciation and esteem for the values that accompany and 
protect life, such as health care, wholesome recreation, family 
integration, social coexistence, citizens' participation, and 
the development of all the spiritual values, particularly those 
related to culture and religion. 
  Finally, this document encourages all groups and 
institutions 
that are promoting love for life and nature, and those striving 
to help the victims of drug addiction.

  [Text] Mexico City, 11 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican 
Secretariat of National Defense reported that various national 
institutions are conducting counternarcotics operations this 
rainy season, a time suitable for the planting of drug crops. 
  Mexican troops have conducted operations in Mexico, Sinaloa, 
Durango, Chihuahua, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Michoacan, Oaxaca, 
Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Hidalgo, Guerrero, Zacatecas, 
Aguascalientes, San Luis de Potosi, Guanajuato, Queretaro, 
Puebla, and Morelos States, according to a communique issued by 
the Secretariat this Friday. 
  In the communique, the Secretariat of Defense indicated that 
these operations were not carried out solely in Guerrero State, 
where local media reported a "massive troop presence." 
  The communique indicated that operations staged in 21 states 
on 1 June resulted in the arrest of 10 local drug traffickers, 
the destruction of 2,242 drug crops, four drug traffickers' 
camps, and a marijuana drier. 
  Officials also incinerated 323 kg of marijuana seeds, 30 kg 
of poppy seeds, and two kg of cocaine and confiscated 233

  [Text] Yesterday, with reconnaissance, inspection, and 
detection flights, the air teams from the Attorney General's 
Office [PGR] discovered two marijuana and poppy plantations in 
Baja California and Sinaloa States. Presumed drug trafficking 
groups were growing over 200,000 drug plants on these 
plantations. The confiscation of farm implements, fuel, gun 
loaders, and useful cartridges was also announced. No arrests 
were made. 
  Reports sent to Mexico City by Arturo Ochoa Palacios, the 
PGR 
representative in Baja California, state that, on the boundary 
of the communities of Real del Castillo and Viejo Enecua, in the 
municipality of Mexicali, a marijuana plantation on 
approximately 15,000 square meters was discovered. 
  Mario Ruiz Massieu, assistant attorney for local offices and 
inspection, was informed that, on that expanse, 7,500 seedbeds 
were located, each with 25 plants, ready to be transplanted to 
solid ground. Found on the site, adjoining the Ojos Negros 
highway, were picks, shovels, hoes, machetes, axes, a jug 
containing gasoline, two 22-caliber rifles, and useful 
cartridges. 
  Continuing the investigation, agents under orders from 
Rodolfo Garcia Gaxiola, the PJF [Federal Judicial Police] deputy 
commissioner, also confiscated a pickup truck with state of 
California registration 2JDE320, and a filled loader for a 7.62 
caliber rifle. These items were left at the social 
representative's disposal. 
  Moreover, Luis Antonio Ibanez Cornejo, the PGR's 
representative in Sinaloa, reported that, in the hamlet called 
Las Playitas, in the municipality of Sinaloa de Leyva, a mixed 
(marijuana and poppy) plantation was located. The 21 drug crops 
being grown there were destroyed manually and incinerated by 
federal agents. 
  It was added that the community had participated in the 
discovery of those crops, since it reported in a telephone call 
that groups of persons acting suspiciously were often meeting on 
that site. This prompted the Federal Judicial Police to 
intervene, resulting in the destruction of the illicit plants. 
  The PJF deputy commissioner in this state, Eduardo Salazar 
Carrillo, informed the force's general director, Adrian Carrera 
Fuentes, that hoes, shovels, fumigation pumps, fertilizers, and 
insecticides were also discovered and seized on that site. 
  The PGR stressed in conclusion that, in both cases, the 
investigations are being continued to identify and capture the 
crop owners, as well as those who provided their services to 
plant and produce the drugs.

  [Text] In connection with the technical cooperation 
agreements maintained by the Mexican and French Governments to 
fight drugs and crimes resulting from that social evil, the 
National Institute To Combat Drugs [INCD], now under the 
direction of Rene Paz Horta, has arranged and organized a course 
for dealing more effectively with the drug traffic. The Attorney 
General's Office [PGR] announced yesterday that the course will 
be given to Mexican federal police forces by French police 
specialists. 
  The federal institution of justice noted that the course, to 
be taught by three instructors from the French National Police 
"elite group," is titled "Updating of Intervention Techniques 
for Groups Specializing in the Drug Traffic." It is intended for 
approximately 20 agents from the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] 
counternarcotics sector, as well as 10 more from the 
interception group of the PGR's National Institute To Combat 
Drugs. 
  The PGR stressed that by offering this type of course, the 
INCD is redoubling its efforts aimed at combating drugs. It 
explained that the course, which opens today, will be held at 
the institute's headquarters and at various metropolitan police 
facilities. It includes topics relating to techniques for 
search, assistance, and intervention in fighting the drug 
traffic, as well as monitoring, surveillance, and arrests of 
dangerous criminals, and penetration of buildings and premises 
in which criminals are operating. 
  It indicated that the French specialists' program of 
activities includes the presentation of equipment and weapons 
used by the "RAID" (French National Police elite group), and of 
its organizational structure, based on activities including 
search, assistance, intervention, and deterrence of criminal 
groups. 
  In conclusion, it remarked that the course will be 
coordinated by the INCD's General Directorate for Corporate 
Development. It is to be given by Jean Marc Fata, Bernard Joly, 
and Damien Lecoq, experts in the battle against organized crime, 
under the supervision of Christophe Chadoud. The latter is 
principal commissioner of the international police technical 
cooperation service at the French Embassy in Mexico.

  [Text] Lima, 10 Jun (EFE) -- The Peruvian police confimed 
today the arrest of drug trafficker Moises Zamora, leader of the 
"Zamora Brothers" gang, which regularly supplies cocaine paste 
to the Colombian drug "cartels." 
  Zamora, aka "Uncle Mocho", was arrested on 25 May in a 
luxury 
apartment house located in the Miraflores residential 
neighborhood in Lima. His arrest was kept secret until today so 
as not to obstruct investigation proceedings. 
  Zamora had his base of operations in the jungle town of 
Uchiza. It is located in the heart of the Huallaga valley, the 
most important cocaine paste production center in the world. 
Zamora sent huge cocaine shipments from Uchiza to Colombia. 
  Zamora's arrest was possible as a result of information 
supplied by a Shining Path [SL] leader who confessed that drug 
traffickers had "donated" money and guns to the Shining Path. 
  SL Leader Alejandro Estelita, arrested in the northern town 
of Trujillo a few days before Zamora's arrest, was a member of 
the "Huallaga Regional Committee" and "coordinator" of the 
agreements reached between the SL and several Peruvian drug 
trafficking gangs. 
  Estelita confessed he was in charge of collecting funds in 
cash, food stuffs, guns, medicines, and vehicles that drug 
traffickers supplied to the SL in exchange for protecting drug 
shipments. 
  Estelita informed the police that during the last meeting 
with Zamora, the drug trafficker handed him $25,000 for the 
purchase of various supplies. Estelita added that Zamora handed 
the terrorists about $100,000 per month. 
  In addition, Zamora assisted the terrorists in finding 
hideouts and planes, to hide or flee each time the security 
forces conducted antiterrorist operations in the Huallaga valley. 
  In compliance with the Peruvian law, Zamora will be tried 
for 
terrorist crimes and sentenced to a minimum of 30 years in jail. 
This is the same sentence that was given to drug trafficker 
Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," in March. 
  Moreover, the police presented to the press a cocaine paste 
shipment of more than 500 kg, valued at $10 million that was 
found on 5 June in Vainillas-Chacra San Insidro, in the Huallaga 
valley. 
  The drug was found hidden in pits covered with excrement. 
Also found hidden in the pits were nine rifles and three 
machine guns. It is believed these guns belong to the Ecuadoran 
security forces. 
  According to the police, the shipment had been stored by a 
drug trafficker known as "Picaflor." He was supposed to deliver 
it to the drug trafficking gang led by "Lucho Culon," one of the 
Colombian cartels major cocaine suppliers.

  [Text] St. Lucia, like all the other countries in the 
region, continues to fight off the drug menace. As is 
customary, large quantities of drugs confiscated are set to the 
torch, hoping that this and the fines and imprisonment terms can 
act as a deterrent for both perpetrators and would-be felons. 
Last month, members of the Royal St. Lucia Police Force, 
accompanied by prison inmates, took a large quantity of 
confiscated drugs to the dump site and set it alight. The 
stash, comprising marijuana, cocaine, and crack, was estimated 
at over EC$250,000.

<H5>  Drive in Rural Areas To Concentrate Attack on Four Types of </H5>
Criminals 
  A member of the CCPC Central Commission on Political Science 
and Laws recently stressed that rectifying public security in 
rural areas is part and parcel of the 1994 task of improving all 
facets of public security. The department concerned will take 
"major steps" to crack down mainly on four types of criminals so 
that the public security in rural areas will be markedly 
improved within a short period. The four criminal types are: 
One, local riffraff, rural despots, hooligans, and other evil 
forces, especially robbery gangs and criminal organizations 
close to the underworld; two, train robbers, highwaymen, 
pirates, and those engaged in murder, robbery, causing 
explosions, and rape using force; three, serious criminals 
guilty of destroying railroads and telecommunications and 
production equipment or stealing state assets; and four, those 
who organize prostitution, engage in drug trafficking, abduct 
and sell women and children, defraud others of their money 
through superstition and the manufacture and distribution of 
obscene items, and who organize gambling. (Summary) (Hong Kong 
ZHONGGU TONGXUN ZHE in Chinese 0915 GMT 11 Jun 94) 
Stepped Up Antidrug Operations Reap Rewards 
  Stepped up antidrug operations since early this year have 
resulted in 2,000 solved cases, almost double the number last 
year, and the seizure of 2,000 kg of drugs. Public security 
organs in the southwest border provinces and regions, and along 
the southeast coast--Yunnan, Guangxi, Fujian, and 
Guangdong--have increased reconnaissance and border and coastal 
interceptions. Yunnan solved 900 cases in the first quarter, 
seizing over 700 kg of heroin. Guangxi and Guangdong solved over 
400 cases, arresting a number of drug traffickers from outside 
the borders. Fujian solved 22 cases, seized almost 40 kg of 
drugs, and arrested 57 suspects, some of Taiwan origin. The 
public security organs made a point of mobilizing and relying on 
the masses to launch a people's war against drugs. (Summary)

  [Text] THAN SETTHAKIT went to Khun Sa's area in the north 
and discussed many issues with him, including the future of both 
he and his followers in the Shan State. 
  "If the economy is weak, our brave soldiers probably won't 
be 
able to fight well. On the other hand, our poor-quality soldiers 
can become good fighters if the economy is strong." 
  This well-built man, who is more than 175 cm tall and who 
appears to be a very kindhearted person, talked confidently 
about his economic views. He was wearing a white, short-sleeved 
shirt and a pair of comfortable-looking long, dark trousers. 
Looking at him, it was difficult to believe that this was the 
internationally-known "heroin kingpin." In 1981, the Thai 
government offered a reward of 500,000 baht for his arrest. But 
people have said that that is a very small amount as compared 
with the value of the huge amounts of heroin that flow from the 
Golden Triangle to world markets. 
  The economic views of Khun Sa, who presently holds the 
position of president of the Shan Sate Restoration Council 
(SSRC) and head of the Mong Tai Army, are similar to the 
well-known strategy of Napoleon, who attached great importance 
to the economic well-being of the people, saying that "an army 
marches on its stomach." During the past 40 years, Khun Sa's 
forces and the other minority group national liberation 
movements in Burma have "put food in their bellies" in order to 
survive and continue the struggle against the Rangoon government 
by trafficking in opium. In particular, the Shan's struggle for 
independence has been closely tied to international narcotics 
trafficking activities, and so it has been ignored by the 
international community. This is in contrast to the struggle for 
independence that is being waged by minority groups in many 
other regions of the world, which people have monitored closely. 
This includes the struggle by the Palestinians against Israel, 
the conflict between the Serbs and the Moslems in Bosnia, the 
slaughter of the Kurds in Iraq, and the conflict between the 
whites and the blacks in South Africa. 
  As for the world in the information age, the Cold War has 
ended with the collapse of the communist states, and many 
different viewpoints have arisen. This rapidly spreading 
international trend has caused many countries to put economics 
before politics. Khun Sa cannot escape this trend. People's 
views on the Shan national liberation movement have begun to 
move to a new dimension. 
  Khun Sa has begun making preparations to deal with these 
changes. He has talked with reporters from around the world, who 
are becoming interested in the international narcotics problem 
and who are viewing Khun Sa's role in a new light, and explained 
to them why the people in the Shan State have to produce opium. 
"My people produce opium because they have to buy food and 
clothes for themselves and their families. I have never heard 
anyone say that they are growing opium poppies in order to 
destroy another nation. If we are to grow substitute crops, we 
will need roads so that we can transport our produce to market. 
But Burma has never shown any interest in building roads. The 
oranges and other fruits that we produce would rot before we 
could transport them to the markets. But in producing opium, we 
don't need any roads. The merchants come to us." 
  However, the Shan State's policy is that the "strong 
economy" 
of our independent state must not be based on "growing opium 
poppies." "Even though we cannot expect the governments of 
various countries to cooperate with us at this time, we can 
obtain cooperation from people in the private sector," said Khun 
Sa. As an example, he said that "poppy cultivation declined in 
China because China had its own government. Similarly, the 
eradication of poppy cultivation in the Shan State cannot be 
separated from the establishment of an independent Shan 
government. China's independent government (put an end to poppy 
cultivation by itself). It wasn't necessary for other 
governments to tell them that it was urgent to end poppy 
cultivation. The same is true for us." Today, Khun Sa has 
established a foundation for changing the economic structure of 
a free Shan State. 
  Traveling in this "economic base" area, we saw several 
economic projects that Khun Sa is carrying out in order to 
establish a foundation for changing the economic structure of 
the Shan State. One of the tangible projects that is quite 
interesting is the construction of a medium-sized earthen dam in 
order to store water for agricultural use. And this will be 
developed to produce electricity in the future. As for the plans 
to create new occupations for the Tai people in the Shan State, 
some very interesting steps have been taken. This includes 
planting other crops in place of opium poppies. Today, people 
are growing mushrooms using technology from Taiwan. There are 
presently seven-eight 15 X 30 meter buildings for growing 
mushrooms. An average of 100-200 kg of mushrooms are harvested 
every day. Most are sold at nearby markets at a wholesale price 
of about 50 baht per kg. Other cold-weather vegetables and 
flowers will probably be cultivated in the future, because the 
Shan State is comprised mainly of high mountains where the 
temperature is cool year round. If there is enough water, 
agriculture will probably develop rapidly. 
  Gem cutting is another occupation that Khun Sa thinks is a 
viable option for Shans. Much of the land in the Shan State is 
rich in valuable natural resources such as sapphires, rubies, 
jade, gold, amber, and so on. The Mong Tai Gem Cutting Factory 
is located near Khun Sa's beautiful house. Suradet Phandi, a 
Thai from Lopburi Province, works there as an instructor. He is 
teaching gem cutting to about 20 Shan women. For this, Khun Sa 
pays about 10,000 baht a month, which is a large sum for people 
in Ho Mong. State officials of the free Shan State are paid a 
salary of only 150 baht a month. But everyone, including 
Suradet, receives an allowance from the state for food and 
housing. Suradet is very impressed by Khun Sa and the 
friendliness of the Shan people in Ho Mong and plans to continue 
working there. 
  The textile plant, which uses technology and instructors 
from 
Sankamphaeng District, Chiang Mai Province, is diligently 
developing the skills of its workers. Even though the looms, 
which are operated by human power, are similar to those used 40 
years ago in Sankamphaeng, the people there firmly believe that 
they will achieve national independence and have a better life. 
Thus, there is no hint of discouragement or tiredness in the 
eyes of the several dozen women who work the shuttles there to 
produce beautiful cloth. 
  Peter G. Bourne, a special adviser to the president of the 
United States and the head of the Drug Abuse Policy Office in 
the Carter White House, was a senior official who played an 
important role in formulating and implementing the narcotics 
policy of the United States. Several weeks after meeting with 
Khun Sa at Ho Mong, on 6 May in a letter sent to the BANGKOK 
POST, Bourne openly admitted that "Khun Sa is a man of great 
charisma and a person worthy of respect. I and many others used 
to refer to him as a drug warlord, but that was careless of us. 
We viewed things too superficially and were unfair (to Khun Sa). 
This is evident from that fact that he has adhered to the 
agreements. He has looked for ways to win independence for the 
Shan State. He is making rapid progress in that direction by 
developing a vigorous economy in his zone of influence. I think 
that he is one of the most charismatic national leaders that I 
have ever met." 
  Besides this, Bourne feels that the time has come to begin 
negotiating openly with Khun Sa. This means admitting that the 
"struggle for Shan independence" is an important political 
problem that is at the root of survival of the minority groups 
in Burma who rely on poppy cultivation. 
  An important new turning point in the life of Khun Sa is 
becoming apparent to the people of the world. But the path ahead 
is not strewn with rose petals, because the profits to be made 
from opium, particular after it has been processed into heroin, 
are huge. The network of those who are involved and who have 
financial and political power extends around the world. It 
certainly won't be easy to put an end to this.

  [Text] There is fresh evidence that the Khun Sa group is 
very much active refining opium, producing its most deadly 
derivative, heroin, which eventually finds its way to capitals 
of countries where the perpetrator of drug-related problems 
still finds allies, for obvious reasons. 
  Acetic anhydride, the most potent of precursor chemicals in 
the refining process, was on its way in bulk toward the 
tri-border area where the rogue has his den when a lightning 
raid by the Tatmadaw sent the caravan people running for dear 
life. 
  The chemicals, in 126 plastic containers, measure over 3,333 
litres. Calculating in terms of what those familiar with the 
process say, the end product would be 3,333 kilos of pure white 
heroin. 
  Where would the miscreant despatch that much of lethal 
powder? Wherever there is demand. That is why the Government 
here is pushing for demand reduction while striking at the root. 
  The interdiction of the chemical caravan also left 62 
pack-saddles in the hands of the law-enforcers. Plain reasoning 
will help deduce that there were in the trail 62 pack 
horses/mules. 
  Knowing they must jettison their precious contraband in 
order 
to save their lives, Khun Sa's men had taken to mule-back 
riding, which they would not have done under normal 
circumstances. Moreover, they had not crossed the Thanlwin and 
were still far from where they were holed out. 
  There were earlier occasions, as divulged yesterday, when 
similar chemical contraband was seized, meaning the law 
enforcement personnel were able to deprive the refineries of the 
most essential element. 
  From time to time, opium and various other forms of opiates 
and even psychotropic substances which were seized through 
Tatmadaw and police checks were destroyed in the presence of 
local and foreign newsmen, diplomats and other guests. 
  There are times when the wholesale producer of heroin is 
portrayed as hero by the Western media. Seldom is he made a 
villain. The way we in Myanmar see it, those like him who 
perpetrate such atrocities against humanity must be villains. 
  Anyone with enough sense in his head would not bother to 
argue on his behalf. Plainly put, a drug man, and those who 
lend that person support of any measure, must be treated as 
intent on and actually doing harm to society world-wide. 
  Caught red-handed. Indicted.

  [Text] At about 6:00 this morning, the International 
Section of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation cracked a drug 
case at Li-ti Building on Taipei's Liaoning Street, seizing more 
than 100 pellets of morphine and heroin (weighing a total of 
more than 1,300 grams and worth nearly NT$100,000 [New Taiwan 
dollars]) and arresting seven Nigerian males on suspicion of 
drug trafficking. One of the suspects, named K'a-hsi-mo, was 
shot in the calf by police for resisting arrest and attempting 
to flee. The wound, however, posed no major obstacle, and after 
being bandaged in a hospital the man was bound over to the 
bureau for interrogation. 
  Police had received tips that several foreigners residing in 
the Li-ti Building, located at Number 27, Lane 63, Liaoning St, 
had smuggled narcotics into the country in order to sell them. 
So at about 6:00 this morning, an assault group comprised of 10 
officers, including six from the bureau's International Section 
and four from its rapid-strike and police-network groups went to 
the scene to investigate. 
  Upon arrival, the police found the behavior of two black 
males, K'a-hsi-mo and Hsueh-jui-k'o, who had come downstairs, to 
be suspicious and so arrested and led them back upstairs to 
ascertain whether or not they possessed drugs and to search for 
accomplices. The police first searched Apt 603, located on the 
fifth floor. It was occupied by four or five foreigners, who 
turned out not to be what the police were seeking. The police 
then led the suspects down a floor to continue the search. 
  Next searched was Apt 508, which the suspects had suggested 
was suspicious, but no one was found there. The suspects then 
indicated that 506, next door, might be the place. Thereupon, 
they were left, under guard by two officers, in 508, while the 
rest of the police went to search 506. 
  As the police entered that apartment, three black males 
inside immediately threw a plastic bag like the kind used to 
store narcotics out a window, where it landed on the balcony. 
After subduing the men, the police discovered that the bag did 
indeed contain drugs, many pellets of heroin and morphine. 
According to the initial count, there were 56 pellets of heroin, 
40 of morphine, and several of the latter loose or crumbled, 
with a total weight of 1,300-plus grams, worth nearly NT$100 
million. 
  After finding the drugs, the police led the three men, 
K'a-wen, Ao-k'u Ssu-ting, and Na-wa Ch'u-k'a, out of the 
apartment, which they then searched, discovering two more black 
men, Ya-mai-hsi and Ou-ni Pu-hsi, hiding under a bed. Including 
the first two detainees, Hsueh-jui-k'o and K'a-hsi-mo, seven 
suspects were apprehended. 
  As the police led the seven downstairs, suspect K'a-hsi-mo 
suddenly broke free and dashed downstairs. The police fired 
shots in the air to halt him, but he continued his flight. The 
police then fired at him, striking his right calf, which was 
pierced by the bullet. Even so, the suspect continued to flee, 
but the police finally subdued him after a chase of about 500 
meters. 
  The police surmised that the suspects had smuggled the drugs 
into Taiwan by swallowing them or inserting them into their 
anuses. However, the suspects denied involvement in trafficking 
and are still being questioned as of this noon. Nigerians 
reportedly now comprise a major force in international 
trafficking. In Thailand alone, nearly 800 are in prison for the 
offense. The seven suspects in this case did not have any 
passports in their possession, so efforts are still under way to 
verify their identities.

  [Text] Although Thailand has succeeded in cutting opium 
production by 99 per cent in three decades, the high output of 
2,000 tons from its neighbours still makes the Golden Triangle 
the world's largest narcotics producing region. 
  The increase in opium production in the region over the past 
20 years is due to rising demand in consumer countries in 
Europe, North America and in Australia, according to Pol Gen 
Chawalit Yotmani, secretary general of the Office of Narcotics 
Control Board (ONCB). 
  He said Thailand's success in reducing opium output to about 
20 tons per year was the result of the introduction of royal 
projects on cash crop substitution and rural development. 
  Chawalit was one of five guests invited to appear on Kho 
Khit 
Duai Khon (Sharing Views) chaired by Dr Choemsak Pinthong, 
associate professor of Thammasat University's Economics Faculty. 
The recorded programme will be telecast next month. 
  The crop substitution programmes have been recognized by UN 
drug agencies which are pushing for a regional effort to combat 
illicit drugs. Thailand, he said, has already signed an 
agreement with Burma and Laos to assist them in crop 
substitution programmes. 
  Chawalit said regional cooperation is also needed in 
suppressing drug trafficking. Traffickers have recently opened 
up new routes through China, but Thailand's good transport 
infrastructure still contributes to the majority of the area's 
heroin production moving through it onto the world market, he 
added. 
  He said the United States had already recognized the need to 
apply a multi-level anti-narcotics strategy including the 
reduction of local demand in its combat against drugs. The 
United States, he said, will concentrate in the next four to 
five years on the suppression of local demand and the 
rehabilitation of drug addicts. 
  Chawalit's views were shared by another panelist, Gary 
Suwannarat, a senior adviser of the UNDCP [United Nations Drug 
Control Program] Projects Coordination Office, who said the U.S. 
narcotics policy was partly wrong in concentrating mainly on 
suppressing the supply side while overlooking the reduction of 
local demand. 
  She [as published] said a multi-pronged antidrugs approach 
which addresses all aspects of narcotics activities is needed to 
successfully wipe out the drugs. Washington has said that 60 
per cent of the heroin in the United States originated in 
Southeast Asia. 
  Suwannarat, Chawalit and other guest speakers, however, 
cautioned that while heroin might be reduced eventually, other 
new addictive chemicals could spring up to fill the market. 
  According to Dr Annop Wisuthimak, director of a 
rehabilitation unit for drug addicts, alcohol is the worst and 
most devastating substance of abuse as it contributes to 
accidents and violent acts such as brawls and physical 
harassment. 
  One person is killed and three people are admitted to 
hospital every hour in Thailand as a result of alcohol-related 
incidents, said Annop, who cited survey studies to support his 
statements. 
  Other substances, such as inhaled solvents and amphetamines 
are more dangerous than heroin as they are relatively cheap and 
widely available in the market, according to Annop. But he said 
alcohol causes the largest economic loss to the country, about 
Bt80 billion per year. 
  Chawalit and Annop agreed that amphetamines will pose the 
greatest danger in Thailand in the future as the production 
process is much easier than that of heroin and can even be done 
in vehicles. 
  The ONCB secretary-general said there is a need to control 
the import of chemicals used to produce amphetamines and to 
suppress their illegal smuggling especially by fishing vessels. 
  Two years after Parliament passed new anti-narcotics laws 
which included the forfeiture of drug traffickers' assets, the 
courts have already tried and sentenced 11 narcotics cases and 
the police have subsequently seized the assets and properties of 
60 persons involved, according to Chawalit.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA June 13 -- The Vietnamese Government has 
allocated 46 billion VND [Vietnamese dong] for this year's 
effort in drug control and the prevention of drug abuse. 
  The allocation is also to cover expenditures for the 
drafting 
of an anti-drug law. 
  Last year, with a budget of 26 billion VND, the government 
brought into operation 95 projects which ranged from 
sendentarisation [as received] and resettlement for nomadic hill 
tribes to the replacement of opium poppy with food and other 
crops. Much was spent on mass education on the danger of drug 
and the treatment and vocational training for addicts. 
  Last year, the law enforcement force cracked down on 904 
cases of drug trafficking and eliminated hundreds of drug dens.

  [Text] Ahmedabad, May 14 (The Times of India News 
Service) -- The investigation into the seizure of Mandrax 
tablets worth over Rs 55 crores by the directorate of revenue 
intelligence (DRI) from trucks, on the Rajkot-Junagadh highway 
during the early hours of Wednesday has revealed that a 
notorious smuggler, Haji Haji Ismail, who was also involved in 
arms smuggling, was the alleged brain behind the transportation 
of the tablets, according to DRI sources. 
  The place of seizure was falsely declared to be on the 
highway near Jamnagar by top DRI officials for operational 
reasons. In fact, the trucks were intercepted near Jetpur on the 
Rajkot-Junagadh highway around 6 a.m. on Wednesday. 
  DRI sources said that the involvement of Haji Haji Ismail 
came to light during the interrogation of the four persons, 
Yusuf Rajak, Dhimaraj Gadhvi, Dinesh Harijan and Suda Hussain, 
who were detained from the trucks. 
  The truck drivers disclosed the names of the two 
transporters 
of Jamnagar, Khafi alias Karo Gafar Suleman and Ali Sumra, who 
provided the trucks for transporting the Mandrax tablets. They 
were also the main transporters involved in arms smuggling of 
Haji Haji Ismail a year ago. 
  The DRI officials raided the premises of Khafi and Ali in 
Jamnagar. Both the culprits are absconding for the past one 
year. Haji Haji Ismail and his two transporters, Khafi and Ali, 
are also wanted in some of the cases being investigated by the 
Jamnagar police. 
  The investigation revealed that the trucks were sent from 
Jamnagar by Khafi and Ali on May 9 to Visavadar town for lifting 
the steel drums containing Mandrax tablets. The trucks reached a 
particular farm on the outskirts of the Visavadar town, where 
the drums were hidden by some associates of Haji Haji Ismail. 
The name of the owner of the farm has been kept secret by the 
officials. 
  The drums were loaded into the two trucks by the four 
drivers 
and around 100 wheat bags were used by the culprits to cover the 
drums. The trucks left for Jamnagar late at night on May 10. It 
was further revealed that the drums were to be sent to Bangalore 
in vessels through Salaya Port with the help of some of the 
landing agents.

  [Text] Al-'Amrusiyah, Lebanon, June 16 (AFP) -- Lebanon 
destroyed on Thursday 31 tonnes of hashish with a street value 
of about 10 million dollars in what officials described as a 
record haul. 
  General Salim Salim, head of the criminal investigation 
department, told reporters the drugs had been mainly destined 
for Holland and were seized in cooperation with Syrian 
authorities last month. 
  "It's a sizeable seizure. The Lebanese authorities should be 
very pleased indeed today," Denis Gray, a police attache at the 
Australian High Commission in Cyprus, told AFP. 
  Gray, who was representing foreign police based in Cyprus, 
witnessed the operation along with officers from the British and 
French embassies in Beirut at the al-'Amrusiyah incinerator 10 
kilometers (six miles) south of Beirut. 
  In addition to the hashish, six kilograms of opium, three 
kilograms of heroin and two kilograms of cocaine also went up in 
smoke. 
  Around 20 people were arrested when the Lebanese Army in 
collaboration with the Syrian intelligence services ventured 
into remote mountainous areas of the al-Hirmil region of the 
Syrian-controlled al-Biqa' Valley. 
  "We ventured into very dangerous territory where we had not 
gone to since the 1920s," said Salim, who personally conducted 
the operations. 
  Huge fortunes from the drug trade were made in the al-Biqa', 
but the government in cooperation with Syrian authorities has 
set fire to poppy and cannabis fields in a ban imposed since the 
civil war ended in 1991.

  [Text] The Narcotics Control Board said today that it has 
announced that the security agencies seized 1.739 million kg of 
cocaine, heroin, and Indian hemp in 1993 and arrested 147 drug 
peddlers during the period. 
  According to figures released by the board, the haul is an 
increase on 1.471 million kg seized in 1992 during which 87 
people were arrested. The board said, however, that in view of 
inadequate facilities, the figures quoted fall below the actual 
trend. 
  It said 71 Ghanaians were arrested outside the country, 
mainly in the United States and Thailand.

  [Text] Sofia, June 16 (BTA) -- The National Council for 
Combatting Drug Abuse and Trafficking today approved a report of 
the Organized Crime Control Service and the National Narcotics 
Service (with the Ministry of Health Care) on an inquiry 
conducted in the region of Sandanski, Petrich and Melnik 
(southwestern Bulgaria) into illegal cultivation of opium poppy, 
BTA learnt from the Press Office of the Council of Ministers. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture has been assigned to draft a 
programme for restricting opium plantations by the end of 
September 1994. The council appointed a working group for 
updating the legislative basis on control over narcotic 
substances production, circulation and use, including on 
tightening control over poppy cultures. Mr. Pavlin Nedelchev, 
deputy justice minister, was appointed head of the working group. 
  The National Council decided to update the prices of 
narcotic 
substances subject to illegal trafficking to be used for the 
needs of the investigation, the court and the prosecution.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Majority of Teenagers Have </F>
Already Tried It"] 
  [Text] According to experts, drug consumption today in 
Hungary corresponds to the West Germany of the 1970's. 
Under-age people living in large cities are most at risk. In 
this respect, Szeged is considered to be an especially dangerous 
place. Szeged is a city along the Balkans drug route. The 
border crossing points and their surrounding areas at Nagylak 
and Roszke, the truck parking areas, and the market at Cserepes 
street, and half a dozen entertainment places in the city are 
intensely affected in the drug issue. Views differ on the 
number of drug users. It is estimated between 300 and 700. Some 
young people became drug addicts when glue-sniffing was in 
fashion, others have become addicts in recent times. Their 
number increases by some 50 each year. They mainly use cheap 
natural materials--mainly poppy--as a base. One dry poppy head 
costs 15 to 20 forints but the young people themselves can also 
get hold of green poppy. Some buy cigarettes costing 300 to 400 
forints. The spread of hard drugs is not yet typical. 
  Drug users usually enjoy the pleasure together, in 
apartments, mostly with materials made by themselves. A small 
number of known criminal cases are linked to drugs--some 12 of 
the 7,000 last year. However, it is not a negligible fact that 
more than half of the 14 to 18 age group has tried grass but in 
some classes, 90 percent of children said the same. It is a big 
problem that a large section of them see drugs as something 
positive. Recently, three deaths occurred that were directly 
linked with drugs. Prevention was first started in Szeged in 
1987 by chief physician doctor Terez Farkasinszky, who has 
earned undying credit nationally. The drug surgery is located 
in Ujszeged at 4 Fesu street where, on average, 20 to 30 young 
people are seen a day. Since November, a nationally unique 
rehabilitation center has been operating in the area of isolated 
farms at Deszk. Drug addicts who have gone through 
detoxification can come here voluntarily if they accept that 
they will not leave the institute for a year and will abide by 
the conditions.

    [Editorial Report] Several recent Polish newspaper items 
have described and commented on the rise of organized crime in 
Poland and its involvement in the international narcotics trade. 
<H5>  Criminal Gangs </H5>
  An editorial in the 28 April Warsaw daily POLSKA ZBROJNA 
complained of the increasing involvement of organized "gangs" in 
large-scale auto-theft, money-laundering, and drug-trafficking 
operations. The paper stated that these criminals, who are 
reportedly equipped with high-tech communications systems and 
fast cars that have no trouble in outrunning police cruisers, 
are able to use the profits from their criminal activities to 
thwart the criminal justice system: "Even if the police succeed 
in arresting a member of one of these gangs, highly qualified 
and generously paid lawyers get him out in 48 hours. Bail is 
paid immediately. The events described in the press every day 
confirm the rumors about corruption in the police department, 
the public prosecutor's office, and the courts." Frequent 
violent clashes between rival gangs have led the police to 
predict that "in the next few years, on the streets of our 
cities, one will be able to see scenes as depicted in the U.S. 
gangster films of the 1930's." 
<H5>  Polish "Mafia" </H5>
  A 19 May ZYCIE WARSZAWY article entitled "How a Mafia Is 
Born" noted that, while Polish authorities reject the use of the 
term "Mafia" for Polish gangs, there are "well-organized gangs" 
that control prostitution, extort protection money from 
legitimate businesses, smuggle drugs on a large scale, and have 
infiltrated the criminal justice system. According to the 
Warsaw daily, the three main gangs are named "Pruszkow," 
"Ozarow," and "Wolomind" after districts of the Polish capital. 
Increasingly violent "turf" wars are said to have included the 
use of military weapons, including hand grenades. 
<H5>  Police Powers Limited </H5>
  Journalist Ireneusz Krzeminski has traced the rise of 
organized crime to the limitations placed on police authority 
and procedures since 1989 by successive democratic governments. 
Writing in the 8 May RZECZPOSP0LITA, Krzeminski asserted that 
the new restrictions have demoralized the police and made them 
reluctant to take action, while, at the same time, emboldening a 
criminal element used to the harsh repressive measures of the 
communist regime. 
<H5>  Russian Example </H5>
  An editorial in the 9 May ZYCIE WARSZAWY warned that the 
recent experience of Russia demonstrated the dangers inherent in 
unimpeded growth of organized crime: "We should see what the 
Mafia has done in Russia, where, in only the past few years, it 
has become one of the forces controlling the country. Now they 
are looking toward us as partners. In this context, we should 
look at the development of organized crime in our country." 
<H5>  Drug Smuggling </H5>
  Polish criminals have made their country the fourth-largest 
European producer of illegal amphetamines, behind the 
Netherlands, Great Britain, and Belgium, according to an article 
in the 9 May ZYCIE WARSZAWY. Polish amphetamines are reportedly 
destined primarily for the German and Scandinavian markets. The 
paper noted that Polish drug dealers had been arrested recently 
in Berlin for attempting to sell 10 kilograms of Polish-produced 
amphetamines, worth approximately 144,0O0 German marks. 
  The 27 April ZYCIE WARSZAWY reported that the largest single 
seizure of illegal drugs in the history of Britain was made on 
board a Polish freighter in the harbor of Liverpool. The ship, 
which was en route from Venezuela to Poland, contained 520 
kilograms of "very-high-quality" cocaine, hidden in glue cans. 
The cocaine was said to have been intended for distribution to 
West European markets via Poland.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Commission </F>
Presents its Action Plan Which Seeks To Combat Drugs"] 
  [Text] Drug addiction and drug traffic represent a major 
threat to European citizens and a challenge that cannot be dealt 
with by the Twelve separately. On the basis of this dual 
observation, on Wednesday [8 June] the Commission presented its 
Communication on establishment of an EU action plan to combat 
drugs. The plan was presented by Commissioner Padraig Flynn. 
The Commission intends for the plan to provide a new basis for 
cooperation making it possible to profit fully from the new 
possibilities offered in this field by the Treaty on European 
Union. The treaty makes specific mention of drugs and drug 
addiction in the new provisions on public health and under 
cooperation in judicial and home affairs (third pillar). The 
proposed action plan covers the three key elements proper to the 
global approach needed with drugs, namely, action: 
  (i) for the prevention of drug addiction; 
  (ii) to combat drug traffic; 
  (iii) for international cooperation. 
  The communication also examines how to best ensure the 
coordination and coherence of actions at each level. The 
Commission's ideas in each of these areas are summarized below. 
  1. Reducing demand. Under Article 129 of the Treaty of 
Maastricht, the Commission will adopt (probably next week) a 
specific communication and a draft directive on the First 
Community Programme of Actions to Prevent Drug Addiction, 
falling in the domain of public health. This programme will be 
designed to: 
  (i) encourage and facilitate activities for high-risk groups 
in particular situations; 
  (ii) promote the identification, development, testing, and 
use of best practices to ensure the dissemination of information 
and to provide counseling for the target groups; 
  (iii) promote education and training initiatives in order to 
develop prevention strategies; 
  (iv) support work on early detection and counseling for drug 
users; 
  (v) promote social rehabilitation and reintegration. 
  2. Controlling drug traffic. This question requires action 
conducted in the Community context and in the form of 
cooperation as prescribed by the third pillar. At Community 
level, actions for the deflection of precursors and psychotropic 
substances and under the money-laundering directive have already 
led to considerable results. The Commission recommends boosting 
this action through: 
  (a) implementation of existing instruments (development of 
electronic mail networks to speed information-sharing, training, 
etc.); 
  (b) the promotion of cooperation with third countries, using 
the model of Community legislative instruments and other 
international agreements (negotiation of specific accords, 
participation in international initiatives, technical assistance 
for the development of legislation and administrative 
structures, information exchange, etc.); 
  (c) the evaluation of the practical implementation of these 
measures. 
  Title VI of the Treaty of Maastricht offers new 
possibilities 
for action at EU level in areas traditionally falling under 
intergovernmental cooperation, particularly containing an 
institutional obligation for police, customs and judicial 
cooperation in these areas of common interest. On this basis, 
the Commission invites the Member States to implement the Action 
Plan on Drugs and Money Laundering and the Priority Working Plan 
1994 adopted by the Justice/Home Affairs Council in November. 
These measures include: 
  (i) implementation of the ministerial agreement on the 
Europol Drug Unit and conclusion of the drafting of the 
convention establishing Europol in its totality; 
  (ii) the development of a strategy which includes reinforced 
controls at the EC's external frontiers; 
  (iii) implementation of measures to promote police 
cooperation. Under Article K1.4 which provides for measures to 
fight drug addiction which straddle Community competences and 
the third pillar, the Commission makes suggestions for 
supplementing actions under way at present, namely: 
  (a) interdisciplinary exchanges between officials and 
professional organisations involved in reducing the demand and 
supply of drugs; 
  (b) creation of a European forum for exchange and multi-city 
cooperation; 
  (c) cooperation in the field of drugs and their relation to 
crime. 
  3. International actions. In the Commission's view, the EU 
should supplement the action plan with an external aspect, 
making use of Community instruments and the new possibilities 
offered by the CFSP (common foreign and security policy). At 
Community level, action should focus on the following areas: 
  (i) continuation of EU participation in international 
efforts 
(UN programme for international drug control, the Council of 
Europe's Pompidou Group, etc.); 
  (ii) at bilateral level, reinforcement of national and 
regional strategies, in cooperation with certain countries or 
regions presenting a particular risk due to their proximity with 
the Union; 
  4. Coordination. The Communication underscores the 
importance of maintaining and improving coordination at the 
level of Member States and the EU, namely in the following 
contexts: 
  (i) coordination in and between Member States (national 
coordinators and Coreper should have an important role to play); 
  (ii) the European Observatory of drugs and drug addicts set 
up in Lisbon (it can contribute to the political decision-making 
procedure through the important role that it will have to fulfil 
in matters of information and analysis, in connection with its 
related network of national centres); 
  (iii) multidisciplinary aspects (information, research and 
training are considered priority themes, with the possibilities 
of improving the coherence of their implementation being 
examined).

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Dragan B. has been exposed as 
a cocaine dealer. He repeatedly smuggled cocaine from Belgium 
and Colombia to Austria. During his last coup he was caught in 
Dusseldorf by the German police, which had been alerted by the 
Austrians. He had four kg of cocaine on him with a street value 
of 7.5 million schillings. One kilogram of cocaine from former 
deliveries was found with the total of eight persons of the 
inner circle of the gang, among which it had been distributed. 
  In Belgium, the Vienna police has now established the 
identity of a high-ranking Belgian NATO officer who had supplied 
the cocaine. The Belgian authorities, however, have so far 
ignored the Austrian investigations: Not only has the arrest 
warrant not been executed, and the suspect, who has been 
incriminated by several witnesses, has not only not been 
extradited, the Belgians have not even arrested the man. "This 
man is somehow untouchable," sources from the Vienna police said. 
  Eight persons have been arrested, while complaints against 
another 25 have been filed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The narcotics police at Vienna's Schwechat Airport 
achieved another success in their struggle against drug-related 
crimes thanks to the good nose of one of their dogs and the 
dedication of their officers. On 9 June, police arrested a 
51-year-old Chilean at the airport who had arrived in Vienna 
from South America via Zurich. Two kg of cocaine were 
discovered in the man's suitcases. 
  The suspect also carried 20 faked $100 notes and 20 faked 
$100 travelers checks. Finally, the officers also managed to 
catch the Chilean's contact: A Spaniard, resident in Uruguay, 
who wanted to run away but was rounded up and arrested after one 
warning shot was fired. He should have taken the cocaine to 
Italy.

announcement of the winners of the Japanese Imperial Prize (the 
Japanese equivalent of the Nobel Prize for artistic 
disciplines), Jacques Chirac visited UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Drugs: Taking Action Where They Are Produced </H5>
  In addition, just as he had lengthy discussions on the drugs 
problems with President Clinton during his visit to Paris last 
week, Jacques Chirac argued for a "right of intervention at the 
initiative of the United Nations and under UN control" which 
would have the aim of destroying crops in the producer 
countries. "These initiatives should be taken in agreement with 
the countries concerned, who are seeing a growing consumption of 
drugs inside their own borders, while making provision for 
compensating the farmers," the Rally for the Republic president 
explained. 
  "Aside from prevention and repression," he explained, 
"action 
should be taken at the site of production," adding that this 
production, and especially that of hard drugs, is increasing in 
a dramatic way, "with the consequences with which we are 
familiar for individuals, and especially for young people, and 
also for the spread of AIDS. We also know the effect on wars, 
because it is the money from drugs which enables the purchase of 
weapons which are ever cheaper and which are then used to fight 
all kinds of ethnic confrontations. Finally, it is drugs which 
finance terrorism. If nothing is done, we will witness the 
destabilization of the whole world." 
  Jacques Chirac, who, in agreement with Bill Clinton, has 
decided to set up a working group to study the means of 
eradicating the scourge, intends to continue his awareness 
campaign. "This naturally depends on a mobilization of the 
United Nations without which," he said, "nothing can be done on 
this scale, and in close liaison with the Americans, who consume 
almost half of the world production."

<F P=106> [Report by Herbert Reinke-Nobbe and Frank Siering: "Plastic </F>
Bags Full of Money"] 
  [Text] The gentlemen of the Land Criminal Office [LKA] of 
Bavaria who entered the Munich city center branch of the 
Commerzbank on Monday last week behaved discreetly. Expertly, 
they searched the desk of a bank employee who was on sick leave, 
removed a few papers, and disappeared again. 
  At the same time, investigators rummaged through the 
contents 
of the desk of an employee of the Bayerische Hypo Bank, also in 
Munich, and checked bank account entries. A total of 170 
policemen and 18 prosecutors were involved in this operation. 
They investigated 41 premises in Munich, Hamburg, Dusseldorf, 
and Nuremberg, including 19 banks in Munich alone. 
  The reason for the raids: Bank employees are suspected of 
having helped drug dealers launder money stemming from drug 
deals. Says Guenter Gold, Bavaria LVA deputy chief: "The drug 
ring has existed for at least 10 years, in which time almost one 
billion German marks [DM] of heroin money has gone through the 
banks." 
  This is how the drug ring worked: Wholesale drug dealers 
from all over Europe paid for their heroin purchases in two 
small currency exchange booths at the Munich central railroad 
station and in the city center. "Couriers carried up to DM1.2 
million in plastic bags and suitcases to the exchange booths," 
says Dieter Zitzler-Ant, head of the "Mozart" investigation 
group set up on 1 June 1993. The owner of the exchange booths, 
Aydin G., a Turkish citizen, then carried the drug money, some 
DM50 million last year, to the bank. 
  Thus, the money-laundering began. Customer advisers in 
well-known banks then helped the Turk. They turned a blind eye 
to the legal requirement of reporting any financial transaction 
that exceeds DM20,000. In addition, they are supposed to have 
accepted forged receipts. Aydin G. used the money to pay drug 
couriers in Turkey, as well as the bills for legal transactions. 
  As a token of gratitude, the cooperating bank employees 
supposedly spent a few evenings in the beer gardens of Munich at 
the dealer's expense. They received several other little perks. 
  "There are black sheep everywhere," says Wilhelm Woebking, 
executive chief prosecutor, and spokesman for the Munich Supreme 
Land Court. "One must consider whether there is any way of 
surveilling bank employees via telephone. We have been calling 
for such a measure for a long time, within the framework of the 
law concerning money laundering." 
  The heroin, which in the opinion of the LKA officers 
amounted 
to 2.5 tonnes in 1993 alone, never went via Munich. Concealed 
in articulated trucks, it traveled from Istanbul via Romania, 
Hungary, or the Czech Republic to the destination 
countries--Spain, Italy, or Germany. 
  The suppliers received their money from Munich exchange 
booths that are suppose to belong to the chief of the drug ring, 
Muestecabi Dilek, 61. Says Gold: "In order to minimize the 
dangers involved in the transfer of money, there was no direct 
flow of money between the exchange booths in Munich and 
Istanbul." 
  Even so, the "Mozart" investigators discovered the drug 
dealers. They observed the activities of the heroin-mafias for 
one year. Then the criminal police pounced on the international 
drug ring, arrested 14 persons, confiscated 400 kg of heroin, 
seized about DM2 billion in cash, and sealed the two Munich 
exchange booths. Investigations are under way concerning at 
least 19 bank employees. 
  The banks are powerless against criminal bank employees. 
"The law on money laundering did not come into effect until 
November 1993. The preliminary experience is positive, says 
Stephan Steuer, chief lawyer for the Federal Association of 
German Banks. "However, erroneous conduct by individuals can 
never be ruled out. But an exacerbation of the law on money 
laundering would not be expedient." 
  In the meantime, FOCUS has discovered that "Mozart" officers 
are going from bank to bank with a list of 10 members of the 
drug ring. They want to know where the dealers had accounts. 
"Some of the suspects had accounts with us, but no significant 
ones," said the spokesman for one large bank.

  [Text] Attika has been an unwelcome host to a crime wave 
over the past five years. 
  From 22 murders in 1989, this figure more than doubled two 
years later, reaching a record number of 56. 
  1989 was the most successful year for the police: Only two 
of the 22 murders still remain a mystery. But 1991 was both 
busy and difficult: Only 39 cases out of 56 were solved. So 
far, 23 out of last year's 42 murders have been put to rest. 
  The homicide department is regarded as one of the best 
organised branches at Attiki police headquarters. From 199 
murders committed in the last five years, 138 were solved, a 
satisfactory percentage bearing in mind the shortage of 
specialised staff in the department. However, as the chart 
shows, the percentage of murders solved has declined rapidly 
since 1989. 
  11,750 burglaries and thefts were reported last year, 
compared to 8,100 in 1987. The rising quantities of drugs 
confiscated by the police are indicative of the increase in drug 
trafficking, since only a small percentage of the total is 
confiscated. 
  About 37 kilos of hashish and seven kilos of heroin were 
seized in 1985 but in 1992 the numbers jumped to 102 and 79 
kilos respectively. Overdose deaths soared accordingly. 14 
persons died in 1985 while 66 deaths were recorded in 1993. In 
1993, the drug squad arrested 546 persons and confiscated about 
41 kilos of hashish and 37 kilos of heroin. The increase in 
crime is obvious but, equally challenging to police, is that 
criminals have become more organised. 
  The police statistics contend that the influx of Albanian 
immigrants into Greece has contributed to the rise in crime. 
Felonies committed by them are difficult for the police since 
they have to chase people "without identity". Organised gangs 
carrying out armed bank robberies are another headache the 
police could well do without. 
  The department investigating burglaries and thefts has not 
been as successful as its murder counterpart. From a total of 
52,610 cases reported in the last five years, only 9,210 were 
solved. In 1993, out of 11,750 thefts 2,320 were solved and 
1,320 people arrested.

<F P=106> [Article by Stephen Dodd: "Teenage Drugs Sub-culture Survey </F>
Shock"] 
  [Text] Six out of every 10 Dublin teenagers have been 
offered illegal drugs. More than half the young people in the 
city know someone who has used amphetamines or ecstasy. A 
similar percentage of Ireland's youth believe they would 
encounter little difficulty in finding regular suppliers of 
drugs. 
  These disturbing discoveries come from an exclusive survey, 
conducted by Irish Marketing Surveys for the SUNDAY INDEPENDENT. 
The poll reveals evidence of the existence of an alarming drug 
sub-culture among the teenagers of Ireland. It is the first of 
its kind to examine the influence of narcotics and alcohol on 
the young, and has taken its findings from a representative 
sample of teenagers, aged between 15 and 17, at 58 different 
towns and cities throughout the country. The survey was 
rigorously controlled to ensure no bias against social groups or 
classes. Irish Marketing Surveys, the country's leading 
statistical analysts, are confident the results are beyond doubt. 
  That confidence is important, because the results of the 
survey clearly demonstrate that the spread of drug and alcohol 
abuse among the young has become a widespread problem in 
Ireland. Our own investigations have revealed the ease with 
which illegal narcotics are imported; the new poll shows the 
scale of their impact. 
  Researchers discovered that awareness of drug-taking has 
escalated to the point where it has become an important hurdle 
facing adolescents. Almost half the sample group cited peer 
pressure as the main reason for young people to take drugs. 
Teenagers who use drugs are striving to be accepted into the 
sub-culture, to fit into what they see as an intriguing and 
attractive group. Others take drugs for kicks; 39 percent of 
those questioned said they used drugs to feel good, to get high 
or for fun. One in every four teenagers claimed they used 
narcotics and alcohol to escape stress and family problems. 
  Perhaps most worrying is the discovery that drugs are today 
readily accessible to young people. Teenagers in Dublin and 
Leinster are most likely to know where to find drugs--discos, 
night clubs and street dealers proved the most common 
sources--while young people on Connacht and Ulster claimed drugs 
were rarer. Seventy percent of Connacht/Ulster teenagers did not 
know where drugs were sold in their towns. 
  There was a good degree of recognition of the dangers of 
illegal drugs, with more than 90 percent of those questioned 
believing that heroin, cocaine, crack and LSD were too dangerous 
even for experimentation. 
  Young people appear to view alcohol in a different light, 
with 35 percent of those polled believing there was no real 
danger in drinking. 
  In Dublin, the evidence points to a higher level of drug 
abuse among the young. More than half of the teenagers 
questioned knew someone who had experimented with ecstasy or 
amphetamines, while almost a quarter knew someone who used the 
drugs regularly. One in every 10 Dublin teenagers knows at least 
one heroin user. 
  On a positive note, it appears that 85 percent of young 
people are being given drug education at school, and most of 
those find the information helpful. Professional drug 
counsellors are held in the highest regard among the young, with 
93 percent claiming they would treat seriously any advice they 
gave. 
  Other sources of advice and example are more alarming. One 
in 
five teengers admitted that hearing about pop stars' involvement 
with drugs might tempt them to experiment themselves.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Growth of Organized </F>
Crime--Gangs Are Increasingly Settling Into the World of 
Ordinary Life, CRI Says"] 
  [Text] Organized crime in the Netherlands is on the 
increase. Moreover, criminal groups are becoming more and more 
professional and are increasingly managing to settle into the 
world of ordinary life, claims the 1993 annual report by the 
Central Research Information division (CRI), which was published 
Wednesday [15 June]. 
  The CRI, which collects data on crime, confirms that in 
1993, 
there were 98 active criminal gangs that could be described as 
"highly organized." In 1991, there were 59, and when they were 
first inventoried in 1988 only three such groups were detected. 
  By organizing themselves in a more professional manner, 
these 
gangs are making increasingly large profits. For example, the 
CRI cites the ecstasy group that was broken up in 1992, which 
achieved an annual turnover of 300 million guilders [G], with a 
net result of G240 million. Only a few tens of millions could 
be traced. The rest has probably been invested in the world of 
ordinary life. 
  The CRI notes that the proceeds of crime are laundered on a 
large scale in the Netherlands. Already back in 1991, the 
Fiscal Information and Investigation Department calculated that 
G1 billion were being laundered every nine months, using 
exchange offices among other methods. According to the CRI, the 
control of unusual money transfers has now been improved. 
  One growing new trend is for criminal groups to attempt to 
counter the work done by the police and justice authorities. 
The gangs observe police officers at work and also eavesdrop on 
them, threaten senior officers in the course of investigations, 
and spread false reports aimed at portraying such officers in a 
damaging light. These defamation campaigns are causing the 
police and justice departments considerable nuisance because on 
each occasion an inquiry has to be made as to whether there can 
be talk of corruption. 
  Organized crime has a strongly international character. 
Criminal gains are channeled off to tax paradises where there 
is little monitoring of finances. Approximately 40 percent of 
the core members of highly organized gangs come from abroad. 
They mete out physical violence more often than criminal groups 
led by Netherlanders. In 1993, there were more than 100 fatal 
shootings, 23 of which were executions carried out among the 
criminal fraternity. 
  The annual report also provides data on specific offenses: 
Narcotic trafficking remains one of the most lucrative forms of 
organized crime. Several hundred criminal organizations are 
involved in such activities. According to the CRI, 85 percent 
of the heroin encountered in the Netherlands is brought in by 
Turkish gangs working the so-called Balkan route. Turkish 
coffee houses play a major role in such sales. 
  Smuggling cocaine to Europe is virtually entirely in the 
hands of organizations based in the Colombian town of Cali. In 
1993, more heroin and cocaine was intercepted than in 1992. In 
addition, a higher number of drug laboratories were closed down. 
However, the total amount of marijuana confiscated by the 
authorities decreased. 
  The number of attempted hold-ups increased from almost 2300 
to approximately 2700, but the number of successful hold-ups 
dropped. Financial institutions, hotels, and restaurants, and 
"other businesses" are the main targets of armed robbers. 
One-third of all hold-ups are committed within the area of 
jurisdiction of Amsterdam, which comprises the provinces of 
North Holland and Utrecht. 
  Relatively speaking, the number of hold-ups is increasing 
fastest (by 35 percent) in the police region of 
Rotterdam-Rijmond. For the fifth successive year, the 
percentage of solved hold-ups has decreased. The figure for 
1993 is 29 percent. 
  The number of car thefts has doubled in just 10 years. In 
1993, more than 33,000 motor vehicles were stolen. Cars 
manufactured by Opel are the favorite targets of car thieves, by 
a margin of almost 10,000 vehicles. Of all the vehicles stolen, 
59 percent are subsequently found, half of these within five 
days of being stolen. According to the CRI, this means that many 
thefts are instances of joyriding, i.e. "the fulfillment of a 
one-off need for a vehicle." 
  Finally, the annual report indicates that a higher number of 
financial and economic offenses are being committed. Since the 
Center for Reporting Unusual Transactions was set up two years 
ago, more than 5000 suspicious financial transactions have been 
reported, worth a total of G2.4 billion. It emerged that in 
half of these cases, the persons involved already had a criminal 
record. A considerably higher number of forged banknotes were 
confiscated, the 100-guilder note being the forgers' favorite. 
  Thanks to better registration by three special police teams, 
a substantially higher number of instances of computer crime 
came to light. One new form of computer crime involves the 
misuse of international telecommunications facilities. For 
example, it was discovered that long-distance calls were being 
made at the local Netherlands tariff from the Netherlands via 
Denmark. The Danish telephone company concerned lost 
approximately G2.5 million as a result.

  [Text] The seizure of over 17 kg of heroin that occurred on 
Tuesday night at the Portela airport in Lisbon prompted the 
Criminal Investigations Police [PJ] to issue a communique. The 
message deplores "the lack of cooperation on the part of the DGA 
(General Customshouse Directorate) employees, who were unwilling 
to intervene until PJ agents insisted, and after consultations 
between the authorities present in the customs inspection area." 
  The communique distributed yesterday also notes that, "the 
Criminal Investigations Police, after making insistent requests 
of DGA personnel, who appeared reluctant to start inspecting 
baggage because it was from a flight originating in European 
space (Rotterdam)," ended up undertaking the largest heroin 
seizure made in Portugal this year (17.380 kg). 
  After PUBLICO reported the seizure in yesterday's edition, 
the heads of the Central Directorate for Narcotics Trafficking 
Investigation (DCITE) called a press conference at which, 
besides discussing the criticism of the DGA, reported that 
another man linked to the trafficking network had been arrested. 
The fourth person arrested in the course of the operation, 
called "Clean Channels," is an individual from Porto, to whom 
the drugs presumably were to be delivered. 
  The first three taken into custody were aged between 18 and 
35 years, natives of Cape Verde, who arrived from Rotterdam, in 
the Netherlands. They were supposed to deliver the heroin to 
supply the Lisbon and Porto markets, according to a statement 
made by the PJ's assistant general director, Gabriel Catarino. 
<H5>  Sufficient Heroin for 268,000 Doses </H5>
  The same official claimed that the confiscated drugs, with a 
high degree of purity, would have been possible to distribute in 
268,000 doses (the so-called "quarters," each weighing a quarter 
of a gram). 
  The police expressed concern over the fact that the heroin 
arrived "poorly packed," possibly indicating "that the 
traffickers were so sure of not being caught that they didn't 
even take any great precautions." The drugs, presumably from 
Turkey, as was later revealed, were stored in four plastic 
containers, some at the bottom of a suitcase, and another 
wrapped in a bedspread. 
  The Criminal Investigations Police officials also commented 
that "agents were at the airport since last Wednesday, watching 
the flights arriving from Rotterdam," since there had been 
indications that the three "couriers," all connected with the 
traffic, were due to unload the drugs in Lisbon. 
  One of the individuals captured at Portela, although he has 
a 
fixed residence in the Netherlands, also owned a house in the 
Lisbon area. A scale with traces of heroin, a grinder, and a 
portable phone were found on those premises. 
  The Porto resident arrested is another person who was 
already 
under suspicion. All four were presented to the judge of the 
Court of Criminal Proceedings yesterday. The Criminal 
Investigations Police do not preclude the possibility that 
further arrests may be made.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonor Figueiredo] </F>
  [Excerpts] Drug consumption among the youths in 
compulsory military service has declined. The military claim 
that this is the victory won by deterrence. Positive screening 
test results dropped from 18.1 percent in 1989 to 5.8 percent in 
1993. 
  A "conquest": a euphoric atmosphere prevails at the Army's 
Analytical Toxicology Laboratory. The personnel exhibit the 
declining figures on drug consumption as if a method for 
recovery from drug addiction with proven success had been found. 
  "Soon, we'll reach three percent, and without coercive 
action." Major Mario Pragosa, chief of the Clinical Pathology 
Service at the Principal Military Hospital, where the laboratory 
analyzing the urine collected in the barracks is installed, 
emphasizes this to DN [DIARIO DE NOTICIAS]. The annual trends in 
positive samples revealing drug consumption indicate an enormous 
reduction since 1989, when the Army, simultaneously with the Air 
Force, implemented the program to prevent and combat drugs and 
alcoholism in the Portuguese Armed Forces, years after the Navy 
had initiated its own tests. 
  In 1989, the first year of the testing, 18 percent of the 
1,462 individuals analyzed revealed drug consumption. Since 
then, the percentage has not stopped falling: 11.4 percent 
positive among 4,445 members of the military in 1990; 10.7 
percent among 4,920 individuals in 1991; 9.1 percent among 4,568 
tested in 1992; and 5.8 percent among the 7,465 analyzed last 
year. 
<H5>  Deterring Tests </H5>
  This indicator of a reduction in drug consumption is all the 
more surprising when one realizes that it has not stopped rising 
among the civilian society. According to Mario Pragosa, however, 
the deterring power of the tests is what is mainly responsible 
for this decline occurring among youths aged between 18 and 21 
years. "The results have a great psychological effect, and no 
one wants the stigma of being a drug addict. The same thing is 
happening in the United States. Within 10 years, they managed to 
reduce the figure from 46 to 3.5 percent," he argues. Other 
factors could be associated with it: "There is more information, 
prevention, and carefulness in detecting drugs in the barracks." 
  The prevention begins in the units, through officers trained 
in courses on preventing and deterring consumption given at the 
Armed Forces' School of Health, and created to supplement the 
surveillance program. This program defines the dangers involved 
in the use of toxic substances in the Armed Forces: "The 
promotion of drug use among members of the military institution, 
as a deliberate act, or for trafficking purposes, can have very 
serious consequences, specifically, for military security, as 
well as negative effects on the Armed Forces' discipline and 
operativeness." It maintains: "The soldier taking drugs or 
overdoing alcohol consumption jeopardizes the security of 
personnel, materiel, installations, and intelligence, as well as 
the organization's overall health. This entails grave 
consequences for the performance of missions, and for the Armed 
Forces' prestige." 
  In 1993, the drugs most consumed and detected by the tests 
were still in the cannabinoids group (76 percent), followed by 
cannabinoids combined with opiates (13.5 percent), opiates (7.8 
percent), and various other combinations (2.7 percent). 
  According to the official in charge of the tests, the trends 
in the drugs most used indicate that the cannabinoids are being 
used less (in 1991, they accounted for 83.6 percent of the total 
consumption). However, the combination of cannabinoids and 
opiates (which was 8.2 percent in that same year) is rising. 
  Most of the urine tests are made on youths who have been 
recruited, as well as among volunteers and those requesting a 
deferment of their period of stay in the Armed Forces. However, 
soldiers in the regular military ranks do not escape this 
checking, which is random and without a set day or date. 
Nevertheless, Mario Pragosa claims: "I can count on the fingers 
of one hand the number of cases of drug addiction" among career 
troops: equivalent to 0.05 percent. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  [Box, p 20] </H5>

  -  The cannabinoids remain the drugs most consumed among the 
youths performing their compulsory military service. 
  -  Consumption is prevented on the unit level through officers 
who 
have taken specialized courses at the Armed Forces School of 
Health. 
  -  The military want to reduce the consumption rate to 3 
percent. And they are gratified by the fact that these results 
will be accrued without coercive measures. 
  -  The number of 
soldiers subjected to tests has gradually increased since 
1989.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Bento Amaro] </F>
  [Text] Real estate, hotel establishments, casinos, 
lotteries, and the purchase of objects made of gold and other 
precious metals are the main destinations of the money laundered 
in Portugal. There are currently 20 proceedings related to the 
"laundering" of money originating in the drug traffic. There 
have been no detentions, nor even dates set for trials. 
  According to a Criminal Investigations Police [PJ] official, 
most (nearly half) of the laundering cases are associated with 
the Lisbon area. The industrialized zones in the north and the 
Algarve recreational areas are other sites mentioned in the 
proceedings. 
  The same police source also notes that, in the respective 
proceedings, the amount of money laundered is unknown. However, 
when one observes the sectors chosen for its application (gold, 
hotels, casinos, etc.), it is not difficult to conclude that 
"the sums of money involved are too large for the local 
environment." 
  One of the main ventures of the individuals engaged in money 
laundering in Portugal is the purchase of lottery tickets. 
According to the agents from the Central Directorate for 
Narcotics Trafficking Investigation (this being the section 
dealing with all laundering cases, since all those known are 
associated with the drug traffic), the method consists of 
purchasing large numbers of whole tickets at prices slightly 
higher than those stipulated. There is almost always a guarantee 
of profits accrued by whoever sells them. 
  In the case of the casinos, the money is "blended" through 
the purchase of chips, which are later exchanged for cash. 
"`Dirty' money is used to purchase chips, and then, after a few 
bets, the same chips are exchanged for money; and, at some 
point, the player no longer has any illegally procured assets." 
The police call this rotation "blending." There are also some 
who illustrate the operation by using the example of a sausage 
stuffing machine: "The pork enters at one end, and the sausages 
emerge from the other. When the operation is finished, there is 
always meat." 
  As for the nationalities of those involved in the 
proceedings 
that are under way, although the majority are Portuguese, there 
are also individuals born or settled in "other European 
countries (heroin trafficking cases) and on other continents 
(South Americans connected with the cocaine business)." 
<H5>  Trials Could Take Years </H5>
  The absence of detained persons and, particularly, the 
uncertainty regarding when the first trials for laundering can 
begin, are justified by the late date on which Portugal obtained 
proper legislation. It was not until 15 September of last year 
that a Community directive issuing regulations pertaining to 
this crime was adopted. 
  The slowness of the proceedings is also attributed, by 
Criminal Investigations Police officials, to the fact that the 
suspects identified to date are individuals of considerable 
means. Therefore, "they have sufficient financial capacity to 
engage the best lawyers, thus achieving foot-dragging in the 
procedures, through funds and more funds." 
  The Portuguese proceedings and law relating to money 
laundering are, moreover, included among the topics for 
discussion during the seminar to be held at Vilamoura from 29 
May to 2 June. Besides the Portuguese police, officials from the 
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) stationed in Madrid, and 
police from Spain, Gibraltar, Andorra, Italy, and probably 
Sweden, will be present at the meeting. 
  Contrary to previous reports, the International Seminar on 
Money Laundering is not the Portuguese authorities' first 
attempt to deal with the problem. In fact, last year the issue 
prompted several meetings between the PJ and other police forces 
affiliated with Interpol.

<F P=106> [Press release from the UK National Criminal Intelligence </F>
Service: "National Criminal Intelligence Service Reshapes 
Itself"] 
  [Text] Albert Pacey, Director General of the National 
Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), today outlined the way 
forward for the service in its fight against major criminal 
activity in the UK. 
  `NCIS was formed two years ago out of disparate units drawn 
from various parts of the police service. Having established 
itself as an effective intelligence-gathering organisation, it 
is now appropriate to ensure that the structure of the 
organisation is capable of continuing to deliver high quality 
intelligence packages to our main customers: regionally based 
law enforcement agencies. 
  `Following wide consultation and an internal review, a 
revised mission statement and strategic aims have been 
introduced. The new strategy is intended to position NCIS in 
the intelligence world and to give sharper focus to its work. 
  `In order to deliver the new strategy the structure of NCIS 
has been revised and will comprise: 
  -- UK Division encompassing all five regional offices and 
the 
current Scottish/Irish Liaison Unit; 
  -- International Division which will integrate the 
intelligence product of Interpol more fully within NCIS. It will 
also contain the European Drugs Liaison Officer network and a 
newly created Europol section to act as the national focal point 
for intelligence to and from Europol HQ in the Hague; and 
  -- HQ Division providing strategic intelligence by means of 
a 
revamped Strategic and Specialist Intelligence Branch. This 
will maintain an organised crime unit, football unit and 
specialist crimes unit. Additionally it will house a newly 
formed economic crimes unit and a new drugs unit. 
  `This new structure will allow NCIS to provide leadership 
and 
excellence in criminal intelligence. We have moved away from a 
`commodity' based approach to crime to a `functional' one which 
will clarify our role. Underpinning this revised strategy will 
be our new integrated computer `brain': ALERT which is due to 
come on stream from 1 April 1995. It will be a flexible system 
allowing for the passing of intelligence and its analysis. 
  `I believe that this new strategy and structure with its 
clearly defined areas of activity and clear lines of 
communication will prevent duplication of effort and ensure that 
intelligence is not lost. NCIS will continue to lead the way in 
providing high quality intelligence to law enforcement agencies 
and together combat major criminal activity.' 
<H5>  Notes </H5>
  1. Albert Pacey, CBE [Commander of the most noble order of 
the British Empire], QPM [Queen's Police Medal], has been the 
Director General of the National Criminal Intelligence Service 
since August 1993. He was speaking today at a press conference 
at NCIS HQ. 
  2. The following guiding principles have been established in 
the review of NCIS structure: 
  - NCIS is a criminal focused organisation; 
  - the business of NCIS should, where possible, be split on a 
functional rather than a commodity basis; 
  - the development of tactical intelligence on UK nationals 
residing in the UK should be performed in the regional offices; 
  - the development of strategic intelligence should be 
carried 
out at headquarters; 
  - the development of tactical intelligence on UK nationals, 
or non-UK subjects of interest to NCIS, who live or are 
primarily based outside the UK should be performed at 
headquarters; 
  - there must be clearly defined areas of activity with clear 
lines of communication to prevent duplication of effort and to 
ensure that intelligence is not lost; 
  - NCIS should establish its own unique identity, with a 
structure which meets the needs of the organisation and its 
users. 
  3. The organisation's new mission statement, structure and 
strategic aims are attached. (Hard copy only.) PRESS ENQUIRIES:

<F P=106> [Article by David Leppard: "Police Defeated in War Against </F>
Drug Epidemic"] 
  [Text] Police chiefs are demanding a radical change in 
government strategy as they finally admit they have lost the war 
against drug abuse. They want ministers to consider a 
controversial scheme to allow all 25,000 registered drug addicts 
to receive heroin and other drugs free on the national service. 
  They are also demanding a royal commission on drug control 
and an American-style national drugs task force to spearhead a 
new anti-drugs campaign. 
  "We've won several battles but we've lost the war," Keith 
Hellawell, chairman of the chief constables' committee on drugs, 
said yesterday. "The current policy has not stopped young people 
turning to drugs. 
  "It has not stopped the violence and other crime related to 
drugs. We need to win the hearts and minds of a generation and 
turn them around." 
  Tony Blair, shadow home secretary and the favourite to 
become 
Labour party leader, last night supported the police initiative. 
"It is desperately important that the government recognises the 
scale and urgency of the drugs problem," he said. "It must put 
together a comprehensive programme which cuts demand as well as 
supply." 
  Police alarm at the rising drugs menace follows new evidence 
that Britain is caught up in a drugs explosion. Chief constables 
say existing policy has failed to stop the emergence of a "drugs 
generation" made up of tens of thousands of youngsters who have 
turned to crime to meet their drugs bills. 
  Hellawell will unveil fresh evidence of the crisis when he 
chairs the chief constables' drugs conference at Wakefield next 
week. "It's extremely serious. It's not just confined to the big 
cities. This affects every city and town in the country. It's 
right across society, it's right across our youth. I will 
guarantee your children have been offered drugs or at least know 
about drugs in their school. 
  "Headmasters are keeping it under wraps. This is a cancer in 
our society that has to be excised. Otherwise I don't know where 
it will lead." 
  Richard Browne, Britain's chief customs drugs investigator, 
told THE SUNDAY TIMES: "I can stem the flow. I can make it more 
difficult for them and restrict the amount that comes in. But we 
can't link arms around the coastline and stop it. It's a 
bottomless pit." 
  Chief Superintendent Paul Cook, head of community affairs 
and 
drugs in Greater Manchester, admitted that police and Customs 
had failed to halt the drugs explosion. "The entire police 
effort over the last 25 years has had no discernible effect on 
the availability of drugs on the streets," he said. "I've talked 
to ministers until I'm blue in the bloody face. We have got to 
address this problem." 
  A cabinet sub-committee set up last year under Tony Newton, 
leader of the Commons, is considering switching resources from 
policing to reducing drugs demand among the young. The review, 
due to report to John Major this summer, is likely to propose 
giving the police a greater role in educating the public about 
drugs. 
  Police chiefs warn, however, that Britain is facing a drugs 
crisis matching the worst affected cities in the United States. 
Philip Thomas, West Midlands assistant chief constable and head 
of crime operations, said: "Drug dealers are protecting a trade 
which is causing more social disruption than anything else in 
our society." 
  "There have been drug-related shootings in Liverpool, 
Manchester and eight in Birmingham in the last 12 months," says 
Thomas. Last year there were 31 drug-related murders and 
attempted murders in London alone. 
  New research shows the black market in heroin, cocaine, 
cannabis and other illegal drugs is now worth &pound;5 billion a 
year. Police, fearful of the "knock-on" effect on burglaries, 
car thefts, credit card fraud and street robberies, point to new 
figures showing that Britain has overtaken the United States in 
car crime, previously the record holder. 
  Customs chiefs revealed last week that Britain is now the 
most lucrative market in the world for heroin and cocaine 
traffickers, giving international drugs syndicates a profits 
"premium" of more than 30 percent. 
  Crack, the highly addictive cocaine derivative, is a growing 
source of concern. "We're seeing huge amounts being targeted at 
Britain and Europe," said Browne. 
  Large quantities of pure cocaine are being shipped to "crack 
factories" in the inner cities including Tottenham, Stoke 
Newington and Brixton in London, Moss Side in Manchester and 
parts of Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh. 
  Manchester police estimates that the average heroin addict 
consumes nearly &pound;30,000 worth of the drug each year, paying 
for their habit by street dealing, prostitution and theft.

  [Text] One of two men found guilty of smuggling &pound;60 
million worth of drugs was jailed for 25 years yesterday. 
  The haul was hidden in a tanker full of egg yolk products 
which was driven into Britain through Dover docks. 
  It was stopped in Dagenham, Essex, and the drugs were 
recovered after the tanker was unloaded, Maidstone Crown Court 
was told. 
  Robert Doubtfire, 32, from Broadwalk, Blackheath, south 
London, and Frans van Taternhove, 44, a Dutchman, had denied the 
charges. 
  Taternhove was jailed for 25 years and the &pound;8,000 in 
cash 
that he had on him when arrested was confiscated. No other 
assets could be traced. Doubtfire will be sentenced next week. 
Judge David Croft, QC [expansion not given], said: "This 
smuggling operation was an attack on society." 
  After the case, Det Insp Peter Ship, said: "This was a very 
sophisticated operation. A lot of money was spent on setting up 
the tanker to conceal the drugs." 
  The containers were riveted shut and made to look invisible. 
  "The tanker's tachograph was set up in such a manner that it 
gave the impression the lorry was on a completely different 
route, which made it very hard to trace," said the inspector. 
  "We have taken two criminals off the street and hit 
organised 
crime where it hurts most," he added.

<F P=106> [Article by James Meikle: "Heads Call for Drive Against Drug </F>
Taking"] 
  [Text] Head teachers will call for tough action against 
drug taking among young people this week amid growing evidence 
of the ease with which schoolchildren can obtain illegal 
substances. 
  Allegations that pupils are turning to crime and 
prostitution 
to pay for experimentation or to finance addiction will be 
voiced by members of the National Association of Head Teachers 
meeting in Eastbourne. 
  A recent study in the Northwest indicated that six in 10 14- 
and 15-year-olds had the opportunity to try drugs, and there is 
increasing concern that primary schoolchildren are becoming 
involved. 
  The plea for a co-ordinated campaign of education about 
drugs 
and measures to combat their illicit trade among children 
coincides with a government review, headed by Tony Newton, 
Leader of the House of Commons, to clarify national policies on 
the issue. 
  One source said: "There is concern we reduce to an 
irreducible minimum, the proportion of children taking drugs. 
Education [about drugs] is part of the national curriculum and 
the question is how effectively it can be taught in schools, who 
should be doing it, and in what form." 
  Martin Saunders, a primary school headteacher from 
Stoke-on-Trent, said yesterday: "I have evidence of at least one 
child drug-dealing at the age of eight in this city. There is 
increasing evidence that young people are involved in crime to 
obtain finance to buy drugs. I have social and welfare officers 
talking to me about young people being involved in prostitution 
to pay for drugs." 
  Mr Saunders said many heads were worried that their schools 
would get labeled as problem schools and lose pupils, and 
therefore money, if they talked openly about drugs. 
  Drugs education experts are angry that the Department for 
Education last year dropped central support for health education 
co-ordinators. 
  Alasdair Cant, training manager for Release, the national 
drug advice service, said the biggest increase in calls in the 
last 18 months had involved children aged 11 to 14. "We have 
seen them coming into drugs, not just hearing about it from 
older brothers or sisters, but being in a group where substances 
are being taken or experimenting themselves." 
  But no overall policy meant that "in one area, one school 
will do one thing and another something completely different. It 
is confusing for parents and students." More schools are using 
former drug addicts to talk to children. Drug educators, 
including the Advisory Council on Alcohol and Drug Education, 
believe that teaching about illegal drugs should be closely 
integrated with teaching on more socially tolerated drugs. 
  Liverpool education authority and Merseyside police last 
week 
launched a new initiative attempting to develop consistent 
policies, including a recommendation that all serious incidents 
in schools should be reported to the police. 
  David Barrie, the city's assistant director of education, 
said that exclusion from school should be used only as a last 
resort. "We are not saying drugs are trivial. But where a young 
person is excluded, he or she can get into far more serious 
trouble." 
  The Education Secretary, John Patten, last week decided to 
drop his suggestion that drug trafficking might be a reason for 
excluding pupils, leaving decisions to heads and governing 
bodies. But David Hart, general secretary of the NAHT [expansion 
not given], said most questions about dealing with drugs came 
from secondary school members, and most involved grounds for 
excluding pupils. "It sends a bad message to the rest of the 
pupil community. It says you can get away with sampling drugs or 
trafficking in drugs on school premises or during the school 
day."

<F P=106> [Igor Galichin report under the "Contraband" rubric: "Kim </F>
Il-song Regime Increases Infiltration Into Russia. North Korean 
Citizens Bring Eight Kilograms of Heroin Into Russia"] 
  [Text] Your SEGODNYA correspondent has learned from 
competent sources that a successful operation was conducted in 
Maritime Kray a few days ago to stop an attempt to smuggle 
heroin from North Korea into Russia. The operation in this case 
was mounted simultaneously by several agencies: the Russian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs Directorate for Combating Illicit 
Turnover of Drugs; the kray internal affairs administration; the 
Pacific Fleet Counterintelligence Service; border troops; and 
the local directorate of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service. According to information available to the editorial 
office, the events developed in the following manner: On 9 
June, operatives held two citizens of North Korea on suspicion 
of smuggling in a big amount of narcotics from the territory of 
the DPRK. Their names have not been disclosed at the 
investigation's request. The detectives' expectations were 
justified: The check turned up eight kilograms of heroin in the 
possession of these citizens. Both North Koreans were arrested. 
Criminal proceedings have been instituted. The DPRK is a unique 
enclave where a Stalinist regime has been preserved in a 
classical form. The population in that country is under total 
surveillance by the special services, and to go abroad one has 
to go through the strictest screening. To smuggle such a large 
amount of the narcotic from North Korea without the deliberate 
connivance of the authorities appears most improbable. The 
value of the heroin seized from the DPRK citizens is $1 million 
at the going rate on the world drugs market, which is all the 
more impressive against the backdrop of the economic plight of 
Kim Il-song's regime.

  [Text] Pyongyang, 17 June -- Representatives of the Russian 
Embassy and trade mission in the DPRK had difficulty answering 
questions from an ITAR-TASS correspondent about the activities 
of "Monolit," a Russian-North Korean joint venture. They said 
that they were unaware of such an enterprise as it had never 
come up before. On 9 June several employees of the joint 
venture were caught redhanded trying to smuggle eight kg of 
heroin, worth a million dollars, into Russia. 
  One of the sources suggested to ITAR-TASS that the venture 
might be one of those which is sometimes created by DPRK 
representatives in the Russian Federation without going through 
Russian legal processes. Knowledge of such joint ventures is, 
as a rule, confined to an extremely small circle of trusted 
people.

  [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- Moscow's police continue the 
operation code-named "Mak" (Poppy) on the Moscow metro in an 
attempt to curb the rising wave of crime in the Russian capital. 
  Over the two weeks since the beginning of the operation, the 
police have seized over 20 kilograms of drugs. 
  On Tuesday, on one of the metro stations they detained a 
resident of Tajikistan who was carrying one kilogram of opium. 
An investigation was launched. 
  The operation is generally viewed as part of the federal 
anti-crime programme approved by the president. The government 
plans to spend about five trillion roubles to implement it, 
hoping to receive back twice as much. 
  The programme largely expands the rights of law enforcement 
bodies and provides for a greater role of counterintelligence in 
fighting organised crime in Russia. Counterintelligence service 
leaders said they will set up a special body to take active 
measures to combat the rising wave of crime and will act in 
cooperation with other crime-fighting organisations. Similar 
bodies are planned to be set up in several big Russian cities, 
including Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk. 
  On Tuesday, President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree giving 
Russia's police new powers to fight organised crime which has 
been lately terrorising most Russian cities. 
  To prevent possible criticism of the decree, a high-ranking 
Russian counterintelligence official said earlier today that the 
decree does not infringe upon civil right and curbs only the 
rights of criminal groupings. Yevgeniy Savostyanov, head of the 
counterintelligence service in Moscow and the Moscow region, 
said that the decree aims at protecting the population of Russia 
from organised crime. "The adopted measures limit only the 
rights of the members of criminal gangs and their direct 
accomplices," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with psychiatrist-narcologist L.V. Pushkareva by </F>
Inessa Lasovskaya in Novosibirsk, under the rubric "Stay 
Healthy!"; date not given: "Alas, Drug Addicts Learn Only From 
Their Own Experience"] 
  [Text] The number of children and teenagers 
registered by drug rehabilitation clinics because of a addiction 
to alcohol, drugs, and toxic substances has increased by a 
factor of more than two in our city. 
  The narcologists and the mayoralty committee for youth 
affairs believe inviting both children and parents to a meeting 
at the imeni October Revolution House of Culture at 1500 on 8 
June to be one of the measures to hamper the spread of this 
teenage "epidemic." They planned to show a very interesting film 
which clarifies many points, and to comment on what the film 
narrates and what happens to those who are brought up on the 
street. Physician-narcologists will present answers that are 
easy for children to understand to all the complex questions 
that are asked from the floor. 
  As we announce this event and deeply appreciate the anxiety 
of the public, we offer for your attention an interview with 
psychiatrist-narcologist Larisa Vladimirovna Pushkareva, chief 
of the adolescent ward of the municipal city drug rehabilitation 
clinic. 
  Lasovskaya: Larisa Vladimirovna, how does it still 
happen that adults living side by side with a teenager do not 
notice that they have a real drug addict in the family? 
  Pushkareva: This happens when attention is paid to 
the children only in a pro forma manner: They are fed and 
clothed. Upbringing means work and responsibility. One cannot 
shift this direct duty to others. Depraved inclinations develop 
out of a lack of occupation; many cling to "their own" groups 
and packs just because they have nothing to do. They go to 
"their own" kind because of a lack of understanding from adults. 
Their parents are seldom their friends and advisers; more 
frequently they act as prosecutors. Meanwhile, adolescents have 
their own problems. A girl fell in love, and the boy dumped her. 
This is a tragedy for her. A girlfriend makes her an offer: 
"Here, take this, you will feel better." Perhaps this girl, 
having gotten used to the regular use of the "tranquilizer," 
will pity some other person. You and I may not know how drugs 
are distributed, but they know! 
  Lasovskaya: One gets the impression that 
modern-day children have no notion of the danger in which they 
are putting their lives. Among those whom you begin to treat, is 
there not a single person who has discussed this topic with 
adults? 
  Pushkareva: Why not? About 30 percent have been 
forced to listen to admonitions from their mothers and fathers. 
However, like fools, they learn from their own experience, 
although these children are far from stupid, rather the other 
way around. 
  Lasovskaya: It is clear as far as they are 
concerned, but what about the parents? Why do they fail to see 
deviations in the behavior of their children? Or are the signs 
of drug addiction imperceptible? 
  Pushkareva: It is precisely the point that they 
leap out at you. The toxic substance addict altogether reeks of 
glue from three kilometers away. Both drug addicts and nascent 
alcoholics cannot conceal mounting aggression, nor do they want 
to conceal it. Love in children alternates with hate. How is 
this normal? And what about a puffy face? What about memory 
loss? What about strange burns and skin lesions? They 
deliberately slit their skin; for them, this is a technique for 
the infusion of intoxicating preparations. They have bruises 
along their veins, they behave as if they were drunk, but there 
is no smell. Is this easy to overlook? However, many parents 
display unsoundness even on learning of the disease. We are the 
ones trying to convince them: It is not coming to us that is 
shameful, but failing to have your child treated. Or else they 
bring their children and sort of dump them on us: "Do what you 
want. Treat them any way you know how, but we cannot do anything 
any more." 
  Lasovskaya: In general, you are not discussing 
your work in the mass media in vain. By all signs, your work has 
picked up in response to the growth of adolescent drug addiction 
and the crime it entails. We have an opportunity to give a 
telephone number which people may call for your advice. 
  Pushkareva: The telephone number is 23-48-14. Ask 
for me, Larisa Vladimirovna. At the reception office of the 
clinic they will immediately understand what will be discussed. 
Recently we separated from the city adolescent narcological 
complex which had an inpatient facility and a chain of 
outpatient facilities. 
  Lasovskaya: Support from the public is needed for 
the efforts of adolescent narcologists to rescue perishing 
children. Do you encounter indifference most often nonetheless? 
  Pushkareva: It is easier for me to answer by 
giving favorable examples. We have invited parents, teachers, 
guardians, adolescents, and members of commissions for minors' 
affairs for a meeting on 8 June at a large auditorium (holding 
500 people). So, Kalininskiy Rayon has even made arrangements 
for its own bus to bring in all those who wish to come, and this 
is characteristic of them! Central Rayon accommodates us in all 
our endeavors; it is easy to work with any representative of the 
rayon administration there. I hope that such examples will be 
much more numerous. 
<H8>  *** </H8>
  Like all adolescent narcologists of the city, Larisa 
Vladimirovna Pushkareva handles three times the regular 
workload, and not just because this is virtually a new specialty 
for physicians which has been occasioned by our new, utterly 
debauched times. When there was strict morality there were 
modest children and plain pediatricians. Then the immoral video 
conditioning for depraved inclinations appeared, and the pattern 
of assistance to children by physicians changed: Children are 
now treated by venereal disease specialists and narcologists. 
They are already taking up functions which are not properly 
theirs: Distracted from the treatment process, they go to youth 
audiences to meet potential patients and call things by their 
proper names, or try to talk some sense into parents: Please 
understand that the departure of a child from the family and 
preoccupation with "grass" are paths toward tragedy. Adolescent 
drug addiction (alcoholism, toxic substance addiction) is a new 
mass disease which is transmitted through the social milieu, 
through the communication of children. It should be perceived 
precisely as a disease--that is, your own and other children 
alike should be protected against it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Dzhemal Dzhanashiya, head of the </F>
National Bureau for Combating Drug Addiction and the Drugs 
Business, by Nina Abgarova; place and date not given: "Dzhemal 
Dzhanashiya: `The Main Thing Is That We've Got 
Started....'"--introduction and all questions published in 
boldface] 
  [Text] The wave of drug addiction that has hit the whole 
world has not spared Georgia, either. According to the most 
modest calculations, the number of drug addicts in the republic 
has exceeded 200,000. Approximately 10 percent of these are 
women and teenagers. In addition to the fact that Georgia is of 
interest to the drugs mafia as a country that is advantageously 
located for the transit of drugs, there is one more alarming 
fact: An internal market is springing up in the republic for 
the manufacture and sale of plant-based drugs. 
  In order to implement comprehensive measures aimed at 
preventing drug addiction and also further strengthen the fight 
against drug addiction and the drugs business, by a decree of 
the head of state, the National Bureau for Combating Drug 
Addiction and the Drugs Business has been created on the basis 
of a similar department in the republic's Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. By order of the minister of internal affairs, Colonel 
Dzhemal Dzhanashiya has been appointed head of the bureau. We 
direct the reader's attention to a conversation that we had with 
him. 
  Abgarova: Batono [Georgian polite form of 
address] Dzhemal, how do you explain the unprecedented increase 
in drug addiction in Georgia? 
  Dzhanashiya: The surge in drug addiction can be 
observed not only in Georgia. The whole world has been infected 
with this illness. This is a matter of constant concern for all 
the CIS countries. The representatives of the law enforcement 
agencies of the former Soviet republics have become convinced 
that illegal drug dealing has reached a menacing scale. In 
Russia alone, 15 tonnes of various drugs were confiscated during 
the last year. Unfortunately, we are also confronted with some 
sad statistics: The number of drug addicts that have been 
officially registered is 4,000, but in reality there are far 
more. At the last conference of representatives from the CIS 
countries, which was held in Moscow, it was decided to combine 
efforts in the fight against drug addiction, establish ties with 
one another, and, what is most important, combat this evil 
professionally. However, here in Georgia, virtually nothing has 
been done in this direction of late. Furthermore, we have even 
lost those positive things that we had. People used to come to 
Georgia to hold consultations and exchange experience: Our 
system of controlling drug addiction and the interaction between 
our health protection and law enforcement bodies served as an 
example to many. However, the main thing now is to get started. 
The National Bureau will also serve these aims. 
  Abgarova: What are the immediate tasks that you 
are setting your bureau? 
  Dzhanashiya: The creation of special subunits 
that will combat illegal drug dealing. In principle, the tasks 
of these subunits have already been determined as groups engaged 
in the drugs business have already been formed and are 
functioning here in Georgia. These are, first and foremost, 
those that are dealing in plant-based drugs such as poppy stems 
(crack) [koknar] and marijuana that arrive here from Azerbaijan, 
Central Asia, the North Caucasus, and Krasnodarskiy Kray and 
also from the countries forming the "golden 
crescent"--Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan. These types of 
drugs present a big problem for Georgia and the CIS countries, 
even though the cost of these drugs is 250 times higher in 
Georgia than abroad. In view of the fact that these drugs need 
to be processed, underground laboratories have appeared in 
Georgia and also in Central Asia. The second group, which is 
composed in the main of tourists, is engaged in bringing into 
Georgia medical preparations and powerful drugs from India, 
Pakistan, and Singapore. 
  Those people who are occupied in producing plant-based drugs 
on the territory of Georgia present no less of a threat. Such 
people "work" in Svanetiya, Lagodekhi, the mountainous part of 
Samegrelo, Dusheti, Marneuli, Dmanisi, Bolnisi, and so forth. 
It is possible, for example, to buy without any problem hashish 
that comes from Mestiya or Khashy [khashiyskiy] in the market in 
Zugdidi. 
  Naturally, it is necessary to combat drug addiction at a 
high 
professional level. Unfortunately, a primitive approach is 
often adopted to this problem here: Capture the dealers and 
that's the end of it. However, the dealers are by no means the 
only ones responsible for bringing misfortune. While there is a 
demand, there will also be a market. This is common knowledge. 
In order to deal with the, let us say, "kings" of the drugs 
mafia, it is necessary to have the corresponding knowledge and 
be prepared. Therefore, one of the most important tasks for us 
now is to train our employees. The UN is allocating specific 
sums of money to all the CIS states in order to combat the drugs 
mafia and is also financing international seminars at which 
experts in this field can exchange experience and establish 
ties. For example, the department responsible for combating 
drug addiction in the United States has held such seminars, 
which I have attended. Our employees will shortly be going to 
Egypt, where a seminar is to be held, but this time it will 
involve practical work. Those attending will receive 
international certificates. It is essential for us to have at 
our disposal specialists who have been trained at the 
international level; in other words, we have to have the 
potential regarding personnel and then those organizations 
engaged in combating drug addiction throughout the world and, in 
particular, the UN program in this sphere will actively render 
us practical assistance. 
  Abgarova: What is the most important thing 
regarding cooperation between specialists and their mutual 
assistance in the struggle against the drugs business? 
  Dzhanashiya: Of course, the exchange of 
information on people involved in the drugs mafia. We in the 
CIS countries are planning to create a single bank of 
information on those involved in smuggling drugs. The exchange 
of such information will make everyone's work easier. Ties are 
being established with Interpol. In the future, we will be 
establishing ties with the employees of special services 
involved in combating drug addiction in other countries. I 
repeat that the supply and exchange of the latest information is 
very important for all countries in the world. An international 
center for training employees in the struggle against the drugs 
business will soon begin to function in Moscow. The center will 
operate under the aegis of the UN. Between 10 and 15 of our 
employees will be trained in this center every year. 
  Abgarova: Could you tell us in which Georgian 
towns drug addiction is most widespread? 
  Dzhanashiya: Tbilisi and then Gori, which was 
previously virtually unaffected by such a phenomenon. Drugs 
arrive here from Tskhinvali, where the situation is basically 
out of control. We are receiving the same information from 
Sukhumi. In general, however sad it may be, it is often being 
observed that Georgians are supplying Russia with drugs. In 
1993, in the Russian Federation alone, some 300 kg of drugs were 
confiscated from 250 residents of Georgia. One can imagine how 
large this figure will be on the scale of the CIS. Morphine is 
being brought into Moscow principally by our compatriots. Our 
bureau recently conducted an operation in which we unmasked a 
criminal group that also included women and was smuggling 
morphine from Tbilisi to Moscow. In the Mtatsminda rayon of 
Tbilisi, we also seized 60 so-called hashish pencils from a 
criminal group. 
  Abgarova: Can one say that state structures are 
involved in the drugs business here in Georgia? 
  Dzhanashiya: I do not possess such information. 
However, officials are fairly often involved with criminal 
groups and, what is most unpleasant, these include employees of 
the law enforcement agencies. 
  Abgarova: Nevertheless, one quite often hears the 
view that the drugs business cannot be defeated.... 
  Dzhanashiya: I do not agree with this view. One 
can and should fight against the drugs business. Drug addicts 
need to be treated--this is also a part of the struggle against 
the drugs business. The efficiency factor regarding the 
treatment of drug addicts here in Georgia is, as yet, equivalent 
to zero. This is all the more significant given that one cannot 
observe a trend toward a decline in the demand for drugs. 
Rather the reverse is true. Therefore, one has to combat demand 
as well. In the United States, for example, it is being brought 
home to children still in kindergarten that drugs mean death. 
Here, a new stage in the struggle against drug addiction is 
only just beginning. Therefore, we must all unite to achieve 
the common aim. Let me give you an example: This year, the 
U.S. Senate has allocated $18 billion for the needs of the 
special services engaged in combating drug addiction. I 
understand full well that our state is not in a position to 
allocate such sums. However, we do deserve basic assistance. 
Up to now, there has not even been any coordination with the 
customs service. There is no need to mention how important this 
service is for controlling the smuggling of drugs at customs 
points. Of no less significance is the problem of legally 
importing drugs into Georgia. I have in mind medical 
preparations that are being sent as humanitarian aid from 
different countries in the world. An inspectorate created 
within the Georgian Ministry of Health is working in this 
direction. Nevertheless, the support of leaders at the local 
level is needed; everyone has to work equally hard in this 
direction and then the drugs business in Georgia will not 
flourish. We are today working for the future. The main thing 
is that we've made a start and this is, as they say, the hardest 
part.

  [Text] The Kazakh Interior Ministry held an itinerant 
session in the village of Tolebi, Zhambyl oblast, devoted to 
curbing drug trafficking. As is widely known, cannabis grown in 
Zhambyl oblast is used to produce the most widely spread drugs 
hashish and marijuana. The session noted that drugs smuggling 
routes connect the Chu valley of South Kazakhstan with China, 
India, Afghanistan, Italy, and France. New methods in the 
battle against drugs smugglers were discussed.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 15, BNS -- A British citizen suspected 
in smuggling drugs has been detained on Lithuania's border with 
Poland. 
  Yu Tak Ching Gloria, a British citizen residing in Hong 
Kong, 
was detained by Lithuanian customs officials early Tuesday after 
a large quantity of unidentified medicaments was detected in her 
baggage. 
  The British tourist was carrying to Poland 23 brands of 
tablets and 7 brands of medical oils. After testing 6 brands, 
tablets of two of them tested heroin positive and another two 
proved to contain cocaine, according to the daily LIETUVOS 
RYTAS. Any final conclusions about the nature of the 
confiscated drugs have been put off until more thorough tests 
are carried out. 
  The British citizen has been detained for a three-day period 
by a sanction of the prosecutor of the Lazdijai district where 
the border checkpoint is located. Yu Tak Ching Gloria was 
advised to stay at the local hotel at her own expense. The 
British Embassy in Vilnius has been informed about the incident. 
  Two other residents of Hong Kong were detained at the 
Lazdijai border crossing earlier in the year carrying 
medications suspected to contain narcotic substances. Two women 
were detained in each of the previous cases, and both times more 
careful tests denied any suspicions. In all three cases, 
including the latest, the tourists claimed to be on the way from 
Helsinki to Germany. They had all successfully passed the other 
Baltic countries. 
  Illegal drugs trafficking businesses, are in search of new 
transit routes through Lithuanian territory, according to the 
Lithuanian Border Intelligence Service. It is speculated 
residents of Hong Kong and other Asian countries are sent via 
Lithuania with narcotic-like substances in order to test the 
watchfulness of Lithuanian customs services.

  [Text] The Ibero-American countries' battle against money 
laundering and drug trafficking capitals is targeting new paths. 
On 9 June, Colombia stressed the Ibero-American need to control 
bank accounts and investigate shady transactions and the 
recording of money transfers that exceed reasonable ceilings. 
Colombian experts, who proposed a bill to curtail this scourge, 
believe that the fight against money laundering must extend to 
gambling houses and casinos. The objective is to identify 
players and participants and to keep a numbered record of the 
operations. 
  The ministers and representatives of 20 countries, counseled 
by Spanish experts who have implemented several of the measures 
that are currently being multilaterally discussed, on 9 June 
analyzed the terms of a joint declaration, especially those 
regarding financial system controls. 
  EL TIEMPO posed some questions to the judicial authorities 
of 
a group of countries that are attending the ministers summit, 
which will end on 10 June, and is publishing their opinions and 
proposals on fighting money laundering. In principle, the 
prospects of multilateral money laundering agreements reportedly 
will be fully supported by each nation's legislature. 
<H5>  Mexican Deputy Prosecutor General Ricardo Franco </H5>
  Mexico is currently studying a strategy aimed at locating 
moneys illegally entered or transferred. The objective is to 
zero in on the moneys that come from drug trafficking through 
the cooperation of banks and the operations that authorities 
performed in the bank accounts themselves. 
  Those who commit illegal enrichment will be prosecuted and 
sentenced, on average, to 18 years in prison. The solution to 
this problem lies in reinforcing investigations and broadening 
cooperation among the nations to standardize procedures and 
prosecute criminals. 
  Mexico is acting with the law on its side to conduct a 
head-on fight against drug trafficking and will not hesitate to 
punish those who are involved in any activity related to this 
vice. 
<H5>  Chilean Justice Minister Maria Soledad Alvear </H5>
  Chile is about to approve a bill to drastically penalize 
illicit drug trafficking activities, such as money laundering. 
It is even necessary to study the possibility of lifting bank 
secrecy laws, rendering harsh sentences, and expediting legal 
procedures in those cases where there irregular money 
transactions are detected. 
  In our country, we have reached a consensus on moving 
forward 
with drug legislation, although there are certain sectors that 
oppose bank secrecy violations. 
<H5>  Argentine Justice Minister Jorge Luis Maiorano </H5>
  Argentina is equipped with the necessary juridical 
instruments to combat money laundering through actions 
coordinated with the banking system in order to detect, for 
instance, irregular bank account transfers by businesses or 
individuals. 
  In addition, all government bodies have the political 
resolve 
to avoid the proliferation of this affliction. A cooperation 
effort should be implemented in Ibero-America. There is also 
modern legislation on the subject, legislation that carries 
prison terms of up to eight years minimum, forbids prison 
releases, and empowers judges and the Justice Ministry to 
intervene as irregular transactions are detected and confirmed. 
<H5>  Bolivian Justice Minister Rene Blatman </H5>
  In Bolivia, we are holding a number of seminars with banks 
and are drafting a bill to fight money laundering. Our belief 
is that it must be a joint effort among the international 
community. Isolated efforts are destined to fail. 
  Two viable mechanisms, which should be adopted by the 
region, 
to curtail this illegal activity are the lifting of bank secrecy 
laws on suspicious accounts and the creation of formulas to 
justify money sources. 
<H5>  Spanish Justice Minister Teresa Fernandez </H5>
  Spain has adopted criminal and administrative measures to 
prevent capital flight and money laundering, such as setting 
ceilings on cash payments, exerting larger loan controls, and 
storing operations records for up to five years. In addition, 
the Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office was created and is 
authorized to request information from banks. 
  Money laundering is one of the practices that has provided 
oxygen tanks to drug traffickers. This is why I believe 
Ibero-America must adopt measures of this nature to halt money 
laundering. 
<H5>  Cuban Justice Minister Carlos Amat Florez </H5>
  We have not faced the situation generated by drug 
traffickers' investments, because we had a closed economy in 
Cuba. Since we opened our economy, we have been receiving 
foreign aid through agreements with the Cuban Government. 
However, we have been careful and are thoroughly investigating 
and scrutinizing the sources of capital.

  [Excerpt] Belem -- Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim 
yesterday requested that rich countries supply greater resources 
with which to fight narcotics trafficking. He made this request 
at a news conference held after delivering his closing speech at 
the 24th OAS General Assembly in this, the capital city of Para 
State. Amorim noted that because funding for drug enforcement 
operations is very limited in Brazil, it is very important for 
our country to receive financial cooperation from countries 
where drugs are consumed. 
  Amorim said: Drug producing countries are receiving 
resources to implement alternative crops. Yet countries that 
are being used as drug routes have not received the same kind of 
support. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Iquique (Chile), 16 Jun (EFE) -- The need to fight 
against drug trafficking and consumption and the replacement of 
coca plantations in Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru through 
international aid are the proposals the Latin American 
Parliament (Parlatino) began to debate today, 16 June. 
  The meeting began today in the Chilean port of Iquique, 
1,857 
Km north of Santiago, and will end tomorrow, 17 June, with the 
release of conclusions on subjects such as drug trafficking, the 
foreign debt, energy and mines, economic matters, and 
international law. 
  Bolivian Deputy Guido Camacho, president of the 
Antinarcotics 
Defense Commission [Comision de Defensa en la Lucha Contra el 
Narcotrafico], told EFE that the international community must 
participate in coca replacement policies in Colombia, Peru, and 
Bolivia, given that this agricultural product generates revenues 
in those countries. 
  He said there is the legal consumption of coca, especially 
by 
Bolivian and Peruvian peasants as part of their daily diet. 
  The Parlatino members pointed out that excess coca goes for 
the production of cocaine, which leads to drug trafficking. 
  Camacho added that measures must be adopted to prevent this 
from happening. Enforcement policies must be reinforced with 
preventive measures, related to the need to replace the coca 
plantations with alternative crops. 
  This must be done within a plan to improve highway 
infrastructure and other measures to pave the way for a more 
adequate trade of agricultural products, Deputy Camacho said. 
  He added that the proposal to legalize the use of cocaine in 
Colombia will be discussed at the meetings to be held on Friday. 
  Among the proposals is one submitted by Chile demanding 
punishment for drug traffickers and also for consumers. 
  When asked about the validity of the conclusions released by 
the Parlatino for the governments, the Bolivian deputy explained 
that the resolutions will be approved by consensus of the 
Parlatino members who will then take these ideas to the 
congresses of their respective countries to turn them into laws.

  [Text] While thousands of people were arriving in Florida 
[department] to participate in the San Cono pilgrimage, an 
enormous truck carrying a bulky cargo arrived at the Florida 
Free Zone [near the town of Piedra Alta]. It was carrying the 
first prefabricated Russian helicopter to arrive here. The 
helicopter will be meticulously assembled in the customs area. 
  The Ka-32 helicopter, which was used by the Soviet Army 
during the invasion of Afghanistan, is now being offered to 
several governments because of its excellent maneuverability and 
efficiency. 
  Imaribo S.A., headed by George Bitar and Alex 
Grebenchtchykov, has negotiated the sale of several of these 
helicopters to South American countries. 
  To improve the operation, the enterprise is installed within 
the Florida Free Zone, where the helicopters will be fully 
assembled by seven Russian engineers who will reside in the city 
of Piedra Alta. 
  Luis Calachi is in charge of the free zone. He told EL 
OBSERVADOR that each helicopters costs $2.5 million and that 
Imaribo S.A. intends to build an assembly plant in the free zone 
to assemble the helicopters that are sold in this region of 
America. 
  The container in which these helicopters are shipped is the 
size of six 20-foot containers. The first arrived on 3 June and 
was escorted by Transport and Public Works Ministry officials. 
  The Ka-32 marked a new stage in the development and 
manufacturing of helicopters in Russia. This version is used to 
transport cargo in its hold and its outside winch can be used in 
the construction, mounting, and stringing of electricity power 
lines. This helicopter is also useful for ocean oil rigs, 
salvage operations, and to transport sick people. 
  The helicopter that arrived on 3 June has already been sold 
to Peru. This unit may be used in the fight against drug 
trafficking or against the Shining Path organization. The 
Uruguayan Army supplied a crane to help unload the container. 
  This type of helicopter can be assembled in three days. 
Other containers are due to arrive in Florida because sales 
have been made to other countries in the region.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Court sources reported 
today that Peruvian citizen Jorge Diaz Reategui, who was 
detained a week ago in the Argentine city of Tucuman, has 
admitted being a former member of the Shining Path Maoist group. 
  In a joint operation on 9 June, Tucuman police and Argentine 
Federal Police detained Diaz Reategui, 36, at a hotel in 
Tucuman, 1,412 km northwest of Buenos Aires. He had been 
meeting with 10 fellow countrymen, who managed to escape. 
  Tucuman Federal Judge Ricardo Maturana, who is hearing the 
case, asked the Interpol office in Peru to deny or confirm Diaz 
Reategui's testimony. 
  The sources noted: "Diaz Reategui coordinated his visit with 
his followers. They probably crossed the border on forged 
certificates of residence and visas from Paraguay to Argentina, 
via Buenos Aires, from where they traveled to other provincial 
capitals like Cordoba, Jujuy, Salta, and Tucuman." 
  The court sources added that the Peruvian Upper Huallaga 
region, where the former Shining Path member was operating, "is 
a region where the world's largest coca plantations exist, a 
region where cocaine paste is processed and subsequently refined 
for marketing by the Colombian `cartels.'" 
  The Argentine Federal Police Press Division added that the 
Shining Path cell, of which Diaz Reategui was a member, "had 
been tracked for about one year." 
  The Tucuman police are still tracking the other 10 people 
who 
accompanied Diaz Reategui on the day of his arrest and are 
attempting to determine what the former Shining Path member and 
his followers were doing in Tucuman and in other provinces.

  Tajik customs officers seized a big haul of narcotics worth 
96 million rubles at the Nizhnepyandzh check point on the 
Tajik-Afghan border. An Afghan citizen wanted to smuggle six

  Three people were charged on 19 June with conspiracy to 
supply crack cocaine after a police raid netted one of the 
biggest seizures of the dangerous drug yet made in Britain. Six 
kilograms of crack with an estimated worth of 1.2 million 
British pounds were found after the raid at an address in the 
West End of London on the night of 17 June. Andre N'Guessan, 33, 
of Bryanston Square in the West End, Charles Oppon, 34, of 
Plummer Road, Streatham and Maxime Keiti, 29, whose address is 
not known, are to be charged. Four other people were arrested 
but were released on police bail until July and August. Police 
believe they have intercepted a major international 
manufacturing and distribution network for the drug. The 
operation, carried out by the south east regional crime squad, 
was the culmination of 18 months of work. (London PRESS

Laundering and Legalization of Soft Drugs -- Iran Criticizes 
Swiss Policy"] 
  [Text] Courmayeur, 20 Jun (ATS) -- A UN conference on money 
laundering ruled out the liberalization of soft drugs. The head 
of the Iranian delegation criticized the Swiss and the 
Netherlands policies on this issue. 
  Luciano Violante, vice president of the Italian Parliament, 
had proposed to liberalize soft drugs like hashish. Such a 
measure, he said, would facilitate the fight against the mafia. 
Argentine's Adolfo Beria, president of the UN Council for the 
fight against crime, explained that the conference had rejected 
this proposal. 
  "In the name of Allah," the Iranian delegate, Mehdi 
Mirafzai, 
strongly condemned any liberalization. He expressed his deep 
concern over the ongoing legalization processes in several 
countries, particularly in Switzerland and in the Netherlands. 
He called for a survey which should assess the effects of the 
liberalization of drugs on the fight against money laundering.

reports on drug seizures and arrests related to drug trafficking 
monitored through 23 June. 
<H5>  Argentina </H5>
  On 16 June, the Federal Police dismantled a gang of 
traffickers led by a woman known as "La Cholita." This happened 
during an operation in the city of Salvador de Jujuy. The 
police also seized two kg of very pure cocaine that was to have 
been sold in Buenos Aires, Cordoba, and other major cities. 
(Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 2206 GMT 16 Jun 94) 
  On 17 June, Federal Police personnel arrested Federal Police 
NCO Teodoro Jesus Navarro and Paraguayan citizens Rodolfo 
Ibarrola and Ruben Taboada who were carrying two kg of very pure 
cocaine. The seizure came during a check on a bus on the 
Panamericana highway in the Buenos Aires District of San Isidro. 
(Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 2118 GMT 17 Jun 94) 
  The Federal Police have dismantled a powerful gang of 
traffickers that sent cocaine to Europe. The forces seized 210 
kg of very pure cocaine and arrested 30 persons following four 
years of thorough investigation that included seven operations 
in Buenos Aires and abroad. Argentine citizens Juan Carlos 
Rocha, 34, and Luis Horacio Tust, 63, are among the detainees. 
(Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 1526 GMT 22 Jun 94) 
  The Federal Police have seized an important amount of 
cocaine 
and marijuana and arrested 17 people during operations in many 
parts of the countries in the past few hours. The forces 
arrested two people carrying 4.5 kg of cocaine in Tucuman 
Province. The detainees are members of a gang that brought 
approximately five5 kg of cocaine per month from Bolivia. Moron 
police personnel arrested 10 people and confiscated 2.5 kg of 
cocaine during various operations in the west part of the Buenos 
Aires urban area. Police Precinct No. 48 agents arrested a 
couple carrying 250 grams of very pure cocaine. The Federal 
Police seized 3.8 kg of marijuana and arrested two people in 
Posadas. They also confiscated 0.5 kg of cocaine and arrested 
one person in the city of Comodoro Rivadavia, Chubut Province. 
(Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 2154 GMT 22 Jun 94) 
<H5>  Bolivia </H5>
  Agents of the Special Antinarcotics Force, FELCN, have 
arrested Martin Cadima Inturias and five other people and seized 
43.3 kg of cocaine during a raid at a house in the Juan Pablo II 
neighborhood, in Santa Cruz. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 8 
Jun 94 p 13) 
  On 10 June, FELCN personnel arrested an unidentified driver 
and seized 15 kg of drugs during a raid at his house in the 
township of Sacaba, 14 km east of the city of Cochabamba. FELCN 
departmental chief General Hugo Guarachi termed the arrest 
"important" because if could lead to the discovery of a ring of 
traffickers. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish National Section 10 
Jun 94 p 2) 
  Colonel Armando Figueredo, FELCN departmental commander in 
Chapare, on 7 Jun stated that traffickers have reportedly chosen 
the city of El Alto to install a new cocaine crystalization 
center and a center to distribute drugs to neighboring 
countries. He said they reached this conclusion after many 
antidrug operations in the area in the past few months in which 
they detected Peruvian traffickers apparently "working" with 
local traffickers. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 8 Jun 94 p 7) 
  During May, the FELCN burned 1,671 grams of cocaine 
hydrochloride and 6,280 grams of cocaine sulfate and arrested 
six people, including two Peruvian citizens. FELCN Commander 
Figueredo said the drugs were confiscated during three 
operations in the cities of La Paz and El Alto. (La Paz HOY in 
Spanish 8 Jun 94 p 15) 
  An official poll on drug consumption in 11 Bolivian cities, 
in which 6,000 people were interviewed, showed that 37.9 percent 
of the urban population believe it is easy or very easy to 
obtain drugs for consumption, 41.6 percent said it is difficult 
or very difficult, and 20.5 percent said they did not know. The 
poll indicates that 56.3 percent of consumers and 46.7 percent 
of non-consumers believe consumption is increasing. Only 13.6 
percent and 13.3 percent of each group, respectively, said this 
problem declined in the cities. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 13 
Jun 94 p A3) 
<H5>  Brazil </H5>
  On 20 June, Federal Police personnel arrested Netherlander 
Monika Van Der Linde, 24, and seized 5.5 kg of very pure cocaine 
at the Manaus international airport. The drug was hidden in her 
clothing. Federal Police delegate Carlos Cohen thinks she 
belongs to the same gang as Netherlander trafficker Daniel Van 
Der Terk, who was arrested on 7 April. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA O 
ESTADO in Portuguese 1826 GMT 21 Jun 94) 
<H5>  Peru </H5>
  Tumbes National Police agents have arrested Paulino Huaman 
Montalban, 40, Enrique Carranza Valderrama, 33, Dionisio Sanchez 
Pena, 22, Augencio Villa Santa, 28, and Lucio Segura Carranza, 
23, and seized 9.4 kg of cocaine paste as they were about to 
enter Ecuador across the international bridge. (Lima EL COMERCIO 
in Spanish 7 Jun 94 p A10) 
  Under the pretext of manufacturing and repairing car 
batteries, 21 firms from Huancayo bought chemicals that were 
then sent to the Upper Huallaga to process cocaine paste. The 
firms each purchased 1,000 to 1,500 kg of sulphuric acid. 
Antidrug Division, Dinandro, personnel arrested 13 battery 
dealers and closed 16 firms. Charges of diverting chemicals for 
drug trafficking were filed against Juan Lopez Osorio, Iris 
Palomares Ramos, Miriam Rojas Albinagorta, Julio Rojas 
Albinagorta, Hugo Rojas Navarro, Javier Rojas Albinagorta, Elmer 
Castillo Gomez, Maria Chamorro Palomino, Wilmer Castillo Gomez, 
Eleuterio Castillo Gomez, Mequia Rojas Orellana, and Braulio 
Aquiles Uriarte Ramos. A police operation also led to the 
seizure of 2,479 kg of sulphuric acid. (Lima EL COMERCIO in 
Spanish 9 Jun 94 p A10) 
  On 12 June, police agents arrested Pedro Ramirez Rios, 46, 
Liliana Koo Quispe, 28, William Verastegui Britos, 34, and Pedro 
Vascones Vega, 39, and seized 1.6 kg of very pure cocaine 
hydrochloride during a raid of a house in San Martin de Porres 
District, Lima. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 14 Jun 94 p A11) 
  Highway police personnel arrested Johnson Arrotea Maylle, 
25, 
and seized 1.1 kg of cocaine paste during a check on a bus at km 
100 of the Central Highway, in Matucana. The drug was concealed 
inside a pumpkin. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 16 Jun 94 p A13) 
  On 13 June, Lima National Police personnel arrested five 
people and seized a total of 3.6 kg of cocaine paste and 150 
grams of cocaine hydrochloride during a check on two buses 
coming from Tingo Maria and Huanuco. The detainees are Maria 
Bernal Aguirre, 23, and her brother Elmer; Maximiliano Celestino 
Villar, 32; Leonor Julia Rodriguez Villon, 38; and Victor Copia 
Hoyos, 22. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 16 Jun 94 p A17) 
  Custom police personnel seized more than 36 kg of cocaine as 
it was about to be shipped for Florida, USA. The drug valued at 
more than $3 million was placed at the disposal of Dinandro. 
Three people were arrested including a customs agent. (Lima

<F P=106> [Article by Pauline Seymour: "FNM: Bahamas Will Not Be Haven </F>
for Those in Drug Trade"] 
  [Text] Works Minister Frank Watson told Parliament April 13 
that the FNM government will not give comfort to persons 
involved in drug smuggling, money laundering or any activities 
related to the drug trade. 
  Mr Watson was debating the Extradition Bill, which passed 
the 
House Wednesday, April 13. 
  Mr Watson said one of the most serious indictments to be 
levelled at the previous PLP administration was its acquiescence 
in the level of disrespect and disregard by citizens for the 
law, rules and regulations of Bahamian society. 
  The PLP administration, for whatever reason, failed to 
uphold 
the laws and regulations of the Bahamas in an extremely 
permissive atmosphere where disrespect for law is rampant and 
widespread, said Mr Watson. 
  In the mid-1980s the country reached the point where there 
were leaders who could not distinguish between right and wrong. 
  Today, Mr Watson said, the Bahamas, which was once a safe 
and 
tranquil society, is reaping a storm of discontent, much of 
which has its roots in more than a decade of permissiveness. 
  "Well," Mr Watson said, "no society can long survive in an 
atmosphere where rules of human conduct are more often observed 
in the breach thereof." 
  Social advancement and economic growth can only occur when 
conditions are conducive to their development, he said. 
  "There must be tranquillity. There must be order, and rules 
for the conduct of human affairs must be observed by and 
enforced among all citizens in a fair and impartial manner," Mr 
Watson said. 
  Mr Watson said government must take the lead in reversing 
the 
permissiveness. The Extradition Bill, he said, is necessary to 
give effect to the terms of the extradition treaty between the 
United States and the Bahamas. 
  The FNM government, he said, is not breaking new ground 
through the Extradition Bill. The treaty, he said, was 
negotiated long before the FNM came to office. The party's duty, 
he said, is to keep a commitment that the PLP government made to 
the United States. 
  Mr Watson said the measures contained in the Bill are not 
inconsistent with the FNM's philosophy. Over the years the FNM 
has made it clear that it will not give comfort to those who 
engage in drug smuggling, money laundering or are in any way 
connected with the drug trade. 
  Every individual against whom extradition is sought must 
have 
his case heard in a Bahamian court of law, Mr Watson said. The 
court must find, based on the evidence presented, that the 
individual has a case to answer, as is the procedure under the 
Bahamas system. 
  "The treaty state," he said, "must satisfy the Bahamian 
court 
that they are in possession of information against the accused 
which would constitute a crime in the Bahamas before the order 
may be issued." 
  If there is any mistake or a sell out of Bahamians, Mr 
Watson 
said, then the sell out was perpetrated by the former PLP 
administration when it entered into the extradition treaty with 
the United States. 
  The PLP, he said, entered into the treaty in 1990 and should 
have made its terms public a long time ago. 
  "This country has paid and continues to pay a heavy price 
for 
reneging on agreements freely entered into by the previous 
administration," Mr Watson said. 
  No one else will suffer because the government did not take 
appropriate measures to stamp out drug trafficking or any of the 
related activities or to honour an agreement, Mr Watson said. 
  He reminded Parliament of headlines such as "Nation For 
Sale" 
(THE MIAMI HERALD) and "Paradise Lost" (SUNDAY TIMES of London), 
which were published in 1984. 
  Mr Watson said the United States government did not trust 
the 
PLP administration. 
  Although the treaty was negotiated in 1990, he said, no 
effort was made to implement the provisions and it could not be 
effected without enabling legislation. 
  In addition, he said, in one court alone there are scores of 
appeals pending against prison sentences imposed by magistrates 
in drug-related cases dating back to 1989. However, the appeals 
cannot be heard because the transcripts are not available. 
  As a result, Mr Watson said, dozens of drug smugglers walk 
the streets as free men.

  [Text] More cannabis has been seized in 1994 than in 
the last five years--put together, shock figures show. 
  The drug confiscations mark a major triumph for Customs 
officers and Police. 
  But they also ring alarm bells over the amount of drugs 
being 
channelled into the Island. 
  "There have been a few large seizures this year--much larger 
than normal," said Police spokeswoman Sgt. Roseanda Jones. 
  Recently a staggering 500 lb haul of marijuana--worth $12 
million--was confiscated, she added. 
  "It looks as though we are heading for a record year." 
  Sgt. Jones went on to say there was evidence of more young 
people getting involved in drugs. 
  Figures show 324 kilos of cannabis have been seized between 
January 1 and April 11--a larger haul than in any of the eight 
previous years. 
  It compares, for instance, with just 22 kilos in 1993. 
  The kilo amounts for previous four years were: 135 (1992); 
24 
(1991); 76 (1990); and 60 (1989). 
  Added up, the weight for 1989-93 comes to 317 kilos of 
cannabis--seven less than in little over three months this year. 
  Statistics, in kilos, for the years back to 1982 show: 42 
(1988); 36 (1987); 74 (1986); 495 (1985); 557 (1984); 644 
(1983); and 188 (1982). 
  Most of the cannabis was seized by Customs officers--either 
at the Airport or docks. 
  Collector of Customs Mr. Gerry Ardis said: "We have made a 
substantial amount of seizures this year. 
  "It is certainly a larger amount than in any comparable 
period in previous years." 
  But he cautioned against reading too much into the figures. 
  "I would be very loathe to say just because we have seized 
more marijuana a trend is developing." 
  Mr. Ardis accepted, however, the confiscations were a 
triumph 
of tough training. 
  "Certainly over the last five years there has been intense 
training in drug interdiction. 
  "We also have many detection systems in place, and they are 
bearing fruit." 
  Mr. Ardis said most drugs came through or from the United 
States. 
  Sgt. Jones explained drug seizures could be linked to a 
number of factors. 
  These included one or two major seizures bumping up the 
statistics, and better drug detection. 
  Cannabis is also more bulky than other drugs, and difficult 
to conceal. 
  Sgt. Jones went on to point out: "The statistics are not 
really showing how much of a percentage of drugs we are seizing." 
  "Right now many people are involved in importing drugs. The 
dynamics have changed a lot over the years. 
  "We are getting many people involved, including more young 
people." 
  Sgt. Jones explained drug seizures used to be made up of a 
joint squad of Customs officers and Policemen. 
  They worked together at the Airport and the docks. 
  But this system was ended in May 1992, and now Customs 
officers take on the main responsibility. 
  "Police officers have been cut back in this area. I would 
say 
Customs officers are in the front line now of interdiction." 
  Sgt. Jones said it was felt Customs were best-placed to 
detect contraband. 
  It is not just cannabis, however, that is troubling Police. 
  Police have also voiced fears about a sharp increase in 
violent crime being linked to a heroin comeback. 
  The number of armed robberies over the past three months has 
already doubled figures for the same period last year. 
  It is thought drug addicts desperate for a "fix" resort to 
crime.

  [Text] Facts on 8 June proved the existence of a political 
agreement between the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] 
and the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] in the 
narcolinks [alleged MIR involvement with drug traffickers] 
investigations. The politicians involved later secretly 
confirmed the agreement. The details of this agreement, which is 
beginning to yield results, remain unknown. 
  MIR legislators told HOY about the agreement with the MNR 
for 
the purpose of obtaining a "lenient report" regarding the 
"narcolinks" subject in exchange for support to impeach two 
Supreme Court justices. 
  Two legislators, who asked not to be identified, said they 
were "disappointed" with the development of the investigation 
that, according to them, was supposed to "clearly determine" 
that the MIR leaders charged with being involved with drug 
traffickers were not guilty. 
  Moreover, MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] Deputy Juan del 
Granado 
admitted the existence of "regretful evidence that non-legal 
matters related to the impeachment process are being used" in 
the "narcolinks" investigations currently under way. 
  The agreement, which was a mere rumor until now, became 
obvious on 8 June when MIR Senators Leopoldo Lopez, Jose Luis 
Carvajal, and Gonzalo Valda reappeared at the impeachment 
sessions despite their announcement that they wouldn't even 
endorse it with their presence. 
  What is more, MIR Deputy Hugo Carvajal announced that his 
party would vote in favor of sentencing the court justices. 
  Moreover, a few hours later, MIR legislators approved the 
education reform bill that had been approved by the Chamber of 
Deputies, after voting against it in previous sessions. 
  According to MIR leaders, the narcolinks subject "was 
handled 
shamefully" through an agreement whose details still are unknown. 
  According to Deputy del Granado, one of the main 
protagonists 
of the investigation, there are clues that lead one to believe 
in the existence of some sort of agreement between the MNR and 
the MIR. 
  Among them, he mentioned the delay in drafting the final 
report, which should have been ready several days ago, but oddly 
enough is constantly postponed. Del Granado said: "This is 
very suspicious." 
  Del Granado said that in addition to this, there is the 
little conviction shown by Senator Gonzalo Valda when he sought 
an injunction preventing the enforcement of Resolution 113-94 
allowing the alternate senators to occupy the seats of those 
senators objected to by [Supreme Court Justices Ernesto] Poppe 
and [Edgar] Oblitas' defense. 
  There is also a numeric issue that would "justify" a MNR-MIR 
agreement. Two-thirds of the Senate's votes--18--are necessary 
to condemn the court justices. Since the governing coalition 
does not have that number of votes, the announcement by Carvajal 
could be feasible. 
  Although the agreement's exact terms have not been leaked, 
sources consulted by HOY said it is allegedly designed on one 
hand to obtain the most lenient report possible on the 
"narcolinks," and the MIR in exchange would give its support to 
the impeachment process, the education reform bill's approval, 
and constitutional reform. 
  When asked about the subject, Condepa [Conscience of the 
Fatherland] leader Carlos Palenque said: "It would be terrible 
for democracy and the political organizations involved."

  [Excerpt] The rumors spread during the past few days 
referring to alleged negotiations between the MNR [Nationalist 
Revolutionary Movement] and the MIR [Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left] were denied by the two parties' 
representatives, although with different arguments. 
  Communications Minister Ernesto Machicado, MIR Senator 
Gonzalo Valda, and MIR Deputy Hugo Carvajal said the version of 
the alleged agreement between the two parties, supposedly to 
"tone down" the report on "narcolinks" in exchange for support 
to sentence the Supreme Court justices, were mere rumors. 
  Carvajal believes the rumors spread by some MNR groups seek 
to discredit Constitutional Committee Chairman Edil Sandoval to 
force him and other deputies to act "aggressively" against the 
MIR. 
  Carvajal added: "An effort is being made for the purpose of 
demonstrating the existence of alleged negotiations, probably 
due to disagreements among some MNR groups that seek to 
discredit and disqualify the performance of Edil Sandoval, 
probably to prevent him from continuing to behave as objectively 
as he has done so far." 
  Carvajal said he believed that these rumors influence the 
rest of the committee members to act against the MIR to avoid 
speculation regarding the alleged negotiations. 
  The MIR deputy regretted the spreading of rumors on the 
performance of MIR senators in the impeachment process who, he 
asserted, "have conscientiously acknowledged the deputies' 
decision." 
  According to Carvajal, the MIR senators will vote according 
to their consciences "and nobody will be able to influence 
them." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santa Cruz, 11 Jun (PRESENCIA) -- Acting President 
Victor Hugo Cardenas said today that the country does not need 
any kind of political deal or secret "agreement," as he would be 
the first to report such cases. 
  Cardenas made this comment in reference to reports about a 
tacit agreement between the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary 
Left] and the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] by which 
no charges would be filed against national MIR leaders for their 
links with drug trafficking, in exchange for a harsh sentence 
for Justices Edgar Oblitas Fernandez and Ernesto Poppe Zubieta. 
  Cardenas rejected the validity of that report, saying that 
there are no real elements to sustain the media reports of a 
"dubious political scheme" between the MNR and the MIR regarding 
the two issues. Cardenas asserted that the government wants to 
do justice and not break it. 
  He said, however, that if a situation such as that reported 
by the media emerges, "I would be the first to report it and 
condemn it, as this type of agreement or deal can only hurt the 
country and the democratic process that was so hard for the 
country to recover." 
  President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada himself categorically 
denied the media report before leaving for Colombia and the 
United States, saying that "our struggle is against corruption. 
We don't negotiate these cases, and although we don't want to 
hurt anyone, our will is to enforce the law."

  [Excerpt] MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] Deputy Erwin Saucedo 
warned on 9 June that the MBL will leave the government if the 
political "agreement" is confirmed between the MIR [Movement of 
the Revolutionary Left] and the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary 
Movement] to exclude some MIR leaders from the final report by 
the Constitution Committee on the so-called "narcolinks" case 
[between the MIR and drug traffickers during Paz Zamora's 
government]. 
  The MBL deputy confirmed his position, stating that his 
party 
had decided to participate in the current government based on 
the MNR's conviction to fight corruption in all its forms and 
not to conceal such phenomenon that ruled the behavior of 
several leaders of the defunct Patriotic Accord. 
  "I think this is a subject that can break an accord (between 
the MBL and the MIR). If there are agreements and collusions not 
to fight corruption or if reports on the political settlements 
are confirmed, we will review the accord," Saucedo said. 
  The MBL deputy then reaffirmed his party's decision to begin 
an impeachment process against former President Jaime Paz Zamora 
if it is established that he had a criminal relationship with 
presumed drug trafficker Isaac "Oso" Chavarria. 
  However, the MBL deputy did not limit himself to that 
warning, but added that MIR congressmen, Constitution Committee 
members Edil Sandoval and Oliverio Iriarte, cannot throw 
overboard a serious work developed within that committee to find 
the truth about the "narcolinks." 
  Saucedo's concern stems from reports that meetings were held 
several days ago between MIR and MNR members in an effort to 
exclude former President Jaime Paz Zamora from the final 
Constitution Committee report in exchange for support of the 
government by the three MIR senators in the impeachment process 
against the Supreme Court justices. 
  It also was said that one of the meetings was reportedly 
held 
over the past weekend at the house of Senate President Juan 
Carlos Duran and that MIR bloc leader Carlos Borth was present 
at that meeting. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] La Paz HOY in Spanish on 12 June carries 
on page 18 a 1,500-word report datelined Santa Cruz by Jose 
Manuel Pando, who notes that "the assets seized from drug 
traffickers, instead of being used for social projects, go into 
the pockets of a few and disappear into thin air." 
  The report states that "five years after Law 1008 [the 
Repentance Law] was implemented, the state and society have 
hardly benefited from the confiscated goods of millionaires, 
which because of inadequate government policy get lost 
irretrievably." 
  Pando comments that "Law No. 1008 authorizes drug 
enforcement 
authorities to confiscate assets and investigate the origins of 
dubious fortunes, and in a few years has allowed the 
confiscation of mansions, farms, vehicles, aircraft, property, 
jewelry, and money worth more than $50 million, but 
unfortunately most of these goods have been stolen or misused." 
  The report then notes that Santa Cruz District Attorney 
Francisco Borestein commented not long ago that the assets 
seized from drug traffickers were misused, and that there were 
questions as to how the large sums of money seized from drug 
traffickers have been used. He also said that many assets had 
disappeared, such as was the case with several vehicles, because 
of poor administration. 
  The report then mentions Government Minister German Quiroga 
as having noted that the money seized from drug traffickers is 
placed into the hands of judicial authorities, while not long 
ago Attorney Ives Padilla said that the Office of the Attorney 
General is not in charge of administering and guarding 
confiscated assets because the Office of Confiscated Assets does 
that. 
  After describing several cases in which public servants 
misused the assets confiscated from drug traffickers, the report 
mentions that according to recent information there are 214 
confiscated vehicles and some 100 houses in Santa Cruz alone 
that run the risk of deteriorating or being looted by public 
servants.

  [Text] Antidrug "Operation Trebol" was conducted on 23 May 
in Santa Cruz: Three international traffickers organizations 
were dismantled, hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets were 
seized, and 23 presumed traffickers were caught. 
  According to the writ issued on 13 June by the lower court 
of 
controlled substances in La Paz, 15 of the 23 individuals 
arrested have been taken to the maximum security prison in 
Chonchocoro. During the operation 84,500 grams of cocaine were 
seized. 
  Judges Victor Lopez Alcala and Renan Moreno Aviles filed 
against Luis Alberto Arteaga Seleme and Iver Daza Suarez, for 
manufacturing, trafficking, and transporting cocaine. They are 
also accused of illegal association to commit crime and are 
being held at the Chonchocoro prison. 
  The judges also filed against Emilio Arce Vidal, Robin 
Rosales Agreda, Horario Arroyo Bonilla, and Ruddy Yassir 
Pedrazas Suarez. They are accused of manufacturing and 
trafficking cocaine, and of illegal association to commit crime. 
  The following, who are at large, are also accused of the 
same 
crime: Juan Carlos Araoz Antelo, Johnny Lara, Clider Matienzo 
Rodriguez, Victor Rosales Agreda, Johnny Rosales Agreda, 
Fernando Cadario Garrido, Carlos Alfonso Gutierrrez, and Freddy 
Eguez. 
  The antidrug judges also began criminal proceedings against 
Juan Rosales Agreda who is accused of murder, cocaine 
trafficking, and association to commit crime, while Luis 
Fernando Bascope Rivera is accused of cocaine trafficking and 
association to commit crime. 
  The following are accused of the same crime: Alcides Bascope 
Chavez, Wilfredo Rosales Agreda, Pedro Fernandez Barrientos, 
Elvio Cespedes Anez, Mario Antonio Artega Seleme, and Medardo 
Vargas Callau. 
  William Rosales Suarez is accused of participating in 
trafficking and manufacturing of cocaine, and association to 
commit crime. 
  The judges issued an arrest warrant against the eight people 
who are still at large. The Ministry of Government, through its 
specialized organizations, is ordered to catch them. 
  The writ of indictment was forwarded to the La Paz Superior 
Court for approval, according to current legal dispositions. 
  Antidrug judge Justino Ugarte expressed satisfaction over 
the 
second Court decision and said the Superior Court must ratify 
the measures. 
  "The Superior Criminal Court must approve the indictment 
issued by the antidrug judges who filed the accusation based on 
evidence of involvement," the criminal prosecutor said. 
  Beside dismantling three trafficking organizations, 
"Operation Trebol" allowed the seizure of assets estimated at 
several hundred thousand of dollars. 
  The following properties were seized in Santa Cruz: 
properties on Mutualista Avenue and Paragua Street, at 605 
Cotoca Canal, at Km 12 of the old highway to Cochabamba, on the 
corner of the third beltway and Pedro Rivera Mendez Street, at 
the "Suto" condominium, on San Aurelio Avenue, and on Virgen de 
Cotoca Avenue. 
  According to the seizure records, 38 assorted vehicles were 
seized at two urban properties--Aurelio and Cotoca. 
  The police seized 22 vehicles at "Cotoca Automobile Sales," 
among them trucks, tractors, automobiles, vans, jeeps, and 
pickups. Likewise, 16 vehicles were seized at "San Aurelio 
Automobile Sales." Nine other automobiles were seized in 
different places.

  [Text] La Paz -- Minister of Government German Quiroga 
Gomez has stated that due to current coca prices (180 Bolivian 
pesos per load), it is impossible to successfully implement an 
alternative development program in the Chapare region. Quiroga 
said that in view of this, it is indispensable to increase drug 
enforcement in this region. Ten years of statistics show that 
by increasing interdiction, market values decrease and more 
peasants decide to resort to alternative products. 
  Quiroga said that currently there are virtually no valid 
arguments to convince coca growers to replace their crops, 
because it is not economically profitable. 
  Quiroga delivered a speech during the opening ceremony of 
the 
Seminar on Alternative Development sponsored by the U.S. 
Embassy's USIS in conjunction with the Social Defense 
Undersecretariat and the La Paz Journalists Association. The 
seminar was held for around 20 journalists from several 
departments who are travelling today to Chapare to observe the 
development of banana, citrus fruit, and pineapple plantations 
and the like. 
  Quiroga added that peasants would be willing to replace 
their 
excess coca crops when they were convinced it was more 
profitable to produce other crops. He said that for farmers it 
is a question of opportunity and necessity, and that it is 
essential to take this into account to achieve proper levels of 
alternative development. Quiroga stated: "It is meaningless to 
invest in infrastructure and equipment in the Chapare region if 
it is not profitable for coca growers to switch crops." 
  Quiroga said: "With current prices, we will never be able to 
replace coca farming if we exclusively rely on the good will of 
coca growers, and Bolivia will continue to be the second largest 
drug producer." 
  Quiroga explained that the current policy of control of 
dangerous substances groups under one single unit the three 
aspects of drug enforcement (interdiction, alternative 
development, and drug prevention). He said that from this point 
of view the Ministry of Government will implement alternative 
development and peasant education programs wherever there are 
interdiction and drug enforcement programs. 
  Quiroga said it is regrettable that in Bolivia the only 
newsworthy articles are those related to trafficking activities 
in what he described as the "bad Chapare" region, and that this 
represents only 20 percent of the population. He said that the 
remaining 80 percent has either always been devoted to legal 
activities or is voluntarily replacing its excess coca crops. 
  He added that five years ago the Chapare region only 
produced 
coca that was sold in the market. Quiroga said that nowadays 
coca is neither transported nor marketed. He said that instead 
cocaine paste is being produced on nearby plantations, because 
peasants have available the technical facilities to macerate 
coca. Sixty percent of the coca growers in the Cochabamba 
tropical region are involved in drug trafficking. Quiroga 
warned that "we have a time bomb on our hands." 
  Moreover, Social Defense Under Secretary Mario Soliz said 
that through an agreement approved by the COB [Bolivian Labor 
Federation] on 23 March, coca growers have agreed to eradicate 
5,000 hectares of coca by the end of the year, and that they are 
therefore obliged to comply with this. Soliz said that the 
government is empowered to exercise interdiction mechanisms if 
this goal is not achieved. He added, however, that the current 
policy favors dialogue with coca producers, as there is no 
intention of turning the alternative development program into a 
violent issue, and even less of turning against the peasants.

  [Text] Government Minister German Quiroga has said that the 
leaders among the coca growers are unwilling to eradicate their 
surplus coca plantations, and that they are not fulfilling their 
commitment with the executive power. 
  While the government is willing to invest about $21 million 
in alternative development as the coca surplus is being 
eradicated, Quiroga revealed that the coca leaders are visiting 
the settlements of Carrasco Province in the Cochabamba 
Department to convince the growers not to eradicate coca. 
  Quiroga announced that to correct this situation, the 
government will do "something" to lower the price of coca. 
  He said: "If we don't get the price of coca produced for 
drug trafficking to drop, the policy of voluntary eradication 
will fail." 
  According to the minister, the only reason coca is well paid 
by drug traffickers is because there is no adequate control 
system for marketing coca. 
  This has been proven by the government, which is sure that 
when the main coca market in Sacaba operates without control the 
price of coca increases some 20 to 25 percent. 
  "As soon as the Sacaba market is put under control, the 
price 
tends to drop," said Quiroga, who indicated that coca prices 
will drop if the five coca markets are kept under control.

  [Text] La Paz, 6 Jun (JATHA) -- The coca growers who said 
the government spent $100 million on alternative development in 
the last 10 years came out short in their estimate when the 
government disclosed that it spent $207 million on that project 
in the last 10 years. 
  This information was provided by Social Defense Secretary 
Mario Soliz who invited the media to visit the Chapare "to see 
what had been done with that money, projects such as 
electrification, roads, health clinics, schools, etc." 
  In view of the doubt emerging about the multimillion dollar 
investment and the "great projects" carried out in the last 10 
years, Soliz said: "As in any operation some mistakes were made, 
wrong criteria were used but we cannot deny the existence of 
alternative development because of that." The questions were 
asked by the coca growers who recently said through their 
leaders that coca replacement or agricultural conversion should 
have been done on the 26,000 hectares that were voluntarily 
eradicated in the tropical region of Cochabamba. 
  But according to the technical reports of the institutions 
in 
charge of carrying out alternative development such as PDAR 
[Alternative Development Program], the IBTA [Bolivian Institute 
of Nuclear Science and Technology] of Chapare, and the United 
Nations, coca replacement was only done on 2,000 hectares. 
  Leader Felipe Caceres said: "This means that 24,000 hectares 
are full of weeds while the peasants who eradicated coca from 
them are bankrupt, without work, and sometimes forced to get 
involved in illegal activities." 
  Were those $207 million really invested in the Chapare, 
asked 
Secretary Soliz again today? His response was: "Yes, the records 
and the evaluation made by the organizations involved in the 
program show they were." 
  But the coca growers said the majority of the organizations 
involved in alternative development spent more money on paying 
their employees' salaries and travelling expenses than on the 
projects themselves. 
  Soliz replied that paying salaries is part of the work on 
alternative development. 
  Soliz said that because there are different criteria, 
peasant 
leaders have been invited to participate in or become members of 
the executive board of the Fonadal [National Fund for 
Alternative Development]. 
  He added: "This is how they will be able to check the 
projects, and express their opinions which is something that was 
not done in the past. But from now on they will be the main 
participants in this process." 
  Government Minister German Quiroga said that in the last 10 
years more investments have been made in alternative development 
than in any other Latin American country and this is "a 
demonstration that alternative development was made and will 
continue to be made." 
  Quiroga added that this at least "shows that the government 
struggle is not against coca growers but against those who use 
coca to make other products."

<F P=106> [Article by Delfin Arias Vargas] </F>
  [Text] According to several government officials, 
alternative development, understood as a process of 
socioeconomic transformations, is the main instrument intended 
to reverse the economy that depends on coca in the Chapare 
region. 
  According to official data provided by the Government 
Ministry and other state and private institutions that work in 
programs seeking to replace coca crops with other products, 
those remarks are based on the gradual increase in 
agroindustrial activities in that controversial area. 
  Although this solution is apparently feasible, there are 
several objections such as the inconceivable influence of drug 
traffickers to maintain justifiable prices for the surplus coca 
leaves, the precarious economic situation of most peasants in 
the Chapare region, and the lack of assured markets for the 
products they intend to replace, without mentioning the 
industrialization of coca for a reduced national market that 
makes the project already approved by the executive branch 
unfeasible. 
  Notwithstanding this situation, government officials claim 
that the change is possible. They argue that in the past few 
years the investment of more than $200 million in the region has 
helped conduct a gradual transformation that will help improve 
the production capacity and the growth of alternative crops. 
  Gaston Martinic, chairman of the National Fund for 
Alternative Development (Fonadal), stated: "If we manage to 
make the peasants understand this, namely the peasant producers 
of coca, we will be paving the way toward the fulfillment of the 
anti-drug fight's objectives, in addition to achieving a process 
for development and voluntary replacement of coca crops." 
  In a seminar sponsored by the La Paz Reporters Association, 
Martinic explained that preliminary studies have determined that 
the share of the coca-cocaine economy in the country's GDP in 
1987 was 26 percent. He added that coca production yielded $238 
million, mainly benefiting drug traffickers. 
  Since then, drug enforcement action has allowed substantial 
achievements, including the eradication of almost 25,000 
hectares of coca crops considered illegal by Law No. 1008. 
However, the action has caused the loss in value added tax 
revenue of $472.3 million for the country, which uncovered the 
national economy's dependency on the coca-cocaine circuit, 
Martinic added. 
  Official reports on projects carried out through March in 
Chapare allow us to cite the following results that, considering 
the 250,000 inhabitants living in that region, cannot be called 
successful, according to peasant leaders, who even question the 
figures' accuracy. 
  With the support of U.S. AID and the UNDCP [United Nations 
Drug Control Program] of the United Nations, 818 km of roads 
were restored, 618 km were made usable, and 19 bridges were 
built in the region. 
  They said that in the past few years U.S. AID has subsidized 
the construction of 38 schools, the provision of drinkable water 
to 59 towns, the revamping of 15 community centers, and a vast 
social assistance program. 
  Concerning electric services, 394 km of primary lines, 110 
km 
of secondary lines, and 24 transformers were installed, and 
1,165 street lights also were installed. 
  The same reports add that the increase in alternative crops, 
which despite the gradual increase, only matches the surplus 
coca crops estimated at 35,500 hectares. 
  Bananas: A total of 7,075 hectares were planted in 1986, but 
in 1993 banana plantations reached 10,875 hectares. Pineapple: 
In 1986 a total of 395 hectares of pineapple were harvested, 
but 2,618 hectares were planted in 1993. Black pepper: The 
first crops reached 32 hectares in 1993. Passion fruit: A total 
of 63 hectares of this fruit were planted in 1993. Subsistence 
crops: In 1986 a total of 8,000 hectares were planted, while in 
1993 planting reached 11,558 hectares. Heart of palms: A total 
of 241 hectares were planted in 1993 alone.

  [Text] La Paz, 12 Jun (ANF) -- Minister of Government 
German Quiroga has stated that the administration has $21 
million to replace with other crops the coca plantations on 
35,200 hectares in the subtropical region of Cochabamba 
Department. 
  He explained that this investment is included in this year's 
budget, and will be implemented provided the peasant leaders 
allow it and do not oppose the voluntary eradication of coca. 
  Quiroga admitted that peasant union leaders are one of the 
main obstacles for the Alternative Development Program, as they 
are urging union members to oppose voluntary eradication in 
order to obtain more benefits. 
  Government sources have explained that through alternative 
development the Chapare--Bolivia's top coca-producing region, 
and the world's second largest--will benefit from agricultural 
development that will eventually replace the drug-driven 
underground economy. 
  According to the sources, the products that will replace 
coca 
will be: bananas, pineapple, heart of palm, fodder, crafts, and 
other profitable items. 
  According to information obtained from the "First Itinerant 
Show: Bolivia Free from Drugs," at the end of November 1993 the 
country had 47,200 hectares of coca plantations, that is, 35,200 
hectares in excess of the 11,725 hectares needed to supply 
traditional uses. 
  At that time the nation's overall production of coca leaves 
from these 47,200 hectares was 82,800 tons, of which 71,075 tons 
went to drug traffickers. 
  These figures will decline once the voluntary eradication 
program is underway. The U.S. Government has offered to 
contribute $20 million to the program if Bolivia complies with 
the eradication target of 5,000 hectares.

  [Text] Tarija -- The 10th Workers Congress that probably 
will end in the next few hours has defended coca crops and 
demanded the industrialization of this controversial leaf that, 
according to peasants, is constantly threatened by foreign 
interests. 
  Thus, the Workers Congress passed a resolution condemning 
the 
"merciless intervention of North American troops in the coca 
zones, openly ignoring our national sovereignty." 
  For Bolivia, coca is not cocaine; it is a natural product 
and 
resource that is part of the Bolivian national culture and must 
be defended by endorsing its industrialization and 
decriminalization. 
  According to the workers, coca must be defended as part of 
the cultural patrimony of the region's countries. The labor 
representatives expressed their wish to internationally 
decriminalize this Peruvian and Bolivian leaf. 
  Activities by nongovernment organizations (NGO's) in the 
coca- producing areas were harshly criticized by the labor 
representatives, who demanded their expulsion because these 
NGO's want to divide the strong coca farmers' movement. 
  The resolution approved by the Workers Congress calls for 
the 
total implementation of alternative development programs because 
they are considered a serious method to replace the coca economy. 
  The Chapare, a controversial region as a result of the 
presence of coca and drug trafficking, was declared a national 
emergency zone to protect it from a possible militarization of 
the area on the pretext of replacing the coca economy. 
  The workers also asked that peasant markets depend directly 
on peasant organizations. Peasant representatives also expressed 
their concern at the lack of roads.

<F P=106> [Article by Sao Paulo "special correspondent" Luis Ocampo </F>
Alonso] 
  [Text] The seizure of the largest shipment of cocaine ever 
confiscated in Latin America (7.5 metric tons) at Alborada 
ranch, located in Tocantins, western Brazil, at the beginning of 
June and the arrest of 14 drug traffickers linked to the Cali 
cartel enabled the U.S. DEA and Brazilian Federal Police to 
discover one of the leading money laundering networks operating 
in the Western Hemisphere. 
  Address books and computer diskettes the aforementioned drug 
traffickers had in their possession were instrumental in 
establishing that the drug money route started in the United 
States (New York) and Colombia and joined up in Ciudad del Este 
in bank accounts at a branch of The Bank of the Netherlands. 
The holder of these accounts is Nasrat Mohamad Jamil Rassoul, a 
well-known "border manager" of Lebanese extraction who owns real 
estate and businesses in Ciudad del Este--the capital of Alto 
Parana Department--and Foz do Iguacu. From Ciudad del Este, 
the dollars were transferred through several operations to 
another account that Rassoul himself had at the Bamerindus Bank 
in Foz do Iguacu. From there the money was once again 
transferred to the Bank of Brazil agencies located in different 
Brazilian cities to several account holders, many of whom were 
fictitious. 
  Brazilian and U.S. investigators asserted that all the 
financial resources used by the gang busted in Tocantins to 
purchase the aforementioned ranch, several aircraft, motor 
boats, cars, and even to set up at least three companies that 
would act as a front for their activities came to Brazil via 
Ciudad del Este. This means that movements in Rassoul's 
accounts amounted to more than $1 million in approximately 10 
months. Rassoul was seconded in his dealings by fellow 
countryman David Haddad (both are currently held in custody in 
Brasilia). The amount of money in those movements has led the 
DEA to suspect that some Paraguayan regional or national 
"high-ranking authority" might have facilitated the 
establishment and operations of the Cali cartel in Ciudad del 
Este. 
  Another detail that has caught the attention of DEA and 
Brazilian drug enforcement agents is the involvement of Samia 
Haddock Lobo, a Brazilian businesswoman (at present a fugitive 
from justice) in the dismantled drug gang. Haddock Lobo is a 
member of a very respectable Rio de Janeiro family that 
allegedly has properties and investments in Paraguay. Antonio 
Mota Graca, the entrepreneur's husband, escaped from a Sao Paulo 
prison approximately two years ago. He was in prison on drug 
trafficking charges. Brazilian Federal Police sources think Mota 
Graca is hiding somewhere in Paraguay. 
  If all this was not enough, Brazilian journalists following 
the Tocantins case told NOTICIAS that one of the passports used 
by arrested Colombian citizen Vicente Rivera Ramos, son of one 
of the Medellin cartel's big shots, was stamped several times by 
our country's immigration authorities, indicating that his trips 
between Colombia, Brazil, and Paraguay were frequent. It is not 
too credible to maintain that the international drug trafficking 
"big shot" visited our country frequently simply because he was 
attracted by the beauty of our women or the sweetness of our 
polkas and guaranias [national folk music]. 
  Central Bank, Federal Revenue Office (the central tax 
collection organization), and Federal Police authorities in the 
neighboring country are concerned with the volume of drug 
trafficking operations in Brazil, and in the next few days will 
start a large joint operation to exchange information, trying to 
detect any money laundering scheme used in the country. No one 
doubts that the U.S. DEA will follow the Brazilian 
anti-narcotics operation very closely and that one of the 
study's main targets will be precisely the Ciudad del Este-Foz 
do Iguacu axis.

  [Text] How was the Tocantins ranch, where Latin America's 
largest cocaine shipment was discovered a few weeks ago, 
purchased? This question prompted the Brazilian Federal Police 
to conduct further investigations. Following these 
investigations, the possibility arose that Ciudad del Este was 
the Cali Cartel mafiosi's base of operations for laundering 
money. 
  An AP report datelined Rio de Janeiro notes that the 
unprecedented seizure of 7.5 metric tons of cocaine in early 
June allowed the discovery of a money laundering network of the 
Cali Cartel, a Colombian drug trafficking ring. 
  Police chief Antonio Borges reported that the criminal 
organization used bank accounts in New York, Paraguay, and 
Brazil to transfer money and invest in the Brazilian drug 
trafficking market for storing and exporting cocaine. 
<H5>  The Lebanese </H5>
  After the details of the seizure operation became available, 
Nasrat Mohamed Jamil, a Lebanese-Brazilian citizen who had 
established covert businesses in Ciudad del Este, became the 
main target in unraveling the mafia's tentacles. He had been 
living in Foz do Iguacu (where he was detained on the eve of the 
operation carried out in the aforementioned Brazilian state) 
after his separation two years ago from Vera Lucia Minikoski, 
who had filed a petition with the Parana State courts to divide 
their common property, demanding about $20 million. 
  According to Borges, Jamil was the drug trafficking ring's 
treasurer for the Cali Cartel's complicated money transfers in 
Brazil, where one of its lords, Vicente Wilson Rivera Ramos, had 
established himself. Rivera Ramos, along with another 11 people, 
was arrested for allegedly trafficking in cocaine to the United 
States. 
<H5>  Colombia-United States-Paraguay </H5>
  The police chief added that the drug money was remitted from 
Colombia to two banks in New York, and from New York to the Cali 
Cartel's base of financial operations in Ciudad del Este. The 
funds were withdrawn in cash and deposited in a bank in Foz do 
Iguacu, from where they were transferred to various accounts in 
various Brazilian cities under false names.

  [Text] Cayman, along with 23 other countries, 
has been charged to have a draft master plan for drug control 
ready by 1 July, according to a press release issued by GIS. 
  The challenge came at the end of a five-day regional drug 
control workshop attended by Miss Andrea Bryan, Acting Permanent 
Secretary in the Ministry of Health, Drug Abuse Prevention and 
Rehabilitation. 
  The workshop, held in Barbados on 21-25 March, was entitled 
"Master Plan Development and Co-ordination Mechanisms." It was 
held under the auspices of the United Nations International Drug 
Control Programme (UNDCP). Miss Bryan attended it in preparation 
for development of Cayman's plan on drug abuse prevention and 
control. 
  After the workshop, Miss Bryan said that the main consensus 
of the 24 participating countries was that production, 
trafficking, use and abuse of legal and illegal drugs is a 
growing social problem worldwide. 
  The Caribbean with its scores of islands and cays continued 
to be vulnerable to intrusions of illegal drug trafficking. 
"Although the Caribbean itself produces relatively little 
illicit drugs, we are in the path of suppliers and consumers," 
she said. 
  Miss Bryan said that the Ministry was optimistic about the 
impact of the plan being developed. Although drug abuse might be 
difficult--or even impossible--to eradicate, education and 
rehabilitation could serve as powerful forces to turn round the 
situation in Cayman. 
  One of the benefits of the workshop, Miss Bryan said, was 
the 
commitment by participants to exchange information and share 
resources to help each other develop national plans. 
  Inter-sectoral collaboration within each country was deemed 
critical. Education, Customs, Police, Immigration and other 
sectors, as well as non-governmental organisations, needed to 
work together. "Each hand must know what the other is doing," 
she emphasised. 
  Part of the workshop included role playing by 
representatives 
to demonstrate development of a master plan for an imaginary 
state, "This was a very useful exercise and gave us an idea of 
what our own country's master plan should cover," Miss Bryan 
said. 
  Donor agencies gave presentations on sources of funds for 
drug abuse prevention programmes and presentations on projects 
being undertaken in the region.

<F P=106> [From the "CMI" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Samper met with Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff and President Gaviria today. 
Meanwhile, Conservative candidate Andres Pastrana has called a 
news conference for tomorrow. 
  The contacts to finance the political campaigns were made 
between 7 and 11 June, a few days before the runoff elections. 
In the recordings, journalist Alberto Giraldo talks with Miguel 
Rodriguez Orejuela [Cali Cartel leader] and tells him about the 
need for funds to cover expenses at the end of the campaigns. 
They mention five billion pesos. Here are excerpts of three of 
the six recordings. The others cannot be disclosed for legal 
reasons. [begin recording] 
  Giraldo: The man urgently needs money. 
  Rodriguez: Who is the man? Eduardo? 
  Giraldo: Yes, he asked me to act as emissary. 
  Rodriguez: Fine. 
  Giraldo: Yes, yes. 
  Rodriguez: Is he the same one I know? 
  Giraldo: Yes, yes, yes. 
  Rodriguez: There are a few little problems here. 
  Giraldo: Oh? 
  Rodriguez: Because they want everything, 
everything, everything, everything, everything, everything. 
There are five points there that are basic commands, right? 
  Giraldo: Yes. 
  Rodriguez: Another thing... 
  Giraldo, interrupting: How do you see things in 
the [word indistinct]? 
  Rodriguez: I am in your hands. It sounds funny, 
doesn't it? 
  Giraldo: Then why is Medina saying that Santo 
Domingo or whatever they want to give him? 
  Rodriguez: No [words indistinct] 
  Giraldo: That is what he told us that day. I 
heard him, but his saint wants the same length and width. They 
have a limit and [words indistinct] the truth is they need five 
billion. They already have two billion; they need three billion 
more. 
  Rodriguez: Oh. 
  Giraldo: They are there. 
  Rodriguez: Yes? 
  Giraldo: Yes [words indistinct]. [end recording] 
  After confirming that they were there, Giraldo tells 
Rodriguez Orejuela in another conversation that he is upset 
about articles in LA PRENSA that mentioned him as spokesman of 
the Cali Cartel. Rodriguez Orejuela then tells him not to worry 
as the other campaign had reportedly received $2.5 million from 
the so-called Northern Valle Cartel. 
  The recordings also mention money presumably received by 
General Miguel Maza Marquez. 
  [Begin recording] 
  Giraldo: I talked to Maza. 
  Rodriguez: Yes? 
  Giraldo: He [words indistinct] after what I told 
him, but I hope he gives it to me in cash. 
  Rodriguez: [Words indistinct] 
  Giraldo: I hope he gives it to me in cash, to 
deliver it tomorrow. 
  Rodriguez: [Words indistinct] 
  Giraldo: Good. Okay. [end recording] 
  The two people speaking mentioned a Pastrana supporter in 
the 
coffee producing areas. Before starting the second 
conversation, one of them warns the other of the risk that their 
call could be intercepted, to which the other replies: Don't 
worry, brother, these phones are safe.

<F P=106> [News conference by Colombian President-elect Ernesto Samper </F>
Pizano at Narino Palace in Santa Fe de Bogota on 21 
June--recorded] 
  [Text] Samper: The truth is that if the campaign 
is investigated it will be because we have requested it. We 
were officially notified of the cassette during the latter part 
of last week when it was officially given to us at the [words 
indistinct]. At the time, we were also told that it had been 
given to the president of the republic. This cassette contains 
very serious accusations against both campaigns; Dr. Andres 
Pastrana's campaign as well as ours. I am adamant about having 
this matter cleared up thoroughly so that we may know exactly 
which representatives of Dr. Pastrana's campaign and my 
campaign, were apparently involved in using drug trafficking 
money during the past presidential elections. 
  I will accept the results of the investigations that must be 
made by the Prosecutor General, and if anyone who worked for my 
campaign, is proven to have been involved--as the cassette 
indicates--in this incident, they will be withdrawn from my 
government and they will not participate in my administration, 
regardless of the legal penalties that may be imposed on them. 
  Thus, I believe, this case has to be totally clarified. I, 
as President, assure Colombians that this procedure will allow 
us to know the truth regarding the events described in the 
cassette, which was revealed yesterday and which involves my and 
Dr. Pastrana's campaign. 
  Reporter: It had been said initially [words 
indistinct] because there was information that drug trafficking 
money was being used in politics. Does this have anything to do 
with this latest incident? 
  Samper: Maribel, the code of ethics was really 
implemented rigorously throughout. Today, I obtained the 
information I had requested on the campaign and it allows me to 
reiterate, as I said yesterday, that money of doubtful origin 
has not been used in my campaign. I want to invite any 
Colombian or media source, who cares to do so, to conduct a 
thorough examination of my campaign's accounting books. I made 
this commitment and I maintained it to the end. Likewise, the 
ethical prosecutor studied the origin of all the resources used 
in my campaign. That is why I am absolutely at ease and I want 
to express my total tranquility to Colombians. No drug 
trafficking resources were used in my campaign and the 
Prosecutor General will also be able to assess this in the books 
we presented to him today for his scrutiny. 
  Reporter: Good evening, Dr. Samper. You said the 
tape was officially delivered to you. Were you informed at that 
time who the people in this recording were? 
  Samper: No. We simply received the tape. We were 
told it contained accusations against both campaigns and that 
the government wanted us to know about it. After viewing the 
tape, we issued a first declaration rejecting the statements 
made in the tape. Second, I met with the prosecutor general 
today for over three hours and, as president-elect, officially 
requested this investigation. It is in the best interests of the 
former Samper and Pastrana campaigns and of democracy that this 
issue be clarified. I repeat: I will abide by the results of 
the prosecutor general's investigation. 
  If that investigation reveals that people from my campaign 
are involved in the events described on the tape, I am willing 
to remove them from the campaign team. They will not join the 
government and will be subject to the appropriate penalties. 
  Reporter: Dr. Samper, considering that microphones 
were found at your home and campaign headquarters, do you think 
this could be a campaign against you? What do you think is the 
origin of this [word indistinct]? 
  Samper: I don't know. Based on what has been said 
by the people who conducted the preliminary investigation, I 
think the tape is authentic. I hope it is not part of a plot 
against me, because that would have the effect not of 
discrediting Ernesto Samper but of undermining democracy. I 
want to reiterate to all Colombians that we have paid a high 
price in blood over the last 10 years to move our country ahead 
and defeat narcoterrorism. I was personally a victim of 
narcoterrorism. That gives me the moral authority to tell 
Colombians that we will continue to work at home and abroad to 
let the world know we are not the perpetrator but the main 
victim of drug trafficking. 
  Reporter: Good evening, Dr. Samper. There is a 
recording linking your campaign to drug money. How can you 
justify this incident? What is your opinion? How will this 
affect national and international public opinion, considering 
that you were just elected president on Sunday? 
  Samper: As I have said, this tape implicates the 
two campaign groups of the recent presidential campaign. I 
think the mere act of sowing doubt adversely affects the 
country. It affects the country's image abroad. I am therefore 
committed to clarifying this matter, not only as Ernesto Samper, 
former presidential candidate--I assume this commitment because 
I must defend the integrity of my campaign, as I have reiterated 
over the past year--but also as president of Colombia so this 
issue will not affect Colombia's long struggle against drug 
trafficking. This evening I reaffirm my commitment to continue 
fighting drug trafficking in all its forms. I also wish to 
reaffirm this commitment so Colombia's international image will 
not be affected. 
  I emphatically reject the charges. It is disturbing to think 
that these incidents could become a regular thing, as is thought 
by people in some parts of the world where they believe all 
Colombians are drug traffickers. I reject this assertion and 
the insinuations in the tape, in which two people are holding a 
dialogue apart from any campaign. This dialogue ultimately 
affects the two main candidates in the recent election.

  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Samper has flatly denied his 
campaign received any money of doubtful origin and placed his 
accounting books at the disposal of the Prosecutor General's 
Office. 
  [Begin recording of unidentified reporter reading communique 
from Samper campaign] 
  1. The president-elect talked today with the prosecutor 
general to request a swift and efficient investigation of the 
facts. He placed the campaign books at the disposal of that 
office to be thoroughly reviewed. 
  2. From the very start of the campaign, we warned of the 
danger of the infiltration of drug trafficking money into 
politics, and that is why an ethics code was issued that devotes 
a special chapter to control over the origin of resources for 
the campaign, and an ethics prosecutor of the highest moral 
qualities was named to enforce the code and prevent this 
infiltration. No other campaign, therefore, had greater control 
or was stricter in receiving resources than ours. As a result 
of this strict control, we can categorically affirm today that 
our campaign treasury received no money of doubtful origin. 
  3. Any Colombian citizen or news media wishing to review the 
campaign books may do so from this moment and corroborate, as 
the overseer of the national Treasury did, the origin of 
donations received this past year. 
  4. The president-elect has once again reiterated his 
unyielding commitment to fight drug trafficking, combating it 
decisively in the military field but without repealing the 
policy of surrendering to justice promoted by the current 
government. By the same token, he will maintain all 
international commitments to cooperate in fighting this scourge. 
Not one millimeter will be yielded to this crime, and the 
international community will be asked to take clearer 
responsibility to persecute money laundering and consumption in 
developed nations. 
  5. The president-elect appeals for peace so situations such 
as this one are not used lightly as political weapons that harm 
Colombia's image abroad. [end recording]

  [Text] The Ministry of Defense tonight issued a communique 
detailing the information the government received on the 
recordings. At approximately 1730 on Thursday, 16 June, Dr. 
Andres Pastrana and Dr. Luis Alberto Moreno paid a visit to the 
president and minister of defense and presented them with a tape 
containing three telephone conversations. The first two 
conversations were allegedly between journalist Alberto Giraldo 
and Mr. Miguel Orejuela and the third conversation was between 
Giraldo and Mr. Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela. 
  Dr. Pastrana said he received the tape in the city of Cali 
the day before from people who did not identify themselves. 
Early on 17 June, the minister of defense, at the request of 
the president of the Republic, ordered the military forces 
general command and the police general directorate to confirm 
the veracity of voices and forward, as soon as possible, the 
tape and results of voice confirmation to the Prosecutor 
General's Office. The same order was given to the DAS 
[Administrative Department of Security] director. 
  After informing the prosecutor general, that same 17 June 
Dr. 
Ernesto Samper Pizano was informed about this situation and a 
copy of the tape was forwarded to him. At about 1630 on 17 
June, at the request of the defense minister, three Armed Forces 
commanders delivered the recording personally to the prosecutor 
general. The results of the confirmation of voices were 
forwarded first on Friday and then on Saturday. 
  Taking into consideration that this investigation falls 
under 
the Prosecutor General's Office, the government immediately 
forwarded the tapes and the voice confirmation to that agency. 
Additionally and as is routine, the government and Armed Forces 
are ready to assist the Prosecutor General's Office in all 
support needed in this case.

  [Text] An article published by Miami's EL NUEVO HERALD has 
made accusations in the disturbing case of the narco-cassette 
tapes, according to which drug trafficking groups made donations 
to the campaign of President-elect Ernesto Samper. With the 
case still under investigation, EL NUEVO HERALD added things 
that have not been alleged here in Colombia. 
  In turn, President-elect Ernesto Samper sent the following 
letter to the editors of EL NUEVO HERALD--Messrs. (David 
Lorenz), (Bob Scribford), and (Sandra Keys)--and Roberto Suarez, 
a reporter for THE MIAMI HERALD and EL NUEVO HERALD: 
  Dear Gentlemen: With suprise and indignation I read today 
the report that appeared in EL NUEVO HERALD, according to which 
the U.S. Government has confirmed I received money from the Cali 
Cartel for my electoral campaign. In addition, the report 
presents a totally false story that contains slanderous remarks 
I am not willing to let go unchallenged, not only for the sake 
of my own dignity but for that of all of Colombia. 
  I have never received money from any criminal organization 
to 
fund my political activities, as demonstrated by my campaign 
ledgers. These ledgers show that we carefully monitored the 
origin of campaign funds. 
  As president-elect of all citizens of Colombia, I renounce 
the article published today, and I demand that you correct the 
false information in this report, which damages my honor and the 
honor of my country. 
  [Signed] Yours Truly, Ernesto Samper Pizano

    [Editorial Report] Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol 
Network in Spanish at 1519 GMT on 22 June broadcasts live in 
progress, from an undisclosed location, a 62-minute news 
conference by Andres Pastrana, former Colombian presidential 
candidate of the New Democratic Force party, with unidentified 
domestic and foreign reporters. 
  At 1519 GMT, Pastrana begins by saying "the president-elect 
is lying when he tried to implicate the campaign of Andres 
Pastrana and Luis Fernando Ramirez in drug trafficking 
activities." He then adds: "That is why I convened this news 
conference; to set the record straight." 
  At 1521 GMT, Pastrana comments on audio cassette recordings 
of individuals allegedly linking his and President-elect 
Samper's presidential campaigns with drug money. He then reads 
a statement, which begins by noting that "on 15 June at the 
Intercontinental Hotel in Cali, when leaving a banquet offered 
by Valle del Cauca political leaders, a person delivered to me a 
tape saying it was important." Pastrana then gives a chronology 
of the events leading up to the disclosure of the cassette 
recordings. Pastrana later reads a letter he sent to Samper 
asking him to rebut charges drug money was being used for his 
electoral campaign if there was nothing to hide, "a thing he did 
not do." 
  At 1527 GMT, Pastrana explains he refused to use this 
recording for electoral purposes. He states: "Knowing about 
this tape before the elections, the cassette was not used for 
electoral purposes." At 1530 GMT, Pastrana begins playing a 
portion of the tape recording, with poor reception, of two 
unidentified individuals suggesting that Pastrana's and Samper's 
campaigns received drug money. At 1531 GMT, Pastrana stops 
playing the recording to note that his campaign treasurer had 
turned down an offer, conveyed by journalist Alberto Giraldo, 
from "some people in Cali who wished to donate money for the 
campaign of Andres Pastrana." Pastrana then continues playing 
the recording of two unidentified men discussing possible 
campaign contributions. 
  At 1547 GMT, after playing the recording, Pastrana says: "At 
no time does the recording refer to donations to my campaign." 
He then says he received a call from the prosecutor general 
asking him to confirm the delivery of the tape to President 
Gaviria, and he says he will confirm this delivery. Pastrana 
states that "from the tapes it cannot be inferred that my 
campaign requested or received offers of drug money." At 1600 
GMT, Pastrana states: "If it is proven that the Colombian 
president-elect's campaign received funds from drug traffickers, 
he must relinquish the mandate he received from the people; 
otherwise his credentials will be distorted." 
  At 1552 GMT, when asked if he is asking Dr. Samper to 
resign, 
Pastrana asserts: "If it is confirmed that drug money was used 
for his campaign, he should be ready to resign the presidency as 
I would be if I won the election and if my campaign had received 
drug money." When asked how can he assure he did not receive 
Cartel money, Pastrana says: "Do you think I would go to the 
president of the republic to tell him, here is a tape that 
compromises me, please investigate me." At 1555 GMT, he 
continues: "Three days before the elections I made a clear 
proposal. After learning about the tape I said I was willing to 
resign if it were proven that there was drug money in my 
campaign." 
  At 1605 GMT, Pastrana explains he is not hesitant to 
surrender the accounting books of his campaign, adding: "Those 
books are always open. In my case, we have not only turned the 
books over to the supervisory commission but also to the 
National Electoral Council, which closes out electoral campaign 
books." When asked if he would be willing to cooperate with the 
Samper administration after it is confirmed Samper did not 
receive drug money, Pastrana says: "I personally do not hope to 
participate in the Samper administration." 
  At 1613 GMT, Pastrana asserts: "No one in the world can say 
my campaign was funded by drug money." When asked about General 
Maza's involvement in this episode, Pastrana responds: "This is 
worrisome; there are statements in the recording that are very 
worrisome. It is up to the public to assess these statements." 
  Responding to an indistinct question at 1615 GMT, Pastrana 
states: "More than thinking about a deterioration of relations 
with the United States, the country demands that this matter be 
clarified." When questioned if he is ready to lead a movement 
to force the resignation of a corrupt president similar to those 
in Brazil and Venezuela, Pastrana says: "I would rather wait 
for the results of the investigation." 
  Pastrana concludes his news conference at 1622 GMT by 
stating 
that he has received death threats from the drug cartels and by 
answering questions on the upcoming soccer match between 
Colombia and the United States.

<F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Ernesto Samper and Andres </F>
Pastrana, the defeated New Democratic Force presidential 
candidate, at unspecified locations by studio announcers and 
reporters; from the "QAP" newscast--live] 
  [Excerpts] 
  Ines Maria Zavarain: Good evening. Ernesto Samper 
Pizano is the new Colombian president-elect. He won over his 
contender Andres Pastrana by a margin of more than 132,000 
votes. He is our special guest this evening. Good evening, Dr. 
Samper. 
  Samper: Good evening, how are you doing? 
  Zavarain: Very well, thank you. Tell us, when you 
awoke this morning, what was the first thing that came to your 
mind? Perhaps you thought it had all been a dream? 
  Samper: Well, no. I felt as if a piano had been 
lifted off my head and an organ had been placed there instead. 
[sentence as heard] It was a sensation that is very difficult 
to describe. [passage omitted] 
  Zavarain: We now welcome Dr. Andres Pastrana. Good 
evening, Dr. Pastrana. 
  Pastrana: Good evening. 
  Zavarain: We have invited you to pay tribute to 
your campaign. After all, you received 3.5 million votes, the 
highest number of votes received by a conservative candidate in 
our history. We would like to know what you plan to do with all 
that electoral support. 
  Pastrana: I will continue working. The Colombian 
people have given me a mandate of 3.5 million votes, which is 50 
percent of the vote. Those 3.5 million votes are sending us a 
message. They say that change is possible, that it is possible 
to defeat the old policy, the machinery. They are telling us 
that the country wants to build a new Colombia. Therefore, we 
will work hard with those 3.5 million Colombians, and many more, 
to build the Colombia we want so much. 
  Unidentified reporter: Good evening, Dr. 
Pastrana. Last night, after acknowledging the partial results 
of the elections, you made a statement that has given rise to 
many doubts. I invite you to hear the recording. 
  Pastrana: Let us hear it. [Begin recording] 
  Pastrana: That is why I assured the country that a 
president who has received money from drug traffickers has no 
moral authority to lead Colombia. [end recording] 
  Reporter: Dr. Pastrana, what exactly did you mean? 
  Pastrana: You know that since Friday I have been 
deeply concerned because, a week ago, the international 
media--TIME magazine, and other U.S. media--published reports 
hinting that drug money was being used in the political 
campaign. During the previous campaign there were 18 
candidates, and I insisted that we all should send a note to the 
U.S. Government demanding clarification of who they were 
referring to. Later on, when only Dr. Samper and I were 
campaigning, the media insisted on saying that there was money 
from drug trafficking. Therefore, I sent a letter to Dr. Samper 
to tell him--as I said in my letter--that I have no knowledge of 
any funds from drug trafficking used in my campaign. Therefore, 
I swear before God and my conscience that I can say to 
Colombians that there were no such funds. I believed a reply to 
my letter from Dr. Samper was important to tell the world that 
there was no money from drug trafficking in our respective 
campaigns. 
  Reporter: You have specifically said that there 
was no money from drug trafficking in your campaign, and that 
there were only two candidates. Do you mean that Ernesto Samper 
has no moral authority to lead the country? 
  Pastrana: No, no. In my letter to Dr. Samper, I 
invited him to tell the world that if it was confirmed that 
there were funds from drug trafficking in either of our 
campaigns, that candidate would resign from the Colombian 
presidency because it would be an affront to the Republic and 
the nation. 
  Reporter: Did you receive a reply to that letter? 
  Pastrana: No, I have not received a reply, but I 
hope Dr. Samper... 
  Reporter, interrupting: Do you have proof that 
drug money was used in the electoral campaign? 
  Pastrana: No, no. I simply said that no such 
funds were used in my campaign, that I could swear before God 
and my conscience that those funds did not exist. I invited Dr. 
Samper to do the same so the world and the media would know that 
in Colombia there is no drug money in our campaigns. 
  Reporter: Will you participate directly in 
Samper's government? 
  Pastrana: I have not really thought about that 
yet. I am currently talking with our people. Whether we 
participate or not is not the real issue. My message to Dr. 
Samper is: We will support you in all the good things you do. 
Whenever we think we should criticize and contribute with our 
ideas, we will do so. We are not in favor of the old policy in 
the sense that if we are given a ministry, we will participate 
in the government. If the government does a good job and we 
believe that the results are good, Dr.Samper can be sure we will 
support him. We will also criticize the government when 
necessary. 
  Zavarain: Thank you, Dr. Pastrana. 
  Congote: Ines Maria, before going to more news, I 
would like to ask Dr. Ernesto Samper a question. Good evening, 
Dr. Samper; this is Gloria Congote. In view of Dr. Pastrana's 
proposal and to eliminate any doubts Colombians may have about 
you, would you truly be willing to resign from the presidency 
should it be discovered illegal funds were used in your campaign? 
  Samper: Gloria, I do not think resignation is the 
issue. I think the doubts expressed by Dr. Pastrana are 
reckless because they compromise, in one way or another, the 
entire country in the eyes of the nation [as heard]. I 
interpret it as an attempt to discredit the electoral results. 
Over the past few days, I have said emphatically that no drug 
money was used in my campaign. 
  As proof I described the ethics code that has guided us from 
the very beginning of the campaign, not just now at the end, as 
Dr. Pastrana suggested, but for the entire year. We implemented 
this code to keep an eye on all funds entering the national 
treasury. I want to invite any reporter or anyone at all who 
wants to review our books to check the origins of all funds. We 
adopted this institutional procedure a year ago to monitor where 
our resources were coming from. 
  Congote: Dr. Samper, why didn't you answer Dr. 
Pastrana's letter? 
  Samper: I answered it publicly. I received his 
letter two days after the media received it [chuckles]. I 
answered it as I told you, and I repeat: A year ago, ours was 
the first campaign team to worry about money of doubtful origin 
or about the concentration of resources in the campaign. That 
is why we established these procedures so we can show anyone our 
books and the origins of the funds. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Colombia is preparing to oppose all campaigns 
aimed at tarnishing and destabilizing the country. President 
Cesar Gaviria, political and private sector leaders, and average 
citizens all issued calls today for a defense of the nation's 
greatness and dignity. 
  Colombia is a large and good country, and most Colombians 
agree with this and oppose those antagonistic citizens who are 
attempting to drive us into pessimism. Not even our national 
soccer team's recent defeats or the calls of cowardice cloaked 
by anonymity will allow anxiety and uncertainty to return to 
Colombia. 
  Every Colombian agrees on one single truth: Colombia is 
greater that those who seek to destroy it. [begin recording] 
  President Cesar Gaviria: We must not allow the 
cartels to emerge victorious in what constitutes their main 
objectives: to divide allies in the struggle against organized 
crime. When judicial cooperation fails, the cartels win. When 
Colombia's image overseas is tarnished, the cartels win. When 
the credibility of our political leadership is attacked, the 
cartels win. The cartels are quite aware of this. 
  Vice President-elect Humberto De la Calle Lombana: 
As the president of the Republic pointed out, we also reject all 
of these malicious and ill-intended attacks whose ultimate 
victim will be Colombia. Over the past few days, these 
malicious and ill-intended attacks have been circulating 
throughout the foreign media. 
  Carlos Arturo Angel, president of the National 
Association of Industrialists: We will continue to work. 
We simply believe that these are unfortunate incidents which 
damage us, but they will not stain our country's name. This is 
a good country. A country of men and women who are determined 
to forge ahead at all times. 
  Ernesto Lima, president of the Lima Insurance Co.: 
I am quite certain the new administration will know how to 
direct the country toward very optimistic objectives. I am sure 
that the country, which has been properly directed in recent 
years, will continue to be directed adequately by Dr. Ernesto 
Samper. 
  Sabas Pretelt de la Vega, president of the National 
Federation of Businessmen: I do not believe that we should 
return to the past days of violence. The business sector is 
willing to support Colombia and the new administration in the 
state modernization process and in all of their attempts to 
strengthen Colombia's institutions. [passage omitted] [end

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Senator Alvaro Pava by </F>
unidentified station announcer in Santa Fe de Bogota and Caracol 
News Director Dario Arizmendi in Los Angeles, California; from 
"Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast--live] 
  [Text] Senator Alvaro Pava has been mentioned in a recorded 
conversation which, the government has admitted, included the 
participation of journalist Alberto Giraldo and the Rodriguez 
Orejuela brothers. The government, which has made a comparison, 
has confirmed the voices in the recording belong to them, 
according to a Defense Ministry communique. 
  During the conversation between Giraldo and one of the 
Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, Giraldo says he had already talked 
with Pava, who had everything arranged. Last night, the "CMI" 
television newscast even reported that Giraldo had telephoned 
the station saying he had received a message from Rodriguez 
Orejuela offering to finance the campaigns of Andres Pastrana 
and Ernesto Samper, an offer which neither of the two candidates 
accepted. According to the "CMI" newscast, Giraldo had said he 
had talked with Pava and Hernandez of the Pastrana campaign and 
Santiago Medina of the Samper campaign but that neither of the 
two campaigns accepted the money the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers 
had offered. 
  We have Pava on the telephone and will ask him what he has 
to 
say about this report linking him to this scandal of the alleged 
participation of tainted money to finance presidential 
campaigns. Good morning, Dr. Pava. 
  Pava: I am, of course, angry and shocked at the 
report that my name has been mentioned in connection with this 
type of conversation. I am particularly grieved by it. I have 
been listening to remarks by journalists and other people 
involved. The Attorney General's Office and control agencies 
that are determining the authenticity of the recording and the 
fact that it has been confirmed are likewise very important. I 
have known Giraldo for many years, as has the entire country. 
He is a respectable journalist and is a very important man 
socially. 
  As manager of Dr. Pastrana's campaign, I had no authority to 
collect any money. As Dr. Pastrana will surely explain during 
his news conference at 1000, such a collection was not my 
responsibility. 
  For the good of the country, institutions, and democracy, it 
is important to clarify this bothersome episode, which, 
nevertheless, mars the prestige of Colombian institutions. For 
the good of all, and as the president-elect has said, the 
Attorney General's Office should conduct a thorough 
investigation to confirm, as quickly as possible, that what I 
have said is the truth. It assuages me to know that remarks 
have been made affirming and clarifying the facts. I have 
nothing to fear, but I am very upset that my name was mentioned 
in the cassette. 
  Announcer: I will now connect you with our news 
director, Dario Arizmendi, who is in the United States. 
  Arizmendi: I would like you to answer a question 
that is surely in the minds of many fellow countrymen. When Dr. 
Pastrana made a speech at the Tequendama Hotel on 19 June 
admitting his defeat, did he already know of the existence of 
the cassette and that it involved the leaders of the Samper 
campaign in this money deal that was apparently being secured 
through journalist Giraldo? 
  Pava: Would you please repeat the question? 
  Announcer: Arizmendi's question is this: On 19 
June, when Pastrana said it was necessary to determine whether 
there was some participation of tainted money in the 
presidential elections, were the Pastrana campaigners aware of 
the existence of the cassettes disclosed today? 
  Pava: According to a Defense Ministry communique 
that was released last night, Dr. Pastrana personally handed the 
cassettes with the conversations to the president of the 
Republic on 16 June. An unidentified person had given him the 
cassettes in Cali; therefore, I believe it can be said that he 
was familiar with the text of those recordings and that for this 
reason he revealed them to the authorities so an investigation 
could be conducted. 
  Arizmendi: Is Giraldo's version as told to the 
"CMI" newscast true that he had talked with you and Dr. (Veliz) 
of the Pastrana campaign to present the offer of the Rodriguez 
Orejuela brothers to finance the campaign, an offer to which you 
replied no? 
  Pava: I am not familiar with that version. I could 
not say yes or no to something I did not handle. Giraldo must 
be regarded in the context of his life. You and the country 
know him. Let the people know that Alberto is a journalist who 
talks with political circles everyday. He has excellent 
relations. He is a friend of the president and all the 
ministers, former President Betancur, and the two presidential 
candidates. He has excellent relations and continually talks 
with the media. He is familiarly well-known as Crazy Man 
Giraldo due to his eccentricities. He is very well-known in the 
country. 
  He is always making inquiries, investigating campaigns. I 
had some responsibility in the campaign, and he was always 
asking me questions about the campaign. In addition, the 
country must know that since 1976 or 1977, he was attached to 
Cadena Radial Super, where I was deputy manager. He was 
assistant director for Javier Ayala, one of the leading Caracol 
journalists and his personal friend. You all know him. Let the 
people know that he is always talking with national leaders, has 
lunch and talks with people. 
  I have talked with Giraldo about the campaign many times but 
not on the subject of money. May I repeat that I had nothing to 
do with it. I did not have to handle that or any other matter 
in the campaign. Of course, morally speaking, I could not 
accept a conversation of that kind. It was proposed to me, and 
I turned it down, of course. I could not hold such a 
conversation for moral principles and because it was not my 
responsibility during the campaign. I did not have to manage 
anything regarding money. My responsibility was a different 
one, as Pastrana will surely affirm during his news conference. 
  Arizmendi: What will Pastrana say during his news 
conference today at 1000? 
  Pava: I do not know what he will say. You will 
have to ask him. I suppose he will explain the campaign's 
position, which has been very clear. Pastrana's position will 
not be changed either in his public or private life. I suppose 
this will be his position, but I do not know what he will tell 
the media that have been invited to his news conference at 1000. 
  Arizmendi: How do you interpret Giraldo's remarks 
that he talked with you and Dr. [name indistinct] to offer the 
money that you refused? 
  Pava: The Attorney General's Office will 
investigate this remark, which upsets me. I expect the Attorney 
General's Office and investigative agencies to establish the 
truth. May I repeat: I could not have accepted any such 
dialogue because it was not my responsibility. If it was 
proposed to me, surely I turned it down, because, morally 
speaking, I cannot accept such a dialogue for obvious reasons. 
  Arizmendi: What do you think of Samper's initial 
position? Are you satisfied with his explanation? 
  Pava: I believe the president-elect has spoken 
clearly. The two campaigns should ask the authorities to 
clarify this matter. From the viewpoint of the institutions, 
this speculation risks much regarding the institutions. The 
country requires absolute clarity on the subject. The president 
has spoken very clearly and has inspired confidence in the 
country regarding management of the money the campaign had used. 
We hope his assertion will coincide with the result of the 
investigation that the proper authorities will conduct.

<F P=106> [Report by the Ricardo Canon from "The Midday Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The next administration, through Vice 
President-elect Humberto de la Calle Lombana, today expressed 
its fullest support for President Cesar Gaviria in his 
initiative to call a referendum as the only solution to 
challenge attempts to decriminalize drug consumption in the 
country. [begin recording] 
  De la Calle: President Gaviria's proposal to call 
a referendum to reform the Constitution stems precisely from 
situations that we have observed. We, too, have questions about 
this ruling which today is a legal reality that can only be 
removed from the Colombian judicial scene by improving the 
Constitution. We applaud the government's decision on this 
issue. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, President Cesar Gaviria believes there is no way 
to implement Constitutional reforms other than through popular 
participation. 
  [Begin recording] 
  Gaviria: There is no other possible option, 
because, while it is true that, in the opinion of the court, the 
judicial measure allows legislators to regulate matters related 
to age, place, employment, and some other activities in which 
drug consumption takes place, unquote [as heard], this is not 
enough to ban or penalize drug consumption as a rule, which in 
our opinion should be the case. [end recording]

  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Samper has asked THE MIAMI 
HERALD to correct its position, and President Cesar Gaviria 
expressed his support for the president-elect. [begin recording] 
  Gutierrez: For the first time, President Gaviria 
talked about the attempt to infuse the presidential campaigns 
with drug trafficking money, as detailed by the recordings he 
received from Andres Pastrana four days prior to the elections. 
  Gaviria: All Colombians want a thorough 
investigation to yield results soon in order to dispel doubts. 
  Gutierrez: President Gaviria expressed support for 
the president-elect, who announced that, should he find out that 
any member of his team is involved, he would dismiss him from 
any post he might occupy in the government. 
  Meanwhile, Vice President-elect Humberto De la Calle, who is 
a member of the Promoters Committee for the Penalization of Drug 
Consumption, said the new administration will relentlessly fight 
drug traffickers. 
  De la Calle: First, we will continue the military 
and police fight against drug traffickers. 
  Gutierrez: There will also be new laws to penalize 
money laundering and appropriations. [end recording] 
  [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 0059 on 25 June transmits a 
175-word Santa Fe de Bogota-datelined report citing De la Calle 
as saying: "It will become a fight to arrest and make drug 
traffickers pay the debts they owe to Colombian society." The 
report adds: "The new government will submit two bills to 
increase drug traffickers' prison terms by means of a reform of 
the Penal Code, thereby closing the gap on `certain legal limbos 
and loose interpretations' that let criminals enjoy prison terms 
shorter than the ones they deserve. De la Calle also pointed 
out that the new administration will make money `laundering' a 
crime in Colombia and will seek international cooperation to 
trace the routes travelled by illegal money."]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 20 Jun (AFP) -- Liberal 
Ernesto Samper, Colombian president-elect, announced today that 
he will propose the creation of a binational cooperation 
commission with the United States to adopt joint strategies 
against drug trafficking. Samper added that he will accept "any 
technical support from this country" in that effort. 
  In a news conference with the foreign media in Colombia, 
Samper, who was elected president on Sunday after narrowly 
defeating his opponent, Conservative Andres Pastrana, insisted 
on the need to fight drug trafficking in a "global" and 
"comprehensive" manner. 
  "We are not the perpetrators but the victims of drug 
trafficking," he said, lamenting the fact that the international 
community continues to think the drug trafficking problem is 
exclusive to Colombia. 
  He said "it is imperative that we ensure greater 
effectiveness in the cooperation between Colombia and the United 
States" in this area. 
  Samper said the creation of a Colombian-U.S. commission, 
which would be made up of government and civilian 
representatives, would focus on permanently reviewing the 
cooperation policy, strengthening mutual trust, and ensuring the 
effectiveness of the various police, prevention, and 
rehabilitation programs. 
  He said the commission would work toward overcoming 
difficulties encountered by the two countries in their struggle 
against drug trafficking mafias, one example being the situation 
created by a recent Washington decision to withhold information 
obtained through U.S. radars in Colombia. 
  Samper said he hopes to maintain "clear, frank, honest, and 
firm cooperation" with the Clinton administration in the 
struggle against drug trafficking. 
  As for U.S. military aid to fight mafiosos in Colombia, 
Samper said he welcomes "any U.S. technical support for our 
counternarcotics efforts." 
  He also reaffirmed his disapproval of a recent ruling by the 
Constitutional Court legalizing the possession and consumption 
of minimum drug dosages in Colombia and announced that he is 
studying two legal alternatives to close the door on that ruling 
of the highest court, which is tasked with protecting the 
political Constitution. 
  Samper said he is studying the possibility of calling a 
referendum, as proposed by outgoing President Cesar Gaviria, or 
issuing a law to ban the use of drugs. 
  Samper, who will assume office on 7 August, announced that 
he 
will maintain the voluntary surrender policy for drug 
traffickers implemented by Gaviria but will introduce certain 
changes, especially in terms of the sentences imposed on capos 
who decide to surrender. 
  Samper said he will make the sentences tougher and will not 
allow mafiosos to take advantage of the accumulation of sentence 
reductions specified in the prison code for common criminals. 
Finally, the Colombian president-elect demanded "strong 
international cooperation" in the struggle against drug 
trafficking.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] On 24 May, the Attorney General's Office 
and the Colombian Banking Association (Asobancaria) concluded an 
agreement intended to strengthen the government's hand in 
detecting and fighting official corruption. The agreement will 
facilitate the examination of bank records by authorities 
looking for evidence of money obtained through illegal means. 
Specifically, the agreement provides for a smoother exchange of 
banking information between the Office of Special Investigations 
(OIE)--the department of the Attorney General's Office 
responsible for much of the preliminary investigative work in 
cases of administrative corruption--and Asobancaria, and will 
improve the latter's technical support to the OIE. (EL TIEMPO 25 
May; EL ESPECTADOR 26 May) President Cesar Gaviria, who 
attended the signing ceremony at the presidential palace, 
hailed the agreement as an "extremely important step forward" in 
coordinating efforts by the state and civil society to fight 
administrative corruption. He added that the accord is part of a 
larger strategy to prevent use of the country's financial system 
"to conceal investments or make use of resources obtained by 
means of illicit activities." Attorney General Carlos Gustavo 
Arrieta described the agreement as "a veritable revolution" in 
the struggle to fight illicit enrichment, and said it would 
"greatly reduce" investigation time. (EL TIEMPO 25 May) 
  Although financial institutions were already required to 
provide the Attorney General's Office with information upon 
request, the process whereby OIE investigators collected the 
data was time-consuming, subject to leaks, and did not always 
receive the full cooperation of bank officials, according to EL 
ESPECTADOR (26 May). By greatly streamlining procedures for 
gathering information and relaying it to the appropriate 
authorities, the new agreement could reduce OIE investigative 
work by as much as 75 percent, according to EL TIEMPO (25 May). 
  In a commentary in EL ESPECTADOR (29 May), Arrieta explained 
that the agreement eliminates the need for investigators to go 
from bank to bank, including individual branch offices, 
throughout the country searching for a suspect's accounts as 
well as those of family members or others which may have been 
used to conceal the illicit activity. Now, an investigator can 
simply report a suspect's name to Asobancaria's Center for 
Financial Sector Information (Cifin), which will be required 
quickly to provide all relevant information from its data bank 
of current information on accounts and transactions made at the 
country's financial institutions. (EL ESPECTADOR 29 May; EL 
TIEMPO 25 May) 
  In addition, the new procedures will help to ensure the 
confidentiality of investigations. Arrieta notes that, under the 
previous system, numerous bank officials were involved in 
responding to an OIE inquiry, increasing the risk that a suspect 
would be alerted to the investigation. Under the new system, 
however, each institution will appoint a representative to the 
Cifin working group who will be responsible for handling all 
requests for information from that institution. (EL TIEMPO 25 
May) 
  Addressing reports that bank officials had sometimes failed 
to cooperate fully with OIE investigators in the past, Arrieta 
said that in signing the agreement the financial system has 
"given its full commitment to the fight against corruption." (EL 
TIEMPO 25 May) 
  The agreement also calls for Asobancaria to provide 
investigators with training and ongoing assistance in 
understanding the more technical details of banking operations. 
Arrieta noted that such cooperation is especially important 
because criminals have refined their methods of concealing the 
illegal origin of their money. (EL ESPECTADOR 29 May) 
  Asobancaria and the Prosecutor General's Office are 
reportedly working out a similar agreement. (EL ESPECTADOR 26 
May)

  [Text] Yesterday, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff 
requested that Congress study the possibilities of establishing 
external controls on the immense power held by the institution 
he heads. He also asked the legislature to explore mechanisms 
to establish other types of precautionary measures, other than 
imprisonment, to ensure that those under investigation appear 
before prosecutors and judges. 
  The prosecutor general's requests were made yesterday during 
a seminar for criminal prosecutors organized by the Attorney 
General's Office. De Greiff, Attorney General Carlos Gustavo 
Arrieta, Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez, and Deputy Prosecutor 
General Francisco Sintura attended the seminar. 
  Regarding the first request, the prosecutor general said 
legislators had not established controls on "the great amount of 
power given to prosecutors and that it is necessary to establish 
controls for the future." 
  De Greiff said there is a 2d Court of Appeals at the 
Prosecutor General's Office, but this in itself is a 
contradiction because those who file suit in the 1st and 2d 
Courts of Appeals are delegates of the prosecutor general and 
belong to a body that has a unified administration, hierarchy, 
and follows general administrative procedures and criminal 
guidelines established by the prosecutor general of the 
Republic. "We respect this 2d Court of Appeals, because we do 
not attempt to have absolute power but, rather, one sole 
criminal policy, not many policies as in the past," the 
prosecutor general said. 
  Regarding precautionary measures, he said "arrest warrants 
must be issued as an exception and when we do not have a 
guarantee the person under investigation will present himself to 
the authorities. It is more appropriate to promote legislative 
reforms that will allow us other types of precautionary 
measures, such as bail," de Greiff said. 
  He admitted there are prosecutors who are quick to issue 
precautionary measures and involve people in cases. "Certain 
prosecutors are frequently quick to issue precautionary 
measures, and we have noticed people are precipitately involved 
many times in cases under investigation, as can be seen at 
inquiries when the prosecutor does not have all the necessary 
facts to ask questions," de Greiff added. 
  The prosecutor general also said the institutions can no 
longer allow validation of the assertion: "Nobody is refused an 
arrest warrant in Colombia." "This sentence is shocking and has 
been in effect since the time when there were criminal 
investigation judges." 
  The prosecutor general stated his position regarding a 
possible increase of jail sentences for several crimes and said 
increasing the penalties to the maximum is not the solution. 
The important thing is, he said, to have a penitentiary system 
that guarantees the rehabilitation of the criminal. "We gain 
nothing by putting all the hoods in jail if we do not have a 
penitentiary system that will give them a chance to 
rehabilitate," de Greiff said. 
<H5>  Arrest Warrants </H5>
  "Several people say the best system is the one in the United 
States, where drug traffickers are given long sentences or life. 
Let me tell you this is not true. Those penalties are imposed 
on Colombian drug traffickers, not U.S. drug traffickers. I do 
not know of a single case where a U.S. drug trafficker has been 
sentenced to life." 
  For his part, Arrieta said the Attorney General's Office 
should be committed to completing its investigations, that its 
role should expand and include the assurance that due process is 
complied with to safeguard respect for human rights, and that 
the law is interpreted and implemented correctly. "The main 
goal is to advance from formulating measures to restricting 
personal freedom to the point where such measures are only used 
when necessary to guarantee the appearance of those accused at 
court," the attorney general said. 
  According to Arrieta, personnel of the Attorney General's 
Office must be vigilant in stopping certain prosecutors' abuses 
of issuing preventive arrest warrants. "We must adapt Colombian 
criminal law to international laws that recommend freedom as a 
basic principle during the investigative phase and thus leave 
jails for those who are serving imposed sentences." 
  For his part, the justice minister said the current Criminal 
Procedures Code had improved the trial system because, according 
to him, it was an important instrument in inhibiting impunity, 
clearing the backlog in legal offices, and avoiding expiration 
of investigations. 
<H5>  No contacts with the Cali Cartel </H5>
  Yesterday, De Greiff and Arrieta said they have had no 
contacts with lawyers of important Cali Cartel members for 
several months. According to de Greiff, the Prosecutor General's 
Office is waiting for the Valle drug traffickers to understand 
that the best alternative is to surrender to justice and that 
his office is willing to further this process. Arrieta said 
"the Cali Cartel lawyers are most surely waiting for the change 
in government to reinitiate their advances." 
  The prosecutor general and the attorney general commented on 
other current national events: 
  The Hidden Microphones in Samper's Campaign: The prosecutor 
general said it is being investigated, "but it will be difficult 
to find the culprits in this crime due to a lack of evidence. 
We will investigate as much as possible." 
  Retirement Age: The prosecutor said he is waiting for the 
Supreme Court to define if he is an official with an established 
term or if he must retire when he is 65 years of age. 
  Church and Politics: The attorney general said the call made 
by several bishops for their parishioners to vote for one of the 
candidates is unjustified. "I believe Monsignor Castrillon's 
call was a personal one and did not include the church as a 
whole. Church interference in politics is something we have 
already surpassed. It does not have any justification at this 
time." 
  Disaster Attention Office: The attorney general said the 
Attorney General's Office will investigate as soon as the 
emergency subsides whether the officials in that government 
office had been negligent. "What is important now is attending 
to the victims. We will start to investigate once this phase is 
over. It would be senseless to do so now."

  [Text] Havana, 20 Jun (PL) -- Justice Minister Carlos Amat 
Fores has announced that Cuba will increase activities aimed at 
stopping the use of its airspace and territorial waters by 
international drug traffickers to ship drugs to the U.S. 
consumer market. 
  Cuba is waging a merciless fight against drug traffickers, 
Amat said in an interview with BOHEMIA magazine. In the 
interview, Amat stressed Cuba's willigness to cooperate with 
other nations in combating the trafficking of hallucinogens. 
  Amat said the island's adverse economic situation following 
the loss of its traditional markets in the former European 
socialist camp has not noticeably affected the nation's drug 
prevention programs. 
  On the contrary, by virtue of our experience and the maximum 
use of our available resources, we have increased our 
effectiveness and zeal in surveillance, Amat remarked. 
  Amat said that because of its geographic position Cuba is 
located on a direct line between the world's main drug consumer 
market--the United States--and the primary drug producing 
regions in South America. 
  He said drug traffickers are continuing their modus operandi 
in Cuba, mainly tossing packages of drugs into the sea to be 
picked up later by accomplices. Frequently, these packages are 
carried by the ocean currents onto the island's shores. 
  Amat said that last year a total of 79 packages containing 
3,364.39 kg of drugs washed up on Cuban beaches. This 
represented a 104 percent increase over 1992. 
  In terms of international cooperation in the fight against 
this scourge, he pointed out that over the past two years Cuba 
has signed agreements with Mexico, Venezuela, Barbados, Guyana, 
and Argentina, as well as a letter of intent with Colombia. 
  Amat said some unofficial contacts have continued with the 
United States. These contacts have resulted in certain kinds of 
bilateral cooperation, such as the exchange of information and 
evidence, and even the handing over of people implicated in a 
drug trafficking case. 
  Amat said: We think U.S. professionals in this field are 
more 
and more interested in these relationships, and so are we.

  [Text] Quito, 22 Jun (EFE) -- The top 14 executives of 
Banco de los Andes, including its chairman, Rear Admiral 
Guillermo Duenas (retired), and its attorney [procurador], 
Chilean Gonzalo Huidobro, were arrested for alleged ties to the 
"laundering" of properties from drug trafficking. The two were 
jailed a few hours ago, the local news media have reported. 
  Duenas, owner and chairman of the bank board of directors, 
is 
allegedly linked to the "laundering" of properties of more than 
20 members of the Reyes family, Pichincha Police Superintendent 
Boanerges Villagomez confirmed today. 
  According to the police, the so-called group "Three Magi" 
[Los Tres Reyes Magos], headed by wealthy businessman Victor 
Hugo Reyes, who is under arrest, was the only organization with 
the characteristics of a "cartel" in Ecuador and was dismantled 
two years ago. The Reyes family has been facing drug 
trafficking charges since then. 
  At least a dozen people, including certain retired officers 
and executives of a local airline, have been charged with these 
offenses. 
  According to Ecuadoran law, any offense related to 
trafficking or "laundering" of money obtained through the 
illicit drug trade brings with it imprisonment for the accused 
until found innocent. 
  The charges against Duenas are based on a report by a 
special 
congressional commission, the police, and the Bank 
Superintendency, which also ordered the imprisonment of Huidobro. 
  Duenas was arrested a few hours ago in the main building of 
his bank in Quito during a discreet operation that involved 
uniformed and plainclothes policemen. In a statement from the 
Provisional Detention Center, Duenas said that his arrest "is 
illegal and unjustifiable" and that he will give fuller details 
in the coming hours. 
  Bank Superintendent Ricardo Munoz has asked the bank's 
170,000 customers to remain calm, because "neither the bank's 
solvency nor immediate liquidity is adversely affected by the 
arrests." Banco de los Andes has $72.5 million in deposits and a 
portfolio estimated at more than $85 million. "The 
investigations," he said, "are directed at events that occurred 
from 1989 to 1990, and so the bank's current status is not at 
risk." He added "there should not be a run on the country's 
banks, because the Ecuadoran financial system is solid and 
handled with great professionalism and seriousness." 
  According to Munoz, Rear Admiral Duenas had charged 
investigations were not conducted by order of Congress but, 
rather, based on exigencies of the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration and the U.S. Embassy. News reports have stated 
Duenas also owns at least 52 companies in different sectors, 
magazines, television production companies, advertising 
agencies, and shares in several Ecuadoran newspapers.

  [Text] Two people were arrested for possession of 
"capsules" of heroin, a case considered the first of this type 
in El Salvador. 
  Juan Ernesto Vaengas Henriquez, 42, and Adrian Antonio Rodas 
Guevara, 46, were arrested by the Narcotics Division of the 
National Civilian Police and are accused of transporting 48 
white, powdered pills encased in plastic. Upon analysis, these 
pills were determined to be heroin. 
  The gross weight is estimated at 246.8 grams with an 
estimated street value of 129,579 colones. 
  According to the police report, the arrest was made on 13 
June when the individuals were traveling by motorcycle, license 
plate No. M-25-171, down 79th Avenida Norte in the western 
neighborhood of Escalon. 
  The police claim that the two had said they were involved in 
drug trafficking and that international drug traffickers had 
delivered to them the confiscated packages to be marketed in the 
country. 
  Meanwhile, the detained have denied the charges, saying 
"they 
never had anything to do with that type of business." 
  Venegas has said he was an unemployed driver. He had on him 
almost 300 colones when the seizure was made. 
  Rodas Guevara, who has held several jobs, a resident of San 
Bartolo, Ilopango, had 30 colones in cash on him at the time of 
arrest. Both individuals were placed at the disposal of the 5th 
Penal Court of San Salvador. 
  According to chemists, heroin is a drug stronger than 
cocaine 
and is priced at an estimated $60 per gram as opposed to $25 per 
gram for cocaine. 
  The main laboratories for the production of heroin in Latin 
America are found in underground operations in Mexico, some in 
Guatemala, and lately some in Colombia. The drug is extracted 
from the plant know as poppy through very sophisticated 
procedures. Addicts use it through injections, diluted in water, 
or in special liquids. 
  This is the first time, as we stated, heroin has been 
uncovered in Salvador.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 21 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today announced a "hardline" 
policy against drug trafficking, terrorism, general violence, 
and the seizure of land, which "discourages" investments. 
  The president said his administration will firmly act to 
dissuade "covert groups" that seek to sow anarchy and unrest in 
the country in order "to subsequently destabilize the 
government." 
  De Leon Carpio said he will not have the national and 
international community believe he heads a weak government that 
is overwhelmed by corruption and infiltrated by drug trafficking. 
  During a visit to the outskirts of the capital, the 
president 
said he will end the country's anarchy, which is reflected by 
high crime rates, kidnappings, and attacks against the 
infrastructure. 
  "We are going to respond with the law in our hands, because 
we have a strong government now. There will be respect for 
freedoms and rights in the fight against various crimes," the 
former human rights ombudsman said. 
  The Guatemalan president reiterated "there are covert 
groups" 
that seek to destabilize his administration by seizing land. "I 
am going to respond to the demands of the Guatemalan people, who 
no longer want violence, bloodbaths, and armed confrontations," 
de Leon said. The president has been in office since 6 June 
1993. The Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity (URNG) have been negotiating for several 
months to sign a peace agreement that will end the more than 
30-year-old armed conflict. 
  "I am going to punish those responsible for public 
insecurity," the president warned. He has been severely 
criticized by political opponents due to the wave of 
kidnappings, dynamite attacks, threats, and generalized violence 
in the streets. 
  Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia has said that 
after 
one year in office, de Leon has yet to respond to the general 
clamor for an end to the attacks and violence, which bring 
mourning to the country. Guatemalan Indian leader Rigoberta 
Menchu, who received the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, has expressed 
her "disillusionment" over the current administration.

  [Excerpts] Nearly 1,800 military men could be transferred 
to the civilian security forces once they are trained to protect 
the people, the defense minister, General Mario Rene Enriquez, 
said yesterday. 
  According to the minister, the number of police members 
should be increased, and the police have to be properly trained 
and equipped to meet society's demands for protection. 
  He also said the reorganization plan devised by the Army for 
those times when there is no counterinsurgency work to do 
includes the relocation of units. For instance, seven military 
detachments could be deployed in Peten Department to protect 
natural resources. [passage omitted] 
  The minister believes Guatemala is ceasing to be a 
springboard for international drug trafficking. A positive sign 
is the use of drugs is not as common as in other countries. 
  We have not captured a single plane, from Colombia or 
wherever, carrying cocaine during the past few months. The drug 
capos have apparently departed for another country, he said. 
  The minister said drug trafficking continues over land and 
sea, albeit at much lower levels, as the result of the security 
forces' coordinated efforts. 
  Concerning arms trafficking, the minister said an arms cache 
recently discovered in Suchitepequez with 22 AK-47 rifles in 
perfect condition proves the URNG [National Guatemalan 
Revolutionary Unity] does not lack arms but, rather, militant 
members.

  [Text] Haitian Charge d'Affaires Georges Barberousse told 
LA PRENSA that he has confirmed during his stay in Panama that 
there is a connection between Haitian military leaders and drug 
trafficking. 
  Barberousse pointed out that Panamanian authorities recently 
seized at Coco Solo Pier, Colon, two vessels bound for 
Port-au-Prince. More than 1,000 kg of cocaine were found in the 
vessels' holds, thus revealing a criminal connection. 
  As for the sanctions adopted by the OAS against the Raul 
Cedras military regime and the Panamanian Government's 
compliance with those sanctions, the Haitian charge d'affaires 
said he had received no official notification whatsoever. 
  The diplomat added: "If this is the Panamanian Government's 
position, the embassy approves of it with satisfaction, because 
that is the kind of attitude the international community is 
taking to solve the Haitian crisis." 
  Questioned on the imminent military invasion of his country, 
just as happened in Panama, Barberousse emphasized that the 
official position of Jean-Bertand Aristide's government's is not 
to support a military incursion in Haiti, but he understands the 
Panamanians' position on the issue. 
  The Haitian official also said that now is not the time for 
a 
military invasion but for the implementation of peaceful 
measures to settle disputes. That is the path that the 
international community is taking, thereby coinciding with the 
interests of the constitutional government. 
  Barberousse said: "What we really want is for the Haitian 
military to leave power, and that is what we are aiming for 
through the implementation of sanctions, which, we hope, will 
become more effective every day." 
  As for Panama, he reported that the Haitian Embassy this 
week 
sent a note to the Panamanian Foreign Ministry requesting a 
meeting with the foreign minister to discuss the implementation 
of sanctions and the cooperation the Panamanian Government has 
offered Haitians so far.

  [Text] The Attorney General's Office [PGR] has undertaken a 
direct and decisive struggle against drug consumption. The PGR, 
which is headed by Humberto Benitez Trevino, has begun a 
campaign in Mexico City to prevent crime. The sale, 
distribution, and consumption of drugs are the first of a number 
of federal crimes about which citizens will receive information. 
For this purpose, the PGR has distributed posters in 
discotheques and restaurants in Mexico City, especially in the 
Zona Rosa, which is usually crowded with young people. The 
posters have been placed mainly in rest rooms and have the 
objective of making known to youths the dangers that the 
consumption and sale of drugs represent. 
  In the next few days, this crime prevention campaign will be 
extended to the entire country and will deal with various 
crimes, such as the illegal possession of firearms and theft of 
archaeological artifacts. The colorful posters have the 
objective of preventing rather than just lamenting crimes. The 
struggle against drug addiction must begin from childhood and 
continue with greater intensity during adolescence.

  [Text] Culiacan, Sinaloa, 20 Jun -- Virgilio de la Fuente 
Ruiz, director of the National Counternarcotics Institute 
(INCD), has reported that an operation involving 41 federal 
agents was implemented today in the mountainous areas of the 
States of Sinaloa, Durango, and Chiahuahua to intensify the 
struggle against drug trafficking. 
  He also said the INCD has eight agents highly qualified in 
the area of investigation, who will work full-time to determine 
the activities, whereabouts, and money laundering activities of 
Sinaloa's most important drug traffickers and drug producers. 
The official said that the 41 federal agents are part of a 
select group of investigators, adding that they were taken in 
helicopters to bases the Attorney General's Office (PGR) has set 
up in mountainous areas. 
  The official stressed that authorities will investigate 
those 
who finance the production of narcotics, because the aim is to 
specifically punish those who provide the financial resources, 
not so much drug couriers. The INCD director asserted that 
authorities have detected some marijuana and poppy plantations 
in the mountains dividing Durango, Chihuahua, and Sonora. 
  Meanwhile, Antonio Figueroa Lee, president of the Alberto 
Sanchez Gonzalez Bar Association, affirmed that the PGR must 
improve the process of selecting agents to effectively fight 
drug trafficking.

<F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] In an incident described by the PGR [Attorney 
General's Office] as one of the harshest blows dealt to the drug 
trafficking mafia, on 15 June authorities arrested Moises Juarez 
Ledezma, alias El Moyo and El Dienton, a key figure in the 
Sonora Cartel headed by Amado Carrillo Fuentes. El Moyo has 
been charged with crimes against public health, which include 
charges of funding, planting, cultivating, storing, and 
transporting drugs. 
  In the areas of Las Minitas and Las Trincheras in Sonora, 
which cover some 5,800 hectares, authorities confirmed the 
discovery of caps and jackets with bogus PGR and PJF [Federal 
Judicial Police] insignias, which were used by cartel members. 
  Meanwhile, the PGR also announced the arrest on 12 June of 
Eduardo Salazar Carrillo, assistant PJF inspector in Sinaloa; 
Commander 2d Class Cesar Gomez Castaneda; and policemen Gilberto 
Barrios Barrios and Eric Escamilla Segovia. The four men are 
facing charges in connection with the possession of $306,921 in 
cash, several weapons used exclusively by the Army, and radio 
equipment.

  [Text] With the conviction that drug trafficking is a 
worldwide problem that should be attacked jointly, the Mexican 
state has called for the establishment of a common front to 
combat this activity, because drug trafficking needs to be 
combated with great efforts and increasingly larger economic and 
human resources, the Attorney General's Office (PGR) has stated. 
  Thus, Mexico and the United States must continue to support 
joint strategies without violating the sovereignty of either 
country to combat drug trafficking. 
  During the inauguration of a training course for PGR agents, 
at installations of the FBI Academy in Virginia, the United 
States, Rene Paz Horta, National Counternarcotics Institute 
(INCD) commissioner, said the intensification of efforts and the 
support of other nations strengthen the task of combating drug 
trafficking and related crimes, which he described as "among the 
most serious scourges of humanity." 
  Representing Attorney General Humberto Benitez Trevino, who 
is responsible for counternarcotics efforts in the country, Paz 
said the training of PGR agents will help find solutions to this 
problem and reflects the two countries' willingness to cooperate. 
  During the ceremony to inaugurate courses for PGR agents at 
the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, Paz said Mexico and the 
United States must continue to promote joint strategies, without 
violating the sovereignty of either nation, to fight drug 
trafficking. 
  The INCD commissioner said there is a firm conviction that 
drug trafficking is a worldwide problem that must be confronted 
jointly. He added this experience reinforces the hope of 
establishing a united front to combat this type of crime while 
respecting each other, their ethical values, and the law. 
  He added the Mexican state headed by President Carlos 
Salinas 
de Gortari has promoted the establishment of a common front 
against crime, because the antidrug fight requires tremendous 
efforts and increasingly larger economic and human resources. 
  Paz said it is painful to see thousands of human beings, 
particularly young ones, fall victim to drugs. He highlighted 
the need to expand rehabilitation programs for adults as well as 
the people's participation in preventive efforts.

<F P=106> [Article by Freddy Potoy] </F>
  [Text] Brigadier Commander Eduardo Cuadra Ferrey, acting 
director of the National Police, has confirmed to BARRICADA that 
an avalanche of drugs coming from the Atlantic coast of 
Nicaragua is being received by a network of drug traffickers in 
Masaya and other departments on the Pacific coast. 
  The cocaine invading the Pacific coast cities comes from 
Puerto Cabezas. It is smuggled through Minas, Mulukuku, 
Matagalpa, and Tipitapa, to Ciudad de las Flores, where 
traffickers have managed to infiltrate the police force and 
where several police officers are in charge of distribution. 
This activity has changed this city into the capital of drug 
trafficking. 
  The cocaine seized in Nicaragua is classified as "Lacross," 
"Esterlina," and "The First." "Lacross" is cocaine that experts 
rate as "medium grade," and its price makes it more readily 
available to consumers. The traffickers receive it in Masaya 
and distribute it in eastern towns and other areas. 
  Drug traffickers are believed to have moved their operations 
center to one of the major cities outside Managua, where there 
are excellent market possibilities due to population and 
facilities for moving into other areas along the Pacific coast. 
  Drug traffickers also may have moved their operations 
because 
of the recent crack downs in the capital. Authorities have 
delivered severe blows to large and small-scale drug sales, 
capturing and prosecuting anyone who "sticks their head up." 
  Cuadra Ferrey said his office will initiate an in-depth 
investigation of the police implicated in the Masaya drug 
trafficking activities. "If they are found guilty, they will be 
prosecuted, because we cannot allow drug trafficking." 
  Donald Sanchez, Virgilo Canales, Mario Vergara and 
Lieutenant 
Pablo Potosme are the police officers allegedly implicated in 
drug trafficking activities. 
  After repeatedly asking Sub Commander Carlos Rodriguez, 
chief 
of the National Police in Masaya, for information regarding the 
men said to be involved in drug trafficking activities, he 
finally told BARRICADA that Potosme is currently being 
investigated by military internal affairs for providing 
information to drug traffickers in exchange for payoffs. 
  It was discovered that Potosme was receiving payments from 
one of the biggest criminals in Masaya, who was recently 
arrested for fraud and bribery of a policeman. The former 
police officer is also charged with having sold information for 
600, 700, 1,000, 2,000, and even 3,000 cordobas. Reportedly, he 
once took a television set from one of the traffickers, because 
the trafficker had no money to pay him at the time. 
  On another occasion, a police officer gave Potosme a ride to 
the Parque de los Leones. According to National Police 
investigations, Potosme then went to the Masaya criminal's home 
to receive a payoff. 
  Although Cuadra Ferrey and Rodriguez gave no significant 
details of the investigations, BARRICADA was able to learn the 
names of four other police officers believed to be under 
investigation. 
  Our informant said that Police Officers Dino Shelleby, 
Ernesto Chamorro, and Eliphar Villaobos are reportedly drug 
users, "although they are still not involved in the drug 
business itself." 
  Police officer Francisco Valdez is under investigation for 
his relations with former police officer Francisco Malespin, who 
is to be sentenced by a military court in the next few days 
after being found guilty of drug trafficking. 
  Several police officers have been seen at a distribution 
point, near the Salinas movie theater in Managua, allegedly 
consuming drugs or receiving payoffs. 
  Sources close to the National Police high command reported 
that "they are bringing in all kinds of weapons to Masaya and 
Managua to fight the police officers connected with the drug 
traffickers and to prosecute whoever they find to be involved."

  [Excerpts] Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo announced 
yesterday that the military naval fleet will be expanded to 
"guard our seas and coasts" from smugglers, pirates, and drug 
traffickers. 
  The announcement was made during a meeting with 
representatives of the fishing, business, labor, livestock, and 
transportation sectors, as well as the mayors of the Northern 
Atlantic Autonomous Region [RAAN]. During the meeting held at 
the National Technological Institute installations in Puerto 
Cabezas, Minister Lacayo responded to concerns voiced by 
representatives of the Moravian and Adventist Churches regarding 
the drug problem, which is affecting the area's population, 
especially youths. 
  Lacayo's decision triggered thunderous applause from 
attendees at the meeting, which was held following a private 
meeting between Lacayo and delegates of government institutions 
in the RAAN. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Panama's credibility and good intentions in the 
fight against drug trafficking are being questioned 
internationally due to the indifference of the National 
Assembly, which for all practical purposes will be unable to 
hold a third debate on the reforms to Law no. 23 of the Penal 
Code. 
  Despite the efforts of the public prosecutor's office, the 
opinion held by U.S. agencies--that Panama is not complying with 
its international commitment against drug trafficking--is being 
justified. 
  Attorney General Jorge Ramon Valdes deplored the situation 
in 
a statement to LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA and he said that "one 
cannot fight against drug trafficking without the necessary 
legal instruments." 
  Valdes added that the skepticism--mainly on the part of the 
United States--concerning Panama's will to meet in earnest its 
commitments to various agencies throughout the world is 
understandable. 
  On 11 April, a bill to reform the law, which dates back to 
30 
December 1986, was submitted for a second debate. Among the 
reforms being considered is the creation of two prosecutor 
offices specializing in drug-related crimes. 
  The prosecutor offices will have authority and jurisdiction 
throughout Panama. The reforms also would permit the use of a 
legal framework for adequate procedures to be used in the fight 
against drug trafficking, such as undercover operations and drug 
exchange surveillance. 
  All indications are that with the end of the regular session 
of the legislative assembly only 15 days away, it will be almost 
impossible to discuss the bill, which would amend the current 
law to conform with the Vienna Convention. 
  We should mention this reform is the same one Panama 
presented before the OAS, the UN, and other agencies dedicated 
to the fight against drugs. 
  On 9 March, during the 15th ordinary session of the OAS 
Interamerican Drug Abuse Control Commission [CICAD], which was 
held in Argentina, Attorney General Ramon Valdes, speaking on 
behalf of Panama, promised to take action in that respect.

  [Text] 
<H5>  Why We Should Struggle Against Money Laundering </H5>
  Money is of vital importance for all legitimate trade and 
industrial activity, but it is even more important for criminal 
activity. The constant flow of illegally obtained money through 
the international banking and financial systems is fundamental 
for criminal organizations as a means of obtaining funds 
necessary in financing their operations and in providing new 
capital for their expansion. Therefore, the interruption of the 
flow of money to criminal organizations is of utmost importance 
in weakening and eventually eradicating them. The illegal and 
criminal nature of money laundering is the main reason why the 
Republic of Panama, its government, and its people should 
decidedly combat money laundering. In addition, an analysis of 
the methods through which criminal organizations gradually take 
over a nation's economy shows that this struggle is an urgent 
necessity in safeguarding the future of our nation. 
  This is the danger that looms over Panama and how it could 
occur: 
  1. Infiltration in legitimate companies. Criminals 
and drug traffickers, in particular, manage their businesses as 
large corporations. The only difference between these illegal 
operations and legitimate ones is that the illegal operations 
have an enormous competitive advantage: They do not obey any 
law. This advantage, in addition to their international 
contacts and vast financial and coercive power, allows them to 
acquire legitimate companies which are then used to conceal 
illegal operations. In this way, they gradually infiltrate 
every sector of the economy. 
  2. Concentration of economic power. The gradual 
subjection of legitimate companies in key sectors of the 
economy, along with the great amount of illegally earned capital 
that can be used to expand illicit operations, creates a 
concentration of economic power that subsequently can spill into 
other investments and economic sectors. Eventually, these might 
infiltrate political and government circles, and this would have 
serious implications for the nation's future security and its 
political and moral stability. 
  3. Money laundering as an ill-fated function in the 
economy. The final stage of money laundering is reached 
when illegally earned capital replaces domestic and foreign 
investment in funding economic expansion. At the same time, 
this surreptitiously harms the very foundations of the banking 
sector, the stock exchange, and the financial system. The risk 
of this happening is especially high in an economy such as 
Panama's--one that lacks resources and, in turn, is eager for 
investments. 
<H5>  Corporations, Money, the Banking System, and the Free Zone: </H5>
  Given its geographic location and the configuration and 
extension of its territory, Panama has historically been a 
center of trade and transit. Although growth can be obtained in 
other areas, it is unlikely that Panama will turn into an 
agricultural, mining, or manufacturing power. Our greatest 
development potential in the immediate future seems to be in the 
sustained growth of maritime and tourism services while 
maintaining a healthy monetary infrastructure in banking and 
international trade. As a result, services have been identified 
as our best natural means of encouraging the nation's economic 
growth. 
  Our service economy is based on our geographic location and 
the Panama Canal. In addition to this, Panama features four 
areas that are essential for today's service economy but, at the 
same time, are also threatened in various ways: 
  --the Law on Corporations, which was approved in 1927; 
  --the monetary system, which dates back to 1904; 
  --the banking system, which was created in 1970; 
  --and the Colon Free Zone, which was organized in 1946. 
  The threats facing these four areas of our service economy 
stem from two sources: 
  --from some sectors of the international community aimed at 
limiting their effectiveness and ending their existence; 
  --attempts by criminal organizations to use these areas to 
benefit their illegal activities. 
  It is obvious that Panama did not create these institutions 
to have them used for criminal activities. This is why Panama 
has the obligation to improve, control more efficiently, and 
finally defend these institutions to enable them to continue 
being useful for honest businessmen in an economy that is 
fundamentally service-based and whose structure will not change 
dramatically for a long time. 
<H5>  Evaluation of Achievements: </H5>
  Drug traffickers and other criminal organizations use 
incredibly advanced techniques and employ professionals with 
broad knowledge of banking and financial affairs, with access to 
the latest technologies of electronic banking and instant 
communications to conduct operations beyond national borders. 
Therefore, international cooperation is imperative to prepare 
and coordinate measures that will make possible an effective 
struggle against money laundering. 
  As part of these efforts, the 1989 Economic Summit created 
the Financial Action Task Force, better known by its English 
acronym FATF, formed originally by 26 countries that are sites 
of financial centers. Panama subsequently joined it as a member 
of the Caribbean subgroup. In May 1990, the FATF adopted 40 
recommendations on measures to counter money laundering, based 
on the 1988 Vienna Convention. Fulfillment or adoption of these 
40 recommendations currently constitutes the best means to 
evaluate progress in these struggles, and, in fact, in April 
1991 the member countries agreed that their comparative progress 
in this regard will be evaluated by experts from the group. In 
Panama's case, an objective evaluation reviewing these 
recommendations and other facts would reveal the following: 
  1. Panama ratified the Vienna Convention in December 1993 
and 
is in the process of implementing those articles that are not 
included in Panamanian legislation. (Recommendation No. 1). 
  2. Panama's banking confidentiality laws do not involve 
absolute secrecy as it is made to appear to locals and 
foreigners. Panamanian laws unquestionably permit authorities 
access to confidential information through the proper judicial 
institutions in the presence of suspicious criminal activity. 
(Recommendation No. 2). 
  3. Panama accepts international assistance and coordination 
against criminal activities, as can be confirmed by the recent 
mutual legal assistance treaties negotiated with the United 
Kingdom, Colombia, Canada, and Central America and the initial 
negotiations with Mexico. In July 1991, Panama ratified a 
similar treaty with the United States, which has yet to ratify 
it. (Recommendation No. 3). 
  4. Through Law No. 23 of 1986, Panama defined as a crime the 
improper use of banking transactions. In addition to the 
criminal liability that this crime entails, Law No. 23 also 
establishes the civil liability of the individual or his 
employer. In addition to the transactions made in Panama, this 
definition also includes those originating in Panama and 
perfected abroad, with knowledge, through an individual or 
intervening person. Lastly, Law No. 23 and its reforms will 
permit the seizure and confiscation of assets or instruments 
related to the criminal action. (Recommendations Nos. 4 and 5). 
  5. There is no official agency with sufficient authority and 
responsibility to define, coordinate, and implement actions 
against money laundering. The vacuum caused by the absence of 
such an agency cannot currently be filled by the National 
Banking Commission because of legal, technical, and budgetary 
limitations. This constitutes one of the most serious 
limitations Panama has in the struggle against laundering. 
(Recommendations Nos. 9-11). 
  6. Cabinet Decree No. 41 of February 1990 establishes as an 
obligation the identification of the client and registration of 
transactions in cash and negotiable instruments. This decree is 
the source of authority that permitted the National Banking 
Commission to issue Resolutions Nos. 5-90 and 1-91 regulating 
the banks' obligation to know their clients and maintain a 
registry of transactions in cash and negotiable payment 
instruments. Unfortunately, the National Banking Commission does 
not have the resources to create an automatized database to 
adequately handle this information. (Recommendations Nos. 12-14). 
  7. Decree No. 41 and the relevant resolutions do not 
explicitly address the problem of complex or uncommon 
transactions or the topic of patterns or trends of infrequent or 
unusual transactions. Decree No. 41 also does not address the 
banks' responsibility to investigate these types of transactions 
to establish their origin or purpose. (Recommendation No. 15). 
  8. Regarding dubious transactions, the Penal Code stipulates 
that banks and their employees are required to tell the relevant 
authorities about them under penalty of harboring criminal 
activities. However, there is no legal precedent in Panamanian 
courts that protects the institution or its employees from civil 
or criminal responsibility for violating banking secrecy laws in 
these cases. In addition, in terms of suspicious activities, no 
law requires that banks terminate their relation with the 
client. Finally, no legal precept requires banks to implement 
procedures including controls, screening procedures, policies, 
and training and internal audit programs against money 
laundering. This lack of clear guidelines on the policies banks 
should adopt to prevent domestic or international money 
laundering curtails the confidence with which banks can act 
regarding compliance with their legal obligations against money 
laundering (Recommendation Nos. 16-22). 
  9. Panama has implemented additional measures to avert money 
laundering, including the cash transactions declaration and the 
internal promotion of alternative forms of payment such as 
checks, credit cards, direct deposits of salaries, and other 
transactions that replace the use of cash. However, although 
Decree 41 requires that transactions larger than $10,000 must be 
registered, it does not include electronic international 
transfers, nor does it require the creation of a national data 
bank operating under a separate government agency that 
guarantees its proper use (Recommendation Nos. 23-25). 
  10. Panama has not sufficiently strengthened the role of the 
National Banking Commission as a coordinating organization to 
prevent and investigate money laundering since the National 
Banking Commission does not extend its controls to other 
institutions that manage considerable amounts of money such as 
casinos, money-changing offices, and transfer agencies. The 
National Banking Commission lacks the resources and the 
authority to introduce, in all banks, adequate programs to 
prevent money laundering or measures to detect any suspicious 
behavior by clients. The National Banking Commission does have 
and does exercise the authority to prevent criminal parties from 
owning a majority of stocks in banking institutions 
(Recommendation Nos. 26-29). 
  11. As for the strengthening of international cooperation 
efforts against money laundering, Panama has showed willingness 
to participate at both the bilateral and multilateral levels 
within its current legal parameters and financial limitations. 
The exchange of general information by relevant authorities, 
except areas related to dubious transactions, cooperation 
between judicial and legal authorities, and mutual assistance in 
investigations through the corresponding legal and diplomatic 
means, should improve as bilateral agreements come into force 
(Recommendation Nos. 30-40). 
  As part of an objective evaluation, actions by the Panama 
Banking Association that reinforce or complement achievements by 
the national government should not be downplayed. A brief list 
of these actions reveals that this Banking Association adopted 
in 1984, through an interbanking agreement, the Code of Conduct 
on Banking Operations, which was reformed in 1985 and 1986; 
joined in 1989 the Declaration of Principles of the 
International Bank for Clearing House Activities in Basel, 
Switzerland; prepared in 1992 and updated in 1993 a guideline 
for banks to prevent the improper use of their services; 
conducted in 1992 and 1993 training and information seminars on 
preventing money laundering jointly with authorities of the 
Treasury Department, Justice Department, DEA, Financial Crime 
Enforcement Network, and U.S. Postal Service; conducted jointly 
with the National Banking Commission in 1992 and 1993 a study to 
establish, as was done, consistence between the information on 
cashflows and the remittances of excess cash to the U.S. Federal 
Reserve; adopted in March 1993 Interbanking Agreement No. 28, 
which determines the order of endorsements on checks and 
facilitates audits thereof; adopted in June 1993 Interbanking 
Agreement No. 29, which regulates the acceptance of alternate 
documents for negotiable payment and the criteria to send and 
receive remittances of bank transfers. 
<H5>  Recommendations </H5>
  Additional measures that the Panamanian public sector as 
well 
as the private sector should take to combat money laundering 
must result from Panamanian analysis--an analysis that must take 
place within the domestic arena, while maintaining cooperation 
with other nations. This analysis should focus on what is 
needed to help us wage an efficient struggle against money 
laundering. This analysis should also result from our 
philosophical conviction that this struggle is ethical, moral, 
and economically prudent for Panama. 
  In terms of its internal policies, the Panama Banking 
Association proposes: 
  1. to bring up to date its Code of Conduct on Banking 
Operations; 
  2. to improve, wherever possible, the "Guide for Banks To 
Prevent the Misuse of Services" [Guia a los Bancos Para Prevenir 
el Uso Indebido de Sus Servicios]; 
  3. to defend our customers' rights to confidentiality in 
legitimate business transactions, as provided for under our 
legislation; 
  4. and to combat the abuse of confidentially by 
organizations 
or individuals devoted to criminal activity. 
  The Panama Banking Association recommends to Panama's 
executive, legislative, and judicial powers: 
  1. The creation of a working group with a mandate to design 
a 
national policy against money laundering; this working group 
should comprise representatives of the Attorney General's 
Office, the National Banking Commission, and the Legislative 
Assembly's Drug Commission. 
  2. The endowing of the National Banking Commission with the 
technical, legal, and budgetary resources to carry out the 
integration, execution, and coordination of a national policy to 
prevent money laundering. 
  3. The prompt issuance of legal documents to implement the 
guidelines of the Vienna Convention and the FATF with regard to 
the banks obligation to: 
  3.1. register all international and local transactions in 
a logbook subject to revision by the Banking Commission; 
  3.2. rigorously investigate the origin and destination of 
intricate and unusual transactions; 
  3.3. report to the authorities suspicious transactions, 
safeguarding civil obligations concerning confidentiality; 
  3.4. implement in banks procedures and policies to 
prevent money laundering, training programs that impart to 
employees a thorough knowledge of internal auditing procedures, 
and programs to guarantee the fulfillment of these procedures; 
this duty would fall under the auspices of a high-ranking 
officer specifically designated to carry out these tasks; 
  3.5. register stock market transactions or securities 
deals that are unusual or suspicious in nature, subjecting them 
to revision by the Banking Commission. 
  4. The inclusion within the authority of the Banking 
Commission additional powers to prevent money laundering; the 
power to review the flow of funds from casinos, exchange houses, 
and money transfer agencies; and the power to enforce the 
obligation of these institutions to report such cashflows to the 
National Banking Commission. 
  5. The creation, as soon as possible, of an official data 
bank under the Banking Commission's control and administration 
to secure, compare, and analyze the information outlined in 
Cabinet Decree 41 of 13 February 1990 and Cabinet Decree 10 of 9 
March 1994. This includes any other information--to be 
furnished upon request--regarding cash transactions, negotiable 
documents, securities, or transfers made through electronic or 
magnetic media. 
  6. An agreement on the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty [MLAT] 
to strengthen and broaden Panama's participation in the struggle 
against money laundering and the speedy ratification of the MLAT 
by the relevant institutions. 
  7. The adoption of a doctrine or a group of principles that 
oppose money laundering and emphasize systematic, continuous, 
and dynamic preventative action instead of focusing on how best 
to deal with crimes already committed. In addition, such a 
doctrine should protect our irreplaceable service economy and 
Panama's good name and image. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  In conclusion, the Banking Association wants to acknowledge 
that in Panama, as well as in many other friendly nations, the 
problem of money laundering is a reality. In addition, it wants 
to signal that the problem of money laundering is constantly 
changing and remains extremely dynamic in terms of criminal 
creativity and resources available to criminals who constantly 
modify and invent new money laundering techniques, thereby 
making current preventive actions ineffective. The struggle 
against money laundering requires constant surveillance, quick 
action, and close international coordination and cooperation to 
remain in step with the criminals and to avoid losing the 
battle. Above all else, the struggle requires knowledge, 
commitment, and the willingness of the state and all national 
sectors to achieve final victory.

<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega; from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  (Text] The PTJ [Judicial Technical Police] warehouse has no 
more room to store drugs, and a special warehouse vault with an 
incinerator needs to be built. PTJ Director Jaime Abad visited 
the Presidency today concerning this matter. He met with 
Presidency Minister Ivonne Young to request a special allocation 
of 75,000 balboas to build the vault to store and destroy the 
drug. Abad said a large amount of drugs, confiscated in 
different operations, is being stored. [Begin recording] 
  Abad: We are close to three tons of cocaine, and 
we are also storing marijuana. 
  Ortega: Is there no way of getting rid of it? 
  Abad: There is no way; there is no way. We have 
no room for it. There is, honestly, no room for it in the PTJ 
warehouse, which I insist is a warehouse and not a vault with 
extractors of contaminating gases. Our personnel are breathing 
those gases, contaminating themselves. They are showing 
allergic symptoms. This is not the most scientific method. As 
you may recall from the latest burnings, our detectives have to 
spread the substances with their hands when we incinerate drugs. 
We lack gloves and gas masks. Everything is done in a very 
rudimentary and totally archaic manner. [end recording] 
  Compounding the matter, the incinerations done in the open 
air cause major ecological damage, incinerations the PTJ 
director described as a clear emergency. He added friendly 
countries such as Germany and the United States have been asked 
for assistance. Because there has been no response, an 
allocation for $75,000 balboas to build the vault to store and 
destroy the drugs will have to come from state funds. The 
legislative assembly and the executive branch will have the 
final word.

  [Text] Lima 24 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori today termed positive U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
proposal to Congress that U.S. support to Peru for the detection 
of drug trafficking from the air be reestablished. 
  Fujimori said, however, that "with or without support" Peru 
is carrying out a firm and constant struggle against drug 
trafficking. 
  He recalled that the contribution made by the U.S. AWACS and 
Orion airplanes with modern equipment for detecting airplanes 
had been very effective when they were cooperating with the 
Peruvian Air Force, until May when the U.S. Government decided 
to withdraw that support. 
  In a news conference Fujimori said that with that help "our 
airplanes were able to persecute and shoot down" the airplanes 
of Colombian drug traffickers entering the Peruvian jungle 
region to pick up the basic cocaine paste gathered by drug 
traffickers. 
  Fujimori added that the U.S. radar installed in the jungle 
region, which was also deactivated, was not effective as it is 
obsolete equipment used during World War II. 
  He said that the reestablishment of the aid for detecting 
the 
airplanes of drug traffickers would be a positive step. 
  He reiterated that the struggle against drug trafficking is 
an international problem, which is the responsibility of drug 
producing and consuming countries.

  [Text] Lima, 21 Jun (EFE) -- A military source reported 
today that, following the suspension in May of U.S. logistic 
support to combat the transportation of cocaine by air, 
trafficking in Peru has regained what it lost over the past 
couple of years. 
  The source added that drug mafias have increased their 
flights. He said they resumed operating in the Huallaga Valley 
from where they were forced to withdraw in 1993 in view of 
effective repressive operations by the Peruvian Air Force (FAP), 
which operated with the support of U.S. radar installations. 
  Opposition Legislator Julio Castro Gomez has stated that if 
the current level of trafficking flights is maintained, it will 
reach 10,000 by the end of the year. 
  With each flight, the Colombian drug "cartels" transport 
guns 
and money to Peru in exchange for cocaine paste which is later 
transformed into cocaine hydrochloride in Colombian laboratories. 
  Castro Gomez stated that according to official sources, the 
Colombian planes transport between 1,300 to 1,500 metric tons of 
cocaine paste per year, and leave in Peru somewhere between $1.5 
and $2 billion. 
  Trafficking has been back to normal since May when the U.S. 
Government closed down the only fixed radar it operated in Peru. 
It also decided to suspend flights of its AWACS E-3 and Orion 
P-3 planes, equipped with modern flight detection equipment. 
  The U.S. withdrawal, which took Peruvian officials by 
surprise, compelled the Peruvian Government to issue a formal 
protest. They reasserted, however, their firm political 
willingness to continue the antidrug struggle with their own 
resources. 
  Achieving this goal is, however, very difficult because Peru 
lacks the indispensable economic and material means to stop the 
shipments. 
  A high-ranking FAP official has stated that the U.S. 
decision 
"has left us virtually blind. We are frustrated because drug 
traffickers are flying right under our noses and we are unable 
to do anything about it." 
  The same source noted that the only means available to the 
FAP to combat the drug cargoes are four battered T-27 planes, 
two helicopters, and eventually, two more A-37 planes. 
  By comparison, the traffickers are equipped with modern 
planes that can easily dodge FAP planes and make night flights 
with special equipment. 
  The military source stated: "A T-37 flies at 200 knots and 
at 
26,000 feet, while drug mafia planes reach 300 knots and 30,000 
feet." 
  A U.S. technical mission arrived last week in Peru to 
explain 
the reasons for withdrawing its logistic air support. The 
result of the negotiations have been kept strictly secret. 
  The Peruvian press reported, nevertheless, that U.S. support 
was suspended for fear of legal complications for the United 
States in the event of a downing of a civilian plane "by 
mistake." 
  This comes following a recent experience in which a U.S. 
warplane mistakenly shot down two U.S. helicopters in Iraq. 
  The FAP spokesperson stated that U.S. Government's concern 
does not apply in Peru's case because experience has shown that 
the FAP complies with international regulations for the 
interception of planes. 
  He said: "When we intercept a plane we comply with the steps 
of verification, identification, and communication. Only then, 
and if it refuses to comply with orders, do we fire at non-vital 
parts of the plane and, as a last resort, shoot it down." 
  The Peruvian press has reported that it seems the United 
States wants to establish "specific legal guidelines" under 
which Peru will assume full responsibility if a civilian plane 
is mistakenly downed. 
  Some trafficking experts have stated, however, that 
Washington's fears do not justify withdrawing U.S. air logistics 
support from Peru. They added that the U.S. decision "causes 
doubts about its political willingness to combat the issue."

  [Text] Defunct U.S. radar installations have permitted 
Colombian and Peruvian drug traffickers to once again collect 
drugs in the Upper Huallaga valley, from where they "moved" some 
years ago when the FAP [Peruvian Air Force] began operations 
there. 
  Proof of this is a seizure by Dinandro [Antidrug Division] 
of 
537 kg of cocaine base, weapons, and communications equipment on 
5 June in Biabo district, Bellavista province, San Martin 
department. 
  Biabo, which is on the left bank of the Huallaga River, six 
km from Bellavista, had been free of traffickers. 
  The traffickers are said to have returned to the area. An 
individual known as "Lucho Tulon" might be one of the big shots. 
  The drugs, weapons, and communications equipment were buried 
in three "cellars"--a type of silo--some 500 meters from a house 
that had been raided. 
  This is one of the most important events, following the 
seizure of 3,500 kg of cocaine base in Boca Manu, El Diamante, 
Madre de Dios, and in Inapari. 
  Actions by the Army and the Antidrug Division (Dinandro) of 
the PNP [Peruvian National Police] in coca producing areas in 
Apurimac, Ayacucho, Pasco, and Madre de Dios has helped to drive 
traffickers to Upper Huallaga. 
  As is known, when FAP Tucano planes began operations in 
1992, 
the interception of Colombian traffickers' planes was 
intensified. 
  Some 200 small planes and civil planes are known to have 
been 
intercepted in coca growing areas since the start of FAP 
operations. 
  FAP Tucano planes operated from illegal airstrips in the 
jungle, helped by the U.S. radar installations in Yurimaguas, 
and the Orion and AWACS planes. 
  As of May, however, the United States suspended radar 
operations leaving FAP Tucano planes without classified 
information to help intercept traffickers' planes. 
  The traffickers took advantage of this and have resumed 
their 
illegal work in the Huallaga region.

  [Excerpt] The Constituent Congress plenum on 15 June 
insisted on its original draft bill that punishes those involved 
in poppy growing with up to 15 years of imprisonment, thus 
minimizing the executive branch proposal for reduced punishment 
for those who own up to one kilogram of poppy seeds. 
  The bill states that those who engage in growing, promoting, 
helping, or financing garden poppy will be punished with 
imprisonment terms no shorter than eight years and no longer 
than 15 years. It adds that if someone is captured with a 
maximum of 100 poppy plants, he will be sentenced to prison for 
no less than two years and no more than eight years. 
  In an effort to justify the bill, Congressman Carlos Ferrero 
Costa (C 90-NM) [Change 90-New Majority] said these details are 
necessary because "one kilogram of garden poppy seeds can 
produce up to 38 kg of poppy." 
  The draft bill adds that those people who are facing trial 
or 
already have been sentenced for this crime will not be granted 
any freedom on bail, parole, probation, redemption of the 
sentence by work or education, remission of the sentence, or 
pardon. 
  Since Congress insisted on its original proposal, the draft 
bill must be promulgated by the Congress president to be 
implemented. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Lima, 24 Jun (EFE) -- A law establishing prison 
sentences of eight to 15 years for people who grow 
heroin-producing poppies went into effect in Peru today. 
  The law was approved by Congress on 22 June. It confirms the 
sentences included in the original bill. 
  The Peruvian penal code now includes the "crime of growing, 
promoting, assisting, or financing" the planting of poppy 
plantations used for making opium or heroin. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with General Jose Nadal Payva, the Peruvian Air </F>
Force, FAP, commander, by unidentified reporter; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [EXPRESO] Gen. Nadal, could you tell us how the FAP 
participates in drug enforcement actions? 
  Nadal: The FAP has been carrying out joint 
operations with the PNP [Peruvian National Police] since 1985, 
seeking to neutralize drug trafficking activities in Peru. 
  In 1981 we verified that traffickers and terrorists had 
formed an alliance. The FAP then began to operate from the 
Santa Lucia Base because illegal activities like that threaten 
national security. 
  Through Decree Law No. 25426 of 10 April 1991, and Decree 
Law 
No. 042-DE/FAP of 16 June 1992, the FAP was legally empowered to 
control all landing strips in Huallaga and other places where 
coca is grown. The FAP is thus responsible for destroying 
clandestine landing strips and for downing planes intercepted in 
Peruvian air space that refuse to obey orders to land. 
  To carry out its mission, the FAP uses its A-37, T-27, Y-12, 
and T-41 planes as well as gunships that can operate day and 
night. 
  EXPRESO: What are the results of these operations? 
  Nadal: Since 1991 the FAP has spotted, 
intercepted, captured and/or destroyed about 200 Peruvian and 
foreign aircraft that have violated the Civil Aviation Law 
and/or engaged in trafficking. More than $1.2 billion resulting 
from drug trafficking and 3.6 tonnes of cocaine paste have also 
been seized. 
  The FAP, the Peruvian Army, and the PNP have destroyed 
clandestine landing strips and cocaine paste laboratories in 
various areas including Caballococha and Puerto Maldonado. It 
should also be mentioned that more than 7,000 flight hours have 
been invested in enforcement operations. Considering our 
limitations, the balance of our participation is encouraging and 
positive, not just because of our achievements but also because 
of the high morale of our troops. 
  EXPRESO: What contribution is the FAP making to 
the current pacification process regarding the civic actions and 
social aide in general? 
  Nadal: The FAP has stepped up its participation, 
as far as civic actions and social aide is concerned, through 
the following activities: Granting free medical attention in 
clinical medicine, odontology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, 
pediatrics, gynecology, urology, cardiology, traumatology, 
pneumology, and various types of surgery, as well as medical 
evacuations, distribution of medicines, massive vaccination, and 
providing air transportation for civil personnel in emergency 
cases in outlying towns where the FAP has personnel stationed. 
  During this year the FAP has performed some 710 flight hours 
transporting to and from the interior approximately 15,500 
people and 100,000 kg of foodstuffs, clothing, equipment, and 
machinery necessary for the national pacification process in 
which the national government is engaged. 
  Moreover, we have organized and implemented youth clubs 
called "Los Aguiluchos" [Little Eagles] that involve 
approximately 1,500 children between 6 and 12 years of age who 
receive clothing, civilian-patriotic teachings, talks on the 
prevention of drug addiction and infectious diseases, remedial 
courses, sports, handicraft, and recreation. 
  This social assistance also reaches the parents with 
periodic 
conferences on subjects like "Responsible Parenthood" and "Child 
Psychology." 
  The FAP also facilitates communication free of charge for 
local inhabitants at certain hours of the day. 
  EXPRESO: You headed the Peruvian delegation to the 
latest International Air Fair in Chile. How does our FAP 
compared with the technological and scientific developments 
displayed there? 
  Nadal: The fair was visited by more than 900,000 
spectators where 31 countries exhibited their goods. The FAP 
used the opportunity to create a landmark in its relationship 
with the sister Latin American Air Forces by reasserting the 
well-known professional level of its personnel through a 
presentation, which was described as excellent both from the 
operative as well as technical viewpoint, operating M2000 
aircraft and state of the art technology. 
  The FAP Aircraft Maintenance Service (Seman) has proven that 
it is able to deal with high technology and that it provides FAP 
planes with excellent service. This can also be applied to 
other types of Peruvian or foreign aircraft.

  [Text] Action by alert employees at the Carib 
Brewery in Champs Fleurs on Friday assisted the Customs 
Department in making its largest marijuana haul for the year, 
and has opened up leads to a possible transhipment operation 
involving containers ferried between Miami and Jamaica. 
  The illicit cargo, more than 2,000 pounds of compressed 
marijuana with a street value of more than $TT6 million, was 
discovered when Carib employees involved in a loading operation 
came up against a camouflaged fibre-glass wall and secret 
compartment inside a 40-foot steel container. 
  The container, which came into Trinidad a week ago 
originally 
with goods from Jamaica for a Piarco entrepreneur, was one of 
several sent to the Carib plant from the Port-of-Spain docks by 
shipping agents to be loaded with products for Kingston. 
  Together with their management, the employees alerted the 
Customs officer who is always at their plant overseeing the 
export loading operations, and found the drugs when they pried 
the wall open. 
  The marijuana was nearly wrapped in some 250 plastic bags 
stacked inside a two-foot deep compartment behind the 
fibre-glass wall, which was painted and corrugated to make it 
appear identical to the regular steel wall at the back of the 
container. 
  They also found a Jamaica newspaper dated April 3 inside of 
the compartment. 
  Carib management was loud in their praise for the work and 
co-operation of the Customs officials, as well as the employees 
who made the discovery. 
  They had become suspicious when the container was filled 
although they had not yet hand-packed the number of cases that 
each such container is supposed to hold. 
  According to reports, one of the employees crawled along the 
two-foot space between the cases and the roof of the already 
filled 44-foot container to examine what the problem might be, 
and on tapping the rear wall found to his surprise that it was 
not steel but corrugated fibre glass. 
  The cases were then offloaded and the bags of marijuana 
found 
behind the fibre-glass wall. Preliminary investigations have 
revealed that the particular container was loaded in Jamaica and 
arrived in the country on April 23 from Miami with a cargo of 
goods consigned to the Piarco entrepreneur. 
  The goods were cleared on April 28 before the container was 
assigned to Carib by the shipping agents the following day. But 
the marijuana was not discovered until the loading operations at 
the brewery late Friday afternoon within an hour of the arrival 
of the container on the Carib compounds. 
  A team of Customs Preventive officers went to the plant to 
view the booty about three hours after it was discovered. They 
weighed it on the spot, packed it in two vans and despatched it 
to their warehouse in Port-of-Spain. 
<H5>  Full Support </H5>
  A Customs spokesman said their investigations were 
continuing 
along "certain positive directions." He was not prepared to 
reveal any more, but the Narcotics Branch of the Police Service 
has also been brought into the picture. 
  In pursuit of information regarding the origin and 
destination of the illegal cargo, local authorities have 
contacted international investigative agencies, and the local 
Customs Department was receiving the fullest co-operation of 
their counterparts at U.S. Customs. 
  However, local shipping officials were saying yesterday it 
is 
unlikely that any marijuana trafficking occurred in any 
direction between Jamaica and Trinidad because police believe 
both countries produce the drug in vast amounts. 
  The shippers believe, therefore, that the marijuana was 
transported originally from Jamaica to Miami where it missed its 
pick-up because of some foul-up. The shipment then became loose 
cargo until its discovery at Carib, which ships about 50 
containers a week, mostly to Jamaica. 
<H5>  Tracing the Drug to Trinidad </H5>
  Container SCZU 3031795 arrived at the Port-of-Spain docks on 
April 23 on the vessel MV-Cari Sky. 
  The voyage originated in Miami, but that particular 
container 
was loaded at Kingston, Jamaica, and consigned to a Piarco 
entrepreneur. 
  The Piarco entrepreneur took delivery of the sealed 
container 
on April 28, having a transport contractor move it out of the 
Port-of-Spain docks. 
  The container was returned to the port the following 
morning, 
April 29, before 8 o'clock, apparently empty. 
  Later that morning, the container was delivered to another 
transport contractor and arrived at the Carib brewery at 1.12 pm. 
  The container was backed up to the loading dock for 
immediate 
packing of a cargo of Guiness destined for Jamaica. 
  By 2.30 pm, Carib loaders found that the container could not 
take the expected 1,600 cases. Their investigations revealed the 
false wall in the container and the Customs officer on the spot 
was summoned. They pried the wall open and found the marijuana 
stacked in a two-foot deep compartment, packed in plastic bags.

  [Text] Portugal and Venezuela have broadened even more 
their bilateral ties with the signing of three agreements that 
will be used as a frame of reference for future negotiations 
between the two countries. 
  At the meeting held at the Yellow House, Portuguese Prime 
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva and Venezuelan President Rafael 
Caldera signed three agreements on reciprocal investment 
promotion and protection; cooperation; and prevention, control, 
supervision, and suppression of illegal consumption and 
trafficking of drugs and psychotropic substances. 
  The Portuguese prime minister explained Portugal chose to 
broaden ties with Venezuela because Portugal believes Venezuela 
is one of the Latin American countries with the largest 
credibility.

  [Text] Beijing, June 22 (CNS) -- The Minister of Public 
Security, Mr. Tao Siju, said today that resolute measures would 
be continuously taken in China's anti-drug trafficking work this 
year and in the coming years to prevent drugs from flowing into 
China. 
  Speaking at a meeting held by the state anti-drug 
trafficking 
committee, Mr. Tao said despite of notable achievements made in 
the country's anti-drug trafficking campaign since last year, 
situation of drug-related crimes remained serious due to effects 
of the worldwide drug-related crimes. The anti-drug trafficking 
campaign was arduous with drug trafficking activities rampant in 
the frontier area of the southwest China and existence of 
illegal planting of opium poppies. Therefore, the campaign 
should not slack off. 
  Mr. Tao said top priority would be given to the frontier 
area 
of the southwest China such as Yunnan Province and Guangxi 
Province in terms of crackdown of border drug trafficking. 
These two provinces should intensify their anti-drug 
trafficking campaigns in order to prevent drugs made outside 
China from passing through the territory of China.

  [Text] China is to intensify its war against drug abuse 
and illicit trafficking, hoping to reduce drug-related climes to 
the lowest possible level a top anti-drugs official said 
yesterday in Beijing. 
  Close cooperation among police and customs in all provinces 
and with the international community will be needed to fight the 
drug war, the official warned. 
  Zhuo Feng, deputy secretary general of the National 
Narcotics 
Control Commission, made these remarks just before the 
International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking 
which falls on Sunday. 
  All provinces and cities will stage public awareness 
activities to alert people about the dangers of drugs. 
  In the first quarter of this year, more than 4,910 
narcotics-related cases were solved and 6,624 suspects were 
detained. This marked a 64.6 percent and 40 percent increase 
over the same period last year. 
  Seizures included 1.007 kilograms of heroin and 476 
kilograms 
of opium, Zhuo said. 
  Last year, a total of 26,191 drug cases were cracked and 
40,834 suspects were detained. 
  During that year police and customs seized 4,459 kilograms 
of 
heroin, 3,354 kilograms of opium and 90 tons of chemicals which 
could be made into narcotics. 
  Among the detained, 6,137 were sentenced. Some 1,410 
received death sentence or terms of life imprisonment. 
  China's anti-drug campaign has focused on the Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province, both bordering the 
notorious "Golden Triangle" in Myanmar [Burma], Thailand and 
Laos. 
  The border provinces accounted for about 80 per cent of the 
heroin and 70 percent of the opium seized in the country in the 
first three months this year, Zhuo said. 
  Estimates of the number of drug addicts in the country stand 
at 250,000. Over 400 drug rehabilitation centres have been 
established to help the addicts quit their criminal vice. 
  Last year, about 50,000 gave up their addiction after 
treatment in the centres, he said. 
  He also revealed that 982 HIV positive cases among the 1,106 
found in the mainland were caused by drugs addiction and 
injection. 
  HIV is a major virus which can lead to AIDS. 
  Zhuo said that his commission and the Ministry of Public 
Security have drafted a set of rules to force drug addicts to 
quit. The rules have been submitted to the State Council and 
are expected to be approved and implemented later this year. 
  The country has been actively cooperating with international 
organizations on narcotics control. Personnel training and 
information exchanges on drug trafficking cases have been 
carried out with some countries. 
  The narcotics control programme of China, Myanmar and the UN 
is being carried out smoothly and China's cooperation with 
Thailand and Laos in this field has also been strengthened.

  [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- China cracked more than 
4,900 narcotics-related criminal cases in the first quarter this 
year, seizing some 1,000 kilograms of heroin and 476 kilograms 
of opium. 
  This was revealed by Bai Jingfu, vice-minister of public 
security, here today at a working conference of the National 
Commission of Narcotics Control (NCNC). 
  "Narcotics-related crimes, especially transnational drug 
smuggling, were effectively curbed in the country as police and 
customs officers joined efforts to combat them," Bai told the 
conference. 
  China's anti-drug campaign has been centered on the Guangxi 
Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province, both bordering the 
"Golden Triangle" in Myanmar [Burma] which are ravaged the most 
by deadly crimes as smugglers choose to transport narcotics 
through these areas to other parts of the world. 
  The border provinces accounted for 82 percent of the heroin 
and 70 percent of the opium seized in the country in the first 
three months this year, said the vice-minister, who is also 
deputy director of the NCNC. 
  Bai said China's cooperation with the international 
community 
in its fight against drug crimes has been "effective." 
  The narcotics control program of China, Myanmar and the UN 
is 
"being carried out smoothly," he said, adding that China's 
cooperation with Thailand and Laos in this field has also been 
strengthened. 
  Meanwhile, Bai noted that China has also made remarkable 
achievements in drug rehabilitation programs. 
  "The rising trend of new addicts has been slowed and the 
country has begun to see an annual decrease in the new addict 
population," he said. 
  Some 50,000 of the country's drug addicts received training 
courses to quit drugs in 1993, he said. 
  Minister of Public Security and NCNC Director Tao Siju also 
told the conference that China will continue its cooperation 
with the international community, especially bordering 
countries, in combating drug-related crime. 
  "With rampant international narcotics crimes, China still 
faces a harsh challenge from traffickers and it will continue to 
intensify the crackdown on these crimes with cooperation from 
its customs, and organizations in other countries and regions, 
so as to reduce the impact of drug trafficking to the minimum," 
Tao said.

  [Text] Nanning, June 18 (CNS) -- The Director of the 
Public Security Bureau of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 
Mr. Lin Chaoqun, said here that remarkable achievement had been 
made in the Region's campaign against drug and gun trafficking. 
  Mr. Lin said during the period from June of last year to May 
this year, the Region had uncovered 5008 drug cases, more than 
500 of them being big cases. Over 700-kilogram opium, 
120-kilogram heroin, 16-kilogram caffeine and RMB [renminbi] 2.4 
million gained from drug trafficking had been seized. Some 189 
cases of gun trafficking had been also uncovered with 346 guns, 
8200 rounds of ammunition as well as over 360 grenades, 
flashlights and mines seized. 
  Special efforts must be made in areas teeming with such 
illegal activities. The areas, according to Guangxi, include 
frontier area connecting the Region with Vietnam, the juncture 
between the Region and Yunnan Province, Guizhou City and 
Guangdong Province. Hubs of communications in the Region such 
as Nanning City, Liuzhou City and Wuzhou City as well as the 
important communication lines and districts along these lines. 
  It was reported that drug taking situation in the Region had 
been rampant with drug market there expanding. According to the 
authoritative statistics, drug addicts in the Region have 
reached nearly 40,000 in number covering 6 cities, 8 prefectures 
and 79 counties there. A special campaign against drug 
underground market has been staged in Nanning, Liuzhou, Wuzhou 
and Beihai at present to curb drug addiction. In Frontier 
areas, more than 250,000 opium poppies have been rooted out. 
  Serious punishment had been imposed on criminals engaging in 
drug and gun trafficking. From June of last year till May this 
year, among 326 criminals arrested, 209 of them had been 
sentenced to different terms of imprisonment with 16 of them 
sentenced to death, 11 sentenced to suspended death and 21 to 
life imprisonment. On June 26 this year, the international day 
for banning drugs, another batch of criminals will be put to 
death in the region. 
  Mr. Lin said drug trafficking cases in the Region had been 
increasing. In the former five months this year, such cases had 
increased by 60 percent than the same period of last year and 
heroin seized doubled that in the same period of last year. 
Therefore it would be still an arduous task for the Region to 
handle such problems.

<H5>  Authorities Seize Amphetamines in Bangkok, Nakhon Ratchasima </H5>
  The Narcotics Suppression Bureau and Border Patrol Police on 
23 June jointly announced two separate seizures of amphetamines 
in Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima. In Bangkok, Border Patrol 
Police from Region 1 and the Central Narcotics Bureau jointly 
charged five suspects with possession and sale of amphetamines 
above the legal amount. The five--Sakda Sukying, 33; Prasoet 
Pangdi, 30; Somsak Pangdi, 32; Ari Sawatdirot, 48; and Wanthakan 
Kamrian, 34--allegedly met in the car park of a department store 
in Bangkok's Bang Khunthian District to sell the drugs. Ari and 
Wanthakan were said to have handed a paper bag containing money 
for the amphetamines to the other three suspects, who were the 
suppliers. Police seized 40,000 amphetamine tablets. In Nakhon 
Ratchasima, two suspects whose names were not given were held 
with 30,000 amphetamine tablets in Sikhiu District. (Bangkok

<H5>  Alleged Yakuza Member Arrested With Heroin at Bangkok Airport </H5>
  Japanese national Abe Shogo, 47--accused of being a member 
of 
the underworld Yakuza--was arrested at Bangkok's Don Muang 
Airport on 23 June in possession of 7.5 kg of heroin. Narcotics 
Control Board officials found the heroin hidden in four 
pearl-studded wooden picture frames allegedly belonging to the 
man as he was about to board a Northwest Airlines flight to Los 
Angeles. Although this is not the first time a Japanese has 
been detained in Thailand for heroin trafficking, arrests on 
similar charges have been seldom. The arrest was made with the 
acknowledgment of the Japanese Embassy in Bangkok. Shogo has 
been a member of the organized crime gang for 10 years. Shogo 
denied the charges, claiming he was dining with a Thai woman, 
named only as Mali, at a restaurant when another Thai woman 
asked him to take the four picture frames to an unidentified 
person in Los Angeles. (Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 24 Jun

  [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- The Investigation Bureau 
announced Monday [20 June] that an international 
drug-trafficking ring involving both Japanese and Taiwanese was 
cracked Sunday, with more than 150 kilograms of amphetamines 
being seized. 
  Five Japanese, including an underground gang member and four 
fishing boat crewmembers, were arrested Sunday while trying to 
smuggle the 151 kilograms of high-grade amphetamines through 
Kagoshima port in Kyushu, Japan. Simultaneously, four 
Taiwanese, including two traffickers and two dealers, were 
apprehended in Taiwan, Wang Hua-fu, a spokesman for the bureau's 
Taipei headquarters, said. 
  Wang said bureau officials had teamed with Japanese police 
for three months in trying to crack the drug ring, which bought 
amphetamines in Mainland China and then smuggled the shipments 
to Japan via Taiwanese and Japanese fishing boats. According to 
Wang, the ring, which was supported by Japanese organized crime 
syndicates, had smuggled several metric tons of amphetamines 
from Mainland China to Japan over the last eight years. 
Amphetamines have become a popular drug among the middle and 
lower classes in Japan, and prices for it have been surpassing 
that of heroin. The amphetamines seized Sunday have a street 
value of US$55.55 million [words indistinct]. 
  This was the biggest anti-drug-smuggling operation mounted 
by 
Taiwan since a national anti-drug conference was held here 
earlier this month.

  [Text] Chiang Rai police yesterday seized a large cache of 
assault rifles and ammunition, and arrested a man who claimed 
the weapons were destined for drug warlord Khun Sa for use 
against Burmese government troops. 
  The 267 AK-47 rifles and ammunition were worth an estimated 
Bt[baht]3 million, police said. They had come from the 
Cambodian border area and were to be resold for profit. 
  Police said the arrested man Thanong Phrapphradon, 29, of Sa 
Kaeo province, said that the weapons belong to Somphong Songsuk, 
23, of the same province. 
  Thanong was travelling in a six-wheel truck with another man 
when police at a checkpoint in Chiang Rai's Mae Chan district 
signalled them to stop. 
  The vehicle allegedly drove through the barricade. Police 
chased the vehicle, which they later found abandoned. The two 
men were running away. Thanong was arrested but his comrade is 
still at large. 
  The weapons were found in the back of the truck hidden under 
a pile of pumpkins.

  [Excerpts] The bank of Thailand has announced strong 
support for legislation to curb money laundering, saying a 
money-laundering law will boost Thailand's image and raise the 
standard of the Thai financial system. 
  Dr Bandid Nijthavorn, the central bank's deputy director of 
the Research Department, said if Thailand wants to develop 
further as a financial centre and win recognition from the 
international community, it must introduce legislation, similar 
to that in Hong Kong or Singapore, to make money laundering 
unlawful. 
  Bandid's remark, made yesterday at the Journalists 
Association of Thailand, was the first time that the central 
bank came out unequivocally in support of a money-laundering law. 
  The drug scandal surrounding MP Thanong Siriprechapong, who 
was forced to resign, dealt a blow to the Thai Parliament and 
Thailand was seen as a haven for money laundering. 
  The Chuan administration has come under domestic and 
international pressure to introduce money-laundering 
legislation. But Bandid said the legislation should not only 
seek to curb illegal drug activities but also cover other 
criminal acts and political corruption. [passage omitted] 
  Bandid said that old laws seeking to curb money laundering 
are not broad enough to cover economic crimes, so it is 
necessary to introduce a brand new money-laundering law, which 
should seek to: 
  1. Penalize all individuals associated with money-laundering 
activities as a criminal offence; 
  2. Require financial institutions to report to the 
authorities unusual transactions; 
  3. Lay down the same system for all financial institutions 
to 
file reports of suspicious transactions. 
  Bandid cautioned that the legislation should not create 
unwarranted burdens on the financial institutions.

  [Text] Bangkok -- The Money Laundering Law Drafting 
Committee revealed the increase in money laundering through the 
stock market. Money launderers are reported to have purchased 
stocks to take over businesses. Such a practice is prevalent in 
foreign countries and is now spreading in the Thai stock market. 
Preventive measures are being worked out to authorize the 
information management committee to examine financial records of 
possible launderers and keep track of stock transactions. 
  Wiraphong Bunyophat, director of the Economic Crime 
Information Center and a member of the Money Laundering Law 
Drafting Committee, disclosed that a seminar on financial 
institutes' perception of money laundering law will be held at 
the Faculty of Law of Chulalongkon University on 29 June. 
  The seminar will hear views and comments on the legislation 
from various financial institutes such as the Securities 
Exchange of Thailand, Office of Securities Exchange Commission, 
commercial banks, and central bank. 
  At the initial stage, the money laundering law will focus 
only on the money earned from narcotic trafficking to ensure its 
quick passage. It will take time if the law will be designed to 
deal with incomes from other illicit activities. In most cases, 
money launderers will deposit their money in different banks 
under the names of different persons which makes it difficult 
for official examination. 
  The committee, therefore, proposed the change in the 
regulations governing opening of bank accounts so that 
depositors are required to show their citizen identification 
cards and evidence to prove that the money is theirs. 
Meanwhile, most commercial banks are very cooperative with 
authorities in checking deposit accounts. However, a specific 
law is needed to facilitate the operation. 
  It is rather difficult to launder dirty money through the 
national bank because the latter has an effective examination 
system. 
  The stock market is the second place after commercial banks 
for money laundering. More launderers are believed to turn to 
the stock market to launder their money. As more companies 
become public companies, money launderers can buy as much stock 
as they want. In some cases, they even take over businesses. 
  Wiraphong noted: "Such a practice is prevalent in foreign 
countries, where dirty money is used to buy public companies in 
the stock market. This is now taking place on the Thai stock 
market, so preventive measures must be worked out." 
  Commenting on the preventive measures, Wiraphong said that 
the procedure now being used by commercial banks might be 
applicable. For instance, stock buyers and sellers are required 
to open accounts, and the committee is authorized to check their 
financial status at various financial institutes. No one is 
allowed to open an account on behalf of others. 
  In this regard, Pricha Suwannathat is working on the clause 
on the prevention of money laundering through financial 
institutes. 
  So far, the money laundering through stock buying and 
selling 
is being widely practiced in the northern part of Thailand. 
Money earned from narcotics trafficking is used to buy stocks 
at trading floors in the northern provinces. There is no law 
permitting the authorities to examine the source of the money.

  [Excerpts] It is not known for certain, despite official 
statistics, how many drug addicts there are in Thailand. 
  However, while Thailand has been actively involved in the 
international effort to suppress the drug trade and eradicate 
the demand for narcotics, the number of addicts in the southern 
provinces has steadily increased. 
  In the South drug addicts are plentiful in villages, prisons 
and seafaring communities. 
  A great variety of narcotics are used heavily in nearly all 
of the villages in the 14 southern provinces. The five 
provinces with a predominant Muslim population--Songkhla, 
Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and Satun--are reputed to be 
drug-infested areas. 
  "Drugs traffickers are digging gold in the South. Their 
annual combined earnings are well over a billion baht," an 
official at the Southern Narcotics Prevention and Suppression 
Centre (NPSC) asserted. 
  How do drugs find their way to the South without being 
intercepted by the watchful drug suppression units? 
  The drug route stretches from the northernmost Thai 
territory 
bordering Burma, a major source of narcotics, to the southern 
provinces adjacent to Malaysia. 
  To avoid the anti-narcotics squads, the traffickers have to 
zig-zag their ways through the Central plains. 
  The transactions for both local consumption and shipment to 
overseas markets are done at "strategic locations" in the South. 
  According to the NPSC official, the highly-priced 
narcotics--mainly raw opium and high-grade heroin--get to the 
South by land and sea. 
  The most widely used route is the Petchkasem Highway. The 
traffickers' first stop is generally somewhere in Lang Suan 
Dlstrict, Chumphon. Then, to make it more difficult for the 
authorities to track their movements, the traffickers split into 
two groups--one heads for the southernmost provinces; the other 
takes a detour along the Andaman Sea. 
  According to the official, the narcotics trade thrives in 
Surat Thani, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Songkhla, Hat Yai, Sadao, 
Satun and Sungai Kolok. A substantial amount of the illicit 
drugs are sold locally and shipped to overseas markets via 
Malaysia. 
  Surat Thani is one of the major narcotics shipment centres 
due to the large demand for them in nearby Koh Samui and Koh Pha 
Ngan, which draw a lot of foreign tourists throughout the year. 
  And Hat Yai, which has the highest percentage of drug 
addicts 
in the South, has an inexhaustible demand for the narcotics. 
  Various kinds of illicit drugs are sold and distributed to 
the ready Sadao and Sungai Kolok markets in Songkhla and 
Narathiwat provinces. 
  There is also a lucrative narcotics trade in Satun where 
local traffic ends and shipments to overseas markets begin. 
Satun--with over ten ports including the ones in Pak Bara, Hua 
Hin and Tu Tae Lum--is the region best-suited for narcotics 
shipments in the South. 
  Prior to the transactions, the illicit drugs can be kept 
hidden in the numerous islands in the Satun vicinity. The 
narcotics are then loaded on to awaiting vessels for shipments 
to Singapore and elsewhere. 
  Meanwhile, the second group of narcotics traffickers 
continue 
along the Andaman Sea until they get to a well-guarded location 
in Phuket. There, the illicit drugs are shipped to the United 
States and Europe. Well-equipped luxury yachts are used for 
transporting purposes. 
  "The narcotics transported to the South by sea are generally 
successful. When in danger of being intercepted and searched, 
the crew simply drops the insulated drug packages into the sea 
for later retrievals," said the NPSC official. 
  Young drug users in the 14 southern provinces are the prime 
target of the mushrooming narcotics trade. 
  "Drug use is prevalent among local youngsters in the two 
southern districts," said the NPSC official. 
  Five of the 14 southern provinces--Songkhla, Yala, Pattani, 
Satun and Narathiwat--are heavily infested with the illicit 
drugs. And of the 6,991 southern villages, 3,504 villages--over 
50 per cent--are infested with the illicit drugs like marijuana 
and heroin. 
  "In fact, there are heroin addicts in over 90 per cent of 
the 
southern villages and communities," and marijuana is grown in 
almost every village, according to the NPSC official. 
  Narathiwat is singled out as the most drug-infested 
province. 
According to official statistics, the province had 2,412 drug 
addicts in 1992, an increase of 43 per cent from the previous 
year. 
  Some 8,675 drug addicts, a negligible number compared to the 
total addicted population, underwent treatment and 
rehabilitation at the 18 Southern Drug Addicts Treatment Centres 
in 1992. 
  More than 70 per cent of Narathiwat's 400 villages are 
infested with drug addicts who are mostly youngsters and 
labourers. An unspecified number of drug addicts are found in 
soem 39 per cent of Pattani's 600 villages. And approximately 
44 per cent of Yala's 300 villages are reported to have drug 
addicts. 
  According to research done by Narathiwat Hospital, some 99 
per cent of heavy cigarette smokers have in time become addicted 
to marijuana and then heroin. Further, many heroin addicts are 
addicted to powerful sleeping pills, the hospital said. 
  The number of drug addicts has increased rapidly in 
narathiwat over the past few years because of the availability 
of narcotics in Muang District and in most of the outlying 
villages. 
  Sungai Kolok District is plagued with a drug addiction 
problem, including intravenous drug use popular among teenagers 
which accompanies the thriving prostitution business. Thus, the 
rise in AIDS cases because of the expanding prostitution 
business is of additional concern in a province already infested 
with drug addicts. 
  "Fifty-two per cent first sexual experiences for boys under 
18 are with prostitutes. Some 80 per cent of them do not use 
condoms. The two groups infected with the Aids virus are the 
prostitutes in Muang District and the Yaweh-speaking addicts who 
find Thai literature on the dangers of the fatal disease and 
ways to prevent it incomprehensible," said the hospital report. 
  Because of an insufficient budget and personnel, drug 
trafficking suppression has met with repeated failures. 
Further, the simplistic tactics of law enforcement is 
ill-suited to deal with the increasingly sophisticated narcotics 
trade. Thus, narcotics transactions and addictions have 
increased and multiplied over the years. 
  The narcotics trade in the 14 southern provinces is believed 
to be worth over a billion baht the past year, and an annual 
increase of ten per cent is projected. 
  There are allegedly ten large-scale narcotics traffickers 
and 
about 1,000 low-level dealers dominating the southern drug 
markets. 
  Law enforcement has always been a big problem. The suspects 
may be arrested only when caught red-handed. Smart traffickers 
now keep the narcotics away from their businesses and 
residences. Only after the deals are sealed are the whereabouts 
of the purchases revealed. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Although he is dubbed a "godfather MP" by the 
media, veteran politician Piya Angkinant insists he has never 
been involved in the drug trade. 
  "I deny one million per cent that my reputation was built 
through a trade in contraband goods, including illicit drugs. 
In my view, drugs are the worst thing. My generation never got 
involved with drugs," he said. 
  Former Chat Thai MP Piya, widely known as the "Phetchaburi 
Godfather," revealed for the first time that he received the 
pseudonym because he had acquaintances from all walks of life in 
the province. 
  "In Phetchaburi province, I've studied in almost every 
school. Friends who studied with me years ago have now become 
`big' in various government agencies." 
  "I still keep in touch with them. They help me every time I 
have a problem. At present, several of them are in the Army, 
the Police Department and in the judicial branch." [passage 
omitted] 
  He said he stopped employing bodyguards 10 years ago. 
  "At present, I go about with a driver only," he said. "I 
used to have enemies, but all of them have died." 
  He was drawn to politics, he said, because his family had 
been involved in politics for years. 
  Piya failed to win a seat in Phetchaburi last time round, 
but 
plans to run in Phetchaburi again in the next general election. 
  He said his son Chaiya would also compete in the next 
election. 
  "My son and I are canvassing for the next general election. 
I usually give out about Bt500-1,000 per charity. To date, 
I've spent hundreds of thousands of baht of my own money," he 
said. 
  Asked about his political ambitions, Piya said he was ready 
to become a Cabinet minister. In particular he would like to be 
Interior Minister. 
  He believed he could persuade influential figures in the 
country to stop their campaigns of violence. 
  Piya said he did not know if Chat Thai MP Thanong 
Siriprechapong, was guilty of the charge, laid in the US, of 
smuggling more than 45 tonnes of marijuana into the United 
States. 
  "Since I entered the Chat Thai Party, I have never heard 
such 
a story," he said. 
  However, Piya said Thanong should resign from the House and 
from Chat Thai. 
  He said it would be difficult to get the House to pass 
legislation against money laundering because some MPs may think 
they would be affected by the new laws. 
  Piya was a five-time MP for Phetchaburi province. He was 
first elected to serve in the House in 1975 and served as 
personal secretary to former Chat Thai leader Pramarn Adireksarn 
the same year. 
  In 1979, he was personal secretary to former prime minister 
Gen Kriangsak Chanamand who was also the then agriculture 
minister.

  [Text] The Counter Corruption Commission is drafting a bill 
to deal with the laundering of "dirty money" acquired from 
narcotics trafficking or other illegal activities, CCC 
secretary-general Prasit Damrongchai said yesterday. 
  Mr Prasit said the bill would be completed in two weeks and 
forwarded to the Cabinet for consideration. 
  He said the bill would empower the Bank of Thailand to 
examine the movements of money belonging to individuals 
suspected of involvement in the businesses or who are 
"unusually" rich. 
  The directors-general of the Police and Customs departments 
and the secretaries-general of the CCC and Office of Narcotics 
Control Board will be empowered to examine suspected "dirty 
money," he said. 
  All other officials will be barred form checking into the 
source of "dirty moeny" to protect the rights and freedoms of 
individuals. 
  Mr Prasit said it was impossible to fix the amount of money 
determined as unusually large and suspected of being acquired 
illegally other than to base it on the occupation of the 
individuals under suspicion. 
  For instance, a civil servant earning 30,000 baht a month 
yet 
with 500,000 baht in the bank would cause suspicion as to how 
the money was acquired. Like-wise, a businessman who operates a 
business worth about 1,000 million baht and has a revolving fund 
which doubles the amount of the operating fund would also 
warrant an examination to determine the source of the money. 
  He said the anti-money laundering law would greatly benefit 
the CCC's operations. If there is a complaint of corruption by 
an official or of an official said to be unusually rich, the CCC 
could ask for information about the official's financial 
standing and the source of his money. Gift cheques could be 
frozen if the official cannot explain how they were obtained. 
  The law, he said, will also apply to MPs. 
  "If MPs suspected of involvement in narcotics trafficking 
cannot prove how they amassed their wealth, their assets can be 
subject to forfeiture," he said. 
  Mr Prasit said it was necessary to explain the benefits of 
the law to parliamentarians to avoid opposition in Parliament. 
  He said the law would not infringe on the rights and 
freedoms 
of individuals. 
  "The United States, which has a constitution which provides 
the greatest protection for the rights and freedoms of 
individuals, also has an anti-money laundering law." 
  People who violate the law should not receive protection and 
law-abiding citizens should not be afraid of the law, he said. 
  The CCC chief said he had sought the opinions of about 20 
bankers on the law and was told they all support it. But they 
doubt it will ever be passed into law. 
  The bankers also expressed concern that the law would be an 
additional burden on banks and financial institutions and might 
affect the financial system as well as the economy. 
  Mr Prasit insisted the anti-money laundering law would help 
protect honest businessmen against the use of dirty money in 
lawful businesses. 
  "If someone dumps 500 million baht of drug money into a 
business, honest competitors will be seriously affected," he 
said. 
  The Office of the Narcotics Control Board, Bank of Thailand, 
Finance Ministry and Chulalongkorn University's Law Faculty are 
drafting similar bills. Their bills will be combined and 
incorporated as one, said Mr Prasit. 
  ONCB secretary-general Chawalit Yotmani said Deputy Prime 
Minister Amnuay Virawan, who oversees ONCB affairs, had 
appointed a panel comprising officials from the Finance and 
Justice ministries, Bank of Thailand, Stock Exchange of 
Thailand, Chulalongkorn University, Police Department, ONCB and 
Supreme Attorney-General to draw up the anti-money laundering 
law. 
  Pol Gen Chawalit said Thailand already had a law allowing 
authorities to confiscate the assets of people convicted of 
financing drug businesses. 
  The law was introduced in 1992 and 11 offenders have since 
had their assets seized, he said. 
  Pol Gen Chawalit said the ONCB would pursue the 
investigation 
into allegations by the United States that former Chat Thai MP 
Thanong Siripree-chapong was involved in smuggling marijuana to 
the US.

  [Excerpts] This settlement of some 400 families stands out 
from the rest of the villages in Tambon Phon or other tambons in 
Phon Sawan District--thanks to the wealth brought to the village 
by ganja (marijuana) cultivation. 
  Marijuana plants used to grow here in every household. They 
were the only cash crop which brought wealth and prosperity to 
the village. 
  And although marijuana cultivation was virtually abandoned 
some 10 years ago due to increased suppression, the legacy left 
behind by the lucrative narcotics trade can still be seen. 
  Television antennas pop up from the rooftop of most houses. 
Electrical appliances that offer the comfort and convenience of 
urban life such as refrigerators, television sets, record 
players, video recorders and portable radio cassette players can 
be seen in almost every household. 
  The modern wooden houses of Ban Taai are in direct contrast 
to the dilapidated shacks which typify poverty-stricken villages 
in the Northeast where farners try to scratch out a humble 
living by growing legal agricultural products in drought-plagued 
fields. 
  But nothing speaks so eloquently of the easy money to be 
made 
from ganja than the villagers themselves. 
  "Previously there were more than 100 pick-up trucks in our 
village. But now less than 20 are left," said Prasob 
Tarranavadee, assistant headman of Ban Taai. 
  Obviously, most of the cars were sold by their owners to 
supplement their meagre earnings after their source of income 
from marijuana cultivation dried up. Others might have had 
their trucks reclaimed by the dealers because they could not 
afford the instalment payments. 
  It was said that during their heyday each family could earn 
more than 100,000 baht from buyers for each annual marijuana 
crop. Almost every young man and woman helped in the 
cultivation and harvesting of marijuana plantations. 
  But today, 10 years after the government suppression drive, 
Ban Taai is a village of old people and children. Most young 
men and women left the village "to chase the rainbow." The 
women mostly work in factories while the men work at 
construction sites in Bangkok or in foreign countries. 
  A handful of men who chose to stay behind continue to till 
the land and eke out out a living by planting rice, chili and 
other cash crops. Others, however, offer their expertise in 
marijuana cultivation to financiers in other areas if the money 
is right. 
  "I used to accept an offer of 3,000 baht a month pay 
excluding free lodging and food allowance from a financier to 
plant marijuana in Pha Nok Khao in Tambon Phu Kradueng of Loei 
Province," one of the "self acclaimed experts" told the Bangkok 
Post. 
  He said marijuana plantations should be cultivated for just 
3-4 months before being harvested. The most enduring task is at 
the beginning when marijuana plants must be cared for and manure 
must be used to nurture the plants, he said. 
  He said his job was accomplished after the harvest, when 
someone else would take care of marijuana transportation, he 
continued. 
  The man disclosed that the normal hiring price for an 
"expert" now was about 6,000 baht, which does not include free 
lodging and food allowances. Sometimes, he said, the experts 
were hired to plant or supervise the cultivation of marijuana 
crops in Laos. 
  Apart from the monthly salary, some financiers also offered 
a 
small percentage from the sale of the marijuana crop to the 
experts, said the man. Sometimes, an advance payment which is 
called a "land opening fee" was made to the experts, he added. 
  "One of my friends accepted a contract to supervise 
marijuana 
cultivation in Kammuan of Laos. He claimed that sometimes a 
helicopter with a few farangs would drop by to pick up the 
marijuana two or three times a year," said the expert, who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. [passage omitted] 
  The expert admitted that planting marijuana in Laos involved 
a higher risk because of the uncertainty of law enforcement in 
Laos. In most cases, he said, the cultivation was done in a 
form of joint venture with Thai investors putting in 40 per cent 
investment and their Laotian counterpart 60 per cent. 
  He also said that the experts risked being murdered if the 
marijuana consortium was betrayed to the authorities. 
  Apart from Thais, several H'mong tribesmen have been hired 
to 
plant marijuana in Laos. Fibre from the plants can also be used 
for weaving. 
  Inhabitants of Ban Taai who used to earn 1,500 baht per 
kilogramme of dry marijuana are now making only 12 baht per 
kilogramme from the sale of chili, said Mr Prasob, the assistant 
headman. 
  "We can plant other crops. But there is the problem of 
marketing," he admitted. 
  Without marijuana, their golden crop, the village is quiet 
and lifeless. A scarecrow is put up in front of every house 
purportedly to save the surviving members from the "ghosts of 
widows." 
  "Several old and young men succumbed to these ghosts in 
recent months. So we had to build scarecrows to guard every 
household," said the assistant headman. 
  An informed source said that despite the fierce suppression 
campaign, marijuana is still secretly planted among other cash 
crops in Phon Sawan, Tha Uthen, Ban Paeng and LSri Songkhram 
districts. Mixing crops makes detection of marijuana crops 
difficult from the air. 
  The planting season normally begins in May when rain begins 
to fall, he said. 
  The source further said because of the pressure applied by 
narcotics suppression officials, marijuana fields are now mostly 
in Laos along the Mekong River because the plants consume more 
water at the initial stage. 
  Only a small amount is smuggled into Thailand to be exported 
to third countries, said the source, adding that the bulk of the 
drugs are transported to Danang in Vietnam befor being smuggled 
abroad. 
  A police officer interviewed by th Post admitted that some 
officers allowed large-scale marijuana cultivation to take place 
in Nakhon Phanom. 
  Most of the eligible voters in Ban Taai voted for Por Ped or 
Thanong Siripreechapong, former Chat Thai MP, in previous 
elections. 
  "We used to help one another. We used to get rich together," 
said several villagers. 
  A sign hung in front of Thanong's office in Tha Uthen 
District carries the message "Por Ped is happy to serve you." 
But the volume of visitors to his office seeking to get "rich 
together" has dropped significantly since he was implicated in 
narcotics trafficking.

<F P=106> [Article: "Cannabis Cultivation Grows Despite Efforts of </F>
Moroccan Government"] 
  [Text] In October 1992, Morocco--France's largest supplier 
of hashish and the world's largest exporter of the 
drug--launched a campaign to suppress trafficking in this 
traditional local cash crop. In its soon-to-be-published annual 
report ("Etat des drogues, drogues des Etats", Collection 
Pluriel, Hachette, 120 French francs, 1994), the Geopolitical 
Drugs Observatory (OGD) concludes the monarchy's drug policy has 
shown little in the way of results. 
  It came as quite a surprise in October 1992 when King Hassan 
II announced, in a meeting with his principal ministers, the 
launching of a "relentless" war against drugs. Since then, the 
"surprise" has taken a long time to materialize, according to 
the OGD: "More surface area is devoted to cannabis cultivation 
than ever before, and the trafficking rings, which continue to 
enjoy protection from high-level officials, seem little affected 
by enforcement efforts that have focused mainly on low-level 
traffickers," notes the OGD, which works for various 
international institutions, in its annual report. 
  As successor to the Kif and Tobacco Authority established by 
the French colonial regime in 1926, Morocco's Agriculture 
Ministry each year reports the acreage devoted to each crop. 
Including "kif," as cannabis is called locally. Based on the 
ministry's official statistics, the regime disclosed in autumn 
1992 that the illicit crops were grown on some 50,000 hectares 
[ha]. 
  Despite Rabat's pronouncements, those crops are still there. 
In 1993, "cannabis covers at least 65,000 ha in northern 
Morocco," says the OGD, which was given access to data acquired 
by the ministry's Economic Statistics Service. Moreover, the 
total does not even take into account the increase in greenhouse 
cultivation of the illicit crops in the Agadir region which the 
U.S. State Department claims to have detected. The growth in kif 
cultivation far exceeds any increase that could be attributed to 
traditional usage, since in 1980 illicit plots covered only 
5-10,000 ha. 
<H5>  Short-Lived Zeal </H5>
  In their "relentless war" on drugs, Moroccan authorities 
have shown little staying power. Admittedly, some 5,000 soldiers 
were deployed between the Algerian border and Tangier, and 
corrupt high-level officials were dismissed or transferred. The 
first half of 1993 also saw a significant increase in highway 
checkpoints in the northern part of the country. And there were 
a handful of spectacular enforcement operations, mostly against 
Europeans found in possession of small quantities of the drug. 
  "But zeal for enforcement disappeared with the onset of 
summer and harvest time," notes the OGD, which also points out 
that "enforcement efforts mostly targeted small-time trafficking 
rings... At the same time, a number of notorious traffickers 
were haled into court only to be acquitted, a development that 
surprised almost everyone." The conclusion: Not only do 
"increasing well-organized Moroccan rings engage in 
international marketing of derivatives of cannabis produced in 
Morocco," but "this increase in trafficking would not have been 
possible without pervasive corruption at all levels of the 
bureaucracy." 
  Breaking with the habitual passivity of Moroccan authorities 
in this domain, the royal promises of autumn 1992 were meant to 
impress the international community, especially the European 
Union. Rabat expected its commitment would lead to large 
assistance inflows both to fight the drug rings and to stimulate 
development in the northern provinces, where kif as a 
monoculture had undeniably improved the peasants' standard of 
living. But it seems that Morocco, reverting to its traditional 
position in the matter, has decided for now to remain the 
world's largest cannabis exporter. The interior minister has 
told his European interlocutors that if present trends 
persist--with Italy and Germany apparently inclined to follow 
Netherlands' lead and decriminalize hashish--it would be a 
mistake for Morocco to eradicate crops that may sometime be 
legal in Europe.

  [Text] Peshawar -- After a break of three weeks, local 
people have again started holding protest demonstrations in the 
Tirah area of Khyber Agency. The demonstrations are being held 
against the presence of militia forces which have been stationed 
in the area for the last two years. A large protest rally was 
held yesterday with hundreds of tribals holding black flags and 
chanting slogans against the government and the administration. 
The demonstrators say that the presence of the militia has 
affected their lives and, therefore, they should leave the area. 
The demonstrators warned that the situation might become worse 
if the militia is not called off from the area within two 
months. The demonstrators claimed that the government promised 
to give them attractive incentives for alternative crops to 
poppy cultivation. But it has failed to fulfill that promise so 
far they claimed and threatened to resume poppy cultivation on a 
large-scale if incentives are not offered by September 1994.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Tackling Hard Drugs, Seriously"] </F>
  [Text] No one could have been cheered by foreign news 
reports recently that fresh sanctions were being imposed on 
Nigeria by the United States Government. Unlike last year's 
sanctions which had to do with the regress in the 
democratisation process, the latest are related to the 
increasingly urgent issue of the hard drugs trade. Presidential 
memorandum addressed to American officials is directing these to 
vote against all Nigerian request for financial assistance at 
the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and similar 
organisations. 
  The charge of the Americans is the complicity of the 
Nigerian 
government in the hard drugs trade, in the area of interdiction, 
law enforcement and prosecution of offenders. Specifically, they 
allege the uncooperative attitude of Nigerian officials in the 
extradition of suspects. They point to four cases of American 
request for the extradition of drug barons, only one of which 
has been honoured. Government's inaction in the other three 
pending cases, is evidence, they claim, of the protection which 
the suspects enjoy from the Nigerian government. 
  In view of the standing Cooperation Agreement between the 
two 
countries, these are indeed strange and unfortunate 
developments. Nigerian officials are wont to point out that the 
Agreement is subject to judicial process. In other words, it is 
too much to expect that Nigeria would immediately hand over 
suspected citizens for prosecution in America, without due 
process. Not only would this be a violation of Nigerian law and 
sovereignty, the rights of individual citizens could be 
infringed. For their part, the Americans profess understanding 
of this, but insist that even when clearly documented cases are 
prepared for that judicial process, they are frequently 
stone-walled by the Nigerian government. Such action, they 
charge, can only be deliberate. 
  The American insistence is premised on claims by its high 
officials including the Assistant Secretary of State for 
International Narcotics Matters, Robert Gelbard, that more than 
a third of all heroin imported into the United States, comes 
from Nigerian syndicates. The Nigerian Ambassador to the United 
States, Zubair Kazaure denies this, citing in support of his 
contention of a report of the U.S. International Narcotics 
Centre which declares an improvement in the level of drug 
cooperation between Nigeria and the America for the year 1993. 
  Neither of these recriminatory claims are of any avail in 
the 
concrete question of tackling a pervasive menace which hard 
drugs represent in the world today. There are those who argue 
that the American sanctions might in fact be counter-productive 
in the long run. The nonchalance or outright complicity of 
government officials is unlikely to be significantly altered 
merely on account of these sanctions, given our experience with 
unelected governments. On the contrary, the ordinary citizenry 
which would be more directly affected by them might in fact 
become more sympathetic with the cause of the government. 
  One area, for instance, in which citizens have been 
particularly resentful concerns the treatment meted out to 
Nigerians abroad. On the strength of certain foreign campaigns, 
the image of the average Nigerian is of a drug-peddling, 
uninformly [as printed] dishonest character out of dupe his 
foreign second in any business dealings. What this eventually 
translates into is incessant and unjustifiable harassment of 
Nigerians around the airports and seaports of the world. 
  It is impossible to deny the criminal activities of some 
Nigerians abroad. But against the background of many upright and 
excellent services rendered by Nigerians in innumerable 
institutions, workplaces and environments around the world, the 
negative campaign provides only a partial and foreshortened 
picture of the country and its people. 
  Lest this foregoing be interpreted as support for or denial 
of the American allegation of government complicity in drug 
trafficking, we must hasten to say that the perception of the 
National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) can only lend 
credence to the allegations. The NDLEA seems not to have been 
able to find its feet since its creation. Dogged by frequent 
leadership changes, occurring in circumstances which raise 
questions of probity and competence, this Agency has so far 
failed the nation. When it is not bungling investigations and 
prosecutions, it is being trailed by serious scandals 
significantly related to drugs. 
  In the past one year alone, the organisation has had no 
fewer 
than four heads, and been involved in many more scandals and 
failings. And, therefore, unless a serious re-organisation takes 
place, we might as well write it off as a hindrance and not a 
help in the fight against drugs. 
  The inability of the government and its agencies to act 
promptly and with determination in this fight, gives the 
impression that hard drugs are not at all a matter of serious 
concern to the nation. They cannot be more wrong. Research shows 
that an unfailing pattern in this menace is that from being a 
drugs transit country, Nigeria would eventually graduate into a 
consuming one. Already, among the offsprings of the well-to-do 
in our society, remarkable changes in the consumption pattern 
have been noticed. Given our societal propensity for negative 
habits and trends to grow rapidly, it cannot be long before 
Nigeria becomes one of the drug-consuming nations. 
  The drugs menace cannot but be seen as a global problem. 
Consequently, only in a concerted way, through a network manner 
can the world approach the fight against it. Nigeria must 
contribute seriously to this struggle. Even if Nigeria were not 
so directly implicated, this would still have been a serious 
obligation. As it is, Nigeria by acts of omission and 
commission, is perceived to be right at the centre of the 
problem. It is not a responsibility to shirk or take lightly. 
The government can only convince the world of its innocence by 
the determined way it sets out to join the rest of mankind in 
fighting what is really a global scourge. Recent dismissals at 
the NDLEA can only be a first step.

  [Text] Various types of narcotic drugs and psychotropic 
substances weighing 8,811.4874 kilogrammes with an estimated 
street value of N1.3 billion were seized from 453 suspects, last 
year by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). 
  These figures, according to Mr. Abiodun Adesola, the Acting 
Press Secretary of the Agency, do not include the massive haul 
of a special high grade heroin of 248.3 kilogrammes with a 
conservative estimate of N1.2 billion ($300 million) imported 
from Bangkok, Thailand. The cargo was intercepted at the Apapa 
Wharf, in Lagos last December. 
  "A cursory look at the figures showed that the number of 
arrests and the quantity of seizures were far more in 1993 than 
the previous years," Adesola stated in a statement yesterday. 
  He attributed the arrests and subsequent seizures to the 
takeoff of two additional zonal commands at Warri and Maiduguri 
which began operations last year. 
  According to him, marijuana, cultivated locally, with a 
total 
seizure of 7,461.744 kilogrammes maintained the number one slot 
on the list of hard drugs seizures made last year. 
  This was followed by cocaine, 1,308.6697 kilogrammes, 
heroin, 
39.2862 kilogrammes and other psychotropic substances, 1.825 
kilogrammes. 
  On quarterly basis, the fourth quarter of the year was the 
period the highest number of arrests were made, 145 suspects in 
all. Next was the first quarter with 121, followed by third and 
second quarters with 100 and 87 suspects. 
  Adesola said the agency recorded her highest number of 
arrests within the year under review in March with the arrest of 
55 suspects. October and November followed with 52 and 47 
arrested suspects. 
  However, the largest drug haul was recorded in February with 
2,724.896 kilogrammes of hard drugs seizure. 
  This was followed by the 1,647.2515 kilogrammes seizure in 
October while November of the same period under review was next 
with 1,419.3283 kilogrammes. 
  "One striking observation made in the Agency's operations, 
last year was the seizure of psychotropic substances like 
Amphatamines and pemoline, a development which may be attributed 
to renewed vigilance on all types of hard drugs covered in the 
mandate given to the Agency instead of only concentrating on 
cocaine and heroin trafficker," he added.

  [Text] Budapest, 23 Jun (MTI) -- In the first five months 
of 1994, the number of violations on Hungary's borders was four 
per cent lower than in the same period last year. However, the 
count was still rather high, at 10,000 cases, Customs Guard 
Brigadier-General Balazs Novaky told the press in Budapest on 
Thursday. Most of the infringements were cases of trespassing, 
but there have also been examples [of] organized crime, such as 
smuggling people, weapons, and stolen cars, he added. 
  Border guards say the most frequent violation on the eastern 
frontier sections was the presentation of false documents, while 
at the western border there were many tourists who had legally 
entered Hungary but tried to leave it via the "green frontier". 
Most of the trespassers were Romanians, followed by Turks, 
Ukrainians, and Bulgarians. 
  Hungarian frontier guards siezed about 200 kg of narcotics 
and 1 kg of explosives this year, along with 13 hand grenades 
and over 30 hand arms. 
  Brigadier-General Kalman Kiss summarized the experiences of 
frontier guards in enforcing the latest legal measures 
concerning foreigners, which became effective on May 1 of this 
year. 
  He said that Hungarian frontier guards uncovered 37,000 
violations in the first five months of 1994, and prevented 
32,000 foreigners from entering Hungary. In addition, they have 
taken 1,200 foreign citizens to a public camp to put them up 
until they can be transported home. Frontier guards invariably 
take measures against travellers who do not possess adequate 
papers. They are also strict on people who do not have access 
to enough money to cover the costs of their stay, as such 
foreigners are likely to take black work or commit crimes, 
Kalman said.

<F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PA News, in Corfu] </F>
  [Text] [British Prime Minister] John Major today launched a 
five-point plan to tackle crime and fraud across Europe to show 
citizens that the EU can influence their daily lives. 
  The Prime Minister told the European Summit in Corfu it was 
time to bring European policies closer to the people in the wake 
of a Euro election which demonstrated widespread apathy about 
the EU's relevance. 
  He said the two key issues were unemployment and crime, and 
he urged his fellow European leaders to back a new initiative to 
beat crime and fraud. 
  Mr Major said that since the start of the year enough 
cocaine 
had been seized in the EU countries for 24 million individual 
doses--with a street value of 840 million pounds sterling. 
  "We must protect our young people from this trade and we 
need 
a clear action plan," he said. 
  The Major proposals are: 
  --A European convention on intelligence gathering and 
anti-crime cooperation completed by October 
  --A concerted attack by the newly-created Europol, based in 
The Hague, and national authorities on drug trafficking and 
organised crime 
  --The close involvement of the countries of central and 
Eastern Europe in anti-drug measures 
  --A conference on drugs and organised crime under the 
forthcoming German EU presidency 
  --Agreement to streamline national criminal laws and 
punishments for cross-border crime and fraud by the end of this 
year. 
  Intelligence gathering was the key to success, Mr Major 
said, 
but he stopped short of suggesting that Europol should involve 
an active police force in addition to its role as a data and 
information exchange system for crime prevention squads in the 
member states. 
  It was now time to give the drugs problem top priority in 
Europe, with the accent on education as well as investigation. 
  Mr Major said fraud cost Europe's taxpayers millions every 
year. He cited a recent investigation which uncovered subsidies 
of 65 million pounds sterling which were paid out by Brussels in 
the form of grants for non-existent supplies of wheat. 
  He wants the Corfu Summit to include a firm commitment, 
particularly on drugs, in its final conclusions tomorrow 
afternoon. 
  The Prime Minister was speaking in the first round of talks 
at the summit, following an invitation from Greek Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou to address one of the most pressing problems 
confronting the EU.

<F P=106> [Report by Heinz Vielain: "Number of First Drugs Consumers </F>
Increases By 20 Percent"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The number of narcotics addicts in Germany 
is growing, the Federal Government reports. The number of first 
consumers of drugs increased to 4,538 between January and May. 
That is 20.4 percent up on the same period last year. 
  The government's drug expert, State Secretary Eduard 
Lintner, 
told WELT AM SONNTAG that in the first five months of 1994, 643 
people were killed by drugs. He warned against "misinterpreting 
the Karlsruhe ruling on liberalizing small amounts of drugs for 
personal use." 
  Lintner fears that "the danger of a clear increase in 
consumption will be played down if prosecution is predictable." 
From the beginning of January to the end of May, 566 kg of 
heroin were seized in Germany. In addition, authorities seized 
246 kg of cocaine, 1,540 kg of cannabis, 125 kg of marijuana, 45 
kg of amphetamines, and 7,121 LSD doses. 
  Asked about the ongoing discussion about small amounts of 
hashish or marijuana for personal consumption going unpunished, 
the drugs expert said: "Guidelines that clearly determine small 
amounts in absolute figures lead to prosecutions also being 
predictable for dealers and their instigators." Dealers could 
disguise themselves as consumers of small amounts. That way 
they could easily evade the police. 
  Since North Rhine-Westphalia's SPD [Social Democratic Party] 
government decided in May to liberalize the possession of small 
amounts of heroin, cocaine, and other narcotics, Federal Health 
Minister Seehofer (Christian Democratic Union--CDU) has examined 
whether the narcotics law needs to be amended. An additional 
struggle among the parties can be expected, because Frankfurt's 
SPD Mayor Andreas von Schoeler wants to have the courts 
decontrol the possession of heroin for heavy addicts. 
  On the activities in Frankfurt, which is governed by a 
red-green alliance, the parliamentary manager of the CDU/CSU 
[Christian Social Union], Juergen Ruettgers, told WELT AM 
SONNTAG: "Liberalization of heroin means giving the go-ahead for 
the drugs mafia in Frankfurt; with Frankfurt a city that has 
almost 10,000 drug addicts, of whom some 5,000 are consumers of 
hard drugs. With 146,000 criminal offenses a year, Frankfurt is 
a stronghold of crime in Germany."

  [Text] One in two drug users in Greece is under 18, 
according to the findings of a recent survey conducted by 
Thessaloniki's Aristotelian University and presented at a joint 
Education Ministry-Teachers' Association news conference 
yesterday. 
  The survey found that 46 percent of drug users are under 18 
years of age, while 43 percent are in the 19-25 years' age 
group. It also found that 70 of 1,000 students questioned said 
they had used illegal drugs at least once. 
  Education Minister Dhimitrios Fatouros said the government 
would launch a massive awareness campaign in schools to teach 
junior and high-school students about the dangers of drug use 
and addiction. "More than 50,000 teachers will participate in 
the programme," he said. 
  But some local authorities seem unwilling to wait for the 
government to take the initiative. In the northwestern Athens 
suburb of Iraklio, the first professionally staffed counselling 
centre opened its doors this week.

<F P=106> [Article by Ian Burrell: "Police Rebel Against `Harsh' </F>
Cannabis Law"] 
  [Text] The majority of police forces in England and Wales 
have introduced the partial decriminatisation of cannabis, with 
first-time offenders allowed to escape with only a caution. 
  Four out of five constables questioned in a survey of 30 
forces last week admitted they had introduced the liberal policy 
for all first offenders caught in possession of cannabis for 
personal use. Three out of four said existing legislation on the 
drug was too harsh. 
  The chief constable of one Midlands force went further, 
demanding the drug's immediate legislation for personal use. He 
said that the use of cannabis was so widespread that prohibition 
had clearly failed and it was wrong to punish users. 
  The findings demonstrate a sharp divide between the opinions 
of police officers and senior politicians, most of whom support 
the existing drug laws. 
  The police's desire for a softer approach will be 
highlighted 
this week when the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) 
debates the issue at a conference to frame its new strategy on 
drugs. 
  The Midlands chief constable who wants to see personal use 
of 
cannabis legalised asked to remain anonymous because his views 
were so directly opposed to government policy. "The reality is 
that people possessing cannabis for personal use tend not to end 
up in court and I think that is right," he said. 
  "When I talk about legalisation I am talking about the need 
for recognition that people use cannabis and that punishment is 
not the solution to that problem. We need to move away from 
enforcement and look at education and other approaches to try to 
influence people in the same way that we do with drink and 
cigarettes." 
  On Wednesday, Keith Hellawell, the chief constable of West 
Yorkshire and chairman of the ACPO's drugs committee, will gauge 
the opinions of his colleagues with a view to drawing up a new 
strategy to fight the war on drugs, which many police officers 
admit is being lost. 
  The ACPO conference will also be addressed by Raymond 
Kendall, secretary general of Interpol, who said recently that 
all personal drug use should be legalised. 
  The practice of cautioning first-time cannabis offenders was 
pioneered by Merseyside police a decade ago before spreading 
across Britain over the last few years. "It has been a success 
story," said detective inspector Tony Doyle, from the Merseyside 
force. "We are seeing from our figures that 80 percent of people 
who are cautioned over drugs do not come to the attention of 
police again." 
  However, Michael Howard, the home secretary, and Tony Blair, 
the shadow home secretary, both reiterated their determination 
to keep the drug illegal last week. Howard is raising the 
maximum fine for possession of the drug from &pound;500 to 
&pound;2,500, through an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill 
currently going through parliament. 
  By contrast, several of the chief constables questioned in 
the survey said the higher fines would lead to more cannabis 
users being jailed for non-payment. The current average fine 
imposed by magistrates on cannabis users who are prosecuted is 
&pound;180. 
  Last night campaigners for reform of the drug laws accused 
politicians of being out of step with public opinion on the 
dangers and attractions of the drug. 
  "It is refreshing that professionals and top public servants 
in the police and criminal justice system are now accepting the 
case for reform. It is sad that the politicians are so out of 
touch," said Mike Goodman of Release, the drugs advice agency. 
  The Home Office said last night that it had no intention of 
relaxing the laws on cannabis. A spokesman said: "There are 
indications that more dangerous, stronger strains of cannabis 
are emerging and that the use of cannabis can lead to the 
further misuse of other drugs. Legalisation would send the wrong 
message to society."

<F P=106> [Article by John O'Leary: "Heads Tell of Drug Pushers Aged </F>
Eight"] 
  [Text] Head teachers launched a crusade yesterday to stamp 
out the growing menace of drugs in the playground. 
  Children, some only eight years old, had been suspended for 
pushing drugs, the National Association of Head Teachers' 
conference was told. Delegates in Eastbourne called for 
government action to warn the young about the dangers of drugs. 
  Martin Saunders, headmaster of a Stoke-on-Trent primary 
school, said that half the city's secondary schools had 
suspended pupils for drugs offences. He said children could buy 
cannabis for &pound;15 to &pound;20, heroin for &pound;5 to 
&pound;10, a tab 
of Ecstasy for &pound;12 and "speed" for &pound;5. "It is 
cheaper than 
getting drunk. For many young people who go out at the weekend, 
drug-taking is as common as having a drink." 
  Derek Gray, another head teacher in Stoke, said schools were 
reluctant to admit they had a drug problem. Mr Gray told of a 
boy who started sniffing lighter fuel at the age of 11, before 
turning to hard drugs. He died, aged 19, of a heart infection. 
  At the conference, David Hart, the general secretary, called 
for 22,000 extra teachers to be employed to halt the increase in 
class sizes and to implement changes in the national curriculum. 
Almost a quarter of pupils were now in classes of more than 30, 
he said. He criticised the National Union of Teachers for its 
boycott of national testing. 

  -  A study of East Yorkshire has discovered that children in 
the countryside are using drugs produced for pigs and some are 
experimenting with a sedative given to animals with mad cow 
disease. One Lincolnshire addict said the drugs "are more 
available than street illegal drugs."

Barons"] 
  [Text] There looked nothing particularly unusual about the 
consignment of concrete pillars Roy Clarke was directed to pick 
up on the Costa del Sol. But as soon as the Surrey lorry driver 
pulled out of the factory gates near Malaga, Spanish police 
officers descended on him. 
  They asked him to open the container he had just picked up, 
pounced on the concrete bollards and started to break them up 
with crowbars and pickaxes. Inside they found two and a half 
tons of cannabis--with a street value of &pound;7 million. 
  Roy Clarke was arrested for smuggling Spain's biggest ever 
haul of drugs. He has now been in Malaga prison for nearly four 
months awaiting trial. But he says he is innocent, arguing that 
he knows nothing about the contents of the bollards. 
  His British employers say they received instructions for 
this 
job from a third party, who has disappeared. 
  Stephen Jakobi, a lawyer with Fair Trials Abroad says: 
"There 
is no way Roy Clarke could be guilty. It would be impossible for 
him to see the drugs; and he was clearly not involved in the 
planning because he didn't know he was going to take this load 
until the day he picked it up. The faxes confirmed that. But the 
police wanted an arrest. This is a typical case of a lorry 
driver who never had a chance." 
  Roy Clarke is not the only one. The Foreign Office knows of 
nine cases of lorry drivers charged with smuggling drugs. David 
Higginbottom, general secretary of the United Road Transport 
Union says: "We're only now seeing the tip of the iceberg. It's 
a big problem now and it's set to get bigger. Drivers are being 
treated as scapegoats. 
  John Barber, a driver from Wales, was stopped on the 
Franco-Spanish border on September 30 last year. His load of 
tangerines, heading for Britain, was found to contain 240 kilos 
of cannabis resin. Although he said it was nothing to do with 
him and he had not been present when the load was packed, he was 
arrested and put into Bayonne prison for three months. 
  He was eventually freed on a technicality, but French 
customs 
have impounded his truck and, unable to make a living, he has 
been declared bankrupt and is about to lose his house. His MP 
[expansion not given] Cynog Dafis campaigned for his release 
because, he says: "I've known John Barber for a long time. He's 
transparently honest." 
  Roy Clarke's MP, Sir Archibald Hamilton, who has written to 
the Spanish Justice Minister about his case, points out that the 
real villains are elsewhere. "Clearly the people who are much 
more guilty are those who loaded the pipes on to the lorry. The 
driver is the easiest person to get hold of, but this is an 
incomplete way to smash up the drugs ring." 
  Drivers say they cannot be held responsible for their loads 
because they cannot be certain what they contain. 
  "Our job is to get the stuff from A to B," says Stephen 
Murray, who has been driving trucks around Europe for six years. 
"It's impossible to check what's in the container--they're 
either sealed or packed so tightly that you can't see in." 
  David Higginbottom of the URTU [expansion not given] says: 
"Drivers are like postmen. Nobody would ever dream of arresting 
a postman who delivered a package containing drugs. A driver has 
no more idea what's inside his truck than a postman has what's 
inside a letter." 
  Since European integration made movement around the 
Continent 
free and easy, police and customs officials have become 
increasingly concerned about the traffic of drugs by road. 
National forces have co-operated more closely to clamp down on 
it. The crackdown has led to more arrests and the number of 
Britons being held on drugs charges in the rest of the Continent 
jumped from 604 in 1992-93 to 753 in 1993-94. 
  But the problem, according to campaigners, is that the 
police 
are not just being conscientious, they are being over-zealous. 
  "I'm perfectly aware that in nine out of 10 cases the people 
are guilty," says Mr Jakobi of Fair Trials Abroad. "But I'm 
becoming increasingly aware of cases where they're not." 
  Lorry drivers are not the only victims of the crackdown. Car 
passengers have been made to answer for the contents of a car 
they do not own. Stephen Jakobi has 11 such cases in France 
alone. 
  Raymond Bickley, 50, a travel agent from Brighton, was 
released on bail last week after 18 months in jail. He was 
travelling as a passenger on his way back from a business trip 
to Torremolinos in Spain when customs officers in St Malo found 
45 kilos of cannabis in the car. "I was guilty only of being 
naive," he says. 
  Janet Johnston, director of the charity Prisoners Abroad, 
says: "Hardened drug smugglers are out to sell a product. 
They're always looking for new ways to get through and they 
don't care who gets into trouble so long as it's not them. At 
the same time, the police are really sharpening up." 
  The problem seems set to increase. "Drugs are emotive," says 
Stephen Jakobi. "But if you're wrongly accused, it doesn't 
matter what you're innocent of--what's important is that you're 
not guilty."

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Biryukov: "The Battle on the Opium </F>
Front: Fourteen Tons of a Virulent Narcotic Valued at Almost 
$650 Million Were Recently Burnt in the Furnace of the Tashkent 
Aluminum Alloys Plant. . . ."] 
  [Text] The international narcotics mafia has included 
the southern regions of the CIS in the field of its activity. 
The "transparent" borders and the unstable situation create 
practically ideal conditions for drug dealers. Possibly, this 
compelled the undersecretary general of the United Nations, the 
executive director of the United Nations International Program 
for the Monitoring of Narcotics, Giorgio Giacomelli, to visit 
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other "hot" spots in this respect. 
Indeed, only jointly can one cope with the "narcotics fire" that 
is swiftly getting out of control. Understanding this, Russia 
and Tajikistan have concluded an agreement on cooperation in the 
exchange of information on the question of the fight against 
narcotics. Kazakhstan has come out as the initiator of the 
signing of such a document among the Central Asian CIS 
countries, Azerbaijan, Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan. The special 
services and the militia are making every effort to take control 
of the situation. What the results of this are, judge for 
yourself. 
  . . . Machinist Vladimir Kruchinin sent a bucket filled with 
briquettes in red "sweet" wrapping, into the furnace. A moment 
later, a powerful column of poisonous dark smoke leapt up high 
into the sky. The fire of 1,500 degrees left only water from the 
narcotics. Among those who supervised the destruction of the 
hashish was also the undersecretary general of the United 
Nations, the executive director of the United Nations 
International Program for the Monitoring of Narcotics, Giorgio 
Giacomelli. "I have had the occasion to participate in a 
multitude of actions connected with the cutting off of the 
illegal dissemination of narcotics, but such wizardry 
[feeriya]," Giacomelli acknowledged, "I see for the first time. 
. . ." 
  For us, too, this is the first such action. But, judging by 
everything, not the last. 
  Already since the times of the Great Silk Route, Uzbekistan 
has played the role of an important staging post, through which 
many thousands of intercontinental cargoes passed. With the 
collapse of the [Soviet] Union and subsequent weakening of 
border protection, international narcotics dealers did not fail 
to use the convenient transportation arteries--dealers for whom 
the transparent borders inside the countries of the Commonwealth 
mean additional income and the reduction of risk in the 
transportation of the goods. 
  How are the narcotics conveyed? Only a few examples. 
  Thirteen metric tons of hashish turned out to be in boxes 
with raisins in transit through Uzbekistan. Another batch, 
weighing about two metric tons, was concealed under the packing 
for walnuts. . . . 
  Today almost every investigator who is involved with the 
transit of narcotics has among his material evidence a grooved 
metal pipe--with magnet attachments. This is today the most 
powerful method of transporting narcotics in batches of up to 
several kilograms. The cavity of the pipe is filled with 
narcotic substances and tightened up with a lid. Then, with the 
help of the magnet, it is fastened to any metal surface--the 
plating of a barge, a river boat, the bottom of an automobile, a 
railway car. . . . 
  Thus, more than 14 metric tons of narcotics were detained at 
the border of Uzbekistan and destroyed in the fire. Such a catch 
cannot even be boasted of by the specialists working in the 
region of the so-called "golden triangle." However, this also 
inclines the special services of Uzbekistan to a serious manner. 
You know, according to the assertions of analysts, we succeed in 
detaining only 12 percent of the poison that is being 
transported.

<F P=106> [Report from Kazakhstan by Oleg Kvyatkovskiy] </F>
  [Text] It is obvious that the south and the southwest of 
the republic have also been closely enrolled in the well-known 
"golden triangle" of intense activity of the international 
narcotics mafia. 
  This is also indicated by concrete figures. In only four 
months of this year, 2,178 crimes connected with narcotics were 
registered in Kazakhstan--not so long ago, that many did not 
accumulate even during a five-year plan! Two hundred eleven 
cases of the sale of the killing "grass" have been exposed. 
Thirty-four hideouts, where people of all ages and nationalities 
"got kicks" were destroyed. Almost two metric tons (!) of 
narcotics were removed. Criminal proceedings were instituted 
against 1,276 people. Called to account were another 929 
consumers of the poison; in all, 14,000 of them have now been 
registered in Kazakhstan. Multiply by 10--and you will obtain 
more or less the real number of potential killers, thieves and 
users of violence, capable of doing away with their own mother 
for a "a small amount of vodka." 
  Prior to 1986, in Kazakhstan, as throughout the entire USSR, 
they obstinately pretended that "we do not have and will never 
have any drug addicts in our country." Now for already eight 
years running people in the republic "demonstrate constant 
concern" and "they are considering a state program of struggle". 
But while all the new documents on "counteraction" are being 
discussed, the narcotics business is not losing time. It has in 
abundance what the state does not have now--money. And thus, the 
possibility of ordering their "music."

<F P=106> [Report from Tajikistan by Lyubov Latypova] </F>
  [Text] According to data of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs of Tajikistan, during the past 5 years the volume of 
narcotics seized in the republic increased 46-fold, and the 
number of registered crimes connected with drug addiction 
doubled. There was a 49-fold increase in the area sown to opium 
poppy and hemp. There are whole settlements that live by virtue 
of this trade. For example, last year in Pendzhikentskiy Rayon 
of Leninabad Oblast alone, six metric tons of raw material was 
gathered, which is much more than in the preceding years. 
However, significantly fewer criminal proceedings were 
instituted apropos of this. 
  The leading place in this distribution is occupied by Gornyy 
Badakhshan, where the problem of drug addicts has acquired 
economic and political significance. In the recent past this 
area, which politically remains in Tajikistan, has been trying 
to keep the center out of its affairs. The difficult financial 
situation of the republic and the physical absence of money have 
made narcotics its peculiar equivalent, on the basis of which 
businessmen acquire goods in neighboring Uzbekistan and 
Kyrgyzia. In its turn, payment for the poison going to 
Afghanistan is effected through foodstuffs, fuel, and industrial 
consumer goods. 
  They export it by different paths, the chief one of which is 
the Pamir route, which operates the year around, to the Kyrgyz 
city of Osh. From here the narcotics are being distributed to 
the CIS countries and beyond, to the West. The transportation is 
going so successfully that in the Fayzabad District on the 
Afghan side a whole plant was built for the production of 
heroin, part of which was already discovered on our border. The 
saddest thing is the fact that not only local inhabitants have 
joined in this process, who are pushed into this by need, fear, 
or the presence of relatives in controlling drug business 
groupings. Since the beginning of this year, three employees of 
the collective peace-keeping forces were detained with 
narcotics. One of them is the navigator of a military aircraft. 
  Russian newspapers have repeatedly written about the fact 
that the drug business in the Pamir Mountains is controlled by 
some criminal groupings. The latest news from this oblast is a 
large-scale sorting out, as the result of which the leader of 
one of them by the name of Khafiz was killed. 
  According to one of the versions, he did not take part in 
the 
civil war--he was serving a sentence in places not so far away. 
Having returned home last year, he discovered the participation 
of Afghan mujaheddin in Pamir affairs, he came out against this, 
and he was killed. According to another version, not very 
different from this, he tried to unite groupings into a single 
whole and he did not find cooperation. 
  The struggle against the drug business complicated by many 
circumstances. For example, by the fact that, in the absence of 
proper legislation in regard to this question, the law 
enforcement organs up to now have been forced to be guided by 
the legislative acts of the Union that has long since ceased to 
exist--laws on the basis of which consumers of narcotics are 
relieved of responsibility. This is why whole links of the 
transportation and the storage of narcotics raw material are 
slipping out from under the control of the militia.

<F P=106> [Article by O. Gridasova: "The Poison Needle and Children: </F>
Petersburg Is One of the Leaders in Number of Juvenile Addicts"] 
  [Text] On 14 April our newspaper published the 
letter "A Poison Needle," written by a mother whose son had died 
of drugs. This tragic story confirmed yet again that drug mania 
is firmly taking hold in our homes. St. Petersburg has probably 
the greatest number of identified juvenile drug addicts in 
Russia. And the average age of this juvenile drug addition in 
our seaport city keeps declining; the percentage of children 
hooked on the opium group of drugs is growing at an incredible 
rate: Last year 89 percent of all juvenile drug addicts used 
opiates. Over the first quarter of this year this figure had 
already risen to 93 percent! Are we prepared for this disaster? 
Judging by the fact that the city has just one juvenile 
department for... 15(!) beds operating as part of the city drug 
treatment clinic, our preparedness is below average, to put it 
mildly. But even this one department is being rent by problems. 
Juvenile department chief Tatyana Slavina and psychologist Olga 
Koltsova describe them. 
  "Our department was set up in March 1991 and originally was 
intended to accommodate 25 beds for patients between 15 and 18 
years of age. Of course, these age boundaries were frequently 
violated in accepting patients, but within reasonable bounds. 
The problem was different--the real number of juveniles 
undergoing treatment at any given time. Fifteen was a sort of 
critical level, after which the department began to literally 
"split at the seams," which made it very difficult for medical 
personnel to keep a handle on the process and the children under 
control. 
  "Treating drug addicts is not an easy job. People suffering 
from drug addiction are very aggressive: Their will is destroyed 
but at the same time they are very inventive and are capable of 
conceiving many sophisticated methods of deceiving a doctor or a 
nurse in order to get hold of the drug they crave. 
  "To these traits that are common for all drug addicts, the 
juvenile environment adds its own age-related peculiarities. 
  "First, a juvenile is mostly peer-oriented in his behavior, 
and if the sociopsychological microclimate in the department is 
conducive to giving up drugs, the chances for success in 
treating the children increase dramatically. And vice versa, if 
the work with the collective is not successful, treating each 
individual juvenile becomes nearly meaningless. 
  "Second, a specialist working with children knows that 
multiple-substance addiction is most common among them: These 
kids are going through a stage of so-called drug 
experimenting--they are looking for a drug that "suits" them 
most, or use whatever they can get their hands on. Therefore, it 
is very difficult for the medics to find an appropriate form of 
treatment in these conditions. 
  "Next, unlike adult drug addicts, who are capable of 
understanding the need (perhaps a last-chance one) for 
treatment, children completely lack the sense of danger inherent 
in drug use. The motivation to undergo treatment as a rule does 
not stem from this factor: A juvenile is brought in either by 
the militia or parents, but he will never come on his own. Which 
means he may run away at the slightest real opportunity. 
  "Finally, strange as it may sound, adults are more careful 
and neat: A veteran drug addict will rarely use a dirty syringe 
or an unpurified opiate (or other drug) solution. A juvenile may 
mix into the opium solution an inexpensive medicine--he usually 
has a money problem; a `dirty' drug costs less but will deliver 
the same kind of `high' as the pure one. 
  "So this work is not easy, and the department has gone 
through difficult experiences: We tried different methodologies 
for treating children--from complete freedom and democracy in 
relations with juveniles to strict compulsory measures. We read 
books and magazines, attended seminars held by foreign 
psychologists, until we understood that a child suffering from 
drug addiction needs first of all medical help (any 
psychotherapy is secondary) provided in a well designed 
environment. And the important part in this is the small number 
of children undergoing treatment in the department and the 
cyclical nature of accepting new patients, when a group is 
accepted at the same time and remains together until they are 
discharged four weeks later. 
  "A new patient coming into the treatment program has a 
ruinous effect on the others, and all our efforts, all the 
agreements we enter into with the juveniles when they are 
accepted, go down the drain. It is not the children's fault, 
since drug intoxication is a `psychological infection' of sorts 
and can be easily `transmitted' from a new patient to those who 
have just shaken off the burden of drug addiction. 
  "And we have already mentioned a strictly limited number of 
patients. 
  "Without adhering to these conditions, our work essentially 
turns into Sisyphean toil: The doctors want to help the 
children, but the existing overcrowding does not allow them to 
do what is best for successful treatment. The result is failure; 
the staff disappointed and dissatisfied with their work. So if 
the city truly wants to help juvenile addicts, they have to give 
us real help." 
  The opinion of professionals: St. Petersburg should 
have not one department for juvenile drug addicts but several 
clinics, where different methods of treatment will be offered. 
  Let us note that so far this is not universally accepted. 
Moreover, sometimes there is talk about closing the only 
"unprofitable" clinic. It is ineffective, they say. But what is 
meant by effectiveness in this case is the number of patients 
"treated" per certain number of beds, while the quality of 
treatment apparently does not bother anyone. 
  Meanwhile juvenile drug addiction in St. Petersburg is 
growing. Over the past three years it has doubled. And this is 
if we are to believe official statistics.

<F P=106> [Report by Russian Academy of Sciences Press Service under </F>
the "Teletype" rubric: "Semaks Is a New-Generation Drug"] 
  [Text] Clinical trials of an original psychotropic 
preparation of a peptide nature have been completed. It is 
semaks, developed by the Institute of Molecular Genetics [IMG] 
and the Biology Faculty of Moscow State University. In terms of 
its structure semaks is a synthetic analogue of a short fragment 
of the stress hormone--adrenocorticotropic hormone. This short 
fragment is interesting because of its clearly expressed 
stimulating influence on the highest forms of activity of the 
central nervous system: the formation and reproduction of a 
memory trace, motivation, attention, and emotional state. The 
analogue synthesized at the IMG possesses the same range of 
physiological action, but it takes tens of times longer to take 
effect than the prototype. The analogue synthesized at the IMG 
has traveled the long path of essential preclinical trials and 
the development of the technology for producing the substance 
and its medicinal form. This has resulted in the creation of a 
medicinal preparation in a form convenient to use--nose 
drops--which has been named semaks.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of recent 
environmental reports monitored from media in FBIS Abidjan 
Bureau and EAU coverage areas from 6 to 17 May. 
<H5>  Ghana </H5>
  The Volta River Authority [VRA] "banned activities like 
farming, tree felling, bush burning, and charcoal production 
along shores bordering the shoreline of the Volta Lake in six 
districts." The districts are (Asujaman) Kpandu, (Jasikan), 
Manya Krobo, (Fanti Akwa), and Kwahu South. A statement issued 
in Accra yesterday by the VRA explained that these activities, 
which have recently become rampant, are causing serious land 
degradation along the lake. The statement said apart from 
"degrading the environment, these activities have resulted in 
soil erosion, earth movement, landslides, and silting at the 
in-take area of the Akonsombo power plant. It noted that this 
reduces the output of the power plant and also creates 
maintenance problems for the VRA." 
  The statement further explained that bush burning in the 
area 
near the Akosomba dam and the port exposes the area to fire 
hazards due to the storage and loading of petroleum products at 
the port. The VRA appealed to "district assemblies and chiefs in 
the affected areas to assist in the efforcement of the ban to 
prevent further degradation of the environment around the lake."

  President Alpha Oumar Konare received Mr. Billo Soumana, 
Niger's minister of water supply and the environment, on 17 May. 
The latter was accompanied by the executive secretary of the 
Niger River Basin Authority. After the audience, Billo Soumana 
spoke to Alhassan Al- Mohamed: "The Niger River Basin Authority 
was established in 1964 with the objective of rational, 
equitable, and sustainable management of the basin's water, 
fisheries, and forest resources. Today, we are faced with a 
problem, because the Niger River itself is dying. So the Niger 
River Basin Authority must resume its activities in order to 
salvage the river. We discussed the possibility of saving the 
river, which is everything to us." 
  Responding to a question, the minister stated that the river 
was being threatened by the low level of rainfall, and though 
there could be no direct action concerning rainfall, the 
environment could be restored. He disclosed that certain 
sections of the river were silted, and that desilting projects 
must be carried out and the basin protected. He added: "There 
is another threat which is little known to Africans, and that is 
the water hyacinth. This plant is unknown to Africans because 
it originates from Latin America, and has just appeared in 
Africa, threatening all our water resources." He concluded: 
"Efforts by individual countries on their own stretches of the 
river cannot save the river, and are doomed to fail if all the 
other countries concerned do not take the same measures."

naira to effectively combat ecological and environmental 
problems." The commissioner for works, housing and transport 
announced this in Asaba when the staff and students of the 
Administrative Staff College of Nigeria paid him a courtesy 
call. He further said that "about 15 million naira would be 
needed monthly to provide temporary relief from coastal erosion 
and flooding." He used the occasion to urgently appeal to the 
National Committee on Ecological Disasters to come to the aid of 
the state, by providing the necessary financial and technical 
assistance. [Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English 1500 GMT 15

  [Excerpts] Kisumu, 25 May (KNA) -- The government has 
assured the consumers of resources based on the Kenyan side of 
the Lake Victoria that they have nothing to fear and should 
continue with their activities as usual. 
  Reacting to various press reports to the effect that 
thousands of decomposing corpses being swept into Lake Victoria 
through River Kagera was a big environmental risk, Nyanza P.C. 
[provincial commissioner] Mr. J.K. Kaguthi stressed that 
available scientific fact confirms that the Lake Victoria waters 
of the Kenya side were safe, including the popular species of 
fish such as Tilapia and Nile Perch. [passage omitted] 
  The team [as received] noted the chances of our fish or our 
waters being contaminated or polluted as a result of the 
decomposing bodies from the Kagera River mouth are remote and 
people should continue eating their fish. The government noted 
that all relevant agencies, including the provincial security 
committee, marine and medical experts will continue to monitor 
the situation when the need arises.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 24 (XINHUA) -- This, China's largest 
metropolis and economic center has a basic system in place to 
prevent deterioration of the environment. 
  "The amount of major discharged pollutants has dropped and 
the quality of the local environment has improved vastly," Lu 
Shuping, a specialist in environmental protection, said. 
  "But noise pollution is getting worse," noted Lu, also 
director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Environmental 
Protection. 
  Shanghai, with a population of more than 13 million, is 
China's largest industrial city. 
  To ensure that its people live in a clean environment, the 
municipal government has adjusted its industrial structure and 
industrial locations in a scientific and rational way in recent 
years. At the same time it has concentrated on the treatment of 
water and air pollution, along with the construction of 
infrastructural facilities and basic industries. 
  As a result, the director noted, the quality of water and 
air 
has improved to some degree, but noise still exceeds the set 
standard due to the construction of urban facilities and the 
increase in the number of motor vehicles. 
  According to the latest statistics, the amount of discharged 
industrial waste water in 1993 was 6.52 percent less than in 
1992, and that of water after treatment increased by 5.47 
percent. 
  The rate of industrial waste water treated last year reached 
82.3 percent, up 5.3 percent over the previous year. 
  According to the statistics, the amount of discharged 
domestic sewage last year went up by 105 million tons and that 
of sewage treated by 96.9 million tons. 
  All this shows that Shanghai discharges an average of 5.567 
million tons of waste water a day, of which 63.1 percent is 
industrial-use water and the rest domestic sewage. 
  According to the expert, the amount of sulphur dioxide, 
smoke 
and industrial dust, which are regarded as major pollutants in 
waste gases, shrank by 14.1 percent, 15.9 percent and 3.4 
percent, respectively, last year over 1992. 
  The rate of utilization of solid industrial pollutants is 
83.7 percent and that of the treatment of garbage 71.6 percent. 
  According to the director, the main pollutants in local 
water 
are ammonia, nitrogen, chemicals and oil. 
  A recent survey on the upper reaches of the Huangpu River 
showed that the water quality was better than in 1992 and the 
amount of dust in the air over the city was less than in 1992. 
  Lu said that the municipal government is working out an 
overall program to clean and beautify the environment so as to 
control pollution and improve the quality of the surroundings. 
  The program includes construction of sewage treatment, waste 
water discharge and garbage disposal projects. 
  In addition, the municipal government will strengthen noise 
control, including banning the use of motor vehicle loudspeakers. 
  It will also develop cooking gas facilities and plant more 
trees, flowers and lawns in and around the city, Lu said.

<F P=106> [Report by Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- The China Committee for 
Authenticating Environmentally Labeled Products was founded in 
Beijing today, signalling a period of substantial development in 
our country's "green industry." The committee's establishment 
will facilitate the improvement of the quality and reputation of 
environmentally labeled products, the development of domestic 
and foreign markets for such products, and the promotion of 
coordinated environmental and economic development. 
  Environmental labels, also known as ecological or green 
labels, are a kind of corroborative trademark which indicates 
that the products in question meet specific demands for 
environmental protection during the entire process, from the 
development and exploitation of raw and semifinished materials 
to production, utilization, and recovery or scrapping; that they 
pose no harm to the ecology or cause little pollution; and that 
they facilitate the regeneration and recovery of relevant 
resources. At present, more than 20 countries or regions in the 
world have adopted these labels or are drawing up plans for 
adopting them. 
  A leading environmental problem currently facing China is 
the 
serious wastage of resources and outmoded production technology. 
In light of its own national conditions and drawing on the 
experiences of foreign countries, China will first provide 
environmental label authentication services for environmentally 
harmful products which can be rendered significantly less 
noxious. Chief among them are products with low levels of 
toxicity and harm, energy-and water-saving products, products 
with low emissions, and recoverable, low-noise, and 
biodegradable products. Our country has prescribed and unveiled 
its first set of technological requirements for six 
environmentally labeled products. They apply to household 
refrigerators with low levels of chlorofluorocarbon [CFC], 
CFC-free aerosols (hair sprays and mousse), water-based paints, 
unleaded gasoline, recycled toilet paper, and silk products. 
  The China Committee for Authenticating Environmentally 
Labeled Products, which was established by the State 
Environmental Protection Bureau with the authorization of the 
State Technology Supervision Bureau, is the only third-party 
authentication agency which verifies various environmentally 
labeled products on behalf of the state. The committee, which 
is composed of specialists from environmental protection 
departments, economic management departments, scientific 
research institutes and academies, quality inspection 
departments, and relevant mass organizations, is headed by Xie 
Zhenhua, director of the State Environmental Protection Bureau. 
  The design of the Chinese environmental label consists of 
green hills, blue water, the sun, and 10 rings, signifying that 
"all people have joined forces to protect the environment on 
which mankind depends for survival."

  [Text] Shenyang, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's 
Liaoning Province has set up 37 nature reserves to protect rare 
animals, plants and landscape. 
  An official with the Liaoning Provincial Environmental 
Protection Bureau said that the reserves are home to 97 rare 
animals and several rare plants on the state's protection list 
including the red-crowned crane, bear, sable, Mongolian gazelle, 
sika, red deer and otter, as well as ginseng in the plant 
category. 
  He said that in the reserves, specialized protection teams 
have been set up. Every year, the province allocates special 
funds to equip the team with fire prevention equipment and for 
scientific researches. 
  Scientific personnel are also undertaking a series of 
investigations and research programs to survey the wildlife 
resources in the reserves. 
  The Laotieshan Nature Reserve on snake island in the 
province 
was set up in 1979 and is now a major stop for migrating birds, 
including red-crowned cranes, swans and eagles, in northeast 
China. 
  Since the reserve was set up, hundreds of thousands of birds 
have been saved from slaughter. 
  In the northeast section of snake island, the number of 
pallas pit viper, the only kind of poisonous snake on the 
island, has reached about 17,000, an increase of 5 percent per 
year since the reserve was established.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, May 23 (XINHUA) -- Three counties in 
the Taihangshan Mountain Region of north China's Hebei Province 
have launched a campaign to auction the right of use of barren 
hills in a bid to effectively implement one of China's 
afforestation projects. 
  Also under auction are barren valleys, wastelands and 
uncultivated mountain slopes. 
  China's land law stipulates that all land, including 
mountains and rivers, is state property. Therefore, what has 
been auctioned is the right to explore the undeveloped areas. 
Underground minerals, however, are excluded. 
  Hebei provincial sources said that Zhanhuang County has sold 
the right of use for some 11,000 ha [hectares] of uncultivated 
areas, more than 60 percent of the county's total such areas. 
Pingshan and Tangxian Counties have ``auctioned" off another 
11,600 ha of such areas. 
  The Taihangshan Mountain Range, winding through 110 
counties, 
cities and districts in Hebei, Henan and Shanxi Provinces and 
Beijing, has a mountainous area of more than 12 million ha. The 
Taihangshan Mountain Afforestation Project, one of China's 
largest afforestation projects in full swing, has been written 
into the "21st Century Agenda of China". 
  According to the project, by the year 2000 the total green 
area in the Taihangshan Mountain Region is projected to top nine 
million ha and the forest cover rate there will climb from the 
current 18.1 percent to 43.6 percent. 
  The three counties have promulgated a set of policies 
stating 
that all capable individuals, enterprises, institutions and 
departments can participate in the bidding for the right to 
develop barren areas, either individually or jointly. 
  According to the policies, which set no limitations on the 
area of land a bidder can offer to buy, the auctioned barren 
areas can be inherited, leased or transferred before the auction 
contracts expire. 
  They also stipulate that the bidding winners must strive to 
achieve the initial afforestation target set down by related 
departments for the first three to five years. Otherwise, the 
auction deal will be invalidated and the areas covered by the 
contracts re-auctioned. 
  An official at the Forestry Department of Hebei Province 
said 
that the auction of the right of use of barren areas is an 
experimental reform measure that has a direct bearing on 
agricultural property rights relations in the countryside as 
well as on the interests of farmers. 
  He added that the reform is also a bold experiment to 
integrate the land with the market. 
  The official said that the long-term limit applied to 
auction 
deals, generally ranging from 30 to 70 years, has helped form a 
direct and stable relationship between investment and economic 
returns. 
  This has triggered farmers' enthusiasm to channel more money 
and labor into improving the uncultivated areas, he said, adding 
that in the places where the reform measure has been introduced, 
economic and social benefits have become obvious. 
  Qin Wenping, Forestry Bureau director of Zhanhuang County, 
said that since the county first started auctioning the right of 
use of undeveloped areas in 1990, the county's forest cover rate 
has risen from 13.7 percent to 20.4 percent. 
  He also said that the county's annual output of fruit has 
doubled to 20 million kg and per capita income increased by some 
1000 yuan (more than 120 U.S. dollars). 
  Official sources said that the auction practice has also 
been 
started in Henan, Shanxi and Liaoning Provinces.

  [Text] Manila, May 20 (XINHUA) -- The Asian Development 
Bank (ADB) today approved a technical assistance grant of 
600,000 U.S. dollars to China for the Chang Jiang (Yangtze 
river) water and soil conservation and environment project. 
  The technical assistance will assist China in strengthening 
its capability to manage and develop the upper and middle 
reaches of the Chang Jiang basin in a economically viable and 
environmentally sustainable way, the Manila-based bank said. 
  With the assistance, seminars and workshops will be held for 
arousing greater awareness of environmental conservation among 
officials from the nine provinces included within the upper and 
middle reaches of the basin. 
  The technical assistance also will help reinforce linkages 
among government ministries to strengthen the concept of 
integrated basin management in order to achieve more effective 
flood control and to optimize efforts in economic development 
and environmental protection, said the ADB.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Ruichang (0491 3843 1603)] </F>
  [Text] Bridgetown, 5 May (XINHUA) -- At the "Global 
Conference on Sustainable Development for Developing Islet 
Nations" -- a UN high-level meeting held in Bridgetown, the 
capital of Barbados -- on 5 May, Liu Chengguo, head of the 
Chinese Government delegation, pointed out that the principle 
defined at this meeting for the establishment of partnership for 
sustainable development should become the basis of international 
cooperation in the fields of environment and development. 
  Liu Chengguo believes that the sustainable development of 
developing islet nations is an important element of global 
sustainable development. Developing islet nations' efforts to 
develop their economy and protect the environment are 
contributing to attaining the goal of worldwide sustainable 
development. 
  Speaking of ways to establish this kind of partnership for 
sustainable development, Liu Chengguo said that it should be 
built on mutual respect and equal treatment. He said: All 
countries -- big or small, strong or weak -- should be equal 
partners in international cooperation; the basis for cooperation 
comes only in this way. Partnership will be out of the question 
if either side should indiscreetly criticize the other at every 
turn, always try to force on the other a certain model or 
policies and measures suited to some other countries, or even 
take monetary or technical aid as political chips for putting 
forward unreasonable demands regarding the recipient country's 
internal affairs. 
  Liu Chengguo said: This kind of partnership should also 
closely link the resolution of global environmental problems 
with that of practical problems facing developing islet nations, 
and help developing islet nations attain the two complementary 
goals of sustained economic growth and environmental protection. 
  Liu Chengguo pointed out: This kind of partnership should 
embody the principle of "common but differentiated 
responsibilities." He said: Climatic changes, rising sea 
levels, pollution of ocean and seacoast, and other environmental 
problems are not caused chiefly by islet nations, but they have 
become the first victims of them. Many problems left over from 
the colonial or trusteeship periods continue to restrict their 
social and economic development. To effectively resolve the 
environmental problems facing developing islet nations and help 
them attain sustainable development, therefore, the 
international community, particularly the developed nations, 
should make more commitments. 
  In conclusion, Liu Chengguo said: Being a developing nation, 
China understands very well the difficulties facing developing 
islet nations and sympathizes with them. China has established 
friendly relations and cooperation with many developing islet 
nations and is ready to further and actively explore and 
strengthen multilevel South-South cooperation in various forms 
in the hope of bringing about common development and prosperity. 
  The United Nations began the "Global Conference on 
Sustainable Development for Developing Islet Nations" on 25 
April. Government delegates from China and about 100 other 
member states of the United Nations attended the meeting. Held 
after the UN conference on environment and development in 1992, 
this meeting has the special purpose of resolving developing 
islet nations' peculiar environmental and development problems.
