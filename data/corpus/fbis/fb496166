  [Text] Guiyang, May 23 (XINHUA) -- China has succeeded in 
its water and soil control project on the upper reaches of the 
Chang Jiang river, the country's longest river, bringing 26,300 
square km of eroded land under control and raising forest 
coverage by 33 percent. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, Chen Junfu, an official in 
charge of water and soil conservation in the Chang Jiang River 
Water Conservancy Committee, said that the water and soil 
erosion control project started in 1989 on 795 rivers and 
streams in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hubei 
provinces. 
  To carry out the government-funded construction, local 
farmers have been improving farmland and building various water 
conservation projects and water diversion canals. They have 
also planted economic and water and soil conservation trees in 
the project areas. 
  A recent survey of 169 of the rivers involved showed that 
the 
harnessing percentage has now reached 87, and 72 percent of the 
soil there has been retained. The per capita arable land in the 
area has gone up from 0.035 hectares to 0.07 hectares. Each 
farmer has added 0.02 hectares of fruit trees. 
  The official said China will increase investment in the 
water 
and soil erosion control project so as to bring 93,000 square 
kilometers of soil erosion land under control before the end of 
the century, with special focus on the three gorges dam, a 
multimillion dollars hydroelectric project being built on the 
Chang Jiang river.

  [Text] Taiyuan, 9 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According to 
the environmental protection work meeting of Shanxi Province 
which was held a few days ago, environmental pollution in the 
province has been very serious. With the exception of the six 
cities directly under the provincial government, which have 
managed to initially check the spreading contamination of the 
atmosphere and surface water, the ecology of medium-sized and 
small cities in the province is being increasingly disturbed, 
and environmental pollution in some villages and towns is 
worsening. 
  Shanxi is China's energy and heavy and chemical industrial 
base. The province produces approximately 290 million tonnes of 
coal a year, and its consumption of coal increases at a rate of 
about 10 percent a year. At the same time, it releases one 
million tonnes of soot and 900,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a 
year. These objective factors cast a shadow over Shanxi's 
already seriously polluted environment. 
  The results of the monitoring of the quality of the 
atmospheric environment of 17 cities in the province show: The 
daily average value [zhi 0237] density of suspended particles 
over the year is 216 to 833 micrograms per cubic meter, 
surpassing the state's grade-2 standard of atmospheric 
environmental quality. The figure for some major cities of the 
province is 130 percent higher than that for the cities in north 
China. 
  The results of the monitoring of the 11 major rivers and 
their tributaries in the province show: Although the major 
rivers have not yet been contaminated, the river sections whose 
waters are good for drinking and industrial and agricultural 
purposes are very few, and 85 percent of the river sections are 
contaminated to varying degrees. The sources of drinking water 
and its quality in many cities have thus been adversely affected. 
  This grim situation has attracted great attention from the 
province's environmental departments. They expressed readiness 
to take an active part in comprehensive decisionmaking, to 
strengthen the building of the legal system, and to strive to 
urge the provincial people's congress to promulgate before 1997 
the "Regulations of Shanxi Province on Environmental 
Protection," the "Regulations of Shanxi Province on Prevention 
and Control of Atmospheric Pollution," and relevant 
administrative rules and standards.

  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- China has succeeded in 
applying rare earth to over 800,000 ha of forests, a world 
record, according to an official from the Ministry of Forestry. 
  Rare earth elements are a new type of growth regulators. By 
using scientifically-made fertilizers mixed with rare earth 
elements to dress seeds, dip roots or spray leaves, the growth 
of trees is promoted. 
  China started to use rare earth in agriculture and forestry 
in the 1980s, the earliest in the world. In 1992 the technology 
was popularized and applied to over 30 strains of trees, 
including walnut, date, pear, Chinese chestnut and Chinese 
hawthorn as well as grape vines. 
  Research results show that the output of a fruit tree 
cultivated with fertilizers containing rare earth elements 
increased by 10 percent to 40 percent. Besides, the fruit 
contains more sugar, Vitamin C and other nutritious elements. 
The 50 pilot counties in Beijing municipality and the Provinces 
of Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Shandong and Henan invested about 
one million yuan (about 115,000 U.S. dollars) in the application 
of rare earth to fruit production, and they managed to increase 
their output of fruit by a total of 50 million kg, worth 100 
million yuan. 
  Scientists also found that by applying rare earth, pine 
seeds 
will germinate earlier and pine trees will grow more quickly. 
Besides, by spraying rare earth elements on them, deciduous 
trees in north China remain green longer in the autumn. 
  In recent years the ministry of forestry, and provincial and 
city departments of forestry have taken various measures to 
popularize the technology of applying rare earth elements, 
including holding training classes, lectures, exhibitions and 
on-the-spot teaching.

  [Text] A crackdown on illegal logging activities in Koh 
Kong Province -- conducted jointly by a deputy state secretary 
for economy and finance and a deputy state secretary for 
agriculture -- has proven successful. The five-day raid was 
launched on a hideout in the province where lawless activities 
took place to destroy trees and export logs. Four foreign 
barges loaded with some 5,000 cubic meters of wood were seized 
pending a decision by the government in accordance with the law. 
  Chea Peng-chheang, deputy state secretary for economy and 
finance, told REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA upon his return to Phnom Penh 
on the afternoon of 25 May that the operation had been 
successful. There were no clashes or casualties even though the 
stronghold the operational team raided -- where destructively 
felled trees were stored for unlawful export -- had previously 
been inaccessible. The deputy state secretary added: We seized 
a crane, four barges, and 500 cubic meters of logs suspected of 
being illegal. 
  A Singapore company called Maxtron, the owner of one of the 
four seized barges, is angry about the crackdown, arguing that 
it forgot to bring its authorization along on the barge, and 
that it had permission and paid taxes for the export of 1,000 
cubic meters of wood, including the seized logs. Who would have 
dared to issue such authorization? 
  Commenting on this issue, Chea Peng-chheang said: We have 
not yet made any decision on the seizure. It is up to the 
government to solve this problem. 
  May Sam-oeun, the deputy state secretary for agriculture who 
also participated in leading the operation, said: The seizure 
of those barges was correct. The Agriculture Ministry is 
perfectly entitled to make arrests and seize the means of 
transportation and logs if the owners do not have authorization. 
The ban on log exports became effective 1 April 1994. 
  It should be pointed out that the crackdown on illegal 
logging was launched following a report that the illegal export 
of logs from Koh Kong Province was continuing, and after a 
terrifying clash between a combined team that sealed the Sre 
Ambel pass and a gang protecting the log export merchants. 
  May Sam-oeun added: We achieved complete success this time, 
unlike the unsuccessful operations we carried out with forestry 
officials in recent months. Some of those officials, he added, 
continue to issue log export authorizations to a number of 
foreign companies in violation of the government's ban on log 
exports. He did not elaborate on the cause of the first 
operation's failure. 
  Commenting on the capture of two members of the combined 
team 
by the gang protecting the log exporters following a clash on 18 
May, Chea Peng-chheang said: These two officials have already 
been released unharmed by the gang without any preconditions. 
The primary goal of the 130-member operational team was to 
crack down on the armed gang that fired at a combined team in 
Sre Ambel. They all fled before the reinforcement group arrived, 
however. It is not yet known who the ringleader of the gang is, 
but there is already a hint about his identity.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Restricting Industries That Cause Pollution"] </F>
  [Text] Sarwono Kusumaatmaja, minister of state for the 
environment, has warned that the governmemt will put a limit on 
businessmen wishing to invest in industries that will pollute 
the environment. Industrial plants will also be relocated to 
restricted areas. 
  Minister Sarwono was speaking at a coordinated meeting on 
environment and water polllution, which was chaired by Hartarto, 
coordinating minister for industrial and trade affairs, on Pulau 
[Island] Air, near Jakarta recently. He said that the 
government will phase out the operational permits of pulp and 
paper companies that use chlorine, mercury, and sulphur in their 
productions. The government will also prohibit new investment 
in projects that are not environment-friendly. 
  It is understandable that participants focussed their 
attention on ways to overcome the environmental impacts of toxic 
waste throughout the meeting. This is in line with the 
post-Uruguay Round talks on exports strategy, whereby products 
are highly competititive in the world market. Indonesian 
manufacturers are required to act together on environmental 
protection because the environment has become an important 
economic asset. They have to assure consumers in the developed 
countries that they are serious about dealing with environmental 
issues, otherwise their export products will be rejected by 
these countries. 
  Indonesian exporters should pay serious attention to the 
demands of the world market for more environmentally-friendly 
products to take advantage of the new GATT rules on market 
access signed in Marrakesh, Morocco, last April. 
  At the meeting, it was also mentioned that at least 51 
percent of Indonesia's industrial products are targeted for 
countries that apply eco-labelling rules to their imports. 
Actually, Indonesian exporters can request the office of the 
minister of state for the environment to eco-label their 
products. Yet, to date not even one exporter has asked for his 
products to be inspected. We admit that all this while even 
without the eco-labelling rules being observed, some products 
were able to be exported; however, sooner or later their 
international competitiveness will decline. 
  Indonesia's products are exported mostly to EC member 
countries, which are calling for the application of the 
eco-labelling rules on products sold to them. The pressures not 
only come from the importing countries, but also from consumers 
who are environmentally aware. 
  We have to bear in mind that the manufacturers' commitment 
to 
environmental awareness is linked to the export of their 
products on the international market, otherwise their 
competitiveness could not be maintained. On the other hand, the 
closure of existing industries and the prohibition of new 
investment projects will decrease employment opportunities in 
the country. This situation will worsen social disparities 
because the manpower growth rate is higher than that of the 
growth rate of job opportunities. 
  Can the restriction and closure of industries that produce 
toxic wastes be the only alternative to comply with the world 
trade regulations or are there any other alternatives? 
Indonesia should study the facts on production technology from 
other pulp and paper manufacturing countries that have stopped 
using chlorine in their productions. The papers that are 
manufactured from pulps contain chloride, causing hazards to 
health when they are used for wrapping up food. Waste water 
from the pulp and paper industries reaches danger level when it 
contains over 1.5 kilograms of chloride per ton. 
  However, it is impossible to say that waste water from all 
industrial plants is free from chlorine because industries that 
produce toxic waste do exist. A plastics plant, for example, 
cannot replace the chlorine in its manufacturing process. 
  When these industrial plants are equipped with water 
treatment [preceding two words in English] facilities, it is 
possible to neutralize the environmental impact of dangerous 
toxic waste. Now the only problem left to be looked into is the 
system of waste disposal, or how the toxic waste is being 
handled, so that it will not endanger the surrounding area. To 
cite an example, the construction of a paper factory in North 
Sumatera turned into a political issue because the local 
residents and the owners of the factory could not reach a common 
settlement on the method of waste disposal. It will take some 
time before the government can impose a law on all industries 
prohibiting them from using any toxic material, and this has to 
be implemented in stages. The government cannot force 
industrial plants to stop using the dangerous chemicals in their 
production within a short time because this will create a 
distortion in the country's industrial policy. 
  Now that the government has shown its committment to 
coupling 
trade with the environment, obviously it will require wise and 
rational measures to cope with the circumstances so that 
industrial development in the country will not be jeopardized. 
The Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) is expected to be more 
selective when issuing operational permits to companies or 
industries by taking into consideration the possibility that 
they may pollute the environment, the use of dangerous raw 
material in their productions, the type of machinery to be used, 
and the type of goods to be produced. In this way, industries 
that are hazardous to the environment will be cut out.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "Scope" column: "Review of Plutonium Policy </F>
Shows STA-MITI Frictions"] 
  [Text] Japan will slow down its plutonium-related 
projects, a subpanel of the (prime minister's) advisory Atomic 
Energy Commission said in its report submitted on 18 May. The 
policy change was made in view of global concern over Japan's 
plutonium policy. On the other hand, the advisory report again 
stressed the need for continued studies on plutonium use, 
without indicating future directions of the project. The 
inadequateness of the report reflects frictions between the 
Science and Technology Agency [STA], which is seeking the 
promotion of nuclear fuel recycling, and the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI], which takes a prudent 
stance toward plutonium use. The industrial circles are voicing 
concern over the unclear policy review because they always 
become the sole sufferers from inadequate policies. 
<H5>  Speculations </H5>
  The advisory report by the Atomic Energy Commission is 
expected to become the outline of the government's new long-term 
program for atomic energy development, which will be revised for 
the first time in seven years. Therefore, STA and MITI 
finalized the report by carefully adjusting the interests of 
both sides. 
  For STA, nuclear fuel recycling is a big-scale and long-term 
project which guarantees much expenditures and manpower 
mobilization. STA cannot accept the scaledown of the project 
since the project is a "centerpiece" to demonstrate its presence 
in Kasumigaseki [bureaucratic circles]. On the other hand, MITI 
is looking for good excuses for checking STA's initiative. 
Based on studies by the (MITI minister's advisory) General 
Energy Council, a top MITI official recently stated: "The 
government should slow down its plutonium-related projects." 
  The experimental fast breeder reactor "Monju" cost the 
government over 600 billion yen, and in the next stage, electric 
power companies plan to build a demonstration reactor. The 
government intends to add nuclear fuel recycling costs to the 
price of plutonium, and the companies will have to buy the 
expensive fuel. MITI says it has to speak out for "silent 
complaints" from electric power companies. Since the ministry 
is in charge of Japan-U.S. relations, it has to give 
consideration to the U.S. policy on the DPRK's (North Korea's) 
nuclear weapons development. 
<H5>  Concern </H5>
  Atomic energy-related products occupy about 10 percent of 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Limited's total annual sales. The 
company has over 1,000 engineers working in this field. In 
response to the governmental decision on the setback in 
plutonium use, the company expressed its concern over the policy 
review, saying: "In line with the policy review, we will have 
to slow down our technological studies." 
  According to the Atomic Energy Industries Council, the total 
amount of nuclear-related projects in 1992 reached 2.24 trillion 
yen. These contracts were received by 470 companies, including 
electric applicant manufacturers, heavy machinery builders, and 
constructors. 
  Taking subcontractors into account, the "atomic power 
business" involves many companies. For the last five years, 
there have been no plans for constructing new nuclear-power 
plants due to difficulties in finding local government bodies 
willing to accept nuclear-related facilities. Under such 
circumstances, "We are not happy" about a possible delay in 
orders for nuclear recycling facilities (as noted by a major 
electric appliance company). Yet, "We cannot move engineers to 
other sections because it narrows future business chances" (as 
noted by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries). 
  In addition, the advisory report imposes on the business 
sector a duty to provide a nuclear fuel processing plant for 
consuming surplus plutonium. The plutonium business costs 
companies a lot, no matter which ones remain or withdraw from 
the business field, and it will certainly hit consumers in the 
future as a utility fee hike. Dilemma in the unclear nuclear 
policy will inevitably trouble the business sector and consumers.

  [Text] Washington, May 24 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States vowed Tuesday [24 May] to create a joint health program 
for children to stamp out polio from the face of the world by 
the year 2000. 
  "We believe (this goal) is technically feasible," said 
Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs Timothy Wirth in 
announcing the joint program. 
  The program is a new "common agenda" initiative the two 
countries created Tuesday as part of a year-old bilateral accord 
to promote cooperation on global social and environmental issues. 
  Wirth said the two countries also agreed to pool their aid 
resources and launch a second child health initiative to develop 
an inexpensive, "one-fits-all" children's vaccine to fight 
disease in developing countries. 
  In addition, the United States and Japan agreed to expand 
their "common agenda" plan on narcotics control, the protection 
of coral reefs, and the expansion of global changes research in 
Asia and Latin America, the two sides said in a statement 
released after a general meeting of the U.S.-Japan Common Agenda 
for Global Cooperation. 
  The "common agenda" program is the least controversial part 
of a highly contentious framework agreement the two countries 
concluded in July last year to define a "new economic 
partnership" between the two countries. 
  By stepping up bilateral cooperation on global 
social-economic issues while fighting on the trade front, the 
two countries have shown that "you can walk and chew gum at the 
same time," Wirth said. 
  The two countries have not yet worked out details of their 
new child health program, but Wirth said it involves bilateral 
cooperation in research and development, plus production and 
distribution of children's vaccines for use in developing 
countries. 
  "We believe that aggressive cooperation between the two 
countries...can lead to the eradication of polio worldwide by 
the year 2000," Wirth said. 
  Under the "common agenda" program, Japan and the United 
States have already agreed to pool their resources to control 
global population growth, battle the AIDS epidemic in developing 
countries and promote worldwide environmental projects. 
  A new environmental program approved Tuesday calls for 
providing financial aid to the Philippines to build a 
biodiversity training site at Subic Bay to protect lowland rain 
forests. 
  The two countries also pledged to finance a community 
resource conservation and development program in Papua New 
Guinea aimed at encouraging tribal clans to preserve endangered 
forests by promoting income alternatives. 
  On the AIDS front, the United States and Japan agreed to put 
six countries -- the Philippines, Indonesia, India, Ghana, Kenya 
and Egypt -- on their "priority" lists for a joint U.S.-Japan 
AIDS-fighting assistance program. 
  The two countries have so far pledged to provide up to 12 
billion dollars by the year 2000 to fight AIDS and control 
exploding population growth in the developing world.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- A Ministry of Finance panel 
will propose the introduction of an indirect tax aimed 
specifically at preserving the environment, ministry sources 
said Friday [27 May]. 
  The proposal by a working group of the Institute of Fiscal 
and Monetary Policy, a think tank affiliated with the Finance 
Ministry, will be part of a package of recommendations on how to 
create a more environmentally friendly society through fiscal 
and monetary policy. 
  In a final report on the theme, to be issued in late June, 
the group will also urge the government and private firms to be 
more concerned with environmental conservation in their 
activities. 
  The proposed indirect environment tax would be added to the 
prices of manufactured goods, with the tax ratio set depending 
on the amounts of energy used to make the products. 
  The group will also recommend that private firms disclose 
data relating to their activities both benign and harmful to the 
environment, such as the amount of industrial waste generated 
and the amount of investment made for ecology preservation. 
  It will also ask the government as well as private banks to 
lend more to ecology-protecting projects and less to those 
focused only on economic interests. 
  Other ideas to be included in the report are the 
introduction 
of garbage-collecting fees and a review of the current farming 
methods that depend heavily on chemicals.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The U.S. Forces in Japan 
have informed Tokyo that they have "fiscal problems" in paying 
their share of court-ordered compensation totaling hundreds of 
million yen to residents near a U.S. air base suffering from jet 
noise, government officials said Friday [27 May]. 
  Under the bilateral status of forces agreement, the U.S. 
Forces are required to cover 75 percent of compensation 
payments, while the Japanese Government covers the remaining 25 
percent. 
  The Defense Facilities Administration Agency and the Foreign 
Ministry will soon launch negotiations with the U.S. Forces on 
how to deal with Washington's fiscal constraints, the officials 
said. 
  In February last year, the Supreme Court dismissed demands 
by 
residents near Yokota Air Base in Tokyo for banning night and 
early morning flights there, but awarded them 112 million yen in 
compensation for noise pollution in the past, upholding two 
lower court decisions. 
  Tokyo, after having paid 160 million yen, including 
interest, 
to some 128 Yokota residents by last December, asked the U.S. 
Forces in March to refund their share of the sum, a demand which 
was rejected. 
  On March 30 this year the Tokyo High Court, in another 
Yokota 
lawsuit, again rejected a ban on night flights but ordered the 
government to pay 724 million yen in compensation, including 
interest, to 596 residents near the base, acknowledging that the 
jet noise inconvenienced them. Both residents and the 
government accepted the ruling in April. 
  Tokyo will soon urge the U.S. to shoulder its part of the 
burden for this case too, the officials said. They said the 
U.S. refusal to pay might be related to anticipated further 
compensation payments to noise victims near Atsugi Air Base in 
Kanagawa Prefecture. 
  The Supreme Court, having created a precedent with its 
Yokota 
ruling, in February last year ordered the Tokyo High Court, 
which had turned down compensation claims by Atsugi residents, 
to hold a retrial over the issue.

  [Text] Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, May 23 KYODO -- The 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) opened its annual meeting 
Monday [23 May] to uncertainty over a French-led proposal for a 
giant whale sanctuary in the Antarctic to prevent commercial 
whaling. 
  Taking part in the five-day meeting are delegates from 33 of 
the IWC's 41 member countries along with observers from 
environmental groups. 
  The Japanese delegation issued a statement ahead of the 
meeting claiming the sanctuary lacks justification on scientific 
and biological grounds. 
  The sanctuary proposal is meant only to hamper sustainable 
use of marine resources, said chief Japanese delegate Kazuo 
Shima, deputy head of the Fisheries Agency. 
  There is no choice but to depend on marine resources for 
long-term food supply for the next generation when a worldwide 
food shortage is expected in the early 21st century due to steep 
population growth, he said in the statement. 
  The proposed sanctuary runs from the Antarctic to the 40th 
parallel. 
  Opponents led by Japan and Norway have advanced a 
counterproposal calling for the sanctuary to be set southward 
from the 60th parallel and excluding minke whales, which have 
survived in bigger numbers than other species. 
  Any proposal requires a three-quarters' majority to be 
passed 
but chances of a sanctuary being approved are almost even, 
delegates said.

  [Text] Kushiro, Hokkaido, May 20 KYODO -- Police sent 
papers to the prosecutors office Friday [20 May] on two men 
suspected of illegally dealing in the Asian arowana, an 
endangered species of tropical fish. 
  Police said that tropical fish shop proprietor Yoshitaka 
Udagawa, 31, purchased an arowana from another tropical fish 
shop owner in Tokyo in June 1992. 
  The carnivorous fish, for which some tropical fish 
enthusiasts in Japan will pay hundreds of thousands of yen each, 
is protected under the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or the so-called 
Washington Convention, 
  Police said Udagawa failed to fulfill a legal requirement to 
register the arowana purchase with the Environment Agency within 
30 days. 
  He subsequently compounded his troubles with the law by 
selling the unregistered arowana in July 1993 to a man in 
Kushiro, Hokkaido, without informing the agency of the 
transaction. 
  Masato Sasaki, 38, the Arowana's new owner, similarly failed 
to comply with legal requirements when he purchased the arowana 
from Udagawa and resold it to a tropical fish shop in Obihiro. 
  Representatives of Traffic Japan, which monitors the illegal 
wildlife trade, said two separate cases of illegal trade of 
arowana in Japan were exposed in November and a third case in 
February.

  [Text] The month of May may be a time for spring delights 
but not when it rains. When it rains, a recent scientific 
research showed, acidity is sometimes as high as 100 times the 
permissible limit. 
  The two-year research, conducted jointly by the Environment 
Ministry and the Korea Meteorological Administration, in fact 
showed that 70 percent of the rain which fell between May 1992 
and August last year was acid. 
  "That makes the situation even worse is that 70 percent of 
the acid rain is believed to have resulted from impurities 
transported from China," one environment official said. 
  He observed that the rain which fell across the nation at 
the 
end of last week showed an acidity of 4.9 pH, making it one of 
the most acid concentrated precipitation this year. 
  According to the research, there were four instances during 
the surveyed period in which of rain had acidity levels of under 
3.6 pH much lower that the safe level of 5.6, and 32 occasions 
when the measurements were between 3.6 and 4.6 pH. One twice 
did it record over 5.6. [sentence as received] 
  The environment official noted that the ministry spent over 
10 trillion won over the past 14 years on reducing air and water 
pollution and the latest results show that they have largely 
been ineffective. 
  During the cited period, the concentration of sulfur dioxide 
fell from an average of 0.094 ppm (parts per million) to 0.023 
whereas those for acid rain has only been getting from bad to 
worse. 
  "It appears that the main problem pertaining to acid rain is 
the transportation of impurities, including chemicals, from 
China, resulting from brisk industrialization there, which were 
carried here by westerly winds, the environment official said. 
  He noted that acid rain is especially acute in metropolitan 
and other heavily populated areas.

<F P=106> [Report by Kim Chung-il] </F>
  [Text] On the basis of its judgment that the construction 
of nuclear waste storage sites--whose selection has been delayed 
because of opposition by local residents--can no longer be 
postponed, the government has planned to decide on candidate 
sites during the latter half of this year before beginning 
construction next year. 
  One high-level government official said on 22 May: "In 
connection with the selection of sites, the government has thus 
far conducted public relations activities for local residents 
with a view to pushing ahead with construction, on a priority 
basis, with the consent of those residents who want to have such 
a site built in their area. But, as seen in the large-scale 
demonstrations in Yangsan County, South Kyongsang Province, we 
have come to judge that the beginning of construction based on 
residents' consent is realistically impossible. In this regard, 
the government will make public its selection of sites during 
the latter half of this year before beginning construction early 
next year." 
  The same official added that in order to minimize residents' 
backlash against the selection of sites, the government has been 
trying to provide support for regional development 
plans--including projects whose materialization the residents 
have long aspired for their own areas' benefit--and to legislate 
relevant enforcement ordinances for guaranteeing jobs for the 
residents' livelihood, saying that all these government efforts 
are now at a final stage. He made clear the policy of pushing 
ahead with construction by saying: "Despite some residents' 
opposition, we will have no choice but to carry through the 
construction even by exercising government power." 
  He continued to say: "At the moment, nuclear waste coming 
from atomic power plants is being stored at the individual 
plants. But, it will reach a saturation point in 1999. It 
takes at least five to seven years to build a nuclear waste 
storage site. Therefore, it is a pressing question for us to 
begin construction early next year after making a final decision 
on construction sites within this year at the latest." 
  It has been learned that at present the government is 
searching for candidate sites among six areas, such as Anmyon 
Island, South Chungchong Province; Uljin and Yongil, North 
Kyongsang Province; Changhung, South Cholla Province; Kosong, 
Kangwon Province; and Yangsan, South Kyongsang Province--the 
sites a research team of Seoul National University has 
proposed--and among the areas where the existing atomic power 
plants are located. 
  Since the residents in the Yangsan area near the Kori Atomic 
Power Plant showed an interest in having such a site built in 
their area, the government has conducted public relations 
activities for them. But, in spite of the fact that more than 
80 percent of the area's residents have consented to having such 
a site built in their area, there have been demonstrations 
staged by some residents and outside forces such as 
environmental organizations. As a result, the government 
officially expressed its stance of giving up the construction of 
a site in that area on 22 May.

<F P=106> [Feature by Soumountha: "Nam Theun-Hinboun Hydro-Power </F>
Project Poses No Treat to Environment"] 
  [Text] "Nam Theun-Hinboun Hydro-Power Project poses no 
threat to environment." That was a welcome answer given to 
"VIENTIANE TIMES" reporters by the Project Manager. 
  In fact, this Hydro-Power project signed on April 20 augers 
well for the farming villages of the once-dry Nam Hai basin 
through possible small-scale irrigation systems taken into 
consideration under the Theun-Hinboun Hydro-Power Project. 
  Accessible by car, 300 km from Vientiane via Routes Nos. 13 
and 8, the project site is located roughly 100 km upstream of 
the place where Nam Theun meets the Mekong. The location thus 
lends itself perfectly for the purpose of developing an existing 
natural resource to earn foreign currency for the country. The 
Power Station when completed is expected to generate enough 
energy and income three times higher than that of Nam Ngum Power 
Station. 
  The combined technical know-how of the surveyors, designers, 
and construction engineers has resulted in this ingenious plan. 
The plan in brief is to construct an intake weir across Nam 
Theun at a point where a narrow mountain ridge separates the Nam 
Theun basin from the Nam Hinboun basin which lies at a lower 
level. The 240 metre difference in elevation will be fully 
exploited for power generation through a trans-basin diversion 
in that the water flow of Nam Theun will be diverted by 10 km of 
waterways into Nam Hai, a tributary of Nam Hinboun, eventually 
to the Mekong about 30 km upstream of Thakhek. In actual fact, 
water from Nam Theun will flow along a tunnel cut through the 
mountain, then down a 300 metre long inclined steel-lined 
pressure shaft, along a 650-m long steel-lined pressure tunnel 
to the power station on the other side of the mountain. The 
power station has an installed generating capacity of 210 MW 
(Megawatts). The water will then be discharged into Nam Hai 
through a 4-km long tailrace canal. 
  The 230 KV (Kilovolt) transmission line strung directly to 
the Thai border at Thakhek will be 100-km long. Beside the 
foreign currency earned, the Theun-Hinboun Power Project 
envisages power supply to meet future demands in Savannakhet and 
Thakhek, if the demand is high enough to justify the cost of a 
sub station. 
  Theun-Hinboun Power Project is the first attempt for private 
participation in the power sector in Laos. 
  This run-of-river hydropower development will be developed, 
owned and operated by the Theun-Hinboun Power Company Ltd., 
(THPC). Substantially all the power generated will be sold to 
the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). 
  THPC is the combined efforts of Electricite du Laos (EDL, 55 
percent), Nordic Hydropower AB (NH, 25 percent) and MDX Power 
Company Ltd, (MDX, 20 percent). 
  THPC is established with a capital of U.S. dollar 110 
million. Asian Development Bank provides a U.S. dollar 60 
million loan towards EDL's equity contribution. THPC's debt 
financing will be arranged from a mix of commercial sources and 
export credits with a 30-years concession period. 
  Actual construction on site will begin at the end of this 
year's rainy season, and the Project will be commissioned in the 
third quarter of 1997. Commercial operation is expected to 
commence September 1, 1997. 
  Nordic Hydro Power (NH) will manage implementation of 
project 
and be responsible for operation while MDX Public Co. Ltd., 
Thailand is to handle accounting and financial management 
services. Local staff will be trained and deployed to the 
maximum possible extent. 
  There will be no resettlement or loss of cultural heritage 
because of Theun-Hinhoun Power Project. On the contrary, it 
will eliminate water supply constraints in the Nam Hai area 
during the dry season and increase fish production and improve 
navigation upstream of the diversion dam. The local community 
will benefit from improved health and education facilities, 
employment opportunities and rural electrification. 
  Theun-Hinboun Power Project will bring about the greening of 
the surrounding areas in many ways, in addition to earning hard 
currency for Laos.

  [Text] Vientiane, May 26 (KPL) -- Prime Minister Khamtai 
Siphandon on May 5 signed an order concerning forest 
exploitation that all state agencies at both central and 
provincial levels have to implement strictly. 
  The order indicated weak points in the implementation of the 
party and state policy on forestry resources as well as 
instances of violating this policy. 
  According to this order, permissions for cutting timber over 
quota and for cutting timber for all building purposes which 
have not been approved by the ministry concerned and the 
government are no longer issued, and those issued previously are 
ordered cancelled immediately and absolutely. No province can 
allow private businsses and owners of saw mills and wood 
processing factories to send their people to cut timber in the 
forest by themselves. State authorities in cooperation with 
locals will organise the cutting of timber and then sell it to 
private businesses at log yards No. 1 or No. 2. Provinces have 
to stop exporting log and sawn wood, and if necessary, they need 
special permission from the government. Provinces having border 
cross points with foreign countries should help the government 
in inspections. Timber export without permission from the 
governments absolutely not allowed to pass bordr points. 
  The government has allowed some companies only to do the 
export of sawn timber. Any companies with no authorization from 
the government are definitely not allowed to do so. The import 
of timber from other countries to Laos or in transit to a third 
country also requires a quota from the government. Installations 
of mobile saw mills and wood slicing machines are no longer 
allowed in the forest. Previous permissions on the matter, if 
any, will be officially cancelled. Exchanges of timber for cars, 
materials, equipment and other construction ventures are no 
longer permitted. Provinces have no right to allow local and 
foreign investors to set up wood processing industries and to 
undertake forestry concessions. This matter is to be decided by 
the government alone. The use by foreigners of labour, drawing 
equipment and trucks for cutting timber in the forest without 
permission from the government must be stopped. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of 
Industry and Handicraft are asked to send their personnel to the 
provinces to collect data on the numbers of villages and people 
still living on slash-and-burn farming on upland and watershed 
areas and their annual demand for rice. Then the personnel have 
to discuss with provincial authorities a solution to the issue. 
In areas where conditions are favorable, people may have to move 
to fixed farming in the plainland, while those living in areas 
not favorable for rice farming will be advised to stop 
slash-and-burn farming and take up the planting of industrial 
trees or cattle raising on the spot. The state will provide them 
with rice, credit, money and animals. Slash- and-burn 
cultivation in lowland areas which cause forest destruction is 
also strictly banned.

<F P=106> [Report by Y.C. Tsai] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan will attend a 
worldwide meeting on trade, environmental protection, and global 
sustained development scheduled for June 10-11 in Geneva, an 
industrial official said Saturday [21 May]. 
  Lin Chih-sheng, a division chief in charge of industrial 
regulations at the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB), noted 
that the two-day meeting will be hosted by the secretariat of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  The world trade regulating body, which will be superseded by 
the World Trade Organization (WTO) next year, has as its top 
priority the balanced development of world trade and 
environmental protection, Lin said. 
  Major topics on the agenda include the relationship among 
free trade, environmental protection, and global sustained 
development, environmental protection costs versus trade 
policies, and the future direction of international cooperation, 
he elaborated. 
  In order to learn of the most recent developments in this 
regard, he said, Taiwan must be represented at the meeting. The 
bureau, however, has yet to decide on which delegates will 
attend the meeting, he added. 
  A Taiwan delegation, led by Vice Economic Affairs Minister 
Sheu Ke-sheng, is in Geneva this week for the fifth meeting of 
the GATT working party screening Taiwan's membership 
application. Taiwan was accepted as a GATT observer in 
September 1992 and is expected to become a full member by the 
end of this year. 
  Citing a faxed letter from IDB Deputy Director-General Ho 
Mei-liang who is among the 33-member delegation in Geneva, Lin 
said that the June 10-11 GATT meeting will be vital to future 
trade and production trends.

  [Text] The Kaohsiung city criminal police force and the 
Agriculture Council's investigative group yesterday [23 May] 
solved the largest case of illegal ivory sales in the province. 
They seized some 10,000 pieces of finished or semifinished ivory 
products whose value was initially estimated at more than 100 
million new Taiwan [NT] dollars. Here is a report by Huang 
Chien-ping: [begin recording] 
  Huang: [sentence indistinct] In the afternoon, 
the Executive Yuan's Wildlife Protection Group and the police, 
acting on the tip, went to the Hsiangyacheng herbal medicine 
shop on Chengkung First Road in Chienchin District, Kaohsiung 
city, to crack down on the illegal trade. They seized a large 
quantity of ivory, including 12 pieces of ivory that had not 
been cut, and some 10,000 pieces of ivory goods. Chang 
Yu-cheng, director of the Agriculture Council's Forestry 
Department, said: 
  Chang: In Taipei, we solved an illegal smuggling 
case involving more than 1,000 pieces of ivory. Acting on a tip 
provided by an individual, we went to Kaohsiung today and acted 
in concert with the criminal police force. 
  Huang: Chang Yu-cheng said: According to 
preliminary estimates, the ivory shipment is worth more than 
NT$100 million. The shopowner, Lin Weng-shou, argued that the 
ivory products in his shop were imported legally. The police 
are still determining whether the ivory shipment in question is 
legal, and they are investigating its source and destination. 
  This has been a report by China Broadcasting Corporation 
reporter Huang Chien-ping from Kaohsiung. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Lilian Wu] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- Wildlife breeders protested 
outside the Council of Agriculture (COA) Thursday [26 May], 
urging the council to allow them to sell the animals they have 
raised. 
  The animal breeders, with animals in tow, gathered outside 
the council to argue against wildlife protection laws which 
prohibit the sale of their animals. 
  The breeders argued that they began to raise the animals 
before the wildlife conservation act, which prohibits the trade 
and use of protected wildlife, was enacted in 1989. 
  They said they depend on the sale of their animals not only 
for themselves but also for their families. 
  Wildlife breeders have voiced their opposition to COA 
regulations on several occasions, but this is the first time 
that they have taken their animals, including a bengal tiger, 
crocodile, masked palm civets, formosa rock monkeys and formosa 
reeve's muntjacks. 
  The private owners said that all the animals were kept in 
cages and posed no danger to the public. 
  Weng Chin-huo, a tiger breeder, said that private breeders 
have done a lot to promote the conservation of wild animals. He 
complained that the conservationists have completely ignored 
their contribution to wildlife preservation. 
  COA officials said that the revised wildlife conservation 
act, which is now under deliberation in the Legislative Yuan, 
would address the issue. 
  The private owners will March to the American Institute in 
Taiwan, the unofficial U.S. Embassy in Taiwan, to protest U.S. 
trade sanctions against Taiwan for its alleged trade in rhino 
horns and tiger parts. 
  Meanwhile, private breeders of wildlife are struggling to 
deal with the large number of animals they own which are 
protected by the wildlife conservation act. 
  COA statistics showed that there are 128 registered tigers 
in 
Taiwan, of which 79 are privately owned. Most of the tiger 
breeders use bengal tigers. 
  Tiger breeder Weng said he owns seven tigers, up from two in 
1989, and does not know what to do with the now-protected 
animals. 
  COA officials said they have contacted the Trade Record 
Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce (TRAFFIC) about the 
possibility of returning the tigers to their natural habitats. 
  But the officials said that India and Thailand have refused 
the tigers after concerns about tiger attacks on humans.

  [Text] Port Vila, May 27 (AFP) -- The Vanuatu Government 
said Friday it had decided to restrict logging and ban timber 
exports to protect the environment of this island nation. 
  The Council of Ministers made its decision Thursday 
following 
a recent environmental study, acting on a recommendation by 
Prime Minister Maxime Carlot, government spokeswoman Yvette Sam 
said. 
  Sam said the decision mainly affected four companies logging 
on the southern island of Erromango with licences issued last 
year that allowed them to exceed the quotas recommended in the 
study. 
  The government decided to halve the number of logging 
companies in Erromango to two within a month and to restrict the 
volume of wood cut in Vanuatu to an annual 25,000 cubic metres 
(32,500 cubic yards), as recommended by the Australian-funded 
study. 
  It would also ban all wood exports from June 15 to encourage 
processing within Vanuatu. 
  Representatives of European Union countries told Carlot on 
May 17 of their concern about the scale of logging in Vanuatu, 
reminding him of EU funding for sustainable logging projects. 
  Carlot had promised to take action, saying excess logging 
was 
a "serious problem."

  [Text] The Mekong Delta, known as the "rice bowl" of 
Vietnam, may no longer be able to lay claim to that title if 
proposed hydropower plans affect the fertility of the region. 
  "Damming the Mekong River is like declaring a war with 
Vietnam," noted U.S. biologist Dr Tyson Roberts, who has 
observed the Mekong ecological system since the 1970s. 
  If Roberts is correct, then the first battle has already 
begun. Recently completed is the l,500-megawatt Manwan Dam, the 
first of its kind on the mainstream Lanchang Giang (Mekong 
River) in China's southern province of Yunnan. 
  The 4,200 kilometre Mekong River starts its journey from the 
Tibetan Himalayas passing through southwestern China, Burma, 
Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and then to Vietnam, where silt carried 
down the river and deposited in the area for thousands of years 
has formed a large expanse of over four million hectares of land 
at the delta. 
  River dwellers living in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia have 
noticed the unusually low water levels during the dry season 
since the dam was built. Vietnam, as the last country the 
Mekong passes before entering the sea, is no exception. 
  "We don't have any concrete or clear scientific conclusions 
about the unnatural reduction of water in the Mekong. But 
farmers at the delta have already noticed that water levels in 
the river and connecting canals are lower than they were in 
former years," said Dr Le Quang Minh, dean of the Water Resource 
and Land Improvement Faculty, Cantho University. 
  Cantho is the capital of Hau Giang Province, named after the 
largest "tail" of the "dragon". In Vietnam the Mekong River is 
known as the Nine-tailed Dragon, as the river formerly split 
into nine branches at the delta. 
  Two of the major branches are the Tien Giang and Hau Giang 
where webs of thousands of canals have been dug for navigation 
and irrigation. Giang comes from a Chinese letter meaning 
river. Today the "dragon" has only seven tails as two of them, 
Ba Ly and Co Chien, have been filled up with silt deposits. 
  Crop cultivation and sustainable ways of life in this part 
of 
the country are made possible by these tails. Over 50 per cent 
of rice harvested for local consumption and export are grown in 
the delta region. Shortly after economic liberalization in 
1986, Vietnam became the world's third largest rice exporter 
after the United States and Thailand. 
  "Engineers have quite a positive perspective about dams, but 
I do not. Even though people desire the proposed function of 
the dam, I wonder whether it will be operated as it was 
designed. The people who designed it are not the same ones as 
those who operate it," said Minh. 
  There are fears that the dam will be operated solely for the 
purpose of supplying energy without thought given to the effect 
dam operations will have on the delta region. 
  "If I were the director, and those dams were designed for 
generating electricity, I would keep this function as my 
priority when operating the dam. In the dry season, I would 
retain water to secure operation of the dam." 
  "It's the same story with the flood," the water management 
specialist continued. "If there is a big flood, I don't believe 
dam operators would retain the water because it could be risky 
for the safety of the dam." 
  Due to Vietnam's push for development and wealth, supported 
by multilateral business and financial agencies, the Vietnamese 
government strictly maintains its export-oriented policy. 
Agricultural products, especially rice, are produced for export. 
High-yield-varieties have been promoted in the delta area. 
Irrigation systems, as a result, need to be expanded and 
improved upon to catch up to the expansion of plantation areas. 
  The An Giang and Kien Giang provinces, west of the delta, as 
well as Dong Thap province in the East, are in the target areas 
of such agricultural development. However, the soil in O.55 
million hectares of the area is strongly acidic, 1.05 million 
hectares is medium and lightly acidic, 0.15 million hectares is 
permanently saline and 0.16 million has high salinity in the dry 
season. 
  The relationship between the soil, water and farming systems 
in the Mekong delta is so complicated and fragile that any 
changes in the condition of one component needs to be repeatedly 
tried and tested before the actual results of the change can be 
determined. 
  The Mekong Committee in 1992 hired the Netherlands 
Development Consultancy to plan irrigation improvement of the 
acidic areas in the Southwest of the delta. The consultant at 
that time planned to divert the water from the Hau Giang River 
to lower the acidity levels. 
  But the plan has not been implemented as detailed studies 
are 
needed to find out how much water should be wed. Too much water 
for irrigation means not enuough water at the mouth of the Hua 
Giang to maintain the natural conditions of salinity from the 
South China Sea. 
  While hydro engineers dream to tame the Mekong by 
controlling 
natural floods and drought, what never seems to be taken into 
account is the ecological implications when the natural flow is 
disrupted by huge concrete structures such as dams.

  [Text] Mochovce -- Without further expert analyses and, 
most important of all, the realization of measures, the 
depository for radioactive waste being built near the Mochovce 
nuclear power station in Levice district cannot, given its 
present state, be considered prepared to meet the task assigned 
to it. This was stated, among other things, by Douglas Champ 
from Canada, the head of a team of International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] experts, at a news conference in Mochovce 
yesterday. Since the beginning of this week, the international 
group of experts has been studying in Mochovce all important 
aspects of radioactive waste storage at the depository adjacent 
to the power station, possibilities of enhancing the 
depository's safety, requirements for control, technology, and 
professional qualifications of the maintenance staff, as well as 
the progress of finishing work. The experts reached the 
conclusion that the concept of storing radioactive waste to be 
used at Mochovce is good and that, following the implementation 
of recommended measures, storage will be reliable and safe. 
According to Douglas Champ, the recommendations will encompass 
a wide range of ideas, ranging from design, construction, 
specifications of the waste, and measurement of limits, down to 
public relations.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on environmental issues monitored through 19 May. 
<H5>  Brazil </H5>
  On 17 May, 10,000 metric tons of oil from the Madre de Deus 
terminal of the Mataripe refinery contaminated beaches in 
Salvador State and the northern coast of Bahia State. The 
Environment Resources Center hold the Brazilian Petroleum 
Corporation responsible. This is the second time the Todos os 
Santos Beach has been contaminated in 10 days. (Rio de Janeiro O 
GLOBO in Portuguese 18 May 94 p 9) 
  Lead pollution has caused the deaths of approximately 50 
head 
of cattle and horses in Pindorama, in Sao Paulo State. Analysis 
showed a high concentration of lead in the kidneys of the 
animals. The State Basin Sanitation Engineering Company has set 
late June as the deadline for the Incometal company, which is 
responsible for the pollution, to install pollution control 
equipment. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 19 May 
94 p A12) 
<H5>  Peru </H5>
  The Central Peru Mining Enterprise and the Huaron, El 
Brocal, 
and Animon mining companies are seriously contaminating the 
Junin Lake located between the Pasco and Junin Departments. 
They are dumping chemical waste and metals like zinc, copper, 
gold and silver into the lake through the San Juan and Huayllay 
Rivers. The pollution affects 80 percent of the lake which 
measures some 1,184 square kilometers. Nearly 120 species of 
birds used to populate the lake during their annual migratory 
cycle. Today not one species remains. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in 
Spanish 30 Apr 94 p 15) 
  Thousands of fish died last weekend as a result of the waste 
contaminating the beach at the residential zone of Santo Domingo 
in Pisco region. Peruvian researcher Ronald Woodman terms this 
"an ecological crime" and notes that pollution has affected this 
region for many years. He said it may endanger the Paracas 
National Reserve, near Pisco. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1924 GMT 9 
May 94) 
  The Information and Education Center for the Prevention of 
Drug Abuse has reported that coca growing expansion has caused 
the deforestation of approximately 70,000 hectares of the 
Peruvian Amazon. This represents 10 percent of all 
deforestation since it began early this century. Chemicals used 
by coca growers to process cocaine base in Huallaga are 
seriously affecting the ecosystem because large amounts of waste 
from maceration pits installed near rivers are contaminating the 
waters and exterminating many species. Approximately 37 million 
liters of kerosene, 37 million liters of sulphuric acid, 16,000 
metric tons of lime, and 16,000 metric tons of toilet paper have 
been used to process cocaine paste. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in 
Spanish 9 May 94 p 8) 
<H5>  Uruguay </H5>
  An accident in the oil refinery plant owned by the National 
Administration of Fuels, Alcohol, and Portland Cement, on 14 May 
contaminated the Montevideo beach. Approximately 400,000 liters 
of liquid asphalt spilled into the River Plate as a result of a 
fault in a tank at the La Teja plant at one end of the port of 
Montevideo. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2149 GMT 14 May 94) 
  Manuel Romay, the housing, land improvement and environment 
minister, opened a seminar in Montevideo on 16 May. The seminar 
deals with substances harmful to the ozone layer. He said that 
in face of the increasing deterioration of the ozone layer, the 
Housing, Land Improvement, and Environment Ministry will control 
the use of substances harmful to the ozone layer, including the 
creation of the "Ozone Friend" seal which will identify products 
that lack toxic substances. (Montevideo LA MANANA in Spanish 17 
May p 10)

  [Text] Santiago, 24 May (EFE) -- Chilean businessmen fear 
that the labor and environmental demands that various U.S. 
organizations want to introduce into a free trade agreement with 
Chile would leave this country out of the competition. 
  Jose Antonio Guzman, president of the Production and Trade 
Confederation, said that the demands being rejected by Chilean 
businessmen are sectoral collective negotiation and mandatory 
unionization, which have already been left behind in Chile. 
  The businessmen also reject the environmental regulations 
for 
production, which according to Guzman exceed the Chilean 
capabilities of investment, and is a requirement that is not 
even met in the United States. 
  Guzman made this comment to the local media after returning 
from the United States, where he contacted various U.S. 
organizations, including union leaders. 
  Regarding the talks he had held, Guzman said he perceived 
strong pressure to impose the labor and environmental 
regulations in the future free trade agreement to be negotiated 
between Chile and the United States. 
  In reference to the environmental demands, Guzman said: "We 
have to be very careful and alert, because a clause of 
protectionism under the disguise of protecting our interests 
could be introduced, which is logically something we will not 
accept." 
  Regarding the labor clauses, Guzman said the two suggested 
regulations have already been left behind in Chilean labor 
legislation, and that business is not willing to reincorporate 
them "because they are harmful to various labor sectors and 
consumers." 
  He added that Chilean business is willing to reach an 
agreement with the United States, but only, he added, "if it is 
beneficial for the country, and does not impose environmental or 
labor regulations that exceed Chilean capabilities and leave us 
out of the competition." 
  Guzman explained that his organization is studying the 
advantages and disadvantages of joining NAFTA, or the 
possibility of a free trade agreement with the United States. 
  Guzman said the businessmen will thoroughly study the two 
choices before issuing a declaration. 
  Chile and the United States reaffirmed their decision to 
sign 
a free trade agreement, to be defined during the negotiations.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Group of 100 and the Environmental Research 
Agency on 25 May urged the Mexican delegation, which is 
participating in the 46th Annual Conference of the International 
Whaling Commission (IWC), to avoid making changes in a French 
proposal to establish a sanctuary for this animal in Antarctica. 
  Mr. Homero Arigis, president of the Group of 100, and 
Catherine Helmsly, who heads the whale program of the 
Environmental Research Agency, said that the original plan was 
to demarcate the sanctuary at 40 degrees latitude south across 
the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. The Mexican proposal, 
however, is to demarcate it somewhere between 50 and 62 degrees 
latitude south, which would entail the reduction of thousands of 
kilometers where the capture of whales would be banned. 
  Mr. Homero Arigis said: Mexico has joined Chile, 
Switzerland, Sweden, and Monaco in supporting this proposal, 
and, in doing so, Mexico is obstructing the original French 
proposal without giving it an chance. This move was called 
divisive and contradictory to the position publicly announced 
last week by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
  The two organizations pointed out that the Mexican 
delegation 
must explain the reason for its change in position on the 
protection of whales, adding that its reply should be reflected 
in the way it votes on the sanctuary issue. 
  Mr. Homero Arigis said: In terms of protecting the sea cow, 
which is the most threatened and most common marine cetacean in 
the upper Gulf of California, this year the IWC Scientific 
Commission has estimated its total population at 316. An IWC 
delegation has proposed a resolution to protect sea cows at this 
meeting. The Mexican delegation, however, replied that Mexico 
prefers the noninclusion of this resolution on the IWC meeting's 
agenda. 
  The Group of 100 and the Environmental Research Agency ruled 
out that Mexico will sell its vote, but both groups noted Japan 
is capturing whales in Mexican seas. They recognized Japanese 
sovereignty, but asked this Asian nation to also enforce 
international sovereignty and to modify its customs, as Mexico 
did when it stopped consuming sea turtle eggs.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 25--The Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today underlined the need for a proper balance 
between development and environment, reports PTI. 
  Presiding over the first meeting of the National Environment 
Council (NEC) here, Mr Rao reiterated government's commitment to 
alleviate poverty through development but cautioned that the 
race for development should not be at the cost of damaging the 
nature. 
  The Prime Minister stressed for a proper blend of 
technological advances with the ancient wisdom to ensure that 
one could live in harmony with nature. "We must look for our own 
innovation to meet the pollution control requirements," he said, 
adding that the choice of methods should be limited to least 
pollution ones. 
  The 112-member body was constituted recently by the 
government to function as a "think-tank" on important 
environment policy matters and to advise the ministry of 
environment and forests. The Prime Minister is the chairman with 
minister for environment and forests as the vice chairman. 
  The council includes all state and Union territory ministers 
for environment, secretaries of several ministries and 
departments of Central government, heads of national 
institutions and representatives from commerce and industry, 
eminent environmentalists, journalists and activists. 
  The Prime Minister said that the role of the ministry to 
control pollution and promote balanced growth through 
environmental impact assessment should not be considered as an 
impediment in development. It should be viewed as an enabling 
one, he said. 
  Calling for greater efforts towards afforestation, he 
expressed his happiness that the scheme has started bearing 
fruits as shown by satellite imagery. 
  He recalled that the late prime minister, Ms Indira Gandhi, 
was the only head of government in 1972 to focus the world 
attention on environment which has caught the attention of the 
whole world today. 
  Saying that co-operation at international level was the only 
way for survival, the Prime Minister said the developed world 
has the technology to deal with the situation while the 
developing countries like India have the traditional ethos and 
"there the two have to supplement each other." 
  Welcoming the delegates, the minister of state for 
environment and forests, Mr Kamal Nath said the NEC has been 
constituted as the protection of environment was not the sole 
preserve of a single ministry. 
  He said it was not even within the exclusive capability of 
the government system as a whole, whether at the Centre or the 
states. 
  Mr Kamal Nath said that there is a feeling that his ministry 
should present an environment survey of the country to 
Parliament every year, parallel to the economic survey. This 
survey should project the extent of nature of the "environmental 
deficit" together with the strategy to reduce it.

  [Text] India has called for a more equitable distribution 
of the earth resources. The environment minister, Mr. Kamal 
Nath, told the UN Commission on Sustainable Development that 
there should be a change in pattern of consumption, favoring 
lesser use of energy and lesser waste. The minister was 
addressing the commission in New York yesterday. Mr. Kamal Nath 
said unless the gap between the quality of life in the 
developing world and that in the developed nations is narrowed 
down, there can be no sustainable development. Mr. Kamal Nath 
said developing countries cannot be expected to be frozen at 
some marginal level of subsistence. He said even a marginal 
reduction in consumption by rich people in advanced countries 
could make a large number of poor people better off without 
affecting the rich. He welcomed the beginning made with the 
Global Environment Facility, the GEF, but cautioned that the 
gains of the GEF will be overwhelmed if they are not followed 
expeditiously.

  [Text] Thatta, May 11 -- Massive tree-felling has been 
occuring in the district which can be gauged from the fact that 
some 200 trucks loaded with wood reach Karachi from here 
everyday. 
  While the rest of the world is striving to combat pollution 
and arrest environmental degradation, rapid destruction of 
forests in Thatta district is posing a serious threat to the 
environment and the picturesque landscape. 
  According to official data, Babool seed broadcasting has 
been 
carried out on 10,569 acres from 1990 till now as against that, 
12,000 acres have been denuded by illegal tree-felling during 
the same period. 
  Sources in the forest department claim that the department 
earned Rs [rupees] 8.6 million by selling wood only during 
1992-93, whereas a large quantity of wood was given to the 
favourites of some influential persons, free of cost. Some 3,569 
acres of forest land were leased out to abadgars for 
cultivation, the sources added. 
  Out of 36 small and big forests spread over 138,000 acres in 
Thatta district, nine riverine and inland irrigated forests on 
8,900 hectares have been selected and Babool seed broadcasting 
has been carried out with the assistance of the Asian 
Development Bank. The bank has allocated Rs 1144 million for 
afforestation in Sindh. The scheme will take seven years to 
materialise. 
  Enumerating reasons for the deforestation, the sources said 
that since the operation of the Ghulam Mohammad Barrage (Sukkur 
Barrage) in 1957 and its four major canals -- Phuleli, Pinyari, 
Channel and K.B. Feeder -- on the Right Bank of the Indus, water 
has been diverted to irrigated areas which resulted in short 
water supply to forests and caused their destruction.

  [Text] At the United Nations, Pakistan has proposed that 
resources from the public sector, especially from industrially 
developed countries, should be transferred to developing nations 
for environmental protection so the process of sustainable 
development can be continued. Addressing the high-level meeting 
of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development, Begum Nusrat 
Bhutto, the prime minister's special envoy, proposed that 
resources should be allocated for creating awareness among the 
people about programs which can help protect the environment and 
eradicate poverty. She said that Pakistan believes in the 
process of sustainable development and like other countries is 
also deeply concerned over the deteriorating natural 
environment. She said that Pakistan feels concrete steps should 
be taken at global and national levels for continued 
development. Begum Nusrat Bhutto said that the Government of 
Pakistan is aware of the importance of environmental protection 
and the matter always remains in view while making decisions at 
every level.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- "The now existing inter- 
governmental agreements on the processing of radioactive wastes 
on Russian territory may be revised. In any case, the 
Inter-departmental Commission for Ecological Safety of the 
Russian Security Council has moved to include without fail an 
article in those documents, laying down that the processed 
wastes should be returned to the countries from where they had 
arrived," Chairman of the Commission Aleksey Yablokov stated 
here today. 
  There are several legislative acts in Russia today, 
regulating the processing of foreign radioactive wastes on its 
territory. For instance, the law on the protection of the 
environment prohibits the import and storage of such wastes on 
Russian territory. However, Russia's inter-governmental 
agreements with Finland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and the 
former German Democratic Republic stipulate that wastes from 
nuclear power plants, built in those countries with the 
participation of the USSR, should be processed in Russia. No 
such document was signed with Hungary. Yablokov said that 
Russia could, in principle, continue the job of processing 
radioactive wastes, but only at the request of foreign states, 
on a commercial basis, and with their obligatory "repatriation". 
  There is a special plant at Chelyabinsk-45, but it is able 
to 
process wastes only from nuclear-propelled submarines and 
VVER-type reactors. The construction of the Krasnoyarsk-26 
plant, designed to process wastes from RBMK (Chernobyl-type) 
reactors, has still not been completed. More than two trillion 
roubles are needed to finish the project. Yablokov said that 
the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy was planning to meet a 
part of this sum by concluding an agreement with Hungary. 
However, the money that it will get from this is obviously not 
enough, the specialist said. 
  Yablokov also believes that "it is high time to revise the 
closed nuclear cycle concept", used until now. According to 
this system, enriched uranium and plutonium from nuclear power 
plants were used to make nuclear warheads. But since they are 
no longer needed, radioactive materials could "simply be kept 
for several tens of years" in special storages. They would lose 
much of their radioactivity by the end of that period and could 
be safely buried.

<F P=106> [Interview with M. Ya. Lemeshev, chairman of the </F>
Environmental Committee of the State Duma of the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly, by V. Mikhaylov; place and date not 
given: "Health of the People Is of Paramount Importance"] 
  [Text] 
  Mikhaylov: Mikhail Yakovlevich, first of all I 
would like to congratulate you with assumption of your new post 
and your selection as chairman of the State Duma Environmental 
Committee. Even though many currently believe that environmental 
issues are not of the greatest importance in today's life, that 
there certainly are more important matters. Do you agree with 
that? 
  Lemeshev: I am firmly convinced that revival of 
Russia and of the Russian people, which is talked about by one 
and all today, is impossible without resolution of ecological 
problems. This is determined by the fact that in itself the 
ecological situation in the country is simply catastrophic, 
which is understood by all and which requires no explanation. 
Today, in fact, we are talking about survival. Look at the 
demographic aspect. There exists an absolutely despondent 
situation--in essence ethnic Russians are dying out. Scientific 
research conducted by authoritative scientists, including 
American and Japanese scientists, indicates that now 40 percent 
of the children are born already sick. What will happen to them 
in adult life? Two-thirds of all the diseases today are 
associated with the unfavorable state of the environment. In 
Russia this is more pronounced than in the West. 
  First of all pollution of the environment in cities with 
populations of over one million is alarming. Water quality 
there, as a rule, is poor (it is generally poor everywhere in 
our country), food contains pesticides, nitrites, and various 
biological additives. At the same time, what is of interest is 
that this applies not so much to domestically produced goods as 
to those that are imported. Advertising, propaganda, and 
attractive packaging, and we are still susceptible to all of 
that, do their job. Developed countries frequently sell us 
whatever is not in demand at home. By the way, many of the 
western countries have rigid environmental protection laws. 
  In my opinion we must concentrate specifically on improving 
the health of our people. That is a priority task. Yes, 
biodiversity, problems of protected territories--that is 
important, that is good, but the most important factor is the 
health of the people. 
  Mikhaylov: But all this requires money and, I am 
assuming, quite a lot of it. Where is it coming from? At whose 
expense? There is so much talk about the poverty of the state 
treasury and the incredible deficit of the state budget. You, as 
a member of the State Duma, must take into account the 
conditions of our reality. Is all that you talk about so 
convincingly realistic from the financial viewpoint? 
  Lemeshev: As an economist, I am quite distrubed by 
the currently widespread view that since the economy is in a 
state of crisis, it is impossible to deal with environmental 
problems in the given period. After it improves, then we will 
concern ourselves with ecology to the fullest extent. What is 
most lamentable is that this, in my opinion, harmful concept is 
finding a response among the people. That is understandable: the 
people are barely surviving and, as it is said, never mind the 
butter when survival is at stake. That is basically wrong. 
Without the resolution of environmental problems we will never 
improve the economy--that is my profound conviction. 
  Here is a vivid example. Under conditions involving 
environmental pollution people become ill more seriously and 
frequently which, in turn, affects the efficiency of production. 
Does that affect the national economy or not? Colossal sums are 
needed for treatment, purchase of medications and building of 
hospitals--doesn't that place a burden on the economy? Only 
totally myopic people are failing to see this. 
  All right, let us take the production of fabrics as an 
example. Not just water but pure water is needed in order for 
the fabric to be of good quality. Would it not be cheaper to 
avoid polluting the water to start with rather than spend huge 
amounts of money later on its purification? Understand that it 
is impossible to separate economy and ecology--it is a single 
metasystem. I would like to mention something else: there are no 
ecological problems of one or another country and the resolution 
of ecological problems is impossible within the framework of a 
single country. Let us say, the Scandinavian countries have made 
considerable progress in the resolution of environmental 
problems, but 90 percent of the environmental pollutants come to 
them from other countries. 
  Mikhaylov: That is only a general overview of the 
task. In your opinion how and with what practical steps should 
your committee start its work? Which draft laws do you believe 
are of primary importance in the sphere of environmental 
protection? 
  Lemeshev: I do not want to start complaining about 
the lack of facilities right off but at present 15 deputies and 
as many office workers have only two small rooms, there are no 
typewriters, computers, or technical means and equipment for 
accounting, planning, and analysis of operations. I do not know 
how we will be able to work. 
  As far as legislative work of the committee is concerned I 
believe that preparation of a draft law on ecological disaster 
zones is a matter of overriding importance. True, it is today 
possible to designate all of Russia as an ecological disaster 
zone, but there are some areas that are worse off such as, for 
instance, the Chernobyl disaster zone, regions with a 
concentration of chemical and petrochemical production and 
places where hydrocarbon raw materials are extracted in the 
northern part of Russia which constitutes a severe blow to areas 
inhabited by minority people. A law dealing with ecological 
studies by experts, not at the agency level as it is now, but at 
the federal state level, with widespread participation of the 
public, is highly necessary. Only then will we be able to bar 
projects which destroy nature and man himself. 
  Is legislation on drinking water not important, is it not 
necessary to create supplements to the Criminal Code dealing 
with responsibility for ecological crimes? So there is a whole 
lot of work to be done. 
  Mikhaylov: Mikhail Yakovlevich, looking through 
the list of the members of your committee I noticed its 
considerable diversity: it includes members from the Russian 
Choice, communists, DPR [Democratic Party of Russia] members, 
and you yourself represent the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia]. Does it seem to you that such political discord can 
interfere with the normal lawmaking acctivities of the 
committee? Moreover it is necessary to establish constructive 
relations with the Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources. 
  Lemeshev: As far as the latter is concerned I feel 
rather optimistically inasmuch as the minister himself, Viktor 
Ivanovich Danilov-Danilyan, is a member of our committee and, at 
least for the present, we have a mutual understanding with 
respect to all of the issues. Even though I am familiar by 
hearsay with an impartial polemic between Danilov-Danilyan and 
Aleksey Vladimirovich Yablokov, chairman of the Russian 
Federation Interagency Commission on Environmental Safety, which 
developed on the pages of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, I feel 
uncomfortable when disputes develop between such highly 
respected people. It is simply the scourge of our Russian 
intelligentsia. We must reject agency, political, and 
professional ambitions where the common good is concerned. We 
must alter our psychology. I view the work of our committee with 
hope because I feel convinced that the task concerning 
preservation of the environment is capable of unifying people 
with highly divergent political views.

  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Liquid radioactive waste 
products of the "Zvezda" works in Primorye maritime region will 
be dropped into the Pacific Ocean, unless urgent measures are 
taken to collect, preserve and process them, the press centre of 
the Russian Ministry for Emergencies announced on Thursday. 
  In expert opinion, the situation at the works is 
controllable 
so far, but in three months all the available tanks for 
collecting the waste products will have been filled to capacity. 
  The Russian Government instructed the ministries and 
departments concerned to suggest possible wayouts. The Ministry 
for Emergencies, the Ministry for Nuclear Industry, the Ministry 
of Public Health and naval forces proposed several ways to solve 
the problem, but they cannot be realised for lack of funding.

  [Text] Moscow, 19 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin today sent greetings to the organizers of the 
All-Russia Days of Protection Against Ecological Danger. The 
text of the message has been issued by the president's press 
service: 
  "To the organizers of, and participants in, the All-Russia 
Days of Protection against Ecological Danger; 
  The All-Russia Days of Protection Against Ecological Danger 
are taking place in our country for the first time, from 15 
April to 5 June 1994. I wholeheartedly welcome the initiative 
to stage them. 
  I regard the action as timely and necessary. 
  Protection of the natural environment is one of the Russian 
state's priority tasks. To ensure ecological safety, the 
government is drawing up a long-term state strategy that 
envisages widespread use of the vast potential of Russia's 
military-industrial complex. I think it will also be useful to 
have special ecological subunits within the Russian Army that 
will be able not only to eliminate the serious ecological 
consequences of their activities, but also to clean up 
industrially polluted areas, especially in ecological disaster 
zones. 
  It is our common duty to combine our efforts and do 
everything possible to see that our towns and villages are 
green, and that the air, land, and water at our places of work, 
in our enterprises, around our own homes and throughout our 
motherland are pure. Russia needs a program of ecological 
regeneration. Such a program can only be drawn up by the whole 
of society--the government, parliament, entrepreneurs, parties, 
scientists, and public ecological organizations. I support the 
idea of convening an all-Russia congress on ecology and 
environmental protection to adopt such a program. 
  Having inherited our native natural conditions from our 
ancestors, we, the people of Russia, are obliged to bequeath 
them to our children and grandchildren in all their original 
beauty. I sincerely hope that the All-Russia Days of Protection 
Against Ecological Danger will help us all to recognize the 
importance and responsibility of this task. 
  I wish you success, dear friends, in the noble cause of 
preserving Russia's natural environment. 
  [signed] B. Yeltsin."

<F P=106> [V. Voropayev report over video; from the "Dalniy Vostok" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Representatives of the Pacific Fleet consider the 
concern of domestic and foreign nature conservationists about 
the problem of liquid radioactive waste in the Maritime Kray 
unfounded. [Video shows archive footage of nuclear submarines 
being dismantled, tankers at wharf] Valeriy Danilyan, chief of 
the fleet service of radioactive and chemical defense, related 
at a meeting with Greenpeace movement activists that the 
radioactivity of this waste was so low -- 0.07 to 0.08 curie -- 
that it could be compared to the background radiation of the Sea 
of Japan, and did not endanger it in any way. Furthermore, the 
economic expenses of constructing an unnecessary, in principle, 
complex for processing the waste promise to be very substantial. 
However, international experts do not share such a complacent 
attitude, and believe that both Russia and Japan, which 
volunteered to help it, procrastinate in an unforgivable manner 
in solving the problem of utilization of nuclear waste in the 
Maritime Kray.

"Deputy Prime Minister Zaveryukha's Opinion: No Improvement"] 
  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha, 
whose duties in the Russian Federation government Include 
environmental protection oversight, noted that despite the 
stoppage of many hazardous enterprises in industry, the 
ecological situation in the country has not improved and still 
leaves a lot to be desired. 
  According to data of the Rosgidromet [Russian Federal 
Service 
on Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control] Main Geophysical 
Observatory, the air basin over a considerable number of cities 
(observations were made in 247 Russian cities) remains 
unhealthy. In the 44 cities with the most polluted air basin 
(the so-called priority list), it increased considerably between 
1988 and 1992. Pollution by certain ingredients increased 
somewhat in 15 cities. Only in 18 cities has it practically not 
changed or declined slightly because of the drop in production. 
For instance, in Irkutsk, Krasnodar, and Saratov the average 
concentration of formaldehyde increased severalfold and exceeded 
the MAC [maximum allowable concentration] by a factor of six to 
seven. In Kemerovo the average concentration of carbon bisulfide 
reached six MAC (a sixfold increase); in Krasnodar the 
concentration of phenol in the air increased from two to three 
MAC. The nitrogen oxide, dust, and phenol concentration 
increased in Lipetsk (to 1.5-2.9 MAC); nitrogen dioxide and 
ammonia concentration in Saratov--to 2.0-2.9 MAC; and in 
Cherepovets the concentration of carbon bisulfide increased from 
3.2 to five MAC in Bratsk and from 2.4 to 3.8 MAC. The degree of 
air pollution in the capital remains very high; the 
concentration of phenol did decrease, but at the same time there 
was an increase in the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (mainly 
because of increased automotive traffic). 
  The hygienic state of air basins over the cities on the 
priority list has changed to a different extent over the past 
five years. For instance, the concentration of ammonia, 
formaldehyde, and nitrogen oxides increased in St. Petersburg; 
of carbon oxide, formaldehyde, and carbon bisulfide--in Barnaul; 
of carbon oxide, formaldehyde, and carbon bisulfide--in 
Orenburg; of phenol and nitrogen oxides--in Ryazan; and of 
phenol, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides--in Kazan. The air quality 
has not changed perceptibly in Perm, Kaliningrad, Groznyy. 
Samara, Ivanovo, and Vyatka. 
  Water reservoirs. Observations of dry land surface water 
pollution are conducted at 1,341 reservoirs in 2,624 ranges. At 
851 of these ranges (32 percent) the average annual 
concentration of at least one pollutant exceeds the MAC by a 
factor of 10 or more. This ratio has not changed perceptibly 
over the past few years. 
  According to official data, in 1992 as compared to the 
preceding year in water reservoirs with a high degree of 
pollution the quality of water improved at 35 ranges, 
deteriorated at 99 ranges, and remained basically unchanged at 
717 ranges. 
  Overall, the level of pollution of water reservoirs on the 
territory of Russia remains high. 
  There has been a serious deterioration in the water quality 
in the largest Siberian rivers--the Ob, Irtysh, Vakh, Taz, and 
their numerous tributaries, where the concentration of petroleum 
products increased from five-10 MAC in the early 1980's to 10-60 
MAC in the early 1990's, and of phenols--from three-eight to 
10-45 MAC, respectively. This is a result of the low efficiency 
of environmental protection measures of oil- and gas-producing 
enterprises and river transport. 
  The level of pollution of Volga water reservoirs remains 
high--the content of many pollutants in them, including 
petroleum products, phenol, copper, and nitrogen nitrite 
measures five-15 MAC. The eutrophication process there continues 
to progress at a faster rate. 
  There has been a substantial deterioration in the condition 
of rivers in Tula Oblast, where in the upper reaches of the Don, 
Shatskiy reservoir, and Ula river the concentration of phenol 
and nitrogen compounds increased from two-eight to 20-35 MAC--a 
result of operations of Novomoskovsk industrial complex chemical 
enterprises; the situation also deteriorated in Stavropol Kray 
rivers. Here, because of the unsatisfactory work of city 
purification systems the concentration of petroleum products 
increased from four-five to 20-50 MAC; of suspended 
particles--from 150 to 950 mg per liter, and of organic 
substances--from 50 to 100-300 mgO2 per liter. 
  Over the past four years the Moscow river has unfailingly 
made it to the priority list of the most polluted water 
reservoirs in the country; the average annual content of phenol 
and nitrogen compounds in it measures 10-15 MAC, with a trend 
toward an increasing level of pollution. 
  Monitoring data on dry land surface waters for 1992 showed 
practically no change in the trends of pollution levels at water 
reservoirs in Russia: the Kola Peninsula rivers, the Oka and Ob 
basins, and rivers in the Urals industrial region remain the 
most polluted water reservoirs. 
  The results of the 1993 monitoring are currently being 
processed; the work will be finished in February.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Karasev, secretary of the </F>
Interdepartmental Committee for Ecological Safety, under the 
"Ecology" rubric in the "Prescription" section: "We Drink Dirty 
Water...But There Are Sufficient Reserves of Clean Water for the 
Whole Planet" -- words between slantlines are printed in 
boldface] 
  [Text] Groundwaters [podzemnyye vody] need no lengthy 
explanation. They are above all a source for the population's 
domestic and drinking water supply. In addition, mineral 
medicinal and table waters are used for balneological purposes, 
high-temperature (thermal) waters for thermal energy needs, and 
mineral-rich natural leachates for the extraction of minerals: 
iodine, bromine, lithium, and so forth. Groundwaters, 
especially those in the aquiferous strata nearest the surface, 
in many ways determine the ecological state of landscapes, that 
is, they determine directly how favorable conditions are for the 
functioning of the human organism. 
  Because groundwaters are better protected from pollution 
(than surface waters), they are used on a massive scale in many 
countries of the world to satisfy the population's drinking 
water requirements. In the United States groundwaters are the 
source for 75 percent of communal water supply systems; they 
satisfy the requirements for potable water of around half of the 
country's population. Groundwaters play a great role in the 
water supplies of Germany, Australia, China, and other countries. 
  Unfortunately, the use of groundwaters for drinking water in 
the Russian Federation, lags way behind former USSR and other 
countries. The list of cities in which surface waters are the 
only source of domestic and drinking water supply includes such 
metropolises as Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, 
Yekaterinburg, Omsk, Rostov-na-Donu, Vladivostok, and many 
others. But since surface waters are essentially not protected 
against possible pollution, the population of these cities is 
constantly threatened with the drinking-water supply being cut 
off. 
  At the same time the use of groundwaters, reliably protected 
from pollution as they are, is of great strategic significance, 
since they are the only drinking-water source during emergency 
situations, as is convincingly demonstrated by what happened in 
Kiev and a number of other population centers when the surface 
water supplies were shut down as a result of the Chernobyl 
catastrophe. 
  Deep below the Russian Federation there are significant 
potential reserves of fresh [presnaya] groundwater, estimated at 
more than 300 cubic kilometers per year. /This quantity of 
fresh water is sufficient to supply the entire population of the 
planet with drinking water./ Reserves of groundwater that have 
been prospected and are ready for use, including some that have 
been adapted for industrial use, exceed the reserves that are 
currently tapped. Why is this? The small degree of 
exploitation is partially to be explained by the fact that 
reserves in many deposits have been prospected to satisfy needs 
in the years 1995-2000. However, the main reasons are 
inadequate financing, poor material and technical support, and 
the incorrect strategic policy carried out by water resources 
organizations. This results in a situation in many regions, 
where because of the insufficient use of groundwaters to meet 
the demands for drinking water, there is effectively an 
ecological risk to the population, forced as it is to use 
surface waters, which are unprotected against direct pollution. 
  Thus, the chief merit of groundwaters is their higher degree 
of protection in comparison to surface waters. Therefore, in 
natural conditions, as a rule, fresh [presnyye] groundwaters 
meet the regulation requirements for drinking water. However, 
in terms of the degree of protection against pollution, a 
distiction is made between groundwaters in aquiferous substrata 
nearest the surface, which are mostly insufficiently protected 
against pollution, especially in river valleys, and artesian 
waters from deep aquifers, which are mostly reliably protected 
against pollution. 
  Despite the higher degree of protection, cases are not 
infrequent where fresh groundwaters contain this or that 
component in concentrations which do not satisfy existing 
standards. You can single out a number of hydrogeochemical 
provinces on the territory of the Russian Federation which are 
characterized by the drinking-water's high content of components 
that are subject to restrictions. Such elements include 
fluorine, iron, manganese, strontium, selenium, arsenic, and 
beryllium. 
  But a high content of components subject to restriction is 
not an obstacle to the use of such waters, since the water 
quality can be brought up to the required standards through the 
use of various water treatment methods (defluorination or 
fluorination, deferrization, and so forth). Because of the 
stability of this content, the water treatment of groundwater 
supplies is cheaper than the purification of polluted surface 
waters. 
  Undoubtedly more dangerous is the human pollution of 
groundwaters linked to various forms of economic activities, 
since such pollution is characterized by the exceptional 
diversity of the pollutants; moreover, for some of them 
virtually no purification methods have been developed. 
Long-term and ecologically dangerous sources of pollution 
include sewage settlement tanks and the solid waste from 
industrial and municipal enterprises, livestock complexes, 
mineral fertilizer and toxic chemical depots, oil storage 
facilities, fields irrigated by sewage waters, and other 
facilities. In the period 1985-1992 pollution was recorded in 
280 drinking-water supplies situated in 60 Russian cities and 
settlements. 
  In Samara and Penza Oblasts 55 water intakes with signs of 
pollution of the groundwaters have been discovered. In 
individual water-intake boreholes in the Tolyatti region, 
groundwater polluted by benzene, phenols, petroleum products, 
formaldehyde, titanium, methanol, sulfanol [as transliterated], 
and aluminum have been discovered. In many population centers 
pollution is linked with the effect of technological operations 
at industrial, municipal, and agricultural facilities. Four 
boreholes with nickel levels in excess of the maximum 
permissible concentration [MPC] have been recorded in the region 
of the Monchegorsk Combine. 
  On the territory of Novyy Urengoy, industrial facilities and 
a development site were found to be situated within the second 
and third bands of the health protection zone of the city's 
water supply intake. On the territory of Saratov Oblast 
pollution of artesian waters has been recorded in sectors of 
existing water intakes. In 13 sectors nitrogen-containing 
compounds (livestock-raising complexes), ammonia gas and 
polymetals (areas where there are ponds and municipal and 
industrial waste settlement tanks), toxic chemicals and nitrates 
(in areas with irrigation systems), petroleum products (around 
bulk plants), and chlorides and sulphates (in water-intake 
areas) have been detected in groundwaters. In certain cities 
and population centers the deterioration in the quality of 
groundwaters is a result of substandard water being drawn in 
under conditions of a violation of the recommended regulations 
for operating water intakes (as in Tomsk, and population centers 
in Arkhangelsk, Smolensk, Samara, Chita, and other oblasts). 
  The hazard to human health posed by polluted groundwaters is 
linked first and foremost to water-intake sectors which are 
being utilized for drinking water. As a rule, this is for the 
moment localized pollution but the detected quantities of 
pollutants components and the makeup of the pollution are 
extremely serious. The following contents of groundwaters used 
as drinking-water supplies have been established: nitrogen -- 
up to 40-70 times the MPC (Maritime Kray, Samara Oblast); iron 
-- up to 35-40 times the MPC (Novosibirsk and Penza Oblasts); 
sulfates and chlorides -- up to 3-5 times the MPC (Novosibirsk, 
Orel, and Tula Oblasts); phenols and petroleum products -- up to 
5-7 times the MPC (Komi Republic, North Ossetia, Orel, Samara, 
and Saratov Oblasts); strontium and aluminum up to 5-6 times the 
MPC (Arkhangelsk, Smolensk, Kirov, and Rostov Oblasts, and 
Maritime Kray). 
  In some water intakes the presence in groundwaters of silica 
(Valday and Yekaterinburg), lead (Komsomolsk-na-Amure), and 
selenium (Upper Pyshma) is being noted in quantities exceeding 
the MPC. 
  Unfortunately, we must also talk about the ecological risk 
caused by polluted groundwaters from the angle of water 
conservation activity. In the majority of cases this is being 
carried out unsatisfactorily. The rules for the operation of 
water intakes are most frequently being violated. For example, 
in Sakhalin Oblast this was noted at all of the 92 water intakes 
that were investigated: At 14 of these there were signs of 
chemical pollution oringinating from technological activity. 
Some 201 potential sources of pollution of groundwaters were 
brought to light. 
  As an example one may also cite the pollution of 
groundwaters 
at eight existing water intakes in Nizhnyy Novgorod Oblast. The 
Teplovskiy water intake which is still under construction 
is...under threat of pollution. Effluent settlement tanks at 
enterprises of the chemical industry are the source. The area 
of pollution has reached 100 square kilometers. Groundwaters 
contain sulfates, phenols, organic nitrogenous compounds, 
cyanides, and benzene -- all in quantities that considerably 
exceed the MPC. 
  In connection with the obvious threat of an ecological risk, 
certain water intakes are being switched from drinking water 
supply purposes to industrial water supply purposes. 
  The water intake at Prigorodnyy settlement near Kemerovo is 
a 
case in point. 
  Taking Russia as a whole, according to statistics provided 
by 
experts, about 1.5 million cubic meters per day (five-six 
percent) of polluted groundwaters are used for domestic and 
drinking water supplies. 
  Groundwaters are not only becoming polluted in the vicinity 
of the water intakes, but also in areas where they are not being 
exploited, which is also very undesirable as polluted 
groundwaters can get into the surface-water runoff and bodies of 
open water which is particularly dangerous for small rivers. In 
certain cases, where the groundwaters [gruntovyye vody] do not 
lie deep, atmospheric conditions and the condition of the soil 
and vegetation may become impaired owing to evaporation from 
their level, and there may be a risk of fire (when the 
groundwaters are polluted with petroleum products). 
Characteristics of the groundwaters' pollution are given below. 
  More than 1,200 areas of polluted groundwaters have been 
brought to light on Russian territory. But this figure does 
not, it seems, reflect the full picture because by no means all 
sources of pollution have been checked and investigated. At 
present, the most reliable information is available on 946 
polluted areas, of which 75 percent are situated in the European 
part of Russia. The table details the structure of the 
pollution according to the type of economic activity.

  From the point of view of the degree of danger they present 
to the human organism (toxicity) and severity of the likely 
ecological threat, the pollutants detected in groundwaters are 
divided into: 
  a) extremely dangerous substances (mercury, beryllium, 
phosphorus, carbon tetrachloride). These have been detected on 
the territories of Volgograd, Voronezh, Samara, Novosibirsk, and 
Irkutsk Oblasts, as well as on Sakhalin) -- in all 15 areas); 
  b) highly dangerous substances (lead, cadmium, fluorine, 
bromine, arsenic, etc.) These have been detected in the 
groundwaters of the majority of Federation components situated 
in the European part of Russia, the southern part of Western and 
Eastern Siberia, in the Far East, and Kamchatka -- some 217 
areas; 
  c) dangerous and moderately dangerous substances (nitrates, 
ammonia, iron, zinc, benzenes, petroleum products, pesticides 
etc.) Some 714 groundwater areas, analyzed for these 
constituents, have been found in the Central Regions, on the 
territory of Kalmykia and Chechnya, in Tyumen Oblast, the 
Transbaykal Region, and Khabarovsk Kray. 
  The prolonged consumption of drinking water which does not 
conform to hygiene standards as regards its chemical 
composition, causes people to contract various illnesses. 
  For example, according to statistics from the State 
Committee 
for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision 
[Goskomsanepidnadzor], more than one third of water pipelines 
periodically or continuously provide drinking water with an 
increased iron content, whose concentration in a number of cases 
is 5-10 times the permitted hygienic level. Apart from its 
unacceptability from the point of view of public and domestic 
sanitation, using such water constitutes a health hazard due to 
the increased risk of people contracting allergenic illnesses 
and conditions. 
  About five percent of the population consume mineral-rich 
drinking water from artesian wells which is harder than average 
and containing various salts (chlorides and sulfates), which is 
causing an increase in the incidence of illnesses of the 
gastrointestinal tract, kidney stones, renal disease and 
diseases of the cardiovascular system, is encouraging the onset 
of arterial sclerosis and hypertonia, and is having an effect on 
women's reproductive functions. 
  A study of the sickness rate and medical checkups on the 
population in Saratov Oblast, have shown that when waters of the 
type containing hydrocarbonates and possessing increased 
alkalinity are consumed for long periods, they depress the 
stomach's secretory function, encouraging the onset of a 
prehypertonic state in people and increasing the incidence of 
chronic types of hypoacidic gastritis. 
  An increase in the concentration of copper in drinking water 
causes damage to the kidneys' and liver's mucous membranes; 
increased nickel causes damage to the skin; increased zinc 
causes kidney damage; and increased arsenic causes damage to the 
central nervous system. In Lipetsk's drinking water there are 
increased concentrations of nitrates which are capable of 
suppressing the body's hemogenic function. 
  An increase in the number of cases of chronic types of 
nephritis and hepatitis, an increase in still births, toxoses 
during pregnancy, and congenital developmental abnormalties 
among the population of Kemerovo and Yurga are linked to the 
consumption of drinking water polluted with nitrogen-containing 
and organochlorine compounds, and the consumption of water with 
a high boron and bromine content has led to an increased 
incidence of illnesses of the digestive organs in children in 
Shadrinsk, Kurgan Oblast. In the settlement of Malaya Vishera 
(Novgorod Oblast) water containing more than five times the 
permitted level of aluminum has affected the central nervous and 
immune systems in children. 
  Insufficient intake of fluorine into the organism makes 
dental enamel more prone to dissolve causing damage to the teeth 
through caries. At present, owing to the low fluorine content 
in drinking water, about 60 percent of the Russian Federation's 
population is not receiving sufficient quantities of this 
microelement. In connection with this, the number of people 
suffering from caries remains at a high level and is showing no 
signs of falling. On the other hand, a high fluorine level in 
the water causes people to contract fluorosis, polyneuritis, 
osteosclerotic changes in the bones, and arterial hypertonia. 
  It has been established that a heightened manganese content 
results in the development of anemia and disrupts the 
functioning of the central nervous system; a low level of 
manganese leads to a reduction in growth rate and a breakdown of 
lipid metabolism. A heightened level of strontium causes the 
demineralization of bones, retards the closure of infants' 
fontanels, and causes "strontium" rickets. Heightened levels of 
cadmium in drinking water result in the development of Itay-Itay 
[name as transliterated] disease, malignant tumors, higher 
levels of still births, bone damage, kidney damage, congenital 
disorders, and pregnancy and labor complications. 
  Assessing the quality of groundwater as a whole, it can be 
noted that pollution is local (point-source) in nature and, in 
the majority of cases, is restricted to the parameters of the 
pollution source. It is usually the inadequately protected 
aquifers immediately beneath the surface that are polluted. 
Major centralized water intakes that generally use artesian 
aquifers supply good-quality water to the population; pollution 
is recorded in very rare cases and is connected with 
unsatisfactory water protection activity -- including 
poor-quality water intake borehole design. 
  As has been said, negative changes in the state of 
groundwater are brought about by man-made factors and often have 
critical environmental consequences. Modern warnings about such 
phenomena are possible if the laws of the flow of natural 
processes are taken into account, and if norms are laid down for 
economic activity in the utilization of natural resources. 
Obtaining the necessary information to resolve these tasks has 
required the creation of a standing service to regularly study 
the dynamics and to assess and predict the state of groundwater 
-- in other words, a service to monitor groundwater as one of 
the most important components in the monitoring of the 
geological environment and of the environment as a whole. The 
service's tasks include the functions of informing the organs 
administering the subsoil resources fund and the utilization of 
nature as a whole, as well as the population, about the state of 
groundwater, along with the functions of issuing recommendations 
to prevent or reduce and overcome negative consequences and 
economic damage which could be brought about by any particular 
condition of the groundwaters. 
  Its condition is formed under the influence of groundwater 
[as published], vegetation, atmospheric and climatic factors, 
just as groundwater largely determines the condition of the 
continguous natural environments. This requires systematic 
interdisciplinary exchange of information and the comprehensive 
processing of that data on the basis of the state regulations 
governing information flows (the state military land survey, 
land monitoring, the unified state system of environmental 
monitoring, and so forth). Given these circumstances, and in 
connection with the very important role played by groundwater 
for drinking water supply and in the shaping of other conditions 
for people's vital activity, the monitoring of the geological 
environment and a most important aspect of it -- ground water -- 
should have the status of a state system, and the monitoring 
system should receive reliable state and municipal support. 
  One of the reasons for the unsatisfactory state of drinking 
water supply as a whole and of the utilization and protection of 
groundwater in particular is the lack of the necessary 
legislative base and, as a result, the lack of any payment for 
the utilization of water resources. The Russian Federation 
Water Code and the Russian Federation Law on the Supply of 
Drinking Water to the Population have still not been ratified, 
and a Law on the Protection of Groundwater has not been 
elaborated. 
  An analysis of the state of ground waters permits the 
following assessment of the prospects of their use for domestic 
and drinking water supplies. 
  /The long-term requirement for domestic and drinking water 
supplies can be met in full (by more than 90 percent) by means 
of ground waters in 62 components of the Federation -- Bashkiria 
[Bashkortostan], Buryatia, Mordvinia, Chuvashia, Altay Kray, 
Krasnoyarsk Kray, and Amur, Bryansk, Vladimir, Voronezh, Pskov, 
Ryazan, and other oblasts/; be partially met (by 25-90 percent) 
in 15 components of the Federation -- Dagestan, Udmurtia, 
Stavropol Kray, Khabarovsk Kray, and Volgograd, Ivanovo, 
Kemerovo, Kostroma, Chelyabinsk, and other oblasts; and be 
inadequately met in six components of the Federation -- 
Kalmykia, Karelia, and Astrakhan, Kurgan, Murmansk, and 
Yaroslavl Oblasts. 
  As already pointed out, large cities are characterized by 
the 
most complex conditions for providing the population with fresh 
ground waters. From this aspect all cities with a population in 
excess of 250,000 may be divided into four groups. 
  The first includes cities provided with explored reserves of 
ground waters, some of which relate to aquifers reliably 
protected against pollution. This group includes both cities 
whose domestic and drinking water supply is entirely or 
primarily based on surface waters (Arkhangelsk, Ivanovo, Nizhniy 
Novgorod, Kirov, Makhachkala, Vladivostok) and cities whose 
present water supply is provided entirely or to a considerable 
degree by ground waters (Tver, Smolensk, Tambov, Krasnodar, 
Nalchik, Barnaul, and others). 
  The second group can include cities whose requirements are 
also fully met by ground waters, but the currently exploited or 
explored aquifers are insufficiently reliably protected against 
pollution. These are Tolyatti, Saratov, Sochi, Orenburg, Ufa, 
Krasnoyarsk, Angarsk, Bratsk, Ulan-Ude, Khabarovsk, and 
Kaliningrad. The organization of exploratory and prospecting 
work for highly protected aquifers, whose reserves can satisfy 
part of the need, is urgent for the aforesaid points. 
  The next group should include cities which at the present 
time entirely or partly meet the needs for water of drinking 
quality with reliably protected ground waters, but it is 
necessary to carry out exploratory and prospecting work in order 
to meet the long-term need (Bryansk, Vladimir, Kaluga, Orel, 
Belgorod, Ulyanovsk, Groznyy, Magnitogorsk, Kemerovo, Chita, 
Tomsk). 
  Finally, the last, largest group is made up of cities whose 
requirements for water for the domestic and drinking water 
supply can be met partially. These include major cities whose 
present water supply is entirely or almost entirely based on 
surface waters, such as Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yaroslavl, 
Yekaterinburg, Perm, Rostov-na-Donu, Astrakhan, Omsk, 
Novosibirsk, and others, as well as Saransk, Tyumen, and Tula. 
For all the cities belonging to this group, in addition to 
opening up the explored reserves, it is necessary to organize 
exploratory and prospecting work aimed both at ascertaining and 
exploring deposits whose reserves can satisfy a substantial part 
of the need and at ascertaining promising sectors for the 
construction of bottling plants. At the same time exploratory 
and prospecting work must encompass considerable areas. 
  In discussing the situation with regard to ground waters -- 
extremely topical in the context of the requirements and the 
quality of the water which we drink -- the participants in the 
Interdepartmental Commission session pointed out that water 
conservation measures in recent years have been financed at the 
level of 20 percent of what is needed. The Goskomsanepidnadzor 
has drawn up an economic mechanism based on paid water 
consumption, but its introduction is being held up by the 
absence of a legislative base. 
  The service for monitoring the state of ground waters and, 
primarily, their quality, requires substantial development and 
improvement. In connection with a higher degree of protection 
for ground waters against pollution the strategy for providing 
the population with drinking water must be aimed at making all 
possible use of ground waters to improve the reliability of 
domestic and drinking water supply systems. 
  With a view to increasing the volume of groundwater used to 
supply drinking water to the population, protecting it from 
pollution and depletion, and reducing the risk of groundwater 
pollution for the health of the population, the 
Interdepartmental Commission considers it necessary: 
  1. For the Russian Federation Government to be asked to 
elaborate a state program for providing the Russian population 
with quality drinking water that is reliably protected against 
pollution. 
  2. For the Russian Federation Committee for Geology and the 
Use of Natural Resources to carry out work to assess the degree 
of provision of the Russian population with groundwater sources 
that are reliably protected against pollution. 
  3. For the Russian Federation Ministry of Civil Defense, 
Emergencies, and Natural Disasters in conjunction with the 
Russian Federation Committee for Geology and the Use of Natural 
Resources to assess the degree of provision of drinking waters 
for public water supply systems during emergency situations, and 
to elaborate a plan of measures to organize supplies of drinking 
water during such periods. 
  4. For the Russian Federation Committees for Water Resources 
and Geology and the Use of Natural Resources to take an 
inventory of utilized and unutilized groundwater deposits and of 
water intakes operating on unproved reserves, and to assess the 
possibility of developing explored but unutilized deposits. 
  5. For the Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary 
and Epidemiological Supervision to conduct work to assess the 
arrangements for economic activity in zones subject to sanitary 
controls for existing groundwater intakes and to submit 
proposals to executive organs for improving the protection of 
groundwaters against pollution. 
  6. For a recommendation to be given to executive organs 
within Federation components to carry out the necessary 
exploratory and prospecting work for groundwaters in order to 
enhance the reliability of domestic and drinking water supply 
systems. 
  7. For the Russian Federation Committee for Geology and the 
Use of Natural Resources to draw up proposals for the Russian 
Federation Government to develop a system for monitoring 
groundwaters with a view to monitoring its condition as a source 
for the domestic and drinking water supply. 
  8. For the State Duma to be asked to expedite the 
examination and ratification of the Russian Federation Water 
Code and the Russian Federation Law on the Supply of Drinking 
Water to the Population, and to elaborate a Russian Federation 
Law "On the Protection of Groundwater." 
  9. For the Russian Federation Committees for Water Resources 
and for Geology and the Use of Natural Resources to elaborate 
normative documents for payments for the right to use water 
facilities.

  [Text] The Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources once again confirmed that there is no 
emergency situation around the Komsomolets nuclear submarine 
which drowned in the Norwegian Sea in 1989. 
  At the same time, the ministry considers it possible to 
carry 
out works on encasing of the front section where two torpedoes 
with nuclear charges are located. Experts are particularly 
concerned about the possible escape of radioactive plutonium 
from these torpedoes. The torpedoes have been partially 
destroyed as a result of the ship going under and an explosion 
in the front section. The nuclear reactor was taken out of 
operation before the sinking and any negayive effects on the 
environment is ruled out. 
  This was said at a press conference in Moscow on Wednesday, 
dedicated to Russian press reports about the allegedly critical 
situation around the submarine. 
  First Deputy Minister Aleksey Poryadin, referring to the 
conclusion of the state ecological investigation, noted that at 
the depth of 1,700 meters, where the submarine is lying, fishing 
is not being carried out, therefore "a radioactive and 
ecological threat posed by the release of substances after 
plutonium decay of the nuclear explosives" does not exist. At 
the same time, experts of the ministry consider it necessary to 
constantly check the ecological situation in the region around 
Komsomolets before and after installment of localizing systems. 
  Poryadin pointed out that localization of the front section 
will be carried out with the purpose of preventing the release 
of radioactive substances, the probability of which, in his 
opinion, is very low. He said that the cost of the works had 
been estimated approximately, but it is too early to speak about 
a concrete sum. 
  Poryadin said, referring to the London Convention on 
prevention of water pollution from waste and other substances 
(1972), that "force-majeur circumstances to which the death of 
the submarine is related" exclude presenting claims to Russia 
from other countries. 
  Poryadin said that in three weeks a Russia expedition on 
board the Mstislav Keldysh ship will head for the place of the 
Komsomolets accident in order to control the radiation and 
ecological situation in the area. 
  According to the ministry, the expeditions in 1988, 
1991-1993, did not find increased levels of plutonium in the 
water or on the sea's bottom.

<F P=106> [ECO-PRESS report: "German-Russian Memorandum"] </F>
  [Text] The ministers of environmental protection of Russia 
and Germany--V.I. Danilov-Danilyan and K. Toepfer--signed in 
Bonn an agreement on cooperation in the collection, transfer, 
analysis, and evaluation of radiological data, and the creation 
in the Russian Federation of an integrated measuring-information 
system (IRIS). The two countries have been cooperating in this 
area since 1993, and this agreement provides a legal base and 
defines more precisely the parties' obligations, tasks, and 
functions. 
  The IRIS is intended for monitoring facilities that present 
a 
radioactive danger; a system of sensors measuring radiation 
level is set up on the territory adjacent to the facility (for 
an AES [nuclear power station]--within a radius of 30 km). The 
information they supply is transmitted via satellite to the 
Federal Radiological Control Center. The project is currently 
being implemented at the Smolensk AES, and then be extended to 
include the Kursk and Leningrad (Sosnovyy Bor) stations. 
  By this agreement, Germany installs technical equipment at 
these facilities, delivers standard computer programs and 
develops customized ones. The Russian side provides base and 
background data, sensor installation, and provides custom 
programming and satellite communications. 
  At the signing of the agreement Klaus Toepfer said: "Whether 
we like it or not, nuclear energy will remain a substantial 
source of power supply, especially in resource-poor East 
European countries. Therefore it falls upon Germany within the 
framework of broad-scale technical cooperation to make its 
contribution to these developments and thereby help to achieve 
everywhere the high level of safety that we have achieved in our 
own country."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Russia's Choice Ecological Program: </F>
V.I. Danilov-Danilyan on Program of National Ecological 
Revival"] 
  [Text] The Russian minister of environmental protection and 
natural resources, who was elected to the State Duma by a 
federal list, said that there is "legal uncertainty" in the area 
of ecology. The minister emphasized that it is necessary to 
create as soon as possible "a legal base for environmental 
protection activities that will be in keeping with the new 
constitution." In his opinion, it should define the interaction 
between federal authorities and federation components with 
respect to natural resource utilization. 
  V.I. Danilov-Danilyan pointed out that the implementation of 
ecological policy requires tremendous capital investment and is 
only possible when the economy improves. Nevertheless, it is 
necessary to beef up the environmental protection system--in 
particular, ecological monitoring and expert evaluation. The 
minister reported that development of programs for ecological 
improvement of the regions has began. For instance, in Tula 
Oblast. 
  According to the minister, in 1993 penalty payments by 
enterprises polluting the atmosphere may possibly amount to 
about 300 billion rubles. In his opinion it is not expedient to 
increase the penalty rates, because it reduces production 
efficiency and does not lead to an improved environment. 
  The minister refuted the rumor spread by the REUTER agency 
that Russia had allegedly dumped into the ocean "half a 
Chernobyl of radioactive waste." "In reality," he clarified, 
"the volume was smaller by two orders of magnitude." 
  Russia's Choice plans a national ecological revival, said V. 
Danilov-Danilyan, based on a considerable reduction in the human 
and industrial impact on the environment. In particular, 
bringing within the norm atmospheric discharges and waste water 
dumping by industrial and agricultural enterprises, and 
developing a "repair network" for ecosystems that have become 
out of balance.

<F P=106> [Report by O. Balandina: "Marine Inspection Will Be </F>
Intensified"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Border Troops are 
responsible people. So, in the same serious manner as they are 
equipping their new base, they have begun to perform their 
primary task -- protection of our oblast's sea borders. They 
will be facing even more tasks beginning this spring. The 
Border Troops Kaliningrad Group commander and the Oblast 
Environment Protection Committee chairman have approved a plan 
for cooperation between the Border Troops marine group and the 
environment protection committee. I attended a joint meeting of 
the unit, at which 14 officers and warrant officers, who had 
gone through special training, received certificates from the 
Oblast Environment Committee as nonsalaried staff members. 
During the ceremony, Marine Inspection chief T.I. Gryn 
expressed her confidence that the engagement of the Border 
Troops staff and equipment will help to improve protection of 
the fish population, detain ships violating regulations, monitor 
sea pollution by oil, waste, and soil, as well as to constantly 
control extraction of amber, and in the future, also oil from 
platforms. Ships patrolling internal and territorial waters, the 
continental shelf, and the Russian Federation's economic zone, 
will either take on board Oblast Environment Committee 
inspectors, or they themselves will perform such duties, as 
nonsalaried staff members. Having discovered violations, they, 
as inspectors, will fill out protocols of detention. 
  The cooperation plan also envisions a permanent exchange of 
information on the situation in controlled regions and the 
location of foreign industrial or scientific-research vessels. 
The results of patrols and plans for future cooperation will be 
discussed every week at briefings with the participation of 
Marine Inspection representatives. 
  Undoubtedly, such close cooperation will significantly 
intensify control over protected waters, and will bring an end 
to illegal fishing by foreign vessels. The Border Troops have 
already begun to implement the cooperation plan.

<F P=106> [Bjorn Lindahl report: "Swedish Air Environmental Villain </F>
in Russia"] 
  [Text] Oslo -- Sweden causes more pollution in Russia than 
vice versa. 
  This is the surprising result arrived at by Norwegian 
meteorologists when they tried to measure air pollution which is 
spread across borders. 
  Russia receives three times as much sulfur dioxide and 
nitric 
oxide from Western Europe than it exports to the West. 
  In June the states of Europe will sign a protocol on sulfur 
emissions in Oslo. In the context of this meeting the 
Meteorological Institute has compiled figures for cross-border 
emissions which contradict the picture of Russia as the big 
environmental threat. 
  It is true that the country's industry is highly polluting, 
but because the wind mainly blows from the southwest to the 
northeast most of Russia's dirt lands in Russia. 
  If we look at the balance between Sweden and Russia 6,200 
tonnes of sulfur and 16,400 tonnes of nitric oxide are 
transported from Sweden to Russia, while Russian pollution in 
Sweden amounts to 5,600 tonnes of sulfur and 1,300 tonnes of 
nitric oxide. 
  Sweden, Norway, and Finland are countries which because of 
their location receive relatively large quantities of pollutants 
from Russia. 
  If we look at the EU [European Union] countries they spew 
forth 118,000 tonnes of sulfur which land in Russia, while we 
receive only 600 tonnes of sulfur. 
  "The chaos in Russia means that the inhabitants there have 
lost their balance. As a result they are an easy target for a 
Western description of the environmental problems which is not 
particularly balanced. We should not paralyze Russia by simply 
concentrating on their environmental emissions," said Rune 
Castberg, a researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute who has 
specialized in Russia. 
  He predicts that Russia will become much more aggressive on 
environmental issues too and will demand that the countries of 
Western Europe clean up their own backyards before criticizing 
Russia. 
  The sulfur protocol which environment ministers from 28 
countries are to sign in Oslo on 13 June contains several new 
principles. 
  These include the notions that natural vulnerability must be 
taken as the foundation when it comes to regulating emissions 
and that countries must work together to a much greater extent 
to achieve the best results. 
  "The protocol makes it possible for a country like Norway, 
which to a large extent has only automobiles and ships as 
sources of nitric oxide emissions, to invest in purification 
plants on the Kola Peninsula instead. 
  "As a result an overall reduction in emissions can be 
achieved that is greater than would have been the case if 
similar amounts of money had been invested in a pool of 
environmentally sound automobiles which would after all only be 
replaced in time," Thorstein Dreyer, information chief at the 
Norwegian Environment Ministry, said.

<F P=106> ["Draft Concept of Russian Federation Environmental </F>
Security"] 
  [Text] When the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources begin developing 
a draft "Concept of Russian Federation Environmental Security" 
in February 1992 it recruited the assistance of more than 50 
scientists and specialists from the Russian Academy of Sciences, 
the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and the science sections 
of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Russian 
Ministry of Health and other ministries. The project's 
scientific director was V. G. Gorelov, doctor of medical 
sciences and deputy chief of the Russian Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Main 
Administration for Environmental Security. 
  When (on 8 February 1993) a draft version of this 
Concept was approved in its entirety by the ministry board, a 
recommendation was made by A. V. Yablokov, Russian presidential 
advisor for ecology and health care, that the draft Concept be 
sent to regional environmental protection agencies so that they 
could examine it, interpret it, discuss it and formulate their 
comments and suggestions... 
  The Main Administration for Environmental Security 
under the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources [Minprirody Rossii], taking the numerous 
comments into consideration, further edited the draft in the 
spring of last year and, as is customary, sent it out for 
consultation with regional environmental protection agencies and 
affected ministries and agencies. We should note that an 
absolute majority of the 46 responses (41 from environmental 
protection agencies and five from ministries and other agencies) 
received by the framers of the draft Concept expressed support 
for the main points in the Concept. 
  All comments and suggestions of a primarily editorial 
or clarifying nature were taken into consideration in the 
version of the draft Concept being published in ZELENYY MIR 
today under the heading "A Document --Let Us Discuss It..." 
  Do the Concept's authors agree with all the comments? 
No -- they contested all comments that were purely directed 
toward a single department (the Russian State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight [Gossanepidnadzor Rossii] and 
the Russian Federation State Committee on Civil Defense, 
Emergency Situations and Liquidation of the Consequences of 
Natural Disasters [GKChS Rossii]). But compromises were reached 
on those points as well in the course of further editing.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  This Concept reflects the official views of the Russian 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources 
(Minprirody Rossii) on current principles, methods and 
mechanisms for environmental protection and efficient use of 
natural resources, which are an inalienable part of state policy 
with regard to our country's economic and social development. 
  The current scale of environmental changes is creating a 
real 
threat to the public's life and health. The necessity of 
compensating for losses due to major accidents and natural 
disasters will require that economic resources be shifted away 
from performing strategic tasks in connection with the formation 
of a new economic structure toward fruitless attempts to 
maintain the economy in its current state. 
  The greatest environmental threat is due to chemical 
factors, 
protection against which should be regarded as a priority 
objective. A faulty method of neutralizing emissions and 
discharges now predominates -- i.e. their dispersion and 
dilution to "safe" levels, levels that were established without 
consideration for the possibility of secondary concentration of 
eco-toxins at points in the environment, or their transformation 
into more toxic compounds. Particularly dangerous are the 
super-toxins, pollution by which is increasingly rapidly. There 
is a tremendous environmental threat from radioactive 
contamination, and one that is rapidly increasing in proportion 
to the accumulation of radioactive waste from spent atomic 
reactors from nuclear power plants, submarines, nuclear-powered 
surface ships, etc. There is a great danger of changes in the 
biological balance, particularly the correlation between 
pathogenic and saprophytic microorganisms and undesirable 
mutations in them. 
  The speed with which the intensity of the adverse effects of 
external factors is increasing has surpassed limits on the speed 
of living systems' capability of biological adaptation to their 
environment. Destabilization of the environment is directly 
linked to a decline in public health. Russia ranks fifty-first 
in the world in terms of average life span, and its infant 
mortality rate is high. If these negative trends are not halted, 
then by the middle of the 21st century scarcity of food, water 
and oxygen, coupled with the genetic burden, will significantly 
accelerate the degeneration of populations and their gradual 
extinction. 
  The basis for the creation of an environmental security 
policy is the creation of an adequate organizational, legal and 
sociopolitical economic mechanism for the management of natural 
resource use that is based on modern quantitative data regarding 
the possibility of counteracting anthropogenic and 
naturally-occurring biosphere destruction. 
  In order to solve these urgent problems it is essential to 
formulate a general Concept of Russian Environmental Security 
and develop a methodology for its implementation. 
<H8>  1. General Principles </H8>
<H5>  1.1. Fundamental Concepts and Definitions </H5>
  The environmental threat is the probability of 
destruction of the human habitat and the plants and animals 
connected with it as a result of uncontrolled economic 
development, outdated technologies and anthropogenic accidents 
and disasters which result in disruption of living systems' 
adaptation to the conditions under which they exist. 
  Environmental security is the process of providing 
protection for the vitally important interests of the 
individual, society, nature and the state against actual or 
potential threats created by human or natural influence on the 
environment. 
  An environmental security system is the aggregate 
of legislative, technical, medical and biological measures aimed 
at supporting the balance between the biosphere and both 
anthropogenic and natural external burdens. 
  The subjects of environmental security are the 
individual, society, the biosphere and the state. 
  The objects of environmental security are the 
vitally important interests of the subjects of security -- 
rights, the individual's physical and intellectual needs, 
natural resources and the natural environment -- as the physical 
foundation of state and social development. 
  An environmental security policy is purposeful 
action by the state, public organizations and legal and physical 
persons to ensure environmental security. 
  Environmental risk is the probability of 
unfavorable effects on the environment as the results of any 
anthropogenic changes in natural sites or factors. 
  Maximum permissible environmental burden is the 
maximum level of effects by anthropogenic factors at which the 
functional integrity of ecosystems is maintained. 
  An environmental emergency zone is a section of 
territory where as a result of commercial or other activities 
there occur persistent negative changes in the environment, 
resulting in disruption of public health or disruption of the 
balance among natural ecosystems, in particular damage to the 
genetic stock of plants and animals. 
  An environmental disaster area is a section of 
territory where as a result of commercial or other activities 
and/or natural disasters irreversible changes have occurred in 
the environment, resulting in a rise in the rate of diseases and 
mortality among the population and destruction of biocenoses. 
  Health is a state of complete physical, mental and 
social well-being, not simply the absence of the incidence of 
disease or disability (World Health Organization). 
<H5>  1.2. Specific Economic and Social Features of Russia's </H5>
Development 
  From the standpoint of environmental security one must 
delineate the following specific economic and social features of 
Russia's development: 
  -- extensive development of the economy coupled with 
single-purpose use of natural resources, huge volumes of raw 
materials extraction and sales, the absence of a system for 
processing household and industrial wastes, and development of 
new agricultural land and abandonment of previous agricultural 
areas; 
  -- a distorted economic structure with a prevalence of 
natural resource-intensive types of production that create a 
constant and excessive overload on ecosystems; 
  -- a militarized economy; 
  -- unreliable technical systems and inadequate training of 
personnel at enterprises with heightened environmental risk; 
  -- outdated and ineffective environmental protection 
equipment at the final stages of technological processes; 
  -- biological hazard -- danger to human beings, produce and 
natural ecosystems as a result of activity by living organisms; 
  -- increasing urban population and an increasing supply of 
goods and services in the state-owned and private sectors of the 
economy, resulting in greater consumption of natural resources; 
  -- natural and anthropogenic accidents, disasters and 
catastrophes; 
  -- transportation-related effects; 
  -- a distorted system for assessing environmental benefit 
and 
environmental losses, resulting in unprofitable natural resource 
use; 
  -- a lack of institutions and experience with environmental 
regulation of commercial activities; 
  -- a lack of a well-designed national system for 
environmental education and training and cultivation of an 
environmental world view; 
  -- a lack of unity in the state's administration of 
environmental security. 
<H5>  1.3. Laws, Principles and Regulations Pertaining to </H5>
Biosphere Function 
<H5>  Laws </H5>
  "Internal dynamic balance": the matter, energy, 
information and quality of individual natural systems and their 
hierarchy are interconnected to such an extent that any change 
in one of those indices causes accompanying 
functional-structural qualitative and quantitative changes, 
maintaining the total amount of matter and energy and the 
informational and dynamic qualities of systems and their 
hierarchies. 
  "All or nothing" (Kh. Boumech [sp?]): weak 
influences may not cause reciprocal reactions in natural systems 
until such time as they accumulate and result in the development 
of a turbulent, dynamic process. 
  "The minimum" (Yu. Libikh): opportunities for life 
are delimited by environmental factors, the number and quality 
of which is close to the required minimum for an organism or an 
ecosystem, and further reduction thereof will result in the 
death of the organism or destruction of the ecosystem. 
  "Evolutionary and environmental irreversibility": 
an ecosystem that has lost part of its elements cannot return to 
its original state. 
  "The irreplaceability of the biosphere" (V. G. 
Gorshkov): reduction of the natural biota in an amount 
exceeding a threshold level deprives the environment of 
stability that cannot be restored through the use of treatment 
facilities or a transition to no-waste production. 
<H5>  Principles </H5>
  The Le Shatelier-Braun Principle: in the event of 
an external influence that brings a system out of stable 
balance, the balance shifts in the direction in which the 
external influence becomes weaker. 
  Remoteness of events: a phenomenon that is distant 
in time or space appears less significant. In the field of 
natural resource use this principle is especially frequently the 
basis for incorrect practical measures. 
  Sudden intensification of pathogenicity: 
unexpected intensification of pathogenicity occurs upon mutation 
of a disease-producing organism, upon introduction of a new 
disease-producing organism into an ecosystem which has no 
mechanisms to regulate its numbers, or upon a very sharp change 
in the ecosystem's environment. 
  Reasonable sufficiency and acceptability of risk: 
expansion of any human activities should not result in 
socioeconomic or environmental disasters. 
<H5>  Rules </H5>
  Mutual adaptation (K. Mebius and G. F. Morozov): 
species in a biocenosis are adapted to each other to such an 
extent that their community constitutes an internally 
contradictory yet unified and interconnected systemic whole. 
  Integral resource: competition between economic 
sectors with regard to the use of specific natural systems is 
inevitable, and they harm each other more in proportion to how 
significantly they change their jointly exploited environmental 
component or the entire ecosystem. 
  Measures of natural system transformation: in the 
course of utilizing natural systems there are certain bounds 
that must not be overstepped if those systems are to maintain 
their self-supporting capacity (self-organization and 
self-regulation). 
  Correspondence between environmental conditions and an 
organism's genetic predisposition: a species of an organism 
can exist only so long as the natural environment surrounding it 
is in line with that species' genetic adaptation capacity 
relative to the environment's variations and changes. 
  Chain reactions from "strict" management of 
nature: "strict" and, as a rule, technical management of 
natural processes is fraught with the possibility of chain 
reactions, a significant portion of which will prove 
environmentally, socially and economically unacceptable. 
<H5>  1.4. Fundamental Principles of Ensuring Environmental </H5>
Security 
  The fundamental principles of ensuring environmental 
security 
consist of the following: 
  -- social and economic development of society in the course 
of which people are ensured an improving quality of life coupled 
with a reduction in or stabilization of negative effects on the 
natural environment, and in which the laws of development for 
the biosphere and natural climate zones are observed; 
  -- compliance with permissible levels of effects on the 
natural environment and on human beings as established by the 
state and the components of the Federation; 
  -- non-depleting natural resource use in which the resource 
supply satisfies the interests of current and future generations 
equally; 
  -- the obligation to compensate for damage done to the 
health 
of human beings and nature, and mutual responsibility of 
territorial administrative units for the state of the 
environment and cross-border transfer of pollutants; 
  -- timely identification and restoration of disrupted 
territories (or bodies of water), ecosystems and natural 
complexes; 
  -- preservation of biological diversity; 
  -- the applicability of international law and compliance 
with 
bilateral and multilateral treaties regulating natural resource 
use and quality of life. 
<H5>  1.5. Goals of the Concept of Environmental Security </H5>
  The goals of this Concept are: 
  -- development of conceptual foundations for an overall 
strategy in the field of environmental protection and efficient 
use of natural resources for the purpose of our country's 
sustainable economic and social development; 
  -- definition of achievable mid-range and long-range goals 
and tasks in the field of environmental protection; 
  -- definition of the structure and tasks of and mutual 
relations between components of the system for Russia's ensuring 
environmental security; 
  -- identification of specific goals and tasks involved in 
the 
planning of policy and programs that must be adopted and carried 
out by the Government and regional administrative bodies. 
<H8>  2. Environmental Problems and Trends </H8>
  The current state of the environment attests to the fact 
that 
environmental problems are due to two basic factors: wasteful 
natural resource use, which reduces the biosphere's 
productivity, and pollution, which threatens all living things 
and in particular human health and well-being. It would be 
appropriate to consider critical environmental problems within 
the framework of the following sections: the atmosphere, inland 
surface and underground waters and seas, soil protection and 
land use, forests, wilderness and genetic resources, wastes and 
toxic chemicals, social factors, energy, industry and 
transportation. 
<H5>  2.1. The Atmosphere </H5>
  The principle pollutants in the air and precipitation are 
sulfur oxides, nitrogen, carbon, airborne organic substances, 
suspended particles, bonded heavy metals and organic compounds. 
These all have an adverse cumulative effect on human health, 
animals and plants. 
  Also alarming are pollutants such as chlorofluorocarbons, 
halogens, and nitrogen and carbon oxides, which alter the 
distribution and concentration of ozone, affect the thermal 
balance and change climate. 
  Environmental problems connected with the cross-border 
transfer of atmospheric pollutants over great distances are 
acute. 
<H5>  2.2. Inland Waters and Seas </H5>
  The priority environmental problems in the field of water 
protection are: 
  -- diversion of water from a number of river basins and 
underground sources in excess of environmentally permissible 
levels; 
  -- depletion of small rivers; 
  -- large water losses as a result of water system disrepair 
and imperfect technological processes; 
  -- discharge of polluted waste water into bodies of water; 
  -- cross-border water pollution. 
  The greatest contribution to surface water pollution comes 
from enterprises in the ferrous and non-ferrous metals, 
chemical, petrochemical, oil, gas, coal, timber and paper 
industries, as well as agricultural enterprises and municipal 
services enterprises. 
  Russia's sea basins are beings polluted by petroleum 
products, phenols, copper, zinc and chrome compounds and 
chloro-organic pesticides, with a trend toward increasing levels 
of pollution. 
<H5>  2.3. Soil Protection and Land Use </H5>
  The following types of pollution and soil degradation are 
most widespread in various regions: 
  -- planar and channel erosion; 
  -- gully erosion; 
  -- accumulation or depletion of specific chemical elements; 
  -- rise or fall in underground water level; 
  -- salination; 
  -- solonetzization; 
  -- loss of organic substances and humus; 
  -- loss of nutritive elements and increasing soil acidity; 
  -- accumulation of toxic substances; etc. 
  Large-scale use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides 
has 
resulted in contamination of surface waters and alteration of 
aquatic ecosystems. 
  As a result of erosion processes, the spread of excessively 
wet, salinated or swampy land, and overgrowth by forests and 
shrubs there has been a decrease in the extent of arable land. 
  Soils for a distance of several tens of kilometers around 
cities and industrial centers are contaminated by petroleum 
products, heavy metals and toxic organic substances. 
  Large sections of land have been removed from agricultural 
use by development of oil, gas and coal fields, iron ore 
deposits and other minerals. The mining industry is one of the 
largest sources of environmental degradation and pollution. 
<H5>  2.4. Forests </H5>
  Degradation of forests results from gaseous air pollutants, 
precipitation of acidic components and heavy metals, changes in 
climatic conditions, etc. 
  As a result of intensive commercial activity and losses due 
to forest fires, stands of mature timber are declining in 
evergreen forests in the European part of Russia. Forests are 
protected against fires on just 65 percent of Russia's total 
forest area. 
  Deforestation creates environmental problems such as rapid 
sedimentation of bodies of water, soil erosion, reduction in 
water supply, etc. 
<H5>  2.5. Biological Diversity </H5>
  The present state of the environment permits one to define 
the principal negative phenomena in the environmental life cycle 
as: 
  -- decreasing biological diversity; 
  -- smaller populations of a number of species; 
  -- accelerated aging of populations; 
  -- disappearance of individual species from biocenoses; 
  -- impoverishment of flora and fauna, particularly in areas 
with a high concentration of industry and population. 
<H5>  2.6. Wastes </H5>
  Russia currently has more than 50 billion metric tons of 
wastes stored on an area of 250,000 hectares. A significant 
portion of this waste is classified as toxic substances of 
industrial origin. Russia lacks appropriate environmental 
standards for enterprises with regard to the neutralization and 
storage of toxic industrial waste. 
  Approximately four billion curies of radioactive waste have 
accumulated in special containers, uncovered pools, other bodies 
of water and near-surface burial sites. 
  Each year more than 130 million metric tons of solid 
household waste is created and transported to dumps and 
landfills. Industrial and household wastes place a major burden 
on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and present a serious 
threat to the health of human beings and the environment. 
<H5>  2.7. Energy, Industry and Transportation </H5>
  Approximately 25 percent of all substances that pollute the 
air in Russia enter the environment as a result of the 
combustion of fuel in power-producing, heating and industrial 
boilers. 
  The degree of environmental pollution in areas where heavy 
industry is concentrated is horrifying. 
  Motor vehicle exhaust fumes pollute the air with 
hydrocarbons, lead and oxides of sulfur, nitrogen and carbon, 
and also contribute to acid rain. 
<H5>  2.8. Social Factors </H5>
  The social environment may be envisioned as being comprised 
of subsystems such as demography, economics, education, social 
structure and culture, as well as dependent factors -- stresses 
on human beings. 
  In this period of economic transition to a market economy 
the 
following events have become critical: 
  -- loss of our country's intellectual potential due to 
emigration by scientists and specialists; 
  -- changes in nutrition; 
  -- a decline in the birthrate; 
  -- lack of access to medical care among certain segments of 
the population; 
  -- vocational reorientation; 
  -- inaccessibility of recreational sites due to their high 
cost; 
  -- a state of heightened personal and social stress. 
<H8>  3. A System of Long-Range Goals </H8>
  The following may be defined as strategic goals: 
  -- creation of an environment favorable to human health; 
  -- assurance of rational, non-depleting natural resource 
use, 
biosphere balance, preservation of the genetic stock as well as 
species and landscape diversity, and balance between the 
processes of reproduction and utilization of renewable natural 
resources.

<H8>  4. The Russian Environmental Security System (RosSEB) </H8>
<H5>  4.1. Goals and Tasks </H5>
  The components required for compliance with environmental 
security requirements are guarantees of chemical, radiation, 
biological and industrial safety throughout Russia. 
  Involved in the implementation of measures designed to 
achieve, maintain and monitor compliance with environmental 
security requirements are various Russia ministries, agencies, 
institutions and organizations. A real effect from such measures 
can be achieved only if they are applied in a comprehensive 
manner, which in turn will require the application of a 
clearly-defined mechanism for organizational management of all 
participants in this process. A Russian Environmental Security 
System (RosSEB) [Rossiyskaya sistema ekologicheskoy 
bezopasnosti) will have to be established to provide that 
mechanism. 
  RosSEB's principal tasks will be: 
  -- organizational management of the process of achieving 
target indices of environmental security throughout all of 
Russia and in its individual territorial administrative units; 
  -- organization and implementation of monitoring of 
compliance with environmental security requirements; 
  -- interaction with other state systems working to support 
the life of society and the public, in particular with the 
Russian Council on Emergency Situations; 
  -- prevention and elimination of the environmental effects 
of 
industrial and natural accidents and disasters; 
  -- prevention of the emergence of environmental problem and 
disaster zones or environmental emergencies, as well as 
participation in the organization of efforts to eliminate their 
effects when they do emerge; 
  -- assessment of the state of environmental security in 
Russia, and projection of its dynamics; 
  -- provision of a unified state policy that will formulate 
guarantees for the reliable existence and sustainable 
development of the objects of environmental security; 
  -- planning and coordination of compliance with 
comprehensive 
programs for environmental protection and efficient natural 
resource use; 
  -- creation, development and equipping of personnel and 
means 
for ensuring environmental security in Russia; 
  -- coordination of international agreements on ways to 
ensure 
Russia's environmental security. 
<H5>  4.2. RosSEB Structure </H5>
  RosSEB will consist of macrosystem administrative bodies, 
personnel and equipment which will support systems and perform 
the tasks assigned to RosSEB, as well as means of information 
support for the decision-making process. All these elements of 
the macrosystem should be interconnected in a single system for 
information transfer and command-and-administrative actions. 
  Establishment of the RosSEB should occur on principles of 
organizational unification of the individual functional elements 
and structures which currently exist within ministries and 
agencies for the purpose of resolving individual environmental 
security issues. 
  The principal organizational support mechanisms should be: 
  -- directed state programs in the field of environmental 
security; 
  -- unified environmental security requirements; 
  -- unified targeted indices of environmental security and 
unified regulations and procedures for achieving them; 
  -- unified state monitoring of compliance with environmental 
security requirements and compliance with target indices; 
  -- information interaction in support of organizational 
management. Performance of these functions should be assigned to 
the state administrative agency that is responsible for 
implementation of policy in the field of environmental security, 
i.e. the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources (see chart). 
  The functional subsystems of environmental security 
administration include: 
  -- a subsystem for regional administration of environmental 
security; 
  -- a subsystem for administration of the environmental 
security of potentially hazardous sites; 
  -- a subsystem for management of industrially-produced and 
other environmentally hazardous and toxic wastes; 
  -- a subsystem for nuclear and radiation security; 
  -- a subsystem for recovery from the effects of 
environmental 
emergencies; 
  -- a subsystem for management of environmental security in 
connection with military activities (with the exception of a 
special period); 
  -- a subsystem for management of the state of public health; 
  -- a state monitoring system (environmental monitoring, 
industrial monitoring, etc.). 
  The state monitoring system: 
  environmental monitoring (EGSM [Unified State Monitoring 
System], EGASKRO [expansion unclear]); 
  medical and biological monitoring (the AIS "Zdorovye" 
[Health 
Analysis and Information System], etc.); 
  monitoring of industrial, energy-related and transportation 
facilities; 
  monitoring of nuclear power facilities; 
  monitoring of potentially hazardous sites; 
  monitoring of sites where hazardous chemical, radioactive or 
biological wastes and substances are stored or buried; 
  monitoring of production- and consumption-related wastes; 
  monitoring of shipments of hazardous substances and 
materials; 
  monitoring of hazardous natural phenomena; 
  Monitoring of global natural phenomena and processes; 
monitoring of agricultural production; 
  monitoring of soils and land. 
  The federal information and analysis system: 
  the information and analysis system (IAS) for environmental 
security under the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection 
and Natural Resources; 
  territorial (regional) information and analysis systems 
under 
the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources; 
  the Russian Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight 
[Gosgortekhnadzor] IAS; 
  the Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation 
Safety 
[Gosatomnadzor] IAS; 
  the Russian State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological 
Oversight [Gossanepidnadzor] and Ministry of Health IAS; 
  the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and 
Environmental Control [Rosgidromet] IAS. 
  The Environmental Security Automated Information and 
Control System [AIUS "Ekologicheskaya bezopasnost"]: 
  a consultation and administration system under the Russian 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources (the 
Ministry's central apparatus); 
  a consultation and administration system under regional 
agencies of the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection 
(the Ministry's regional committees); 
  administrative systems under the Russian State Committee for 
Emergency Situations, Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight, 
Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, the State 
Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, the Russian 
Ministry of Health, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and 
Environmental Control. 
  The means of achieving environmental security are: 
  a normative legal foundation; 
  environmental programs; 
  state environmental monitoring; 
  licensing of activities; 
  environmental impact assessment; 
  regulations and standards; 
  environmental education and training; 
  international cooperation. 
  The personnel that will ensure environmental security are: 
  subordinate divisions of environmental assessment and 
inspection agencies; 
  Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection emergency 
environmental aid personnel; 
  subordinate divisions of the Russian Ministry of Defense, 
the 
Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Russian Ministry of 
Security; 
  subordinate divisions of the Russian State Committee for 
Emergency Situations, including Civil Defense units; 
  medical services; 
  services for the protection of plant and animal life; 
  subordinate divisions of the Russian Ministry of 
Transportation, the Russian Ministry of Railways, and other 
specialized units and divisions which carry out measures and 
actions to protect the public and the natural environment. 
  The objects of administration are the ministries and 
agencies 
which carry out state administration of environmentally harmful 
and hazardous types of activities, in particular the Russian 
Ministry of Atomic Energy, Ministry of Fuel and Energy, Ministry 
of Industry, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Railways, 
Ministry of Agriculture and State Committee for Architecture and 
Construction. 
<H8>  5. The Mechanism for Ensuring Russia's Environmental Security </H8>
  The mechanisms for achieving this goal are: 
  -- a legislative and normative legal basis for activities in 
the field of environmental security; 
  -- an organizational basis for administration of efforts 
with 
regard to ensuring environmental security; 
  -- economic mechanisms; 
  -- a technological basis for environmentally safe 
development 
of industry, energy production and transportation; 
  -- state monitoring of activities by ministries and agencies 
in the field of compliance with environmental security 
requirements as they go about implementing Russia's state 
environmental policy; 
  -- use of scientific-technical and production potential in 
the defense sectors of industry. 
<H8>  6. Conditions Essential for the Implementation of </H8>
Environmental Security Strategy 
  Environmental security must become an inseparable part of 
efforts by the state and its organs in the field of ensuring the 
overall security of society and the state. 
  Environmental protection efforts must become one of the most 
important functions of the legislative, executive and judicial 
branches of government. 
  Environmental protection is based on integration of 
environmental, economic and social policy. 
  Economic development is based on development of low-waste 
and 
no-waste technologies and minimizing of the social and 
environmental cost of economic activity. 
  There must be active participation in compliance with 
international conventions on the environment. 
  Current and pending Russian Federation legislation regarding 
environmental protection and the rational use of natural 
resources as well as the Statute on the Russian Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources are to be based 
on this Concept. 
  Materials from annual Russian Federation state reports on 
the 
state of the environment, the United Nations Environmental 
Program (UNEP) and materials from the International Labor 
Organization, UNESCO, the European Economic Community and the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were used 
in the preparation of this Concept. 
  Individual environmental security concepts submitted to the 
Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources by scientists from various institutions were also 
analyzed.

<F P=106> [Interview with A. M. Dorofeyev, chairman of Belarus State </F>
Ecological Committee, by A. Larin; place and date not given: "A 
Man of Action. If I Survive Until My Pension"] 
  [Text] Look at the photograph. It shows the transfer of 
power of the chairman of the CIS Interstate Ecological Council 
(MES). Timofey Fomich Yanchuk, MES executive secretary is on the 
left, Askhad Sharipovich Khabibulayev, chairman of the 
Uzbekistan State Committee on Nature is on the right. Anatoliy 
Maksimovich Dorofeyev, chairman of the Belarus State Ecological 
Committee is shown in the middle. Presently the coordination of 
environmental preservation work in his native post-Soviet space 
is concentrated specifically in his hands. It is a complicated 
global task. In addition to that it is painstaking and intensive 
work in Belarus itself. Anatoliy Maksimovich has already been 
occupying this post for 3.5 years. Before that he did scientific 
work (an ornithologist by profession), taught and occupied the 
post of prorector at the Vitebsk Pedagogical Institute. 
According to Anatoliy Maksimovich himself it is very difficult 
for a person with his background to become an administrator. In 
my opinion, however, the Belarus State Ecological Committee was 
very fortunate with regard to its chairman. In his leisure time 
Anatoliy Maksimovich conducts ecological and regional studies 
and loves museums. Among the ones he visits most frequently are 
the Moscow State University Zoological Museum and the zoological 
museum on Vasilyev Island in St. Petersburg. It is remarkable 
when environmental protection work is managed by a person who 
loves and appreciates nature not only during working hours or 
because of the post he occupies. 
  Larin: Tell us please about the basics of the 
environmental protection strategy of the Republic of Belarus. 
  Dorofeyev: I am impressed with the viewpoint held 
by Albert Gora to the effect that the entire economy should be 
"green." It is clear, however, that this is something that will 
be possible only in the distant future. Meantime, while we are 
shifting to a market economy what is most important is 
introduction of an economic mechanism for the protection of the 
environment. In many respects it has already been implemented. A 
law on the ecological tax was introduced back in November 1991. 
The nonbudgetary environmental protection fund was restored (60 
percent of it remains at the rayon level, 30 percent goes to the 
oblast, and 10 percent to the republic). Laws concerning 
protection of the environment and a commission of ecological 
experts have been adopted. They were received quite well by the 
specialists. The law on industrial and consumption waste was 
adopted quite recently, in November 1993, the law on specially 
protected natural territories was adopted in its first reading. 
  Larin: As far as I know there is no law on waste 
anywhere in the CIS. 
  Dorofeyev: Probably not. All of us hastened to 
rewrite it. That is the usual practice in relations. Whoever 
does it first, he will share with all. The law on protection and 
rational utilization of the animal and vegetable world was 
worked out in detail. It was highly praised at the Institute of 
Environmental Protection in Frankfort on the Main. On the whole 
it is planned to adopt 16 laws in the sphere of protection and 
utilization of natural resources. Many would like to see strict 
maximalist laws. But as long as we live in a transitional 
period, the laws will also be of a transitional nature. 
  Larin: Anatoliy Maksimovich, one of the most 
painful issues concerns finances. 
  Dorofeyev: I cannot shout "Hurrah!" for the 
financing that we receive. Some 1.5 percent of the budget goes 
for ecology plus a certain part of all capital investments. The 
total amounts to 2.5 percent. I am pleased with the tendency 
toward an increase in expenditures on ecology. Even though thus 
far there is no improvement in the situation and we have no 
right to expect one in the next two to three years. 
  Larin: How are your relations with the ecological 
press? 
  Dorofeyev: We have kept the magazine RODNAYA 
PRIRODA afloat. All of its founders abandoned it. But we carried 
it out on our shoulders. The newspapers EKOLOGIYA MINSKA and 
EKOLOGICHESKIY VESTNIK published in Gomel, also appear in the 
republic. We are planning the publication of an applied science 
magazine on environmental protection. 
  Larin: Recently our newspaper informed me that a 
second "green" party, in addition to the Ecological Union, 
appeared in Belarus. What kind of relations do you have with it? 
  Dorofeyev: I have had no discussions with the 
second "green" party. The Ecological Union has a more practical 
tilt to it. They do not substitute political posturing for 
actual work. They are more concrete, which I like. The 
development of the "green" party can take place only around that 
pivotal point. 
  Larin: At present there is a lot of talk about the 
forthcoming unification of the monetary systems of Russia and 
Belarus. What is your opinion on this? 
  Dorofeyev: Unification of monetary systems does 
not mean unification of the economies. I like cooperation with 
the Russian Federation at an international level, in part, 
within the MES framework. The value of our ecological alliance 
with Russia lies in the possibility of utilizing the 
intellectual and economic potential of each other. 
  Larin: How are your relations with the Ministry of 
Nature of Russia developing? 
  Dorofeyev: I worked when Vorontsov was there and 
know many people. The relations that formed are unselfish in 
many regards. Viktor Ivanovich Danilov-Danilyan sometimes offers 
intellectual help by sending his specialists which we do not 
have. At the next MES session, which will take place in Moscow 
in May, I will be transferring the chairmanship over to him. 
  Larin: After the election of Mechislav Ivanovich 
Grib as chairman of the Supreme Council, a number of my 
colleagues have been criticizing him with considerable delight. 
Does he deserve that? 
  Dorofeyev: No. I can say that Mechislav Ivanovich 
is a person who is very decisive with a good grasp of the 
situation which has formed in the republic. I have known him for 
a long time since Vitebsk, but not closely. It is necessary to 
give him his due. He is a good jurist, a skilled legal expert, 
and he will not permit any deviations from the law. Something 
else. He is having to work in a very difficult time. 
  Larin: Are you referring to Vitebsk? 
  Dorofeyev: Yes. I have gone through practically 
all of the literature on the history of Vitebsk area. I love to 
visit the homeland of the father of Belarus literature Jan 
Borshevskiy. If I survive until my pension I must write a book 
about the history of the native area, its nature. 
  Larin: Anatoliy Maksimovich, our issue will appear 
by 8 March. 
  Dorofeyev: I would like for our ecological 
movement to do everything possible in order to promote the 
health of women. Nature is vital to life. In protecting it we 
will improve the life of all women in Russia and Belarus.

  [Text] Alarming rumors are spreading throughout the 
Crepublic faster than radiation. Namely, radiation is the 
reason for civil unrest. Therefore, our correspondent Anatol 
Awcharenka has phoned the Halowhydramet [State 
Hydrometeorological Committee]. [begin recording] 
  Awcharenka: Good day, Ivan Ivanavich 
[Matveyenka]! The Studio of Information Programs of the 
republican radio has resolved to address you to get the most 
competent information, since you are the head of the Republican 
Center for Radiation Control and Environmental Monitoring. The 
point is that our studio has received hundreds of telephone 
calls this morning -- perhaps, you have received them, too -- 
asking what has happened at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. 
Is there some emergency situation? 
  Matveyenka, in Russian: We also have received such 
calls. The Halowhydramet is monitoring the radiation level 
continually throughout the entire territory of the Republic. 
Measurements of the gamma irradiation rate are being taken at 
53 control points everyday. In the 100-kilometer zone of the 
nuclear power stations, located on the territory of Belarus, 
measurements are being taken every three hours. There are no 
changes in the radiation level in the entire Republic. 
  Awcharenka: Have you phoned the Ignalina Nuclear 
Power Plant? 
  Matveyenka: We phoned the Ignalina plant as early 
as yesterday. The radiation level around the nuclear plant is 
normal. The nuclear plant has not been in operation for about a 
month now. However, civil unrest has apparently risen due to the 
fact that the Staff of Civilian Defense... 
  Awcharenka, interrupting: Republican Staff? 
  Matveyenka:... the Oblast Staff of the Civilian 
Defense conducted exercises in Myadel Rayon and has determined 
in exercise conditions [dal vvodnyye] that the radiation level 
at Naroch [river] is above normal. 
  Awcharenka: And hence the panic among our 
population? 
  Matveyenka: Yes, well, the Staff of Civilian 
Defense perfected the actions of these organizations for iodine 
preventative treatment [pauses]... the actions of those bodies 
concerned with these questions. Therefore, such a panic arouse. 
Such a panic, an alarm, arises frequently. However, 
fortunately, all this does not correspond to the existing rumors. 
  Awcharenka: Apparently, Ivan Ivanavich, this has 
happened because these exercises were not planned [pauses]... 
  Matveyenka: Absolutely right. These exercises 
were not planned. However, they cannot be planned beforehand. 
If all these exercises are announced beforehand, then they will 
not be exercises. Therefore, all these questions [pauses]... 
apparently, the radio should give information about the holding 
of such exercises, in all the services. 
  Awcharenka: Ivan Ivanavich, we have been informed 
by our listeners, who phoned in the morning, that children are 
not allowed to go to kindergartens, that schools changed their 
schedules -- the school summer holidays will begin earlier. 
What can you say about that? 
  Matveyenka: I want to [word indistinct] assure 
them that the radiation level is normal in the entire territory 
of the Republic. I have information before me on the computer 
that at 0900 [0600 GMT] this morning there were 14 
microroentgens per hour in Minsk... 
  Awcharenka, interrupting: Let us review the norm. 
  Matveyenka: Naturally. Before the Chernobyl 
events, the gamma irradiation rate on the territory was 10-20 
(?microroentgens) per hour. Therefore, everything is within the 
normal limits. And, throughout the territory of Belarus, I can 
read [pauses]... in the region of Braslav -- 11 microroentgens, 
in Slutsk -- 16 microroentgens, in Marina Gorka -- 11 
microroentgen. Everything is within the normal limits. 
  Awcharenka: Thank you for such competent 
information. I will remind our listeners that we have phoned 
Ivan Ivanavich Matveyenka, head of the Republican Center of 
Radiation Control and Environmental Monitoring. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Inara Egle: "Greens Must Not Change Color: The </F>
5th Congress of the Latvian Green Party Discussed Party Identity 
and Elected Leaders."] 
  [Text] One year ago, when tactics for the Saeima elections 
were being discussed during the Green Party Congress, Dzintars 
Abikis, while still a member of the party at that time, 
attempted to convince his colleagues that by running on a 
separate ballot the Greens could experience major 
disappointments in the Saeima elections. In theory, it turned 
out that he was right, but it seems that what was gained or lost 
cannot be easily evaluated. At the 5th Congress of the Latvian 
Green Party (LGP), which was held Saturday, the present day 
Latvian Way-"farer", Dzintars Abikis did not participate (this 
does not mean he was not mentioned -- in both a positive and 
critical light). After re-registration of the party members as a 
political organization, the number of united Greens has declined 
from approximately 300 to 128 members, which is not that 
significant, considering that many parties, even the more 
popular ones, are in the same situation at present, numerically 
speaking. But, just as last year, the main question for the 
Congress was how the Greens, without losing their identity, 
could save their ability to influence the process and defend 
their interests, which is only possible through government 
structures. 
  As we know, in the municipal elections, the Green party, in 
the majority of cases, is running together with the national 
forces, and even in the Riga council elections, it has joined 
the ballot with the Latvian National Independence Movement 
(LNIM), and the Greens have 11 seats there -- they did not even 
want any more. Latvian Green Party Co-Chairman Peteris Jansons 
said that the situation and the goals are different now, 
bringing the national political forces closer together. As far 
as we can remember, the union of national forces was formed 
primarily to support Latvian interests with respect to the 
citizenship law, and now it is also protesting against the 
initialed documents of the Latvian and Russian talks. And these 
are matters, as we learned at the Congress, that the Greens are 
entrusting to their coalition partners. 
  But the question concerns something else: by approaching and 
assimilating with other national forces, will the Greens lose 
the ability to voice their own principles in a sufficiently loud 
manner? This is also the concern of the longtime party 
Co-Chairman, Juris Zvirgzds, who reminded everyone that only and 
by itself can the Green Party create political security for all 
priorities related to its work and the environment. And 
therefore, two matters cannot be confused -- Greens do not join 
with nor enter into another political power, but, instead, they 
work together with it as an equal partner. "I am for working 
together according to the principle of partner relationships, 
but I am against the case where a Green changes colors or allows 
environmental questions to be postponed to another time, some 
time later. We know that `later' never comes", said Juris 
Zvirgzds. 
  Maybe there is no need to be afraid, because the partners, 
according to the assessment of Indulis Emsis, respect Greens 
precisely for their convictions, and have also studied their 
principles. But, for this same reason, according to Indulis 
Emsis, a "green line" must be defined, which, when it is crossed 
over, will cause the LGP to leave the partnership and drop out 
of the game. It should also be respected that the realization of 
Green ideas requires a long period of time, and therefore it is 
unnecessary to make exaggerated attempts to become a ruling 
political power, but rather, to focus on such politics that the 
Green standpoint is mentioned by all political forces, said 
Emsis. He also mentioned the party's financial situation, 
because it is no secret to anyone that influence in a power 
structure can be gained only by those parties who have money. 
Greens do not have money, but in looking for it, they should 
continue to be on the alert, because there are more than just a 
few who would be willing to provide financial support for the 
party, but only on the condition that it renounces the Green 
lines and principles in specific instances. 
  Even though the question -- of whether to go alone or 
together with others --started some arguments, which, it seems, 
still remain unresolved, this did not, in any case, show signs 
of a split among the Greens. Maybe this was because there 
weren't that many of them -- not quite fifty. And maybe because, 
as Anna Seile concluded, this was a meeting hall where everyone 
could speak in a quiet tone, without microphones, and everyone 
understood and listened. And it is true that no calls to come to 
order were heard in the Green Congress, although when the 
candidates for party co-chairmen were proposed and 
characterized, an attendee summarized this process afterwards, 
asking: "Out of five angels, how can we select just three?" Yes, 
the Green Party still maintains the principle of electing, not 
one leader, but three co-chairmen to adopt their colleagues' 
resolutions, and so that the party is not called the Zvirgzds or 
Emsis party. This also has its minuses, which could be noticed 
also in the review period, because, since the functions are not 
precisely divided, it is also difficult to divide the 
responsibilities. It should be noted that none of these 
co-chairmen earn their living through being co-chairmen. 
  All three former party leaders -- Juris Zvirgzds, Olegs 
Batarevskis and Peteris Jansons -- were also nominated for the 
position this year. The bulletins also included the names of two 
more candidates -- the Environmental Protection Committee Vice 
President Pavils Raudonis, and Kuldiga rayon Council Chairman 
Janis Klavins. 
  Most votes in the Congress were received by the former party 
"prime mover", Juris Zvirgzds, head of the ecology laboratory at 
the Zoological Garden. Next was Janis Klavins, who could be 
considered as the surprise of this Congress. Klavins joined the 
party only one year ago, and ran as a Green candidate in the 
Saeima elections (in Kurzeme, as the very first). But the public 
began to notice Klavins when all attention was turned to 
Skrunda, which is in Janis Klavins led Kuldiga rayon. Like Olegs 
Batarevskis -- the third co-chairman -- he was born in 1951. O. 
Batarevskis works as State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice. 
The Central Council elected at the Congress will include Jekabs 
Raipulis, Leons Magelis, Inese Eihvalde, Indulis Emsis, Janis 
Baltvilks, Gunars Lakutis, Skaidrite Albertina, Pavils Raudonis 
and Karlis Gudermanis (Peteris Jansons withdrew his candidacy). 
  The delegates at the Congress also adopted one resolution, 
requesting the President of the nation to proclaim the first 
week of May as clean-up week. During this week, according to the 
document, "let's wash windows -- the eyes of Latvia, clean up 
courtyards and entryways."

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Shunevich: "The Tender for </F>
`Sarcophagus 2' Is Open"] 
  [Text] Currently, representatives of several firms -- the 
participants in a tender, opened last year by Ukraine and the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, for the best 
feasibility study of the project to transform the "tomb" housing 
the remnants of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant's fourth power 
unit into an ecologically safe facility -- are examining the 
situation at the plant. In Zelenyy Mys, the settlement of the 
plant's security guards, the Ukrainian side represented by the 
leaders and specialists from the State Committee for Nuclear 
Power Industry [Derzhkomatom], the Ministry for Chernobyl 
Issues, and the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences have 
explained to the guests the technical task on which the 
feasibility study of "Sarcophagus 2" construction should be 
based. Although the conversation, in which EC Envoy to Ukraine 
Louis Morren participated, was held behind closed doors, there 
was a presentation of the technical task. Its basic conditions 
are as follows: To build a new sarcophagus which would allow 
the continuation of research on the old one and its contents and 
the stabilization of the situation, to construct a nuclear waste 
storage, to sort out and reprocess nuclear waste, and to 
dismantle the old sarcophagus. The main issue here is the 
safety of people and environment. All this should not hamper 
the station's safe operation and its gradual closure. It has 
also been envisioned that Ukraine's industry and 
scientific-technical potential will be used in this process. 
  The last two conditions have become the most significant 
obstacle. The West is afraid of our instability, and it trusts 
neither the country's leadership nor our specialists. Nor does 
it want to continue the Chernobyl nuclear power plant's 
operation, indicating that after the plant is closed down, it 
will help to construct additional power units which would 
compensate for the closure, and it will build the "Shelter 2" 
itself. To put it briefly, the situation resembles that 
connected with Ukraine's nuclear weapons. By the way, the West 
does not put such pressure on Russia, which has many more less 
sophisticated RBMK reactors. 
  Asked by a KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI correspondent whether EC is 
planning to provide assistance to the constructors of the first 
sarcophagus and other people who suffered while liquidating the 
Chernobyl disaster aftermath, and whose health is much worse 
than that of their creation, and whether it is not better to 
allocate the funds the West intends to spend on closing the 
station for this purpose, Mr. Morren replied very evasively: 
"The international community should tackle all Chernobyl 
problems." His statement was expounded on by H. Hotovchyts, 
minister for Chernobyl issues, who led the presentation: "The 
EC Commission is helping us in many directions. This 
assistance, however, does not relate to social protection of 
those who suffered. Here, Ukraine is coping with its misery 
alone." 
  Derzhkomatom Chairman M. Umanets: "The Chernobyl nuclear 
power plant is a part of our state's nuclear power engineering 
system, without which our independence is impossible. The 
station is operating successfully, and nobody is more interested 
in closing it than Ukraine itself. Therefore, we should have 
the decisive voice. Yet, the Chernobyl plant can only be closed 
down after resolving all problems. We cannot allow ourselves to 
again deceive the station personnel." 
  S. Parashyn, Chernobyl nuclear power plant director general: 
"We are professionals, and the most important goal of our work 
is to improve safety. Nevertheless, political games surrounding 
this issue, as well as our uncertainty concerning the future, 
are hampering our safe work. We are tired of being a bargaining 
chip in someone's policy. Two commissions of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency have recently visited the station, and 
nobody said that it should be closed down. On the contrary, 
they noted that we are proceeding on the right path, and that 
there are no preconditions to stop the RBMK reactors. Having 
done that prematurely, Ukraine would lose hundreds of highly 
qualified specialists. It takes from seven to 10 years to train 
one such specialist." 
  Of course, there are also contradictory opinions among our 
specialists, and while this protracted debate continues, the 
following question is very much to the point: What is the real 
condition of the "Shelter 1"? Will it not tumble down as we 
keep talking? I addressed this question to Oleksiy Bytskyy, 
former general designer and current director of the Ukrainian 
National Academy of Sciences department of design-construction 
works of MNTTs [expansion unknown] "Shelter": 
  -- The current condition of the sarcophagus does not pose 
any 
threat, Oleksiy Andriyovych says. However, it is deteriorating, 
simply because everything in the world ages. There are not 
enough funds to service it; we are looking for them. It is 
unfortunate that the tender drags on. The "Shelter 2" should 
have been built as early as two or four years ago. I doubt that 
foreigners will build anything. This is nonsense, and the old 
sarcophagus will last another 30 years. 
  Well, shall we wait?

  [Text] Zaporozhye Oblast -- The government commission for 
the acceptance of generating set no. 6 as operational with its 
capacity rated at one million kilowatts, planned for 
commissioning in October, held a sitting at the Zaporozhye 
nuclear plant on 24 May. The commission united representatives 
of the State Committee for the Use of Nuclear Power, the Power 
Engineering and Electrification Ministry, the Environmental 
Protection Ministry, the State Committee for the Control of Work 
Safety in Nuclear Engineering, the fire protection directorate, 
and the sanitary and epidemiological service. 
  Mykhaylo Umanets, chairman of the State Committee for the 
Protection of Work Safety in Nuclear Engineering and official in 
charge of the government commission, has told a UNIAN 
correspondent: "This is the first time that the government 
commission has assembled since the moratorium on the development 
of nuclear power engineering in Ukraine was lifted in October 
1993. Under conditions of continuing recession in the economy, 
the launch of a new enterprise -- the one million-kilowatt 
nuclear power generating set -- is a splendid event. 
Representatives of controlling bodies have noted the high 
degree of the equipment's reliability and readiness for work, 
with 80 percent of it having already undergone trials in the 
operational mode. All the services have been fully manned with 
highly qualified personnel. A new-generation water-cooled 
water-moderated power reactor has been installed at the 
generating set. It meets international nuclear and radiation 
safety requirements and is equipped with additional automated 
emergency reactor protection and fire fighting systems." 
  Specialists from the National Control Center at Ukraine's 
Power Engineering and Electrification Ministry estimate that the 
electricity to be produced by the new generating set will make a 
substantial contribution to the state's single energy system.

<F P=106> [Article by Janni Andreassen: "Forest Owners Want To Burn </F>
Wastepaper"] 
  [Text] Energy: The Danish Forest Federation wants to burn 
old paper, which is accused of increasing CO[.sub]2[/] 
pollution and destroying the economic potential of forests. 
  Wood producers and the recycling industry are in strong 
disagreement over whether it should be permitted to burn 
wastepaper for energy purposes. 
  The Danish Forest Federation has come right out and said it: 
Burn the paper instead of increasing demand for recycled paper. 
There is quite enough of it on the market, a fact that is 
reflected in the price, which, roughly speaking, is next to 
nothing. A growing recycling industry is destructive of forests, 
which cannot dispose of new wood. And at the same time only 
recycled paper, through its production process, helps increase 
CO[.sub]2[/] emissions. 
  The paper industry in Denmark is also involved in the 
debate. 
Not surprisingly, it holds the opposite point of view. 
  In a letter to the minister for industry, the environment, 
and energy and the [Folketing standing] Committee on the 
Environment, Stora Papyrus Dalum, Inc., Skjern Papirfabrik, 
Inc., and Grenaa Papir, Inc. state that burning wastepaper would 
destroy the supply of wastepaper to the Danish paper industry. 
  The Liberal, Conservative, and Progressive Parties have 
proposed to the Folketing that the ban that has existed since 
1986, under which paper collected by cities and towns must not 
be used as an energy source, be lifted. That is to say, that it 
must not be burned. 
  The proposal has just had its first reading in the Folketing 
and has not been sent to the Committee on the Environment, and 
the Danish Forest Federation has asked to appear before it. 
<H5>  Recycling Paper Increases CO </H5>[.sub]2[/] Emissions 
  The Environment Administration has prepared a note on the 
issue that shows the advantages and disadvantages of burning 
paper. Among other things, it looks at when there is increased 
recycling the consumption of fossil fuels and thus 
CO[.sub]2[/] emissions increases. 
  "This squares with both common sense and foreign analyses. 
On 
the other hand, it does not square well with Danish 
environmental policy to prohibit an energy source that could cut 
down on the repercussions of the greenhouse effect by using 
fossil fuels," said Martin Einfeldt, who works in the 
information department at the Danish Forest Federation. 
  He pointed out that in its note the Environment 
Administration makes the proposal to rescue scrap paper's 
CO[.sub]2[/] record: namely by using the wood, which the 
forests are saving, for energy purposes. 
  "They came up with that idea out of the blue. At the moment 
Europe's forests are experiencing a growth rate that is 50 
percent greater than the cutting rate, so the tree surplus is 
growing by 200 million cubic meters per year," Einfeldt said. 
  The paper industry has told the Environment Committee that 
it 
is not able to use new wood as a raw material either 
technologically, economically, or on the market. The industry is 
set up to use wastepaper and cannot help the forest industry out 
of the crisis it is in owing to a shortage of sales 
opportunities. 
<H5>  Analysis Not Good </H5>
  "In its note on recycling, the Environmental Administration 
is hinting indirectly against burning and depositing that the 
analysis cannot be used as a basis for making a decision in the 
Folketing. The Danish Forest Federation is entirely in agreement 
with this point of view," Einfeldt said. 
  Environment Minister Svend Auken has so far rejected the 
need 
to change the current law pertaining to burning in the waste 
sector.

  [Text] The fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear plant 
accident eight years ago is still evident in Finland. A survey 
covering southern Finland carried out by plane a few weeks ago 
revealed regions where radioactivity in the area is still 
surprisingly high. In addition, there were smaller regions, 
including Myrskylae and Kuhmoinen, where cesium 137 was found in 
quantities of 200 kilo- becquerels per square kilometer. These 
amounts are not dangerous for humans even though they are 
conspicuously high. Levels of 560 kilo-becquerels would demand 
protective measures.

<F P=106> ["Ph. E." report: "Nuclear Accidents: Franco-Russian </F>
Simulation"] 
  [Text] At a time when shutting down the Chernobyl power 
station is once again in the news because of Ukrainian blackmail 
aimed at ensuring its closure, the French and Russians have just 
engaged in the simulation of a large-scale disaster of the same 
type as that of Chernobyl. The objective was to test, with the 
help of the French Nuclear Protection and Safety Institute 
(IPSN), the Russian organization in the sphere of protecting 
populations and administering contaminated areas in the case of 
radioactive contamination of extensive areas. The former Soviet 
Union's experience is unique in this sphere with the nuclear 
disasters of Chelyabinsk in 1958 and Chernobyl in 1986. 
  The exercise, which required one year's preparation, was 
held 
from 21 to 25 June 1993 in the Kaluga region, a Russian 
territory already strongly affected by the effects of the 
Chernobyl explosion. The scenario and the facts are, moreover, 
directly inspired by the Ukrainian tragedy and the reaction of 
the local public authorities and the population at the time. 
Representatives of the administration, experts, representatives 
of the population and the media took part in the operation. 
They had to face the problems which arise not only immediately 
after the accident but also 16 days, then one year, and five 
years afterwards. A satellite link with the IPSN center in 
Fontenay-aux-Roses enabled French experts to participate 
directly in the operation. 
  The analysis of the results of the experiment, which was 
carried out last week, demonstrated the split which exists among 
the three main protagonists, namely the experts, the 
administration, and the media. The first complaint in 
particular of not always being heeded by civil servants who, 
often fearing panic among the population and the spread of 
rumors, tend to do nothing. This response is found again in 
their relations with the media. The French and Russians were 
able to broadly examine their decisionmaking processes, and 
their crisis management techniques, an exercise which was 
sufficiently productive for the two partners to decide to repeat 
the experiment in summer 1995 in Chelyabinsk, the other 
unfortunately famous site of the Soviet nuclear industry.

<F P=106> [Article by Charlotte Ruck: "Legislation Goes Marching On"] </F>
  [Text] About 50,000 derelict, polluted industrial sites 
have been identified to date in eastern and western Germany. 
Although the plots of ground concerned often constitute prime 
inner-city sites, the local authorities usually seek investors 
in vain. The risk of acquiring a plot that conceals an old dump 
is much too great. The ensuing costs would be incalculable. 
  This dilemma is particularly great in the new federal 
laender. Local authorities are under enormous pressure to 
attract investors to create jobs and raise tax revenue. 
However, as the derelict sites are unsalable, business areas 
are springing up all over the place in green belts. As a 
result, the landscape is being unnecessarily spoiled, despite 
the fact that areas with full infrastructure facilities are 
already available. 
<H5>  Special Attention </H5>
  For this reason, the derelict site issue is receiving 
special 
attention, particularly in the new federal laender. The local 
and land-level authorities are pressing on with both the 
identification and hazard assessment of likely areas and their 
reclamation. For instance, Thuringia has had a law on waste 
management and derelict sites since as early as 1991. 
  It is also expected that the law on investment incentives 
and 
residential building land, which came into force on 1 May 1993, 
will also give a major boost. Operators of dump reclamation 
facilities can hope for simpler, speedier licensing procedures. 
Indeed, the last few months have seen a boom in the 
establishment of new stationary soil conditioning facilities, 
particularly in the new federal laender. 
<H5>  Simplified Licensing </H5>
  According to Hamburg-based Nordac, which examined the 
consequences of the law on investment incentives at a symposium 
held in November 1993, there are currently over 150 facilities 
with annual capacities ranging from 3,000 to 200,000 tonnes at 
the planning or licensing stage, under construction, or already 
in operation. 
  The law on mobile polluted site conditioning plants is 
making 
a particularly strong impact. Although these plants were 
subject to just as comprehensive a licensing procedure as the 
stationary facilities before the law was amended, they are now 
exempt from licensing if they are operated for less than 12 
months on the same site. 
  The specialists hope that the simplified licensing procedure 
will bring an increase in the number of reclamations completed. 
At the very least, there ought to be a move away from 
containment toward decontamination measures. However, fears are 
being voiced in the skeptics' camp that the mobile plant market 
will become increasingly crowded with suppliers whose systems 
are less than state-of-the-art. 
  It was expected that increasing competition would lower 
prices, but as high-performance systems would necessarily cost 
more than, for instance, plants with a lower conditioning 
capacity and/or minimum air and effluent treatment functions, 
overall quality would fall. Air exhaust and effluent 
conditioning systems often accounted for two-thirds of 
stationary plants, explained a Nordac spokesman at the symposium. 
  The state of the art and the degree to which it has been 
adopted vary in Germany. Soil conditioning plants, 15 of which 
are currently operating throughout the Federal Republic, present 
an advanced level of development, but the situation with thermal 
plants is quite different: To date, there is only one trial 
plant running in the whole of Germany. Other countries are 
further ahead in this field, the Netherlands, for instance, 
having several plants in operation. As numerous licenses for 
thermal plants are currently pending, experts assume that this 
technology will soon be available in Germany as well. 
  The state of the art for biological processes is well 
defined, particularly for on-site processes, although 
disillusionment is spreading as to on-site reclamation 
strategies -- those not involving the removal of soil -- say 
insiders. The scope for using these processes is proving 
limited. 
<H5>  Clearly Defined Ceilings Called For </H5>
  Even more than simplified licensing procedures for 
reclamation plants, clearly defined ceilings for soil 
contaminants are being called for. The lack of certainty as to 
how far a reclamation project has to go is a major factor in 
discouraging many people from even considering a project of this 
type. The regulations on soil conservation are currently 
scattered over several areas of legislation (e.g. laws on water, 
air, and waste disposal). In addition, some laender have their 
own statutory regulations on polluted sites. 
  Great hopes are being vested in the soil conservation bill 
currently being drafted, the purpose of which will be to 
conserve the soil in its multiplicity of functions, to safeguard 
it against hazardous modifications, to remedy damage that has 
already been done, and to prevent such damage from affecting 
mankind and the environment. A comprehensive range of 
procedures for conditioning polluted sites is also envisaged. 
<H5>  Basis for Technical Directive on Soil </H5>
  However, the primary purpose of the law is to create the 
prerequisites for incorporating soil conservation requirements 
into statutory orders and administrative provisions. In 
particular, the law will form the basis for the Technical 
Directive on Soil, in which binding values will be laid down for 
the soil, with regulations on prevention and hazard aversion to 
the fore. Today's large number of lists of soil ceiling values 
will thus be replaced by a single, nationwide system of rules. 
  An inventory of various assessment aids and recommendations 
for treating contaminated soils has been commissioned by a 
Laender Waste Management Association working party. It emerges 
from this inventory that recommended soil values are currently 
largely set with reference to the purposes for which the land is 
used and the resources to be preserved. 
  Based on significance and function, experts from the Ruhr 
District's Institute of Hygiene in Gelsenkirchen differentiate 
between: 
  -- Background values: Generally widespread or typical 
regional pollutant concentrations in soils outside actual or 
suspected polluted sites; 
  -- Test values: Concentration values in excess of which 
further investigations are required, but below which the hazard 
risk may be regarded as negligible; 
  -- Critical values: Maximum concentrations that must not be 
exceeded, as individual cases may present an intolerable level 
of risk in particular circumstances; in the event of these 
values being exceeded, the type and extent of salvage measures 
and reclamation methods must be decided without delay; 
  -- Reclamation target values: Maximum concentrations for 
soils to be achieved on site using salvage and reclamation 
measures, and wherever possible to be further reduced; 
  -- Incorporation values: Quality criteria/maximum 
concentrations for soils to be incorporated or reincorporated 
into multiple-use areas. 
  In addition to drawing up the actual values, great emphasis 
is placed on clearly defining the concepts and on implementing 
the recommended values (specifications for sampling and analysis 
procedures, for instance). There is still a considerable need 
for coordination in establishing the figures for various types 
of ground use. 
<H5>  Far-Reaching Ideas </H5>
  It emerged clearly from the "Environmental Conservation 
Forum," which the Rhineland Technical Monitoring Board organized 
in Cologne at the beginning of October 1993, that this is not 
all that the representatives of the laender expect of the law on 
soil conservation. Dr. Hans-Joachim Pietrzeniuk, representing 
the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia, stressed the need to create 
a full range of facilities for assessing and treating polluted 
soil; a soil information system, soil pollution maps, and areas 
scheduled for long-term monitoring should all be considered. 
  The laender's main hope is that financing mechanisms will be 
introduced at federal level for measures for which specific 
responsibility cannot be apportioned. In view of the federal 
and land governments' empty coffers, this could give rise to a 
dispute that will be difficult to settle in the near future. 
However, if areas are to be made rapidly available for 
investors, particularly in the new federal laender, solutions 
for financing the requisite reclamation work must be found at an 
early date.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans-W. Wichert: "Old Liabilities -- New Tasks: </F>
Criteria for Reclamation"] 
  [Text] The problems surrounding polluted sites in the new 
federal laender may be seen as the major obstacle to the sale of 
the old factories with a view to creating new jobs. However, it 
is important to differentiate between the various types and 
degrees of pollution and the future uses to which it is intended 
to put the sites concerned. 
  For the purposes of polluted site reclamation -- and this 
does not apply solely to the new federal laender -- a 
distinction will have to be drawn between the general principle 
of prevention and that of salvaging in order to conserve the 
soil as a natural entity and the foundation for human, animal, 
and plant life. Unless this distinction is clearly drawn, there 
will be a danger that prevention standards will be applied to 
operations designed to remedy existing soil pollution. This 
would result in an enormous outlay and gigantic reclamation 
costs. 
<H5>  Typical Polluted Site Problems </H5>
  It is not only the special cases of former industrial areas, 
such as those containing coking works, gasworks, refineries, 
etc., that present problems. Polluted sites are often to be 
found at factories producing products above suspicion of 
contamination, but which merely used (apparently small 
quantities of) substances represent a water hazard. 
  In most of these cases, only part (often under 20 percent) 
of 
the site is contaminated and needs to be cleaned up. Plant 
sections such as former dyeing units, sedimentation tanks, 
residue deposits (factory dumps), drum stores, heating boilers, 
etc. are the main parts affected. In all these cases it is to 
be expected that the soil will have been polluted by slag 
containing heavy metals, petroleum products, phenols, 
chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHC's), and creosotes (polynuclear 
aromatic hydrocarbons). All these pollutants are to be found in 
the soil in varying concentrations, and can spread down to great 
depths, for instance in troughs, hollows, and gutters and over 
wide areas. 
  It often emerges in practice that the reclamation strategies 
drawn up at the beginning have to be changed into use-oriented 
versions without reference to the former factory. Multifunction 
use of the type frequently called for in the early eighties 
cannot be achieved. It is unrealistic to assume that the entire 
mass of soil can be cleansed to a degree of purity reflecting 
its natural state. 
  In addition to the nature of the substance concerned, the 
path by which it spreads plays a decisive role in determining 
the hazard that it constitutes for human beings, animals, 
plants, and the environment. Chemical degradation combined with 
volubility in water can endanger the groundwater, whereas 
volatile substances also take an aerial path. It is only via 
knowledge as to how the substances are spread that it can be 
established whether they place the various resources at risk. 
  If a substance in the soil may be regarded as persistent, it 
has zero effect on the groundwater and/or human beings provided 
it remains below the ground surface but at a sufficient distance 
from the groundwater. The situation is quite different if a 
substance in the soil is rapidly degradable. 
  This has major implications for reclamation technology, as 
it 
may be assumed that processes take place in nature in accordance 
with the law of minimum, i.e., with the minimum economic outlay. 
<H5>  Developing the Right Criteria </H5>
  A major issue, especially in the new federal laender, will 
be 
the elaboration of criteria that distinguish between the 
differing conservation targets for avoiding contamination either 
on a preventive basis or as a salvage measure. Without doubt, 
reclamation targets frequently call for the lower preventive 
level, not least in view of the legal uncertainty facing the 
licensing authorities. 
  Taking a realistic view of the overall situation -- 
particularly with an eye to stretching limited resources -- 
every attempt should be made to explore alternative strategies 
that make it possible to release parts of the factory sites so 
that they can be put to new uses.

  [Text] Three projects, for which the Federal Ministry of 
Research and Technology (BMFT) has granted funding, will take on 
a pilot role for other reclamation plans. About 25 million 
German marks [DM] will be spent on developing and testing 
reclamation processes for use on heavily contaminated soil at 
the former Buna chemicals combine, the Ilsenburg copper mill, 
and the Zichow hazardous waste dump. 
  Approximately DM19 million are earmarked for the Buna 
project, where the main emphasis is on dealing with high 
concentrations of mercury contamination. In addition to 
developing and testing analysis and surveying methods for use in 
hazard assessment, the team will work out 
environment-compatible, economically viable methods for 
demolishing the buildings and machinery. A representative 
quantity of contaminated material and soil will also be 
reconditioned in the course of the project. 
  The second pilot project is the Ilsenburg copper mill, which 
is contaminated with a high level of heavy metals, dioxins, and 
furans, as is the area surrounding it. An initial DM4.2 million 
will be spent in the first stage on developing reliable 
processes for decontaminating factory buildings that cannot be 
demolished in the normal way. 
  The third site is the "Great Zichow Hollow," a sink still in 
use as late as 1989 as a hazardous waste dump for solid, 
viscous, and fluid waste. As it has no underseal, it poses a 
hazard to the groundwater and the surrounding drinking water 
conservation area. In addition to securing the sink to avert 
this danger, the first phase of the project will draw up a 
strategy for decontaminating the solid and fluid waste. The 
second phase will cover a partial reclamation of the dump by a 
combination of various methods.

<F P=106> [Article by Kathrin Hoffmann and Bertram Heimlich: "Like </F>
the Phoenix Rising From Its Ashes -- A Modern Industrial Estate 
Born in Bitterfeld"] 
  [Text] Where the chimneys of 92 factories once belched out 
evil-smelling smoke in the old days of the GDR [German 
Democratic Republic], a modern industrial estate will now be 
born, a showpiece example of reclamation and redevelopment of a 
large-scale derelict, polluted industrial site. Ultramodern 
production facilities for the chemical and other industries are 
being built in Bitterfeld on the site formerly occupied by the 
chemical combines. 
<H5>  Bitterfeld/Wolfen Well Surveyed </H5>
  The Federal Government and the Land of Saxony-Anhalt spent 
270 million German marks [DM] on the environmental reclamation 
of the Bitterfeld/Wolfen area up to the end of 1992 alone. 
"This is now probably the best surveyed area in the whole of 
Germany," says Volker Eisewicht of Bisantech Chemical 
Engineering and Reclamation Bitterfeld GmbH, the Preussag AG and 
Chemicals AG Bitterfeld-Wolfen joint venture that has been 
engaged in consulting and engineering work on the site since 
1991. Its work also includes the planning of the 
Bitterfeld-Wolfen municipal sewage treatment plant, which is 
being built on the edge of the industrial estate. 
  The firm, which was formed from Chemicals AG in 1991, 
employs 
a staff with first-hand knowledge of the chemical works and 
their former output, an advantage that has paid dividends. 
  The sewage works will not treat only the effluent from the 
future industrial estate but will receive input from the sewers 
of the 26 municipalities making up the Lower Mulde and Wolfen 
sewage treatment consortia. Four high-level bioreactors of 
sealed tank design will purify the water, and their compactness 
means that considerably less space will be taken up than is 
usually the case. The new plant is designed in three stages, 
including biological after purification and sludge draining. In 
addition to a prepurification stage for effluent containing 
dyes, the sewage works has a simultaneous activated carbon 
adsorption system for substances that are not readily degradable 
and a simultaneous phosphate elimination unit. 
<H5>  Reclaimed Areas for Redevelopment </H5>
  Right next to the sewage treatment works, Bayer is building 
a 
total of five production facilities. Europe's largest 
pharmaceuticals factory and one paint and one methylcellulose 
factory are scheduled to go into production before the end of 
the current year. However, the site had previously been cleaned 
up at the state's expense. Bisantech played a major role in the 
planning and supervision of this project as well. 
  The gigantic survey program carried out on the factory site 
and in the surrounding area to locate the dumps immediately 
after unification came in handy. As Eisewicht says, "Sample 
drillings and analyses were performed over the areas according 
to a specific grid." Old records were subsequently assessed in 
the search for missed pockets or old dumps. The industrial 
waste was then studied thoroughly, and aerial photographs were 
evaluated as well. 
  Although only selected areas required reclamation on the 
site 
taken over by Bayer, redevelopment was no easy matter. "The 
mains that supply the whole complex with cooling and service 
water from the Mulde water works ran straight across the 
building site and had to be replaced with kilometers of pipes. 
An old, open sewer also had to be cased," says Eisewicht. 
Deposits of demonstrably nonhazardous waste were removed to a 
regulation dump. The perimeter area bordering on the former dye 
works also presented problems, as no detailed information about 
it was available. 
<H5>  Interim Soil Storage </H5>
  Analyses performed as the building work progressed ensured 
that the work proceeded smoothly. "Contaminated soil was 
removed and is being stored pending completion of the planned 
disposal and reprocessing center," says Eisewicht of the interim 
solution. Leveling the site's irregular terrain and, above all, 
the immense pressure of time, added to the problems. 
  Whereas the sewage works and the new Bayer buildings are not 
being erected on areas on which production facilities once 
stood, as many of the other incoming industrial companies as 
possible are scheduled to occupy dismantled sites. The 
buildings were tested both inside and out, and the surrounding 
areas surveyed prior to demolition, after which Bisantech, in 
conjunction with the Environment Office and Chemicals AG, drew 
up a disposal and reprocessing strategy for the complex, laying 
particular stress on the reprocessing of the demolition rubble. 
<H5>  Dismantling by Stages Possible </H5>
  The chemical plants are currently being dismantled by 
stages. 
Eisewicht takes the lime-ammonium nitrate plant as an example to 
describe the process: The production plant was first dismantled 
up to the upper perimeter of the site, followed by the other 
facilities, such as the warehouse, rail tracks, and roads. This 
in turn is being followed by the complete dismantling of the 
underground systems to a depth of 2.5 meters. 
  As much as possible of the hazardous waste that accumulates 
during the reclamation work will be reconditioned or disposed of 
on site, so it is planned to set up a modern disposal and 
reconditioning center with physicochemical treatment and 
hazardous waste incineration facilities on the reclaimed land 
occupied by Chemicals AG. For the time being, an immobilization 
process is being used to render heavily polluted soil reusable. 
  All this preliminary work on the site of the future 
industrial estate is creating incentives for potential 
investors. As a location, Bitterfeld-Wolfen is now offering 
more and more facilities that will encourage further companies 
to move in. In addition to Bayer, other famous names have 
already taken up residence, including Heraeus Quartz Glass, a 
company that produces optical fibers for telecommunication 
cables. Ultraclean production conditions are absolutely 
essential for the manufacture of optical fiber cables, so this 
is yet another sign of the enormous improvement in Bitterfeld's 
image. 
  Volker Eisewicht reckons that the bulk of the work on the 
whole site will be completed in five years at the most, by which 
time a gigantic mechanism combining dismantling and reclamation 
will have completely changed the face and the character of the 
area. It will be exciting to see if the costly efforts on the 
part of the Federal Government, the Land of Saxony-Anhalt, and 
the firms involved will not only benefit Bitterfeld itself as a 
location but will serve as a model for other areas.

  [Text] Wherever extractive reclamation methods come up 
against technical and economic limits, immobilization processes 
nevertheless make it possible to put polluted areas to new uses. 
This is especially true in cases of multiple contamination with 
hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy 
metals on land rich in coarse clay, and of widespread pollution 
in industrial areas. Immobilization using a binding agent will 
also make it possible to recycle large expanses of the heavily 
polluted Bitterfeld industrial area, where an on-site hazardous 
waste incineration plant is to be built once safeguards are in 
place. 
  In May last year, work began on digging out soil, backfill, 
and rubble containing heavy metals and dioxins on the 
10.5-hectare [26- acre] Chemicals AG site. By the end of 
December 1993, the Nuernberg-based reclamation company, PBS, had 
dug out about 50,000 cubic meters of material and immobilized 
32,000 cubic meters. The material is first homogenized then 
immobilized in a charge mixer. The soil and binding agent are 
weighed out electronically and precisely proportioned for this 
purpose. A mixing throughput of up to 1,000 cubic meters a day 
can be handled. 
  The immobilized soil is reincorporated into a controllable 
system that is separated from the unpolluted soil by a dividing 
layer. Samples of both the untreated and the reincorporated soil 
are taken and analyzed during the reclamation work.

  [Text] Soil contamination with combinations of toxic 
substances, such as hydrocarbons and heavy metals, often present 
major problems. Low-cost biological reclamation processes are 
ruled out in most cases, and all that remains are costly soil 
washing or heat treatments or dumping. 
  Markkleeberg-based Biolipsia GmbH has developed a gentle 
two-stage process for this area. In the first stage, the 
adsorption agent Metasorb B is added and thoroughly mixed into 
the soil material, which is ground down to grain sizes of less 
than 20 mm. All the heavy metal ions present -- even chromium -- 
are securely bound, and after a reaction period ranging from a 
few hours to a few days, hardly any bioavailable heavy metal 
ions remain in the material. This process is irreversible over 
a very wide pH range. 
<H5>  Biological Degradation in Biobeds </H5>
  In the second stage, the organic contamination can be 
eliminated in biobeds. The pretreatment has bound all the heavy 
metals to the extent that they have no inhibiting effect on the 
enzymatic activity of the bacteria that degrade the 
hydrocarbons. Other nutrients required for pollutant 
degradation, such as alkaline or earth-alkaline ions and 
phosphoric and nitrogenous salts, are not bound by the 
adsorption agent. 
  The company has performed successful laboratory tests over 
the last few weeks, where adding Metasorb in a ratio of five to 
10 percent by volume of the soil being treated achieved 
degradation rates ranging from 35 to 85 percent of the initial 
concentrations after a 15-hour mixing period followed by the 
degradation test -- with prefermented biomass over 24 hours. 
The producer's initial findings indicate that the process is 
economically viable, as the cost per tonne is only DM25 to DM80 
higher than with purely microbiological processes. 
  If biobed treatment is prolonged sufficiently, the 
hydrocarbon concentrations can be reduced to the extent that the 
material can be used for reincorporation. Long-term trials in 
Belgium have shown that no discharge of heavy metals into 
groundwater-bearing strata need be feared.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rudolf Scharping, SPD chairman and minister </F>
president of Rhineland-Palatinate; and Joschka Fischer, Greens 
deputy and environmental minister of Hesse, by Thomas Hanke and 
Fritz Vorholz; date and place not given: "You Have To Say What 
Is Important"] 
  [Text] DIE ZEIT: Mr. Scharping, have we 
understood you correctly? You said you want to struggle for 
"ecologically honest prices" and an "economic and ecological 
reorientation of the tax system," and you have also said that 
"the costs of mobility must reflect the costs of environmental 
damage." 
  Scharping: Yes. Then there will be no constant 
development without ecological progress. 
  DIE ZEIT: We are basing our question on 
quotations from the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] basic 
program. 
  Scharping: That does not matter. The CDU makes 
unscrupulous use of definitions. If one wants to understand CDU 
policies, one must pay attention to results, and ignore the 
practice of playing about with definitions. 
  DIE ZEIT: I take it that if you become chancellor 
you will combine the combating of unemployment with the 
ecological revival of the economy? 
  Scharping: That is correct. It will include a 
modernization of the state's social spheres. 
  DIE ZEIT: You, Mr. Fischer, have described the SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany] program as "Green 
cosmetics." Why? 
  Scharping: If the SPD wants an ecological 
restructuring, that is certainly praiseworthy and good. But we 
will have to see whether the government assumes responsibility 
for this. That is the problem. 
  DIE ZEIT: But before we indulge in a political 
dispute, I would like to say what this country really needs, and 
I simply cannot imagine how one can create the required number 
of jobs without investing major funds in an expansion of the 
transportation system or energy supply. These funds will have to 
be consumed, and society will have to be told about this. 
  Scharping: There is a major difference between the 
SPD and the Greens. We say that the level of taxation to be 
reached in 1995 must not go any higher. 
  Fischer: I agree. We are united on that issue. 
  Scharping: In that case you have to explain how, 
apart from the 10 percent supplementary tax, you intend to 
include the investment aid levy, labor market levy, increase in 
capital transfer tax, property tax, capital gains tax, crude oil 
tax, living space tax, speculation tax, tax on increased 
property value, and packaging levy in your concept. The Greens 
are saying virtually nothing about the SPD's wish to balance out 
these expenses. 
  Fischer: Wrong. When we talk about additional tax 
burdens, we must examine shifts in the tax balance, not 
additional quantities of taxes. The tax we want to impose on 
raw material and energy consumption must of course be gradually 
balanced out in the form of improved services, or by a reduction 
in income-related taxes. 
  Scharping: The SPD program is extraordinarily 
specific concerning ecological measures and concerning ways of 
relieving incomes of the tax burden and easing the tax burden of 
enterprises that are undertaking investments. Examples are tax 
exemption on the lowest incomes, a uniform child benefit of 250 
marks per month and per child, and an abolition of Kohl's 
solidarity tax supplement, instead of which an extra tax could 
be imposed on the first 20 percent of one's income. That would 
increase and strengthen growth. We want to create jobs and 
reduce wage-related costs, in this way making a serious effort 
at relieving the burden on employment and increasing the burden 
on raw materials and energy consumption. On the other hand, the 
Greens program is doing nothing except causing a new ecological 
debate. 
  Fischer: I admit our party congress did not 
discuss a specific adaptation to the finance concept. We did 
not intend to discuss it in any case. But the SPD also seems 
not to have examined this topic comprehensively. It seems to 
have given it merely a cursory examination. The situation will 
look quite different when an onslaught on the state's coffers is 
finally made and the financial realities are spelled out in Bonn. 
  But it is quite wrong to believe that we have not said 
anything on the subject of tax relief. For instance, we want to 
balance out the capital gains tax by means of adjustments to 
other taxes. In this point I think we are more honest. 
  Scharping: But the Constitutional Court must 
provide a guideline before then. Our program states that we 
cannot impose a bigger tax burden on used assets and on 
pensions. Neither can we increase tax on owner-occupied 
accommodation. 
  But the main point of economic and ecological development is 
the need to release the forces of growth in Germany. That can 
only succeed if enterprises have clear conditions that they can 
rely on, conditions that are not bureaucratic and do not inhibit 
a product-oriented environmental protection. But that will not 
work if we keep getting new signals for new tax burdens. 
  Fischer: I see no reason to object. These new 
signals, primarily signals for investments, must be 
green-oriented, so that new environmentally-friendly jobs can be 
created. Then I too will be ready to help abolish the 
bureaucracy surrounding environmental legislation. 
  DIE ZEIT: Mr. Scharping, basically the SPD also 
wants to change the price traffic lights to green. But your 
program conceals real intention behind the statement 
"appropriate measures." That is very vague. 
  Scharping: On the contrary. We have said very 
clearly that the consumption of energy and raw materials must be 
made more expensive. But since the Maastricht treaty, we no 
longer have the possibility of implementing our own energy 
taxation. This now has to be decided on a European level. 
  DIE ZEIT: Our research has provided us with a 
different answer. There is no real ban on implementing our own 
tax. 
  Scharping: Yes there is. In any case, the German 
economy's international bearing is stronger than that of the 
other major economies, and one cannot support Europe politically 
while retaining an economy that is only geared internally. 
  Fischer: Rudolf, the European Union does not stop 
you taking the lead, and that does not mean one is a 
nationalist. You seem to be hiding behind Europe, just like the 
present Federal Government. 
  Scharping: On the contrary. 
  Fischer: And I do not think we can seriously 
restructure the environment after energy prices have become more 
expensive. European electricity prices are moving in a sort of 
channel. I think we should travel along the top of this channel 
in order to create pressure leading to a greater efficiency of 
new technologies. That is also the idea behind establishing the 
price of gasoline to five marks per liter. No one among us has 
said that we want to raise gasoline prices to this level 
immediately. 
  Scharping: In the first year, a liter of gasoline 
should go up by 50 pfennigs, and in subsequent years 30 pfennigs 
annually. 
  Fischer: We gradually want to raise crude oil 
taxes, in order to finance the development of an energy-saving 
automobile. That is the main objective. At the same time, we 
want to use these funds to develop local transportation systems. 
On the other hand, I consider your views half-hearted. You know 
very well that if you are serious about your slogan of "work, 
work, work," you have to proceed in this direction. But you 
obviously do not have the courage to say so right now. 
  Scharping: You are not going to make this idea any 
more correct by constantly repeating it. As far as energy 
prices are concerned, we are quite near the top of the European 
table. A global market can no longer be financed out of German 
state resources alone. I consider it naive and dangerous to 
think that it can. 
  Ecological modernization is the human-friendly way to the 
future. It is a political and technological challenge, and not a 
bureaucratic straitjacket. At the same time, this is one of the 
growth markets of the future. One must convince others about 
this. 
  DIE ZEIT: When will you convince the European 
partners? 
  Scharping: There are enough objectives we can 
implement independently. In the construction sphere, we want to 
draw attention to ecological aspects. Electricity can be 
generated from recycled energy sources, and thus relieved of 
tax. We want to improve storage facilities for this type of 
electricity, and we want to encourage the use of solar energy in 
our "100,000 Roofs Program." In this sphere of environmental 
progress alone, the SPD has come out with over 30 very specific 
suggestions that I fail to see among the Greens. This is 
national policy that only we can implement. It is 
scientifically future-oriented and environmentally wise, and it 
will create jobs. 
  Fischer: The main problem is the prices of energy. 
Even the "100,000 Roofs Program" will not help much unless 
recyclable energy sources are economically viable. What I miss 
in the entire debate is a determination to proceed with a 
thorough renewal, for example a decision to solve traffic 
problems in conurbations in the course of 20 years, or turn 
Germany into a leading nation in the use of solar energy. If 
there were a second railroad revolution or a breakthrough in 
energy economization, you would certainly get your new jobs. 
But you must have the courage to set the financial points in 
such a way that the train travels in the right direction. 
  DIE ZEIT: Until now, Germany has performed quite 
well with its leading cost-effective environmental policy. 
  Scharping: Careful. It is true that we are 
number one in the world concerning industrial smoke filtering, 
water filtering, and removal of waste. But I fear we are 
threatened with a delay in development because until now we have 
concentrated almost exclusively on the environment. In Japan, 
on the other hand, the government, industry, and science are all 
involved in what is known as "ecolution," that is a combination 
of ecology and evolution. In the United States there are 
similar initiatives -- not just in the sphere of "information 
highways," but also in the "clear car" concept. With the 
government acting as anchorman, the experiences of science, 
industry, and research are brought together in order, for 
example, to produce cars that consume less fuel. Therefore in 
Germany, too, we must redirect our steps so as not to miss this 
opportunity. 
  DIE ZEIT: For this purpose, the SPD has suggested 
a "Forum of Future-Oriented Products." Mr. Fischer obviously 
has grater trust in price signals. 
  Fischer: So does Rudolf Scharping. If he pauses 
to examine the consequences of what he is saying, he will go 
further than the mere idea of producing a fuel-efficient car. 
The price of gasoline is presently 1.50 German marks per liter, 
about the same as at the end of the 1950's and the beginning of 
the 1960's when one ignores inflation. In any case, I am quite 
prepared to talk to him about the speed with which the price of 
gasoline should increase. I do not understand why the SPD is so 
afraid to discuss this. 
  Scharping: You are underplaying people's 
acceptance of an ecological reform policy. You will never gain 
support for a policy aimed at increasing the price of gasoline 
by 50 pfennigs next year, just as you will never make people 
believe that nuclear energy can be given up in one or two years. 
That is utter nonsense. 
  Fischer: Your idea about reducing the speed limit 
is just as nonsensical. To bring speed limits in line with the 
rest of Europe... 
  Scharping: We have not done that. We have said: 
A reduction in the speed limit to 130 kmh on 90 percent of 
German freeways, in keeping with EU recommendations... 
  Fischer: But Germany is the only country without 
a general speed limit. This makes as much sense as the 
statement of ours that you keep on quoting. 
  DIE ZEIT: Mr. Scharping, is it possible that you 
do not trust the voters? 
  Scharping: The voters are much wiser than some 
propagandists think. But in Germany there is a shortage of at 
least five million competitive jobs, two million people are 
looking for affordable accommodation, and 1 million children are 
being brought up with social security benefits. No progress can 
be achieved in Germany if one pursues the slogan "More Tax and 
More Bureaucracy." Therefore we must open the road to growth, 
or else there will be no boom, no permanent jobs, and no stable 
state finances. I also wish to win majority support for a 
triple reform idea -- a socially strong, socially just, and an 
ecologically modern Germany. 
  Fischer: We will see what happens about majority 
support. But as far as the diagnosis is concerned, I see nothing 
wrong. However, the mass unemployment, the enormous costs of 
unification, the missing kindergarten places, the necessary 
educational expenses, and the costs of the environmental 
restructuring have brought us to a point where we just tell the 
people: The high level of consumption of the 1980's cannot be 
maintained because of the drastically rising state debts under 
the Kohl/Waigel government, and because we need additional funds 
to safeguard the future. Therefore I think it is a good idea to 
say before the elections what is the most important thing. 
  Scharping: You must say what is important. You 
are talking not of restructuring, but of increases. Let me tell 
you this. If the Greens suggest a tax on the size of 
accommodation, and raise the tax on property and crude oil and 
introduce an additional tax... 
  Fischer: I had better keep quiet after the public 
row you have caused. 
  Scharping: That is why I am asking. When you 
carry out all your plans and work out how much they cost, you 
will realize that a typical family with two children in a 
Frankfurt suburb will never be able to make ends meet. You 
Greens can never reimburse with benefits what you demand in the 
form of levies. 
  Fischer: That is childish. I would not want to see 
a worker's family with two children earning a mere 3,500 marks 
per month. But one cannot avoid considering a fairer 
distribution of burdens. He who can afford more should pay 
more, for I am convinced that a greater burden has to be borne 
in order to combat unemployment. 
  Scharping: Joschka, your idea of a new "social 
contract" between "ecologically conscious better wage earners," 
as the Greens describe them, and the "socially disadvantaged" is 
too short- sighted. This is not a reform coalition. Qualified 
workers, engineers, and self-employed persons belong to it. 
  Fischer: Exactly. And these are the people who 
have to be told the truth. 
  DIE ZEIT: According to the SPD program, the social 
security system and tax system are supposed to be implemented 
together. 
  Scharping: Right. State benefits that serve to 
bridge the social gap must not increase in line with incomes. 
That is why we insist on fixed amounts of money for child 
benefit and housing construction, and the abolition of tax on 
these benefits. This will release many people from the tax 
burden, and render many bureaucratic procedures superfluous. 
  DIE ZEIT: I wonder how long we can continue making 
certain benefits also available to better wage earners. 
  Scharping: That is something which the tax system 
must control, not the social security system. Otherwise there 
will be overview, and no majority support. 
  Fischer: We will see. 
  Scharping: I overlook the fact that some of your 
views are quite unfeasible. Even in environmental policy, you 
are not doing the things you should have and could have done. 
Saarland has gone further than any other land as far as solar 
energy is concerned, Hamburg has achieved the greatest progress 
concerning water conservation. The pollution map shows only two 
rivers marked in dark red -- the Emscher, and the Ried in Hesse. 
I could give more examples. 
  Fischer: Your examples are inaccurate. You omit 
to mention our 105 million mark expenditure on water 
conservation measures, our law on energy conservation, our 
program for improving the safety of chemical installations, and 
a lot of other things. But let us stick to nuclear energy. The 
Greens have resolved -- against my wishes -- that the abandoning 
of nuclear energy within the space of two years is technically 
and legally possible. There is nothing wrong with that. But 
who is to pay for it? 
  Scharping: It would cost 200 billion marks. 
  Fischer: It is possible to reach a consensus 
whereby the abandoning of nuclear energy can only be seriously 
possible when there is a reform coalition. But I do not know 
how long that would last. What I do know is that the oldest 
nuclear plants, such as Biblis A, will be out of service. One 
can immediately say no to the processing of nuclear fuel abroad. 
  Scharping: I agree. 
  Fischer: Wonderful. Therefore the processing 
facility in Sellafeld will also be expendable. All this can be 
achieved. The remaining operating periods for individual 
reactors will be agreed upon, and the disposal of strict limits 
of nuclear waste will have to be arranged. 
  DIE ZEIT: Mr. Scharping, if you become 
chancellor, how long will it be before the last nuclear plant is 
switched off? 
  Scharping: Not very long. Stade can be closed 
down, and Biblis A as well. Closing down the rest depends on an 
energy consensus that must lead to the abandoning of nuclear 
energy. 
  DIE ZEIT: What about the option of reverting to 
nuclear energy if there turns out to be a safe reactor? 
  Scharping: No, there would be no return to 
nuclear energy.

  [Text] Smaller volumes of soil, up to 500 tonnes in 
particular, can be freed of hydrocarbon contamination in a 
tank-type cleansing reactor using a biological process. The 
separate processing of individual soil batches also has the 
advantage that each owner's soil batch remains separate and can 
thus be returned to the original spot. 
  HGN Hydrogeology Norhausen's plant centers on a completely 
covered tank-type cleansing reactor in which the pollutants are 
degraded. The reactor can be transported on a container truck. 
Tank capacity is designed for a maximum of seven cubic meters, 
so the reactor can be loaded onto a truck even when full. 
  Soils contaminated with aliphatic, aromatic, and halogenated 
hydrocarbons in concentrations up to 30,000 mg/kg dry weight can 
be treated. A built-in soil air extractor also makes it 
possible to eliminate volatile aromatic and halogenated 
compounds. 
<H5>  Pollutant Degradation in Just a Few Weeks </H5>
  The microflora native to the polluted area is generally used 
in the reclamation operation. Microorganism activity is 
enhanced and pollutant degradation accelerated by adding a 
nutrient solution and forced air ventilation. Only in special 
cases is it necessary to add purpose-bred organisms. The 
treatment time depends on the degree of contamination: usually 
the pollutants are degraded within a few weeks. 
  Compressed air is forced in to aerate the soil through 
perforated hoses laid longitudinally along the inner wall of the 
reactor. The exhaust air is extracted from the housing, 
filtered through activated carbon or a biofilter, and discharged 
into the atmosphere. Water -- with or without the added nutrient 
solution -- trickles out of an irrigation system installed in 
the hood covering the tank. Once it has seeped through the soil, 
the water is drawn off through the tank's perforated double 
base, after which it is reconditioned in a central water 
purifying plant outside the reactor and recycled into the 
reactor.

  [Text] There are numerous tar dumps in the new federal 
laender, the result of lignite coking residue dumping. A 
two-stage conditioning process developed by Wuppertal-based OeKa 
can be used to obtain a solid fuel from this matter, which is 
rich in phenol and aromatic hydrocarbons. 
  If a lime-based storage mineral (Novomix) in suspension form 
is stirred into the tar, it both reduces the odor given off and 
creates an initial liquid fuel that can easily be piped off. In 
the second stage, Novomix-F is added continuously as a 
compacting agent, within a short time turning the tar into a 
solid substance matching raw lignite in appearance and calorific 
value. This material can consequently be burned along with 
lignite. The storage minerals' basic components bind the acid 
components of the flue gas during combustion. 
  The process has been successfully tested in a pilot project 
supported by the Land of Brandenburg. The storage mineral, 
which OeKa Environmental Engineering developed together with 
various universities, can be used to immobilize pollutants found 
in gases, fluids, and solids.

<F P=106> [Article by Jeanne Rubner: "Research Tanker Steers a New </F>
Course -- Rossendorf Focuses on Materials Science and Reclaiming 
the Uranium Mining Area"] 
  [Text] No, the entrance is by no means imposing. Were it 
not for a rusting sculpture of the Greek letter psi surrounded 
by spheres in elliptic orbits -- symbolizing atomic physics -- 
one could drive straight past the gate of the Rossendorf 
research site near Dresden without even noticing it. 
Nevertheless, with close to 2,000 employees, the former GDR 
[German Democratic Republic] Central Institute of Nuclear 
Research used to be the largest Academy of Sciences facility, 
indeed the largest research institute in the whole of the east. 
  Even today, the site, with its barbed wire fence and drab 
buildings, hardly beckons invitingly to visitors. Perhaps it is 
not meant to, for radioactive waste from the research reactor, 
which has now been shut down, has been dumped in the Rossendorf 
woods. "Things were easier in GDR days," says Gudrun Zwicker, 
formerly a physicist in Rossendorf and now consultant to the 
scientific director, Wolf Haefele. "In those days the waste 
went to Morsleben." This permanent store has now been closed. 
The nuclear laboratory had to be sealed up overnight after 
unification. Many employees with the requisite know-how have 
been dismissed, says Zwicker. 
  A reprocessing company now looks after radioactive waste 
disposal. It was founded in 1992 and employs a staff of 130. 
The waste problem is "highly complex and technically 
difficult," says Haefele, who was previously the director of the 
Juelich Nuclear Research Center. The disposal work will keep 
the company busy for 15 to 20 years, he believes. 
<H5>  Problems Specific to the East </H5>
  The five Rossendorf Research Center institutes that are 
currently operative came into being two years ago, some of them 
growing out of the sectors positively assessed by the Science 
Council. In the same way that the Karlsruhe and Juelich nuclear 
research centers are looking around for new tasks, whether in 
brain or environmental research, a new profile is also being 
sought in Rossendorf. Problems specific to the east compound the 
problems also experienced in the west in such attempts to steer 
a cumbersome "research tanker" onto a new course. Unlike 
Karlsruhe and Juelich, Rossendorf is not a major research 
facility, but what is known as a Blue List institute, which is 
consequently only 50-percent -- and not 90-percent -- financed 
by the Federal Government. The Land of Saxony foots the other 
half of the bill. Apart from the new institute directors, some 
of whom come from the west, almost all the 450 permanent 
employees were inherited from GDR days. Their average age is 
very high, and as a result many of them are finding it difficult 
to adjust to the changeover. To add to the problems, there is 
considerable feeling of insecurity among the researchers. 
  Indeed, it is not yet known whether all the institutes can 
actually carry on in their current form. For example, the 
Institute of Nuclear and Hadron Physics is the only one of its 
kind left in eastern Europe. However, competition in this field 
of research, which is nevertheless slowly becoming extinct, is 
considerable in the West. So is the institute still needed? It 
also has the problem that its director designate has backed out. 
There is thus also some doubt as to whether the planned 
electron accelerator will be built. 
  If it is not, it is unlikely that there will be a major 
facility in Rossendorf in the foreseeable future, as the 
research reactor, a neutron source previously used for materials 
research and for the production of isotopes for medical 
applications, has been shut down, contrary to the Science 
Council's recommendations. The federal research minister in 
office at the time was unwilling to spend the 60 million German 
marks that it would have cost to bring the reactor, which had 
been renovated immediately prior to the German unification, up 
to "western standards." 
<H5>  Anxieties About the Future </H5>
  The Institute of Safety Research, too, has grounds for 
anxiety as to its future. It has to date been working on 
Soviet-type reactors, but since the Greifswald pile was shut 
down, there have been none left in the Federal Republic. The 
Science Council met last week to discuss the future of 
Rossendorf and will pronounce judgment in mid- May. 
  The prospects look better for the Institute of Ion Beam 
Physics and Materials Research, where the focus is on 
electrically charged atom beam applications in surface treatment 
and materials research, things it was doing, at least in part, 
before the unification. "At that time, our scientists were 
competitive," says director Wolfhard Moeller, "although much of 
the apparatus was hopelessly obsolete." This situation has 
changed since then, the laboratories now boasting several 
ultramodern ion accelerators and the institute being the biggest 
of its kind in Europe. 
The researchers there use a method, developed back in GDR days, 
of extraordinary interest to art historians, as they use proton 
beams to study works of art. The charged nuclear components 
penetrate the layers close to the surface, and the radiation 
emitted (X-ray waves, or protons themselves) makes it possible 
to identify the chemical elements contained in the colors used 
in a painting, for instance. The applications for this 
noninvasive test procedure are self-evident: If the yellow, for 
example, is not a lead and tin mixture but a chrome mix not 
available in the middle ages, whereas the painting is attributed 
to that period, it could be a fake. 
  The institute is also engaged in work on miniature sensors. 
Sophisticated instruments have usually been needed to date to 
detect certain pollutants in the environment, especially when 
they occur in minute quantities. The intention is therefore to 
build sensitive sensors that can be produced cheaply and on an 
industrial scale for deployment on numerous sites. The 
individual components required are already available: special 
semiconductor devices known as ion- sensitive field-effect 
transistors measure concentrations of substances in, for 
instance, a water sample. Liquids are fed through by micropumps 
and valves. 
<H5>  Measuring Ion Levels in the Blood </H5>
  The time has now come to combine these components on a small 
silicon wafer, thus creating a complete, autonomous measuring 
system capable of handling small samples. A system of this type 
could also be of interest to the medical profession, for 
measuring ion levels in the blood, for instance. The Rossendorf 
researchers have now succeeded in building a pump that is 
incorporated into the silicon wafer. It measures one centimeter 
square and can flush one microliter of liquid per hour through a 
fine pore. The scientists hope to present a complete measuring 
system within the next few months. 
  Another institute in Rossendorf, the Radiation Chemistry 
Institute, is endeavoring to assist Wismut GmbH with reclamation 
work on the former uranium mine. "About 250,000 tonnes of 
uranium ore have been mined in Saxony and Thuringia since 1945. 
The earth was completely raped by pumping acids in," says Heino 
Nitsche, director of the institute. Gigantic contaminated 
areas, shafts, and slagheaps are the result. 
<H5>  Controversy as To Correct Reclamation Method </H5>
  The experts are still arguing over the best way to clean the 
area up. In any case, however, the salvage work will cost a 
great deal of money. "So it is worthwhile getting the basic 
principles straight to start with," says Nitsche. In other 
words, how does radioactivity spread in the air and soil, how do 
the rock and water strata interact with one another, and what 
by-products are formed when uranium decomposes? "There are 
already models that describe the spread of radioactive 
substances, for example," says Nitsche. All they need to obtain 
accurate forecasts is precise input data, and this is where the 
scientist comes in.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 25, BNS -- Estonian Environment 
Minister Andres Tarand and Lauri Vaarja, the general director of 
the Fishing Department, returned today from Sweden where they 
attended a fishing conference of the Baltic coast nations. On 
the agenda of the conference were the situation with the stocks 
of fish, fishing statistics and exchange of information. 
  The meeting discussed the decline in the stocks of cod in 
the 
Baltic and the need to improve statistics on cod fishing, as 
well as diseases of Baltic salmon and the possibility of joint 
reasearch into their reasons. 
  Vaarja reported to the meeting on Estonian statistics 
concerning stocks of fish, noting that collecting complete 
overall statistics is difficult, since the task of amassing data 
has been laid on local governments. 
  The participants decided that, in order to improve catch 
statistics, the Baltic Sea states should exchange information 
about all fishing vessels that put in at their ports and prevent 
illicit port visits. 
  Tarand said in an interview with BNS that coordinating 
cooperation between Baltic coast nations on the level of prime 
ministers is one of the opportunities to improve information 
exchange. 
  The meeting in Sweden also touched upon the stock of seals 
in 
the Baltic. Although seals pose a threat to fish, they are in 
jeopardy themselves due to environmental pollution. 
  The next fishing conference was set for the beginning of 
1995.

<F P=106> [Michael Bond article; "Poisonous Trail of the Toxic </F>
Cowboys"] 
  [Text] One day at the end of last summer a small container 
ship edged quietly out of Tilbury docks in Britain and headed 
across the Atlantic for South America. Its decks were laden 
with dozens of metal barrels filled with 300 tonnes of what the 
labels innocently referred to as agricultural nutrients for soil 
treatment. 
  But when Customs officers inspected the ship as it docked in 
Brazil they discovered that the barrels were packed full, not of 
harmless fertilisers but of highly toxic chemicals such as lead, 
mercury, cadmium and arsenic. 
  Fearing that this cargo with its cancer-causing ingredients 
would end up, like dozens before it, dumped in a secluded spot 
in the Brazilian countryside, the officers refused to allow it 
ashore. The freighter, its cover blown, was forced to chug back 
to Britain fully laden. 
  Such shipments have always been unwelcome, and often 
clandestine, but no one knew for certain that they were illegal. 
Companies could export toxic waste for "recycling", but there 
was no effective check on whether the destination countries had 
necessary facilities. 
  But in March this year an attempt was made to close the 
loophole. The 127 signatories to the 1989 Basel Convention 
outlawed the dumping of any toxic waste by the industrialised 
nations on their most regular victims -- non-members of the 
Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 
the developing world like Brazil and Indonesia. But in view of 
the time it takes to build waste-disposal plants, the new rules 
do not take effect until 1997. 
  Police are now concerned that the threat of tighter 
regulations will tempt companies to find cheaper, illegal ways 
of disposing of their waste. Indeed, the loudest applause for 
the new ruling will have come from organised criminal groups, 
some of which are already being paid vast sums of money by 
European and U.S. companies to dispose of their waste overseas. 
The ban opens up whole new areas of profitable operations for 
the smugglers of poison. 
  The accepted safe methods of disposal -- incineration or 
burying in specially sealed containers -- are complex and, at 
$400 a tonne, expensive. Denied the opportunity to dispose 
legally and easily of their material, companies will be more 
prone to enlist the aid of gangs to do the job. 
  Jim Puckett' of Greenpeace in Amsterdam, said: "The ban will 
succeed in closing most of the legal loopholes, but the illegal 
waste trade will become immensely profitable. The cost of 
disposing of waste in Europe by legal methods has sky-rocketed, 
and it will be easy for a firm to pay criminals a few dollars a 
barrel to get around it." 
  It is already profitable enough for organisations like the 
Mafia to have moved in. A company based in northern Italy, with 
confirmed Mafia connections, was paid by several Italian firms 
to get rid of huge quantities of toxic waste. A large part of it 
was dumped in Somalia, the rest in Vietnam and Cambodia. 
According to one investigator on the case: "The company signed 
contracts with waste producers to get rid of the stuff. When it 
was prevented from dumping all of it in Somalia, it had to find 
other places. But international contacts are no problem for 
these people." The firm's boss has since fled abroad. 
  The German Federal Criminal Bureau (BEA) is looking into 
dozens of cases in which criminal gangs are suspected of taking 
waste from industrial firms and dumping it in lakes and quarries 
in eastern Europe, which will be paying the price for decades to 
come. Children searching smouldering dumps for anything they can 
sell -- a common sight from Romania to the Philippines -- have 
no way of knowing that their health is being destroyed by the 
detritus of an Essen factory. 
  Every year thousands of tonnes of waste containing 
incinerator ash, old car batteries, tyres, solvents, paints, 
out-of-date pesticides and toxic heavy metals are dumped in such 
countries. 
  Germany, the world's largest exporter of toxic waste, sent 
1,370,892 tonnes of toxic waste and other hazardous rubbish to 
non- OECD countries between 1989 and 1993. Some of this was 
legally exported, under the old rules, for "recycling" to 
Indonesia and eastern Europe, but much was shipped in under 
false labels or simply dumped by unscrupulous German waste 
operators. 
  Romania, Albania, Poland and the former Soviet Union are the 
most popular dumping grounds. In 1992, 500 tonnes of 
out-of-date pesticides from east Germany were discovered near 
the town of Sibiu in Romania. 
  They had been tipped there illegally over a period of two 
years after being carried across the border labelled as 
"humanitarian aid -- for use in agriculture". 
  In March this year the German government agreed to pay for 
the removal of 400 tonnes of old pesticides which had been sent 
to Albania by a German company in March 1992 labelled as 
"humanitarian aid". Two years after it had arrived the 
consignment was still sitting on the train in which it had 
arrived -- dubbed the "death train" by Albanian newspapers -- at 
Bajze near the border with Montenegro, and much of it was 
leaking. 
  According to John Arans, a Greenpeace investigator who 
worked 
as a detective in the Netherlands for 22 years, criminal 
networks stretching from Italy to Russia are secretly funding 
illegal waste companies in Europe. "The export of illegal waste 
is related to the drugs and arms trades" he said. "The same 
names keep coming up again and again during investigations into 
these activities." 
  Italian police also claim that the Mafia has infiltrated the 
waste industry, charging companies for taking toxic waste off 
their hands and disposing of it in quarries or even on 
roadsides. Italy produces 15 million tonnes of toxic waste each 
year but has the capacity to treat just 1.5 million tonnes 
safely. 
Europe's waste disposal industry this week joined 
environmentalists in calling for tighter controls on movements 
of toxic waste. Dieter Vogt, of the European Association of 
Waste Disposers, said: "We have more than enough regulations on 
toxic waste, but not enough is being done to implement them. It 
is up to governments to make them stick." 
  The police are not prepared to wait. Teams of detectives are 
already being assembled to track and stop the smugglers. 
Whether they can stem the toxic tide remains to be seen.

  [Text] Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, May 24 KYODO -- Four 
nations advanced an alternative proposal Tuesday [24 May] to a 
plan for imposing a whale sanctuary in the Antarctic that would 
virtually bar Japan and other whaling nations from resuming 
commercial whaling. 
  Chile, Argentina, Sweden and Switzerland jointly put the new 
proposal forward at a session of the International Whaling 
Commission (IWC) here, conference sources said. 
  The compromise plan appeared to stand a better chance of 
being approved than the original French-led proposal, the 
sources said. Of its joint sponsors, Chile voted against and 
Mexico for a similar sanctuary plan at last year's meeting while 
the remaining two abstained. 
  The revised plan is a scaled-back version of the drastic 
French proposal which would ban whaling in a vast area of the 
Southern Hemisphere that stretches from latitude 40 degrees 
south to the shores of the Antarctica, they said. 
  The fresh proposal, however, if adopted, would mandate a ban 
on any hauls of minke whales -- the last large whales to have 
survived the modern whaling era -- whose numbers are estimated 
by the IWC at 760,000. 
  Japan, where whale meat consumption is considered customary, 
has been calling for exclusion of minke whales from protection 
under the sanctuary formula. 
  The proposal, however, corresponds with the Japanese 
proposal 
in that it would pare down the scope of the French-proposed 
sanctuary to a narrower area that stretches from latitude 55 to 
60 degrees south to the Antarctic shores. 
  It would authorize hunting of sei whales, which make an 
annual migratory tour throughout a vast aquatic range stretching 
to the equator. Sei whales are reportedly endangered. 
  It would also allow whaling in the 200-nautical-mile zone 
off 
the shores of Chile, one of the four proponents of the proposal.

  [Text] The whale sanctuary in the Antarctic has been 
approved. Most of the countries participating in the 46th annual 
meeting of the International Whaling Commission [IWC] said yes 
to the proposal to establish an area of protection against 
commercial whaling. Thirty countries participated in the final 
vote. Of these, 23 countries, including Mexico, were in favor. 
One country, Japan, voted against the proposal. There were six 
abstentions. Norway decided not to participate in the vote. 
  The sanctuary that was accepted corresponds to the proposal 
presented on Thursday morning by Mexico, France, and Chile and 
was supported by the rest of the nations. It will be located at 
latitude 40 degrees south, but the 200 nautical miles of Chile 
and Argentina will be respected.

<F P=106> [Report by Yan Berling in Severomorsk; from the "Novosti" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The first trainload of the nuclear fuel waste has 
left the Sogagorka railway junction in Arkhangelsk at 0200 
today. For almost three years now the nuclear reactor rods have 
been deposited at the SevMash [Severodvinsk Machine-building] 
enterprise in Severodvinsk at which redundant nuclear submarines 
are being dismantled. Nearly 40 submarines are waiting today 
for their nuclear fuel waste to be disposed. 
  For the past three years Severodvinsk has been under a 
threat 
of ecological catastrophe. A slightest error in handling 
nuclear fuel could lead to irreversible consequences. The 
volume of radioactive waste exceeded all accepted norms. 
  The reasons for this pileup was the fact that previously 
nuclear waste was shipped by sea to a place near Murmansk where 
it was loaded onto railway cars and transported to 
Chelyabinsk-65 for disposal. This was too expensive and the 
North Fleet command suggested the waste should be transported 
directly from Severodvinsk and Archangelsk. The State 
ecological expert commission was examining this proposal for 
several years, which resulted in a pileup of nuclear waste 
waiting to be transported. 
  Nevertheless, the first trainload has now been dispatched. 
The railway lines had to be repaired urgently for this 
occasion. The safety of the load was ensured by introduction of 
new specially designed containers. [Video shows train with

  [Text] On 18 April, the Environment Agency's "Study Panel 
on the Promotion of Low-Pollution Vehicles and Their Widespread 
Use in Local Districts" (with Waseda University Professor 
Yasuhiro Daisei as its chairman) compiled its final report in 
which it recommended that "to promote the widespread use of 
low-pollution vehicles, public agencies such as the national and 
local governments should set specific targets and try to 
actively promote the introduction of such vehicles." For the 
first time, the report shows in concrete figures that, in 
reality, there have only been a few cases in which these 
environmentally clean vehicles have been introduced even in 
cases where the opportunities were very good. On the basis of 
the report, the Environment Agency plans to consult with the 
relevant government ministries and agencies and then include in 
the basic environment program on which it is currently working 
the specific number of low-pollution vehicles it hopes to 
introduce within a certain period. 
  Currently, there is not enough demand to warrant 
manufacturers' mass production of low-pollution vehicles. This 
is reflected in the high prices of such vehicles, and this in 
turn impedes their widespread use. Thus, as a last resort to 
improve the ever-worsening air pollution in metropolitan 
districts in Tokyo and six prefectures, the government has 
spelled out a plan to introduce 300,000 environmentally clean 
vehicles by 2000. These are vehicles which produce no or very 
little exhaust emissions, such as electric cars, those powered 
by methanol or natural gas, and hybrid cars combining a 
conventional engine with electric power. It is feared, however, 
that the government's plan may not be carried out successfully. 
  Late last year, the Environment Agency's study panel 
surveyed 
government ministries and agencies, and prefectures, as well as 
cities with at least 500,000 inhabitants, and questioned 
officials at such public agencies as to what extent they could 
introduce low-pollution vehicles. The panel subsequently 
analyzed the results of the survey which showed that although, 
with proper management, approximately half of the 68,000 
vehicles officially used by such organizations could be replaced 
with low-pollution vehicles, only 268 such vehicles are 
currently in use. 
  In particular, although approximately 4,000 electric cars 
could definitely be used by central government ministries and 
agencies, only two, as a matter of fact, are being used as 
official vehicles for senior officials at the Environment Agency 
and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Survey 
results also showed that although hybrid vehicles could replace 
all 40 trucks and buses currently being used, not even one has 
been replaced. 
  The report compiled by the Environment Agency's study panel 
also touches on the issue of how government ministries and 
agencies and local governments ought to use official vehicles 
for transporting senior officials. In its report, the panel 
urges public agencies to further strive actively toward 
promoting the widespread use of low-pollution vehicles. For 
example, it suggests employing a combination of railway systems 
using electric railcars.

  [Text] Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] is now 
communicating and exchanging information with Green Peace, the 
international environment protection organization known for its 
anti-nuclear and anti-whaling campaigns. Greenpeace is the 
organization which has by actions shown its dislike for the 
Japanese Government over issues of plutonium shipment and 
whaling. MOFA in the past has even avoided coming into contact 
with the organization. But having been beaten completely by 
Greenpeace in the collection of information on Russia's dumping 
of radioactive wastes into the sea, MOFA, while admitting its 
exchanges with the group will have limitations, wants to hold 
active exchanges with it as a source of information on such 
matters as Russia's disposal of nuclear wastes. 
  Russia dumped nuclear wastes into the Sea of Japan last 
October. The first report of this shocking news came from 
Greenpeace, and pictures of Greenpeace's ship pursuing waste 
dumping ships came on television screens across Japan. For the 
MOFA which had had no information on the dumping at all, it was 
a loss of face and a chance to be reminded of the group's 
"capabilities." 
  Yoshitaka Kawamura, counselor (in charge of arms control and 
science) of the MOFA Foreign Policy Bureau, and Naoki Ohara, 
chief secretary of Greenpeace Japan, came to know each other in 
an international conference on marine pollution prevention in 
November. Ohara phoned the former in February. Counselor 
Kawamura recalled, "I was not quite happy because of the 
experiences of the past, but I thought we had the common purpose 
of wanting to prevent the dumping." Thus the two came to 
exchange views on the validity of information in reports that 
"dumping would be resumed." Since then, MOFA and Greenpeace 
have continued to exchange information, MOFA asking for 
information that Greenpeace alone possessed and Greenpeace 
asking for information MOFA possessed on Russia. 
  Shocked by the experience in October, the MOFA has increased 
the number of officials handling the nuclear waste dumping issue 
from two to four. The officials have made many trips to Moscow 
and Vladivostok, thus expanding connections with the officials 
of the central government as well as officials concerned in the 
Far East area. The MOFA late last year established a consulate 
general in Vladivostok, and has put in efforts on information 
collection. A ministry official was full of confidence saying, 
"Now, European countries and the United States come to us to ask 
about the situation in the Russian Far East." 
  Yoshiji Nogami, a councilor of MOFA's Foreign Policy Bureau, 
insisted, "It is not a bad idea to actively exchange views and 
information with organizations which hold views different from 
us." Greenpeace Japan's Chief Secretary Ohara on his part said 
about the information of exchange, "We will cooperate as long as 
it helps environmental protection." 
  Within MOFA, however, the Economic Affairs Bureau, which is 
in charge of the whaling issue, is of a different mind. The 
bureau continues to confront the group squarely from front.

  [Text] Prague April 18 (CTK) -- In his talks with his 
Austrian counterpart, Thomas Klestil, last Friday [15 April], 
Czech President Vaclav Havel interpreted the Czech Government's 
stance towards the nuclear power plant now under construction in 
Temelin, South Bohemia, a spokesman of the Czech Industry and 
Trade Ministry told CTK today. 
  The two presidents met at the two-day Central European 
summit 
in Litomysl, East Bohemia. 
  In Litomysl, Havel told Klestil that according to all 
analyses, the Temelin project was the only chance for the Czech 
energy industry, and its level would be equal to that of Western 
facilities of its kind. Havel said he was sure that it was 
necessary to complete the power plant so that brown coal mining 
and burning could be cut down. Havel also promised Klestil 
Prague would provide Vienna with every necessary information on 
possible emergencies. 
  The Austrian Press Agency APA has reported that Havel said 
that no more nuclear power plants would be built in the Czech 
Republic after the completion of Temelin. APA quoted Klestil as 
saying that Havel thought the Czech Republic would shift to 
other forms of energy production within 10-15 years. 
  Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy estimates 
the minimum operation-life of the Temelin power plant at 25-30 
years, his spokesman told CTK.

  [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- The export of 
non-renewable resources and products which have not been very 
highly processed made up 32 percent of overall Czech exports, a 
fact which Environmental Minister Frantisek Benda considers 
alarming, he said at a press conference of the Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS) today. 
  Benda commented that practically no government policy for 
raw 
materials was in existence. 
  Concerning the Temelin nuclear power plant, the minister 
said 
he thought it essential that an atomic code be created which 
would include the atomic law as well as other laws concerning 
nuclear power. The code would primarily concern legal 
regulations for the storage of nuclear waste or the 
establishment of a fund for the disposal of nuclear equipment. 
  The ministry has completed a document entitled "Government 
Environmental Policy" which the government received last 
December as an outline proposal for the activities of the 
Environment Ministry. After being discussed by 
inter-governmental agencies, the document will be presented to 
the government. The ministry included in its outline an 
environmental action program which includes short term programs 
of about three years in duration.

  [Text] Most, North Bohemia, May 14 (CTK) -- The account of 
the small privatisation has enough means for allocating 6 
billion crowns (200 million USD) for environmental purposes, 
chairman of the National Property Fund (FNM) and chairman of the 
parliamentary budget committee Tomas Jezek told journalists 
today. 
  The proposed programme of air purification should receive 
enough money for its completion, he added. The sum which is 
necessary for implementation of gas heating and elimination of 
small and medium-sized sources of pollution was calculated by 
the Environment Ministry, Jezek reported. 
  Jezek said he was surprised at the governmental position 
which wanted to lower the sum to three billion crowns (100 
million USD). "The parliamentary draft law is still in force, 
while the government presents its position. However, the 
parliament decides," Jezek said. 
  On May 11 the government approved the allocation of three 
billion crowns, obtained from the proceeds of the small 
privatisation, to the State Environment Fund. 
  Afterwards Premier Vaclav Klaus said that the deputies "by 
error" had proposed to transfer 6.1 billion crowns for the 
purpose. He explained that the maximum amount was 5 billion 
crowns (160 million USD) because from the 30 billion (1 billion 
USD) proceeds from the small privatisation some 20 billion had 
been designated for privatisation of the health sector and 5 
billion to settle the restitution claims.

  [Text] Vienna/Prague, May 15 (CTK) -- Czech Trade and 
Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy told the Austrian news agency 
APA today he welcomed the statement by Austrian Vice-Chancellor 
Erhard Busek that the Austrian Government considered the issue 
of completion of the Temelin power plant "closed." 
  Austrian (and Czech) environmentalists, supported by 
political parties, have been strongly protesting against 
Temelin's completion. The Soviet-type plant, to be equipped with 
Westinghouse safety technology, is located about 100km from the 
Austrian border. 
  "I have known this position of Busek for several weeks. It 
was reiterated during our working breakfast on Friday morning 
[13 May]," Dlouhy said. 
  Busek, who has attended the Prague international conference 
Europe and Us, told the APA after the talks with Premier Vaclav 
Klaus that he understood that the energy situation of the Czech 
Republic did not give the country any option but to complete the 
Temelin plant. 
  Dlouhy said that the Czech Republic was refusing the 
Austrian 
proposals to convert the Temelin plant to the use of gas "simply 
because it would be too expensive." He pointed to the fact that 
Austria, too, had refused on economic grounds to rebuild the 
finished Zwentendorf nuclear plant to gas fuel. 
  He expressed the doubts that the "atomic" law, which was 
being prepared, could delay the Temelin completion. 
  "Quite the reverse. The government bill makes it possible to 
continue in the construction works, planned in Temelin for 1994- 
1995," Dlouhy said. The government is trying to finish the law 
before the Temelin plan is commissioned. The parliament could 
approve the "atomic law" during 1995, he added.

  [Text] Prague, May 17 (CTK) -- The absence of mining and 
energy laws in the Czech Republic is proof that democracy is 
sadly lacking in this country, Jarmila Valcikova writes in the 
right- leaning daily CESKY DENIK today. 
  It follows that the state cannot effectively control its 
natural and mineral resources. Strong lobbies after a quick 
buck see this country as their promised land, the paper writes. 
  According to press reports, raw materials, building 
materials 
-- including sandstone and gravel sand -- and fuels accounted 
for over 53 percent of Czech exports in the first nine months of 
last year. 
  These figures provoke anxiety, the paper writes, asking 
whether in the future the Czech Republic will have enough 
resources to afford to buy such materials on the world market. 
  There is no pro-export policy to stimulate small businesses 
with their potential for clever ideas and so the unscrupulous 
pillaging of the land has been going on unchecked. 
  What is more, there are no legislative guidelines to provide 
that the present conditions of early capitalism in the sector 
become more like those of developed societies who protect their 
natural wealth. 
  Compared to 1989, stone exports have gone up 90 times. The 
Vrsetin hill in the Ceske stredohori mountain range has been all 
but flattened. The paper asks whether the whole of Ceske 
stredohori is to disappear for some people's profit and if so, 
who is going to be responsible. 
  Ceske stredohori is state property and should not be owned 
by 
companies. Incidentally, stone is marketed, among others, by 
the former agent Pavel Minarik, the paper says, quoting from 
Minarik's interview with LIDOVE NOVINY. 
  Minarik has recently lodged an appeal against a four year 
jail sentence handed down last September for his part in 
plotting to put Radio Free Europe in Munich out of action in the 
1970s. 
  The project of cement works at Tman, central Bohemia, 
endangers a nature preserve of Cesky kras, an area of 
underground sandstone caves unique throughout the world. 
Already intensive work is going on at railway reloading points 
in Vimperk, Volary and Prachatice, all South Bohemia, through 
which sandstone passes on its way abroad. This year's cement 
export quota amounts to almost two million tonnes. It is not 
known how much earth needs to be dug to yield that amount, the 
paper says. 
  Germany prohibits the use of digging mechanisms harmful to 
the environment, which is why profit-hungry German businessmen 
ship them to this country where their use is unrestricted. 
Commenting on Tman, Czech Minister of Trade and Industry 
Vladimir Dlouhy has allegedly said that he "never spoke in favor 
of the cement works." The hopes these words might incite are 
dashed in the light of the recently destroyed village Libkovice, 
North Bohemia -- a place, the paper says, that he surrendered to 
the coal lobby. 
  But rather than Germans, district officials at Beroun, 
Central Bohemia, administering Tman, employees of the State 
Hygiene Authority and local officials at Tman are to blame. 
  American Indians are said to have once sold land for a few 
bottles of whisky, the paper says, adding that delegating too 
much authority to towns and villages is courting disaster for 
society and nature. 
  The construction of waterways is yet another example of 
profiteering. It may be gravel sand lodged in the river beds 
and not actual river transport that companies such as Ecotrans 
Moravia and its sister companies are interested in, the paper 
speculates. The profitability of river transport is questionable 
and the value of property affected by waterway projects is 
plummeting. Once they have been completed, the surrounding 
environment is eventually reduced to steppes. 
  However, the law banning projects harmful to the 
environment, 
pushed through by the Ministry for the Environment, is there for 
people to lean on if they want, as they should, to defend their 
beautiful country and pass it on to their children, Valcikova 
says in CESKY DENIK.

  [Text] Prague June 2 (CTK) -- The Czech Environment 
Ministry today decided to prevent the import of dangerous waste 
coming mainly from Germany and described as material destined 
for further processing. 
  A newly issued regulation binds the Czech buyers of such 
shipments to take them over still on foreign countries' 
territory, Marie Seborova told journalists today. 
  Seborova, director of the Czech Environment Inspection 
Office, said that the measure would prevent situations similar 
to that occurring at the railway station in Decin, North 
Bohemia, a few days ago. Twenty-two railway carriages loaded 
with dangerous waste were detained and side-tracked there in 
May. The trouble culminated when German customs officers 
refused to take the carriages back, citing administrative 
reasons. 
  Metallic scrap is allowed to contain a maximum of two 
percent 
of non-metallic waste. Both experts from the firm buying the 
scrap and laymen can distinguish whether or not the limit was 
surpassed, Seborova said. 
  Eleven carriages to be returned to Germany are still waiting 
in Decin. Environment inspectors fear the exporter may attempt 
to transfer the returned waste on another border crossing back 
to the Czech Republic, Seborova said.

  [Text] Karvina, North Moravia, May 27 (CTK) -- The 
government will financially support only "non-standard" 
environmental protection projects, Premier Vaclav Klaus told 
journalists after visiting the most devastated localities of the 
Karvina black coal mining area today. 
  Klaus said that towns and villages would have to implement 
by 
themselves standard projects aimed at restoring the environment 
spoilt by mining. He described as useful the current efforts by 
the management of the Ostravsko-Karvinske Doly mining company 
and representatives of the town of Karvina at establishing a 
proper co-existence which in practice would mean the abolition 
of the long-lasting "dictate" from the miners. 
  In connection with the planned sale of some 20,000 
apartments 
in Karvina Klaus said that in his view the general intention to 
sell apartments to their owners is "an idea erroneous from the 
very beginning which will get us nowhere and will only cause 
endless problems. I have never advised anyone to sell 
individual apartments, I have always recommended that owners be 
found for whole buildings within which flats would continue to 
be rented," Klaus said. He added that the sale of individual 
apartments would lead to the appearance of new, just as 
inflexible housing management firms. 
  During his visit to Karvina Klaus delivered a lecture at the 
Commercial and Business faculty of the Silesian University. He 
said that the development of the Czech economy thus far showed 
that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) could grow this year by 
two to three per cent with the unemployment rate not exceeding 
four per cent at the end of the year. 
  At the evening Klaus met Karvina inhabitants at a public 
rally.

  [Text] Budapest, 24 May (MTI) -- A sophisticated 
environment-protection programme for the Danube region has been 
initiated recently by the Hungarian Ministry of Environment and 
Regional Policy. Hungary also claims that an international 
project should be approved in order to provide for all drainage 
areas of the river. Hungary is the only European country 
threatened by critial conditions in water supply around the year 
2000. 
  The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
(FAO) registers Hungary among the first 30 (mainly desert) 
states whose drinking water supply is not secured for the 
future. Ninety-five percent of the surface waterways of the 
country originate abroad, which causes purity and quantity 
problems. In 1992 Hungary initiated an environment-protection 
programme for the Danube Basin. In order to solve present 
problems, which foreshadow further ones in the future, water 
management should be regulated under an agreement, with strong 
commitment by all concerned to carry through their respective 
obligations, Hungarian authorities say. Hungarian specialists 
say that although the country's water reserves are expected to 
decline in the following years, they will probably still meet 
all demand after the turn of the century. 
  Waiting to see the issue of surface waterways settled, 
Hungary is striving to preserve its underground water reserves. 
There is no agreement with Ukraine, Romania, or Slovakia that 
would oblige these countries to inform Hungary on water 
pollution occurring in their own territories. Slovakia, for 
example, takes out such a large amount of water from the river 
Sajo each summer that the Sajo enters Hungary no longer as a 
river but rather as a small stream. Besides, Slovakia operates 
two barrage irrigation systems on the river Ipoly. Another major 
problem is the decline in water reserves near the Gabcikovo 
barrage system. 
  Water filtered through gravel beds is excellent for 
consumption. Wells operating on this principle supply the 
population of the Danube Bend and Budapest through a pipe water 
system and might serve as the drinking water source of around 4 
million people in the future. (The population of Hungary is 10.3 
million.) Nitrate pollutants have to be filtered in these wells 
too, although 15 years ago this was not necessary. (Most of the 
pollution is due to the lack of sewage networks in nearby 
settlements.) The river Tisza in the eastern part of Hungary, 
which springs from Ukraine and has been known for its clean 
water over the past 25 years, has recently become polluted at 
places. The river Koros, originating in Romania, has also 
declined in quality. 
  "Karst" and artesian waters are the real preserves of 
Hungary. According to recent figures, their quantity exceeds the 
consumption of the public, industry, and agriculture. Though 
mining has caused long-lasting and difficult-to-remedy changes, 
experts expect earlier, better conditions to return within a 
decade's time. 
  The Danube-Tisza region in eastern Hungary has been 
seriously 
endangered by the lack of irrigation water. In the past 15-20 
years, successive droughts have reduced the ground water 
surface. Traditional plants being unable to absorb water from 
3-6 metres down, new species had to be introduced. However, 
declines in the region's agricultural production have been 
considerable. 
  Ninety-eight per cent of Hungary's population drinks piped 
water. Per capita water consumption has fallen to 150 litres per 
day from 250 litres in earlier years. Experts say that drinking 
water should be separated from water used for other purposes 
(washing, watering, etc.) with an extra pipe system added, as it 
has been already in some western European countries.

  [Text] Moscow, May 24 (MTI) -- The protocol on returning 
to, and storing in, Russia the used fuel cartridges of the Paks 
nuclear power plant violates a Russian law on environmental 
protection, President Boris Yeltsin's adviser on environmental 
affairs said. 
  The protocol was signed during Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's visit to Budapest early April. 
  The adviser, Aleksei Yablokov, chairman of the environmental 
interdepartmental committee of the Russian National Security 
Council, pressed for immediate talks with Hungary on the matter. 
  Meeting Hungarian journalists, Yablokov said that Clause 34 
in Paragraph 50 of Russia's law on environmental protection, 
approved two years ago, bars the delivery of any radioactive 
waste to Russia for the purpose of storage or recycling. 
  The law applies to Hungary but does not affect some other 
countries, for instance Finland or Bulgaria, which built 
Soviet-type nuclear power plants and agreed on returning the 
radioactive waste before the Russian law took effect. 
  "This is a rather complex problem. Radioactive pollution 
poses a particularly grave challenge in Russia. It became clear 
after decades of secrecy how polluted our country is. Unlawful 
importation of radiocative waste is a headache," Yablokov said. 
  On the protocol, the adviser saw two options. The related 
clause of the law could be amended -- a possible but lengthy 
procedure. Or Russia would accept the recycled waste, sealed in 
glass, being returned to Hungary. If Hungary were prepared to 
take the waste back this way, the protocol could be amended 
accordingly, he said. 
  Commenting on Chernomyrdin's latest remark that the protocol 
is not subject to approval by the Duma, Yablokov said the prime 
minsiter can ignore the Duma but it remains to be seen how long 
he can do so. "The prime minister will hardly openly confront 
the Duma because of nuclear waste," he said.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 22/4/1994 -- The Black Sea's 
fish potential had more than halved in the last 30 years because 
of pollution, more than 40 fish species were destroyed in this 
sea, said Louis Rey, member of the Crans Montana Forum 
Foundation's Council. 
  The session on "Mediterranean and Black Sea International 
Network for Clean Technology Transfer" sounded the alarm as 
regarded the ecological situation, warning on the necessity that 
urgent steps be taken in order to mend the situation. "The 
Black Sea pollution is a very urgent and very important issue 
for the international community," said in turn Jean Paul 
Carteron, president of the Forum Foundation. The Black Sea, he 
said, is an ecological bomb, as tremendous amounts of wastes 
were disposed of in it. The speakers highlighted the necessity 
of a more intense cooperation among the riperian countries in 
view of curbing this real scourge and sustained the idea of 
developing and transferring clean technologies allowing both for 
industrial development and the preservation of an unpolluted 
environment. Aurel Constantin Ilie, minister of environment of 
Romania, stressed his country's interest and involvement in the 
transfer of technology both as regarded the Black Sea protection 
but also the protection of the Danube and its delta for which 
there was even an international project. He showed there are 14 
zones in Romania where the environment is systematically damaged 
by polluting technologies. Romania does have solutions for 
these zones but no funds to apply them, he added.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 23 (CTK) -- Equipment for 
monitoring and exchange of data on radiation between Slovakia 
and Austria will start operating in September, according to an 
agreement signed today. 
  The signatories were Slovak Environment Minister Juraj 
Hrasko 
and Austrian Health Minister Christa Krammer. 
  "Slovakia is the first country with which we will connect 
systems warning against radiation," Krammer said at a press 
conference today. 
  She added that talks are under way also with the Czech 
Republic and Slovenia, and Hungary and Germany are also under 
consideration. The Austrian Government paid 3.5 million 
schillings for the system. 
  The move is an important step on Slovakia's path towards 
joining international cooperation in the area. The Austrian 
monitoring system is composed of 336 automated measuring 
stations, while Slovakia has only 26. 
  The need to connect both systems resulted from a visit of a 
Slovak Government delegation to Austria in May last year.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on environmental issues monitored through 24 May. 
<H5>  Brazil </H5>
  Philip Fearnside, scientist for the National Institute for 
Amazon Region Research in Manaus, on 5 May criticized a bill 
that authorizes fiscal incentives for the installation, 
modernization, and development of industrial and agricultural 
jobs through 31 December 2000 in areas under the jurisdiction of 
the Amazon Regional Development Superintendency and the 
Northeast Development Superintendency. The bill was submitted by 
Senator Marco Maciel, and already has been passed by the Senate 
and the Chamber of Deputies. He said the fiscal incentive policy 
for the Amazon promoted by the military government greatly 
contributed to the huge deforestation of the Amazon with the 
implementation of agricultural and livestock projects in humid 
tropical forests. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 
6 May 94 p 9) 
  President Itamar Franco has ordered the release of 1.8 
billion cruzeiros to continue the demarcation of the Quilombo do 
Flexal reserve in Maranhao. Federal Deputy Haroldo Saboya said 
the government guaranteed the Quilombo do Flexal reserve but 
failed to renew the reserve status of the Ciriaco, Mata Grande, 
and Extremo Norte forests in Tocantins. The three reserves will 
have to wait one year to be subject to a new demarcation by the 
Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural 
Resources. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 24 May

<F P=106> [Article by Marcelo Monteiro: "Dealing in Death"] </F>
  [Text] Enterprises in the First World are using tactical 
excuses to ship toxic materials to the Third World. Brazilian 
legislation has loopholes that permit the entry of such 
substances. But the mobilization of ecologists resulted in 
England for the first time being forced to receive return 
shipments of toxic elements sent to a factory in Sao Paulo. 
  Environmental engineers from 26 countries approved a 
recommendation to the governments of the Latin American nations 
urging them to prohibit the export of toxic and hazardous waste 
to Latin America, including waste that could theoretically be 
recycled. This proposal was one of the main conclusions of the 
Meeting on the Cross-Border Movement of Garbage and Toxic and 
Hazardous Waste organized in Santiago de Chile in November by 
the Economic Commission for Latin America (CEPAL), an agency 
linked to the UN, and by the Secretariat of the Basel 
Convention. The meeting was also attended by representatives 
from environmental defense agencies such as Greenpeace and the 
Caribbean Conservation Association. 
  Laws preventing the importing of toxic waste have been 
passed 
in 103 countries of the Third World. In Latin America, 
Argentina, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Peru, and Panama have 
legislation restricting toxic cargo traffic. The Organization of 
African Unity approved the Bamako Convention in 1991 prohibiting 
the importing of toxic garbage to the African signatory 
countries along with the sale of substances whose use is 
prohibited in the producing countries. 
  In the meantime, the great difficulty confronted by the 
nations of the Third World in preventing this "dealing in death" 
is the failure of the government to supervise the cargo normally 
shipped by Western European countries and the United States. 
According to Alfredo Gastal of the Environmental Department of 
CEPAL, in addition to passing restrictive laws, the countries of 
the Third World need to strengthen the organizational structure 
of institutions responsible for the environmental area and they 
must also train officials so that domestic legislation and 
international treaties may be complied with completely. 
  Brazil is not a member of the group of nations that prohibit 
the entry of toxic waste of any kind in its territory. 
Regulatory Decree 138 of the Brazilian Environmental Institute 
of Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) has some loopholes that 
permit the entry into Brazil of waste-containing metals such as 
zinc, lead, copper, chrome, among others, plus used batteries 
for "recycling" and waste coming from steel production. 
  The current standard forbids the importing of used tires, 
plastics, and chlorinated solvents. A company that wishes to buy 
waste from abroad must be registered with the IBAMA and submit 
an expert report from a government environmental agency 
establishing that it is capable of handling the products. 
  Brazilian legislation on importing toxic garbage can be 
improved with the help of the new regulation being analyzed by 
IBAMA and as a result of the passage of the bill on this topic 
introduced by Federal Deputy Sidney de Miguel (PV-RJ [Green 
Party--Rio de Janeiro]). The IBAMA standards will have to be 
spelled out during the first half of this year and it is 
probable that they will prohibit "any importing of waste except 
when there is a proven need," according to Biologist Leda Famer, 
who is in charge of the solid waste management program of that 
institute. The criterion for spelling out the rules will be 
"exclusively environmental," according to Leda. 
  Thanks to the exceptions provided for in the rules currently 
in force, IBAMA in 1993 approved the importing of 12,000 t of 
lead from the United States, Great Britain, Peru, and Puerto 
Rico. The lead waste is used by battery, fuse, and metal ingot 
manufacturers. The agency also authorized the entry of 35,000 t 
of scrap paper into the country. Brazil is self-sufficient in 
shredded paper production so that it was not necessary to import 
this waste, said Leda Famer. 
  In spite of the organizational problems relating to the 
inspection of toxic cargo shipped to Brazil, IBAMA managed to 
reduce the volume of imported aluminum scrap to 600 t by August 
1993. In 1991, the total exported to Brazil came to 6,254 t and 
the next year the figure was 3,380. The waste is processed in 
Brazil for the manufacture of radiators and aluminum alloys. 
  Sidney de Miguel's bill prohibits the importing and 
exporting--by Brazilian enterprises--of toxic waste "of any 
kind, even for recycling." According to the explanation, Brazil 
still allows the entry of toxic substances for reprocessing 
purposes, thus becoming "one of the last possible target 
countries for unscrupulous trafficking in toxic waste." 
  According to the bill, companies that would like to manage 
hazardous waste will have to prove that they have the technical 
capacity to do so before they can go ahead. They will have to be 
registered with the National Register of Hazardous Waste 
Operators to be monitored by environmental agencies, and they 
will have to submit a management plan to the government 
authorities. They will also annually have to inform the 
environmental agencies as to the quantity and nature of waste 
handled, its final destination, and any possible accidents. The 
bill defines the handling of hazardous waste without legal 
authorization or in an inadequate manner as a crime against the 
environment and public health; it calls for penalties ranging 
from six months to two years imprisonment for those responsible. 
  The representative of the Green Party in the Federal Chamber 
cited cases of damage caused by the irresponsible handling of 
toxic substances such as contamination--with mercury and 
lead--of at least 50 children in Vila dos Pescadores, in Cubatao 
(SP [Sao Paulo]) and secret dumps of HBC, known as drill dust in 
Cidade de Meninos, Caxias (RJ). 
  Due to current flaws in legislation and monitoring 
difficulties, the participation of the environmental defense 
society and agencies becomes fundamental in stopping this kind 
of traffic to the underdeveloped countries. The Brazilian 
section of Greenpeace at the end of 1993 prevented a load of 200 
t of waste containing heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, mercury, 
lead, among others) from being "recycled" by the Produquimica 
Enterprise based in Suzano (SP) for the production of 
fertilizer. The waste was not biodegradable, and if it had been 
used in agriculture, it could contaminate workers and consumers. 
  The Sao Paulo enterprise purchased a load from the British 
metallurgical firm of Beaver Metals located in Birmingham in the 
form of "micronutrient for fertilizer production." Alerted by 
Greenpeace, which analyzed the waste in Great Britain, the State 
Basic Sanitation Technology Company (CETESB) seized the cargo of 
10 containers in the port of Santos to check the product's 
makeup. Days later, a new lot of nine containers holding the 
same cargo arrived at the terminal in Sao Paulo. CETESB proved 
that the products were toxic. 
  Although it was toxic material, the cargo could have legally 
entered the country if Produquimica had been registered with 
IBAMA. Because the importing company did not take care of this 
legal obligation, CETESB had a tool for demanding the return of 
the cargo to England, a transaction that was completed in 
January. According to company owner Gerard Walter Schultz, 
importing micronutrients does not have to be authorized by 
environmental agencies because those nutrients are not 
characterized as toxic waste, something that was denied by the 
analysis done by CETESB. 
  The Sao Paulo enterprise was fined more than 20 times by 
CETESB for irregular dumping of waste in flowing waters, soil 
contamination due to improper storage of toxic material, 
exaggerated emission of particles into the atmosphere, and use 
of equipment without installation license issued by CETESB. 
Produquimica has until 30 June to transfer the Suzano factory 
located in a watershed protection area.

  [Text] Havana, 18 May (PL) -- The Higher Institute of 
Sciences and Technology [Instituto Superior de Ciencias y 
Tecnologia] today established an environment department, 
dedicated to the use of nuclear techniques to preserve and 
protect the environment. 
  Headed by Francisco Martinez Luzardo, a forestry expert and 
chemist by profession who holds a doctorate degree in the 
sciences of the use of residues, the department groups 
radiochemists, nuclear physicists, and technologists whose 
interests and research findings are related to the idea of 
sustainable development. 
  Martinez Luzardo told PRENSA LATINA that the department will 
promote environmental projects with stress placed on their 
economic feasibility. 
  In addition to conducting a nuclear analysis of the 
industrial waste and atmospheric pollution, the department seeks 
to develop and apply technologies to treat residual and natural 
waters and waters muddied with the waste of contaminating 
metals, as well as to lower the risks of human error in 
operating industrial processes, he explained. 
  The researchers discussed the main achievements in using the 
residues of salt plants, sawmills, and nickel factories and 
referred to the virtues of the products obtained: additives for 
fuel, anticorrosive products, purifying resins, and others. 
  At present, the department is conducting a joint program 
with 
Rio de Janeiro and Roraima Universities in Brazil on the 
protection of the environment, specifically on the use of 
radiotracers [radiotrazadores] to analyze residuals polluted by 
mercury.

<F P=106> [Andrew North article: "Saddam Drains Life From Arab </F>
Marshes"] 
  [Text] Southern Iraq's ancient marshlands, the largest 
wetland ecosystem in the Middle East, and home to the Marsh 
Arabs for nearly 5,000 years, will disappear within the next 10 
to 20 years if the Iraqi government continues to drain them. 
  That is the conclusion of a study of environmental changes 
in 
the marsh region, an area slightly smaller than Wales, carried 
out by a team of scientists. Of 5,800 sq miles of marsh and 
lake in 1985, 57 per cent had been turned into dry land by 1992, 
the authors claim. The evidence for this claim comes from 
detailed study of satellite images. This transformation has 
irreversibly damaged much of the wildlife of the marshland, 
which is classified as of global importance by the World Wide 
Fund for Nature (WWF). 
  The study dismisses Iraqi claims that the draining is 
necessary for agricultural purposes. It concludes that the 
engineering schemes "cannot result in any form of sustainable 
development and cannot be regarded in any way as a wise use of 
one of the world's most significant biological and cultural 
resources". 
  The central Qurnah marshes "essentially no longer exist as 
an 
ecosystem", says the co-ordinator of the report, Edward Maltby, 
head of the Wetland Ecosystem Research Group at Royal Holloway, 
University of London. Water that previously fed this marsh has 
been diverted since mid-1993 into a 42-milelong canal, known as 
the Mother of Battles project, and now flows into the Persian 
Gulf. 
  Dr Maltby's greatest concern is that the Hammar marsh, in 
the 
southern part of the region, will disappear. This would be a 
disaster, he says, because it is biologically the most diverse. 
More than half the flow of the Euphrates, which feeds this 
area, is now diverted before it reaches the Hammar marsh. A 
causeway constructed west of Qurnah in the last two years 
prevents water from the Mother of Battles canal feeding the 
marsh. 
  At risk in the Hammar and Hawizah marshes are 14 types of 
rare birds. They include two endemic species, the Iraq Babbler 
and the Basra Reed Warbler, according to Derek Scott, the 
ornithological specialist in the study team. 
  The draining disrupts the area's role as an important 
staging 
area for waterfowl, migrating between breeding grounds in 
Siberia and Central Asia, and winter quarters in Africa. 
Two-thirds of the water-fowl that winter in the Middle East do 
so in the Hammar and Hawizah marshes. Large flocks that would 
normally stay in the marshes have been reported in Saudi Arabia. 
Thousands of fish have died as the waters recede. Research in 
the 1970s recorded 58 species in the marshland lakes and 
waterways. 
  Further evidence of the scale of the changes in the 
geography 
of the marshes has come from recently released video footage and 
infra red photographs, taken by RAF [Royal Air Force] Tornados 
monitoring the southern no-fly zone that has been in place since 
August 1992. 
  They show the exact layout of the engineering works, such as 
the two diversions of the Euphrates near Samawah and 
al-Nasiriyah, and the Mother of Battles project. The 
photographs prove the existence of a new lake, which has formed 
this year because of an overflow from the Samawah diversion. 
This was first reported in February by Iraqi opposition groups. 
  Although the report pours scorn on the Iraqi government's 
economic justification for the draining, it does not speculate 
about alternative reasons. 
  Most observers believe that the engineering works have 
become 
part and parcel of Saddam Husayn's campaign to crush Shia 
insurgents operating from the marshes. Draining the marshes has 
allowed the Iraqis to penetrate their hideouts and use heavy 
artillery. 
  Since the collapse of the 1991 Shia uprising, thousands of 
people have been displaced from their homes in the region, or 
killed by the security forces. The Tornado images released by 
the Ministry of Defence back up these claims. They show large 
numbers of marshland villages on fire.

<F P=106> [Report by Liat Collins] </F>
  [Excerpt] Some 35,000 tons of hazardous waste have piled 
up at the Ramat Hovav toxic waste dump with no means for its 
disposal, the environment minister's adviser, Aharon Vardi, told 
the Knesset Interior and Environment Committee yesterday. 
  Environment Minister Yosi Sarid has ordered the purchase of 
an incinerator capable of destroying 15,000 tons of hazardous 
waste a year, but the ministry plans for all incineration to be 
carried out at another site within four years, Vardi said. 
  Committee chairman Yehoshu'a Matza (Likud) was surprised to 
learn from ministry Director-General Yisra'el Peleg the 
government had decided not to privatize the site. Matza said 
the toxic waste buried at the site threatens water sources and 
expressed concern over the recent discovery of radio-active 
waste at the site. 
  Matza was further shocked to discover that hazardous waste 
is 
being imported, despite the fact Israel has signed the Basel 
Treaty which restricts the international movement of this type 
of waste. The subject was raised by MK [Knesset Member] No'omi 
Blumental (Likud). 
  In response, the Environment Ministry's legal adviser, Bo'az 
Oren, said the treaty has not yet been ratified. After 
regulations have been authorized, no hazardous material will 
enter the country without the ministry's permission, Oren said, 
but in the meantime there is no restriction. He noted that 
although the treaty was signed in 1989, it was only ratified by 
the EC last month. 
  Matza asked that the ministry establish regulations as soon 
as possible to close the current loophole. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by N. A. Aybulatov, doctor of geographical </F>
sciences, RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] Institute of 
Oceanology, under rubric "Ecology": "Radioactive Burial Grounds 
in the Kara Sea"] 
  [Text] During recent decades the radioactivity of the seas 
has increased noticeably. The major reasons are nuclear weapons 
tests, the dumping of radioactive waste by nuclear plants 
(including the accidents at the Three Mile Island nuclear power 
plant in the United States and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant 
in Ukraine) and plants that process nuclear fuel, as well as 
accidents on ships and aircraft with nuclear power units or 
nuclear weapons, and the burial of radioactive waste in the 
marine environment. A situation that currently is especially 
alarming is the radioactive pollution of the Barents and Kara 
seas, which wash the northern shores of our country. What is the 
scope of this pollution and what caused it? 
<H5>  International Dumping </H5>
  The substantial radioactive pollution in the ocean is 
created 
by the dumping of radioactive waste directly into the water 
itself or on the bottom. Radioactive waste has been dumped in 50 
places in the North Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean (dumping at 
sea began in 1946 and was not stopped by an international 
moratorium until 1983). According to estimates made by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the total 
radioactivity of the seas is 46 PBq, or 1.24 MCi -- one PBq 
(pentabecquerel) = 1 x 10[.sup]15[/] Bq = 27,000 Ci (curies). 
  The total list of radioactive dumpings includes certain 
unpackaged dumps and liquid runoffs, which were widespread at 
sea as early as the 1950's-1960's. Of this list, 98 percent 
represent _g_- and _b_-radiating isotopes. 
  We might note that the IAEA estimates do not take into 
consideration the dumping at sea that was carried out by the 
former USSR. 
  Radioactive materials (not considering the USSR dumpings) 
were widespread in four oceans of the earth: 0.55 PBq are 
produced by waste products that were concentrated in 16 places 
in the northeastern part of the Pacific Ocean and near the 
western shore of North America; 2.94 PBq, in 11 places in the 
northwest Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico; 42.31 PBq, in 15 
places in the northeast Atlantic; and 0.002 PBq, in five places 
in the western part of the Pacific Ocean, near Japan and New 
Zealand. 
  The largest share of the dumping of radioactive waste at sea 
belongs to Great Britain. In the North Atlantic that share 
constitutes 77.5 percent of the total amount of dumped waste. 
The radioactive "contribution" made by that country to the 
marine environment is 35 PBq. Dumping by Switzerland constitutes 
10 percent of the total dumping; United States, 7.6 percent; 
Belgium, 4.6 percent; France, 0.8 percent;Netherlands, 0.7 
percent; Japan, 0.03 percent; Sweden, 0.01 percent; New Zealand, 
0.002 percent; and Germany, 0.0004 percent. 
<H5>  Dumping of Radioactive Waste in the Kara Sea </H5>
  The leadership of the former USSR used to assert that our 
country's enterprises did not dump radioactive waste at sea, 
and, if such dumping of radioactive waste did occur, it was 
without the knowledge of the authorities and was a violation of 
the law. But in response to demands to release information about 
dumping operations, they never gave any official answers, or, in 
any case, no reports ever appeared in the press. 
  However, thanks to the efforts of the public, as well as 
materials that were collected by nuclear physicist A. A. 
Zolotkov, a worker in the Murmansk Maritime Steamship Agency and 
former deputy to the USSR Supreme Soviet, it became known that 
in the USSR the dumping of radioactive waste in the Kara Sea had 
been carried out for more than 20 years (1964-1986). In the 
1980's A. A. Zolotkov prepared a map showing the location of 
radioactive graveyards in the Kara Sea, while stating that that 
map was by no means complete. 
  In late 1991 V. Ya. Stadnyuk, chairman of the USSR Supreme 
Soviet's Council of the Union Committee on Questions of 
Security, made two inquiries concerning the burial of 
radioactive waste --at the USSR Ministry of the Maritime Fleet 
and personally to the commander in chief of the USSR Navy. The 
answers to the inquiries were stupefying -- A. A. Zolotkov's 
unofficial research was completely confirmed. In response to the 
first inquiry, it was reported from Minmorflot [Ministry of the 
Maritime Fleet] that the burials of radioactive waste at sea 
(during the operation, repair, and modernization of 
nuclear-powered ships in the Murmansk Steamship Agency) were 
carried out from 1963 through 1986 in accordance with a decision 
made by the USSR Government. Special authorizations for this 
purpose were also given by the 3rd Main Administration of USSR 
Minzdrav [Ministry of Health), and, starting in 1971, the 
Medical Service of the Red Banner Northern Fleet (the government 
entrusted it with the task of monitoring the burial of 
radioactive waste in the arctic seas. 
  The burials occurred in the following regions: liquid 
radioactive waste, in the area of the Barents Sea with 
coordinates from 74 to 78 north latitude and from 
48 to 52 east longitude; solid radioactive waste, in 
areas of the Kara Sea (Zaliv Techeniya, Tsivolki, Abrosimova, 
Stepovogo, Oga, Blagopoluchiya, Sedova, as well as the 
deep-water area of the Novaya Zemlya Depression). For each area 
and each burial, the Medical Service of the KSF [Red Banner 
Northern Fleet established the maximum quantity of radioactive 
waste with regard to volume and total activity. The bulk of the 
waste that was buried during that period, according to USSR 
Minmorflot information, was in the category of weakly active 
radioactive waste. An exception was the burial of the first 
nuclear unit of the "Lenin" icebreaker, which was carried out in 
accordance with a special decree of the USSR Council of 
Ministers. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-006L-14A>      Key: Areas where solid radioactive waste was submerged in the Kara Sea. </FIG>


  1 - Novaya Zemlya Depression -- 1450 containers 
with radioactive waste, barge with malfunctioning nuclear 
reactor (170,000 Ci), transport barge for carrying liquid 
radioactive waste; 
  2 - Zaliv Neupokoyeva -- radioactive waste with a 
total activity of 3400 Ci; 
  3 - Zaliv Tsivolki -- 4750 containers, "Nikolay 
Bauman" transport barge, central compartment of "Lenin" 
icebreaker with three malfunctioning reactors and screen 
assembly; 
  4 - Zaliv Olga -- 850 containers; 
  5 - Zaliv Stepovogo -- 1850 containers and 
malfunctioning nuclear submarine (two reactors with fuel that 
had not been unloaded); 
  6 - Zaliv Abrosimova -- 550 containers and 
compartments of four malfunctioning submarines; 
  7 - Zaliv Blagopoluchiya -- 650 containers; 
  8 - Zaliv Techeniy -- malfunctioning reactor 
(without nuclear fuel), total activity 1856 Ci; 
  9 - 400 containers; 
  10 - 250 containers; 
  11 -proposed location of regional radioactive waste 
graveyard; 
  12 - area where it is proposed to carry out an extensive 
long-term nuclear testing program.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The following were buried in Zaliv Tsivolki (near Novaya 
Zemlya) in 1967: 
  -- an assembly of the first nuclear unit of the "Lenin" 
icebreaker, consisting of three reactors without nuclear fuel, 
with hermetically sealed standard equipment and biological 
protection that was mothballed in the assembly (steel with a 
thickness of 300 mm, concrete). The reliability and safety of 
the storage are estimated to be a period of no less than 500 
years; 
  -- cutout screen of one of the reactors with remnants of 
used 
fuel, which had been previously joined with a hardening mixture 
and mothballed in a reinforced-concrete container in a metal 
sheathing. Reliability and safety of the storage are estimated 
to be a period of no less than 500 years. 
  In conformity with instructions from USSR Goskomgidromet 
[State Committee for Hydrometeorology], the burial of 
radioactive waste in the Barents and Kara seas was subsequently 
discontinued (burial of liquid waste in 1984, and solid in 
1986). Detailed reports concerning all radioactive waste burials 
that were executed by the Murmansk Maritime Steamship Agency, 
with an indication of the quantity of waste products, their 
total activity, and the coordinates of the burial areas, are 
sent annually to the Medical Service of the Red Banner Northern 
Fleet. 
  In response to V. Ya. Stadnyuk's second inquiry concerning 
the burial of radioactive waste, it was reported from the Navy 
that A. A. Zolotkov's information was not complete, and it 
should be augmented by the burials of radioactive waste in the 
Pacific Ocean. 
  The preparation of a complete register of radioactive 
materials that had been buried by the former USSR Navy was 
completed in December 1991. However, the new Russian leaders at 
least until November 1992 failed to submit, despite their 
obligation, that register to the London Convention on Dumping. 
The international London Convention had been signed by the 
government of the former Union in January 1976, and it 
stipulates the taking into consideration of the IAEA 
recommendations when making decisions about the possibility of 
dumping radioactive waste. USSR Council of Ministers decree 
(March 1979), entitled "Measures to Guarantee the Execution of 
the Pledges Taken By the Soviet Side, Which Evolve From the 1972 
Convention on Preventing the Pollution of the Sea By Dumping of 
Waste and Other Materials" made USSR Goskomgidromet responsible 
for issuing special and general authorizations for dumping. (The 
statutes in the Convention do not apply to Navy ships, according 
to an explanation from MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs].) 
  In June 1983 rules were coordinated for dumping radioactive 
waste into the sea, with limitations concerning their activity, 
packaging, and disposal areas (it was not until 1985 that a 
Consultative Conference of the countries participating in the 
Convention adopted a resolution concerning a temporary 
moratorium on the burial of radioactive waste in the seas and 
oceans). Within the framework of the Russo-Norwegian commission 
for cooperation in the area of protecting the environment, in 
1992 a group of experts on the radioactive pollution of the 
Barents and Kara seas was created. In the summer of that year 
the first joint Russo-Norwegian expedition to the Kara and 
Barents seas occurred, with the direct participation of 
Roskomgidromet [RF Service on Hydrometeorlogy and Environmental 
Control]. 
  By providing false information to the London Convention, the 
Russian leaders violated international agreements on the 
disposal of nuclear waste at sea. Every opportunity to carry out 
an independent evaluation of the present-day situation with 
regard to radioactive burials was blocked. For example, all 
expeditions by the RAN Institute of Oceanology to the Barents 
and Kara seas in 1980-1990 that stipulated research in the 
disposal areas of nuclear waste were meticulously banned by the 
directive agencies. This is also attested to by the cruise on 
the "Solo" diesel ship, that belongs to the Greenpeace 
international organization, which had been given authorization 
to enter those areas after it had been towed to Murmansk... 
Total Activity of Radioactive Waste in the Kara Sea 
  As was already mentioned, detailed reports on all the buried 
radioactive waste from objects in the Murmansk Maritime 
Steamship Agency were sent to the KSF Medical Service. Evidently 
one can also find there data concerning burials of radioactive 
waste that were carried out by the USSR Navy. By using that data 
it should be possible to make a fairly accurate estimate of the 
radioactivity (in PBq) in the Kara Sea. However, independent 
experts are not even allowed to obtain that data. Realizing 
this, certain researchers make their own estimates of the 
radioactive pollution, and forecast the behavior of the 
radioactive waste in the marine environment of the Kara Sea. 
  A similar attempt, on assignment from Greenpeace, was made 
by 
the English nuclear physicist G. Large, who worked for 20 years 
at industrial nuclear sites. That researcher is well known as an 
excellent specialist in the dumping of radioactive waste in the 
seas and on nuclear technology. Usually it is no simple matter 
to estimate the total radioactive "inventory" of the reactors in 
submarines (radioactive equipment and fuel). The fact of the 
matter is that the radioactivity of the fuel is defined by the 
degree of irradiation and the enrichment of the fuel with 
uranium (U-235). By comparing American navy reactors with Soviet 
ones, G. Large provided an approximate estimate of the reactor 
fuel fillers and radioactive waste that are located in the Kara 
Sea. 
  Under the pressure of public opinion, Russian President B. 
N. 
Yeltsin in October 1992 issued an edict concerning the creation 
of a special commission (under the leadership of A. V. 
Yablokov), which was given the responsibility of establishing 
precisely and officially providing the London Convention on 
Dumping with materials concerning the burials of radioactive 
waste in the seas of Russia, including the Kara Sea. The 
commission included representatives of organizations that had 
taken part in the burials. Unfortunately, the list of 
organizations that had participated in the work did not include 
the Russian Academy of Sciences, so that, once again, there 
arise doubts relative to the objectivity and completeness of the 
information that was submitted. Now, when the commission has 
completed its work, A. V. Yablokov, adviser to the RF president 
on questions of ecology and the protection of health, and 
corresponding member of the RAN, has submitted the latest White 
Book, entitled "Facts and Problems Linked With the Burial of 
Radioactive Waste in the Seas That Wash the Territory of the 
Russian Federation." In that document it is stated that, in the 
North and the Far East, burials of liquid radioactive waste were 
carried out in five areas of the Barents Sea and nine areas of 
the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan, and the open part of the 
Pacific Ocean; and solid radioactive waste in eight areas near 
the coast of Novaya Zemlya and in the Kara Sea, and four areas 
in the Far East. 
  In 1959-1992 the total amount of liquid radioactive waste 
that was dumped into the northern seas, according to the 
commission's data, had a total activity of approximate 315 TBq 
(one TBq --tetrabecquerel = 1 x 10[.sup]12[/] Bq); and solid, 
a total activity (according to expert estimates as of the moment 
of burial) of approximately 590 TBq. In the Far East seas these 
values were, respectively, 12,300 and 6200 Ci. The items that 
represent potential danger first of all are the reactors of 
nuclear submarines and the nuclear "Lenin" icebreaker (total 
buried, 12 reactors and their parts without nuclear fuel, 
including three in the Far East) and seven in the malfunctioning 
state with nuclear fuel not unloaded (all in the north). The 
materials cited in the White Book will, of course, be submitted 
to the Secretariat of the London Convention and IAEA. 
<H5>  Sources of Radioactive Pollution </H5>
  There arises the question of the further fate of the 
radioactive waste in the Kara Sea. Judging by the official 
answers from Minmorflot, the packaging of the radioactive waste 
is designed for a sufficiently long period of time, estimated at 
500 years. But what will happen then? There is another 
disturbing fact: a large number of burials lie on the bottom of 
bays, at a shallow depth (up to 20 meters). In those places, 
according to data available to the author of this article, there 
is a rather intensive movement of fragmental material, as a 
result of which the packaging of the waste products corrodes and 
its thickness is reduced. This circumstance obliges 
oceanologists to insist on the carrying out within the near 
future of a careful study of the Kara graveyards with manned 
underwater apparatuses. According to our information, in 1993 it 
is planned to conduct research in radioactive waste disposal 
areas, in particular, in Zaliv Abrosimova, Zaliv Stepovogo, and 
Zaliv Tsivolki, as well as in the open part of the sea at 
location 7248' north latitude, 5818' east longitude. 
  The total quantity of radioactive substances in the waters 
of 
the Kara Sea is the result primarily of tests of nuclear bombs 
in the atmosphere and under water, which were carried out on 
Novaya Zemlya since 1956, and the penetration of radionuclides 
through cracks in the rocks during underground tests of nuclear 
weapons on Novaya Zemlya after the banning of tests in the 
atmosphere an in the sea. Radionuclides were detected during the 
first landing on the southern island by a Greenpeace group in 
October 1990. On the slope of a mountain close to an old mine 
shaft they found at least three "hot spots" with considerable 
radioactivity (more than 50 Bq/cm[.sup]2[/] with an overall 
background of approximately 12-15 Bq/cm[.sup]2[/]. The "hot 
spots" were located 400 meters from the shaft, and two 
kilometers from it the instrument readings fell to 1.6-1.8 
Bq/cm[.sup]2[/]. The high radiation in the shaft area, and 
the existence of "hot spots" there, indicate that products from 
underground tests have gotten into the atmosphere. 
  Another source of radionuclides in the Kara Sea is the 
disposals of waste products by the radiochemical plant in 
Windscale (England). The maximum concentration of [.sup]90[/] 
Sr in the waters entering the Barents Sea exceeds 
the global level by approximately a factor of 2. The time for 
carrying the radionuclides into the southwestern part of the 
Kara Sea, according to data provided by research in the 
expedition on the "Otto Shmidt" ship (1982) is 6.2 years. 
  The outflows of the Ob River serve as another, so far 
unevaluated, source of the radioactive pollution of the Kara 
Sea. They will have to be ascertained in future expeditions, 
including those of the RAN Institute of Oceanology. 
  As a result it is necessary, unfortunately, to assert that 
the former USSR violated the major requirements of the IAEA that 
pertain to the dumping of radioactive waste in the seas and that 
prescribe the burial of radioactive waste beyond the limits of 
the shelf (no closer than 200 miles from the shore) at a depth 
of no less than 4000 meters and only in the band of latitudes 
from 50 north latitude to 50 south latitude. There 
continue to be violations of the Russian Federation Law 
"Protection of the Environment" (December 1991). 
  All the research studies of the radiation situation after 
1967 were conducted in the waters located 50-100 km from the 
burial areas of solid radioactive waste. In those waste burial 
areas themselves, no monitoring of the radiation situation was 
carried out throughout a 25-year period, and the system of 
monitoring did not begin to be created until 1992. The items 
that represent the greatest potential radioecological danger are 
the reactors of nuclear submarines that were dumped in the 
shallow bays of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in the Kara Sea, 
and the screen assembly of the "Lenin" nuclear icebreaker with 
nuclear fuel that had not been unloaded. 
  What steps, then, should be undertaken to assure that the 
radioactive pollution does not intensify in the Kara Sea? In our 
opinion, it is necessary first of all to carry out the expensive 
and dangerous operation of raising the solid radioactive waste 
and burying it in special storage facilities on land.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17, RIA -- Japan will give financial aid 
to Russia for constructing a floating plant to utilise 
radioactive waste in the Russian Far East, the JAPAN TIMES 
reports today with references to governmental sources. In 
exchange for aid, Russia has promised to refrain from dumping 
waste in the Sea of Japan. The agreement was reached earlier 
this month. The project is worth several million dollars. 
Funds for this purpose are to be allocated from the amount of 
U.S. 100 million, which Japan promised to Russia and other 
republics of the former USSR for the elimination of nuclear 
weapons. It is planned that the project, where liquid waste is 
to be condensed into solid matter and then sent to land-based 
storages, will be completed early in 1995.

  [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 15 (CTK) -- Czech and 
Austrian environmentalists today handed the Czech and Austrian 
Presidents, Vaclav Havel and Thomas Klestil, a letter protesting 
against nuclear energy. 
  During the seven Central European presidents' stroll through 
Litomysl this afternoon, activists from the Czech movement 
Rainbow (Duha) and the Austrian movement Global 2000 unfolded 
banners with anti-nuclear inscriptions. 
  Klestil, who plans to discuss the nuclear energy issue with 
Havel, raised his thumb and smiled in support of the 
environmentalists' demands. 
  In the letter the environmentalists propose that the 
Litomysl 
summit adopt a resolution on the danger of using nuclear energy 
in Central Europe. 
  They call on the presidents to support cooperation in energy 
saving and in its effective use, and to press for the 
introduction of information exchange on nuclear facilities' 
operation. 
  The environmentalists also recommend that the presidents 
discuss opportunities of influencing neighbor countries' nuclear 
projects which could be dangerous to their populations. They 
are also asked to initiate international conferences on 
effective energy uses. 
  The letter does not directly mention the nuclear power plant 
which is now being built at Temelin, south Bohemia. Austrian 
environmentalists, supported by political parties, have been 
strongly protesting against its completion. The Soviet-type 
plant, to be equipped with Westinghouse safety technology, is 
located about 100 kilometers from the Austrian border.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "EU: Strong </F>
Support for Technologies Which Transform Solar Energy Directly 
Into Electricity at Conference"] 
  [Text] Amsterdam, 14 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) - The 12 
European Photovoltaic Solar Energy (PV) Conference, in Amsterdam 
this week under the auspices of the European Commission and 
which ends on Friday, enabled some 1,200 scientists, engineers, 
industrialists and politicians from some sixty countries from 
throughout the world to examine how one could maximise the 
methods for directly transforming solar energy into electricity. 
At the centre of the debate lay the research and development 
into more effective, less vulnerable and especially less 
expensive photovoltaic cells. Around 600 projects of concrete 
application of solar energy were presented in Amsterdam; the 
European Commission presented, notably, the efforts it had made 
in the field through the THERMIE programme (and THERMIE II has 
just been proposed by the Commission, see yesterday's EUROPE, 
p.8). The European Commission will continue to support the 
development of renewable energies, said the Commission's 
representatives in Amsterdam: in the 4th Research 
Framework-Programme (1995-98) over Ecu 1 billion is provided for 
research, development and demonstration programmes into 
non-nuclear energy, of which 60% into renewable energy 
sources. 
Hendrik Tent of the Commission's DG XII, said that a large part 
of these funds would be used for developing photovoltaic solar 
energy. Wolfgang Palz (DG [Directorate General] XII), moreover, 
announced that the European Commission intended to present a new 
programme soon entitled "Power for the World", whose aim will 
mainly be to support the implementation of photovoltaic solar 
energy projects in countries of the Third World. In this 
context, the Conference criticized the loan policy of 
multilateral financing organizations towards Third World 
countries for relying too heavily on the extension of large 
conventional energy production and grid connections, without 
taking account of ecological difficulties, the enormous cost of 
infrastructures, etc. in these countries. Funds would be better 
used for energy generated decentrally and distributed 
independently: photovoltaic solar energy is considered to be a 
more suitable solution, most agreed. "The efforts of the 
European Union and its Member States are not enough", said the 
president of the European Association for Solar Energy 
(EUROSOLAR), Herman Scheer, deploring the fact that nuclear 
energy still occupied a privileged place compared to alternative 
energies where Community funding was concerned. The current 
President of the Environmental Council of the European Union, 
Greek Minister Elisabeth Papazoi deplored the fact that solar 
energy was encouraged so little: "Everyone knows the answer, but 
no one wants to give it. Everyone wants solar energy, but only a 
few are engaged. Most agree that renewable energy deserves more 
money, but funding is insignificant". The Netherlands' Economic 
Minister, Dr. J.E. Andriessen, stressed the great ecological 
advantage of renewable energy in which production is not 
accompanied by carbon dioxide emissions or other polluting 
gasses. If converting solar energy into electricity is still too 
expensive to be applied on a wide scale, it should, after the 
year 2010, be the most widespread form of renewable energy in 
the world, said Mr. Andriessen. The Netherlands currently 
produces 1,000 kilowatts in photovoltaic solar energy; in 2010, 
it ought to produce 250 megawatts, he estimated. On the fringe 
of the Conference, the Becquerel Award was attributed to the 
American scientist Morton B. Price for his work and in 
particular for the invention of the first cell with a 10% 
yield 
in 1954 and the Bell solar battery. EUROPE recalls that the 
Becquerel Award has been awarded by the Commission since 1989 to 
a person having contributed in an extraordinary way to 
developing photovoltaic solar energy.

"Ruberti and Fereres Sign Agreement Establishing EU'S 
Prospective Technological Institute in Seville"] 
  [Text] This Friday [16 April] European Commissioner Antonio 
Ruberti and the Spanish State Secretary Elias Fereres signed the 
agreement establishing the European Union's Prospective 
Technological Institute of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in 
Seville. Professor Ruberti pointed out that, "This institute is 
a key element in the mechanism for studying and following up 
scientific and technological evolution and evaluating the 
research policy choices which the Commission is in the process 
of making. A collaboration agreement between the Institute 
(which will be built in the Cartuja Technological Park) and the 
University of Seville has also been signed; and a European 
Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG) will be set up. The 
Prospective Institute is one of the CCR's eight institutes, each 
specialising in a particular area (environment, tele-detection, 
advanced materials, etc.) carrying out part of their activities 
in the framework of the specific programmes of the Community R 
and D framework programme. The Prospective Institute will work 
closely with bodies specialising in prospective study and 
technological observation which are members of the ETAN network 
that is part of the future programme of socio-economic research 
proposed under the 4th framework programme 1994/99. In the 
coming years, it will set up a European observatory for science 
and technology (OEST) which will work with similar national and 
European bodies to collect, process and disseminate information 
on R and D policies in the industrialised countries and their 
evolution. A system of technological observation will also be 
developed to detect new scientific break-throughs and 
technological innovations at an early stage and to alert persons 
in charge of such areas of the existence of these new 
developments.

"Strengthening of Cooperation To Clean up Eastern Europe"] 
  [Text] It is vital for cooperation in the area of the 
environment to be "strengthened in order to avoid unfair 
competition on the basis of dramatically low environmental 
standards," claimed Ioannis Paleokrassas the EU Environment 
Commissioner on April 26. Attending a conference organised by 
Forum Europe on the theme of "the Greening of Eastern Europe," 
the Commissioner added "we cannot afford to let Central and 
Eastern Europe's environment slip down the European agenda." He 
said that EU standards and practices such as environmental 
impact assessment, as well as the polluter-pays principle "would 
have to be implemented step by step in the candidate countries." 
  The Romanian Environment Minister Aurel Constantin Ilie was 
also attending the Forum Europe conference, and held talks with 
the Commissioner. He felt that for there to be any chance of 
Eastern Europe being "cleaned up" in the near future, the West 
would have to finance projects and give access to the necessary 
modern technologies.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Environment: `Northern' Front </F>
Against Dangerous Substances"; as released by Brussels 
MULTINATIONAL SERVICE in English] 
  [Text] Things have reached the point where these days the 
positions taken on the environment by national representatives 
to the Council of Ministers have lost the capacity to surprise. 
Now, once again, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands are 
making a common cause to ban the sale of hazardous products - in 
this particular case creosote and chlorine-based solvents - 
while the other EU Member States are trying to find a compromise 
which will maintain the right of free movement for these 
products within the Union. Meanwhile, the ruling which the 
Court of Justice is expected to hand down in the next few weeks 
on the German ban on PCP [pentachlorophenol] is awaited with 
growing anxiety. 
  In March, the European Commission put forward its amended 
proposal for a Directive "amending for the 13th time Directive 
76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and 
administrative provisions of the Member States relating to 
restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous 
substances and preparations." The new draft Directive basically 
aims to restrict sale and use of three types of substance which 
represent a health hazard to consumers: carcinogenic, mutagenic 
and toxic substances, creosote and its derivatives and lastly 
solvents with a chlorine base. 
  A first meeting of national experts within the Council of 
Ministers on the proposals has already taken place, but did not 
manage to settle all the problems, especially as regards 
creosote and its derivatives. These wood treatment products 
have a detrimental effect on human health and the environment, 
mainly due to the toxic ingredient BAP 
[benzyl-para-aminophenol]. The Commission has proposed limiting 
BAP in wood treatment in industrial installations to 500 ppm 
[parts per million], that is, about 0.05 percent. 
  Denmark, however, wants nothing to do with setting limits on 
BAP. It simply wants to see a ban on sale and use of creosote. 
The stance of Germany and the Netherlands is rather less 
extreme: these two Member States are calling for a ban on 
creosote sales to the public at large. For treating wood within 
industrial installations, they are prepared to go along with a 
ceiling on BAP, but much lower than the Commission's proposal, 
at 50ppm, or 0.005 percent, and are demanding an even lower 
ceiling, at 5ppm BAP, for wood treatment in general. Whatever 
the case, Germany is calling for a total ban on BAP in tar-oil. 
The Dutch have given to understand that they see a reduction in 
BAP limits as a vital issue, given that their country makes 
massive use of treated wood in its canal and inland waterway 
installations. The Dutch are set to vote against the Directive 
if the ceiling is not brought down to the lower levels they 
recommend, and in any case have made it clear that if their 
concerns are not heeded they will invoke Article 100a 4 of the 
Maastricht Treaty, following the example set by Germany for PCP, 
which allows for derogations to the principle of free movement 
set in Article 100a on the grounds of environmental protection. 
  This question, which is of prime importance for the future 
of 
free movement, and environmental protection within the European 
Union, is currently before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg. 
The Advocate-General has already given his Opinion, in January, 
on the individual case where the Commission authorised Germany 
to impose a ban on PCP, following notification procedures laid 
down in Article 100a4. He did not, however, pronounce on the 
underlying legal principle. Meanwhile, industrial circles 
waiting to see how much weight the European Court will give to 
environmental protection, which has the status of a mere 
ancillary policy area, as against the principle of free 
movement, which is one of the basic principles of the European 
Union. 
  On the other side of the fence, the Greeks, French and 
Spanish, together with the UK and the Commission, are against 
any restrictions on free movement, and are taking up a stance 
diametrically opposed to that of the "Northern" bloc. 
  As regards chlorine-based solvents (which have carcinogenic 
properties), the Commission is proposing a ban, except in the 
case of three substances for which substitutes are not readily 
available - methyl chlorate, perchlorethylene and 
trichloroethylene. But the same scenario presents itself here, 
with Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands calling for an 
outright ban, while the other Member States are prepared to go 
along with the Commission, which has undertaken to table 
proposals on these three substances within three years.

"Denmark To Host CEEC Conference on the Environment"] 
  [Text] Fourteen Environment Ministers from Central and East 
European countries (CEEC) are to join representatives from 
international banks and the European Commission from 1 to 3 June 
in Copenhagen at the invitation of Denmark, Danish Minister for 
the Environment Sven Auken announced on 9 May. The Minister 
explained that the conference would be focusing on ways of 
protecting the environment and methods for persuading the 
international banks to grant favourable loans at lower rates of 
interest for investment into environmental protection in the 
CEEC region. "If the banks -- the World Bank, the European 
Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development [EBRD] -- were prepared to shave just a few basis 
points off their standard rates for East Europe, that would give 
a substantial boost to investment in environmental protection 
measures in the region," Mr. Auken argued. Last year, he 
castigated the EBRD for supporting only commercial undertakings 
in Central and East European countries, and for ignoring the 
worrying issue of environmental damage in the region. 
  Denmark is playing host to this meeting because of its "good 
cooperation with East European countries," stressed Mr. Auken, 
adding that Denmark is "the country which has contributed most 
towards helping the region in environmental matters." The Danish 
Government granted direct aid worth 180 million Kroner (USD 
US27.7 million) for environmental projects in the CEEC region in 
1993, and has already contributed 300 million Kroner (USD US46.2 
million) in 1994.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE ENERGY: "Nuclear </F>
Safety: East Europe Persists in Reliance On Risky Nuclear Power 
Plants] 
  [Text] As European Union concern grows over the safety of 
Chernobyl, in the face of Ukrainian reluctance to close the 
nuclear plant, and Western companies continue to balk at 
upgrading other dangerous East European plants until civil 
liability issues are resolved, the countries of the former 
Eastern bloc are still resolutely embracing nuclear power. 
  Attempts by the West to convince them to shut their most 
suspect nuclear installations are generally countered with 
arguments that this is not possible until alternative sources of 
energy are found. Ahead of the Council of EU Foreign Ministers 
on May 16, which discussed nuclear assistance to the Ukraine, 
Kiev declared it would need some ECU 6-8 billion to shut down 
the Chernobyl plant -- more than double the estimate the 
authorities gave a fortnight earlier. In Slovakia, by contrast, 
President Michal Kovac declared on 13 May that there were 
alternatives to a nuclear future for Central and Eastern Europe. 
<H5>  Close Chernobyl Campaign </H5>
  On 16 May, French President Francois Mitterrand added his 
voice to those calling for the aid to halt Chernobyl and other 
unsafe East European nuclear plants from the Group of Seven 
major industrialised countries, when their leaders meet in 
Naples for the Western Economic Summit in July. "These dangers 
have to be countered, because tens of nuclear installations 
could explode at any moment," he said. G-7 finance and strong 
political will were needed to protect the whole of Europe "from 
catastrophes whose consequences I dare not even imagine," Mr. 
Mitterand said. 
  May 16 also saw the creation by Belgian scientific and 
medical experts, including former International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) President Rene Constant, of a Committee for the 
Closure of Chernobyl. The Committee insists it is "not 
anti-nuclear." It wants to see the setting up of a European 
Foundation which will coordinate scientific and technical 
assistance for decontaminating the Chernobyl region. Eight 
years after the Chernobyl disaster, underground water 
contamination from 600 provisional nuclear waste storage sites, 
the departure of Russian doctors and the fragility of the 
Ukrainian health system are preventing victims of radiation from 
receiving proper treatment. 
<H5>  East European Nuclear Plans </H5>
  Meanwhile, Bulgaria's National Electricity Company has 
announced it is to invest a further ECU 200 million to modernise 
the accident-prone Soviet-style Kozloduy nuclear plant. MEPs 
have on various occasions voiced fears that the plant can never 
be brought up to EU safety standards. In Slovakia, the 
government is envisaging a prolongation of the life of two more 
Soviet-style VVER 440s at Jaslovske Bohunice until the year 2005. 
  Next year, Romania expects to commission its first nuclear 
reactor at Cernavoda, on the banks of the Danube and less than 
1,000 km from Chernobyl. With EU and international pressure on 
the Ukraine to close the latter for good and doubts about 
Kozloduy persisting, the Romanian Government has made no secret 
of its desire eventually to export its nuclear power to 
neighbouring countries. The Cernavoda plant, began under the 
Ceausescu regime in 1981, will cost some ECU 600 million and 
supply 10 percent of Romania's electricity. Since 1991, an 
Italian-Canadian consortium brought into the project has spent a 
third of its time simply checking the work completed previously. 
The IAEA is keeping a close eye on the proceedings. 
<H5>  Austrian Anxieties </H5>
  In the firing line of any future nuclear disaster, 
prospective EU member Austria is, along with Germany, 
spearheading calls for the definite closure of existing nuclear 
plants in neighbouring Central and East European countries and a 
halt to construction already underway there. Vienna will thus 
take some comfort from the declaration on 13 May by Slovak 
President Michal Kovac, who said his long-term aim was a Central 
Europe without nuclear power plants. 
  "Nuclear energy is not the only alternative" for producing 
electricity, Mr. Kovac said. The Slovak President's comments 
came on the eve of a visit to Vienna. He confirmed that the 
controversial Slovak plant at Bohunice, some 40 kms from the 
Austrian border, "will be closed down in 2002." However, 
contrary to Austrian wishes, the more modern Mochovce 
installation currently under construction to the East of 
Austria, will still be brought on stream, Mr. Kovac said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Chernobyl </F>
Worries Should Not Detract From Problems Within EU."] 
  [Text] Brussels, 30 May 94 (Agence Europe) - At the debate 
held by the Energy Council last Wednesday on nuclear safety in 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe (see EUROPE of 27 May, 
p.9), the Irish Minister for Transport, Energy and 
Communications, Mr. Brian Cowen, invited his colleagues not to 
allow concern on Chernobyl and on nuclear safety in Eastern 
Europe as a whole to make one lose sight of the nuclear risk 
within the European Union [EU] itself. 
  Mr. Cowen called for the EU to set up a nuclear inspectorate 
to verify the safety of power plants within the EU. According 
to the Irish Minister, the "lack of political will" to create 
such an inspection system in Europe "weakens the moral authority 
of the European Union." "Ireland attaches the greatest possible 
importance to nuclear safety matters. We should look to 
developments within the European Union as well as voicing 
concern about stations in Eastern Europe and notably in former 
Soviet Union. I have a deep concern about installations closer 
to home and particularly at Sellafield. Concern about Chernobyl 
should not blind us to the problem of Sellafield", said Mr. 
Cowen.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Cost of Fiscal </F>
Reductions for Bio-Fuels is Reasonable, Says Scrivener"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 27 May (Agence Europe) - In the framework 
of the first European Forum on Bio-Fuels in Tours (France) 
earlier this month, the Commissioner responsible for taxation, 
Mrs. Scrivener, said that low taxation on bio-fuels over ten 
years and in all Member States would cost the Community budget 
ECU 33 billion. "This measure is neither overly expensive, nor 
threatening to other productions", she said, recalling that the 
"long-term objective does not exceed 5 percent of fuel 
consumption in Europe". The so-called "Scrivener" proposal, 
whose goal is to generalize the fiscal advantages granted since 
1993 to bio-fuel products in the framework of pilot projects by 
making them compulsory in all Member States and no longer 
limiting them simply to these projects, is now on the table of 
the Ecofin Council. The Council will have to decide through 
unanimity and, according to Mrs. Scrivener, the decisive stage 
will occur between now and the summer. The Twelve should, 
notably, agree to confirm the compulsory nature of the measure 
proposed or, according to the wishes of the European Parliament, 
make it optional. For the moment, they are divided: some 
Member States are indeed tending towards this latter option, but 
others are ready to accept a compulsory lower taxation on these 
fuels as, without that, they fear traffic will be defected and 
thus a loss in fiscal revenue.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Solar Energy </F>
Policy Criticised"] 
  [Text] The Foundation for the Natural Heritage in Europe 
(Euronatur) has criticized research conducted in Germany and the 
European Union in promoting solar energy "which risks losing 
Europe one of the most important markets for the future." 
Contrary to the Japanese, which has set up large support 
programmes for developing solar energy, "Western Europe is 
continuing to waste billions" by betting on nuclear energy, 
thereby running the risk of leaving this large market to the 
Japanese, says no Euronatur. Another harmful consequence of 
this policy is that Eastern European countries should thus miss 
a "unique opportunity "of succeeding in their change in energy 
policy. Euronatur mentions as a concrete example the EU project 
to support the construction of two nuclear power plants in 
Ukraine and adds: "It is a scandal that public funds continue 
to be spent in the wrong directions." Euronatur deplores the 
fact that the promotion of solar energy is not mentioned in EU 
assistance programmes for Eastern Europe, which shows "that 
assistance programmes seem to have been conceived in cooperation 
with the nuclear lobby."

<F P=106> [Article by Gerard van Nifterik: "Catalyst With UV Light Let </F>
Loose On Nitrogen Oxides"] 
  [Text] Hannover -- A German photo catalytic process using 
ultraviolet light is being utilized to remove nitrogen oxides 
from exhaust fumes. Researchers at the University of Hannover 
developed a process which eliminates nitrogen oxides 
(NO[.sub]x[/]) in exhaust fumes. 
  Nitrogen oxides are released during the burning process. 
Combustion engines are therefore major contributors to the 
emissions of NO[.sub]x[/]. In this country, road traffic is 
by far the largest source of NO[.sub]x[/]. 
  Although it is not yet fully clear how efficient the German 
process is, the researchers are forecasting that it will be able 
to compete with existing methods such as selective catalysis and 
non-catalytic reduction. 
  The technique which has been developed in Hanover sends 
exhaust gases through a titanium dioxide catalyst bed. A 150 
Watt UV lamp has been placed in the same bed. The combination 
of ultraviolet light and the catalyst ensure that the 
NO[.sub]x[/] is then broken down into harmless nitrogen and 
oxygen. Hanover uses grains of TiO[.sub]2[/] with an average 
size of around 200 microns. Experiments have shown that a 20 
centimeter TiO2 column already does a very good job. 
Concentrations of NOx of approximately 1,400 ppm [parts per 
million] can reportedly be reduced by 50 to 70 percent. The 
addition of ammonia could even lead to a reduction of 100 
percent. No similar research into the use of UV light in 
catalysts is taking place in the Netherlands. Instead, IMET-TNO 
(the Institute for Environmental and Energy Technology in the 
Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research) in 
Apeldoorn is involved in the purification of industrial flue 
gases using UV light. The accent here lies primarily on low 
concentrations of hydrocarbons (up to 0.5 grams per cubic 
meter). An employee at the TNO institute reports that in the 
near future it will also be used for degrading nitrogen oxides.

<F P=106> [Article by Christa Friedl: "First Road Signs </F>
Through the Cleanup Maze"] 
  [Text] [First para is editor's 
summary] VDI-N, Duesseldorf-- Pollution cleanup has reached a 
crisis. In many cases there is no suitable procedure, more often 
there is a lack of money, but usually the real inhibiting factor 
is the lack of clear standards for the evaluation and cleansing 
of contaminated soils. The planned Federal soil protection law 
is intended to help. 
  At least in East Germany toxic waste cleanup is not failing 
for lack of money: the Union has provided funds of DM1 billion 
annually for cleansing the soil of privatized companies over the 
next 10 years. There are also billions for toxic waste cleanup 
for large-scale chemical firms, for lignite and shipyards. 
According to the Federal Environmental Agency in Berlin (UBA) a 
total of DM15 billion is available through the end of the 90's. 
But experiences in the new Federal Laender show that full 
coffers do not necessarily set off cleanup activities: "What is 
still missing," explains UBA expert Dr. Karin Freier, "are 
uniform bases and standards for investigation, evaluation and 
cleanup." 
  So far toxic waste cleanup has been the business of the 
Laender. The result is that the danger from a particular piece 
of ground is evaluated in quite different ways. In practice it 
is quite routine for toxic waste to be eliminated in one Federal 
Land at great expense, while the neighboring Land would hardly 
have noticed it. "In Germany we have 16 different methodologies 
for toxic waste cleanup," agreed Freier at the Technical 
University in Berlin at the end of February. 
  An investigation of the Hygiene Institute of the Ruhr Area 
in 
Gelsenkirchen supports this lack of uniformity with some 
statistics. It says that so far there are 37 different lists of 
toxic materials, and 24 of them contain quite different values 
for testing, cleanup and threshold values for certain 
pollutants. In addition there are about two dozen different EDP 
models for risk evaluation on the market. 
  Legislators are hving a hard time with regulatory efforts 
for 
toxic waste cleanup: The Federal Environmental Agency has been 
working on Technical Guidelines on Toxic Waste for four 
years--so far without results. The draft of the Federal Soil 
Protection Law proposed last summer now offers a concrete legal 
starting point. Freier says, "For the first time there is the 
possibility of establishing unified Federal standards for 
dealing with toxic soil changes and toxic wastes." 
  The alpha and omega of such unified Federal standards are 
the 
establishment of "use-dependent testing and response," i.e. 
threshold values for toxins which both give information about 
how great the risk from a polluted piece of ground is and also 
determine whether a surface must be cleaned up or not. At a 
technical discussion in April experts from the Laender will 
discuss the derivation of such values for testing and response. 
  At what level does a material begin to be harmful to health? 
Socalled TRD values (TRD stands for tolerable resorbable dosage 
rate in micrograms per kilogram and day) give information about 
this question. A TRD value determines the highest level of 
absorption at which no deleterious effects on health are to be 
expected, or, in the case of carcinogens, at which there is a 
low risk of becoming ill. Last year the UBA published TRD values 
for 82 materials and groups of materials relevant to toxic 
waste. "Still," according to Freier, "there continues to be a 
great need for research on toxicological effects." And the 
question of how different toxins work in combination is not yet 
answerable in most cases. According to the UBA, a research 
project now in progress is to produce the first findings on such 
combined effects by fall. 
  Test values also depend essentially on the later use of the 
decontaminated area. Thus Dr. Ulrich Ewers of the Hygiene 
Instititute of the Ruhr Area distinguishes three groups: 
children's playgrounds, residential areas and park facilities on 
the one hand, areas in horticultural and agricultural use on the 
other, and in addition commercial and industrial areas. The 
values suggested by the Institute for residential areas are 
twice as high as those for children's playgrounds; the factor 
for park and recreational facilities is five, for commercial and 
industrial areas 10 (see table). 
  Objectivity and professionalism are rarities in the public 
discussion of toxic waste, but they are the basis on which the 
new soil protection law is built. "The goal of the investigation 
of dubious areas is not knowledge of the potential for 
contamination, but of the potential risk arising from it," as 
Karin Freier at the Technical University put it. In other words, 
if a soil is contaminated, but the toxins are so tightly bound 
that they cannot escape into the air or into the subsoil water, 
the dubious area does not necessarily have to be declared a 
toxic waste site.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans D. Sauer: "Foreign Sales </F>
Support Duales System: 50 Percent of Packaging From "Yellow Ton" 
is Exported"] 
  [Text][First para is editor's summary] VDI-N, 
Duesseldorf--The company Duales System Deutschland GmbH 
announced "Sales Quotas Exceeded." But closer inspection reveals 
that this result was only possible because of massive exports of 
used packaging. Experts are looking for clearer conditions for 
sales in Germany from the planned amendment to the packaging 
ordinance. 
  On 1 March the environmental secretaries of the Laender were 
given extensive reading materials. Duales System Deutschland 
(DSD) presented them for the first time with the bulk flow 
documentation for the collection, sorting and sale of 
merchandise packaging. In the eyes of DSD managing director 
Wolfram Brueck the balance is favorable. Of 7.6 million tons of 
used packaging, 4.6 million tons were collected in 1993 through 
Duales System and an even 3.9 million tons were sold after 
sifting and sorting. According to Brueck, of 970,000 tons of 
plastic packages 29 percent were sold, while the packaging 
regulations require only 9 percent. 
  Indeed, the high rate of sales for plastics really is a 
surprise. After all, in the previous year problems with plastic 
waste had brought Duales System to the verge of disaster. The 
Society for Plastics Recycling founded by DSD and by the waste 
management sector found a bungled situation: 80,000 tons of 
plastic wastes were piling up in the sorting plants with no 
processing capabilities to deal with them. The mountain grew at 
the rate of 8000 tons a week. 
  The solution of the riddle: overseas sales. According to DKR 
chief executive Michael Scriba, a total of 225,000 tons of 
plastic wastes were exported in 1993. About 20,000 tons went to 
European Union countries, but the main sales region is Eastern 
Europe. Increasingly the Germans are collecting for China: the 
IPK for Paper and Plastic Usage GmbH in Sinzheim near 
Baden-Baden exported around 72,000 tons to the People's Republic 
in 1993. According to agent Dirk Gantzkow, the shipments went 
predominantly to a large factory in the city of Nanchang in the 
Chinese province of Jiangzi. In 1994 it is hoped to double the 
amount exported. "Without export possiblities for plastics 
Duales System would no longer exist," as Scriba freely admits. 
China is a particularly attractive location for utilization of 
plastics for two reasons. Wages are so low that intensive 
secondary sorting is possible. In addition, the consumers are 
very undemanding about the appearance and condition of plastic 
products, so that the sales possibilities for objects in daily 
use made of used plastics are practically unlimited. 
  German and foreign businesses which want to process the DSD 
plastics have to be approved by the TUeV (Technical Control 
Board). According to Andreas Burkhardt of the TUeV for the 
Rhineland, in Cologne, 106 German firms and 107 foreign ones had 
been through an initial testing process by the beginning of the 
year and had obtained a certificate as DSD plastic users. Today 
the DKR has access to TUeV-tested and contractually guaranteed 
processing capacities of 510,000 in Germany and abroad. Although 
for the moment no bottlenecks are in sight, plastics remain the 
problem child for Duales System. 
  Plastic packaging is a highly developed special product 
adapted to the protection and transport of a wide assortment of 
materials, but not to a trouble-free reuse. That is why the 
recycling costs for plastic are far higher than for other 
packaging materials. The leader of the Information Center for 
Packaging, Packaging Optimization and Environment at the Berlin 
Technical Training College, Dieter Berndt, estimates that only 
15 to 20 percent of plastic packaging can be reworked into new 
products at a tolerable cost. In this regard, he says that the 
high utilization quotas cited by DSD are a questionable success. 
"An expensive field experiment is being performed on the 
population of the Federal Republic," Berndt criticizes. Berndt's 
colleague Marcus Thiele points out a "construction error" in 
Duales System itself. The sorting companies in the disposal 
economy are not paid according to the results of their work but 
according to the quantity put in. Thus there is no incentive to 
separate as efficiently as possible. 
  Theo Becker, the managing director of BFI Disposal 
Technology 
from the business group RWE Disposal, complains that this is why 
the sorters also have no interest in improving the technical 
standards of their plants. At present the contents of the Yellow 
Sacks are divided roughly by hand at the 600 sorting stations of 
the disposal industry into the following categories: foil, 
bottles, cups and blisters, and foam packaging. The sizable 
residue, 46 percent, is made up of mixed plastics. BFI, in 
contrast, offers a technology which can distinguish individual 
products such as a certain mouthwash bottle using a multisensor 
system which sorts according to form, color, metal content, and 
infrared reflection. 
  Given the current quality of sorted plastic wastes, buyers 
can only be found if a socalled utilization contribution is 
paid. These additional payments are so attractive that even in 
Germany a lively competition for DSD plastics has evolved. "If 
all the plans which utilization businesses in the DKR have 
proposed so far were to be put into practice, we would need two 
million tons of plastic packaging," Scriba notes. 
  There is no shortage of ideas about how to manufacture 
substitute products for wood and concrete in horticulture and 
road construction from the problematic mixed plastics. But the 
market possibilities are often recklessly overestimated in the 
process. "The Federal Republic would have to be transformed into 
a plastic Legoland, covered with a thick layer of plastic paving 
stones--it would probably float," says Scriba mockingly. 
  A process used by the Finnish company Suomon Muovikartonki 
Oy 
for working unsorted and uncleaned plastics into road surfacing 
appears very attractive. The shredded waste products are broken 
down by heating and used in the manufacture of asphalt, with 
bitumen as a binding agent. Five to seven tons of plastic waste 
could be incorporated in a road surface measuring 1 km by 8 m. 
using this method. The company claims that the plastic-modified 
asphalt is more durable than normal road surfaces. The Krefeld 
concrete block manufacturer Hans Klausmann likewise hopes to 
combine sand and plastics at temperatures from 150 to 200 C 
to producing road construction materials. But Heinrich Els, an 
expert at the German Asphalt Association, finds the concept of 
using road construction as a method of disposal troubling. He 
says that asphalt is characterized by the fact that old road 
surfaces can be completely reused after appropriate treatment. 
"This should not be jeopardized by new additives." 
  Which way the Green Dot will roll in the future will be 
determined in no small measure by political decisions. The 
Federal Environmental Agency is working on an amendment to the 
packaging ordinance which defines the possibilities for 
utilization of used packaging more precisely, but experts 
estimate that the amendment will not be passed before the 
elections. "The position is rather confused," Kai Fabig, 
spokesperson of the environmental agency in Hamburg, agrees. But 
packaging technology expert sees positive aspects to the 
situation: "Everything is fluid at the moment."

<F P=106> [Article by Paola De Paoli: "Awward Goes to Paper Made From </F>
Seaweed"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Finally, Fabrizio De Poli's 
project for a system to manufacture paper from seaweed 
predominated in the "Environmental Technology" thematic section. 
This system is already being used at the Favini paper-mill in 
Rossano Veneto. 
  The technology of this process, which has gone into its 
first 
production stage, is completely Italian. Favini Managing 
Director Clemente Nicolucci added that the seaweed paper project 
has also been approved as part of the EC's LIFE [expansion 
unknown] program for the so-called clean technologies, and that 
there are plans for further joint studies to be made by ENEA 
[National Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and the 
Environment], the Lisbon Institute of Agronomy, and the Favini 
paper mill. 
  About 50,000 tonnes of excess seaweed come out of Venice's 
lagoon each year. This has been systematically collected by the 
Venezia Nuova consortium since 1989. As well as avoiding 
unpleasant smells and ecological unbalances, it means saving 
about 30,000 tonnes of trees. It has a positive energy balance: 
The energy required to convert trees into cellulose is 
approximately double that required to transform fresh seaweed 
into flour to make paper mixture. 
  "The possible industrial use of this abundant raw material, 
that perishes rapidly and has a modest commercial value, is 
being approached along three lines; the production of biogas, 
animal foodstuffs, and paper. The latter is a winner. After 
the ulva seaweed from the lagoon has been dried, using the 
traditional technique for alfalfa, it is transformed into a 
flour that, blandly pretreated using a process know-how that has 
been perfected by the paper mill, is incorporated in the paper 
mixture in its integral form." The technicians say that the 
material obtained has better characteristics than normal paper 
produced from virgin cellulose; it is 30-43 percent stiffer, 
35-80 percent more tear resistant, and 42-47 percent more energy 
is required to tear it. 
  The testing history of this "sea lettuce" has the flavor of 
the old crafts. It is a rediscovery of the ancestral logic of 
the conservation of the grape and its transformation into 
currants. Nicolucci says that, "If the ulva seaweed flour is not 
very swollen, it behaves as an organic filler when it is put 
into water and improves the biodegradability of the paper. It 
acts as a binder with physical-mechanical characteristics that 
can be compared with those obtained using cationic starch if it 
is made to swell a lot." The production costs, compared with a 
paper of analogous characteristics, have also been notably 
reduced; from the increase of 300 percent for the first 
industrial test in which 700 kilograms of paper were obtained, 
there has been a reduction to 15 percent for 400 tonnes. 
Successive steps to optimize the harvest, the drying, the 
grinding, and the relative treatments have led to estimate costs 
that are five percent lower than the traditional ones. Of the 
24,000 tonnes of paper produced annually by Favini, eight 
percent are already made from seaweed. This already represents 
the utilization of one third of the excess production of the 
lagoon that would not be used otherwise. 
  There are many uses: from waste disposal to writing paper, 
paper for photocopiers, laser printers, and for packing. They 
are already looking at recycling the small amount of residual 
organic and mineral sludge from the production, originating from 
various materials, to make backing-block cardboards. Thanks to 
innovation an environmental problem is becoming a development 
factor, in which Japan has already shown its interest.

<F P=106> [Article by Giuseppe Caravita: "The Sun Inside a Film"] </F>
  [Text] A semitransparent film, a few millimeters thick, is 
stretched over the roof of an automobile. It looks like a 
decorative covering that has been invented by some designer. It 
is really a highly efficient photovoltaic panel that is 40 
percent better than the silicon disc panels in current use. 
  Phos Batteries, a newly-formed company in Milan, will start 
to produce this film on an industrial scale next year. The thin 
lithium-metal based film is sandwiched between two layers of 
polymer (plastic) and is able to convert sunlight into an 
electric current and transfer it to a system of batteries that 
are also based on the same lithium-polymer technology. 
  The result is a clean, low-cost energy system. Above all, it 
will allow for the development of electric-solar vehicles (and 
an infinity of other applications) that are really within the 
reach of the mass consumer market. 
  "We are designing the first productive modules for the thin 
lithium-polymer film," said Federico Foti, researcher and 
founder of Phos, "and we will start production by the end of 
next year, using modular units that can continuously produce 
thin photovoltaic film or film for batteries (in practice it is 
the same) for 1 million Watt-years." Foti already has 
negotiations well underway for the batteries (that are three 
times more efficient than the traditional lead ones) ranging 
from electronics to portable computers and the electric car. 
Contacts are just starting for the application of the thin 
lithium-polymer film to photovoltaic panels, and the major 
European energy producers are also starting to take an interest. 
  "As well as the increased electrical efficiency that is 
intrinsic in photovoltaic energy via thin film," said Foti, 
"there is another great advantage to be taken into 
consideration. The transparent film does not require the 
special bulky and costly supports needed for silicon chip 
panels. In practice it can be stretched over any surface that 
is exposed to the sun, of any shape or curvature, and it is 
easily connected to the battery system using any normal electric 
wire." Therefore it is an innovation that can transform the 
roofs of houses and cars, and even greenhouses and agricultural 
awnings into electrical power plants. The installation costs 
are lower than those for solar energy today. 
  What led up to the discovery of this innovation, that is 
certainly one of the most promising the energy field has seen 
for some years? "Polymer electrolytes that can be used instead 
of the normal chemical electrolytes were developed in the United 
States some time ago," said Foti. "I came across this research 
some years ago when I was working for a group of Italian 
companies to study the best batteries for an electronic device. 
We already had an intuition, at that time, about the potential 
of these patents and we started a work group along these lines. 
The work group managed to develop some thin film prototypes by 
combining solutions that had been worked on in both the United 
States and in Italy (including some fundamental patents for 
polymer cathodes that had come out of Eniricerche), and 
prototype lithium-polymer batteries. Then we started to 
collaborate with an Italian company that specializes in the 
development of machines and production processes in this field, 
and that is now preparing the first production modules for the 
concrete launching of Phos." 
  There is only one other company in the world, the American 
company Valence Technology, that is preparing to compete with 
the Italian company Phos. This company was also set up by 
researchers, and it should start production of lithium-polymer 
batteries in the United States this year "but using a cathodic 
material," says Foti, "that we have tested in the laboratory and 
that has shown itself to be inferior to ours. The result is 
that their batteries will be slightly less powerful than ours 
and with a shorter lifespan than ours." 
  Certainly Valence, sponsored by the powerful American 
electric automobile consortium, has never given any signs in the 
photovoltaic direction, the other large field of application of 
the lithium-polymer film. "While we," adds Foti, "want to start 
field testing immediately and with integrated systems comprising 
a photovoltaic cell and a battery." An example is a solar 
electric car with a flat "superbattery" that is stretched (using 
thin film) over the chassis and under the seats. On the outer 
bodywork, the same film is able to capture solar energy. It is 
an urban electric vehicle that could function throughout the 
summer without ever being recharged, particularly in certain 
areas of Italy, but it would be able to assure the necessary 
autonomy for daily movements. It could be recharged once a week 
in winter using a normal electric socket outlet. This is Foti's 
dream and now it clearly seems to be nearer.

behind the latest environmental measures, Italy still has a long 
way to go before its citizens are happy with the conditions of 
their surroundings, according to the findings of a survey of 
Italians' views on the environment carried out by the National 
Statistics Institute, ISTAT. 
  In its annual report covering the year just past, ISTAT did 
acknowledge that the recent launch of the 1994-96 plan for the 
environment, new laws on water supplies and the setting up of a 
national agency to deal with environmental protection, "steps in 
the right direction" but the findings of the survey suggest that 
the Italian population harbor large doubts about air pollution, 
drinking water, and dirty streets. 
  According to 31 percent of Italians interviewed the air they 
breathe is increasingly unfit, with only 3.5 percent expressing 
satisfaction at the quality of the air where they live. The 
trend shows that those in the North are most afflicted by smog 
and that people are aware that motor vehicle exhaust fumes are 
the main culprits. 
  Similarly, the poor quality of tap water and the shoddy 
service offered by water distribution networks were points that 
38 percent expressed worries about, with many of those 
interviewed up and down the country choosing bottled water to 
drink rather than trusting their local supply. Sicily and 
Sardinia are the worst hit by irregular and undrinkable water 
supplies. 
  Cleaner streets is one of the cries most heard from 
inhabitants of the bigger cities and from regions in the South, 
although at the same time, according to the survey, there is a 
general lack of "necessary awareness" about the problems of the 
rising levels of refuse in Italian streets. In fact only 27 
percent of all interviewees referred to their streets as "too 
dirty." 
  On a wider scale, other figures published by ISTAT show that 
last year was catastrophic for Italy's national forests, 1.5 
percent (104.34 hectares) of which were destroyed by 11,932 
reported forest fires. 
  Italy's beaches do not escape scrutiny either with just over 
half (59.7 percent) of the nation's total coastline vaunting 
offshore waters in which swimming is allowed. People are 
advised to stay away from the seas elsewhere because of 
excessive levels of pollution or the lack of necessary analyses. 
However, in comparison with 1992, ISTAT stressed that this 
represents an actual rise of eight percent in the total quota of 
"swimmable" beaches. 
  Some good news does emerge from the Institute's report 
regarding the numbers of environmental monitoring stations being 
developed throughout Italy that eventually will feed a 
nationwide network of research centers.

<F P=106> [Article by Bart Stam: "Lower Costs or Higher Return Is the </F>
Dilemma for Solar Energy""] 
  [Text] Amsterdam -- While a large European conference on 
photovoltaic solar energy (PV) will take place in Amsterdam next 
week, many countries are wrestling with the question of how to 
proceed from here. More funds for research and development into 
improved solar cells, or a reduction in costs of the present PV 
systems? The Netherlands is betting on both horses. 
Photovoltaic solar energy has the best credentials for becoming 
the most important durable source of energy in the next century. 
In contrast to wind turbines, for instance, there is enough 
space in heavily populated countries to be able to mount solar 
cells on roofs and walls of buildings and houses. This is why 
Japan is attempting to have 70,000 homes fitted with a PV system 
on their roofs by the turn of the century. 
  The choice with which many industrial countries are 
struggling is: should we first improve the yield from solar 
cells, or should we reduce the high costs of the present PV 
systems by improving production? Several years ago, Germany 
chose the second option, but it has not turned out to be a 
useful as originally thought. The ambitious `Thousand Roofs 
Project' has sadly produced very little new knowledge; in fact, 
each time the same information was obtained from 2,250 separate 
projects. 
  Unlike Germany, the Netherlands has not yet made a definite 
choice between the two options. The National Research Program 
into Photovoltaic Solar Energy (NOZ- PV) specifically states 
that both higher cell yields and market development are 
essential in order to make PV competitive in the long run with 
fossil fuels. 
  An important part of the congress in Amsterdam (11-5 April) 
is concerned with the technology. In the short term, it would 
appear that the leading part has been reserved for solar cells 
made from (semi) crystalline silicon. In the Netherlands, R&amp;S 
Renewable Energy Systems and the ECN (the Dutch Energy Research 
Center) are the two most important bodies as far as R&amp;D is 
concerned. 
  After the turn of the century, cheaper thin film solar cells 
made of amorphous silicon and polycrystalline silicon will be 
introduced. The highest priority is without any doubt amorphous 
silicon. Japan is leading the field in this area, but the 
University of Utrecht is also making an important contribution 
to international research and development. At the moment the 
University of Utrecht is researching the so-called tandem cell 
(two cells, one on top of the other), with a return of 9.5 
percent. 
  Completely different from the above-mentioned types is the 
organic solar cell. Thanks to the Agricultural University of 
Wageningen, international skepticism about the possibilities of 
this solar cell has largely disappeared. 
  In the long term, that is to say by the period after 2010, 
solar cells must be so far advanced technologically that they 
can compete with conventional energy sources. Cells with very 
high yields of more than 30 percent are therefore now needed. 
This is where the so-called III/V solar cells come in, where 
Netherlands research is concentrating on germanium substrates. 
  PV applications in consumer electronics are slowly becoming 
more common. The same applies for applications where no 
electricity network is available. For garden houses, 
houseboats, drinking water pumps and light buoys, PV systems are 
becoming economically attractive. 
  PV is still, however, far too expensive for the present 
electricity supply. Yet the United States and Japan in 
particular are working on larger demonstration projects in which 
the accent lies on applications of PV systems in houses and 
buildings. 
  On a smaller scale the Netherlands is also active. Novem 
[Netherlands Association of Energy and the Environment] , ECN, 
and R&amp;S, together with four energy companies, have prepared a 
plan for the slow introduction of PV into the Netherlands energy 
supply. According to the plan, by 1996 a total of 1.3 MW 
[Megawatt] of network-linked systems should be installed on the 
roofs of between 500 and 750 houses. The capacity will rise to 
about 240 MW only between the years 2000 and 2010. The largest 
projects which are being prepared at the moment will take place 
in Amsterdam (66 houses) and Amersfoot (400 houses).

"Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations"] 
  [Text] Robert Atkins, Minister of State for the Environment 
and Countryside, today announced a new set of Regulations to 
tighten controls of transfrontier shipments of waste. 
  The Regulations were laid before Parliament on Monday and 
will come into force on 6 May 1994. They supplement the 
provisions of the EC [European Commission] Waste Shipments 
Regulation, which comes into operation on the same date. 
  In a written reply to a Parliamentary Question from Nigel 
Waterson MP [Member of Parliament] (Eastbourne), Mr. Atkins said: 
  "The Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 1994, laid 
before Parliament on Monday, will come into force on 6 May when 
Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93 on the supervision and 
control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the 
European Community (the "Waste Shipments Regulation") applies. 
The Waste Shipments Regulation implements the obligations of 
the Basel Convention which, together with the EC, the United 
Kingdom ratified on 7 February and to which it will become a 
Party on 8 May. The EC Regulation is directly applicable, but 
additional domestic legislation is required to give full effect 
to some of its provisions. For the UK, this additional 
legislation is contained in the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste 
Regulations 1994. 
  "The Regulations designate Waste Regulations Authorities in 
Great Britain and District Councils in Northern Ireland as the 
competent authorities of dispatch and destination, for imports 
and exports to and from the UK, and designate the Secretary of 
State as competent authority for transit shipments, and as 
`correspondent' for the purposes of the EC Regulation. Other 
provisions include conferring powers on customs officers to 
assist competent authorities in carrying out their functions by 
detaining shipments where appropriate; and specifying offences 
and penalties relating to compliance with the Regulation. The 
Regulations also provide for the preparation of a waste 
management plan (in accordance with the Waste Framework 
Directive). 
  "Public consultations were carried out in March on a draft 
of 
the Regulations and of accompanying guidance. The Regulations 
have been modified to reflect the concerns and interests of 
industry, local authorities and the public in response to those 
consultations. The Government is satisfied that these 
Regulations will enable the UK to fulfil its obligations under 
the Basel Convention, and contribute significantly towards 
securing the environmentally sound management of waste movements 
to and from the UK." 
<H5>  Notes to Editors </H5>
  The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Basel 
Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of 
Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal provides a framework for 
states to control movements of hazardous waste. Parties to the 
Convention may ban imports of waste, and shipments are not 
allowed between Parties and non-Parties without specific 
(bi-lateral or multi-lateral) agreements. Where shipments do 
occur, the Convention provides for a global system of 
environmental controls in which the onus is on the exporting 
state to ensure environmentally sound management of the wastes. 
  The UK, together with the EC, ratified the Basel Convention 
on 7 February, and will become Parties to the Convention on 8 
May. The EC Waste Shipments Regulation (259/93), which 
implements the obligations of the Basel Convention in the 
Community, will apply on 6 May. 
  The new Regulation, which supersedes the existing EC 
Directive 84/631/EEC, as amended (implemented in the UK by the 
Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 1988), will enable 
the UK to exercise strict controls over imports and exports of 
waste. The EC Regulation is directly applicable, and therefore 
does not require transposition into national legislation, but 
some additional domestic legislation is required to give full 
effect to some of its provisions. These matters are covered in 
the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 1994.The main 
provisions of the new Regulations are: 
  --designation of competent authorities and "correspondent"; 
  --discretionary powers for competent authorities of dispatch 
to require notifications of shipments of waste from their area 
to be routed through them; 
  --enforcement powers for competent authorities to ensure, 
where appropriate, the return of waste to the UK, or to secure 
the environmentally sound disposal or recovery of waste; 
  --to require a certificate relating to financial guarantees 
to be obtained prior to shipments into and out of the UK; 
  --powers for customs officers to detain shipments in order 
to 
assist competent authorities in carrying out their functions; 
  --provision for the preparation of a waste management plan 
(in accordance with the Waste Framework Directive); 
  --offences and penalties; 
  --powers for the Secretary of State to request information; 
and 
  --various transitional provisions and revocations of 
superseded legislation.

<F P=106> [Article by Sean Ryan, environment correspondent: "Diesel </F>
`Kills 3,000 a Year'"] 
  [Text] The government's most senior adviser on air 
pollution in cities will trigger an intense debate over the 
safety of diesel vehicles tomorrow by claiming that their 
exhausts kill 3,000 people a year, writes Sean Ryan, Environment 
Correspondent. 
  Professor Roy Harrison, chairman of a panel of experts 
advising ministers on urban air quality, will warn that minute 
particles given off when diesel fuel is burned may be causing 
heart and lung failure, strokes and cancer. 
  Harrison accused diesel manufacturers yesterday of "peddling 
misinformation" about their vehicles, which have soared in 
popularity after being marketed as environmentally friendly. 
More than 340,000 diesel cars were sold last year. 
  "Anyone who is concerned about air quality should not buy 
diesel cars," said Harrison. 
  His claims were condemned by motor industry executives as 
"scientifically dangerous". But Harrison believes he has 
evidence to justify tighter exhaust standards and tax changes to 
discourage diesel sales. 
  Harrison, professor of environmental health at Birmingham 
University, calculated an annual death toll following American 
research into the dangers of PM 10s -- "particulate matter" 10 
thousandths of a millimetre in diameter. Diesel vehicles are 
thought to produce one-third of the particles circulating in 
cities, and their exhaust is classified as a probable carcinogen. 
  A study published by the NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE 
analysed the deaths of 8,111 adults in six American cities and 
found "statistically significant and robust" associations with 
air pollution. The report concluded that the death rate in the 
most polluted city was 26 percent higher than in the least 
polluted. The strongest link was PM 10s. 
  Harrison's concerns are shared by medical experts at the 
Department of the Environment, whose ministers are becoming 
increasingly critical of cars in cities. The government is 
expected to announce cuts of &pound;1 billion in Britain's 
road-building programme this week. 
  But motor manufacturers claimed Harrison's calculations were 
misleading. Lucas, Britain's sole manufacturer of diesel 
injection systems, said that while diesel exhaust probably 
caused cancer, the risk was "vanishingly small". 
  The makers of diesel cars say they are less damaging to the 
environment than petrol models because they emit lower levels of 
several polluting gases and contain less benzene, a known 
carcinogen linked with leukaemia. 
  Harrison, who disputes most of the manufacturers' claims, 
says any technological improvements could be cancelled out by 
higher sales of diesel cars.

<F P=106> [Article by Paul Brown: "Diesel `Poses Threat" to Health"] </F>
  [Text] The Government has been formally warned by its 
health and environment advisers to halt the rise in diesel fumes. 
  Increasing sales--more than one in four cars are now 
diesel--point to the likelihood of taxation being used to cut 
demand. 
  The Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants told 
the Government to arrest or reverse the rising trend in diesel 
because of evidence linking it to asthma, cancer and other 
diseases. 
  In January, a report highlighted international evidence that 
diesel can cause health problems. 
  But one of the problems for scientists is that other fumes, 
especially those from petrol engines, are also implicated in 
health studies. 
  Professor Anthony Newman Taylor, from the Brompton Hospital 
in London, said the rise in road traffic had coincided with a 
rise in asthma. But this did not mean the two were related, he 
added. 
  A third issue being researched is the issue of pollution in 
the home. Oxides of nitrogen from unventilated gas cookers are 
far higher inside homes than outside and researchers are 
investigating to see whether this has any effect on health. 
  The Government is collating all its research in the Medical 
Research Council's Institute for Environment and Health, based 
at the University of Leicester. 
  Yesterday scientists from the departments of health and 
environment said urgent work was required on possible links 
between air pollution and increasing respiratory illness. About 
2,000 people a year die as a result of asthma.

  [Text] Ministers have been warned that they risk bringing 
300 years' worth of stored-up pollution flooding into rural 
rivers if coal privatisation goes ahead without legal safeguards. 
  Environment experts have called for a new law forbidding the 
owners of disused mines from polluting the water supply. 
  The water pumps are never switched off in Britain's former 
coalfields because, if they were, water would flood the tunnels, 
turning rivers orange, killing the fish and poisoning local 
residents. 
  The dangers are at their worst in Durham and South Wales, 
already hard hit by the post-1992 wave of pit closures. Dr Paul 
Younger, lecturer in water studies at Newcastle University, 
says: "There are nine pumping stations in the Wear Valley, 
Durham, which cost British Coal &pound;1m a year. 
  "If they were switched off, 100 million litres of acid water 
a day would be discharged into Durham's rivers. 
  "Iron's the main problem. Any microbes living off the bed of 
the river would die, and about 20 to 25 per cent of the water 
supply of Sunderland is in the line of fire." 
  Mine owners are exempt from a 1991 law which makes it 
illegal 
to pollute rivers. So far, the Government has only promised that 
the new Coal Authority will have to give a fortnight's notice 
before switching off the pumps. 
  Sunderland MP Chris Mullin says: "The problem is that nobody 
wants to accept responsibility. The buck keeps moving around in 
ever faster circles."

`Exploiting Toxic Loophole'"] 
  [Text] The Government is exploiting a loophole in the Basel 
Convention, which controls the international trade in toxic 
waste, to get rid of unwanted substances in the third world, 
opposition parties alleged yesterday. 
  Chris Smith and Simon Hughes, environment spokesmen for 
Labour and the Liberal Democrats, said the loophole consists of 
describing waste exports to developing countries as substances 
intended for recycling or as foreign aid in the form of 
recoverable materials. 
  They said much of the waste was simply dumped, and called 
for 
the loophole to be closed. 
  In 1993 Britain exported 105,000 tonnes of waste, half of it 
to South-east Asia, three times more than three years ago. 
According to Customs records, 65 countries outside the developed 
world's Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
received waste from Britain last year. 
  On March 31 the countries which have signed the Basel 
Convention, which includes all the members of the European 
Union, will meet to discuss controls on the toxic waste trade. 
Denmark has proposed a ban on all exports of waste from the 25 
OECD nations to non-OECD countries, whether described as for 
recycling or otherwise. 
  Greenpeace, in a letter to John Gummer, the Environment 
Secretary, said this call was supported by more than 100 
developing countries and at least 12 industrialised countries, 
but opposed by Britain. Six other countries, including the 
United States, Germany and Japan, want the loophole to remain 
open. These are the countries that export most waste. 
  At Mr Gummer's request, Greenpeace has sent files in which 
the damage done by British toxic waste exports is catalogued. 
  Greenpeace said in its letter: "Our report on the export of 
lead battery waste shows very high levels of contamination in 
the Philippines and Indonesia, where British waste has been 
exported. These recycling operations cannot be considered 
environmentally sound." 
  Mr Smith said the Government should sign up for the ban. 
"Exporting toxic waste to the developing world amounts to 
dumping our environmental problems in someone else's back yard. 
It is immoral -- promoting profits for multinational companies 
at the expense of human health. It is ecological 
irresponsibility. And it is economic nonsense, costing jobs in 
the UK."

<F P=106> [Article by Paul Brown, environment correspondent: "Pit </F>
Closures Fuel Optimism Over Cuts in Acid Rain"] 
  [Text] The closure of pits and coal-fired power stations 
will dramatically reduce the effects of acid rain on the United 
Kingdom, although more than half the country still suffers its 
effects, government scientists said yesterday. 
  Its cost in damage to buildings, crops and trees is hard to 
calculate, but they believe curbing it will save between &pound;1 
billion and &pound;2.3 billion. 
  Pending European agreements will cut British sulphur 
emissions by 80 per cent by 2010, stopping further damage in all 
but 5 per cent of the country and allowing lakes, rivers, trees 
and heather to start recovering. 
  Scientists have been studying "critical loads" -- the point 
at which acid rain begins to kill or injure plants, animals, and 
fish. But damage to buildings is also severe and some ancient 
cathedrals have been irreparably eroded. In chalky areas, where 
the acid is neutralised as it falls, there is virtually no 
effect on soils. In areas of granite, peat or sand where there 
is natural acidity, the extra acid falling as rain kills fish 
and plants and damages trees. 
  The Government has already overseen a 30 per cent reduction 
in sulphur dioxide emissions from the 1980 level. Last week 
officials agreed to take this to 50 per cent by 2000, 70 per 
cent by 2005, and 80 per cent by 2010. Ministers are expected to 
agree the new protocol in the next few days. 
  Although the targets appear drastic, the Government is 
likely 
to achieve them by closing the coal mines and switching from 
coal to gas-fired power generation. Gas does not produce the 
sulphur for acid rain. 
  Maps produced by scientists show that 121,000 square 
kilometres of the UK is being damaged by acid rain out of a 
total of 250,000 square kilometres. This will be reduced to 
14,000 square kilometres if the targets are met. 
  Even so, the ceasing of acid rain does not guarantee the 
reversal of the process of damage. In some areas it may be 20 
years or more before the biological life begins to recover, and 
in many the soil structure has changed so much that the plant 
and fish life which recolonises will be different from the 
original.

<F P=106> [Michael Hornsby article: "Water Tests Show Quality </F>
Improving"] 
  [Text] Water quality in Britain's rivers has improved over 
the past 20 years, a survey shows. 
  Over three years, 170,000 schoolchildren tested 415 rivers 
and streams: 75 per cent were in "great" or "good" condition, 
based on ability to support insect life. Jane De'Ath, who 
co-ordinated the National RiverWATCH project, said that was a 
5.7 per cent improvement since 1971. 
  "This is a welcome improvement but we cannot afford to be 
complacent," she said. "There were big regional variations, 
with rivers in the North generally faring much better, while 
water quality in some southeastern counties has declined." 
  The children monitored their local rivers during September, 
October and November in 1991, 1992 and last year. They were 
given kits to measure acid and nitrate levels and fashioned 
other equipment from household rubbish. Water quality was rated 
"great" in 28.2 per cent of rivers, meaning they were able to 
support insects that need high oxygen levels, and 47.2 per cent 
of rivers rated "good". The worst 2.9 per cent supported no 
animal life. 
  There were big regional variations. On the insect test, 
quality improved most in Warwickshire and Lancashire and 
declined most in Bedfordshire, Suffolk and London. The poor 
showing of the South East is due to concentration of industry 
and population, intensive farming and drought. 
  The 13 most litter-strewn rivers were the Cottingham Beck 
(Humberside), Stour (Worcs), Idle (S Yorks), Lukely Brook (loW), 
Severn and Rea (Shrops), Lostock, Irwell and Calder (Lancs), 
Trent (Staffs), Aire (W Yorks), North Esk (Midlothian) and Cam.

<F P=106> [Article by Charles Clover, environment editor: "Most People </F>
Are Now Exposed to Ozone Pollution"] 
  [Text] On sunny days most people in England and Wales are 
exposed to unsafe levels of low-level ozone pollution, an 
independent study for the Department of the Environment said 
yesterday. 
  Low-level ozone -- caused by sunlight acting on nitrogen 
oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by cars and, to a 
far lesser extent, industry -- has doubled in Britain this 
century, the report shows. 
  High concentrations of ozone have been shown to damage the 
lungs in people who take heavy exercise. Ten per cent of the 
population are extra sensitive to ozone, and in them the 
pollution may trigger respiratory diseases. 
  Scientists say that ozone at these levels is likely to cause 
billions of pounds of damage to paint and building materials, 
disease in trees and plants and crop damage of more than 
&pound;34 
million a year. 
  The report, which shows that peak levels of ozone pollution 
reach the same levels in the south of England as in smog-ridden 
Los Angeles, will inevitably add to pressure for tougher curbs 
on car emissions. 
  Prof David Fowler of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology's 
laboratory near Edinburgh said that ozone pollution -- half of 
which is drawn in from the Continent -- was "a European problem." 
  The first maps of ozone exposure to be compiled by the 
Photochemicals Oxidants Review Group show that parts of England 
and Wales are exposed to harmful levels of ozone for up to 800 
hours each year. Levels of exposure either exceed or are very 
close to safe limits, thought to be 60 parts per billion for 
humans and 40 parts per billion for plants and crops. 
  The study also shows that levels of nitrogen oxides, 
produced 
by cars and power stations, are now double the level of sulphur 
pollution in Britain. Britain exports 75 per cent of its 
nitrogen oxides to the Continent. 
  Professor Fowler said that present reductions in pollution 
from cars expected as a result of new standards for cars in 1996 
"will not be sufficient" to improve air quality after the year 
2,000.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Department of Trade and </F>
Industry: "Terms of Reference for Nuclear Review Announced"] 
  [Text] The terms of reference, timing and format of the 
nuclear review were announced today by Tim Eggar, minister for 
Energy. 
  The review will focus on the future prospects for nuclear 
power including, without commitment, its privatisation. It will 
also examine the economic and commercial viability of new 
nuclear power stations in the UK. 
  In a written answer to a parliamentary question from Mr. Tim 
Yeo MP (South Suffolk) Mr. Eggar said: 
  "I am now in a position to announce the terms of reference, 
timing and format of the nuclear review. This answer has been 
agreed with my Rt Hon [Right Honorable] friend the secretary of 
state for Scotland, who has responsibility for the nuclear power 
generating industry in Scotland. 
  "The government believes that the future role of nuclear 
power in the UK's electricity supply will depend on it proving 
itself competitive while maintaining rigorous standards of 
safety and environmental protection. 
  "The Coal Review established that there is a sound economic 
basis for continuing to operate existing nuclear stations. The 
nuclear review will not consider whether Sizewell B should be 
brought on stream. Sizewell B is on course to start operating 
this year, subject to the receipt by Nuclear Electric of such 
consents as are required by law. 
  "Decisions on these consents are matters for the appropriate 
ministers and authorities and are not matters for the review. 
The review will, however, take into account the decisions made 
on Sizewell B, whether the consents are granted or refused. 
  "The nuclear review will focus on the future prospects for 
nuclear power. It will examine the economic and commercial 
viability of new nuclear stations in the UK, against the 
background of the government's energy policy as set out in the 
White Paper "The Prospects of Coal" (Cm 2235). 
  "The government has asked the nuclear generating industry to 
make the commercial case for new nuclear generating capacity and 
to make that case publicly available. Whether any new nuclear 
station could be built with private sector finance will be a key 
test of that case. The government would welcome comments on the 
industry's case, which will be published shortly. 
  "The government also invites submissions from interested 
parties on whether new nuclear power stations offer particular 
diversity, security of supply and environmental benefits or 
disadvantages. 
  "The review will examine possible options for introducing 
private sector finance into the nuclear industry. As part of 
this, the government is prepared to consider without commitment 
representations on whether privatisation would in principle be 
feasible, and what a practical timescale might be. The review 
will address the question of how best to manage the substantial 
nuclear waste and decommissioning liabilities which are 
currently the responsibility of the public sector, so as to 
secure value for money for the taxpayer while ensuring necessary 
safety and environmental standards are met. 
  "The review will also assess the existing arrangements to 
enable the full costs of nuclear power in the UK to be met, 
taking account of the Trade and Industry Committee's 
recommendations on the fossil fuel levy in their report "British 
Energy Policy and the Market for Coal" (HC236). 
  "Submissions on these issues should be made in writing both 
to my Department and the Scottish Office, to be received by 30 
September. All substantive submissions received by the 
government will be made publicly available. Copies will be 
placed in the libraries of this House and of the House of Lords. 
Commercially confidential information in submissions received 
by the government, internal papers and advice and reports 
internal to government, and advice from external advisers, will 
not be made publicly available in this way. 
  "The review will be undertaken by the Department of Trade 
and 
Industry and the Scottish Office Industry Department, in 
consultation with other government departments as appropriate. 
The government may appoint consultants to advise it on matters 
relevant to the review as the need arises. 
  "My Rt Hon Friend the secretary of state for the environment 
is announcing today a separate review of radioactive waste 
management policy, to be conducted in parallel with the nuclear 
review."

<F P=106> [Press release from the UK Department of the Environment: </F>
"Air Quality Standard for Ozone Recommended"] 
  [Text] An air quality standard has been recommended for 
ozone in the United Kingdom, and the results of ozone monitoring 
in the UK are to be made available to the public on an hourly 
basis. 
  The recommendation has been made by the government's 
Independent Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS), 
chaired by Professor Anthony Seaton of the University of 
Aberdeen Medical School, and is one in a series of standards 
being recommended for pollutants. 
  The panel assessed available health and air quality data for 
ozone and have recommended that the standard should be 50 parts 
per billion as a running eight-hour average. 
  In their report the panel state that: "This recommendation 
is 
intended to reduce the exposure of the population, including 
individuals who may be particularly sensitive to ozone, to 
levels at which harmful effects are unlikely to occur. We 
recommend that techniques for monitoring the standard are 
consistent with those of the Department of the Environment's 
national ozone monitoring networks. 
  "We recognise that this is an ambitious standard which will 
need international action to be achieved. In order to monitor 
progress we recommend that ozone monitoring data in the UK are 
reported in terms of the number of days the standard is exceeded 
at any one site per year. We note from past evidence that if 
the 50 ppb [parts per billion] 8-hour running average is 
exceeded on less than 10 days per year, at any one site, then 
the maximum 8-hour concentration at that site is unlikely to 
exceed 100 ppb, a concentration at which health effects in 
healthy individuals have been clearly demonstrated." 
  Commenting on the panel's recommendation, Robert Atkins, 
minister of Environment and Countryside said: "I am grateful for 
the panel's report, which the government will consider 
carefully, particularly in the context of the Framework for Air 
Quality Standards outlined in the discussion paper "Improving 
Air Quality," which I recently published. My Department will be 
consulting with industry, environmental groups, and other bodies 
on the standard. 
  "The Government recognises the need to take action to halt 
the rise in ozone levels described in the recent report of the 
Photochemical Oxidants Review Group (PORG). As ozone is an 
international problem, this will require cooperation with our 
neighbours in Europe. Meanwhile we already have policies in 
hand to reduce emissions of the precursor pollutants which form 
ozone: 
  -- all new petrol cars are catalyst equipped 
  -- a strategy was published last year for reducing by 30 
percent emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCS), one of 
the two precursors of ground level ozone by 1999 on a 1988 basis 
  -- discussions are beginning within the UNECE [United 
Nations' Economic Commission for Europe] on a revision to the 
Nox Protocol (the other main precursor) which was signed in 1988 
and which freezes emissions in 1994 at the 1987 level. The UK 
is on course to achieve this target and the Government welcomes 
international discussions on the opportunities to make further 
reductions." 
  Mr Atkins added: "I am pleased to announce that my 
department 
will be upgrading its air quality bulletin service to provide 
hourly information on ozone to the public via CEEFAX, TELETEXT 
and Freephone by the summer." 
<H5>  Notes to Editors </H5>
  The Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS) was 
established following the government's commitment in the 1990 
White Paper "This Common Inheritance" to set up a panel to 
recommend air quality standards for the UK. It is chaired by 
Professor Anthony Seaton, Head of Environmental &amp; 
Occupational 
Medicine at the Aberdeen University Medical School and members 
include medical and air pollution experts. 
  The report is the second in a series which will make 
recommendations for other pollutants suggested to the panel by 
the government. Recommendations on carbon monoxide, 1,3 
butadiene, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and particulates 
are expected in due course.

  [Text] Airborne pollution from pig farms and other 
intensive agriculture sites is damaging British forests. 
  Scientists have linked ammonia emissions from livestock with 
acidification of forest soils, which causes parts of trees to 
wither and die. 
  The research, carried out by the Institute of Terrestrial 
Ecology's Merlewood Research Station at Grange-over-Sands, 
Cumbria, has drawn attention to a source of pollution that up to 
now has been all but ignored in Britain. 
  Since 1950 there has been a 50 per cent growth in emissions 
of ammonia over Europe and in some countries it may have doubled. 
  Agriculture is believed to account for 95 per cent of these 
emissions and the new research indicates that large tracts of 
British woodland may be suffering as a result. 
  The study, carried out by Dr Phil Ineson with funding from 
the Department of the Environment, concentrated on Scots pine 
and Norway spruce woods near a pig farm at Wensleydale in the 
Yorkshire Dales. 
  Dr Ineson, writing in the Natural Environment Research 
Council's Nerc News, said measurements showed high 
levels of ammonia-linked pollution downwind of the farm and less 
upwind. Concentrations were highest during muck spreading and 
when pigs were moved on to the farm in the winter and spring.

<F P=106> [Article by Paul Brown: "Environment `Failures' Condemned"] </F>
  [Text] The Government's annual audit on the state of the 
environment was condemned yesterday by opposition parties and 
pressure groups for its broken promises and lack of progress. 
  However, John Gummer, the Environment Secretary, claimed 
that 
many targets had been met and more had been set. He believed 
that environmental standards and the Government's move to 
deregulate many activities in order to increase competitiveness 
were compatible. 
  He listed his achievements as the ratification of the 
Convention on Climate Change, which seeks to combat global 
warming, extending pollution control to eight new industry 
groups, including minerals and chemicals; strengthening the 
Energy Efficiency Office; and setting reduction targets for 
sulphur dioxide emissions to cut acid rain. 
  The report, issued eight months late, is the third 
audit--begun with the 1990 white paper, This Common 
Inheritance--and details the original promises made and action 
taken since. 
  Chris Smith, shadow environment protection spokesman, said 
the document displayed inaction and complacency. He said the 
last three months had seen the Government deliberately destroy 
the Energy Conservation Bill, conduct a review of the roads 
programme that left almost all of it in place, and the 
privatisation of British Rail. 
  Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat spokesman, pointed out 
that the Government had abandoned contaminated land registers 
and showed lack of long-term commitment to cut carbon emissions. 
"The report is as much a catalogue of government environment 
inaction as of action." 
  The 200-page document lists 652 promises although some of 
the 
main ones show little progress. They include: 
  --In previous years there were plans to bring forward new 
air 
quality targets by 1993. A discussion paper was issued this year 
but there are no targets. 
  --Minimum construction standards were to be set in 1992 for 
chemical and oil stores. This has been abandoned. 
  --Banning lead solder in water pipes, promised in 1992, is 
still under consideration. Many parts of Britain have lead 
levels in water well above World Health Organisation guidelines. 
  Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, 
said: "This whole document is a testament to deregulatory acts 
and puts back the cause of the environment. It is proof that 
ideological blinkers do not deliver environmental protection." 

  -  Farmers are causing damage to Britain's prime nature 
conservation sites, despite being paid &pound;7 million a year to 
protect them, according to a report by the National Audit Office 
published today. 

  A survey found that nearly one in five sites of special 
scientific interest showed damage or deterioration between 
annual visits. During spot checks in one area, the North-west, 
six out of 10 sites had been damaged by inappropriate farming 
practices. 
  The report also criticises English Nature, the quango 
charged 
with identifying and protecting the sites, for failure to 
encourage and assist public access to national nature reserves.

<F P=106> [Article by John Vidal: "Crust of a Wave"] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Little changes: this week John 
Gummer, environment secretary, launched the third annual report 
on UK environmental progress. It stated blandly that 80 per cent 
of British beaches now met mandatory EU [expansion not given] 
standards: what was not mentioned is that no tests are done even 
for viruses or many minor ailments caused by polluted sea water 
and that 20 per cent of British beaches, even after 18 years' 
legislation, still fail to meet minimum safety and legal 
standards. 
  The official line is relentlessly cheery. The Water Services 
Association, which represents the water companies, this week 
claimed, in a letter to THE GUARDIAN, that 132 of our beaches 
were (to paraphrase) great and the public really needn't worry 
about bathing water quality after "billions of pounds 
investment" had been made in sewage treatment over the past few 
years." 
  The tourist industry, too, claims all is well: The EU "Blue 
Flag" flutters over 20 British beaches (a small improvement on 
the last years, more than 100 have now won UK government 
"Seaside awards" (26 more than 1992), and 56 have "premier 
awards." On Wednesday the National Rivers Authority calmed the 
waters, too, stating that there had been a 0.6 per cent 
improvement in bathing waters in the last year and the public 
could expect to see "dramatic improvements" after 1995. 
  [Passage omitted] 
  The situation is worst at many of the resorts promoted by 
the 
British tourist board, says Cait Loretto of the Marine 
Conservation Society, which last month published its annual 
guide and found huge problems on the coast. There was no real 
sign of improvement, she says, and the Government runs the risk 
that Britain will be prosecuted for failing to meet its 
18-year-old obligations. Last year, of 80 beaches at 40 resorts, 
24 failed EU minimum standards (compared to 19 the previous 
year). The list of failures is a roll-call of Britain's resorts: 
Scarborough, Skegness, Brighton, Lyme Regis, Weston-super-Mare, 
Hastings, Cleethorpes, Southport, Colwyn Bay, Ayr and, of 
course, Blackpool. 
  The report found many east coast English beaches (the 
Scottish coastline was praised) marred by litter and raw or 
partially treated sewage. It echoed the massive 1193 Norwich 
Union Coastwatch survey. Here 6,000 volunteers found 350,000 
items of beach litter in less than two weeks, increased sewage 
pollution and triple the amount of sanitary and medical waste 
compared to 1992. Almost one quarter of the coast had 
sewage-related debris. "An increasing amount of the coast is 
"soiled by sewage, despite public statements to the contrary," 
says Dr Gareth Rees, head of the department of environment 
management at Farnborough College of Technology who compiled it. 
  "The coast is disgusting," says Loretto. "More people are 
turning to holidays at home. The family holiday shouldn't 
include vomiting." 
  Sewage, neither Mrs Jones nor her companion appreciated, is 
not just human wastes but industrial and trade effluents, engine 
oils, litter, storm water from road surfaces, a range of heavy 
metal contaminants (including mercury, lead, cadmium and 
copper), fat balls from commercial kitchens, cleaning agents, 
and viruses. 
  [Passage omitted] 
  The EU Bathing Directive requires, as a minimum, that 
bathing 
water samples must not exceed 10,000 coliform bacteria per 100 
ml more than once in 20 samples taken over a year. But the EU 
has a "guideline" standard which is 20 times as tough. Only 20 
British beaches meet this. 
  Chris Hines of Surfers Against Sewage, a group frequently 
accused by the authorities of being alarmist, says the tests are 
out of line with current scientific knowledge and technical 
progress and do not mean anything, especially to bathers and the 
people who regularly use British waters: "They are based on sod 
all. They are snapshots," he says. Water off Britain's 419 
designated beaches, he says, is tested once every two weeks in 
the five summer months. A sample is taken 30 cm below the 
surface at one metre depth: 
  "The turds could be two inches to the left and no one would 
be the wiser. What's more the public does not get to see the 
results for two more weeks, so no one has a clue if it's safe to 
bathe. Hepatitis A can remain infectious for up to 100 days in 
sea water. Other viruses can remain live up to six months." 
  The tests, moreover, are only for coliforms which can die 
off 
in saltwater in a few hours. "An absence of coliforms is no 
indication of an absence of human pathogens," says Hines. "Many 
beaches are given a pass and yet are washed with a slick of 
human sewage every day. Many people get ill from bathing on 
so-called passed beaches." 
  The tests look for only two criteria out of 19 possibles 
which could affect human health and water quality. Not included 
are viruses, salmonella, entero-viruses, acidity, minerals, 
pesticides and heavy metals. Faecal steptococci, common and 
potentially lethal, are ignored. 
  "Coliforms have a very rapid die-off period," says Hines. 
"The chances of finding them are not high." Besides, he adds, 
sea water can go from appalling to good very quickly. "In a 
light SW wind, Newquay's town beaches are gross. But high 
pressure and a different wind and everything goes out to sea." 
  The Health Effects of Sea Bathing report by the Government's 
Water Research Council, released in January, was hailed as 
"reassuring" by Robert Aitken, minister of the environment. It 
found that, irrespective of water quality, bathers got a variety 
of minor ailments. Ear, nose, throat and respiratory problems, 
it said, were caused by sea water "upsetting the body's normal 
balance," but increases in diarrhoea and other gastric problems, 
not unsurprisingly, were directly related to the amount of 
bacteria in the water. 
  While dismissing the benefits of tightening EU standards as 
"insignificant," it recommended that sampling should reflect the 
depths of water, locations and tidal states "most used in 
marine recreation." 
  [Passage omitted] 
  The water companies, metaphorically, are in deep, dirty 
water. They have a tendency to blame shipping for pollution but 
the weight of evidence has forced them on the defensive. They 
are committed to &pound;2 billion of improvements. 
  [Passage omitted] 
  British waters are politically, socially, economically and 
scientifically muddy. Water bills are rising and people are 
complaining. Europe is baying and the public is dismayed with 
endless prevarication. Yet Britain's coastline and waters are 
being used more than ever. The privatised companies are being 
forced to address the neglect of 100 years but people are now 
making vast sums on the back of a monopoly. 
  One person, at least, is happy: when North West Water was 
privatised in 1989, Mary Jones bought a few shares for her 
granddaughter. "She's done very well from them," she says, 
staring out into the Blackpool soup. "Hasn't she dear?"

<F P=106> [Article by Robert Tyerman: "Pollution Threatens Insurers"] </F>
  [Text] Surfers Against Sewage may seem a less awesome lobby 
group than Friends of the Earth or Greenpeace. But a &pound;5,000 
damages claim launched by SAS [Surfers Against Sewage] against 
Southern Water is expected to provide a test case which could 
decide whether British companies must expect to face pollution 
bills running into many billions of pounds. 
  Surfer James Andrews claims he caught Hepatitis A from the 
sea 700 metres offshore from Eastbourne after contamination from 
sewage emissions from Southern Water. The water company says 
there are no recorded instances of the disease being contracted 
from sea water and argues there is no evidence in the United 
Kingdom to link Hepatitis A with bathing or surfing. 
  The importance of the case lies in its implications for the 
liabilities that industrial companies and insurers face over 
pollution dating back many years. Southern Water believes that 
at least 60 other potential cases hang on the result of the SAS 
claim. 
  Pollution has become a nightmare for many companies in 
chemical, oil and extractive industries and a big threat to the 
worldwide insurance industry. 
  After lobbying by Stephen Merrett, Lloyd's of London's 
former 
deputy chairman, a Bill is before the United States Congress 
designed to alleviate the crisis, but potential liabilities are 
still huge. 
  Water contamination is the latest in a flood of pollution 
claims that are scaring companies and politicians on both sides 
of the Atlantic. United States insurance ratings agency A M Best 
says potential U.S. environmental and asbestosis claims--many 
insured or reinsured by British companies or Lloyd's 
syndicates--could top &pound;1,300 billion. 
  Best says that already identifiable claims could top 
&pound;88 
billion over the next 25 years. That is nearly three-quarters of 
the insurance industry's capital. 
  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified 
36,000 hazardous waste sites in need of a clean-up, at an 
average cost of &pound;20 million per site. The Confederation of 
British Industry has put the cost of cleaning up contaminated 
British sites at &pound;20 billion. 
  The American situation is bedevilled by the legal concept of 
"no-fault" liability: the principle that the polluter--or the 
polluter's insurer--must pay, whether or not the pollution could 
have been foreseen. 
  Recent British court judgments, notably in a case between 
Cambridge Water and Eastern Counties Leather, have upheld the 
principle of forseeability, but that is scant comfort to 
insurers providing cover worldwide. 
  The latest twist is a spate of lawsuits against garages with 
leaking underground storage tanks which have contaminated water 
supplies. 
  "One site in three in Britain has some degree of 
contamination," says Dave Stewart, a Shell spokesman. 
  BP [British Petroleum] says it will cost "several billions" 
to put things right. The oil majors are now fitting polyethylene 
and fibreglass pipes, instead of metal ones, and using 
continuous tubing to reduce leaks. 
  But most garages are run by independent operators so the 
process of upgrading and installing adequate leakage checks will 
take time. There have been only a few insurance settlements for 
leaks but the claims momentum is picking up. 
  Sun Alliance says another uncertainty in Europe is a 
European 
Commission pollution directive expected this year. Pessimists 
fear companies could be made liable for long-term seepage and 
other contamination which arguably could not have been foreseen. 
  Insurers have taken fright. They may be saddled with 
historic 
claims under old, liberally-worded policies written years before 
pollution became a political issue, but they are writing more 
restrictive policies now. 
  Lloyd's underwriter Richard Keeling says industrial 
companies 
have often been less than frank with insurers about known, but 
not admitted, pollution. 
  He says: "When the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] 
visited one polluter whose works were next to a lake, they asked 
a local why there was a boat out on it. `Every time you come', 
he replied, `they have to send it out to collect the dead 
ducks'." 
  Sun Alliance says: "From now on, we will insure the future, 
but not the past." Insurers will no longer offer retrospective 
liability cover and they are taking a tougher line with clients 
suspected of ignoring obligations under today's environmental 
laws. 
  "We will write sudden and accidental pollution risks but not 
long-term seepage," says one group. "Insurers are devising 
new--and costlier--products for clients to cope with today's 
problems, but gradual contamination is virtually uninsurable at 
present." 
  Amid the gloom, there are signs that Stephen Merrett's call 
for changes in the U.S. market is being heard. A Bill backed by 
the Administration aims to impose a 0.2 per cent levy on 
casualty premiums to finance a "Superfund" to meet environmental 
claims. 
  Polluting companies would take their insurance policies to 
the fund and it would make a non-negotiable offer. If the 
polluter does not like it, he would have to bear the entire cost 
himself. 
  Hank Greenberg, chairman of U.S. insurer AIG [expansion not 
given], has been demanding a levy for years. But he is 
understood to feel that the present Bill does not cast its net 
wide enough. 
  "Morally, we should not be paying for much of this," says 
Keeling, who feels the Bill is a sign of an overdue sea change. 
"Polluters, insurers, Greens and politicians have at last 
decided that the present situation only benefits the lawyers." 
He hopes that this time it will not be the lawyers who have the 
last laugh.

  [Text] Tough restrictions on farmers were announced 
yesterday by the Government to cut down on pollution from 
nitrates which threatens rivers and wildlife. 
  The environment and agriculture departments unveiled 72 
Vulnerable Zones, covering 1.6 million acres, in which farmers 
will have to modify their use of manure, fertilisers and sludge 
to curb nitrates leaking into rivers and the sea. Many of the 
areas are in East Anglia, where drinking water samples sometimes 
fail European standards. 
  Thirty three areas were also announced where water companies 
will have to fit sewage treatment works with anti-phosphate 
pollution equipment. They cover Windermere and the rivers Avon, 
Test, Blackwater and Nene.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Department of the </F>
Environment: "Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy 
Announced"] 
  [Text] Environment Secretary John Gummer today announced a 
review of radioactive waste management policy to be undertaken 
at the same time as the nuclear review. 
  In answer to a written parliamentary question from Mrs. 
Angela Knight MP (Erewash), Mr. Gummer said: 
  "In parallel with the "Nuclear Review," details of which 
were 
announced today by my honourable friend, the minister for 
energy, my department will be heading a separate but 
complementary review of radioactive waste management policy. 
  "The Radioactive Waste Management Review will examine 
current 
policy in the light of changes which have taken place since the 
department published its "National Strategy" in 1984. It will 
range wider than the nuclear industry, covering radioactive 
waste management as a whole. 
  "It will not address the suitability of specific sites, this 
being a matter for the planning and regulatory process, or the 
merits of the operation of existing nuclear power stations or 
those in the pipeline. 
  "The department proposes to publish its preliminary 
conclusions later in the summer, as a basis for consultation. 
  "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution will also be 
issuing 
for consultation a revision of the Department's 1984 publication 
"Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level 
Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the Human 
Environment." 
  "In parallel with this latter exercise, the Radioactive 
Waste 
Management Advisory Committee [RWMAC], together with the 
Advisory Committee on Safety at Nuclear Installations [ACSNI], 
will be asked to consider the approach to site selection for 
disposal facilities and the criteria for ensuring the protection 
of human health. Further details will be announced later." 
<H5>  Notes to Editors </H5>
  "Radioactive Waste Management: the National Strategy" was 
published by the Department of the Environment in July 1984. It 
set out the government's long-term strategy for the management 
of radioactive wastes, taking account of the latest developments 
at that time. 
  "Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level 
Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the Human 
Environment" was published jointly, in December 1984, by the 
Department of the Environment, Scottish Office, Welsh Office, 
Department of the Environment for Norther Ireland and the 
Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food. It set out the 
principles which the departments proposed to apply in 
considering whether they should give a general authorisation for 
any proposed disposal facility for low and intermediate-level 
radioactive wastes. 
  The RWMAC is an independent body of expects, drawn from a 
wide range of backgrounds, including the nuclear, academic, 
medical and research disciplines. It was established in 1978, in 
response to a recommendation in the Commission on Environmental 
Pollution's sixth report, "Nuclear Power and the Environment," 
and is a source of independent advice to the secretaries of 
state for the environment, Scotland and Wales on matters of 
civil radioactive waste management. 
  The ACSNI was set up in 1977 to advise the HSC [Health and 
Safety Commission] and, where appropriate, secretaries of state 
on major issues affecting the safety of nuclear installations. 
  It is made up of an independent chairman and 12 members 
appointed by the HSC, plus a number of members nominated by the 
Confederation of British Industries and the Trade Union Council. 
ACSNI is assisted by assessors from the nuclear industry, the 
NII [Nuclear Installations Inspectorate] and observers from 
government departments as appropriate.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. IP/94/487: "EU-China Environmental </F>
Cooperation"] 
  [Text] For the two weeks from 23 May to 3 June 1994, a 
delegation of nine officials from the Chinese Government visited 
the European Commission. The group, headed by Mr. Gan Shi Jun, 
the director general for social affairs in the State Science and 
Technology Commission (SSTC) also included representatives from 
the State Planning Commission (SPC) notably Mrs. Chen Yu Lian, 
assistant director general in the regional department of the 
municipality of Beijing. 
  The invitation to visit the Commission was made last 
November. Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, the global nature 
of many environmental problems has become even more evident. 
Cooperation between the industrialised countries needs to be 
complemented by co-operation with other major players, China in 
particular, so that a comprehensive approach to solving global 
environmental problems can be made. As well as visiting centres 
of environmental excellence in France and Germany, the visitors 
heard presentations on EU-China relations, scientific 
cooperation and from various units in the environment 
directorate general (DG XI). 
  The main objective of the visit was to achieve effective and 
fruitful cooperation in the field of the environment between the 
Commission and China, especially in so far as the implementation 
of Agenda 21 (the medium term-plan for achieving sustainable 
development agreed at Rio) is concerned. A key factor in this 
process is the way in which environmental concerns are 
integrated in the planning and execution of economic development 
policy. 
  Commissioner Paleokrassas said that "this visit marks a 
further step in what is expected to become a broader and deeper 
form of environmental cooperation between the Commission and 
China."

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "The World's Big Problem"] </F>
  [Text] The illegal import transaction carried out by 
Produquimica is not an isolated case. Between 1986 and 1993, 
Greenpeace documented 120 export proposals for toxic waste from 
developed countries going to the Third World. Over the past five 
years, the industrialized nations shipped more than 100 million 
t of toxic waste to the underdeveloped countries. More than 
90% 
of the waste sales projects going to the Third World claimed 
that there was a possibility of recycling. 
  Companies that do business with toxic waste cargo are using 
all kinds of expedients to get rid of those cargos. In 1992, the 
German Schmidt-Cretan Company exported 463 t of insecticides to 
Albania labeled as "humanitarian aid." Environmental legislation 
classifies this product as being extremely dangerous and its use 
is prohibited on German territory. In March of that same year, 
one of the two Albanian Government companies that coordinated 
the receipt of the donations asked that cargo shipment be 
interrupted, charging that this "humanitarian aid" had not been 
correctly packaged and that the deadline for its use had already 
run out. 
  After the request, the German company sent another three 
loads of obsolete insecticides to Albania. After they had been 
returned to Germany and once again shipped to Albanian 
territory, the toxic products are today stored in a railroad 
station in Bajza. 
  Another two German companies, ATG and Rimex, likewise 
participated in this new form of "philanthropy," shipping waste 
to the countries of Eastern Europe. ATG signed a presumed 
contract with the Government of Estonia for the export of 
between 500,000 and 800,000 t of used tires per year. According 
to company managers, the tires could be incinerated for the 
production of energy to be used in home heating. Following 
bitter discussions in the Estonian Parliament, 5,000 t were 
burned in the open air in the port of Tallin without producing a 
single watt of energy and emitting a large quantity of particles 
into the atmosphere. 
  Rimex tried to send 78 barrels of burned engine oil to 
Ukraina as donation of "paraffin to the Central Committee of the 
Red Cross for investigations on the biosphere." This "research" 
could not be carried out because the shipment was confiscated by 
Polish customs officers who did not allow the cargo to be 
transported through Polish territory. Cases involving German 
companies gave Germany the title of world champion in the export 
of toxic waste, according to Greenpeace. 
  Other big exporters are Switzerland and the United States. 
Stoller Chemical of the United States in 1992 sold more than 
3,000 t of fertilizer contaminated with ash produced by the 
smelting of copper to the Government of Bangladesh. The 
transaction was financed by the Asian Development Bank. Analyses 
done in the State of South Carolina, where the company is based, 
proved that the fertilizer contained a large quantity of lead 
that causes neurological problems in children as well as cadmium 
that causes damage to the kidneys and is also cancer-causing. 
  In June 1992, the Government of the United States sued 
Stoller and another three companies involved in this case. In 
spite of that, the environmental authorities of the United 
States allowed the toxic cargo to remain in one of the world's 
poorest countries (per capita Gross Domestic Product $220, 
according to UNICEF). Almost one year after the toxic substances 
were found in the cargo, the fertilizer continued to be sold 
freely in Bangladesh. Unofficial reports indicate that the 
government of that country stopped the distribution of toxic 
fertilizer after having sold 33% of the entire shipment. 
  Switzerland annually exports 126,000 t of toxic waste, 
according to the Environmental Ministry of that country; this 
volume is greater than the volume of cheese exports (60,000 t) 
and chocolate exports (67,000 t). 
  The Swiss companies treat the developed and underdeveloped 
countries in a rather egalitarian fashion, shipping toxic cargo 
both to Germany, France, and Belgium as well as to Slovenia and 
Somalia. 
  This European country constantly disregards the Basel 
Convention which was signed on its territory and which calls for 
the sale of toxic cargo only between countries that signed the 
treaty or with others, provided there are bilateral agreements 
between the importing country and the exporting country. The 
Convention's host country has zeroed in on Germany as one of its 
preferred targets for the shipment of toxic waste; Germany did 
not sign the treaty nor does it have an agreement in force with 
Switzerland. 
  The second meeting of the Basel Convention will be held in 
March in Geneva. Greenpeace will submit a proposal to the 
meeting calling for the complete prohibition of exports of toxic 
and hazardous waste from the industrialized countries to those 
of the Third World. According to Marijane Lisboa, Latin American 
coordinator for the Greenpeace Campaign against Trafficking in 
Toxic Waste, the Basel Convention as it stands now "only 
legalizes the immoral commerce in toxic waste."

<F P=106> [Article signed MV/SV/NB: "International Conference on </F>
Control of Chemical Substances Opens in Stockholm"; as released 
by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Stockholm/Bern, 25 April (ATS/DPA) -- The 
international conference on the control of chemical substances 
opened on Monday [25 April] in Stockholm. Over five days, the 
representatives of 130 states, including Switzerland, will 
discuss how to use and transport toxic chemical substances to 
ensure greater respect for the environment. 
  Among the issues that will be discussed are the increased 
production and use of chemical substances in Third World 
countries. These states often do not have the financial 
resources and technical know-how to use these products in an 
environmentally-friendly way. Moreover, these countries are 
increasingly being subjected to toxic waste exports from 
industrialized countries. 
  The Swiss delegation in the Swedish capital is led by Rudolf 
Baerfuss, head of international affairs at the Federal Office of 
the Environment, Forests and Countryside. According to a press 
release issued by the Interior Ministry, the conference should 
decide to increase coordination between the institutions already 
active in the field of dangerous chemical substances. In 
addition, chapter 19 of agenda 21 adopted at the Rio summit in 
June 1992 will be put into effect. 
  The decisions made in Stockholm will be implemented by the 
secretariat of the international program on the safety of 
dangerous substances. This secretariat has been placed under 
the authority of the UN program for the environment, the World 
Health Organization, and the International Labor Organization.

<F P=106> [Paul Brown report: "Pesticides Kill 40,000 a Year Says UN </F>
Expert"] 
  [Text] At least 40,000 people are killed each year by 
misuse of pesticides and up to one million are made ill or 
permanently damaged, Jan Huismans, of the United Nations 
environment programme said yesterday. 
  Many of the chemicals are made in Europe and North America 
and are exported to developing countries where they are used by 
illiterate farmers who have no concept of the damage they are 
doing to themselves, he said. 
  Mr Huismans, who is assistant executive director of the 
unit, 
was speaking on the opening day of the conference in Stockholm, 
aimed at controlling the worldwide use of chemicals. 
  Many of the delegations from 130 countries have been paid 
for 
by the United Kingdom which after the US and Japan is the 
largest contributor to the International Programme of Chemical 
Safety. 
  The big worldwide increase in chemical use has led to 
widespread misapplications on crops and application in climates 
for which the chemicals were not designed. Many of those used 
on food crops have never been tested to see what long-term 
effects they have on the environment or people. 
  Dr Hirishi Nakajimo, director general of the World Health 
Organisation, said in other areas ignorance was also widespread. 
The UN inspectors who visited the Iraq chemical warfare 
factories after the Gulf war were shocked to find operators had 
no idea what they were dealing with. 
  Professor Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister, 
said 
his government was trying to clean up some of the problems in 
Eastern Europe caused by exports from the former East Germany. 
  The Stockholm meeting is the first International Conference 
on Chemical Safety and is expected to set up a worldwide system 
to classify chemicals test them and control their use. 
  Dr Gerald James, from the Department of Health, leading the 
British delegation, said training of people in countries that 
used the chemicals was vital. "People have to realise that 
pesticides are extremely nasty, made deliberately toxic to kill 
something." 
  The UK was keen on the principle of "informed consent". This 
meant that before chemicals were exported the country receiving 
them was fully aware of the dangers if they were not controlled. 
  Sometimes governments receiving the chemicals were informed 
but the people who used them had no idea of the consequences of 
handling them. 
  Professor Topfer said with the world population increasing 
by 
28,000 a day many would starve unless food production was 
stimulated and protected by chemicals.

<F P=106> [Article signed NN/HA: "Switzerland In Favor of a </F>
Convention on Forest Protection"] 
  [Excerpt] New York, 16 May (ATS) -- The UN Commission for 
Lasting Development (CDD) opened its meeting on Monday [16 May] 
in New York. During the next 10 days, the 53 member countries 
will draw up a list of measures to be taken to accelerate the 
implementation of the commitments made in Rio in 1992. 
Switzerland will plead for more equitable trade and for a 
worldwide program on forest protection. It will also advocate 
maintaining the secretariats of three international conventions 
on the environment in Geneva. 
  Established after the Rio Convention, the CDD is the body 
entrusted with implementing the decisions made at the Earth 
Summit. Its second annual session will focus on promoting the 
implementation of specific measures in sectors like chemicals 
processing, environment-friendly production, export of dangerous 
wastes, and the transfer of "soft" technologies. [passage 
omitted] 
  Switzerland will be present as an observer. Under the 
leadership of Rudolf Baerfuss, deputy director of the Federal 
Office for Environment, Forests, and Landscape, the Swiss 
delegation will promote the drafting of an international 
convention on the protection of forests, Monica Linn Locher, the 
delegation's spokeswoman, said. The negotiations look difficult 
as many developing countries have expressed serious reservations. 
  The promotion of a more equitable worldwide and 
environment-friendly trade will also be supported by 
Switzerland. Switzerland advocates enhancing the role of the UN 
environment program to foster the ecological aspect of trade 
exchanges. In this context, the final preparations for the GATT 
negotiations are impatiently awaited. 
<H5>  Lobby for Geneva </H5>
  The Swiss delegation will take advantage of this opportunity 
to secure the international status of Geneva. It will strive to 
ensure that the provisional secretariats of the international 
conventions on climate, biodiversity, and deforestation are 
maintained in Geneva. The negotiations will be difficult. Bonn 
has applied to host the secretariat of the convention on 
climate, Madrid on biodiversity, Spain again and Kenya on 
deforestation. 
  Switzerland has some assets, Mrs. Linn Locher says. However, 
no decision will be made until the end of this year for the 
convention on biodiversity and until next year for the two other 
conventions.

  [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- China has vowed to 
strengthen the protection and control of the country's forest 
resources, according to a circular issued by the State Council 
recently. 
  According to the circular, the country's timber consumption 
climbed, and the cut in some localities was on the rise. 
  In response, the circular urged governments at all levels 
and 
relevant departments to pay special attention to the protection 
and management of forest resources, saying that the limit on 
timber cuts and transport licensing system should be enforced 
strictly. 
  Also, and the management of forest area use and the 
protection of wildlife and rare plants should be considered an 
important duty of local authorities, said the circular, noting 
that those caught destroying the forest will be punished 
severely.

  [Text] Beijing, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- The State Council's 
General Office recently issued a circular on improving the 
protection and management of forest resources. The circular 
said: In recent years, various localities have made new headway 
in accelerating the pace of afforestation and greening, and in 
improving the protection of forest resources. Some new problems 
have arisen in our forestry sector, however. Chief among them 
are an increase in the excessive consumption of forest 
resources, the rather serious problem of logging in excess of 
authorized quotas, and the renewed practices of indiscriminately 
felling and logging trees and of recklessly capturing and 
hunting wildlife. People's governments at all levels and all 
relevant departments should take these problems seriously, and 
they should earnestly study ways to solve them. 
  In the circular, the State Council's General Office said 
emphatically: Although our country has achieved growth in both 
forested areas and forest reserves, it is still deficient in 
forests, with dwindling full-grown or overgrown forest 
resources. People's governments at all levels should take 
forestry-related work seriously. We should make use of all 
economic and legal means, adopt administrative measures which 
are conducive to the protection and development of forest 
resources, and devote earnest efforts to protecting and managing 
forest resources. 
  First, we should strictly implement the system of logging 
quotas and timber transportation based on relevant documents. 
Annual logging quotas, which are approved by the State Council 
for prescribed periods, represent the maximum consumption 
amounts for various localities when they exploit forest 
resources; they are legally binding. No localities may surpass 
the quotas without the approval of the State Council or other 
authorized units. In the second half of 1994, all localities 
should extensively review the progress of recent years in 
enforcing logging quotas, and strictly deal with units that 
exceed logging quotas. We should continue the policy of 
allowing forestry departments to exercise unified management and 
organize trips into the mountains to buy timber from key 
timber-producing counties, and may not willfully abolish timber 
inspection stations established in accordance with the law. 
Railways and transportation departments should maintain the 
system of transporting timber based on relevant documents. 
Administrative organs and law enforcement departments are 
strictly forbidden to run logging operations under various 
pretexts and in various forms. 
  Second, we should tighten supervision and management over 
woodland utilization and implement the system of compensated 
woodland utilization. Units and individuals which have not 
attended to relevant procedures in accordance with the law may 
not, under any pretext, occupy or allot for free utilization 
woodland which is used by state-owned forestry enterprises and 
institutions. Forestry rights certificates are legal documents 
attesting to ownership rights to forests, timber, and woodland. 
People's governments at all levels should review illegal 
woodland appropriation and occupation since the second half of 
1992; set deadlines for attending to procedures for examination, 
approval, and compensation; and retake illegally appropriated 
and occupied woodland upon failure to complete such procedures. 
  Third, we should conscientiously improve the protection and 
management of wildlife and rare plants. People's governments at 
all levels should take wildlife and rare plant protection as 
their important duty, institute an on-the-job responsibility 
system, and implement various protection measures. 
  Fourth, we should improve forestry administration and basic 
services regarding forest resources, and stabilize the 
forestry-related law-enforcement ranks. People's governments at 
all levels, particularly county-level forestry departments, 
should place a premium on basic services such as forest resource 
protection and management. They should stabilize the ranks of 
managerial and law-enforcement personnel for forestry 
administration, forestry-related public security, timber 
inspection stations, and forestry work stations. They should 
actively solve practical staffing and funding problems, and 
foster good working conditions for such personnel. 
  Fifth, we should sternly combat all kinds of illegal and 
criminal activities which destroy forest resources. People's 
governments at all levels should take resolute measures against, 
and devote special efforts to cracking down expeditiously on, 
illegal and criminal acts committed by various people's 
governments to pilfer and clandestinely log trees owned by the 
state and collectives; to occupy woodland illegally; to hunt, 
smuggle, and trade illegally in wildlife and allied products 
which are on the state's priority protection list; to damage 
rare plants; and to beat up and injure forestry-related 
law-enforcement personnel. 
  Sixth, we should uphold the responsibility system based on 
tenure-specific objectives under which leading cadres protect 
and develop forest resources. Forest resource protection and 
management are an important duty of people's governments at all 
levels. We should take the growth and depletion of forest 
resources as one of the criteria against which to evaluate the 
performance of leaders at all levels, especially those at the 
county and township levels. We must investigate the 
responsibility of key administrative leaders if they have caused 
heavy losses through their failure to effectively halt the 
practices of indiscriminately felling and logging trees, 
illegally occupying woodland, and recklessly capturing and 
hunting wildlife while they are in office. We should commend 
and reward those who have achieved remarkable results in 
protecting, nurturing, and developing forest resources.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 2 (CNS) -- According to the 
Bulletin of Environmental Protection, environmental pollution in 
Guangzhou is by and large under the control. However, measures 
curbing pollution in the city are still inadequate, in view of 
the growth of pollution. 
  Though industrial pollution is initially under the control, 
environmental pollution is still rather serious. For instance, 
organic contamination in the water of the Guangzhou part of the 
Pearl River is getting worse. Disposal of urban refuse is still 
a headache. Harmful industrial rubbish has not yet all been 
collected together to be disposed of. Growth of the number of 
motor vehicles is too fast, and their exhaust gas resulting in 
polluting the air. Noise pollution along the sides of main 
traffic lines remains high. Environmental administration over 
the tertiary industry is lagged behind its development. Urban 
residents are seriously suffering from waste water, waste gas 
and noise caused by the food industry there. Some enterprises 
are still shifting their responsibility of curbing their own 
pollution to society, aiming at making profit at the expense of 
people there. 
  According to an official from the Guangzhou Municipal 
Environmental Protection Committee, Guangzhou would be built 
into a metropolis of international standard in five years time, 
and 1994 is a crucial year for the realization of the goal. 
Protection of environment must keep up with the development of 
economy. The plan for the protection of environment must be 
worked out in conformity with the total urban construction plan 
and the plan of municipal economic development. Departments of 
Urban construction, municipal administration, environmental 
protection and public utilities must take effective measures to 
speed up construction of projects for disposal of waste water 
and urban refuse, strengthen administration over and harness 
motor vehicles' exhaust gas, strengthen supervision over 
environment of food industry and control motor vehicles' noise 
pollution so as to improve environment for people's living. At 
the same time, Guangzhou municipality will further improve its 
laws and regulations on environment, endeavor to make publicity 
of the importance of environmental protection so as to enhance 
people's understanding of environmental protection.

  [Text] Washington, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank today 
approved a credit of 150 million U.S. dollars to help restore 
China's heavily eroded loess plateau and lift 1.2 million people 
out of poverty. 
  The bank said that soil erosion has made China's loess 
plateau "something like the surface of the moon," and that per 
capita income there is only about 35 to 50 dollars a year. 
  The bank said the project seeks to tackle the issue of 
poverty and the environment at the same time and is expected to 
increase grain production by 50 percent and fruit production by 
400 percent. 
  "The little rainfall the people get will be kept for crops 
and trees, where now it just runs off," said the bank's project 
manager Juergen Voegele. 
  "They will also be able to convert highly eroded areas to 
production, utilize river beds and move away from unproductive 
and unsustainable planting on sloping hillsides," he said. 
  The total cost of the project is close to 250 million 
dollars.

<F P=106> [By reporters Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769) and Kong Xiangying </F>
(1313 4382 6601)] 
  [Text] Hefei, 26 May (XINHUA) -- An on-the-spot meeting 
sponsored by the State Council Environmental Protection 
Committee on reviewing the law enforcement of environmental 
protection in the Huai He basin concluded in Bangbu, Anhui, 
today. During the meeting, a plan for controlling water 
pollution in the Huai He basin was adopted, ushering in a 
massive effort to control pollution there. 
  State Councillor Song Jian, who is also in charge of the 
State Council Environmental Protection Committee, said that it 
is necessary to take economic, administrative, and legal 
measures to control the Huai He's pollution within a set time so 
as to achieve the goal of making the Huai He clean by the end of 
this century. 
  During the meeting, leaders from four riparian provinces 
along the Huai He -- Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong -- as 
well as responsible people of relevant state ministries and 
commissions adopted a plan for pollution control in the Huai He 
basin after carefully analyzing the river's pollution and 
control situation. To control Huai He pollution, the following 
efforts will be made: The State Council Environmental 
Protection Committee and the Water Resources Ministry will take 
the lead in forming a Huai He water quality control 
organization, with the participation of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, 
and Shandong and relevant State Council departments. The 
organization will be responsible for coordinating and planning 
the overall control of the Huai He's pollution. A Huai He water 
quality pollution control monitoring network will be established 
and improved to conduct dynamic monitoring of the river's 
mainstream and all major tributaries and carry out a target and 
comprehensive control of pollution in all of its sections. A 
group of enterprises along the Huai He whose pollution is severe 
and hard to control will be closed down, suspended, merged with 
other enterprises, or their product lines changed in three 
years. The first batch of enterprises whose pollution is severe 
and whose economic performance is poor will be closed down, 
suspended, merged with other enterprises, or product lines 
changed this year. In addition, 200 control projects will be 
accomplished in three years. By 2000, all riparian cities and 
counties along the river must build water pollution treatment 
facilities suitable to local conditions. It is necessary to 
formulate relevant laws and regulations concerning the control 
of the Huai He's pollution to put the control work on a legal 
track. The meeting urged the four riparian provinces to carry 
out and accomplish the control plan included in the "Eighth 
Five-Year program." Any construction projects that might cause 
severe pollution will be banned in the future. 
  State Councillor Song Jian said: In controlling the Huai 
He's pollution, it is necessary to have a resolute attitude and 
action and carry out the work in a planned and systematic way. 
In this way, we can achieve practical results. We will never 
leave the polluted Huai He to the next century. Riparian local 
governments at all levels should conscientiously strengthen 
their leadership and supervision and inspection. They must 
carry out the water pollution control plan. They must clearly 
define their responsibility and achieve their goals within the 
set time. Any units that are slack in carrying out pollution 
control measures or shift their responsibility onto others and 
cause bad consequences will be criticized in circulars. If a 
case is serious, their leaders shall be investigated and affixed 
the responsibility for it. 
  Song Jian said: In controlling the Huai He's pollution, it 
is necessary to adhere to the principle that "polluters are 
responsible for cleaning up." Through the cleaning-up process, 
it is imperative to help cadres and people living along the Huai 
He foster a sense of importance to protect the environment. We 
should establish a new norm of social behavior that is 
beneficial to the environmental protection. The drive to 
control the Huai He's pollution is China's first attempt to 
clean up the whole basin of a river that flows through several 
provinces. This will be a giant project involving a wide 
stretch of areas and many people. Under the leadership of the 
CPC Central Committee and the State Council, we should mobilize 
leaders at all levels and the broad masses of the people to 
actively participate in the work. We should launch a joint 
effort to control pollution in the Huai He. We must make the 
Huai He clean again in this century and provide experiences and 
methods for the drive to clean up other transregional rivers in 
China.

<F P=106> [Article by Peng Keshan 1756 3784 3790]] </F>
  [Text]Land is the mother of wealth, and it is the basic 
building block for human existence and development. It is 
China's fundamental national policy to treasure and tend every 
inch of the land and especially to protect arable lands. But, 
China's land environment has been deteriorating for many years, 
and the question of how to deal with it becomes more critical 
every day, as it directly affects agricultural development, and 
by extension, the stability of the society, the economy, and the 
government. How to tackle the many issues of the land 
environment is a new task facing social workers and the labor 
force, and the preeminent requirement for economic growth and 
stability is the protection of agricultural lands. 
<H8>  The Present Situation </H8>
  There is only .086 hectare of cultivated land per person in 
China, one-third of the world average of .32 hectare. Less than 
one in ten of all the fields of the 95.7 million hectares of 
cultivated land have high and sustainable productivity, and 
there are 15 million hectares of low-productive, 
saline-alkaline, marshy, frigid, red-earth, water-eroded, 
sand-blown, arid, and coastal beach lands. Cultivated land is 
becoming a scarce resource, and this has not been given 
sufficient attention or has been overlooked for a long time. In 
the 20-year period from 1957 to 1977, 29.3 million hectares of 
arable land have been used for various kinds of construction or 
abandoned to waste, while 17.3 million hectares have been 
brought under cultivation, a net loss of 11.2 million hectares, 
equivalent to the sum of the cultivated areas of Guangdong, 
Guangxi, and Sichuan, an average loss per year of the total 
cultivated land in Fujian. From 1978 to 1990, 307,000 hectares 
of cultivated land disappeared. According to international 
standards, the danger point is reached when cultivated land is 
reduced to .053 hectare per person, and China's is presently at 
.086 hectares per person. Among the 26 countries with the 
highest ratio of cultivated land to population, China places 
24th, and with the population increasing at a rate of 16 million 
per year, having reached 1.16 billion by 1 July 1990, will top 
1.3 billion by the end of the century. Adding on to that a loss 
of 11.8 million hectares to capital construction in urban and 
rural areas, in time, when cultivated land averages .0667 
hectare per person overall, many provinces will range between 
.047 and 053 hectare, and the danger point will have been 
reached, and that is the situation that China is facing in its 
agricultural development. Even though there are still 13 million 
hectares of feral land, it is distributed over the frontier, and 
it is of poor quality, and it is not easily brought under 
cultivation without high investment. Arable lands that has been 
taken over in recent years are good fields and flatlands located 
around towns and cities, which further reduces the 
land-to-people ratio of arable land resources. This is the 
situation China faces nationwide, while at the same time wanting 
the country to be rich, the people strong, and the quality of 
life to be steadily rising, and China is thus presented with a 
dilemma and a formidable task. 
<H8>  The Problems </H8>
  The deterioration of land environment is the result of the 
disappearance and degradation of land caused by various kinds of 
natural and social activities which leads to the loss of and 
damage to the land environment. There are six primary 
manifestations. 
<H5>  (1) Hundreds of Thousands of hectares of Arable Land </H5>
Disappear Every Year. 
  The old pattern of ever expanding arable land in China 
reversed itself in 1957, and the downward trend has been getting 
worse day by day. Since 1978 the annual loss has been as high as 
307,000 hectares. The primary causes are as follows: 
  1. The demand for living space is increasing. With steady 
increase in farm incomes and reduction in the size of farm 
families, old farm dwellings are being repaired and new ones 
built, and rural villages are constantly expanding. 
Investigations have found that in the 4 years from 1985 through 
1988, 277,000 hectares of farm land have been taken up for the 
construction of farm dwellings, and one-third of all the farm 
land in the country has been taken for construction of every 
kind. In 1990, 24,000 hectares of land was converted to farm 
dwellings, and the area of village housing grew, and as living 
space encroached on the surrounding farm land, arable land 
disappeared day by day. 
  2. Capital construction is swallowing up the land. Economic 
growth since 1978 has caused a boom in capital construction to 
improve the economic and investment environment on every level 
and by any means, and a lot of land has been taken out of 
agriculture; and because of reckless and incautious land 
management operations, many construction units are grabbing land 
for use later or taking land they don't use, and a lot of it is 
good land in cities towns and villages. Besides that, there is a 
fever from top down for building roads, for village and town 
enterprises, city construction, real estate, and for opening up 
zones, are all important factors in the disappearance of 
farmland. In 1992 alone, 1.33 million hectares were taken up for 
development zones and real estate. 
  On top of that, unprocessable trash occupies up to 80,000 
hectares of farmland throughout the country. 
<H5>  (2) Soil Fertility is in Decline. </H5>
  Soil fertility is an important indicator of land quality. 
The 
long history of heavy use and little replenishment has caused a 
steady drop in soil fertility levels, and that is an important 
factor in ruination of the land environment. 
  1. The organic quality of soils is declining. The amount of 
organic content is important to improving the structure and 
permeability of the soil. In recent years there has been an 
evident drop in the organic quality of the soil around the 
country, which reduces the soil quality. Investigation of 1,403 
Counties in 1986 showed that the overall ratio of agricultural 
fields of mid- to low-levels of productivity had increased from 
60 percent to 80 percent, and 11 percent had organic measures of 
less that .6 percent. 
  2. There is a deficiency in nitrogen, phosphorus, and 
potassium. According to incomplete statistics, 59 percent of 
China's arable land is phosphorus deficient, 23 percent lacks 
potassium, and 14 percent is lacking phosphorus and potassium. 
  3. Fewer areas are using organic fertilizers for crops. The 
use of chemical fertilizers is increasing and many farmers are 
overlooking the value of organic fertilizers, reducing the 
amount of land for crops, and narrowing the range of soil 
fertility sources. Neglecting to store up organic fertilizers or 
to make compost, has turned a lot of farmland into "sanitary 
fields". 
<H5>  (3) There is Serious Soil Pollution. </H5>
  In the wake of human activity and environmental change, 
especially in the last 10 years, industrial pollutants (the 3 
wastes), and the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in 
agriculture has been damaging to the land ecological environment. 
  1. Industrial wastes, "the 3 wastes". There are about 10 
million hectares of farmland now being polluted by the "3 
wastes" and 907,000 hectares of farmland are polluted by 
agricultural chemical products, the discharge of the "3 wastes" 
is greatly increased by the rapid development of industry, and 
much land around industrial and mining enterprises is polluted 
and farmland is deteriorating. 
  2. Chemical pesticides. Spraying of large volumes of 
chemical 
pesticides also causes soil pollution. Between 12.7 million and 
16 million hectares of China's farmland is polluted by 
pesticides. According to findings by the Ministry of 
Agricultural, the residue levels of "666" in the topsoil is .72 
mg\kg, DDT is .42mg\kg, and in many areas non-biodegradable 
residues of organic chlorine pesticides in the soil are 
increasing annually. Many economically developed areas are also 
experiencing fairly high levels of soil pollution because the 
use of chemical fertilizers in increasing and they are being 
improperly used. 
  3. Acid Rain. The discharge of large volumes of industrial 
gases and dust is causing acid rain in many areas. The State 
Meteorological Administration has found that the acidity of 
precipitation is on a strong upward trend, acid rain is evident 
in 20 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, 2.7 million 
hectares of farmland are now being polluted by acid rain, and 
this alone is costing 2 billion yuan in losses to agriculture. 
Precipitation in Chongqing has an annual average pH level of 
4.12, and the acid rain level is up to 90 percent. The soil 
there is clearly acidified. 
<H5>  (4) Soil Erosion </H5>
  Soil erosion in unlevel terrain can readily cause damage to 
topsoil, soil nutrition, and reduce the quality of topsoil. 
China is among those countries in the world that have serious 
erosion problems. According to the mid-December issue of the 
Chinese Science Daily, 3.75 million square kilometers of land is 
being eroded away, and since Reconstruction, four-fifths of the 
land suffering from erosion has yet to be brought under control, 
and in controlled areas, for every residence that has been 
brought under control there are many that have not, and the 
trend is for erosion to spread more every year. 
<H5>  (5) Spreading Sands </H5>
  Sand is spreading over the land at a much faster rate than 
it 
is being brought under control, 24.2 percent of the national 
territory is desert, and 18.3 percent is turning into desert, 
and 47.3 percent has the potential for becoming desert. Yellow 
sand damage spreads at a rapid rate of 4.93 million hectares per 
year. About 10 million hectares of arable land and grassland are 
in danger of being overcome by sand, and every year another 
133,000 to 200,000 hectares are damaged and disappearing. 
<H5>  (6) The Frequency of Natural Disasters </H5>
  Between 1949 and 1990 there have been over 40,000 geological 
disasters, and over 2,000 have caused major damage; 405,000 
human lives have been lost, over 1 million people injured, and 
economic losses amount to 10 million yuan. Over 300 billion yuan 
in losses have been caused by various kinds of geological 
disasters in a period of over 40 years. Weather has caused many 
disasters. In 1991 alone, 55.47 million hectares of farmland 
were damaged, directly causing economic losses of up to 120.4 
billion yuan. Meanwhile droughts, landslides, hail damage, and 
frost damage are increasing in the western regions. At the start 
of the Liberation, droughts occurred once every 10 years and in 
the 80s it was every 6 years. In the east there are floods, dry 
spells, typhoons, and coastal erosion, and in 1991, 24.596 
hectares of farmland were affected by floods caused by storms 
causing disastrous damage to 14.614 million hectares of land, 
which was the worst year for flood damage to farmland since 
1949, causing over 70 billion yuan in economic losses. 
<H8>  Corrective Measures </H8>
<H5>  (1) Strengthen the Legal System and Education, and Raise the </H5>
Consciousness for "Cherishing the Land". 
  Protecting land resources is everybody's business, and the 
first order of business is to raise the people's consciousness 
to "cherish the land". The State Council has designated the 25th 
of June to be the annual "Earth Alert Day". Various level 
organizations will make the publicizing of the "earth management 
laws" a long-term mission, and will put it on the agenda of all 
levels of the Party and Government. 
<H5>  (2) Perfect the Earth Contract System, and Stabilize </H5>
Contract Policy. 
  As China's socialist market economy developed and reforms 
advanced, the transformation of the land system became an agenda 
item, and the continued improvement of the land-contract system 
became the main issue in deepening agricultural reform. The 
implementation of a long-term earth "entrenchment" policy grew 
out of the need to control the growth of the agricultural 
population. The issuing of licenses for long-term land 
cultivation was seen as an effective systematic method for 
putting the brakes on short-sighted and rapacious management 
practices, and to improve the basic environment and support 
structure for agriculture and its development. 
<H5>  (3) Set up a Tax Recycling System, and Collect Land Taxes. </H5>
  So that land-use fees will not increase the burden on 
farmers, they will be apportioned into the total sum of contract 
fees paid by farm residences. State land laws and regulations 
define the scope and standards for collection of 
land-cultivation taxes and urban land-use taxes. The execution 
of these laws and regulations is important to the protection of 
land resources and controlling the growth of the population. It 
is suggested that the State apply different tax rates to the 
different qualities of arable land resources to control the 
disappearance of arable lands. Part of the land taxes are to be 
used for intensified development of land resources, solve 
economic difficulties in the process of land development, lessen 
the financial pressures on the State, make more comprehensive 
use of land resources, and raise the technical level scientific 
research. 
<H5>  (4) Raise the Awareness of the National Situation, and Make </H5>
Sensible Use of the Land. 
  To break the conundrum of losing land and gaining people day 
after day, the popular idea that China is a vast territory with 
boundless resources must be replaced by a new awareness of the 
national situation, and the recognition that Chinese agriculture 
is in a dire strait. Take a scientific attitude and realistic 
approach toward the land environment, and put controls on all 
farming practices to constantly raise the economic returns to 
society from the smallest plots of land, and maximize 
conservation of farmland. The development and use of land 
resources should not be limited to arable land, but should 
include the development of larger areas of land resources with 
good potential. Change the traditional dependency on cereals to 
a modern concept of food, engender a macro-agricultural concept 
of planting, till when it is warranted, let grasslands be 
grasslands and forests be forests, suit measures to local 
conditions, coordinate tilling and husbandry of resources 
sensibly, and apply the principle of combined social, economic 
and ecological benefits in land utilization. 
<H5>  (5) Apply Comprehensive measures, and Control Land Pollution. </H5>
  Industrial discharge of the "3 wastes" is a source of land 
pollution. To control pollution, the internal and external 
environments of industrial production must be rectified. 
Combined administrative, economical, and legal action is needed 
to solve the question of industrial pollutants in urban areas. 
Sources of excessive pollution should be inspected and corrected 
in minimum time. There should be strict examination and approval 
processes for new construction, reconstruction and expansion 
projects to control new sources of pollution. As to the matter 
of putting controls on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, 
there should be: 1. multi-type mixtures and careful selection of 
raw materials before manufacture; 2. Effective, low-toxic and 
bio-degradable pesticides should be produced to replace the 
production of high-toxic, ineffective pesticides that have 
serious residual effects; and 3. There should be more research 
and dissemination of new fertilizers and pesticides with an aim 
toward achieving low-cost products that have little or no 
harmful side effects. While working for all of that, there must 
be better control, overall planning, and rational distribution 
of small-town industrial environments and new sources of 
pollution. 
<H5>  (6) Control erosion, and Prevent the Spread of Sandy and </H5>
Salty Soils 
  A combination of tilling, biological, and engineering 
measures is needed to control erosion. The rural energy 
structure needs to be reformed, fuel-saving stoves, methane, 
small hydroelectric and solar energy facilities should be 
developed, and better water conservancy construction and a line 
of commercial foodstuffs, oils and cotton bases are needed. 
<H5>  (7) Control Population Growth, and Implement Control Methods </H5>
  The population load-bearing capacity of China's territory is 
at a critical point. Population growth is out of hand, and 
arable land is diminishing. According to the calculations of 
United Nations agricultural organizations, the median level of 
food consumption will be reached in 2050, and the minimum per 
capita consumption of food should be 500-600 kilograms. If China 
population reaches 1.5 billion as expected, a minimum of 120 
million hectares of arable land will be needed. Chinese farmers 
now make up approximately 72.6 percent of the whole population, 
and their age structure is rather young, which presents a huge 
latent reproduction potential. Therefore population growth must 
be strictly controlled, especially the growth of the rural 
population.

of Geography 
  [Text]China's economy will double between now and the year 
2000, and China will begin to stand among the world's major 
economic powers. By 2020, China will have basically achieved it 
mid-range goal of industrialization, and its socio-economic 
development will basically have caught up to the level of 
advanced nations. In the quarter century before this goal is 
reached, it will be difficult to reverse the trend of a steadily 
worsening environment, but the country and the society must 
first lay down a specific policy before it can reduce the threat 
and pressures of environmental degradation; After the first 20 
years of the 21st century, China's ecological environment can be 
genuinely improved, and economic development and the ecological 
environment can begin to move forward on a coordinated course. 
  China Will Be Faced with Serious Environmental Pollution 
Problems in the Next 25 Years 
  China must wage a protracted struggle to maintain suitably 
rapid economic growth. 
  Between the 1950's and 1973, most of the world's developed 
nations saw a sustained economic development, but they created 
rather serious industrial pollution. In 1972 the U.N. Human 
Environment Conference was held in Stockholm, and the "U.N. 
Human Environment Report" was issued. It was recognized that 
population growth and economic development were the basic causes 
of the various pollution and ecological environment problems. 
Western scholars, represented by the "Roman Club" felt that the 
economic growth of various countries should be limited, and they 
advocated the "low growth" and "no growth" ideas. The per-capita 
GNP of the countries where those experts lived was between $U.S. 
15,000 and 25,000, and even at that rate the proponents of those 
ideas could not get any concurrence. China cannot accept "low 
growth", much less "no growth". China's GNP averaged to the 
population is only several hundred U.S. dollars, and China is 
facing enormous pressures of rapid development, expanding 
industries, rapidly rising incomes and standard of living. If it 
were only a question of a rapid development, then the question 
of the ecological environment could be gradually solved. With 
the booming economic development and influx of foreign 
investments following the reforms in China, a six to eight 
percent economic growth rate probably can be maintained for some 
time. After 2020, the per capita gross national output value 
will be about $U.S. 3,000 to 5,000, after which economic growth 
will gradually level out, and the post-industrial stage will 
have been reached. 
  In the first and middle stages of industrialization, the 
economy will grow rapidly, and industries that consume large 
amounts of raw materials and discharge large amounts of wastes 
will inevitably play a primary role in that growth. 
  The steel and petroleum industries and the chemical 
industries, building materials, thermal power, and paper are all 
big consumers of raw materials and discharge large volumes of 
pollutants, they belong to the three big ministries and the six 
big enterprises who are the "big polluters". Because China was a 
late starter in industrialization, the internal demands and 
pressures are great, and these industries are in a long 
historical process and still must quickly increase in scale. 
  By the end of this century steel production will have 
reached 
about 90 million tons, but China wants it to continue its growth 
up to 2015, and a series of large- and middle-sized steel mills 
will be built and expanded to make that possible. There are 
nearly 20 large-scale petroleum bases in China today, and the 
ethylene production capacity, existing and under construction, 
is nearly three million tons, not one-fifth that of the U.S., 
and well below China's needs. By 2020, in addition to the 
large-scale bases mentioned, more than 10 new bases will be 
needed. Because of the low level of electrification in China, 
and 70 percent of that is coal-power, and that can't be changed 
much, but while nuclear and hydropower are increasing, the 
desired new increase in thermal power will be 130,000MW to 
150,000MW, and over 60 2,400MW big thermal power plants will 
have to be built. Cement, paper, and common non-ferrous metals 
will likewise need to be increased on a large scale. 
  China's population has maintained strong growth over the 
last 
25 years, and between 2010 and 2020 it will peak out; The 
massive urbanization of the population will change the 
consumption structure considerably, adding to the consumption of 
energy and water, and waste discharge will also be on the 
increase. 
  The per-capita consumption of energy in cities is three to 
five times the rural rate, and the consumption of fresh water is 
also much greater. If the population migration is not 
controlled, by 2010, about 500 million people will be living in 
urban areas, of which probably 200 million will be in clustered 
towns in large- and middle-sized cities. They will be crowded 
for space, and basic facilities will be lacking, adding to the 
industrial and urban pollution, which will intensify the 
ecological and social problems in those areas. After 2020, the 
total population and rate of urbanization will diminish, and the 
pressures on the ecological environment will ease. 
  The people's average income is still very low, and large 
amounts of money will not be available for environmental 
controls and ecological construction for some time to come. 
  Only through rapid development, namely through raising the 
economic strength and level of well being, can any good portion 
of the redistributed people's income be put into the protection 
of the ecological environment. The U.S. is now putting two to 
three percent of the people's output value into controlling 
pollution, and in China, it is about one percent, and that is 
not being used to full advantage for a variety of reasons. 
<H5>  Two Strategic Ecological Environment Policies Must Be </H5>
Implemented Simultaneously 
  China faces two kinds of ecological environment issues: 
  1. those primarily due to natural forces and human 
agricultural practices; 
  2. those primarily due to industrialization and 
urbanization processes. 
  Because of drawbacks in China's natural geographical 
structure, large population, and unwise use of wastelands, there 
has been serious erosion, encroachment of sand and salt, 
diminishing grassland, and desiccation, which fall under the 
first category of environmental issues. The second category 
includes water, air, and land pollution, acid rain, the 
greenhouse effect caused by CO[.sub]2[/] emissions, the 
rising sea level, surface subsidence, sea-water encroachment, 
insufficient water in concentrated industrial and urban areas, 
overcrowding, and lack of minimal supplies for capital 
construction, all caused by the industrialization and social 
urbanization processes. These two categories of environmental 
issues differ in respect of their formation and harmful effects, 
and in their means of control. 
  China must, therefore, implement two different strategic 
policies for correcting these environmental problems. 
  In the 40 years since reconstruction, there has grown a 
general recognition of the effects of natural forces and 
agricultural practices on the ecological environment, and State 
and local funds, manpower, and materials have been put into the 
effort to control and prevent ecological damage, including 
scientific research and experimentation, which have had varying 
degrees of success in reducing the worsening trend in ecological 
problems. 
  The problems of pollution and other ecological environmental 
issues caused by industrialization and urbanization have gotten 
much attention since the 1970's, but the public consciousness 
has yet to be sharpened on these issues. It should be regarded 
with alarm that these pollution problems are growing worse every 
day in the process of the rapidly developing economy, and 
although public opinion, local governments, and basic 
enterprises keep saying they want to control pollution, that 
fact is that for financial, organizational, technical, 
facilities, and management reasons, corrective actions to deal 
with these environmental phenomena have still not reached 
widespread governmental and social application. Therefore, 
during the course of 20 years of economic growth, environmental 
pollution has spread, and the threat has worsened. The rate of 
ecological degradation from the second category of causes grows 
much faster than that of the first category. 
  To infuse a lasting health into the diversified areas of the 
society and the economy, the measures for implementing the 
strategic policy of operating simultaneously on the two 
categories of environmental issues, namely; continuing to 
improve comprehensive controls on erosion, desert encroachment, 
floods and droughts, while striving at the same to control 
environmental pollution, surface subsidence and sea-water 
encroachment, eliminate acid rain, and apply measures to improve 
the living conditions in secondary urbanization areas, should be 
elevated to status of the consummate strategy for creating a 
better world for the future generations. The sure course for 
reaching this strategic goal is: 
  (1) Improve theoretical and applied research on human, 
natural resource, and environmental interrelationships, learn 
their interrelational operating mechanisms, and publicize it 
widely among the populace. 
  (2) Allocate a higher proportion of the people's income for 
environmental controls. As the economy develops rapidly, the 
government and enterprises should put more money into improving 
the environment and controlling industrial pollution. Try to get 
the amount of the gross value of national production that is put 
into the ecological environment up to two percent by turn of 
century. 
  (3) Implement macro-adjustments and controls on the 
distribution of national industries in long- and mid-term 
measures fitted to the special natural environmental features of 
the various large regions and the load-bearing capability of 
their environments. 
  (4) Clarify the responsibilities for pollution control, and 
reform the product cost-accounting process. Enterprises should 
factor into the production costs of their products all of the 
funds that were needed for pollution control, tailored by the 
amount of threat posed to society by their discharged wastes, 
and other losses incurred therein, and the government should 
pick up a part of that cost for input into special environmental 
foundations to be used for environmental protection projects. 
  (5) Be frugal in the use of resources, and set up a 
resource-saving socio-economic system. That should include 
creating industrial structures that have low-intensities of 
resource consumption, developing industrial technologies that 
conserve or re-use resources and reduce the amounts of 
discharged wastes.

<F P=106> [Excerpts from article by Chen Shuxian [7115 0647 6343]: </F>
"Accelerating Solid Waste Legislation Cannot Be Delayed"] 
  [Excerpts] The development of production inevitably leads 
to consumption of resources, and as resources are developed the 
inevitable result is a substantial increase in solid wastes and 
ecological and environmental destruction. Household wastes are 
now increasing at an alarming rate. In the developed country 
Germany, for example, the amount of garbage per capita doubled 
from the 1950's to 1990's, and the amount of garbage per capita 
in West Germany in 1989 was 239 kilograms. It is no wonder that 
people have exclaimed that "mankind will drown in the garbage it 
has created". 
  China is a developing country and reform and opening up have 
spurred rapid economic development. As production develops and 
people's living standards improve, we similarly will face heavy 
pressures from growing amounts of solid wastes. Statistics show 
that industrial residues reached about 700 million tons in 1991 
and per capita household garbage in urban areas has now reached 
440 kilograms and is growing at an annual rate of eight to 10 
percent. 
  [passage omitted] 
  The Chinese Government has consistently advocated the 
rational and full use of resources and protection of the 
environment is an established basic national policy. The 
government has conducted broad-ranging propaganda in this area 
that has now effectively aroused people's environmental 
consciousness. However, our countermeasures and measures would 
seem to be ineffective, especially in the areas of using 
administrative legislation to strengthen restrictions on the 
generation of solid wastes and in their recovery and 
utilization, where we lag far behind the developed countries. 
Thus, it is essential that we strengthen legislation to increase 
restrictions on the generation of solid wastes and require their 
re-use to the greatest possible extent to protect resources and 
the environment, avoid taking the winding path of the developed 
countries, and deal with the matter of creating prosperity for 
generations of our descendants as quickly as possible. 
  [passage omitted] 
  China is now in the process of making a transition to a 
market economy, and improving packaging designs is an essential 
way for enterprises to make their products more competitive. 
Thus, in shortening the useful lifespans of products and 
improving packaging designs, enabling resource utilization and 
recovery is a question that is very deserving of attention, but 
it is ignored by most enterprises at the present time. 
  Because of the growing amount of solid wastes arising from 
packaging and the continual renovation that is going on now, 
many countries have formulated specialized decrees to restrict 
the generation of solid wastes from packaging and help expanded 
reproduction and utilization. Thus, formulation of the related 
decrees is the key step, especially in the future when China's 
enterprises become independently managed legal persons and the 
government's use of legislation will be an important way to 
implement macro management.

<F P=106> [Article by Yang Shuzhen [2799 2885 3791]: "Concern for </F>
Jiaozhou Bay"] 
  [Text] Qingdao, known as the "Jewel of the Yellow Sea" and 
"Switzerland of the Orient", has grown from a small fishing 
village 100 years ago to today's developed coastal city with a 
centralized port and advantages in tourism, light and textile 
industry, aquaculture, and marine science, its benefits being 
derived from Jiaozhou Bay. With a broad harbor, deep water, 
small waves, and light silt, the excellent natural harbor at 
Jiaozhou Bay is the cradle that gave birth to Qingdao and the 
basis of Qingdao's future prosperity. However, for the past 
several years shrinkage of the water area and water pollution 
have consistently been two major threats to Jiaozhou Bay. 
Although through the efforts of local government and the related 
departments the overall environmental situation in Jiaozhou Bay 
is still acceptable, parts of it and development trends still 
worry people. 
  The sea area has been shrinking over the years and this is 
tending to become increasingly acute. 
  It has now shrunk from 560 km[.sup]2[/] before the 1960's 
to 390 km[.sup]2[/], which is a 30 percent reduction in its 
area from that time. The main cause of this acute reduction is 
man-made as over 10 million tons of all types of garbage are put 
into the sea each year, while large areas of the sea have been 
swallowed up by enclosure of the sea to create land and the 
opening up salt fields and shrimp pools. There is also serious 
water pollution. Because of urban population growth and 
industrial development, 84.67 million tons of industrial waste 
water and 39.28 million tons of household waste water are 
injected into Jiaozhou Bay each year. Furthermore, each year 
more than 2,700 ships enter Jiaozhou Bay which discharge about 
90,000 tons of waste water containing oil. Added to the frequent 
oil leak accidents, the quality of the water has become severely 
polluted. Because of this pollution from a variety of sources, 
the results of monitoring of the water in Jiaozhou Bay show that 
the water area where the water quality has been degraded now 
comprises about 29.29 percent of the total water area. 
  Shrinkage of the water area and water pollution have serious 
outcomes. Shrinkage of the water area inevitably results in 
reductions in the amount of tides and with the reduction in 
tides there is a weakening of the strength of water motion, 
which results in a reduction in replacement of the water body 
and in the silt- carrying capacity. This increases the 
possibility of pollution and silt accumulation in the sea and 
has caused the rate of sedimentation to rise over the years. 
Silt accumulation has also caused a reduction in the water area 
and in the amount of tides. Being repeated in this manner, it 
forms a vicious cycle whose outcome we cannot dare imagine. 
Moreover, greater pollution directly destroys the marine ecology 
and environment and seriously affects the existence of marine 
organisms. In Cangkou Bay, for example, there were 141 species 
of intertidal zone organisms in the 1960's including as many as 
52 species of crustaceans. By the 1970's only 30-odd species of 
organisms including just 12 crustacean species were left. In the 
1980's only 17 species of organisms including four species of 
crustaceans were left. By 1989, only nine species of organisms 
were left. At the same time, the seawater breeding industry, 
harbor piers, military facilities, beach environment, seawater 
bathing beaches, and the ecology and environment were all 
damaged to varying degrees. 
  Because of Jiaozhou Bay's unique status and important 
significance, people have become much more concerned about the 
situation in Jiaozhou Bay and the question of how to develop, 
utilize, and protect Jiaozhou Bay has consistently been a hot 
topic of concern debated by people for many years. The relevant 
experts and scholars have offered many countermeasures and 
suggestion, the main ones being: 
  1) Strengthen propaganda and education, raise people's 
consciousness concerning our maritime territory. Have a correct 
understanding of and scientifically evaluate the environmental 
situation in Jiaozhou Bay, establish the concept of coordinated 
development of the economy with environmental protection and 
moving forward simultaneously. 
  2) Establish a unified and authoritative comprehensive 
development and environmental protection management organization 
for Jiaozhou Bay for unified management of development and 
protection. 
  3) Rely on scientific management and decision-making to form 
an effective marine environmental protection scientific 
decision-making system, strengthen scientific research and 
scientific management of Jiaozhou Bay, creation of shrimp pools 
and salt fields, repair of shoreline walls, construction of 
tidal barriers, linking islands, and other projects should be 
debated before construction can begin. 
  4) Strengthen construction of the legal system, compile at 
Jiaozhou environmental protection and management law as quickly 
as possible, strictly control discharges of pollutants, dumping 
of wastes, oil leaks, and other pollution sources and establish 
legislation for all of them and manage affairs according to the 
law. 
  Being concerned about Jiaozhou Bay is not something based on 
imaginary or groundless fears. Its objective is to arouse a 
sense of urgency among people for protecting Jiaozhou Bay and 
make Jiaozhou Bay healthy and long-lived.

Cairong [7115 1752 2837]: China's Soil Erosion Area Covers Over 
One-Third of Our National Territory, Achievements in Control 
Offset Man-Made Destruction of Vegetation"] 
  [Text] The results of a recent remote sensing survey show 
that China's soil erosion area covers 3.67 million square 
kilometers, equal to 38.2 percent of our national territory. At 
the "People's Republic of China Soil Erosion Law Implementation 
Regulations" press conference held in Beijing on 8 September 
1993, Ministry of Water Resources minister Zhou Wenzhi [0719 
2429 2535] stated with fervor that severe soil erosion is posing 
a threat to our natural environment and national economy. 
  Zhou Wenzhi said that China is losing an estimated five 
billion tons-plus of soil each year, equivalent to 17.5 million 
mu of land cultivated to a depth of one foot. The total amount 
of associated losses of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium 
nutrients far exceed total chemical fertilizer applications in 
China each year. According to incomplete statistics, during the 
past 40 years we have lost 40 million mu of cultivated land due 
to soil erosion, resulting in economic losses of about 10 
billion yuan a year. 
  Zhou Wenzhi pointed out that improvement along with 
destruction is an important cause of degradation of the soil 
erosion situation. He said that since Liberation, it has 
received a high degree of concern from the party and government, 
and through the arduous efforts of vast numbers of cadres and 
the masses, China has controlled an area of soil erosion 
covering more than 500,000 square kilometers and major changes 
have truly occurred in some places. However, at the same time 
man-made destruction of vegetation has caused soil erosion over 
an area covering about 20,000 kilometers each year, which is 
equivalent to the area where soil erosion has been controlled in 
China over the same period, basically offsetting achievements in 
control. As the pace of development and construction has 
accelerated and our population has grown, the rate of 
destruction to soil resources by people has grown at a huge rate 
and the soil erosion situation has worsened. To achieve a 
fundamental reversal of this situation, we must rely on the rule 
of law. 
  Evidently, the newly-promulgated "People's Republic of China 
Soil Erosion Law Implementation Regulations" are important laws 
and regulations matched up with the "Soil Conservation Law" and 
they provide concrete provisions for the core regulations in the 
"Soil Conservation Law" and strengthen their operability.

6513]: "Chengdu Using Microorganisms To Treat Heavy-Metal 
Wastewater"] 
  [Text] Experts in the Chinese Academy of Sciences Biology 
Institute have developed the first successful new method for 
using microorganisms to treat industrial wastewater that 
contains chromium and other heavy metals. In actual use in a 
demonstration project using microorganisms to treat wastewater 
from electroplating at Jingjiang Electric Motor Plant, they have 
obtained excellent results in purifying wastewater and 
recovering heavy metals. Now, this project, which is a project 
to attack key problems in the State Science and Technology 
Commission's Eighth five-Year Plan, has passed examination and 
acceptance by experts in Chengdu directed by the Chinese Academy 
of Sciences. 
  In use, this method mixes selected excellent quality and 
high 
efficiency bacteria with heavy-metal wastewater that absorb 
water like a piece of bread and cause the heavy metals to 
precipitate at the bottom of the tanks. Inspection by 
environmental protection departments indicates that the rate of 
removing heavy metals from wastewater is as high as 99.7 
percent, with a heavy metal recovery rate of more than 80 
percent without causing secondary contamination. The treated 
water completely conforms to the discharge standards stipulated 
by the state.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 7 Jun (AKP) -- Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh, first prime minister of the Royal Government of 
Cambodia, declared he was worried about Cambodia's environment, 
which had been seriously threatened during the past decades. 
  In his speech made on World Environment Day, the head of the 
royal government said he wanted a law on environmental 
protection to be promulgated. 
  "The war, which has lasted for over two decades, has 
destroyed the environment in the country," said Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh. "This," he said, "would plunge Cambodia into the 
abyss of disaster if we (the new generation) did not coordinate 
efforts to fight this crisis." 
  The Cambodian leader recalled that the flood of 1991, 
exceptional for Cambodia, was one of the consequences of 
environmental destruction. 
  The prince wanted severe measures to be taken to protect the 
environment, and he invited Cambodians to follow him in that 
direction. 
  Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh pledged to implement the 
UN environmental program. He thanked international 
organizations for helping to save Cambodia's environment.

    [Editorial Report] Phnom Penh REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA in 
Cambodian on 4 June carries the following reports in its 
business section: 
  Concerning the domestic transportation of timber, the paper 
says that 30 barges carrying processed wood to Phnom Penh have 
been stranded at the Kratie provincial port for nearly a month 
because the province's Department of Forestry and Wildlife has 
refused to issue a permit. No reason has been given. The paper 
calls on the department to explain its action, saying that the 
government has not banned the transportation of processed wood 
for local use and that the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, 
Wildlife, and Fisheries has even taken bids for the exploitation 
of 29 forest lots across the country. Citing the extra fees 
that the timber merchants are forced to pay because of the ban, 
the paper calls on the department to announce future 
transportation bans in advance. 
  In a report on the privatization of state-owned factories, 
the paper says that of the 59 factories put into operation since 
1979, 42 have been rented, 10 have been sold to the local 
private sector and foreign investors, and seven remain under 
government control. The paper cites the director of the Industry 
Ministry's Planning Department as saying that many businessmen 
are interested in renting the remaining seven factories, but are 
hesitant because of the many preconditions and problems. For 
example, they must hire all of the current workers in each 
factory and do not have the right to fire any of them, even if 
they break the rules or refuse to work. Also, they need to 
renovate and modify the factories and the machines -- which are 
not in good condition -- but the import of spare parts is time 
consuming and involves many procedures. 
  On the destruction of Cambodia's forests, the paper blames 
the government for granting logging concessions to foreign 
companies. It says that although a log export ban has been in 
effect since 30 March 1994, many foreign companies are still 
cutting Cambodian trees and transporting logs out of the 
forests. As an example, it cites a joint venture between 
Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore located at Prek Prasap Leu 
village in Prek Prasap District of Kratie Province. The paper 
says the government and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, 
Wildlife, and Fisheries might not know about the activities of 
this company because even the Kratie provincial governor and 
Prek Prasap District governor have pretended not to hear about 
it. About 40,000 cubic meters of logs already cut by this 
company are being transported out of the province. Forestry 
officials have revealed that after the government imposed the 
log export ban, the company stored logs temporarily at Prek 
Phnoeu and is looking for other ways to get the logs out of 
Cambodia. The company plans to export a total of 90,000 cubic 
meters of logs in the 1993-94 period.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Disposing of Waste"] </F>
  [Text] Although it may not have been one of the more 
sensational events of the week, the inauguration on Monday of 
this country's first industrial waste treatment plant surely 
deserves some comment. 
  The truth is that for far too long too many companies in 
Indonesia have been reluctant to seriously consider the problem 
of waste treatment. 
  To address this problem, on the eve of the new plant's 
inauguration, the government issued a regulation requiring all 
manufacturing companies to neutralize their toxic and hazardous 
wastes. In the past, many industries were reported to have 
raised objections to precisely such a requirement on the basis 
of the argument that the process would add too heavily to their 
production costs and make their products less competitive. 
  Of course for companies operating on a small scale, such an 
argument may be true to a certain extent. After all, 
manufacturing firms have to cope with what economists refer to 
as the economy of scale. That is, the bigger the factory and 
its operations, the lighter the cost burden which the 
manufacturer has to bear relative to the volume of goods 
produced. Such an argument, therefore, seems valid, especially 
since small-scale industries comprise an important segment of 
this country's industrial sector. They not only provide a 
service to the society by turning out goods, but also by 
providing jobs to many thousands of people. 
  The significance of the Nambo Village waste treatment plant 
in this particular context is obviously that it helps bring down 
those additional production costs for small-scale enterprises by 
eliminating the need for them to own and operate their own waste 
treatment plants. 
  In the past, even larger industries were reported to have 
used this argument to object to any government regulation that 
would require them to treat their toxic wastes. Surely, 
however, the developments of the last several years have made it 
clear that such a rationale can no longer hold. Under the new 
world order that is now rapidly taking shape, even the trade and 
industrial sectors can no longer act as if they are unaffected 
by the spirit of environmental awareness that is now rapidly 
spreading across the globe. It is in their own interest that 
industrialists respect the principles of environmental soundness 
if they want to compete in the world market. 
  Thus, as President Suharto remarked on the occasion, the 
inauguration of the new U.S.$95 million plant is expected to 
make Indonesia's industrial products more competitive on 
international markets by meeting the criteria of environmental 
"cleanliness" that more and more countries around the world are 
setting for their imports. The new plant, located at Nambo 
Village in Bogor regency, is the first in Indonesia, as well as 
the biggest of its kind so far in Southeast Asia. A second 
plant for the treatment of industrial wastes is now reportedly 
being planned for construction near Surabaya, East Java's 
provincial capital, which has the second-largest concentration 
of industries in Indonesia. Similar plants are also being 
planned for Lhokseumawe in Aceh and for East Kalimantan. 
  Surely, as this country prepares itself for its take-off 
towards self-sustained growth and because the industrialization 
process is bound to accelerate in the years to come, the 
launching of the Nambo Village waste treatment is a laudable, 
albeit small, step towards ensuring that the process of 
development will not impair the sustained health of our 
environment.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jun 6 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Visiting German 
Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Carl-Dieter 
Spranger on Sunday blasted as "unrealistic" the proposed ban on 
the import of tropical wood products and said the ban will 
impede the conservation of tropical forests which serve as the 
lung of the earth. 
  "If the ban on the import of tropical wood products is 
effective, these forest products might give no economic 
advantage to countries which have tropical forests, and that 
they will find it difficult to conserve their forests," Spranger 
told the press at the Sukarno-Hatta airport a moment before he 
left for home. 
  Environmentalists in the United States and Europe have 
proposed that their governments impose a ban on the import of 
tropical wood products from developing countries. 
  Spranger said he had seen for himself Indonesia's 
well-planned efforts to conserve its forests without necessarily 
sacrificing the ecosystem. 
  It was natural for Indonesia which had huge tropical forests 
to utilize its natural resources, including tropical forests, he 
said. 
  Earlier, Forestry Minister Jamaludin Suryohadikusumo briefed 
the German minister on the management of Indonesian tropical 
forests. Spranger also visited tropical forests in East 
Kalimantan during his stay. 
  According to Spranger, the Indonesian Government was 
determined to conserve its tropical forests while exploiting 
part of them to gain foreign exchange earnings. 
  He said he was in support of Indonesia's efforts to 
disseminate objective information on the management of tropical 
forests in developing countries. 
  In 1993, Indonesia exported an estimated nine million cubic 
meters of tropical wood worth U.S.$6.5 billion. Japan was the 
biggest market for Indonesian tropical wood, followed by the 
United States and European countries. 
  Spranger said Germany was prepared to provide the Indonesian 
Government with technical assistance to manage its tropical 
forests.

  [Excerpt] Jakarta -- President Suharto on Monday reminded 
all countries of the need to build treatment centres for 
hazardous and toxic wastes, saying that Indonesia and other 
developing countries do not want to be dumping places of those 
wastes. 
  "The construction of an industrial waste treatment centre 
reflects self-reliance in handling its own hazardous and toxic 
wastes," President Suharto said during the inauguration of the 
industrial waste treatment centre in Cileungsi, south of Jakarta. 
  The waste treatment centre, managed by P.T. [Company 
Limited] 
Prasada Pamunah Limbah Industry, is jointly owned by the 
Bimantara Citra Group, the Waste Management International of 
Britain, and the Environmental Impact Management Agency 
(Bapedal), a government body. 
  The president said the construction of the hazardous waste 
treatment centre also shows that Indonesia is committed to an 
agreement reached during the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, 
Brazil in 1992 on environment-oriented development. 
  He also said that the well-guided management of industrial 
waste would make Indonesian products more competitive at the 
international market on the grounds that many foreign countries 
had issued import regulations and requirements linked to the 
conservation of nature. 
  Attending the ceremony were First Lady Tien Suharto, House 
Speaker Sutejo [name and title as published], State Minister for 
National Development Planning/Head of the National Development 
Planning Board Ginanjar Kartasasmita, and Minister of 
Administrative Reforms T.B. Silalahi. 
  Earlier, State Minister of Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmaja 
reported to the president that as many as 23 companies handed 
over 43 kinds of wastes to the Waste Treatment Centre (PPLI) 
which has the capacity to process some 88,000 tons of waste.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Japan and China formally 
sealed a deal Tuesday [7 June] under which Beijing will provide 
a couple of young Japanese crested ibises for a breeding program 
which hopes to preserve the nearly extinct species in Japan. 
  Chinese Forestry Minister Xu Youfang, who arrived in Japan 
on 
Monday, and Japan's Environment Agency chief Toshiko Hamayotsu 
signed an agreement covering a three-year lending period for the 
rare white birds following talks in the afternoon. 
  The last two Japanese crested ibises remaining in Japan, 
27-year-old Kin and about 20-year-old Midori, are considered too 
old to reproduce -- in human terms they would be over 80 years 
old. 
  China will send the ibis couple in late September to their 
new home at the newly built Sado Ibis Preservation Center in 
Niiho, Niigata Prefecture, which since last autumn has also been 
the home of Kin and Midori, hoping to see the first chicks hatch 
next spring at the earliest. 
  Transport during the breeding period from February to June 
and during the hot summer season could harm the birds, which are 
said to be very sensitive to changes in their habitat. 
  During their first month in Japan, the birds will be looked 
after by four Chinese experts including two feeding specialists, 
who will also train staff at the center in the latest breeding 
methods. 
  China is the only other country in the world where the 
Japanese crested ibis survives. Following the hatching of an 
artificially incubated ibis egg in a Chinese zoo in 1992, a 
world premier, China succeeded in incubating 12 chicks, bringing 
the total ibis population to around 50. 
  Ibises usually breed in March or April laying two to four 
eggs. Under the agreement, China will get the first hatchling, 
while Japan may retain every second ibis chick being born 
through the breeding program. 
  It will be the first time China has loaned a pair of ibises 
to another country. The ibises have not been selected yet, but 
will most likely be inexperienced in reproduction matters 
because so far none of China's ibis couples has had offspring 
naturally. 
  The ibis project took shape when former Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, during his official visit to China 
in March, asked his Chinese counterpart Li Peng for help in the 
preservation of the rare bird. 
  Four breeding attempts by Kin or Midori and a Japanese 
crested ibis from China have failed over the last decade. 
  However, Japanese experts plan to preserve the genes of Kin 
and Midori after their death in a bid to reproduce the birds 
through the use of biotechnology in the future.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- A Chinese environmental 
delegation began meetings Monday [6 Jun] to seek funding from 
Japanese aid agencies and businesses for a four billion dollar 
sustainable development plan for China. 
  China's Agenda 21, developed with the UN Development Program 
(UNDP), contains 64 priority projects and over 500 total 
projects for sustainable and environmentally sound development 
in the next century, said Shi Han, a delegation member. 
  The delegation, led by Shi Jianmin, vice minister of China's 
State Planning Commission, arrived in Japan on Sunday. 
  It is scheduled to meet with several governmental and 
business organizations including the Foreign Ministry, the 
Environmental Protection Agency and the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry. 
  China hopes to use part of the Agenda 21 funds to help make 
its industry more energy-efficient. It also wants to launch a 
clean-coal technology exchange with Japan, Shi said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan will send a group of 
experts on wildlife protection to the Galapagos Islands, 
Ecuador, from Friday to June 27 to help survey damage caused by 
a forest fire, the Foreign Ministry said Monday [30 May]. 
  The government will send six experts through the Japan 
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), in response to a 
request from the Government of Ecuador, the ministry said. 
  The group, comprised of experts on birds, reptiles and 
botanical ecology, will visit Isabela Island, the largest of the 
Galapagos group, to survey the effects on wildlife of the 
prolonged forest fire that has been burning since April 12, it 
said. 
  The experts will also offer advice to Ecuador's presidential 
panel for disaster prevention on measures to protect and 
increase reproduction of wildlife, to repair damage, and on 
monitoring the natural environment, the ministry said. 
  The forest fire on the 460,000-hectare Isabela Island has 
not 
yet been completely extinguished. As of April 26, some 10,000 
hectares had been devastated by the fire, it said. 
  Wildlife peculiar to the Galapagos Islands, such as iguanas 
and giant tortoises, is endangered by the fire. The island's 
ecosystem is also seriously affected, the ministry said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The 1994 white paper on the 
environment approved by the cabinet Tuesday [31 May] endorses 
the introduction of "environment taxes" to transform Japan's 
throwaway society into an economy "less burdensome to the 
environment." 
  Prices should reflect the detrimental effects of production 
processes, products, and services on the environment, while 
investment in environment-friendly "green" businesses must be 
promoted, the Environment Agency's paper suggests. 
  For a successful turnaround of the economic system both, 
producers and consumers have to be involved, it said. 
  Consumers must be educated about an ecological lifestyle 
that 
breaks with the entrenched habits of unrestrained consumerism. 
  The corporate world, too, must be made aware of the business 
opportunities environment technology and eco-oriented industries 
offer as environmental awareness heightens, the paper said. 
  Despite technological progress that has helped to curb 
machine energy consumption, each Japanese consumes more than 
double the world average in primary energy. 
  This is due to large-scale consumption and the never-ending 
quest for a higher and "bigger" living standard, according to 
the paper. 
  Consumers could play an important role in the ecological 
transformation by making choices and buying green products, 
which would eventually force producers to develop more 
environment-friendly products. 
  The paper does not trust the market forces alone and 
recommends introducing taxes that take into account 
environmental costs and to impose charges on ecologically 
harmful products and activities to foster the ecological 
transformation. 
  An environmental tax such as a levy on carbon dioxide 
emissions was under discussion last year, but the basic 
environment law, adopted last November, simply urges the 
government to consider imposing a tax on polluters. 
  The white paper also advocates further expanding deposit 
systems for bottles and other reusable containers. 
  It claims that industrial production could be even extended 
in the latter part of the 21st century without further 
destroying the environment, if investment over the next 50 years 
focuses on antipollution measures and the saving of scarce 
resources. 
  Sewage facilities and other investments in environmental 
protection would also pay off by stimulating the slumping 
economy, the paper says. 
  For an effective ecological overhaul of the economic system, 
which should be laid out in the nation's basic environment 
program currently being worked out, the government should 
consult with industry, civic groups and municipal bodies, the 
paper suggests.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Countries meeting in Paris 
next Monday [6 Jun] to frame a convention to prevent 
desertification are still at odds over how to fund the effort, 
despite an unofficial Canadian-Zambian initiative for a 
compromise proposal, government sources said Thursday. 
  The desertification convention is due to be adopted at a 
fifth intergovernmental negotiating committee meeting June 6-17. 
  But due to continued disagreement between advanced countries 
and developing countries, which have requested the establishment 
of a fund for prevention of desertification, the sources said it 
is likely the treaty will be adopted without a final agreement 
on the funding issue. 
  The convention document is one outcome of the United 
Nations-sponsored Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June, 1992. 
  The document is an action plan to combat desertification, or 
aridity caused by human intervention due to overgrazing or 
excessive cultivation. 
  It calls for technical assistance and funding from advanced 
countries to carry out preventive measures. 
  Estimates put the annual rate of desertification around the 
globe at 60,000 square kilometers in more than 100 countries. 
  Aid from developing countries to combat the trend is 
estimated at 850 million dollars a year. 
  Developing countries want a new funding mechanism and the 
inclusion in the convention of an undertaking reached at a UN 
General Assembly meeting prior to the Earth Summit for developed 
countries to reserve 0.7 percent of their gross national product 
for government official development assistance (ODA). 
  But a number of advanced countries, including the United 
States, have insisted that inclusion of the UN target in the 
convention would justify demands by developing countries for 
increased funding. 
  They have said they have no room to increase their funding 
because of a worldwide depression and are insisting that funding 
is possible if existing forms of ODA are used effectively. 
  Canada and Zambia are behind an unofficial drive to produce 
a 
last-minute compromise draft. 
  Japanese Government officals said developing countries need 
such assistance and tend to accept the view that a new funding 
mechanism should be established with certain conditions attached 
while making the UN target nonbinding. 
  Advanced countries and developing countries have also 
differed over the inclusion in the convention of measures to 
prevent the spread of poverty in African countries in addition 
to those designed to prevent desertification.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held here 
Friday under the sponsorship of the State Environmental 
Commission on the occasion of the world day of environment. 
  At the meeting Yi Sang-nak, vice-chairman of the State 
Environmental Commission, gave a lecture under the title "One 
Globe, One Family." 
  Noting that environmental protection has become an important 
common task facing the mankind in saving it from environmental 
pollution and degradation and making a sustained development, he 
said the developed industrial nations have thrown away a 
fabulous amount of polluting materials, seriously polluting the 
environment of the globe and causing irrevocably grave damage to 
the lives and health of the people. 
  "In our country, the best socialist system of Korean style 
centred on the people has been built and an environmental policy 
for the people has been pursued under the wise guidance of the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, with the result that enormous achievements have been 
registered in environmental protection in the country", he said, 
and continued: 
  "The great leader's idea of environmental protection has 
been 
successfully carried forward by the dear leader. In the days 
when he began leading our revolution, the dear leader expounded 
an original idea that environmental protection is not merely a 
technical and working matter but an important political one for 
improving the people's health and providing them with conditions 
for an independent and creative life, and clearly indicated the 
way of carrying it into practice. 
  "The adoption of `the law of the Democratic People's 
Republic 
of Korea on Environmental Protection' has led to the 
codification of the idea of the great leader and the dear leader 
for environmental protection and the achievements in this 
domain." 
  Referring to the tasks for environmental protection, he 
declared: "We will as ever remain faithful to the international 
obligation for environmental protection by honestly discharging 
the national duty for it." 
  The chief of the United Nations Development Program [UNDP] 
mission also spoke at the meeting. 
  A friendship gathering between officials of the state 
environmental commission and members of the UNDP mission took 
place.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 5 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
observe "World Day of Environment". 
  Noting that mankind is now facing a grave environmental 
problem, an article of NODONG SINMUN says: 
  One billion people live in very polluted air and about 10 
million people die annually from various diseases caused by 
polluted water worldwide. 
  In capitalist countries the monopolies operate polluting 
factories, without taking anti-pollution measure, seriously 
polluting the environment, while pursuing only profits. 
  Continuous nuclear tests and manufacture of nuclear weapons, 
nuclear war exercises let out a large amount of radioactive 
substances, gravely destroying environment. 
  Mankind demands a blue sky and clean water and air. 
  No small number of countries are increasing investments in 
the protection of environment and taking measures for preventing 
pollution. 
  Korea is called a beautiful land with thick forests and 
clean 
water, free from pollution, thanks to the correct policy of the 
Workers' Party of Korea on environmental protection. 
  A MINJU CHOSON article says: 
  The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
is making all efforts to fulfil its national duty for the 
protection of global environment. The Korean people will 
intensify the work for environmental protection together with 
all the world peaceloving people.

  [Text] Seoul, June 4 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China 
selected air pollution, acid rain and waste disposal among their 
six areas of joint research at their first environment 
cooperation talks, the Foreign Ministry said Saturday. 
  They agreed in principle to form a network among 
environmental officials and experts of the two countries and 
named the South Korean Foreign Ministry's International Economic 
Affairs Division and China's National Environment Protection 
Agency International Cooperation Bureau as representatives of 
the network. 
  The six selected research areas include air pollution, acid 
rain, water contamination, waste processing, environment 
projects and city-level environmental planning, the ministry 
said. Chief delegates from the two sides signed a memorandum at 
the end of their two-day meeting agreeing on these points. 
  Seoul and Beijing hope to form a trilateral cooperation 
channel with Japan for regional projects, ministry officials 
said. 
  South Korea and China will hold a second round of 
environment 
cooperation talks in Beijing sometime during the first half of 
next year.

  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- Levels of carbon dioxide 
and methane, blamed for the greenhouse effect, are higher in 
Korea's southwestern Taean peninsula than in China, Mongolia and 
Hawaii, according to a study by Korean scientists. 
  Another study shows that acid rain occurs in rural or remote 
areas like Chongwon, North Chungchong Province, Cheju Island and 
the Taean peninsula -- not as a result of air pollutants from 
Korea but from China. 
  Chong Yong-song, head of the Korea-China Center for 
Atmospheric Research based at the Korea National University of 
Education in Chongwon, and his associate researchers presented 
their observations at the four-day fourth international 
conference on Atmospheric Sciences and Applications to Air 
Quality (ASAAQ) that started Monday at a hotel in southeastern 
Seoul. 
  Their studies, particularly of the Taean peninsula, were 
compared with the results of carbon dioxide and monoxide, and 
methane observations obtained by their counterparts from China, 
Mongolia and Hawaii at Mt. Waliguan, Ulaan Uul and Mauna Loa. 
  Their observations of carbon dioxide levels since November 
1990 show that the Taean peninsula is generally under the 
influence of airflows coming from China. 
  The Korean scientists says their analysis indicates that 
according to methane data from Mongolia and several sites in the 
North Pacific, the Taean peninsula is influenced as much as 31 
PPB (parts per billion) on average by Chinese emissions. 
  In his study on the background-level acidity of 
precipitation 
in Korea, conducted jointly with fellow researcher Kim Tae-kun, 
Chong concludes that annual pH values in rural areas that are 
isolated from major industrial regions are "weak acid" ranging 
between pH 5.0 and 5.3. 
  In Chongwon, a rural area situated in central Korea, 173 
days 
(64 percent) showed acid precipitation out of a total 271 days. 
Higher frequencies of acid precipitation indicate that it is 
spreading out in the rural areas of Korea. 
  Acid rain in rural or remote areas like Cheju Island and the 
Taean peninsula, the scientists say, is carried by rain clouds 
from southern China usually containing high values of acidity. 
  Considering the annual 10-percent rise in energy production 
in China, acid rain is feared to frequently occur in Korea, they 
conclude.

  [Text] Uljin, June 1 (YONHAP) -- Yielding to local 
villagers' protests, the government has retracted a plan to 
build a large radioactive nuclear waste disposal yard here in 
Uljin along the east coast. 
  Uljin County Commissioner Kim Tong-hui met reporters 
Wednesday afternoon to make public Science and Technology 
Minister Kim Si-chung's message containing the retraction. 
  The message read in part, "This is to inform you that 
although some residents of the Uljin area tried to induce a 
radioactive waste management facility, the government has 
decided not to set up such a facility in the Uljin area in 
consideration of various conditions." 
  Meanwhile, large crowds of Uljin people mounted various 
protest actions for the fifth straight day Wednesday against the 
planned creation of a nuclear waste yard. 
  About 1,500 high school students staged a sit-in along a 
major road near Uljin-up beginning around 2 PM while about 200 
shop owners in the Uljin town closed their shops for the day as 
a sign of protest. 
  Around 12 noon, some 1,000 villagers of Puk-myon poured into 
the street and blocked traffic. 
  Of the 12,000 primary and secondary school students in the 
Uljin area, about 10,000 boycotted classes wedensday in a 
protest move.

general border peacekeeping cooperation committee, in his 
interview carried by the 16,298th Saturday issue of the DAILY 
NEWS newspaper on 28 May 1994, the THAILAND TIMES newspaper on 
27 May 1994, and many other Thai newspapers. The colonel 
charged that in the past two months, the Lao People's Army 
sprayed toxic chemicals in water sources and (?lakes) in areas 
along the Thai-Lao border opposite Chiang Kham District in 
Phayao Province, Mae Rim District in Nan Province, and (Bansok) 
Village in Uttaradit Province, killing a large number of animals 
and Lao inhabitants. 
  With regard to this development, the Lao side categorically 
denies such an allegation. The denial was made at the press 
briefing by Brigadier General Douangchai Phisit, member of the 
party Central Committee, deputy chief of the Army General Staff 
Department, and chairman of the Lao-Thai general border 
peacekeeping cooperation committee. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Juan V. Sarmiento Jr.] </F>
  [Text] President Ramos yesterday, lifted the ban on the 
entry of industrial wastes into the country, aggravating fears 
among environmentalists that this would open the floodgates to 
the dumping of toxic wastes here. 
  Mr. Ramos has ordered the Department of Environment and 
Natural Resources and the Bureau of Customs to lift the ban on 
the importation of used plastics and paper wastes as well as 
scrap iron and steel. 
  He also authorized the release of similar shipments which 
have been held by customs authorities. 
  Mr. Ramos said exempting waste materials from the import ban 
would help save dollars for the country and provide local 
industries with cheaper raw materials. 
  "Such exemption is based on the economic impact such as 
potential stoppage of the...industry operations due to 
unavailability of process(ed) materials as well as potential 
loss of foreign exchange," Mr. Ramos said in a memorandum to 
Environment Secretary Angel Alcala and Customs Commissioner 
Guillermo Parayno Jr. [sentence as published] 
  Alcala said plastic scraps are four times cheaper than the 
plastic raw materials and that paper waste would reduce 
dependence on virgin pulp taken from trees. 
  As for the iron and steel industry, Alcala said the local 
supply cannot meet domestic demand of 500,000 metric tons a 
year. The construction industry is the main user of iron and 
steel. 
  Aided by the government's weak monitoring capability, 
traders 
have been shipping toxic wastes to the Philippines. 
  In March, a Greenpeace patrol blocked a Russian-registered 
container ship, Gamzat Tsdasa, delivering 42 tons of toxic 
computer scraps from Australia to Manila. 
  Greenpeace said computer scraps are often contaminated with 
asbestos and other toxic materials. 
  Two months ago, another shipment of 45 containers of "PVC 
scrap," a hazardous waste, from Germany was reported on its way 
to the country. 
  Trade of hazardous waste is banned by the Basel Convention 
on 
the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes. 
  Maximo Kalaw Jr., president of Green Forum Philippines, said 
the importation of hazardous wastes is also prohibited under 
Republic Act 6969, also known as "The Toxic Substances and 
Nuclear Wastes Control Act of 1990." 
  But Greenpeace said the, Philippines has been unable to 
detect and intercept incoming shipments of thousands of tons of 
hazardous wastes, including scrap metal, plastic waste, old 
computers and lead scrap. 
  Greenpeace statistics showed that from 1990 to 1993, a total 
of 64,385 tons waste were shipped to the Philippines from the 
United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. 
  Greenpeace described the Philippines as a "major dumping 
ground of plastic waste" when it allowed entry to shipments of 
18,000 tons of U.S. plastic scrap from 1991 to 1993. 
  The United States shipped 27,226 tons of scrap metal to the 
Philippines in 1990 alone. 
  The United States has admitted dumping toxic battery waste 
to 
the Philippines and other countries.

<F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] Legislator Chao Shao-kang yesterday revealed that, 
over the last nearly 30 years, U.S. company RCA has dumped 
organic waste harmful to human health into self-dug wells near 
its factory, seriously polluting the underground water and soil 
in Taoyuan's Chupei area. To prevent local residents from being 
further harmed by drinking underground water, in addition to 
urging the Environmental Protection Administration [EPA] to 
examine how seriously local soil and underground water have been 
polluted, Chao Shao-kang also hoped the Public Health 
Administration [PHA] would investigate the matter. The following 
is a report by Lin Sung-hua. [Begin recording] 
  Lin: Those living in Taoyuan's Chupei area should 
be aware that the underground water you have been drinking might 
have impaired your health for a long time. On 2 June, 
Legislator Chao Shao-kang revealed that organic waste generated 
from manufacturing electronics products by [words indistinct] 
has been dumped either in the areas near the factory or into 
wells the company dug near the factory, and this might have 
caused harmful effects on local residents over the last nearly 
30 years. Legislator Chao pointed out that the Taiwan U.S. RCA 
Company, whose factory is located in Taoyuan's Chupei area, was 
taken over by General Electric Company in 1986 and was again 
taken over by Thompson Company two years later. When Thompson 
Company purchased the factory, it was worried about pollution 
problems and asked U.S. environmental protection company [name 
indistinct] to take soil and underground water samples from the 
areas near the factory for examination in the United States. 
Results of the examination showed that the soil and underground 
water contained very high concentrations of volatile organic 
substances. Legislator Chao said Thompson Company planned to 
hold a news briefing to explain the pollution caused by General 
Electric. But it was worried that local residents might ask for 
compensation, and so decided to seal off the wells and close 
down the factory. Chao Shao-kang said [sentences indistinct]. 
He said the land where the factory is located has been sold to 
China Electric Company and another company, who knew nothing 
about the pollution problem. Because the land is within the 
Taoyuan urban area, it might be developed into a commercial or 
residential area. To prevent more people from being harmed, 
Legislator Chao decided to expose the fact. He said both 
Thompson and General Electric are well-known companies 
throughout the world and they did pollute Chinese soil. After 
making pollution money for nearly 30 years, they sold the land 
at a profit -- their behavior is quite contemptible. In 
addition to asking the government to sue the two companies at 
the International Court, Legislator Chao also hoped the EPA will 
immediately look into how serious the pollution is. He also 
hoped the PHA will conduct epidemic diseases examination among 
local residents so the government can assist them in demanding 
compensation from the two companies. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on environmental issues monitored through 26 May. 
<H5>  Bolivia </H5>
  The Bolivian Forum on Environment and Development, Fobomade, 
charged that the indiscriminate cutting of trees such as the 
mara, oak, and other species makes them increasingly close to 
extinction in the Terevinto and Ayacucho cantons, adjacent to 
Amboro National Park, Santa Cruz Department. Fobomade Secretary 
General Loida Rodriguez said this situation is reflected in the 
increasing transportation of trees to various markets. (La Paz 
PRESENCIA in Spanish 14 May 94 p 6) 
  Alternative Development Under Secretary Raul Enrique Ugalde 
Castro stated that the Chapare region could disappear in 10 
years because of deforestation and pollution, and that "urgent 
measures must be adopted to avoid this disaster." He said the 
"worrisome" exploitation of forests has reached an "alarmingly" 
irrational level. He noted that another "serious" problem is the 
pollution of rivers and the area as a whole. He said: "Coca 
maceration pits have contaminated everything," and that a study 
shows that 50 percent of the fish in Chapare are no longer 
fertile. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 18 May 94 p 1) 
  Paraguayan Ambassador to Bolivia Julia Velilla agreed that 
the Pilcomayo River is becoming a sewer due to the mineral waste 
spilled into it from dozens of mines. (La Paz Radio Fides in 
Spanish 1100 GMT 24 May 94) 
<H5>  Brazil </H5>
  On 15 May, 2.5 million of liters of oil spilled from a 
pipeline linking the Almirante Barroso terminal with the 
Presidente Bernardes refinery in Cubatao. The oil already has 
affected the Parequecaba, Guaica, Cigarra beaches in Sao 
Sebastiao and the Clube and Saco da Capela beaches in Santos, 
Sao Paulo State. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2340 
GMT 19 May 94) 
  Approximately 10 metric tons of oil spilled from a truck 
owned by the Transomega Transportadora company that was parked 
in the company compound in Santos' Estuario neighborhood. The 
oil leaked into Channel 5 through rainwater pipes. Efforts are 
being made to prevent it from reaching the beaches. (Sao Paulo 
AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2340 GMT 19 May 94) 
  Air pollution has doubled in Sao Jose dos Campos. Lycia 
Maria 
Moreira Nordemann, National Institute of Space Research expert, 
reported that 85 micrograms per cubic meter of particles were 
detected in the air in 1993 compared with 1992 when it was 42 
micrograms. She said that on 9-13 August 1993 the average air 
pollution was 190 micrograms per cubic meter. She added that 
only 25 percent of the air pollution is caused by local 
industry, and 75 percent by other regions of Sao Paulo. She 
noted that rainwater is registering very high acidity levels.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Amiram Kohen] </F>
  [Text] "If the salinization and pollution of the coastal 
aquifer continues at the present rate, the level of water 
salinity and pollution will by the year 2018 be such as to 
render 25 percent of the aquifer water impotable, while the 
salinity rate of over 50 percent of the water will be above the 
maximum recommended level." This is one of the findings of a 
report prepared by the Water Commission's Hydrological Service, 
due to be submitted to the Knesset's State Audit Committee today. 
  The coastal aquifer is Israel's largest reservoir containing 
about 400 million cubic meters of water -- about one-fifth of 
the entire water quantity produced annually in Israel. In 
recent years, annual pumping from that reservoir stood at some 
360 million cubic meters. The anticipated deterioration is the 
result of a rising nitrate concentration and from the 
salinization rate. 
  The report indicates that the coastal aquifer has been 
undergoing gradual salinization, and even today, about one-tenth 
of the water pumped from the reservoir (about 32 million cubic 
meters) comes from drillings ("cells") whose salinity rate 
exceeds 250 milligrams of chlorine to a liter, which is the 
maximum recommended by official standards. 
  The coastal aquifer's rate of increase of nitrates 
concentration is about one milligram to a liter per year. Any 
nitrate concentration exceeding 90 milligrams to a liter 
disqualifies the water immediately, because it causes cyanosis 
in babies. 
  The report shows that even today, about one-fifth of the 
entire quantity of water pumped from the aquifer (about 64 
million cubic meters) is produced from wells whose water has a 
nitrate concentration above the allowable norm, while about 60 
percent of the water is pumped from drillings which have 
exceeded the recommended maximum of 45 milligrams per liter. 
  The report notes that the pollution rate is liable to be 
much 
more rapid because the estimates do not account for future 
changes in groundwater quality.

  [Text] Water Commissioner Gid'on Tzur says that autonomy 
agreements could critically endanger Israel's water supply. In 
a briefing to the Knesset State Audit Committee, the 
commissioner said the country's water supply could be damaged by 
seeping sewage and industrial waste from the autonomous regions. 
He said he believes that Israel should have secured better 
guarantees for its water rights during negotiations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Division of the Black Sea Fleet: </F>
"Who Owes Whom?"] 
  [Text] According to the data of expert analyses performed 
by specialists of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the 
Main Ecological Inspection, and the corresponding services of 
the Crimean Republic and the city of Sevastopol in the framework 
of the fulfillment of Section II of Presidential Directive 
No.110/93 of 11 October 1993, total losses from possible 
economic consequences due to the presence of the Russian 
Federation's Black Sea Fleet on the territory of Ukraine will 
constitute 53 million karbovantsi a year. Every day, the sewage 
discharged, without purification, from the fleet's boats into 
the Sevastopol Bay alone amounts to 1,000 cubic meters. 
  The Black Sea Fleet fuel storage (Military Unit 62709) is 
the 
main polluter of the Sevastopol Bay with petroleum products. 
Subsurface water, soil, and the sea bottom have been polluted. 
Today, the Sevastopol Bay is practically dead. It must be 
cleared of metal scrap: About 30 ships, as well as munitions, 
spare parts, and so on lie on the bottom. One-third of all the 
land occupied by the Black Sea Fleet bases needs to be 
recultivated. There are four million cubic meters of 
contaminated subsurface waters. According to tentative expert 
estimates by specialists of the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection, the cost of the elimination of the harm inflicted on 
the environment as a result of the activity of the Black Sea 
Fleet units and facilities in the Sevastopol Bay constitutes 
$3.432 million, and the total cost for all places where the 
Black Sea Fleet is stationed on the territory of Ukraine is 
$17.160 million. 
  Yet another round of negotiations on the division of the 
Black Sea Fleet has ended without any results. The Russian side 
continues to insist on getting the shore structure of the Black 
Sea Fleet. The cost of the entire fleet is estimated at between 
$5 billion and $6 billion, whereas the ecological aspect of the 
problem is not even put on the agenda. Well, who must pay whom?

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Kirichenko and Azer Mursaliyev under the </F>
heading "History": "Embargo on the Amu Darya"] 
  [Text] In a situation in which economic wars, energy 
embargoes and blackmail are becoming virtually commonplace and a 
daily occurrence throughout the entire post-Soviet space, it is 
quite clear that water is also acquiring significance as a 
strategic raw material. And it is unlikely that various 
political forces will not want to take advantage of that fact. 
Especially since water wars are not uncommon in the history of 
Central Asia. 
  In the hot summer of 1850 a unit set out from Khiva in the 
direction of Staryy Urgench: Khiva's ruler, Mukhammed-Emin, had 
ordered the construction of a dam on the Sharkrauk. The Turkmen 
tribes that paid the khan a "blood tribute" by sending their 
young men to serve in his forces had rebelled. And 
Mukhammed-Emin decided to put down the revolt by depriving the 
"yomut bandits" of water. Dams were erected 
everywhere to cut the yomuts off from the water of 
the Amu Darya. 
  The yomuts took up arms. But the "water embargo" 
proved a powerful weapon. The yomuts were defeated 
and sued for peace. And in 1869 the khan allowed water to be 
released from the Amu Darya to the Turkmen lands through the 
Laudan Canal. 
  Yet a much more bitter and more protracted "water war" 
occurred in the region after the arrival of Russia and the 
massive introduction of cotton cultivation. 
  The 1920's. The Fergana Valley lies in smoke and blood. Red 
Army units are hunting down Basmaki units. A unit of Umar Ali's 
irregulars bursts into a village in Margilanskiy Rayon in the 
middle of the planting season. To punish the peasants for 
planting cotton the guerrillas cut down 54 people, and the rest 
were told that if they planted cotton again "a holy mound would 
be built with the villagers' heads." Umar Ali's "anti-cotton" 
sentiments were not the exception, but more likely the rule 
among the Basmaki. 
  Incidentally, the fight over cotton in Central Asia began 
before the Bolsheviks arrived. Prior to the revolution virtually 
all uprisings in Central Asia were preceded by peasants' refusal 
to plant cotton. Just as soon as the fields were sown with 
traditional crops alarmed czarist officials sent off secret 
dispatches to the capital. These were followed by the arrival of 
punitive forces... 
  It is a well-known fact that the Basmaki lost. For many 
years 
cotton was the deciding factor in the life of Soviet Central 
Asia, becoming a monoculture. 
  The region's ecological system has simply not been able to 
withstand the pressure of this monoculture. It is interesting to 
note that the traditional irrigation system of Central Asia, 
which according to scientists took shape in approximately the 
middle of the first millennium B.C.E., existed virtually without 
significant change for more than two millennia.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Kirichenko and Azer Mursaliyev under the </F>
heading "Situation": "Water Wars"] 
  [Text] If you enter the Uzbekistan Ministry of Water 
Resources building, go up a marble staircase and flip a switch, 
you will see an electric "river" flow from the Ob River into the 
Central Asian deserts. This "Diagram Map of Ob-Irtysh Water 
System Diversion to Central Asia" was built in the 1980's, and 
apparently built to last. 
  A curious metamorphosis: it seemed that the plan to divert 
northern rivers had finally been buried almost 10 years ago. 
Outraged articles in NOVYY MIR and the closing of the 
intelligentsia's ranks against changing the course of rivers 
proved the obvious to everyone: decisions on super-projects, no 
matter how alluring they might seem, are most often made without 
consideration for the long-range effects of introducing the 
particular boon of civilization in question, whether it be the 
greening of the Sahara or a dike across the Bering Strait... 
  The USSR Ministry of Water Resources was shut down with 
great 
pomp. 
  Yet just as soon as the passions accompanying the turbulent 
breakup of the former union republics had died down a bit, new 
sprouts of old ideas once again struggled toward the light. 
<H5>  They Prefer To Discuss the Aral Sea in a Whisper </H5>
  In the East, power is a matter of who owns the water, not 
the 
land. It is this simple idea that is demonstrated over and over 
at every historical juncture. Following that idea, Central Asia 
has already lost its struggle for power. 
  At one time it was supposedly concern for the region's 
socioeconomic development that justified the decision to carry 
out large-scale irrigation in Central Asia. Behind the slogans 
lay much simpler ambitions: the desire to earn huge amounts of 
money that were then successfully invested not in canal linings, 
but instead in individuals' own dachas and estates. 
  In the late 1950's, when the water balance was still being 
maintained, 64 cubic kilometers of water flowed into the Aral 
Sea each year, with 63 cubic kilometers of that subsequently 
evaporating. By 1980, as the result of the development of 
irrigation-based agriculture and increasing irretrievable water 
consumption, the water flow had fallen to 11 cubic kilometers. 
In 1985-86 not a single drop of water flowed into the sea. 
  In Uzbekistan alone canals extend 183,000 km. According to 
calculations done by Academician Aleksandr Yanshin, only 
two-three percent of those canals are reinforced and lined with 
concrete or other binders. That means that water is literally 
draining away into the sand. Experiments have proven that it 
only takes seven-10 cubic meters of water to irrigate one 
hectare of farmland, yet two or three times that much is 
currently being used. 
  The "third Central Asian river," the river of poor 
management 
and irrepressible ambitions, has created swamps and four million 
hectares of salinated, uninhabitable land that has been given a 
name that evokes nearby deserts: the Aralkum. 
  On its way to the Aral Sea the Amu Darya is quite simply 
drained to its very riverbed. Despite what geography textbooks 
say, it has long since ceased to flow into the sea or, more 
precisely, what was once called a sea. Just as the Zeravshan 
River no longer flows into the Amu Darya. 
  The highest rate of infant mortality rate in the world is 
found in the Aral region, at 80 per 1,000 newborns. The summers 
have gotten hotter, there are 90 days of dust storms every year, 
and winters are colder -- not just in Central Asia, but also 
along the lower Volga, in the southern Urals, in Western 
Siberia, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan... 
  In Uzbekistan I heard it said several time that "the death 
of 
the Aral Sea is an accomplished fact." The universal cries of 
"The Aral Sea can still be saved!" are supposedly misleading 
people, even though now is the time we should be urgently 
working on another problem that can still be solved: the problem 
of lands that must be saved from the "heavy breath" of the dying 
Aral Sea. But no one was willing to say that into a microphone 
-- just in private, and then only in a whisper. 
  My trip to Uzbekistan coincided with severe high water 
levels, the thawing of mountain snows, and the inundation of 
areas adjoining rivers. I just could not understand how 
Uzbekistan could have a water shortage. Hydroelectric power 
station managers begged the Ministry of Water Resources to 
permit controlled discharges from overfilled reservoirs: if the 
water were released evenly, on several different occasions, then 
flooding could be avoided. But the Ministry of Water Resources 
had its own opinion about that, or rather it had its approved 
plans, which nature somehow never seems to take into account. 
  All rivers have a planned flow capacity. The Chirchik, for 
instance, can carry 1,000 cubic meters per second. But therein 
lies the rub: even if actually carrying only 700 cubic meters it 
floods all the adjoining dachas, roads and even enterprises such 
as the Tashkent Motor Plant. 
  If everyone is aware of these facts, then why is the problem 
of the Aral Sea portrayed as unsolvable? It would seem that what 
needs to be done is to reinforce the sides of canals, prevent 
water from running off into low-lying areas and lakes, regulate 
the watering schedule and, finally, follow long-standing cotton 
cultivation technologies that make it possible to avoid several 
unnecessary waterings... 
  It turns out that this is not the solution. In order to save 
a single cubic kilometer of water it would be necessary to pay 
(in Soviet prices) R2.5 billion [rubles]. It is perhaps for that 
reason that water resource managers are still obsessed with 
completely different projects. 
<H5>  The Most Cherished Dream of the Karakum </H5>
  My interview with Georgiy Balayanets, chief expert with 
Uzbekistan's Main Administration for Water Resource Monitoring, 
was almost over when my interlocutor (up until that point very 
cautious in his assertions and assessments) stood up and, going 
over to a huge map of Central Asia, suddenly remarked: "The 
entire region's most cherished dream has been and remains the 
diversion of the Ob-Irtysh water system. Including for the 
purpose of saving the Aral Sea." 
  The Aral Sea was long ago entered in Uzbekistan's balance 
sheet as the price that had to be paid for "cotton 
independence," and it was said that this was just something that 
had to be accepted. Now people are reckoning which is cheaper: 
to conserve their own water or bring in "outside sources"? 
  A canal 2,320 km long, the brainchild of the Soviet Ministry 
of Water Resources, was assigned the glorious mission of saving 
the Aral Sea from death and solving the problems of a rapidly 
growing region (incidentally, it was the demographic 
justification that was promoted as primary). It was assumed that 
with the aid of Siberian rivers it would be possible to find 
timely ways to provide food, employment and a positive 
environmental situation for future residents of Central Asia and 
Kazakhstan. 
  Work was done on this project by more than 100 union-level 
institutes, and the canal-digging machinery had already been 
purchased. On a human level one can sympathize with the 
planners, who spent years of their labor designing unique 
engineering projects. But did anyone ever stop to think about 
the kind of future awaiting the areas that were to be developed 
in the process of the canal building? 
  "It was proposed that 25 cubic kilometers of water be 
diverted to the south each year," says Academician Yanshin. "But 
that amount would not even be sufficient to maintain the Aral 
Sea's current level! Nevertheless they wrote that the water 
diversion would increase total agricultural yield by two-three 
percent in comparison to the `Food Program'. Meanwhile, more 
than 20 percent of the crop is being lost during harvesting, 
transportation and storage -- these are the untapped resources 
that could be going into water conservation and infrastructure 
development. And has anyone ever calculated how much it will 
cost just to operate the canal?" 
  But it appears there is no point in answering even these 
obvious questions, because Russia does not have the money to 
revive the river diversion project, and the prospects of the 
Central Asian countries and Kazakhstan doing so are even dimmer. 
  According to our information, in the early 1990's some 
Central Asian states placed this condition before the Soviet 
Government: they would sign the Union Treaty only if the 
northern river diversion project were revived. It appears they 
even got approval for that... But the Soviet Union collapsed, 
and the issue went away on its own. 
  Today the water problems of Central Asia and Kazakhstan are 
exacerbated by "feudal fragmentation." Everyone is his own boss. 
In the opinion of Aleksandr Yanshin, Kazakhstan's Lake Balkhash 
has been spared precisely because the lake does not have several 
owners, each prepared to take as much as they like and more than 
likely leave their neighbors without... 
  At the Ministry of Water Resources I was told in strictest 
secrecy about another astounding project developed by 
Uzbekistan's water resource managers. For several kilometers the 
Amu Darya flows along the border between fraternal Turkmenistan 
and Uzbekistan. So why not shift the river's channel to Uzbek 
territory? Never mind that it would take more than a hundred 
pumping stations to divert the water to a new channel. 
  Incidentally, the Ukrainians, within whose territory 
Russian-owned gas pipelines are located, have already figured 
out ways to attach taps to them and siphon off fuel. Just 
imagine what would happen to a river from which one could draw 
as much water as one wanted without having to resort to any 
tricks... 
  Relations with Afghanistan are a separate issue. Right now a 
war is being fought "beyond the river," and water consumption 
there does not exceed three cubic km. But as soon as hostilities 
are over at least three times that much water will be needed. 
<H5>  When the Indus Flows to Central Asia... </H5>
  But there is no plan to compare with an idea put forward by 
Nadzhim Khamrayev, director of the Institute for Water Problems, 
a division of the Uzbekistan Academy of Sciences. In his 
opinion, the "issue of water diversion is only tangentially 
related to the issue of saving the Aral Sea," no more than that. 
The most important thing is how to feed a growing population. 
How? Uzbek water specialists cannot stop thinking about the huge 
and, most importantly, unutilized water resources in the Indus 
River -- 220 billion cubic meters. Currently the institute 
headed by Khamrayev is promoting the idea of diverting a portion 
of the flow of rivers that rise in the Pamir-Tyanshan mountain 
range. This plan includes not only the Central Asian countries, 
but also Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and even India. 
  In the pages of the respectable Tashkent newspaper 
BIZNES-VESTNIK VOSTOKA the academician describes in detail three 
alternatives for diverting water from the Indus River to Central 
Asia. The first two options are technically complex, requiring 
the building of tunnels through mountains. But the third is 
supposedly deserving of "the greatest attention." The plan is to 
raise the water flow by 600-700 meters not far from the 
Pakistani port of Karachi, from which the water will flow by 
force of gravity across Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. At the 
Afghan-Turkmen border the water of the Indus would flow into the 
Amu Darya. 
  The proposed distance: 2,600 kilometers! Then we would have 
flowering gardens like the gardens of Semiramis, and heavenly 
groves of trees. The only thing not indicated is how much all 
this could cost and where the money will come from. Not to 
mention the political interests of the states involved in this 
"project"... 
<H5>  How About a Water Tax? </H5>
  Academician Khamrayev never ceases to remind us that the 
solution to the water problems of Uzbekistan and all of Central 
Asia is not up to local governments, but rather Russia. It would 
be impossible to divert the Ob-Irtysh system without the consent 
of the Russian Federation. Just as it is impossible to resolve a 
single dispute involving water within Central Asia itself. It 
was toward this end that the Interstate Water Management Council 
and the International Fund To Save the Aral Sea were 
established, with Russia participating as an observer. 
  Let us examine the "Decision by the Central Asian Heads of 
State To Establish Funding for the `International Fund To Save 
the Aral Sea'," which was adopted in Nukus in January and signed 
on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation by Yuriy 
Yarov. At first glance a quite unremarkable decision that merely 
states an intention and essentially decides nothing. The four 
Central Asian states and Kazakhstan pledge to pay up to one 
percent of their state budgets into a joint "water" fund. But 
thus far not a single sum-kupon, manat or tenge has been 
deposited in it. Kazakhstan's water managers have announced that 
they will go their own way altogether. 
  Back in the days of the USSR, Central Asia repeatedly 
returned to the idea of instituting a water tax, something that 
has been practiced since ancient times. Now this idea is making 
the rounds again. But today it would be even more difficult to 
implement. Now that each area is independent one can imagine the 
kind of money that Tajikistan, which is at war and essentially 
not working, or even Kyrgyzstan, might demand in payment for 
water from Uzbekistan, for example. Uzbekistan's annual water 
consumption is 115 cubic km, 105 of them flowing out of 
neighboring mountains. 
  The World Bank has also gotten involved in saving the Aral 
Sea, but only one condition: that the "Decision..." be 
immediately amended to exclude Point 8, which mandates (albeit 
in a very cautious and Eastern way) "the implementation of a 
compilation of technical and economic studies pertaining to the 
issued of donor augmentation of rivers in the Aral Sea basin 
from external sources." 
  The World Bank was deferred to and the point dropped. But 
for 
how long?

"Possible Consequences of River Diversion Projects"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Northern Diversion Regions </H5>
  1. Flooding of farmland and timber land by reservoirs; 
rising 
ground water levels. 
  2. Damage to the fishing industry due to changes in the 
hydrobiological conditions of rivers. 
  3. Changes in the permafrost layer (primarily in Siberia). 
  4. Archaeological, historical and cultural damage as a 
result 
of construction and flooding (primarily in the northern European 
section). 
  5. Disruption of traditional ways of life and cultures due 
to 
the influx of tens of thousands of construction workers into 
sparsely populated areas. 
  6. Climatic changes along the shores of large reservoirs. 
  7. Changes in ice coverage and climate at the mouths of 
major 
Arctic rivers (due to reduction in water volume and thermal flow 
and changes in the river discharge schedule). 
<H5>  Southern Diversion Regions </H5>
  1. Possible introduction of harmful aquatic species and 
diseases as a result of the merger of northern and southern 
watersheds. 
<H5>  Effects on an International Scale </H5>
  1. Degradation of certain fish species of international 
significance (for example, the Atlantic salmon). 
  2. Effects of European water diversion on the hydrological, 
saline and biological condition of the Caspian Sea will affect 
Iran. 
  3. The tremendous amounts of diversion (200-300 cubic km 
annually) from rivers in the Arctic Sea basin that are possible 
by the next century could cause changes in permanent Arctic Sea 
ice cover (particularly in the Karsk Sea) sufficient to cause 
climate changes extending beyond the borders of the CIS.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Kirichenko and Azer Mursaliyev under the </F>
heading "Projection": "A Gas Embargo Will Seem Like Nothing: The 
Environmental Undercurrent of the Military and Political 
Situation in Central Asia"] 
  [Text] Most dependent on external water resources is 
Uzbekistan, whose economy is almost completely dominated by a 
single crop: cotton. It is that monoculture that actually got 
the country "hooked" on the "water habit." Though it won "cotton 
independence" for the whole country, Uzbekistan itself fell into 
"cotton dependency." It is hardly likely that it will be able to 
get rid of it any time in the coming decades, as the peasants of 
Turkmenistan attempted to do in 1916 by refusing to plant cotton 
and going back to farming traditional crops. Over the years of 
its uncontested dominance, cotton monoculture has brought about 
significant changes in the very structure of society and even in 
people's way of thinking. Too many things in this republic, from 
agricultural to industry to politics, are connected with cotton. 
And the phrase "a monoculture requires a monogovernment" also 
works in the other direction. 
  The rivers that bring water to Uzbekistan originate in three 
neighboring countries: Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan. 
Today all these are much more dependent on Tashkent than 
Tashkent is on them. It is through Uzbekistan's territory that 
vitally important lines of communication to Kyrgyzstan, 
Tajikistan and the northern part of Afghanistan pass, and it is 
from there that they get the majority of the energy resources 
they consume. This in turn allows Tashkent to exert a certain 
amount of pressure on them. Yet theoretically these countries 
could put the neighboring giant in a much more dependent 
position. And they could do it the same way the khan of Khiva 
once did against the rebellious Turkmen: by building dams across 
the canals that flowed to their lands. Or the same way that 
Turkey is doing at this very moment as it carries out a 
grandiose irrigation project in southeastern Anatolia. By 
building a network of dams and hydroelectric power stations on 
the upper reaches of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers and 
creating a chain of reservoirs in that region, Ankara now has a 
fairly powerful tool for exerting pressure on its southern 
neighbors -- Iraq and Syria -- and is now planning to export a 
new kind of raw material: water for the arid Persian Gulf 
countries and Saudi Arabia. 
  Uzbekistan's southern neighbors could utilize their water 
resources in precisely the same way. If that were the case, 
Tashkent could find itself in a situation in which Russia's "gas 
embargo" against Ukraine might seem like nothing by comparison. 
That fact is objectively transforming Uzbekistan's southern 
"near abroad" into a zone of strategic interests. And it is 
urgently forcing and will continue to force the government in 
Tashkent to pursue an active policy in the region to prevent the 
emergence there of hostile regimes that might be tempted to step 
on Uzbekistan's water lifeline. 
  Incidentally, it is precisely in that region and in that 
manner that the Tashkent government is operating as it maintains 
close contacts with Gen. Abdulrashid Dustum, the de facto ruler 
of northern Afghanistan, who has blocked attempts by the Tajik 
opposition to regain power. For fairness' sake it should be 
noted that even before the start of the civil war, in which 
Uzbekistan has intervened in various ways, the Tajik opposition 
held views that were, to put it mildly, definitely not friendly 
toward Tashkent or President Islam Karimov. This in turn made 
Uzbekistan's support for their opponents in the Tajik civil war 
quite logical. 
  However, the political situation in this complex region does 
not depend solely on the presence of Uzbekistan. And in view of 
that the presence of Russian troops and border guards in 
Tajikistan and its retention in the ruble zone, on the one hand, 
and persistent efforts to gain control over major Tajik and 
Kyrgyzstan hydroelectric power stations, on the other, appear in 
a completely different light, and not one favorable to 
Uzbekistan.

  [Text] Tamara Zlotnikova, deputy chairman of the Russian 
State Duma Committee for Ecology, has yet again urged the 
president to intervene personally in the state's ecological 
policy. "For the first time men's life expectancy has dropped 
below pension age, deformed children are being born, and 
Russians are on the threshold of irreversible changes beyond 
which the collapse of the state and the death of the peoples are 
possible," Zlotnikova wrote in her letter to Yeltsin. 
  Less than 0.6 percent of the expenditure section of the 
budget, or 0.15 percent of the gross domestic product, is 
earmarked for ecological programs. That has never happened in a 
single civilized or even not very civilized country, although 
the troubled and in places catastrophic nature of the ecological 
situation is obliging people to increase financing for 
environmental conservation at least to some extent. According 
to some figures, the ecological damage throughout the country in 
1993 totaled 15 trillion rubles, and this year it is forecast at 
43 trillion, which is over 40 times the expenditure envisaged on 
ecology in the budget.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Vladimir Taranov] 
  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Any steps taken by any country 
of the Caspian Sea Basin with a view to get an advantage in 
terms of the sea's natural resources are at variance with the 
interests of the rest of the countries of the Caspian region. 
  This is how Grigoriy Karasin, spokesman for the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, answered to a question concerning memorandum 
on cooperation in the field of power engineering, which Britain 
and Azerbaijan signed earlier, at a Moscow briefing on Thursday. 
  According to Karasin, the memorandum provides for holding 
talks for the purpose of working out agreements on cooperation 
in the field of prospecting for and extracting gas and oil in 
various areas including the so-called Azeri sector of the 
Caspian Sea. 
  After the memorandum was signed, the Russian Foreign 
Ministry 
handed in a note to the British embassy, Karasin said. 
  According to him, Russia pointed out in the note that the 
bottom of the Caspian sea is not divided into sectors, because 
the sea is by nature a sole reservoir with a united ecological 
system and represents an object for a joint use. Therefore, all 
the countries of the Caspian Sea region must be involved in 
making decisions with regard of all activities, including 
development, prospecting for and making use of the relevant 
natural resources.

<F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report: "Taiwan Offers Nuclear Waste to </F>
Moscow" -- last two paragraphs are IZVESTIYA conclusion] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- A fresh piece of news has arrived from the 
prosperous island of Taiwan -- Taiwan-Russian business contacts 
are threatening to take a major new direction provided the sides 
agree a price. It is a question of Taiwan's nuclear waste being 
stored on Russian territory for cash. 
  Chan Chunchen [name as transliterated], director of the 
Taiwan Power state corporation, on his return to Taipei after a 
12-day tour of Russia, Sweden, and Norway, told reporters that 
fruitful talks had begun regarding the handling of Taiwan's 
nuclear waste in Russia. According to Chan, his partners in the 
talks were representatives of a certain research center who have 
10 nuclear dumps on Russian territory under their jurisdiction. 
It is at these "capacities" that it is intended to process and 
store Taiwan's highly toxic waste products, provided of course 
that the financial side of the project is agreed to their mutual 
satisfaction. 
  The problem of nuclear waste from its nuclear power stations 
is an extremely pressing one for Taiwan. It is not only a 
question of vigorous protests from the population (during a 
recent antinuclear demonstration in Taipei, for instance, over 
10,000 people came out onto the streets) but of the fact that 
the dumps are almost full to bursting. The largest "waste 
facility" on the island of orchids, for instance, will have to 
be closed next year, but Taiwan's three nuclear stations 
punctually produce 130 tonnes of radioactive waste every year 
and that has to be put somewhere. 
  Taipei has examined several options for resolving this 
problem or, to be more precise, several locations to which toxic 
waste could be sent -- in particular there was a plan to 
organize storage in "greater" China and in Sweden. However 
Beijing did not respond to Formosa's alluring proposition. The 
Swedes resolutely refused. Then along came Russia -- Taipei 
calculated that Russia's boundless expanses and its need for 
money should incline it to enter into constructive dialogue on 
this tricky topic. As you can see, their assumptions paid off 
-- that is the conclusion at least that can be drawn from the 
brief report made by the head of the Taiwan power corporation on 
his work in Russia. 
  IZVESTIYA was told by the Ministry for Atomic Energy that 
there have been no talks regarding the possibility of burying 
Taiwan's nuclear waste in Russia. According to a senior 
ministry official, the Taiwanese tried to sound out the Russian 
side on this score during a recent scientific and practical 
conference on nuclear technologies in St. Petersburg. They were 
told that in accordance with current law and the president's 
edict Russia does not accept foreign states' nuclear waste for 
storage. Storage of spent fuel from nuclear power stations 
built abroad with Russian assistance is carried out on the basis 
of special agreements. 
  However the ministry official voiced the opinion that a deal 
with Taiwan could bring colossal profits and would enable Russia 
to resolve many of its economic problems.

<F P=106> [Tatyana Smolyakova report: "Ecology: "Patches for the </F>
Submarine"] 
  [Text] In accordance with a presidential directive and a 
Russian Federation Government decree a routine expedition to the 
area where the Komsomolets nuclear submarine sank five years ago 
in the Norwegian Sea will go ahead 15 June through 15 August. 
The voyage is to be carried out under the direction of Russia's 
Ministry for Emergency Situations with the participation of a 
number of Russian Academy of Sciences research institutes, the 
"Rubin" maritime technology central design bureau, and the 
Defense Ministry. 
  We would remind you that there are an atomic reactor and two 
torpedoes with nuclear warheads aboard the submarine. The 
torpedoes pose the greatest potential danger: Each of them 
contains 3,200 grams of plutonium-239. Since the nose section 
of the submarine has been damaged seabed currents could destroy 
the torpedoes' casings. And then radioactive contamination of 
the water is inevitable. According to the most pessimistic 
estimates, this could happen in late-1995 or early-1996. And 
although most scientists and specialists do not share such a 
pessimistic forecast, they all agree that it is better to play 
safe. That is the purpose of the expedition. 
  There are three specific tasks -- to hermetically seal the 
nose section of the Komsomolets nuclear submarine using special 
titanium "patches," monitor the radiation and environmental 
situation in the area, investigate the technical state of the 
submarine, and search for the rescue chamber. 
  A collegium session was held at the Ministry for Emergency 
Situations to examine the preparations for the expedition. It 
was acknowledged that the work is proceeding on schedule. The 
titanium "patches" have already been brought aboard the 
oceanographic ship Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. The intention is 
to fit them to the submarine using manned "Mir" underwater craft 
equipped with mechanical arms. In mid-June the ship will leave 
Kaliningrad, go to St. Petersburg and then to Denmark and 
Norway, and start the actual scientific program 1 July in the 
area of the wreck of the Komsomolets. The preparation of a 
warship to ship freight and members of the expedition from 
Murmansk to the work area is being completed. Another 
oceanographic vessel has been chartered in Murmansk as backup 
for the operation. 
  During the coming voyage particular attention will be paid 
to 
environmental monitoring. Unique self-contained equipment will 
be set up in the area where the submarine sank from which 
readings can be taken regarding the state of the environment 
without the equipment's being removed from the water. This is 
extremely important in order to gain a precise knowledge of the 
situation and precisely forecast how it will develop. 
  The fact that hitherto monitoring has been by no means 
perfect has given rise to a mass of speculation over the problem 
of the Komsomolets. For instance, there has been plenty of 
supposition that the fishing catch may be contaminated as a 
result of a plutonium leak. 
  In theory that possibility is not ruled out. It is known 
that the plankton on which the fish feed spend the winter at a 
depth of 1,000 meters. Sometimes they go down to a depth of 
1,500 meters and very small quantities as far as 2,000 meters. 
We would remind you that the Komsomolets is lying at a depth of 
1,700 meters. Thus, there is a likelihood of the plankton and 
then the fish being subjected to radioactive contamination. But 
how great is it? That also has to be ascertained using the 
state-of-the-art monitoring apparatus, some of which has been 
developed by Russian specialists, some by foreigners. 
  What is more, one of the tasks facing the 1994 expedition is 
to rehearse the technologies for emergency and monitoring work 
in extraordinary situations in the oceans of the world. 
  This program will cost Russian taxpayers 4.625 billion 
rubles 
and [as published] $4.1 million. But evidently this expenditure 
is worth it in order to prevent a possible nuclear catastrophe 
and stop speculation over the problem.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Konstantin Gofman, managing director </F>
of the ecological-economic research area of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences Institute of Problems of the Market, under the 
rubric "Finances": "The Salvation of Nature Is in Tax Reform"] 
  [Text] "Rent and Taxes. New Approaches to Reforming 
Russia's Tax System." This was the title of the article in the 
weekly supplement to DM [DELOVOY MIR] of 17-23 January of this 
year. A number of pieces in later issues of the newspaper were 
devoted to the need for tax reform and its possible variants. 
Today the managing director of the ecological-economic research 
area of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Problems of 
the Market, Professor Konstantin Gofman, continues the 
topic. 
  Russia is in the throes of both an economic and an 
ecological 
crisis. Is a simultaneous and mutually linked approach to 
solving this situation realistic or, on the contrary, should the 
country's ecological normalization be postponed "until better 
times" and all efforts be thrown into economic revival? 
  The questions are by no means idle ones. The experience of 
Russian reforms shows that ecological priorities in our country 
are secondary not only in terms of their "official" status, but 
even in public awareness. The warnings of ecologists remain 
voices crying in the wilderness. Yes, it would seem, that is 
true: should we care about them now? Is it perhaps actually more 
sensible first to feed people (even with contaminated food and 
water) and activate the mechanisms of "market prosperity," and 
only then "readjust" them in the interests of protecting the 
environment? It is not without reason that among ecologists in 
rich countries the saying is common that "poverty is the chief 
polluter." 
  This problem is by no means a simple one, and there can be 
no 
simple solutions which are to be adopted. 
  Voices are now being raised (including in DELOVOY MIR) in 
favor of tax reform. I am certain: this is precisely the 
lever which will link the needs for financial stabilization and 
market liberalization of the economy with the requirements of 
ecological normalization. But something else is also clear: 
this reform cannot be done in one stroke. We need a long-term 
program of ecologization of the tax system; that is to say, its 
by-stage restructuring in the following basic directions: 

  -  gradually increasing the role of taxes on the use of the 
natural resource potential in all tax revenue in the budgets of 
the subjects of the Federation and local budgets; 
  -  expanding the base of natural resource taxation by 
introducing 
taxes on using the so-called assimilation potential of the 
environment; 
  -  introducing excise-type ecological taxes on goods and 
services 
whose consumption involves higher ecological risk; 
  -  expanding tax benefits for enterprises and organizations 
incorporating production of ecologically safe items or employing 
closed (low-waste) technological processes, as well as for 
physical and legal entities located in ecological disaster zones 
and in ecological crisis situations; 
  -  restricting direct and indirect subsidization of types of 
economic activity which are natural resource intensive and 
dangerous to the environment. 


    Taxation can be ecologized without reducing total revenue in 
the country's financial system, but it requires planned 
redistribution of the tax burden among participants in financial 
relations taking into account the tasks of economic 
stabilization and the social, ecological, and political 
priorities of society in conditions of the transition period. A 
reduction in taxes on labor and capital, announced in advance 
and carried out in stages, with a concurrent increase in the 
scope of natural resource taxation will stimulate structural 
reorganization of the economy to reduce its natural resource 
intensity. 
<H5>  Rental Income's Route into the Budget: Direct or Indirect? </H5>
  At present the role of the tax on land and other natural 
resources in the state's aggregate tax income is negligible. In 
itself this circumstance certainly does not mean that most 
rental income from nature use remains at the disposal of owners 
or users of natural wealth. The socialization of rental income, 
that is to say, its accumulation in state and local budgets 
through the tax system, can be carried out on one scale or 
another even without a direct tax on nature use--through 
taxation of income of nature users and buyers of their output 
(progressive taxes on personal income and profit, excise taxes, 
and the like). But here rental income seems to lose its identity 
and mix with other income in the "common pot" of the state 
budget and as part of the income of taxpayers themselves after 
they pay taxes. 
  However, the method of socialization of rental income--as a 
direct tax (payment) for nature use or through taxation of 
income of nature users and consumers of their output--has a 
definite effect on the ecological character of taxpayers' 
economic decisions and ultimately on the nature of society's 
socioeconomic development. 
  The greater the extent to which state income is formed 
through land tax (in the broad sense, that is, taxes generally 
on natural resources) while correspondingly reducing taxation of 
labor and capital, the stronger the economic stimuli for 
developing production will be. In addition, turning land rental 
into the main source for financing social (state) expenditures 
complies with the principles of social justice, since land as 
nature's gift is the property of the nation rather than the 
product of labor and capital. 
  Of no small importance is the fact that taxation of land 
leaves many fewer opportunities for tax evasion than taxation of 
personal income and entrepreneurial profit. 
  And finally, the last but not the least important argument 
in 
favor of changing over to predominant taxation of natural 
resource potential. Such a change would mean increasing economic 
stimuli for full and comprehensive use of natural wealth, since 
nature-conservative investments of labor and capital would be 
relatively cheaper for entrepreneurs. 
<H5>  The Main Difficulty </H5>
  What is holding things up? Why not change over, and soon, to 
the direct method of withdrawing rent into the budget? There are 
in my opinion profound reasons which rule out the possibility of 
transferring the focus in taxation to natural resource potential 
all at once. 
  Introducing a high tax on the use of land and other types of 
natural resources while correspondingly reducing other types of 
taxation would be a "neutral" measure in relation to the budget 
and taxpayers. But only on one condition--if the natural 
resource intensity of the economic activity of taxpayers was 
even roughly the same for everyone. But in reality indicators of 
land use intensity, water consumption intensity, and volume of 
harmful discharges calculated per cost unit of output produced 
and so forth differ among various enterprises (depending on 
their sectorial affiliation, technologies used, and the quality 
of the fuel and raw materials used) by factors of 10's and 
100's. That can be seen in the following table.

  The table cites certain data which characterize the scope of 
this differentiation broken down by aggregated sectors of the 
multisectorial balance of the former USSR. It is obvious that 
the gaps in natural resource intensity will rise many times over 
when changing from the sectorial level to the level of specific 
taxpayer enterprises. 
  For now payment for use of the natural resource potential 
has 
little impact on the economy of enterprises, and differences in 
their natural resource intensity are largely nullified; while 
taxation, especially in the form of value-added tax, maintains 
the established proportions of distribution of national income. 
  The situation changes fundamentally with the transition to 
taxation of natural resource potential. The disparity in the tax 
burden which reflects the disparity in the natural resource 
intensity of economic activity will in the long run undoubtedly 
prompt taxpayers to cut back natural resource intensive 
production facilities or reduce their natural resource 
intensity. But a "shock" transfer, all at once, of the focus of 
taxation to natural resource potential, that is to say, 
establishment of a single payment rate for land and other 
natural resources of the particular quality and location for 
everyone, would inevitably result in the emergence of enormous 
disproportions in the withdrawal of income from enterprises with 
differing levels of natural resource intensity. 
  It is for that reason that a transfer all at once to 
taxation 
of natural resource potential while reducing other types of 
taxation accordingly could lead to an economic "collapse" of 
economic systems which in terms of its negative consequences 
would exceed all the well-known results of the "shock" effect on 
socioeconomic processes. The natural resource system of taxation 
is incompatible with the "nonecologized" economic structure of 
contemporary production and consumption oriented to the relative 
cheapness and availability of natural wealth. 
<H5>  It Is for the Regions To Decide </H5>
  There is an important restraint on the development of 
natural 
resource taxation in the particular conditions of the Russian 
Federation. The receipt into the federal budget of rental income 
from using natural resource potential accumulated in the tax on 
land and other natural resources will to all appearances meet 
opposition from the subjects of the Federation and even provoke 
separatist tendencies. Consequently taxes not directly related 
to nature use, above all taxes on income of physical and legal 
entities collected at rates which are the same for the entire 
country, must maintain their significance as the main source of 
income of the federal budget. In contrast, revenue from taxes 
for using the natural resource potential of the corresponding 
territories must predominate in the income of the budgets of the 
subjects of the Federation and local budgets. 
  For at least two-three years into the future, large-scale 
ecologically positive changes cannot be expected in the 
sectorial, technological, and territorial structure of economic 
activity. It is hardly possible within this time to 
fundamentally increase financing of nature protection activity 
from budget system capital. In these conditions a by-stage 
redistribution of tax pressure on enterprises seems realistic: a 
reduction for ecologically safe types of activity and an 
increase for natural resource intensive ones. Until a market for 
the right to land use (land ownership and rental) is formed 
through a system of sale auctions of this right, it would be 
wise to grant the subjects of the Federation the right to 
determine the yearly estimated value of land for the 
purposes of taxation. As rough estimates show, if taxation 
of profit is limited exclusively by the needs of the federal 
budget, the tax rate on profit could be reduced to one-third of 
the present level. And here the amount of the land tax would be 
increased roughly 12-fold as compared with the existing level. 
  But of course the transition to such an assessment of land 
(as was said, specifically for the purposes of taxation) will 
not replace forming a mechanism for its market appraisal through 
the development of purchase and sale, security, and rental of 
rights to land use, but it may become the transitional link in 
bringing today's almost symbolic land tax rates closer to the 
market value of agricultural and especially urban land. The 
method of taxation itself is important here, in a percentage of 
the appraisal of the land rather than in fixed rates per unit of 
area. In principle this protects tax revenue from inflationary 
depreciation better. 
<H5>  The Problem of Appraisal </H5>
  The enormous organizational-technical complications of the 
practical realization of this concept must certainly be taken 
into account. The concept presupposes a regular reappraisal of 
land and other taxable natural resources as often as possible, 
necessarily excluding from this appraisal the market value of 
the real estate objects existing on it (the "pre-improvement" 
value of the land parcel) as well as rental income from capital 
investments which raise the long-term economic potential of the 
object of taxation (investments in prospecting for and exploring 
mineral deposits, in long-term improvement of agricultural land, 
in the engineering and social infrastructure of urban 
territories, and so forth). All rental income of this type 
(according to Marxist terminology, differential rent II) is 
income from capital rather than from land as such, and therefore 
may be excluded from the tax base when the land tax is 
calculated. 
  Even if all the methodological difficulties related to 
computing the "pre-improvement" value of land parcels are 
considered surmountable, it is obvious that the corresponding 
appraisal work will hardly keep pace with the constant and 
fairly rapid (as world experience shows) rise in the value of 
land and other natural wealth. Consequently the need for 
additional regulatory taxes on the profit of nature users, on 
the sale of land, on security transactions with land parcels, 
and the like will remain. 
  Information generated by the land market is essential in 
order to accurately determine the value of land as an object of 
taxation. The trouble is that when differential rent I is 
completely taken from land users, the land market is inevitably 
transformed into a real estate market for land and ceases to 
generate information on the pre-improvement value of land 
parcels. 
  Therefore, back in the early stages of the evolution of land 
taxation, there must be intensive development of land appraisal 
work oriented not only to the needs of city planning and 
agricultural land management (which was characteristic of the 
centralized economy), but also for the purposes of the 
formation, functioning, and tax regulation of the land market as 
part of the real estate market. This is a field of resource 
appraisal work which is fundamentally new to our country, and it 
is in dire need of scientific methods support and basic 
interdisciplinary research. 
  As for enterprises of the mining sectors, here the strategic 
direction should be a transition from a multitude of taxation 
systems (excise taxes, payments for the right to use the earth's 
interior, and deductions for reproduction of the mineral-raw 
material base) to a system of unified territorial taxes on the 
extraction of minerals. The object of taxation should be the 
usable volume of balance reserves of fuel and raw materials, 
rather than only the volume of saleable output as it is now. 
Then losses and expenditures for inhouse needs as well as the 
amount of reserves of minerals allotted to enterprises will be 
"reckoned in." Tax rates should be set in percentages of the 
value of the tax base in current prices with a differentiation 
depending on the geological-economic conditions of extraction. 
  In this case, the amount of the tax on the extraction of 
minerals will depend on three basic factors: 
  1) the level of prices for output being extracted, 
  2) the degree of completeness and intensiveness of the use 
of 
reserves, and 
  3) differences in the geological-economic conditions of 
extraction. This taxation procedure will encourage conservation 
of mineral reserves, which is extremely timely for enterprises 
working in favorable geological-economic conditions and at the 
same time ensures more complete accumulation of rental income in 
territorial budgets. 
<H5>  The Payment for Pollution </H5>
  Since the late 1980's, Russia has been forming a unique 
system, with virtually nothing like it in world practice, of 
payments by enterprises of all forms of ownership for the 
discharge (run-off) of pollutants into the atmosphere and water 
sources and for waste disposal. Formed at the same time was a 
system of state nonbudget ecology funds whose basic source of 
capital was the payment for pollution. 
  Analysis of the results of the practical application of this 
system in 1992-1993 shows that the fiscal function of payments 
is being performed relatively successfully overall. Thanks to 
the creation of conditions for financing protection of the 
environment from the capital of nonbudget ecology funds, 
independent of the budget, this sphere suffered to a lesser 
degree from the investment "cave-in" of 1992. While the total 
volume of investments in the economy declined by 45 percent in 
1992, capital investments in environmental protection from all 
sources of financing dropped by only 20 percent. To a 
considerable degree the practice of exempting enterprises from 
payments for pollution based on the amount of capital they used 
to finance their own capital investments in environmental 
protection helped achieve this. This system must be improved by 
raising its incentive value. 
  From the editorial office: The number of Russian cities 
declared ecological disaster zones is constantly rising. This is 
the topic of the article by the DM columnist, Lyudmila 
Biryukova, "The Sword of Damocles Has Gone into Action," 
published on pp 30-31. 
  [Box No 1] 
  The subject of this article is essentially not just taxes. 
It 
is rather the transition from the "well-traveled" but dead-end 
road to a fundamentally new type of socioeconomic development. 
The difficulties of the transition are obvious. Unfortunately, 
as fundamental decisions are put off and palliatives are 
substituted, these difficulties merely intensify. In both cases 
society must pass between the Scylla of the socioeconomic 
upheavals of the transition period and the Charybdis of 
continuation of the old course. 
  But it must be resolved. 
  [Box No 2] 
  The author warns: We need a gradual increase in the role of 
natural resource taxation in the formation of state income, a 
role programmed for the long term and legislatively fixed, 
rather than an "avalanche" of restructuring of tax revenue all 
at one time...

  [Text] [Addressed to:] B. N. Yeltsin, president, Russian 
Federation; R. I. Khasbulatov, chairman, Supreme Soviet, Russian 
Federation; V. S. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Council of 
Ministers -- Government of the Russian Federation 
  The members of the Russian Academy of Sciences consider it 
necessary to draw your attention to the catastrophic situation 
into which the Russian environment has fallen. The environmental 
protection system, organized over the course of many years by 
several generations of leading scientists and practical workers 
and functioning quite successfully, is now being destroyed as a 
result of disintegration processes. 
  We are losing enormous natural resources. There has been a 
sharp increase in poaching, which is resulting in the mass 
annihilation of many species of plants and animals, including 
those listed in the Red Book and which constitute a national 
treasure of Russia. A barbarous looting of the country's 
national resources is in progress. Here are only several 
examples. 
  In the Far East during the postwar years it was possible to 
increase the numbers of the Ussuri tiger with great difficulty. 
However, recently it is being intensively exterminated by 
poachers: the skin, claws and whiskers of the tiger are highly 
valued in the countries of Southeast Asia (Japan, Korea, China), 
to which they also are frequently exported. The absolute freedom 
from prosecution for poaching activity is astonishing. 
Announcements of sale are not only posted in the streets of Far 
Eastern cities, but also are being published in the local 
newspapers and broadcast by radio. If decisive measures are not 
immediately taken for preserving the tiger it will disappear 
completely. 
  The Far Eastern leopard is on the verge of extinction: its 
numbers do not exceed 20-30 specimens; there is an immediate 
need for drawing up and implementing a program for saving this 
species. Bears are being annihilated in mass numbers; the 
principal reason is the extraction of bear bile, which also has 
a high value in the markets of Southeast Asia. There has been a 
sharp increase in the poaching of the izyubr and the Siberian 
stag: they are being killed off for their velvet-covered antlers 
and these also are being criminally exported abroad. During 
recent years there has been a 50% decrease in the numbers 
of 
the musk deer, being annihilated for musk gland of the males 
(musk stream); according to available data, the exportation is 
taking place in part through Estonia. The kill of the mountain 
antelope, which has been listed in the Russian Red Book, has 
increased by several times and now its total numbers are only 
500-700 specimens. The kill of the Tatary antelope, whose horn 
is used in Tibetan medicine, has been virtually uncontrolled. 
Mutilated cadavers in the hundreds remain in the steppe. On the 
Anadyr Plateau the mountain sheep, which only recently was quite 
plentiful, has been completely annihilated. In addition to 
individual species, many unique natural territories have been 
under the threat of annihilation. 
  Under different pretexts, even within the structure of 
environmental protection agencies, numerous commercial 
organizations are being set up which are engaged in the sale and 
export of animals and unique materials for collections, the 
organization of paid-for hunts and tourism even in reserved 
territories, which always was categorically forbidden. 
  At the International Conference in Rio de Janeiro (June 
1992), held with the participation of the leaders of many 
countries, among the principal documents a Convention on 
Biological Diversity was adopted. It was written in the 
Convention that the states, having sovereign rights to their 
biological resources, bear responsibility for their maintenance 
and stable use. The Convention provides for the preparation by 
each covenanting party of a national strategy and program for 
maintaining and using biological diversity, implementing 
monitoring, adopting timely measures for the rehabilitation and 
restoration of degrading ecosystems and encouragement of 
research favoring maintenance and stable use of their biological 
heritage. A task of primary importance is ensuring the 
preservation of rare and disappearing species and ecosystems; 
their loss will be irretrievable. Russian biologists have worked 
out such a program and it should receive the status of a 
national program and be included among the programs of priority 
importance. Appropriate legislative acts for its implementation 
must be adopted within the framework of this program. 
  The scientists of the Russian Academy of Sciences feel that 
the need has long passed for establishing in Russia a unified 
national system for the protection and regulation of biological 
resources. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources of the Russian Federation should be the basic 
department for the organization of such a structure. There is a 
need for bringing up to the world level the area of specially 
protected natural territories (up to four-five% of the 
entire 
area of the country), ensuring adequate funding for their 
organization and management. All measures must be adopted in 
order that there be full implementation of the Edict of the 
President of the Russian Federation dated 2 October 1992, No 
1155, "On Specially Protected Natural Territories in the Russian 
Federation" and the Law "On Environmental Protection," put into 
effect by a Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian 
Federation dated 19 December 1991, No 2061-1. 
  We are hoping for your active participation. 
  Delay is out of the question.

  [Text] Russia's Ministry for Emergencies plans to buy 
equipment that will make live telecast possible from the 
nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets that sunk in the Norwegian 
sea on April 7, 1989. There are two torpedoes with nuclear 
warheads, containing 3200 grams of 239-plutonium on board the 
vessel. 
  As was noted at a meeting of senior ministry officials in 
Moscow on Monday, all is ready for an expedition to the 
Norwegian sea. Specialists will sail on the Academician Keldysh 
from Kaliningrad on June 15 to complete their work by August 15. 
  They are to seal off the submarine's front section, conduct 
technical tests on the vessel and check its inflated safe 
chamber, lying on the sea bed six kilometers from Komsomolets. 
  The Deputy Director of the Federal Nuclear Center Arzamas-16 
Stepan Kravchenko disclosed at the meeting that a new device 
would be installed on board Komsomolets to detect uranium and 
plutonium carrying weapons. This will make it possible to 
monitor the level of radioactive pollution continuously even 
after the end of the expedition. 
  Since it is very hard to say how the submarine will fare in 
the future, it should be sealed as quickly as possible, 
Kravchenko said. 
  The ministry expects the beryllium casings of the torpedoes 
with nuclear warheads to be destroyed through corrosion in late 
1995 or early 1996. 
  As a deputy minister Sergey Khetagurov has told Interfax, 
yet 
another expedition to the Norwegian sea is planned next year to 
carry out the second stage of the sealing operation to make 
Komsomolets complete safe.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Bayduzhiy </F>
under the rubric "Danger": "Russia Has Little Time Left To 
Prevent a Nuclear Disaster: A Blowout of the Nuclear Filling of 
the Submarine `Komsomolets' Is Becoming Increasingly Realistic" 
Designations "For Official Use" and "Top Secret" are as 
published in original Russian source.] 
  [Text] Two times already this year NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA has dealt with the situation which has developed 
concerning the preparations for an expedition to the 
nuclear-powered vessel, "Komsomolets," which sank in the 
Norwegian Sea five years ago. These articles as well as the 
fifth anniversary of the vessel's loss which was observed 
attracted attention not just among the public but even in the 
departments whose sluggishness has almost caused the process of 
immobilizing the ship to break down. 
  The main administration of the RF Ministry for 
Emergency Situations (MinChS), which was responsible for 
organizing the expedition to the site of the "Komsomolets's" 
loss, hastily began to put together cadres. The first 300 
million rubles [R], perhaps not a large amount but even so 
perfectly real money, was allocated in early April to prepare 
the expedition. 
  But it is still too early to put the story of the 
"Komsomolets" to rest. 
<H5>  A Problem Which Does Not Exist? </H5>
  In early April 1994, a number of mass information media all 
at once, each claiming to have been the first to receive the 
exclusive information, at first alluding to "a responsible 
employee of one of the ministries who asked to remain anonymous" 
and then directly indicating official sources in the MinChS, 
circulated a report entitled "Expert Analysis of the Condition 
and Prediction of Long-term Radioecological Consequences of the 
Accident and Location of the Atomic Submarine `Komsomolets' on 
the Bottom of the Norwegian Sea." This document, which was part 
of the material of the 33rd volume of the archives of the former 
Committee for Conducting Special Underwater Tasks (KOPRON), was 
presented as a secret one, and thus had been inaccessible to 
journalists and the public. In addition to the technical data on 
the "Komsomolets's" condition, it cited the calculations of a 
number of experts regarding the probable development of a 
radioecological situation near the sunken vessel. In their 
calculations, the authors came to the conclusion that even if 
the plutonium from the warheads of the torpedoes was washed out, 
no more than 30-400 square kilometers of the bottom would be 
contaminated and the radiation doses on the distant borders 
would be "very negligible." On that basis the conclusion was 
drawn that given "the absence of economic damages from the 
atomic submarine's being there in its sunken state for a long 
time," there was no need to "conduct expensive work to seal off 
the reactor bay and the torpedo tubes." And so the developers of 
the document proposed abandoning any work on the "Komsomolets" 
at all, limiting it to nothing but radioecological monitoring at 
the site where the vessel had sunk to "lessen the 
social-psychological and political tension surrounding this 
problem." 
  The report which made its way from the depths of the MinChS 
to the press served as a basis for the publication of almost 
sensational materials on the day of the fifth anniversary of the 
loss of the "Komsomolets." According to them, the vessel which 
sank in the Norwegian Sea does not pose any realistic danger and 
the threats related to it are strongly exaggerated. But the fuss 
raised by the mass information media concerning the vessel 
forced the MinChS to declassify the report, it became clear. At 
the same time, it was alleged that there was no problem of the 
"Komsomolets" as such and there was no reason to upset the 
population about it. 
<H5>  The `Secret' of Volume 33 </H5>
  The truth that the most plausible lie is a half truth is as 
old as the world but no less true because of that. A half truth 
can be created by putting forward certain facts and hiding 
others. It is precisely this device which the authors of the 
premeditated information leak used by releasing the "secret" 
document to the press. But the facts cited in it are only a part 
of the truth. The other, which was concealed from journalists 
but is undoubtedly familiar to the MinChS leadership, is that 
practically right after its appearance in 1993, the report with 
such a favorable prognosis was sent for an expert study at the 
All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental 
Physics (VNIIEF). Its results dispelled the unfounded optimism. 
In verifying the methodology of the calculations, it turned out 
that the authors began from false premises by significantly 
exaggerating the speed at which the plutonium would dissolve and 
separate out in sea water. The underwater currents which 
increase the contamination spot to 100-1,000 kilometers and a 
whole number of other factors were not taken into account. In a 
review signed by S. Voronin, the chief designer of VNIIEF, Yu. 
Trutnev, the first deputy scientific manager, and other 
specialists of the institute, the calculations cited were 
declared wrong and inadequately substantiated, while the 
conclusions on the need to abandon work to prevent radionuclides 
from getting into the surrounding sea were found to be 
"premature." The need to immobilize the vessel's nuclear 
ammunition as quickly as possible was confirmed once again. The 
document subjected to an expert study was sent to the archives, 
while KOPRON, which still existed at that time, began to make 
preparations for an expedition to immobilize the corroding 
warheads of the nuclear torpedoes in the summer of 1994. 
  But the rejected finding did not lie in the archives for 
long. In January 1994, KOPRON was disbanded and its functions 
transferred to MinChS, which was created then and for a long 
time forgot about the "Komsomolets's" existence. But after the 
articles published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, the MinChS was 
immediately required to justify its inaction which put the 
expedition to the Norwegian Sea on the verge of failure and the 
long-ago report issued to journalists as the "secret of Volume 
33" was brought to light. For greater persuasiveness, its 
materials were accompanied with the classifications DSP [For 
Official Use] and "Top Secret" [as published]. The logic of the 
authors of the artificial information leak was simple: Since 
there was no unanimous opinion regarding the degree of danger 
related to the "Komsomolets" even among experts, it was hardly 
worthwhile to hold the MinChS leadership responsible for 
stopping work in this direction. 
<H5>  The Specialists' Unanimity </H5>
  In fact there is no disagreement among serious scientists 
and 
specialists regarding further actions with the "Komsomolets," 
and there never has been. All of them, and the KOPRON materials 
have as many documents which confirm this as you might want, 
favor immobilizing the vessel's destroyed nuclear ammunition as 
quickly as possible. Here are the opinions of certain highly 
respected experts. 
  Academician N. Laverov, vice president of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences: "After reviewing the materials 
presented for the expert study on the issues of eliminating the 
consequences of the accident on the `Komsomolets' 
nuclear-powered vessel, the Russian Academy of Sciences deems it 
necessary... in 1994 to work to seal off torpedo tubes Nos 5 and 
6, which contain nuclear ammunition." 
  Yu. Vishnevskiy, chairman of Gosatomnadzor Rossii 
[Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation 
Security]: "We consider it necessary to develop technology 
and carry out the operations work to seal off the nuclear 
ammunition in order to prevent the plutonium compounds from 
spreading into the environment." 
  S. Grigorov, chief of the RF Ministry of Defense 
Administration of Ecology and Special Safety Equipment: "In 
order to eliminate the radiation leak of plutonium from the two 
destroyed nuclear warheads... we consider it necessary... to 
seal off their internal spaces and the nuclear-powered vessel's 
forward end as a whole." 
  V. Konovalov, the RF first deputy minister of atomic energy, 
F. Gromov, the commander in chief of the Navy, and A. Pogodin, 
the RF first deputy minister of protection of the environment 
and natural resources, gave similar conclusions. It is worth 
mentioning here that the specialists' assessments cited were 
delivered in September-October 1993, even before a new form of 
existence of plutonium in the form of suspended particles, 
macrosols, was found in the water samples taken at the site of 
the accident, and they made the radiation situation near the 
vessel even more menacing. 
  All these expert opinions were placed in the last, newest 
volumes of KOPRON archives, which total 82 volumes. In 
accordance with the edict of the president of Russia on 
declassifying ecological information, the documentation kept in 
it was never closed and, at least before being handed over to 
the MinChS, remained accessible not only to specialists but to 
interested journalists as well. Of the thousand documents 
contained in the archives, only a few bore the classification 
"For Official Use," which, considering the former top secret 
treatment of the "Komsomolets," was perfectly explicable. So one 
must certainly not speak of the "secrets" of Volume No 33 and 
other volumes of the KOPRON archives. Incidentally, the MinChS 
leadership might not have even known that, and it was for that 
reason that they began to leak information which was not in 
keeping with reality, holding back the findings which refuted 
their conclusions. 
<H5>  A Latent Danger </H5>
  Another myth created to justify the uselessness of rendering 
the "Komsomolets" harmless was the allegation that its nuclear 
filling was too small to do any substantial harm to the 
environment. To support this, statistics which say that as a 
result of testing Soviet nuclear weapons alone, 54,000 curie of 
strontium-90 and cesium-137 fell into the waters of the Barents 
Sea, while radioactive waste whose total radioactivity exceeds 
the "Komsomolets's" "baggage" by a factor of 10 has been sunk in 
the seas and oceans. 
  The inaccuracy of such comparisons is that they are talking 
of altogether different elements. Cesium and strontium, which 
are formed as a result of nuclear explosions and the operation 
of atomic reactors, are classified as so-called short-lived 
elements. Their half-life does not exceed a few years and in 
dispersing into the atmosphere over enormous expanses of ocean 
or slowly seeping out from rusting tanks, they are incapable of 
resulting in any marked increase in the radiation background. 
The plutonium contained in the nuclear ammunition of the 
"Komsomolets" is something else. Its half-life is 24,000 years. 
Besides, plutonium is classified as an extremely toxic 
substance, 10,000 times more toxic than arsenic. So getting into 
sea water, it represents an enormous danger. Even if the 
"Komsomolets's" filling is compared with the discharges 
resulting from nuclear weapons experiments, according to expert 
calculations only 100 curie of plutonium ended up in the Barents 
Sea during the entire time the experiments were conducted on 
Novaya Zemlya. But the vessel's torpedoes contain 4 times as 
much--430 curie. A blowout of them during a short time in one 
place can lead to truly catastrophic consequences. 
  But the danger related to plutonium by no means stops there. 
As everyone knows, this element does not have beta and gamma ray 
activity. And it takes several months to identify its inherent 
alpha ray activity using existing instruments. This means that 
it will be impossible to efficiently monitor the level of 
radioactive contamination of the Norwegian Sea and the fish 
swimming in it. A device which could do this, unlike any other 
in the world, is just now being developed by the specialists of 
Arzamas-16. By order, incidentally, of KOPRON itself. 
<H5>  How Much Does a Disaster Cost? </H5>
  How much can the radiation disaster, if it does in fact 
occur, cost Russia and the entire world? NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
[NG] has already written about how the region of the 
"Komsomolets's" loss is one of the most biologically productive 
in the Norwegian Sea. The vessel lies at a depth of 1,700 
meters, which is exactly where plankton winter and then with 
their seasonal migration rise to the surface and serve as food 
for fish. Moreover, the hydrochlorides and hydroxides of 
plutonium, combining with the products of the corrosion of other 
metals, form macrosols which can be carried to fishing industry 
regions by strong vertical and horizontal currents. All these 
facts were confirmed in the report of the Polar Scientific 
Research Institute of the Ocean Fish Industry and Oceanography 
imeni Knipovich and are well known to ichthyologists. In October 
1993, V. Korelskiy, the chairman of the RF Committee on the 
Fishing Industry, gave his finding on the amount of probable 
damage: "The `Komsomolets' nuclear-powered vessel [NPV] which 
sank is a potential source of long-term radioactive 
contamination of the northern seas, which naturally may involve 
Russia's losing its traditional fishing industry. It is 
difficult to assess the negative consequences of the disaster 
for the fishing industry economy, although preliminary estimates 
of the possible damage during the five-year period totaled an 
astronomical sum--more than R3.5 trillion in 1993 prices." Any 
commentary here is hardly necessary. 
  Incidentally, Russia will bear losses not only from the 
reduction in its extraction of fish. The Norwegian Sea is 
traditionally a zone of Norway's ecological interests, and if 
just one cod netted has traces of isotopes of plutonium of 
manmade origin, an international scandal will erupt. The scale 
of it will exceed many times over the complications which arose 
after Russia dumped just 0.38 curie of liquid radioactive waste 
in the Sea of Japan. The fishing companies of the United States, 
Japan, and France, for whom this will be a fine opportunity to 
supplant the competitive Norwegian firms in the fish market, 
will not let the passions die. A Norway which has lost its 
market will have nothing left to do but demand that the annual 
losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars be reimbursed by 
Russia. And the Russian government, according to international 
sea law, will have to pay them. 
<H5>  Not Raise, but Immobilize </H5>
  A radiation disaster in the Norwegian Sea can be averted 
only 
one way, by sealing off the nuclear torpedoes in the forward end 
of the NPV. The option of raising the vessel was rejected by 
specialists back in 1991. There were many reasons for this, the 
main one being that the vessel's hull is virtually destroyed. In 
addition, because of the fact that the speed of corrosion of the 
steel near the titanium hull of the "Komsomolets" is 10 times 
more than usual, the bolts which reinforce the lid of the atomic 
reactor are most likely already ruined, and it is lying 
virtually free on the base. If the vessel were tilted even 
slightly, and if it were raised that is almost inevitable, the 
reactor's lid would slip off and spill its radioactive filling 
into the water. But even if the vessel could be raised 
absolutely vertically, the result would be the same. Because of 
the differential in pressure inside and outside the reactor and 
the gas residue in the high pressure system, when raised its 
contents would in fact gush as if pumped into the sea. 
  In 1993 KOPRON specialists developed a plan for immobilizing 
the vessel by which all the openings in its forward end would be 
closed off. It was planned to insert a special chitosan-based 
sorbing compound in the interwall space, and a special batch of 
it was manufactured by the Committee's order. On 4 January 1994, 
the plan was handed over for an ecological expert study, and six 
days later, in connection with the creation of the MinChS, the 
Committee was disbanded and all the work to make preparations 
for the expedition to the Norwegian Sea stopped. The departure 
of the research ship "Akademik Keldysh" to sea with "Mir" deep 
water equipment on board was open to question for the reasons 
which NG has already written about. And, as the story concerning 
the information "leak" which threw the Russian and international 
community into confusion showed, the MinChS leadership 
responsible for rendering the "Komsomolets" harmless was more 
concerned with hiding its own inaction, lack of professionalism, 
and negligence than with preventing the coming disaster. 
  Meanwhile, the expedition can be conducted this summer only 
by starting preparations for it in the coming days. Urgent 
measures are needed. A specially authorized organ consisting of 
truly competent specialists, most importantly ones with an 
interest in solving the problem, could carry those measures out. 
I. Spasskiy, the general designer of the Rubin Central Design 
Bureau, T. Borisov, the former chief of KOPRON, Yu. Kormilitsyn, 
the chief designer of the "Komsomolets," and a whole number of 
prominent experts have expressed their agreement to work on 
immobilizing the vessel without pay. 
<H5>  KOPRON or the MinChS? </H5>
  The story of the "Komsomolets" has another side as well. In 
early 1994, when KOPRON was disbanded and its tasks charged to 
the Ministry for Emergency Situations which was being created, 
almost all the submariners and designers of seagoing equipment 
lodged protests against this reorganization. And the point is 
not even that, as for example O. Ilyin, who supervised both 
these structures in the government apparat, warned, such a 
reorganization would almost certainly result in delay and 
breakdown of the work on the "Komsomolets." KOPRON, which in 
nine months of its work managed to conduct a unique study of the 
"Komsomolets" and recruited 42 domestic enterprises, most of 
which were part of the military-industrial complex which is 
undergoing conversion, to cooperate had every chance of becoming 
the world leader in the area of deepwater work. There is a very 
great need for such work on the international market, and the 
operation to immobilize the "Komsomolets" automatically creates 
unprecedented publicity for the organization that does it and 
ensures orders for many years into the future. It is precisely 
for that reason that a consortium of Dutch firms is so eager now 
to receive the contract to immobilize the vessel with the aid of 
the international fund in memory of the "Komsomolets." And the 
disbanding of KOPRON buried the hopes of many Russian defense 
workers to use it to resolve the problem of their conversion. 
This measure proved to be doubly wrong for the additional reason 
that sooner or later Russia will all the same have to create 
such an organ. A considerable number of dangerous objects have 
been sunk near its shores, including 8 atomic reactors, almost 
24,000 tanks of radioactive waste, and hundreds of thousands of 
containers with toxic substances and chemical weapons. They all 
have to at least be monitored if not raised. These are perhaps 
not immediate tasks, but all the same they are tasks for the 
future. But now it is important to conduct the operation to 
immobilize the "Komsomolets" as quickly as possible. The vessel 
lying in the depths of the Norwegian Sea represents a real 
danger, not one devised by panicky specialists and journalists 
after a sensational story. Russia has little time left to 
eliminate this danger.

  [Excerpts] Stockholm, 2 Jun -- The second day of Russian 
Deputy Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha's visit to Denmark began 
with a speech at a meeting of environmental protection and 
finance ministers of the countries of eastern and central 
Europe. [passage omitted] 
  The reduction in industrial production, A. Zaveryukha noted 
in particular, has not led to a corresponding reduction in 
environmental pollution in Russia. One-fifth of the population 
lives in conditions where there is a permanently high level of 
air pollution, and there has been no improvement in the quality 
of drinking water. Research into the consequences of the 
Chernobyl accident show that the border of the zone with soil 
contaminated with radioactive caesium-137 in excess of one curie 
per cubic kilometer has increased by 8.8 square kilometers. 
This zone today includes the territory of 17 oblasts. 
  The increase in soil erosion -- which affects 56 percent of 
agricultural land in differing degrees -- is particularly 
worrying. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Abram Ioyrysh, doctor of juridical sciences, and </F>
Yuriy Rogozhin, candidate of technical sciences, under the 
rubric "Ecology": "Russia's Nature Protection Legislation Far 
From Perfect: A Problem Which Must Not Be Put Off"] 
  [Text] Judging crimes guided not by the law but by one's 
own concepts of law and justice is a characteristic Russian 
feature. But juridical VUZes [higher educational institutions] 
do not teach one to judge "by conscience," since this is a 
direct path to arbitrary action. 
  But it is precisely this path which Russian law enforcement 
is forced to take when investigating nature protection offenses. 
There are several reasons for this. In the former USSR, 
essentially there is not a single nature protection law. In 1986 
the unlucky managers of the Chernobyl AES were tried not because 
an enormous amount of territory was contaminated and removed 
from economic use as a result of the accident at the 
installation entrusted to them. The directors of the power plant 
and the main engineer were convicted of negligence in performing 
official duties. With such a definition of their actions, they 
could count on amnesty, and that in fact occurred several years 
later. 
  Only in late 1991 was a strictly ecological Law "On 
Protecting the Natural Environment" adopted for the first time 
in Russia, which by now was free. This law devotes a great deal 
of space to altogether new provisions on ecological monitoring, 
the ecological expert study, and an economic mechanism for 
protecting the environment. 
  The law moved environment protection from the departmental 
level to the level of a global, national, and state-wide problem 
with priority status. But the direct effect of the law was 
complicated by the vagueness and lack of specificity of some of 
its language, which gave room for departmental enactments and 
interpretations. 
  Many of the law's provisions even now need refinement. The 
structure of power and government and regional policy have 
changed and the very approach to defining ecological safety and 
ecological damage has changed. Obviously, certain provisions of 
the law, especially the parts dealing with the rights of the 
subjects of the Federation, the economic mechanism, and 
accountability, should be expanded. 
  Articles on the ecological expert study are virtually 
infeasible in practice because the question of whether experts 
who prepare the finding are officials and on some level bear 
responsibility for the expert study's results has not been 
decided. The articles devoted to the right of citizens to a good 
environment are also poorly worded, and as a result judges 
cannot apply these articles in practice. 
  Disputes on the amount of damages caused by military actions 
and interterritorial disputes may become unique. The law should 
designate a rigid Russian position regarding foreign violators 
of the law's articles. 
  The question arises of what is worse, a bad law or the 
complete lack of one. We have already written that for many 
years the USSR was the only state in the world which used atomic 
energy extensively for both peaceful and military purposes 
without legal foundations for doing so. That is precisely how 
the lack of even one law regulating the use of atomic energy in 
the country can be described. (It is precisely for that reason 
that the legislative organs of the former USSR must bear a share 
of the blame for the Chernobyl disaster.) 
  No matter how paradoxical it may seem, the situation with 
the 
lack of atomic legislation has in fact not changed today. True, 
in 1993 the Supreme Soviet adopted three "atomic" laws in the 
first reading: "On the Use of Atomic Energy," "On State Policy 
on the Handling of Radioactive Waste," and "On the Status of 
Territories Contaminated as a Result of Radiation Disasters." 
The October events in Moscow and the breakup of the Supreme 
Soviet prevented the final adoption of these laws. And the new 
Federal Assembly, it seems, is not yet interested in atomic 
legislation. 
  So, legal support of protection of the natural environment 
is 
clearly unsatisfactory in Russia. What should the law 
enforcement organs do in this situation and how should 
law-abiding citizens behave? 
  The simplest thing is to ignore the issue, alluding to the 
need to resolve more important problems first. Indeed, we must 
not forget about the worsening economy, growing crime, and many 
other misfortunes which have befallen poor Russia. That is all 
true, but we must not resolve the problems listed one at a time. 
They are closely related to one another and they can be resolved 
only as a set. 
  But, on the other hand, we should not step up work on 
economic problems on the basis of the old technology. For 
following the unfortunate tradition, departments may formulate 
laws "to suit themselves," restricting themselves to empty 
declarations and not taking the interests of all citizens into 
account. For these reasons the State Duma must not transfer the 
power of legislative initiative in resolving ecological problems 
to executive organs. 
  But until the paternal lawmakers give us adequate ecology 
law, nature protection organs and individual citizens are 
permitted to live and act according to their consciences. If it 
works out...

  [Summary] Almaty has a great chance of becoming one of the 
most polluted capitals in the world in the near future. This 
sad fact was stated by Bulat Yesekin, the head of the city 
directorate for ecology and bioresources in an interview with 
our correspondent. The state has not allocated any money for the 
improvement of Almaty's ecology either in the current or last 
year. Even the external budgeting fund for protection of 
nature, which used to finance several important programs, will 
be used by the government for other purposes. 
  The city needs new roads and traffic controls because the 
number of cars in the capital increases annually by a third. 
The quality of gas leaves much to be desired. The life of 
catalysts, which were used to purify car exhausts, expire very 
quickly nowadays. The city has two power engineering units that 
are very unsafe ecologically. 
  The president of the republic issued an edict last year on 
urgent measures for the development of Almaty, in conformity 
with which the Ministry of Power Engineering and Fuel Resources 
was to provide its Almaty enterprises with low-ash coal and 
low-sulphur fuel oil, but the only thing that the ministry has 
done is to persuade the government to set flexible norms of air 
pollution. This has only worsened the situation. 
  The city and the oblast do not have special sites for 
storing 
toxic waste. The recycling of garbage needs improvement. 
  These problems become even more topical in view of the 
mountains surrounding the city. Our capital has no natural 
ventilation. Currently, Almaty leads as a city with the most 
polluted air in the republic, ranking second to Leninogorsk, 
which is the largest industrial center. It is not by chance 
that the population in Almaty ranks second to no one in the 
number of diseases of the respiratory, cardio-vascular, nervous, 
and urino-genital systems. Their health is also affected by the 
fact that the soil in the city and subsoil waters are noxious.

  [Text] Kiev--Valeriy Sirenko, deputy head of the main 
ecological inspectorate at Ukraine's Environmental Protection 
Ministry, told a UNIAN correspondent on 31 May that the joint 
commission of the Environmental Protection Ministry, the Defense 
Ministry, the State Oil and Gas Committee, the State Housing 
Services Committee, and the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine 
representatives--the commission of which he is in 
charge--completed preliminary calculations with regard to 
expenditures required to restore the environment damaged as a 
result of activity by the Black Sea Fleet. The sum of this 
damage is around 19.6 billion dollars. 
  An approximate four billion dollars is needed to resolve the 
ecological problems of Sevastopol alone, with 108 million 
dollars required specifically to regenerate 2,016 hectares of 
land in places where Black Sea Fleet units and facilities are 
deployed and to decontaminate the soil saturated with petroleum 
products. 
  Account should also be taken of expenditures required for 
cleansing the harbors to remove oil and other harmful substances 
that are constantly being dumped into the sea and to improve the 
health of the population that is being affected by the 
ecological calamity. 
  Sirenko said: "The state of the environment around 
Sevastopol 
is infernal. Harbors are polluted with trash and oil. The 
fleet's oil collectors are defunct. The command of the Russian 
Black Sea Fleet, however, has failed to find time to meet 
Ukraine's Environmental Protection Ministry commission."

<F P=106> [Konstantin Parishkura report from Kiev in the "Ukraine" </F>
column: "An Ecological Aspect Has Emerged in the Black Sea 
Fleet Division Problem. Damage by the Russian Navy Could Amount 
to 53 Billion Karbovanets a Year"] 
  [Text] The Ukraine Environment Protection Ministry has 
issued a report saying that $17.16 billion is required to clean 
up environmental pollution caused by Black Sea Fleet units 
located on Ukraine's territory. According to the ministry, in 
the Sevastopol bay alone vessels dump approximately 1,000 cubic 
meters of untreated sewage water every day. The main pollution 
source in the Sevastopol bay is a fuel tank. Underground 
waters, the soil, and the sea bed are contaminated. In some 
parts of the bay the depth of toxic deposits reaches 40 meters. 
  The Sevastopol bay is virtually dead. Approximately 30 
ships, as well as ammunition and spare parts, are lying at its 
bottom. One-third of the land occupied by fleet bases needs 
recultivation. The volume of contaminated underground waters is 
approximately four million cubic meters. In the event of the 
fleet's division in the proportions envisioned (18 percent of 
vessels to Ukraine and the rest to Russia), according to the 
Environmental Protection Ministry, the Ukraine Main Ecological 
Inspectorate, and the corresponding services of the Republic of 
Crimea and Sevastopol city, the environmental damage from the 
Russian Navy on Ukrainian territory will amount to 53 billion 
karbovanets a year. 
  The Ukrainian Environmental Protection Ministry has demanded 
that the ecological aspect of the problem be taken into 
consideration in sharing out the Black Sea Fleet because 
neutralizing the effects of the fleet's activity exceeds the 
cost of the fleet itself by three to three and a half times.

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Kudlicza: "It's Touch and Go </F>
with the Austrian Recyclers: Financial Crisis in Packaging 
Recycling"] 
  [Text] VDI-N, Vienna, 15 April 1994 - Six months 
after the Austrian packaging ordinance was put into effect, 
private industry's ARA collection and utilization system has 
become stuck in the same kind of difficulties as its German 
counterpart DSD (Dual System Deutschland) did earlier. 
Environmental Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat (Austrian People's 
Party) has been inundated with criticism both from the 
opposition parties as well as from the coalition party--the 
Socialist Party of Austria. Meanwhile, the "industrial branch 
recycling companies" are teetering precariously on the brink of 
bankruptcy. 
  The efficient use of packagings and the reuse of packaging 
waste, which today in Austria amounts to about 1.5 million tons, 
are the goals of the Austrian packaging ordinance. It obligates 
suppliers to take back the sales and transport packagings and 
either return them to the original supplier, reuse them, or 
otherwise utilize them. Businesses can free themselves from this 
obligation by concluding a license contract with Altstoff 
Recycling Austria AG (ARA) and paying a license fee. In exchange 
for which, ARA takes over the packaging waste materials and 
finds ways of utilizing them. 
  This initiative, under the motto "less government-more 
private industry," came under ideological crossfire almost 
immediately. The Social Democrats would prefer governmental 
regulation with a packaging duty rather than a system run by 
private industry. 
  The problems manifested themselves in early February. 
Austria 
Glass Recycling (AGR), an affiliate of ARA responsible for the 
collection of used glass products, found itself on the verge of 
financial collapse with a budgetary deficit of 70 million 
schillings. At the same time, ARA was already rumored to be 
threatened by a billion schilling deficit in its budget. The 
head of ARA, Christian Stiglitz, complained that "no one could 
realistically expect that a project like this, which in its 
first six months has undergone such growth, would be immune to 
some developmental disruptions." The development of the "Mega 
Project," he continued, has proceeded most promisingly to now. 
In just six months, some 6,000 companies throughout Austria have 
contracted with ARA. In the case of Germany, only 15,600 
contracts had been signed in three and a half years. 
  The first balance sheet, published on 1 March, showed a 
brisk 
income of about 2.2 billion schillings (DM 315 million), for 
1994. Another 300 million schillings are expected this year 
through the acquisition of new license partners, so that about 
2.5 million schillings instead of the originally planned 4 
million schillings, are available for collection and utilization 
purposes. 
  Christian Stiglitz asserts that the main reason for the 
"current income shortfall" is the large number of "free 
loaders," i.e., companies that take advantage of the ARA system 
without paying for it. Sharp action will now be taken against 
such companies. In cases where new cost estimates are the 
problem, rate charge restructuring will have to be considered. 
  In view of the crisis, Socialist Party member Josef Cap is 
demanding that "the packaging ordinance be lifted for an 
unspecified period of time so that the ARA can reexamine its 
operating conditions." As in Germany, the system is on the brink 
of bankruptcy because of inadequate control- and 
sanction-mechanisms. 
  Franz Floss believes that the present disposal system is not 
able to fulfill its own ecological intention of damming up the 
flood of waste. The spokesman of the Greens fears that the 
consumers will be called upon to make up for the losses. 
  On the other hand, Environmental Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat 
hopes that the ARA will be able to save some 700 million 
schillings (DM 100 million) through replanning. The difference 
remaining to close the 1.2 billion schilling deficit in the ARA 
balance--only 500 million schillings--could be realized through 
discounts and deferment of payments of the disposal operation 
(200 million schillings), advance payments and liability 
transfers to the economy (200 million schillings, and other 
similar measures taken by the cities and communities.

<F P=106> [`DW' report: "Hungary Sends Back Toxic Waste to Germany"] </F>
  [Text] Budapest -- Hungary is sending back to Germany toxic 
waste that was shipped there illegally by a German-Hungarian 
firm in June 1993. The waste stems from chemicals, paint 
residues, and other dangerous substances from a closed-down 
plant of the former GDR. After news of the illegal transport 
had been received, the approximate 200 tonnes of waste were 
placed in temporary storage in Hungary. It was said in Budapest 
that those responsible for the toxic waste scandal cannot be 
made answerable for it because the relevant legislation contains 
loopholes and the persons responsible have disappeared. The 
toxic waste, which Germany is getting back "after long talks," 
is to be handed over at the Austro-German border. Storage and 
transport costs amount to about 170,000 marks. 
  In 1993, Lower Saxony exported almost half its toxic waste 
to 
other German laender and abroad. Altogether, some 417,562 
tonnes of special waste were disposed of, said the general 
manager of the Lower Saxon Company for the Disposal of Special 
Waste, Schulze- Rickmann, yesterday. In addition, there were 
several hundred thousand tonnes of toxic waste that were 
disposed of by producers internally.

<F P=106> [Report by Reimund Westmeier: "New Laender Want To Build </F>
Their Own Satellite"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- The German Agency for Space Flight 
Affairs (Dara) wants to support the development and construction 
of a satellite by the new laender. The small satellite, called 
"NBL- Sat," is to be primarily used for gathering information on 
environmental damage in the new laender from space. Speaking at 
the ILA 94 international aerospace fair at Berlin-Schoenefeld on 
Saturday [28 May], Dara General Director Jan-Baldem Mennicken 
said that he envisages concentrating the resources available to 
eastern Germany on this project. 
  The plan is in line with Dara's goal of commercializing 
space 
flight and achieving the greatest possible benefits for the 
economy with the help of a state-subsidized space program, 
explained Mennicken. 
  Last year, Dara and the European space agency Esa provided 
52 
million German marks [DM] to the new laender, the sum being 
distributed among 29 industrial companies, 14 research 
institutions, and eight universities. The space budget for the 
new laender amounts to just DM80 million and is thus less than 
4.4 percent of the total budget, says Ralf Joachim, the head of 
the Dara coordination bureau. 
  Speaking to NEUE ZEIT, Klaus Berndt, head of space 
technology 
sales at the Jena-Optronik GmbH, said that with the NBL-Sat 
project, Dara has finally stopped applying "the principle of 
giving everyone a slice of the cake." With this new plan, which 
will involve the participation of nine eastern German space 
technology companies and institutes, Dara will be able to show 
something concrete and will have an opportunity to demonstrate 
that it is acting in the interest of the laender. Berndt 
stressed that the participation of eastern German companies in 
the satellite project would serve as a reference for them. 
There were no doubts in his mind about their competence with 
respect to space distance measuring and analysis technology, as 
well as optical sensors. To develop the new satellite, one 
will, of course, need the support of companies in the old 
laender, but know-how and technical means are abundantly 
available in eastern Germany. 
  Klaus Meyer, the executive director of the Freiberg Space 
Sensor GmbH, who initiated the project, assumes that the NBL-Sat 
project will use up about 50 percent of the space research 
funding available to the new laender. He expects the costs to 
reach a maximum of DM100 million over the next four years. The 
sum is tiny compared to the benefits to the environment. Thus, 
it might finally be possible to shed some light on radiation 
levels in Saxony's mining region. Meyer said that Saxony would 
have been able to launch such a small satellite project by 
itself if Dara had not become involved. However, with Dara 
participation, the use and benefits of such a satellite can be 
extended to all five new laender.

<F P=106> [Article by Birgitt Riese: "Disarmament in the Soil: </F>
Discarded Munitions Now Recognized as Environmental Hazard"] 
  [Text][First para is editor's summary] VDI-N, 
Duesseldorf--Over 7,000 sites in the Federal Republic are 
suspected of being polluted with weapons and munitions from two 
world wars and with toxins from military exercises. The road to 
cleaning them up is a long one--indeed, the authorities have 
only begun to find all the sites. There is a lack of tested 
methods for dealing with the poisoned inheritance. 
  Mustard gas, Tabun, Clark, phosgene: chemical weapons are a 
chapter of German history that is still far from being closed. 
"Munitions dumps in the Federal Republic were not recognized as 
an environmental problem until the 80's," as Andre Dahn of the 
BC Berlin Consult GmbH in Berlin recently explained at a 
professional meeting of the Offenbach environmental instititute. 
On 13 January 1993 the Federal Republic signed the international 
chemical weapons convention, which among other things also 
requires the destruction of chemical weapons. 
  But it is not only wars which left explosive traces in the 
soil. Over 1,000 Soviet army properties and almost 2,000 posts 
of the former National People's Army are heavily polluted with 
all kinds of military discards, such as munitions, kerosene and 
oil. NATO troop exercise locations which are to be used by 
civilians can be added to the list. 
  It took a long time for the Federal government to consider 
the legacy of two world wars. It was the end of 1993 before the 
Federal Environmental Department in Berlin (UBA) published a 
study in which sites in Germany suspected of having discarded 
munitions were included. The list gave 4,336 sites on which 
discards from munitions production or unsecured storage places 
for war material could be located. But the experts of the UBA 
are far from being able to say which materials are polluting the 
soil and the groundwater and to what degree. "The study is based 
on researches in archives and thus represents a purely 
historical and descriptive summary," as Manfred Kurka, expert 
advisor on suspected toxic waste sites, explains. 
  Some Federal Laender have launched their own initiatives in 
the meanwhile. In Lower Saxony, for example, an interagency task 
force set up by the Land government presented an initial survey 
as early as 1988. In mid-1989 the environmental agency in 
Hannover began systematic risk evaluation, investigating more 
than 400 suspected sites so far. The investigation itself 
involves four steps. Preliminary research provides initial data 
on the status of a possible munitions dump, including location, 
use and owners. In checking and documenting, archival materials, 
contemporary eyewitness reports, aerial photographs and 
geological conditions are consulted, interpreted and evaluated. 
Then in the preliminary investigation soil samples are taken and 
groundwater measurement locations are set up. The last step is 
the detailed investigation with increased sample density and 
more precise anaylses. The final result of the investigations is 
a status report which states the potential risk of a given site. 
  It turns out that in Lower Saxony the suspicion of toxic 
waste was not confirmed in about half of the sites. The other 
approximately 200 locations are more or less highly 
contaminated; further investigations are planned. For five 
suspicious sites it has been established that must be cleaned 
up, secured or at least watched. According to Hans- Juergen 
Rapsch, report leader for discarded munitions in the Lower 
Saxony department of the environment, the risk evaluation alone 
has cost the Land DM45 million so far. For the cleanup of 
particularly problematic sites costs in the hundreds of millions 
are anticipated. These are amounts which the Land cannot raise 
alone. "But the Union does not feel responsible for discarded 
munitions," Rapsch reports regretfully. A discarded munitions 
financing law drafted by Lower Saxony which had clearly been 
supported by the Federal Council died in the Bundestag at the 
beginning of 1993. It provided for the Union participating more 
in cleanup costs. 
  But financing is not the only problem. The question of how 
discarded munitions can be cleaned up at all has not yet been 
answered. Therefore, a model cleanup is to be carried out in 
Stadtallendorf in Hesse which will be supported by the Federal 
Research Department. At the site of the largest explosives 
factory in the Second World War the soil is contaminated with 
trinitrotoluene (TNT) and production chemicals. The Lurgi 
Environmental Participation Company GmbH in Frankfurt wants to 
use its Deconterra process, in which the soil is washed and the 
toxic concentrate is then burned. 
  But the project, which was started in 1990, is suffering 
delays. "The soil-washing plant probably cannot be started up 
until the beginning of 1996," says Birgit Hofmann, press 
spokeswoman in the Hessian department of the environment. She 
says that at the moment another hazard evaluation is being 
carried out for built-up parts of the area and a cleanup plan is 
being set up. 
  The investigation and evaluation of suspicious sites is to 
be 
facilitated by special computer programs. Thus the Industrial 
Plant Operating Company (IABG) in Ottobrunn has developed a 
model for the evaluation of hazards posed by military sites and 
discarded munitions (MAGMA). There is information stored in the 
data bank about 227 chemicals, particularly those specific to 
munitions. Both the toxicity of the substances and environmental 
factors like precipitation, flora and soil type enter into the 
evaluation. The result of the calculations is a socalled M value 
between one and ten, which expresses whether the potential 
hazard is small or a site must be treated urgently. MAGMA has 
been used so far to investigate suspicious sites on the former 
property of the western group of Soviet troops. At the moment, 
according to Hoppe, it is still in the programming phase, but 
within a few weeks it should be possible to install MAGMA in the 
computer. 
  Since March of 1993, in a project supported by the Federal 
Research Department at the former explosives factory at Tanne 
near Clausthal- Zellerfeld, the IABG has been investigating 
whether microorganisms can deal with TNT in the soil. The first 
result of the investigations is that bacteria present in the 
soil do metabolize TNT, but in the process they form substances 
which either have not yet been analyzed or are equally poisonous. 
  For most war material the only method so far has been 
burning. But so far there is only one plant for it. The military 
science department (WWD) of the Federal army in Munster has been 
running a two-chamber furnace since 1980 in which so far 75 tons 
of pure war material have been destroyed. Since the furnace only 
achieves temperatures up to 1200 degrees C, toxic arsenic is 
only inadequately bound. Thus a second furnace is planned, 
construction on which is to being this year, according to 
Hermann Martens, group leader in the WWD. This furnace is to 
operate according to the Swiss plasmox procedure. At 
temperatures up to 1600C, which are achieved with the help 
of an arc light, the arsenic-containing material vitrifies. 
Toxins are then washed out in such small quantities that 
according to Martens the slag can be used as a building material.

<F P=106> [Article: "Used Plastics Identified in Seconds"; </F>
Subhead: "Infrared Identification System Improves Recycling 
Quality in Automobile Recycling"] 
  [Text]Wiesbaden, 8 April 
1994 -- Whereas it is already possible to sort packaging 
plastics using detectors that operate in the infrared mid-range, 
so far rapid identification of the large number of engineering 
plastics has not been feasible. Black inked or highly filled 
types in particular have created problems. It has now been 
possible to resolve this problem under a joint project of the 
Development Group for the Recycling of Plastics [EWvK] in 
Wiesbaden together with Bavarian Motor Works [BMW] in Munich, 
plus the European Automobile Manufacturers' Joint Research 
Committee and Bruker Analytical Measurement Methods in Karlsruhe. 
  At the "Recycle '94" trade fair in Davos, 14-18 March, and 
at 
the 23-24 March annual meeting of the Association of German 
Engineers [VDI]-K [expansion not given] in Mannheim, the project 
partners demonstrated the new detection system for rapid 
identification of plastics. According to EWvK, it is possible 
with a rapidity measured in seconds to distinguish 23 different 
types of plastics and blends in all known modifications using 
the equipment developed by Bruker. To do so, it is necessary for 
only one second to hold the pieces needing identification to a 
measurement window and activate a foot switch. In three seconds 
the result shows up on the monitor. Prior processing of the 
pieces is only required if they are painted or underwent surface 
treatment. Removal of the paint using a finger milling-cutter or 
a conical pin-type milling-cutter, ranging over only a 10 
millimeter [mm] diameter, is sufficient prior preparation for 
the sampling. 
  Bruker's original piece of equipment has been undergoing 
testing for months at the BMW disassembly center in Landshut. 
According to EWvK, the experiments have gone so well that the 
sorting of the plastic pieces using disassembly manuals that has 
been performed until now in Landshut, has undergone replacement. 
The plastics are now separated by means of the identification 
system. Already during the test phase, there has been a definite 
decline in the contamination of pure sorts of materials through 
mis-sorting.

<F P=106> [Article by Michael Peter: "Werra and Weser </F>
Remain Salty"; Subheads: "Despite Production Breakthrough in 
Potash Industry Rivers Not Recovering as Much as Expected"; 
"Salt Load Supposed to Be Cut in Half Again by 1995"] 
  [Text]Duesseldorf, 8 April 1994 -- The Werra and Weser are 
supposed to become living rivers again. The production 
breakthrough in the Thuringian potash plants was only the first 
step along the way. The salt content of the rivers can be scaled 
back to a tolerable level by means of interim salt storage 
underground and modern production processes. 
  For a decade, Federal Republic of Germany [FRG] and German 
Democratic Republic [DDR] representatives negotiated over the 
introduction of salt into the Werra and Weser. Lower Saxony's 
environmental minister, Monika Griefahn, retrospectively sums up 
the failed endeavors: "The DDR authorities at that time simply 
were not interested in a solution." The change and production 
breakthrough in Thuringia's potash plants instantaneously 
yielded what politicians did not succeed in doing: the Werra and 
Weser will continue henceforth to be spared immense loads of 
salt. 
  In peak periods the Werra was twice as salty as the North 
Sea. In 1988, from second to second, 226 kilograms [kg] of 
chloride were still being introduced into the Werra, as attested 
by measurements at the Gerstungen water depth gauge. Since then, 
to be sure, the chloride load has diminished by about two 
thirds. But even this easing of the pollution is still not 
enough to establish even merely approximately ecologically 
wholesome conditions in the flow of the Werra and Weser rivers. 
Stephan von Keitz of the Hessian environmental ministry puts it 
clearly: "As long as there is a potash industry in Germany we 
will not be able to convert the Werra into a fresh water river." 
  In order to reduce the salt load to a tolerable amount and 
to 
keep the salt concentration constant, the laender bordering the 
Werra/Weser and federal environmental ministry are applying 70 
million German marks [DM] to finance the construction of 
temporary storage sites for saline solutions at the East German 
potash centers of Merkers and Unterbreizbach. On weekdays the 
reservoirs are filled with salt water that is flushed into the 
Werra on "salt-free" weekends. 
  Additionally, in the future underground storage of saline 
solutions in geological cavities of the dolomite slab is 
supposed to be used in Thuringia too. In Hesse the "subterranean 
bathtubs" are used as final storage sites for the saline 
effluents, whereas in Thuringia they are supposed to be used as 
temporary storage. If the Werra carries less water, the "tubs" 
are filled with saline solution. When more water is being 
carried the liquid effluent from the potash production is then 
pumped into the river. Hence the Werra in the final analysis is 
not spared a single ton of salt but the concentration of 
chloride can be kept constant. In this context, Juergen Hulsch, 
a water expert in the Lower Saxony environmental ministry, 
comments that the "buffering of the salt shocks" may often be 
more important for the Werra's and Weser's biosystem than the 
absolute salt load. 
  An attempt at temporary underground storage is supposed to 
begin this week. The appropriate Thuringian water authorities 
still have not granted approval. They are afraid that the 
drinking water will be put at risk by the temporary submersion. 
Earlier in Hesse, slightly salty, standing water showed up in 
the cavities at the surfaces where the saline effluents of the 
potash industry were submerged. 
  While only the salt concentration in the river can be kept 
constant using temporary storage, modern production processes 
make it possible to reduce the salt load much more effectively. 
Currently in Thuringia, potash (potassium chloride, KCl) is 
washed out. In a second wash cycle kieserite (magnesium sulfate) 
is separated from rock salt (NaCl). Hans-Joachim Scharf, an 
employee of Kali und Salz AG in Kassel explains: "Such washing 
of kieserite accounts for the accumulation of large quantities 
of saline effluents." The flotation process solves the salt 
separation much more elegantly: tiny air bubbles on the surfaces 
of the kieserite crystals give buoyancy to the kieserite. "It 
can be siphoned off as foam, while rock salt accumulates as 
solid residue and can be stockpiled," is Sharf's description of 
the process. 
  The flotation process common in West German potash plants is 
now also being applied in Thuringia. On the other hand, the 
situation is otherwise with the electrostatic raw salt 
separation process [ESTA] that Kali und Salz AG has been using 
for a long time in West Germany. In the mostly effluent-free 
ESTA process, the different electrostatic charge of the salt 
minerals contained in the raw salt is exploited. In the initial 
stage rock salt is separated from the other salt minerals. In 
subsequent stages kieserite is separated from potash. Alfred 
Heinz, a chemist and potash specialist in Thuringia's 
environmental ministry, believes that high costs account for the 
ESTA process not being used in Thuringia's potash plants. 
  Two-thirds less saline effluent results from the ESTA 
process. The other side of the coin is that the salt has to be 
stockpiled. According to Scharf, nearly 10 million tons [t] of 
waste salt were stockpiled in West Germany in 1992. Four million 
tons of salt were buried or introduced into the Werra. Clearing 
the stockpiles and compressing them back into the mines that 
have been worked is in fact possible and even done occasionally. 
According to Scharf, however, it is now universally feasible for 
economic reasons and would signal the end of potash production. 
The same argument applies to a solution proposed as early as the 
mid-seventies: creation of a salt-water pipeline from the Werra 
directly into the North Sea. 
  Actually, the international potash market is marked by 
overcapacity and declining earnings. Mining in the German pits 
is steadily waning: between 1988 and 1993 total German demand 
dropped from 5.8 million t of K2O to three million 
tons of K2O. Hence, more potash was produced in the 
GDR than the merger of Kali und Salz (west) and Mitteldeutsche 
Kali (east) is at present jointly producing. 
  Despite all the economic difficulties the endeavors of the 
laender bordering the Werra/Weser and the federation are 
pointing the way. Accordingly, the chloride presently being 
introduced into the Werra has to be reduced from nearly 70 
kilograms [kg]/second [s] to 40 kg/s by 1995. Over the medium 
term this value should be cut in half once more. In terms of 
concentration this signifies 2,500 milligrams [mg] of chloride 
per liter of water in the Werra at the Gerstungen water depth 
gauge in 1995. In this connection chloride is merely the 
principal parameter for analysis, the actual amount of salt 
totals nearly twice as much. 
  Federation and laender want to achieve a value of 500 
mg/liter [l] for the Weser. Hulsch emphasizes: "As a result we 
will get just below the threshold of biological disruption. That 
would be tremendous progress considering that the Weser has now 
been virtually dead." Still, even then the city of Bremen would 
not be able to derive any potable water from the Weser since, 
according to potable water guidelines, the chloride 
concentration is not allowed to exceed 200 mg/l.

<F P=106> [Article by Rainer Antkowiak: "North Sea on </F>
Verge of Nutrients Collapse"; Subhead: "Bordering Countries 
Still Have Hardly Reduced Their Nitrogen Inputs"] 
  [Text]Duesseldorf, 8 April 1994 --The North Sea is no 
longer supposed to be a catch basin for pollutants. In the past 
it was with statements of this kind that numerous conferences of 
North Sea border countries concluded. So far few deeds have 
ensued from the words. 
  "Although the situation has improved, the North Sea remains 
a 
major headache," openly admitted federal environmental minister, 
Klaus Toepfer, when he submitted his report on water management 
in Germany at the United Nations Water Day on 22 March in 
Noordwijk in the Netherlands. He thereby obliquely alluded to 
what environmental ministers have been asserting for a long 
time: resolutions by the North Sea border countries to halve 
their inputs of pollutants by 1995 relative to 1988, have so far 
entailed few effective measures. 
  With an average depth of only 80 meters [m], the shallow sea 
with the highest density of shipping in the world is forced to 
ingest large quantities of nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, 
organic halogen compounds and oils. According to the federal 
environmental ministry, statistically, 75 tons [t] of mercury, 
355 t of cadmium, 950 t of arsenic, 4,500 t of copper, 11,000 t 
of lead, 28,000 t of zinc, 50,000 t of phosphorus and as much as 
1.4 million t of nitrogen reach the North Sea annually via 
tributaries and via the air. More than one million tons of the 
nitrogen arrive directly via the rivers and nearly 400,000 t are 
airborne. 
  That is not without consequences. With increasing frequency, 
as a result of an oversupply of nutrients, it leads to algae 
blooms and oxygen deprivation. Ecosystems along the coasts are 
often disrupted. A study produced on commission from the 
environmental foundation World Wide Fund For Nature 
[WWF-Germany], "Nitrogen Inputs into the North Sea catchment 
Area," by the Hamburg Institute for Ecology and Policy 
[Oekopol], deals with the causes of the "overload of nitrogen" 
in the North Sea and measures for its reduction. Author Sabine 
Winteler emphasizes: "The report elucidates the manifold 
untapped scope and potential for a long overdue reduction of the 
turnover of nitrogen in the industry and industrial agronomy of 
the North Sea border countries." 
  Summarized briefly, the conclusions are: agriculture bears 
the responsibility for more than 50 percent and traffic for 
another 20 percent of the nitrogen pollution of the North Sea. 
Total inputs of nitrogen have remained steady at a high level 
for years. Only drastic measures can help the North Sea any 
longer. 
  The most important objective is refashioning agriculture 
into 
ecological farming. Toepfer takes a similar view in his report 
on water management in Germany: "Because of the largely closed 
cycle of materials ecological farming especially deserves 
support in problem areas for water management." He advocates 
designing subsidies and taxes in the agricultural sector more 
stringently than hitherto so as to support the goals of water 
protection. 
  The major sources of nitrogen from agriculture are animal 
production and soil cultivation. With the changeover to 
labor-saving mass ownership of animals there was more intensive 
use of liquefied disposal of manure. In Winteler's words: "The 
resulting liquid manure has a high content of rapidly available 
nutrients." More than 75 percent of the nitrogen from liquid 
manure is available to plants immediately or rapidly and 
therefore is capable of not being carried off into the North 
Sea. Lutz Ribbe, director of the environmental policy section 
Euronature, of the European Nature Heritage Foundation, remarks, 
however: "Only 20 percent of all fattened pigs in Germany are in 
hers of more than 400 animals." In the Netherlands and Great 
Britain by now 50 percent and 75 percent, respectively, of the 
swine are. 
  Manure activities outside the vegetation period are 
especially disastrous, leading to high losses of nitrates in the 
subsoil. Nitrates are hardly bound up there and mostly get into 
the ground water, the rivers and ultimately the North Sea. Not 
only the liquid manure but also the mineral fertilizers spread 
on the fields ultimately end up here. According to Winteler: "In 
1980 the amounts of artificial nitrogen , an average 130 
kilograms [kg] per hectare, applied in the former laender of the 
FRG were five times as much as before World War II." 
  Experts in the federal environmental ministry also are aware 
of how important a more economical use of fertilizers is. For a 
long time a bill has been lying dormant there for an ordinance 
on the use of fertilizer, that will prevent excessive use of 
fertilizer. Hardly anyone, however, expects it to be passed any 
longer in this term of the legislature. In any event, there was 
no word of mention about the ordinance in Toepfer's water 
management report at the end of March.

"Dioxin from Metallurgical Works: Industrial Facilities Seen as 
Dioxin Source"] 
  [Text] VDI-N, Duesseldorf, 15 April 94 - The dioxin 
question has taken on a new life. For years, waste incineration 
plants were branded the main source of such pollutants. Now iron 
and metal producers are being examined more closely. However, 
the mechanisms for dioxin formation are still not clear. 
  Although Dietrich Schulz, a staff member in the Berlin 
office 
of the German Federal Environmental Agency, has had a lot of 
experience with dioxins, he admits that "further surprises with 
dioxins cannot be excluded in the future" and that "we have 
consistently underestimated existing sources". No sooner is one 
dioxin source eliminated than another pops up. Last year the 
dioxin detectives, after first examining the waste incineration 
plants, then focussed their attention on sintering plants. The 
results of measurements far exceeded the worst expectations of 
the examiners. For example, the sintering plant of the 
Hoesch-Westphalia Works in Dortmund showed a dioxin value of 
43.2 ng pro m[.sup]3[/] of exhaust air. Another facility even 
recorded 70 ng/m[.sup]3[/]! By way of comparison, in 1990 the 
maximum value for dioxin emissions from new incineration plants 
was set at 0.1 ng/m[.sup]3[/]. 
  The dioxin values found in Dortmund not only alarmed the 
city 
residents but have also embroiled Klaus Matthiesen, the North 
Rhein Westphalian environmental minister, in the scandal. He 
apparently let these alarming measurement results gather dust in 
his office desk drawer for six months. His ministry had even 
sounded an all-clear in late December. The emissions from the 
Krupp Hoesch Plant were said not to constitute a health hazard 
to the residents in the area. Both blood and soil tests were 
said to indicate that the dioxins in Dortmund "did not exceed 
the general background level." 
  "We really cannot yet say what the reasons were for such 
surprisingly high dioxin values," Viktor Braun, spokesman for 
Krupp-Hoesch Stahl AG, confessed. The measurements had only 
recently been concluded and the results were still being 
evaluated. Meanwhile the burning of coke in the Dortmund 
sintering plant has been optimized, and the use of 
chlorine-containing top gas dust discontinued. Through the use 
of these measures, the emission values were reduced to the 
"normal measure" of from 2 to 4 ng/m[.sup]3[/] for such 
plants. Nonetheless, the enormous volume flow rates result in a 
troublesome yearly discharge volume. 
  Moreover, the measurements made in North Rhein-Westphalia 
led 
to a second, no less explosive, conclusion. The estimates of 
dioxin emissions, made in the former West Germany in the early 
1990's, have to be substantially corrected upwards. As Peter 
Bruckmann, director of the emissions surveillance board in the 
Duesseldorf Environmental Ministry, explained: "It must be 
concluded that the prescribed acceptable yearly amount of 1 kg 
has obviously been exceeded since our State-operated program 
alone has ascertained more than 500 g." This year, Bruckmann and 
his team will undertake the examination of chemical plants. 
Bruckmann, however, does not expect to encounter any bad 
surprises. "Usually chemical processes proceed without oxygen, 
thereby preventing the formation of dioxins," he explained. 
  On the other hand, household ovens and stoves are one of the 
greatest sources of dioxin. This has been confirmed by recent 
investigations made in Switzerland. Up to 114 ng/m[.sup]3[/] 
of dioxins have been detected in the exhausts from domestic 
heating fuels and the concomitant burning of household refuse. 
  While Schulz maintains that the current policy with regard 
to 
domestic heating fuels rests solely on appeals made to the good 
sense of the consumers, in the past other dioxin sources have 
been shut down or reduced by law. Thus, for example, the 
technical instructions with regard to the maintenance of pure 
air contain a general regulation on minimizing dioxin emissions. 
"In the case of organic substances, which are difficult to 
decompose but easily enriched and which are of high toxicity, 
the emission mass flow must, observing the principle of 
proportionality, be limited as far as possible." 
  Under the 1988 law regulating small heaters and stoves, 
wood, 
which has been treated with a protective agent or coated with a 
halogen-organic compound, cannot be burned. The emission limit 
value for dioxins and furans was set at 0.1 ng/m[.sup]3[/] in 
the 17th ordinance of the 1990 German Federal Emissions Law. It 
is hoped that by the end of 1996 the dioxin discharge from such 
units will be reduced from the yearly 400 g recorded in 1988 to 
4 g a year. 
  In addition, the Scavenger Ban of 1992, forbade the use of 
chlorine- or bromine-containing additives in gasoline containing 
lead. Furthermore, since 1989 the production of 
pentachlorophenol and consumer products containing polychlorided 
biphenyls has been forbidden. 
  However, the policy has not yet set any strict regulations 
in 
this regard for the steel industry. To be sure, in April 1993 a 
working group of the State Committee for Emissions Protection 
strongly advocated a target value of 0.1 ng/m[.sup]3[/] for 
industrial plants as well. Klaus Toepfer, the German Minister 
for Environmental Affairs, and his State counterparts have so 
far not reacted. It is very clear, however, that the dioxin 
discharge from industrial plants has to be reduced. From the 
health point of view, the precautionary value for the daily 
dioxin intake, which the Federal Health Department has set at 
0.1 picograms (trillionth of a gram) per kg of body weight, has, 
according to Federal Environmental Agency data, been exceeded by 
a factor of two in Germany. 
  The dioxin debate now revolves around the alternative target 
value or fixed limiting value as in the case of waste 
incineration plants. Claus Meyer-Wulf of the Kayser AG 
Metallurgical Works suspects that in future practice the 
permissible dioxin emission will be decided by testing 
individual cases. But Lower Saxony has already decided 
differently. In December 1993, a decree directed at the 
industrial and trade sector set a limiting value of 0.1 
ng/m[.sup]3[/]. The industrial oversight offices were ordered 
to investigate suspect plants for their dioxin emissions. A 
spokesman in the Lower Saxony ministry said: "We are only 
requiring what is possible on the basis of the state of the 
technology and the minimization ordinance, in other words, what 
is technically and economically possible." 
  Since the unusually high values have become known, an 
intensive search has been underway in the Dortmund plant for the 
dioxin sources. Fine ore has been baked together with coke and 
lime in the sintering plant at about 1200 to a cake, then 
broken up again and smelted in the pig iron blast furnace. 
Sintering plants have the additional function as a recycler of 
residual and recirculating materials from rolling mills and 
steel-processing plants. 
  It is quite possible to reduce the dioxins in sintering 
plants. Guenter Ziegenbalk of Kloeckner Stahl GmbH in Bremen can 
demonstrate that in his iron ore sintering plant. In Bremen, 
they focus, first of all, on minimizing dust emissions by means 
of a double filter. As a desirable side effect, the dioxin 
discharge fell off by two-thirds to 2.2 ng/m[.sup]3[/]. This 
year the value will be pushed further down beneath the 1 
ng/[.sup]3[/] mark through the use of hearth incinerator 
coke. Finally, the Bremen team hopes to undercut the limit value 
for waste incineration plants further by means of exhaust gas 
recirculation techniques. 
  Of course measures to protect the environment cost money. 
Investments in woven filters in the Kloeckner Steel Works in 
Bremen now run to DM16 million. The exhaust gas recirculation 
techniques will cost about the same amount. The Ministry for the 
Environment in Bonn is sharing the costs of these pilot plants. 
  Meyer-Wulf is also appealing to the politicians to examine 
the problem of dioxin reduction themselves. To date, Meyer-Wulf 
asserts, there are no ready-made, technically perfected 
solutions. Each plant requires its own solution which, in turn, 
means that the costs are high. And, finally, it must be stated 
that high dioxin discharges from sintering plants are not a 
problem that is unique to North Rhein-Westphalia or Germany. 
  According to data provided by Dr. Uwe Lahl, senator for 
environmental protection in Bremen, about 40 sintering plants 
are now in operation in West Europe, of which only 14 are in 
Germany. Lahl notes further that very little is known about the 
plants in other European countries, some of which are much older 
than those in Germany.

  [Text]VDI-N, Duesseldorf, cf--Cars are to become 
cleaner. Last Tuesday the Council of the European Union passed 
the new guidelines on lowering the permissible exhaust gas 
levels for motor vehicles. The permissible emissions will be 
lowered in three stages. In the first stage the catalytic 
convertor became compulsory for new cars throughout Europe last 
year. The second stage will come into force in 1996. For new 
cars it will reduce the emission of hydrocarbons and nitric 
oxides by an additional 56 percent (gas engines) or 38 percent 
(diesel engines), of carbon monoxide by 39 percent and 68 
percent respectively, of particles by 56 percent. For the third 
stage, starting from the year 2000, the EU commission wants to 
suggest maximum values by the end of the year. "The automobile 
industry will received criteria for their development plans in 
plenty of time," commented Federal secretary of the environment 
Klaus Toepfer. 
  The European Parliament had demanded stricter limiting 
values 
and had also suggested interposing another stage starting in 
1998. The members of parliament spoke particularly strongly 
about there being separate limiting values for hydrocarbons and 
nitric oxides. But when it came to a vote there was not a 
majority in support of the proposals for change.

<F P=106> [Article by Juergen Siebenlist: "DSD Waste Becomes </F>
Chemical Raw Material Source"] 
  [Text]VDI-N, Cologne--The decision about utilizing used 
plastic packaging from the "Yellow Sack" of Dual System Germany 
(DSD) in Cologne for raw materials has been made. On 16 March 
the board of directors of the DKR Company for Plastics Recycling 
in Cologne authorized management to negotiate contracts with the 
companies BASF/Otto, RWE and VEW/KAB for the construction and 
running of recycling plants with an annual capacity of up to 
500,000 tons. 
  The head of the BASF plastics division, member of the board 
Dr. Albrecht Eckell, considered this decision to be an "approved 
surcharge" for his company's raw material recycling plan. For a 
consortium made up of BASF AG in Ludwigshafen and Otto Plastics 
Service GmbH in Heidelberg has made DKR an offer to utilize the 
materials of 300,000 tons of used polymers annually starting in 
1996. 
  At the moment BASF is constructing a suitable pilot plant in 
Ludwigshafen to transform mixed and soiled plastic waste into 
reusable petrochemical raw materials. The resulting distillates 
are naphtha, olefins and aromatics, which are used as on-site 
materials within the investment group. According to Eckell, loss 
of quality does not occur as it does in the case of working 
material recycling (plastic wastes are made into plastics again). 
  The BASF board member sees raw material recycling as an 
ecologically and economically sensible alternative for 
utilization. For he says that "disproportionately many 
resources" are used in the recycling of working materials for 
packaging marked with the Green Dot. "Collecting, sorting and 
cleaning require an unreasonably high level of energy, water and 
costs," says Dr. Albrecht Eckell, "which cannot be justified 
ecologically or economically." 
  These problems are also reflected in the new licensing 
compensation structure for the "Green Dot," which was agreed on 
by the DSD board of directors on 21 March. It stipulates, for 
example, that from 1 October an additional DM2.95 per kg is to 
be paid to Dual System for plastic containers over a base amount 
defined by number and volume. 
  This means that the timing would be precisely right for raw 
material recycling as a brake on costs. For according to Dr. 
Albrecht Eckell the reduction of the total utilization costs for 
plastics is a particular concern of the plastics industry. Of 
the present high costs of about DM3,000 per ton for recycling in 
Dual System, about 80 percent can be traced to expensive 
collecting and sorting, he said. But with raw material recycling 
that could largely be dispensed with. Achievable exploitation of 
the material is given by the BASF plastics expert as 85 to 95 
percent. Says Eckell: "This makes raw material recycling-- 
contrary to a common prejudice--an efficient kind of 
utilization." 
  In addition, the goals of the packaging ordinance, which are 
ambitious in the opinion of BASF--according to current 
interpretation, from 1 July 1995 approximately 600,000 tons of 
private commercial packaging must be collected, sorted and 
materially reused by DSD--can only be met, according to Dr. 
Albrecht Eckell, with the help of raw material recycling. In 
this way 300,000 tons of DSD material could be recycled annually 
from mid-1996. 
  For plastics recycling on a major technological scale BASF 
needs an additional surcharge of about DM350 per ton and, 
according to Eckell, "stable framework conditions." Among these 
he includes permanent exemption from the requirement for plastic 
packaging to be returnable in the marketplace. 
  Wolfram Brueck is confident that the DKR's decision marks a 
great step forward in this regard also. "There is no more reason 
to set a time limit on exemption for plastics through the Land 
departments," says the DSD managing director. 
  But more than one plant is needed for comprehensive 
utilization of the used plastic packaging created in Germany. In 
the view of BASF board member Eckell, only through the 
construction of additional utilization facilities by other 
companies can the goal of keeping dumps free of plastics be 
reached. As an example he cited Veba Oel AG, which hopes to 
transform 120,000 tons of used plastics annually into a 
synthetic oil in the coal/oil plant in Bottrop starting in 1996. 
He also listed RWE's plan to use 70,000 tons of used plastics 
annually in the production of synthesis gas.

<F P=106> [Article by Gerd Trommer: "A Second Life for Old </F>
Plastics: VDI-North Baden Palatine Learns About Plastics 
Recycling"] 
  [Text][First para is editor's summary] VDI-N, 
Mannheim--Members of the district association for North 
Baden-Palatinate viewed the new plastics reprocessing center of 
the BASF in Ludwigshafen. Here methods for reprocessing plastic 
wastes are tested. 
  That plastic is neither a totally artifical nor a completely 
new material was discovered by the visitors from North Baden and 
the Palatinate at BASF. For example, the resin with which 
Pharoah Rameses, 1301-1234 B.C., was mummified corresponds 
chemically to a modern plastic. By now plastics have become the 
number one material in the world. Every year about 100 million 
tons are used. 
  This amount also accounts for the necessity for 
environmentally friendly reuse or disposal. The plan of the 
German plastics industry anticipates putting emphasis on waste 
avoidance, material recycling (for the working materials) and 
chemical reuse (for the raw material). Thus dumping and burning 
are "out" as direct methods of disposal. Working material 
recycling means the direct refashioning of used plastics into 
new products; in the opinion of plastics producers, it 
represents the correct solution, if raw materials, energy and 
costs can be saved in that way. 
  In contrast, raw material recycling means the reseparation 
of 
plastic materials into chemical or petrochemical raw materials. 
The chemical industry regards it as the proper procedure, 
especially for the reuse of used plastic packaging. Processes in 
use at the moment include pyrolysis, hydrogenation and chemical 
separation. 
  Investments in the plant technology alone for the new 
plastics reprocessing center of the BASF add up to DM3 million. 
The process technologists want to develop "recipes" for working 
material recycling of plastics. About 15 to 20 percent of used 
plastics would be able to gain a second life in Germany by this 
means alone, as long as the materials in question are remeltable 
thermoplasts. Indeed, these represent about 80 percent of the 
world's plastics. 
  In contrast to the melting down of metals, impurities or 
admixtures represent a significant hurdle for plastics. For 
instance, if all organic impurities are incinerated during metal 
melting processes, that is not to be expected at temperatures 
between 100 and 300C for plastics. Thus a prerequisite for 
the reprocessing of working materials is clean, perfectly 
sorted, extrudable plastic wastes with no noxious materials. The 
engineers of VDI saw on the spot how they are produced at the 
technical school. Three plant blocks with a total of 20 stations 
are available. Saws, chopping blades, mills or special grinders 
of various kinds transform the plastic parts into granules. 
Separation of metal parts, filtering of waste air and sound 
protection take place in parallel. Either dry separation or wet 
reprocessing follows. Next come sifting arrangements, magnetic 
separators, gravity and air separation procedures or alternative 
or additional washing processes, sorting in a water bath using 
flotation or sinking, and finally drying processes. 
  A particular value is placed on environmentally friendly 
disposal of all the remnants and toxins which come along with 
the plastic parts, e.g. oils, brake fluids and other impurities. 
At the moment the plant accepts throughput of 50 to 500 kg per 
hour in single-shift operation. The individual stations can be 
linked by process control and material transport arrangements. 
  Work and experience in the technical school are also 
intended 
to give information about which cycles and combinations can 
assure disposal on a scale suitable for major industries using 
economic and ecological criteria. "Chemistry is doing its 
homework now; and the cycles will soon be closed," says Prof. 
Anton Weber of the BASF, viewing the future with optimism. After 
viewing the new technical school, the chairman of the VDI, Dr. 
Heinz Mueller, noted with pleasure that the prevailing opinion 
within the chemical industry had changed: "If a year ago thermal 
reprocessing was as it were the only possibility, we welcome the 
fact that the chemical industry now values recycling with its 
alternatives for working materials and raw materials!"

  [Text] VDI-N,Duesseldorf--The quality of the 
groundwater is threatened to an alarming degree by toxins. 
Measures such as water protection areas are no longer adequate 
for protection against oil, halogen compounds, nitrates and 
pesticides. Numerous sources of toxins are unknown. This is the 
conclusion of the Bureau for Evaluation of Technology Effects 
(TAB) in the German Bundestag in the recently published report 
"Groundwater Protection and Water Maintenance." 
  About 70 percent of the drinking water in Germany is 
obtained 
from groundwater. In the last two decades it has become clear 
that the buffering and filtering capacity of the soil is no 
longer adequate to block out the multitude of toxins. The 
purifying powers of the groundwater itself are small; 
impurities, once introduced, are difficult or impossible to 
eliminate. 
  Protection of the groundwater through the designation of 
water protection areas is welcomed by the TAB in principle, but 
the bureau points out that according to statements by the 
Federal government about 50 percent of the necessary water 
protection areas have been planned, but not yet designated. In 
addition, so many toxins are introduced through the air that 
many groundwater protection aras had to be given up. 
  It is true that industry, agriculture and transportation are 
known as general sources of toxins, but it is rarely possible to 
assign a substance to its specific cause. For example, the 
construction industry is a sector with many unknowns: according 
to the TAB report more and more chemicals are being used whose 
effect on the environment has been investigated only very 
inadequately. 
  The TAB demands instead that the water be protected from 
toxins over its whole cycle. "Groundwater-endangering products 
and production processes should be more expensive," is one 
recommendation. In order to reduce the introduction of nitrogen, 
the experts recommend a price increase for fertilizers through a 
nitrogen tax which is to be paid by the manufacturers or 
importers of fertilizer. 
  The TAB has investigated the building industry more closely 
as a source of toxins. Construction sites could have a "toxin 
mortgage" imposed on them, which is used to cover the costs of 
cleanup during demolition. This would mean that the building 
contractor would already have an incentive to use building 
materials which are reusable and low in toxins. In addition, the 
TAB believes that it would be thinkable to introduce a use tax 
for chemical components, since in most cases the producers of 
the components are responsible for the creation of toxic wastes.

<F P=106> Environmental Minister Toepfer Opens First </F>
German Plastics Hydrogenation Facility in Bottrop 
  [TEXT]Bottrop--With a symbolic push of the button, on 
April 12th in Bottrop the Minister for the Environment Prof. Dr. 
Klaus Toepfer set in operation the first commercial installation 
for recycling plastic packaging as raw material. For Dr. 
Eberhard von Perfall, as CEO of Ruhrkohl Umwelt GmbH in Essen, 
this was the realization of a "dream of true recycling": 32,000 
metric tons of synthetic oil will now be produced from 40,000 
metric tons of mixed plastic waste annually. 
  Two years ago Wolfram Brueck was happy that the operators of 
the Bottrop coal-oil facility (KAB) were able to show him a way 
out of the terrible dilemma of waste disposal of mixed plastic 
waste. This was because the Managing Director of Dual Systems 
Deutschland (DSD) in Cologne did not find in the plastics 
industry nearly the recycling capacity urgently needed for 
long-term compliance with the recycling quotas set by the 
legislature. With the start of using plastic as raw material in 
Bottrop, he can now believe in a change. Since the beginning of 
the year, the KAB has been changing polymer packaging waste back 
into syncrude [synthetic crude oil]--a recycling product which 
is scarcely distinguishable from light mineral oil and can be 
used again without loss in quality as a high-grade oil refinery 
product. 
  Eight hundred kg of oil are produced from one metric ton of 
mixed plastic, according to the estimate of the current 
facility's level of efficiency in processing material made by 
Dr. Eberhard von Perfall to the guests at the official start of 
operations on April 12th. At the same time, the CEO of Ruhrkohle 
Umwelt GmbH in Essen, which operates the facility together with 
Veba Oil AG, Gelsenkirchen, stressed the great gain in energy. 
He claims that only about 10% of the energy content (in 
terms 
of the energy which would be released if the plastic waste were 
incinerated) is lost though hydrogenation. 
  "We are not in essence entering new territory here," said 
Dr. 
Hubert Heneka referring to the already tested technique. 
According to the President and CEO of Veba Oil AG, a technique 
which has been refined over decades is being used to solve a 
current waste problem: the reconversion of used packing plastic 
back into the original oil components. Using the modified 
Bergius Pier process, from 1981 to 1987 the KAB already 
converted around 250,000 metric tons of hard coal into liquid 
products. After coal hydrogenation could no longer be continued 
for economic reasons, the operators modified the facility for 
hydrogenation of petroleum residue using the Veba-Combi-Cracking 
process(VCC). In 1991 authorization for processing used waste 
oil, used solvents, and varnish or paint sludge was broadened to 
include the recycling of materials containing PCP. 
  In April of 1992 the recycling of plastic waste was at last 
at hand. The insensitivity of the VCC process toward the content 
of the material involved was the technical prerequisite [for 
this to work], the pressure for recycling coming from the 
government's packing guidelines was the economic prerequisite. A 
major trial which was carried out at that time in which for the 
first time 60 metric tons of plastic waste was hydrogenated 
together with heavy petroleum residue confirmed the basic 
suitability of the process. But according to Heneka, it also 
made it clear that procedural steps developed for coal 
hydrogenation were too expensive for industrial recycling of 
plastic waste. Therefore an primary system had to be 
conceptualized and made, by means of which the polymers supplied 
as granular material are transferred as a fluid permitting them 
to be pumped together with the petroleum residue into the 
hydrogenation section. Heneka: "It is only this newly developed 
step in the process, the depolymerization, which now satisfies 
the requirement of recycling five metric tons per hour on a 
continuous basis." 
  After 12 months under construction, the expanded facility 
with a total annual capacity of around 200,000 metric tons was 
ready for operation to recycle 40,000 metric tons of waste 
plastic per year. Operators had invested around 20 million 
German marks in modifications of the KAB, particularly in the 
core of the plastic preparation process, the depolymerization 
reactor. 
  Here, completely cut off from the external world, the large 
plastic molecules are thermally split at temperatures of 350 to 
400C, so that they can be pumped without problem along with 
vacuum residue, additives and hydrogen into the actual 
hydrogenation system. 
  In the hydrogenation reactor, syncrude (synthetic crude 
oil), 
hydrocarbon gas and hydrogenated bitumen are produced at a 
processing pressure of 300 bar and [a temperature of] 470C. 
The hydrochloric acid released from the PVC during 
depolimerization is reclaimed as liquid hydrochloric acid in an 
auxiliary system and handed over marketing. 
  A pipeline directly links the KAB with the nearby [oil 
refinery of] Ruhroel-Raffinerie in Scholven. In conjunction with 
the Kokerei Prosper [coke-oven plant], the delivery of the 
product as well as the service of the facility is thus 
efficiently assured. 
  Still, the KAB operators have not yet passed the break-even 
point in plastic waste recycling. With an annual throughput of 
40,000 metric tons of plastic waste, the syncrude produced in 
the Bottrop hydrogenation plant is about three to four times as 
expensive as comparable crude oil on the Rotterdam market. Dr. 
Hubert Heneka: "We currently need a turnover of around 800 GM 
[German marks] per metric ton. But we want to take the offensive 
in this business and ensure for ourselves a large share of the 
market in plastic waste recycling." The speaker from Veba Oil 
hopes to be able to cut costs in half if the legal requirements 
for expanding the capacity can be managed quickly with the city 
of Bottrop. Presuming that a rapid agreement can be reached, an 
annual capacity of 120,000 metric tons for recycling of plastic 
as a raw material would already be available in 1995. 
  But Kurt Schmitz, the mayor of the urban district of 
Bottrop, 
"has trouble imagining" at this time an expansion of the 
facility. Substantial problems with acceptance already had to be 
overcome when the KAB first began [working with] the disposal of 
problem waste. 
  Through the contributions made by DSD in recycling, the 
process today is, however, already paying off for the operators: 
according to the words of its managing director Wolfram Brueck, 
Dual System Deutschland currently pays 757 German marks per 
metric ton of plastic delivered for recycling in Bottrop. The 
common goal is to make it economically competitive with 
incineration. 
  Environmental Minister Toepfer, who put the incineration 
costs at around 500 marks per metric ton at this time in 
Germany, was convinced at the official start-up of recycling 
plastic as raw material in Bottrop: "The horrific numbers of the 
high utilization costs are gradually becoming a thing of the 
past."

<F P=106> Tests Find Heavy Metal Content </F>
  [TEXT]Duesseldorf. The Elbe is supposed to be made 
clean again. According to new tests, the river has actually been 
spared much pollution since the [political changes in 1989], but 
over the years high levels of heavy metals and organic 
contaminants have collected in the sediment of the Elbe and its 
tributaries. 
  At 1,165 km in length and up to nine km in width [in some 
places] with a average current of 710 m[.sup]3[/] of water 
per second, the Elbe is one of the largest rivers in Europe. But 
at the same time, it is also one of the dirtiest: the Elbe is 
highly polluted and in some stretches ecologically destroyed. 
Around 7.6 million people in the nine German states either 
permanently or for long periods of time receive drinking water 
which does not meet the requirements of the European Union (EU) 
and the drinking water regulations. 
  Germany, the Czech Republic and the EU under the roof of the 
International Commission for the Protection of the Elbe (IKSE) 
already joined together years ago to save the Elbe. By 1995 
pollution of the Elbe and her tributaries is supposed to be 
substantially reduced, and a clear improvement in the water 
quality up to grade II ("moderately polluted") is supposed to 
have been reached. 
  Moreover, the Ministry of Research and Technology has also 
taken on the Elbe and her tributaries with its "Elbe 2000" 
project. The goal: to win back stretches of the river as 
renaturalized river meadows left to nature. By the year 2000 the 
pollution of the Elbe should have been reduced to such an extent 
that, according to the BMFT, "the basis [will have been created] 
for a water system which can be used in an ecologically 
balanced, sensible manner in harmony with nature." The BMFT has 
made 61 million German marks available, and all investigations 
by the "Elbe Research" working group of the International 
Commission for the Protection of the Elbe (IKSE) are being 
coordinated. 
  The numerous factory shut-downs after the political upheaval 
have done the Elbe good. She carried less ammonium and mercury 
in 1993 than in 1985, but more chlorinated hydrocarbons. 
According to tests by the Elbe's water quality station in 
Schnackenberg, the amount of ammonium sank from 54,000 metric 
tons in 1985 to 7,700 metric tons in 1992 and to 6,900 metric 
tons in 1993. The amount of mercury dropped from 28 metric tons 
in 1985 to 4.2 in 1992 and 1.9 in 1993. 
  In contrast, pollution of the Elbe from chlorinated 
hydrocarbons climbed in 1993 to 1985 levels. Last year the 
concentrations of beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, a waste product in 
the production of the insecticide Lindane, were at 110 kg far 
higher than the 1985 level of 85 kg. According to Hamburg's 
senator for the environment Fritz Vahrenholt, it is suspected 
that the pollution can be traced back to illegal dumping. 
  In the meantime the first results of the joint "Elbe 
Tributaries" project are available. They show "that a persistent 
improvement in the Elbe's water quality is only possible if at 
least the large main tributaries are included in the clean-up 
measures," since it is through them that much of the pollution 
gets into the river, especially the heavy metals. 
  Scientists are particularly directing their attention to the 
heavy metal contamination of the sediment, since this can be 
determined not only at certain points but can also be followed 
along downstream. Sediment provides a "long-term memory" which 
mirrors for a longer period of time the accumulation of 
suspended materials. 
  The fine grain fraction with a granulation of up to 0.02 mm 
is being studied, because it corresponds to the suspended 
material transported in water which, because of its grain 
fineness, has a high bonding cability with heavy metals and 
numerous organic pollutants, and [thus] accumulates them. The 
natural (geologic) heavy metal concentration is used as a 
reference base: values at the level of this geologic 
concentration correspond to class zero ("unpolluted"), and each 
doubling of the values means a move to a new classification. 
  The analyses show that the sediment in the basin near 
Leipzig 
is "heavily polluted" (class four) with cadmium. The scientists 
also found arsenic and lead in high concentrations: in Muenzbach 
near Freiberg sediment was sampled which contained a class seven 
(extremely polluted) level of arsenic concentration. The 
researchers trace this back to the steel and iron industry 
there, which is also responsible for the high levels of lead. 
Nickel was found in the sediment beneath the Aue nickel plant at 
levels up to class five ("heavily to excessively polluted"). 
  At the lower reaches of the Joint Basin east of Bitterfeld 
lies the man-made Muldenstein lake which at the beginning of the 
sixties was laid out in a former brown coal opencast mining 
area. As it turned out, the [lake] forms a sediment trap, as the 
sediment brought in from the basin had accumulated here in a 
layer averaging about 30 cm high. In all, the researchers 
calculated that about 25,000 metric tons per year accumulate in 
the sediment of the artificial lake, or about 400,000 metric 
tons since its flooding. It contains about 1,030 metric tons of 
zinc, 114 metric tons of lead, 101 metric tons arsenic, 98 
metric tons copper, 71 metric tons chromium, 43 metric tons 
nickel, 32 metric tons cadmium and about 1 metric ton of 
mercury. The uranium level is estimated to be 50 to 70 metric 
tons. Accumulation in the basin constitutes a serious potential 
danger, since if it is stirred up again and comes in contact 
with oxygen, the highly toxic cadmium in particular can become 
mobilized and pass into the food chain or the ground water. 
  Keeping the public's drinking water safe is, according to 
the 
BMFT, an urgent goal, since the nine German states, which in 
great part constitute areas of water shortage, will even in the 
future not be able to dispense with obtaining drinking water 
from the bank filtrate of the Elbe. Therefore, four pilot or 
demonstration facilities for obtaining drinking water from bank 
filtrate or from the ground water in the Elbe's drainage area 
have been being funded since 1990. It is also being studied here 
whether using activated carbon filters can make it easier to 
obtain drinking water from heavily polluted bank filtrate.

<F P=106> Liquid Absorption Lowers Emissions from </F>
Industrial and Waste Incinerators 
  [TEXT]Duesseldorf. 
How cleanly an industrial or waste incinerator plant operates 
depends first and foremost on the scrubbing of the flue gas. A 
process tested in Switzerland offers an economical and effective 
alternative. 
  Requirements regarding the effectiveness of clean-ups have 
increased a great deal since the eighties, the last significant 
milestone up to now is the 17th Regulation in the Federal 
Emission Protection Law, which since 1990 has drastically 
lowered the permissible levels for heavy metals, dioxins and 
furans in new waste incinerator plants. Because of their size 
and cost, modern facilities for cleaning waste gas are scarcely 
distinguishable from the actual production or incineration units. 
  A process for liquid absorption tested in Switzerland meets 
legal standards for separation efficiency and also promises 
substantial advantages with respect to investment and operating 
costs. The principle is simple: an alkaline washing solution is 
sprayed at high speed into the reaction compartment (absorber) 
and turned by the turbulence into tiny droplets which form a 
high surface area for reactions with the materials contained in 
the flue gas. The mostly acidic components of the flue gas are 
neutralized, the used washing solution is captured. A partial 
stream from this is replaced with calcium hydroxide or calcium 
chloride, the resulting calcium salts are filtered off and 
dried, the regenerated washing solution can then be sprayed back 
into the absorber again. 
  The fundamental difference compared to conventional flue gas 
scrubbing procedures is: the liquid absorption does not work on 
the countercurrent principle, but instead the opposing stream of 
gas and liquid is maintained, the gas scrubbing does however 
occur in an horizontally placed washer. This technique permits a 
connection in series of several absorption stages and thus a 
reduction of the respective concentrations of pollutant in the 
waste gas [at each stage]. 
  "In principle it is suitable for nearly all combustion 
processes," according to the inventor and patent holder Johann 
Renneberg, director of Renneberg Engineering Consulting in 
Neckargmuend. It is, however, especially suited for use with 
waste gases which are heavily contaminated with sulphur and 
chlorine. Test runs in the special waste incineration plant in 
the Swiss [town of] Hausen near Brugg had already yielded 
astonishing conclusions by the end of the seventies. According 
to measurements taken by the Federal Materials Testing and 
Experimental Institute (EMPT) it was possible to separate 
99.9% 
of the sulphur dioxide (SO[.sub]2[/]), 99.9% of the hydrogen 
chloride (HCl) and 99.9% of the hydrogen fluoride (HF). 
The 
results in a incineration plant built in Stuttgart were also 
convincing. According to Renneberg it was possible to reduce the 
HCl concentration from around 30 g per m[.sup]3[/] to 7 to 11 
mg/m[.sup]3[/]. 
  The alkaline components of the washing solution also react 
with the nitrogen oxides (NO[.sub]x[/]), carbon monoxide 
(CO), and even carbon dioxide (CO[.sub]2[/]). NO[.sub]x[/] 
is converted to 92%, CO to 50% and CO[.sub]2[/] to 15%. 

But Renneberg was also concerned about the separation of dioxins 
and furans. According to his thinking, the washing solution 
could be sprayed in together with suspended activated charcoal, 
which picks up dioxins and furans. 
  Since a separate NO[.sub]x[/] reduction step and a 
downstream activated charcoal filter can be dispensed with, 
liquid absorption saves money. According to Renneberg, the 
investment and operating costs can also be kept low through the 
simple construction of the absorber, the small space requirement 
and the recovery of the washing solution. Compared to 
conventional flue gas scrubbing methods, he figures on 
investment costs which are 20% to 30% lower, 
operating costs 
15% to 25% lower. 
  There is, however, a tinge of bitterness: since the 
development of the process at the end of the seventies, none of 
the financially strong installation builders has shown any 
interest in a co-production. At the beginning of the eighties, 
the interest in more effective processes for flue gas scrubbing 
was weak, since at that time the Standards for Technical 
Instructions for Air [Treatment] did not yet exist. And today? 
"The market in Germany is firmly in the hands of a few large 
companies," Renneberg summarizes his experience: "new and 
cost-efficient development has hardly any chance." 
  He is now turning his hopes toward the USA. The Epri 
Institute in San Francisco is now carrying out an 
analysis--commissioned by the government--of current techniques 
for cleaning waste gas. Renneberg will introduce his process 
there. "Then perhaps it will make its way back to Germany again."

  [TEXT]The environment and ecology are in spite 
of the economic crisis firmly lodged in the consciousness of 
broad sections of the German public. On an ecology consciousness 
scale of one to ten, Germans had the high score of 7.8. Eighty 
percent of Germans claim that they contribute to environmental 
protection through their own behavior and that they are willing 
to buy environmentally friendly products. But only half of them 
are willing to spend more money to do so. In fact, 80% 
reject 
higher gas prices, according to a poll taken by the research 
institute of Axel Billig &amp; Partner in Cologne and 
commissioned 
by the Berlin Office of the Environment. 
  The ecologically aware person has become a statistical norm, 
environmental consciousness is no longer dependent on age, sex 
or education. Yet in spite of the pronounced ecological 
awareness of the Germans, individual behavior meets its 
limitations when it comes to [imposing] personal restrictions. 
Thus, over half of the respondents were ready to dispose of 
batteries separately or to buy energy saving appliances, but 
every second person rejected higher prices for environmentally 
friendly products. Fewer than 20% would limit their 
driving and 
only 12% would keep the heat lower. For 15% the 
"pain 
threshold" for modifying driving behavior was a gas [price of] 
two German marks per liter. 
  Only 6% believe that the government and business are 
doing 
everything necessary for the environment--60% by contrast 
are 
of the opinion that either nothing or practically nothing 
decisive is being done. Yet almost 60% say that not only 
could 
the government and business do substantially more, every 
individual could also contribute more as well. Appeals alone are 
not enough to increase willingness on the part of individuals, 
according to the Ministry for the Environment. Instead, 
environmentally acceptable behavior must be made easier and, if 
possible, be rewarded. For example, offering environmentally 
friendly products at prices which are less expensive than the 
others and not, as is often the case, more expensive.

<F P=106> [Article by Ursula Schiele-Trauth: "Fluids Replace </F>
Dangerous Organic Solvents and Break Down Harmful Substances"] 
  [Text] VDI-N, Duesseldorf, 6 May 94 - Nature 
possesses water and carbon dioxide in almost unlimited amounts. 
These natural materials are capable of assuming quite unusual 
properties. In the "supercritical" state, for example, they can 
replace solvents that are harmful to the environment and can 
break down extremely stubborn ecological poisons. Even 
chemically stable harmful substances can be broken down into 
CO[.sub]2[/] and water. 
  When liquids or gases are heated beyond their respective 
"critical temperature" and "critical pressure," they undergo a 
surprising metamorphosis. They lose their typical properties and 
take on entirely different ones. The extraordinary solvent power 
they possess in this supercritical state is extremely 
interesting for the technology field. Dr. Helmut Schmieder of 
the Institute for Hot Chemistry at the Nuclear Research Center 
(KFZ) in Karlsruhe explained: "Water becomes a universal solvent 
for organic compounds under such conditions." With respect to 
their densities, the supercritical media scientists designate as 
"fluids," are similar to liquids, although their molecules move 
as rapidly as gas particles. Fluids, therefore, surpass all 
other liquids or gases in the rate of their solvent processes. 
  The best known such process introduced throughout the world 
is the removal of caffeine by means of supercritical carbon 
dioxide. Professor Helmut Tiltscher at Munich's Technical 
University observes that "problematical solvents like methylene 
dichloride, benzene, and toluene, which had been used 
previously, can now be replaced." Carbon dioxide enjoys the 
greatest advantage as a supercritical extracting agent by virtue 
of the fact that it already achieves the solvent properties of a 
fluid at a temperature of 31C and a pressure of 74 bar. 
  In recent years, these environment-friendly and time-saving 
extractions have undergone rapid development in the United 
States, especially in the food industry, where to a great extent 
the use of halogenated hydrocarbons is forbidden. In this way, 
the fat content of foods sold as dietary aids is reduced. These 
processes are used to remove up to 80% of the cholesterol 
from 
powdered eggs and to derive aromatic substances from herbs. The 
pharmaceutical industry is currently testing a supercritical 
carbon dioxide extraction process to purify vitamin E. The 
process could replace vacuum distillation, which has been 
required to date, but which, with its temperature of 200, 
entails the danger of thermal decomposition. Carbon dioxide is 
nontoxic as a solvent, and it can be easily separated again from 
the dissolved substances after the reaction by means of 
"relaxation." 
  These supercritical processes are being increasingly used to 
separate organic toxins or oils out of sewage and contaminated 
solids. In laboratory tests researchers in the Nuclear Research 
Center have now succeeded in almost completely separating the 
grinding oil from the sludges, which build up during glass 
processing, from the rubbed-off glass powder. "In so doing," 
Schmieder concludes, "nothing more prevents the grinding oil 
from being reused." Previously, almost DM1,000 per ton had to be 
spent to dispose of the sludges in dumps. Similar experiments 
are also underway in Karlsruhe to recover the same oils from 
metal grinding sludges. About 150,000 tons of such sludges 
accumulate yearly in Germany. 
  Reactions in supercritical water offer a new alternative for 
the destruction of highly toxic waste materials. Water only 
reaches the fluid state at a temperature of at least 374C 
and a pressure of 221 bar. It not only becomes a good solvent 
for organic harmful substances, but is also mixes thoroughly 
with the air or oxygen. Under these conditions the substances 
dissolved in the water oxidize, and are therefore destroyed, in 
seconds. Several laboratories in Germany and the United States 
are now studying "supercritical oxidation" as a means of 
disposing of harmful substances. 
  The Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center has developed a pilot 
plant operation at 500C and a pressure of 250 bar with an 
hourly through-put of 10% watery media. The content of 
harmful 
substances must not exceed 10%. The system requires very 
little 
space. The 15-m-long Karlsruhe tube reactor only has an inner 
diameter of 9 mm. With the words, "unlike incineration, these 
reactions take place in a closed container," Schmieder describes 
a considerable advantage of the process, namely, in that no 
harmful substances can escape. 
  While in the subcritical state in wet oxidation the harmful 
substances are only partially decomposed, in the supercritical 
process up to 98% of stubborn waste materials like 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), explosive materials, and 
chemical agents decompose. The organic skeleton is completely 
oxidized into carbon dioxide and water. No nitrogen oxides are 
formed since the organically bound nitrogen is transformed 
mostly into molecular nitrogen. Sulfur, phosphorus, and halogens 
occur as acids or salts. 
  These anorganic salts are not soluble in the supercritical 
water. They settle on the vascular walls and still constitute 
processing difficulties. "The greatest problem is the massive 
corrosion attack which even nickel-based alloys find difficult 
to resist," Professor Siegfried Leistikow, materials expert at 
the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center, elaborated. The 
supercritical media are extremely aggressive, although hope 
exists for a solution through the use of linings made of noble 
metals. 
  But, in so doing, the system becomes more expensive. 
"However, the costs even out since the reactors are so small," 
Tiltscher reckons. Tiltscher sees the best chance for the 
process in special applications like byproducts from the 
production of medicines, chemicals from the varnish and paint 
industry, pesticides. 
  The efforts of the various laboratories and pilot operations 
in the Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology (ICT) in 
Pfinztal are concentrated on the decomposition of halogenated 
hydrocarbons, nitro-and amino aromatics like plastics. Professor 
Michael Modell of Framingham, Massachusetts, believes that 
sewage sludges are an ideal object for supercritical water 
oxidation. Having a solid material component of under 
10%, they 
are just right for this process. Modell is professor emeritus at 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, at which the bases 
for the elimination of harmful substances in supercritical water 
were developed. He claims that in laboratory conditions he can 
prevent the caking of salts and therefore prevent corrosion by 
undertaking certain constructive measures. The first commercial 
plants are scheduled for this year. 
  The attempt to clean heavily contaminated soil by means of 
supercritical water is being tackled by Professor Gustav Brunner 
in Hamburg-Harburg. The soil is placed in the system as a fixed 
bed and then irrigated by the fluid. "The supercritical water 
has to handle a dual role in the process," Brunner explains. 
First, it has to rid the soil of as many hydrocarbons as 
possible, and, second, it has to oxidize the contaminants only 
to the point that they become biologically degradable. However, 
Brunner admits that the costs involved in this process of soil 
cleansing are so great that it can only be used in exceptional 
cases.

<F P=106> ["Berlin Scientists Develop Electrochemical Soil </F>
Rehabilitation Process"] 
  [Text] VDI-N, Duesseldorf, 6 
May 94 - To date, fine-grain soils, port-, clear-, or 
galvanic muds could only be inadequately cleansed of heavy 
metals and harmful organic substances at great cost. The 
Institute for Technology and Environmental Protection of the EGA 
(Development Company Adlersdorf mbH) in Berlin is currently 
testing an alternative method, which was recently displayed at 
the Hannover Fair. In the new method, the heavy metals and 
harmful organic substances are removed from the soils and muds 
electrokinetically. 
  In the process, an electrical field, which induces a fine 
water flow in the soil capillaries, is generated by means of two 
electrodes. Since the harmful substances dissolved in the ground 
water are encased in a water envelope (hydrate shell), they 
are--owing to the viscosity of the water filaments--moved along 
with the flow until they reach, depending on their electrical 
charge, either the cathode of the anode. Heavy metals like lead, 
cadmium, and mercury, but also the harmful organic substances as 
well, together with their water envelopes gather at the poles, 
where they are then pumped off. The EGA researchers see 
particular advantages in the new process in that it can be used 
to cleanse the ground soils beneath developed areas as well. 
  Researchers at the Laboratory for Chemical Engineering in 
Geneva (EIG) are developing a similar technique. There, the 
mercury-containing sewage is caused to flow through an 
electrochemical cell, where the positively charged mercury ions 
gather at the cathode. The mercury is subsequently removed from 
the cathode by heating in an evaporator with an internal 
condenser, where the metal is recovered. The cathode can be used 
repeatedly. Using this method, even small businesses can process 
mercury-containing sewage economically and at little cost to the 
point where the mercury residual concentration is five ppb.

<F P=106> [Article by Christa Friedl: "Zeolite Cools and Heats </F>
Economically and in an Environment-Friendly Manner"] 
  [Text] VDI-N,Duesseldorf, 6 May 94 - Whenever cooling 
is generated, waste heat occurs. A new process, developed by the 
Zeo-Tech Company in Bavaria, utilizes the waste heat to generate 
hot water simultaneously with the cold in the refrigerator. All 
of this is accomplished without the use of 
environment-threatening CFC's (chlorofluorocarbons), FHC's 
(fluorinated hydrocarbons, or hydrocarbons. 
  The Joern Schwarz stand at the Hannover Fair simply 
displayed 
cold beer and hot water. At first glance, that in itself 
constituted nothing particularly unusual at this year's Fair. 
What is extremely unusual, however, is the way the main 
developer at the Zeo-Tech Company in Unterscheissheim, Bavaria, 
cools the beer and heats the water. Both are effected with water 
vapor and 12 kg of sand. 
  Schwarz relies on a simple technical principle, namely, that 
highly porous materials--in this case, a sand-like zeolite that 
occurs naturally and which for a long time has also been used as 
a substitute for phosphates in detergents--at a negative 
pressure voraciously sucks up the water evaporating from a water 
surface. In the process, the minerals develop heat, while the 
water, owing to the evaporation, is cooled and eventually 
frozen. Some zeolites can--without replacement--sop up water as 
often as needed and then release it again. In this process, a 
cold circulation is generated. 
  "Private households use 25% of the primary energy 
expended 
in Germany annually to produce heat and cold," Schwarz points 
out. Usually, this is done in separate processes as a result of 
which a considerable amount of power is lost. What could be more 
desirable than to have the cold and the heat generation linked 
together? 
  The successful result of this endeavor is the "cool-boiler," 
a combined apparatus consisting of an electrical hot water 
generator and a refrigerator. The bottom line here is that only 
the boiler consumes power. "The operation of the refrigerator 
comes gratis," Schwarz is pleased to say. 
  It was not a simple matter to convert the theoretical 
physical principles into a practical system however. It cost the 
researchers at the Zeo-Tech Company about three years in R&amp;D 
time before they could build the first successful prototype. 
This method of discontinuous energy conversion procedes in two 
phases. The first phase lasts only as long as it takes for the 
zeolite to become saturated with water. Then, in the second 
phase, a reverse procedure is effected through the introduction 
of heat. The water is forced out of the zeolite in the form of 
water vapor, is then liquified in a condensor, and then, in the 
next step, can via a collecting main be sucked up again in the 
evaporator. 
  For the operation of the cool-boiler, the two evacuated 
zeolite containers (weight filled of each is six kg) are 
alternately heated, thereby forcing the adsorbed water out 
(desorber). For the prototype, the required electrical power was 
about 1 KW. The water vapor releases its heat in the condensor, 
after which it is transferred to the boiler water through the 
casing wall. The water flows through a line into the 
refrigerator's evaporator. There, the other zeolite container 
can suck up the water vapor that is generated. In this way, the 
heat required for the evaporation process is drawn out of the 
inside of the refrigerator. During the process, the zeolite is 
heated to 150C, sending this heat to the boiler water via a 
heat-exchanger. The process continues until one adsorber is 
saturated with water and the other has its water removed. "Using 
twelve kilos of zeolite, the process lasts two to three days," 
Schwarz notes. Then the adsorber and desorber exchange roles. 
This technique can generate up to -20C in the refrigerator, 
and 90C in the boiler. The system is regulated by an ESP 
control system. When the temperature gets too high, a 
temperature sensor in the refrigerator sends a pulse signal to 
the vacuum pump which again activates the adsorption process. 
  One of the hard nuts to crack in the development of this 
technique was the evaporator. Decisive in its functioning is a 
fiber in which the water can rise and which offers a large 
surface area. No less important is the requirement that the 
fiber not be destroyed or damaged by the formation of ice 
crystals. The Zeo-Tech developers had a stroke of luck and 
chance in this matter. A fiber glass material is used in the 
prototype that easily withstands the countless evaporation and 
cooling processes. 
  Schwarz and his team of researchers is now working on the 
further development of the control and regulating technology and 
on optimizing the zeolite system. The refrigeration technicians 
expect better energy utilization through the use of aluminum 
heat exchangers that are dip-coated in zeolite powder with 
ceramic glue. Schwarz still cannot provide precise data on the 
system's power balance. It is to be ascertained in the coming 
months. 
  In any case, this year's Fair brought the refrigeration 
technicians an unexpected success. A "white goods" [linen] 
manufacturer in Saxony expressed interest in a cooperative 
venture. The first cool-boiler system could appear on the market 
as early as 1996.

<F P=106> ["Discussion on Future Energy Concepts"] </F>
  [Text] VDI-N, Cologne, 6 May 94, MG - During 
several lively discussion periods, agreement was found on many 
points when representatives from industry and the government 
held a panel discussion on the topic "Future Energy Concepts" at 
a joint session of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and the VDE 
(Association of German Electrical Engineers) in Cologne on 28 
April 1994. 
  Doctor Engineer Horst Lennertz, board member at Preussen 
Elektra, is convinced that the demand for power, and especially 
current, will continue to increase. To be sure, the consumption 
of current required for each individual application will be 
less, but the number of overall uses for electrical current will 
grow constantly. The electrical current requirements would have 
to be met by a mix of different primary power sources. For that 
reason, German electrical companies will continue to rely on 
coal- and nuclear-powered plants, but current will also be 
generated from wind and solar power. Lennertz is further 
convinced that "at best, such regenerative sources could reach 
from 10% to 20% of the total share." 
  Dr. Hermann Scheer, a member of the Bundestag, takes strong 
issue: "There is absolutely no doubt that renewable power 
sources must eventually replace the sources that have been used 
to date." The president of Eurosolar has labeled the persistence 
of the electrical companies "structural conservatism." 
CO[.sub]2[/]-emissions will only be significantly reduced 
when regenerative power sources occupy a substantially greater 
share of the total supply picture. A comprehensive support 
program for photovoltaics would help effect a swifter 
breakthrough. 
  "Structural changes take decades," Professor Ernst Ulrich 
von 
Weizsaecker believes and proposes his own long-term program. 
Were power costs increased annually by means of an energy tax by 
only 5%, but over a period of 50 years, neither the 
individual 
consumer nor any specific branch of industry would suffer. In 
this regard, the president of the Wuppertal Institute looks 
forward to an "efficiency revolution," by means of which the 
standard of living reached per energy unit could be increased by 
a factor of 4. 
  Adolf Huettl, member of the board at Siemens, remarked: "In 
all of these ideas about energy in the future, the simple fact 
that the worldwide demand for power will double by the year 
2000. Without new fossil fuel-based and nuclear-power-based 
plants, this demand cannot be covered. It is true that 
regenerative power sources will gain in importance in the 
developing countries. German industry, as an exporter, is ready 
for this. Although German industry possesses the technological 
competence, it can only be maintained if the technologies are 
employed at home as well.

<F P=106> [Article by Christa Friedel: "Halon Disposal on </F>
Verge of Being Launched"; Subheadline: "Extinguishing Agents 
Harmful to Ozone and Climate Eliminated in Plasma Jet"] 
  [Text]Duesseldorf, 13 May 1994 -- Halons harmful to the 
ozone and the climate have been banned in Germany since the 
start of the year. What is to be done, however, with the nearly 
8,000 tons [t] from fire extinguishers and extinguisher systems? 
Solutions are now looming for the elimination of the especially 
stabile chemical substances. 
  The use of halons as a fire extinguishing agent in the event 
of a fire was a sure recourse for a long time for chemical 
firms, computer centers, the federal railway and even for many 
automobile operators. Halons extinguish quickly and reliably, 
they do not produce toxic gases and do not damage systems and 
equipment. Their special contents deserve the credit for all of 
that: chemical compounds that release chlorine, bromine and 
fluorine at high temperatures, putting a stop to the combustion 
process. 
  Those times are gone: since the start of the year, the 
ordinance prohibiting fluorochloro-hydrocarbons [FCKW] has 
banned the production, circulation and use of fully halogenated 
halons as an extinguishing agent. For such substances, similar 
to FCKW, are so chemically resistant that they rise undecomposed 
to an altitude of 20 kilometers [km] and destroy the protective 
ozone layer there, doing so considerably more rapidly than FCKW. 
Halon 1211 has been assigned an ozone destroying potential [ODP] 
that is triple that of R 11, the comparable FCKW substance; 
halon 1301's ODP, in fact, is higher by an order of magnitude. 
Additionally, both of them contribute to a large degree to the 
greenhouse effect. 
  For practical purposes three different halons basically 
matter: bromochloro-difluoromethane (halon 1211), 
bromotrifluoromethane (halon 1301), that had been used mostly in 
the former laender, and chlorobromomethane (halon 1011) from the 
new laender. 
  Making it particularly difficult to eliminate halon is its 
strong chemical resistance. Although in principle elimination in 
special waste incinerators is feasible, such a facility still 
can handle only limited amounts of input. "After all, halons are 
fire extinguishing agents," as Dr. Holger Brackemann, halon 
expert in Berlin's federal department of the environment, tosses 
out for consideration. More promising in this respect is a 
process of Plasmactor Umwelttechnik limited company [GmbH] from 
Britz in Brandenburg. In cooperation with Martin-Luther 
University in Halle, Merseburg college and a research institute 
in Minsk, White Russia, the firm has developed a plasma process 
that was just introduced for the first time at the Hannover fair. 
  In it the halon molecules are broken apart in a plasma jet. 
The plasma jet is generated in a plasma arc torch with air 
serving as plasma gas. At 10,000 degrees Celsius [C] the 
airborne oxygen splits up into avid radicals. Those radicals 
react in a reaction chamber that is approximately one meter in 
length with the halons and split off chlorine and bromine. Left 
over as resultants are hydrochlorine (HCl), hydrobromine (HBr), 
hydrofluorine (HF) and carbon dioxide. 
  In the second step, a sodium hydroxide solution is 
introduced 
through a nozzle at the end of the reactor chamber. HCl, HF and 
HBr acids react with the sodium hydroxide to yield sodium salts. 
This is followed by a cooling down to under 200C. 
Solid-state salt that can be recycled in the industry is 
recovered from the salt solution via intermediate condensers and 
a number of filtering steps. 
  "Plasmactor's" special feature is use of a rotating plasma 
jet generated by two plasma torches in a staggered formation 
relative to one another. They ensure intense turbulences that 
powerfully intermingle air and halons so that reaction time is 
minimized and the conversion rate is increased. Plasmactor 
managing director Reinhardt Schulz succinctly states: "99.9 
percent of the halons are converted." 
  Selection of materials that have to be especially resistant 
to heat is critical for the operation of the plasma reactor. The 
reactor consists of a double casing of high-grade steel through 
which the coolant flows. It envelops a 10-millimeter [mm] thick 
interior tube of aluminum oxide that is blended with a limited 
amount of other oxides. According to Schulz: "The interior tube 
is capable of withstanding reaction temperatures of nearly 2,000 
degrees C without any problem." On the one hand a cooling 
jacket, and on the other hand the high flow rate of the gas in 
the tube counteract any overheating. According to Schulz, 
disposal costs are about seven German marks [DM] per kilogram 
[kg]. 
  The "Chemical Reverser" of the Concentric Maschines [CM] 
firm 
in Treuchtlingen in Bavaria operates according to the same 
principle. In this case too, halons are broken apart in a plasma 
torch, this time under pressure at approximately 
2,000-3,000C. CM uses natural gas as plasma gas. The gas 
releases reactive hydrogen radicals that split apart chlorine, 
fluorine and bromine from the halon molecules. The resulting 
hydrogen halides are neutralized with a solution of caustic soda 
or caustic potash and cooled to 60C in the process. 
Zettner's secret material is an inner lining of "a non-oxide 
ceramic" for the reactor that is to aggressive halides. Like 
Plasmactor managing director Schulz, CM developer Michael 
Zettner too hopes that the resulting potassium or sodium salts 
will find industrial customers. 
  In cooperation with Deutsche Aerospace AG [DASA], two CM 
facilities, each with 1,000 tons yearly capacity, are supposed 
to start operating on DASA sites in Treuchtlingen and in 
Schrobenhausen in Bavaria. According to Zettner: "The 
authorization process for one of the facilities is under way." 
In this connection he is pinning his hope on the effect of the 
new law facilitating investment that is supposed to scale the 
period for authorization down to a few months. Zettner's 
prognosis is: "We could get going with the disposal in the 
second half of the year." 
  But elimination of the substance solves only one side of the 
halon problem. Just as important is a dense network of 
collection and return centers for extinguishers. And that could 
be problematical: most of the 1.6 million portable fire 
extinguishers in private residences, business and vehicles in 
West Germany, in which close to 6,000 t of halon 1211 are lying 
dormant, are unregistered and as a result are beyond any 
monitoring. And whether the nearly 3,000 fixed extinguisher 
systems containing nearly 2,000 t of halon 1301 will be properly 
disposed of depends not least on the environmental awareness of 
the respective owners. 
  It will be even harder to bid adieu to the ozone destroyers 
in the new laender. Partially halogenated halon 1011 that is 
widespread in them is not encompassed by the Montreal Protocol 
and its production and use continues to be permitted.

<F P=106> [Article by Christa Friedl: "Increased Recycling </F>
Rewards Recyclers with Boom"; Subheadlines: "Entsorga 94: Every 
Third Exhibitor Offers Waste Recycling Products and Services"; 
"Community Facilities to Produce High-Quality Products from Used 
Materials Still Missing"] 
  [Text]Duesseldorf, 13 May 1994 -- Exhibitors at this year's 
Entsorga fair are encountering an optimum basis for business in 
Germany: the piles of waste are higher than ever before. 
According to estimates by the Federal Association for German 
Waste Disposal [BDE], last year they consisted of nearly 55 
million tons [t] of household waste. 
  For this reason, recycling has never yet been so important 
as 
it is today. First, according to a forecast by the Berlin 
federal environmental department, by the year 2000, every other 
German household waste landfill will have used up its capacity. 
Second, against the backdrop of the fair, BDE's principal 
managing director, Frank-Rainer Billigmann, remarked: "Secondary 
raw materials afford the sector great opportunities." Numerous 
companies have already acknowledged this: almost every third one 
of the nearly 1,550 exhibitors at Entsorga, from 18 to 21 May in 
Cologne, is offering technologies, products and services 
centered on secondary raw materials. 
  Still, it is easier to champion recycling than to practice 
it. On the one hand, the recycling bill passed by the federal 
parliament in April, expands the amounts of used material piling 
up each year for recycling. On the other hand, private waste 
disposers and communities for the most part still do have 
facilities to produce products from used materials using modern 
technology. The market itself is another hurdle for recycling. 
As noted in a report on the sector that has just been submitted 
by the market research firm of AIK [expansion not given] 
Kohlhaas &amp; Partner in Krefeld: "Only if the price of used 
materials covers the cost of collection systems can one expect a 
working waste recycling system." The Krefeld firm considers 
continued development of environmental engineering in the 
direction of improved processes for recycling of used material 
as the greatest prospect for the used materials business. Better 
analysis and more effective sorting techniques will result in 
purer sorting and, as a result, more valuable secondary 
materials. 
  The sector's response to the recycling boom is the creation 
of financially powerful waste disposal companies. But this 
development is not meeting with general approval. Michael 
Mueller, environmental spokesman for the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany [SPD] remarks: "The processes leading to 
concentration in the waste disposal business undercut 
competition." A major parliamentary question to the federal 
administration in March by the SPD aims at examining the threat 
of monopolization. BDE spokesman Hanskarl Willms is also 
convinced: "Concentration will continue in the sector. Many 
waste disposal tasks can be tackled only by financially powerful 
companies because of their sophisticated facilities and 
technologies." 
  There is hardly any doubt that the large number of waste 
disposal tasks will grow even more in the future. The reason is 
that waste avoidance has so far been hardly successful. 
According to AIK managing director Edgar Kohlhaas: "The 
political machinery is missing." According to his prediction, 
even in the future there will be no decline in the amounts of 
waste material, at best they will hold steady. The new recycling 
law already acknowledges this: in it recycling is not valued any 
higher than incineration.

<F P=106> [Article by Tony O'Brien, environment correspondent: "New </F>
Bid To Curb Chemical Pollution"] 
  [Text] Tough new controls on the country's chemical 
industry are to be introduced by Environmental Protection 
Minister John Browne. 
  Other areas of industry will also be targeted. 
  This will be done through the new Wexford-based 
Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) which will issue a series of detailed 
licences covering a range of industrial operations from the 
middle of next month. 
  Although the licensing system will not initially cover the 
pharmaceutical industry, it is known that Mr Browne is anxious 
to bring this into place as quickly as possible, particularly 
because of accidents at Cork plants last summer. 
  Cork Co Council had been asked to review the licence for the 
Hickson plant at Ringaskiddy, where a major fire took place last 
year, but has failed to do so. The EPA will now have the job. 
  The new regulations, which come into force on May 16, mean 
the EPA will be responsible for licensing various operations 
which have pollution potential. 
  These include chemicals, food and drink, minerals and other 
materials, energy, wood, paper, textiles and leather, cement and 
waste. 
  Other activities will be phased into the licensing system 
and 
Mr Browne has said that large-scale manufacture of pesticides, 
pharmaceutical or veterinary products and the incineration of 
waste will come into the EPA's scope from September 1. 
  Mr Browne said: "I am determined that large-scale, complex 
and specialised activities should come within the EPA's control 
as rapidly as possible and I will be keeping a watch on the 
level of new activity in the various categories and how the 
system works."

<F P=106> [Elisabeth Crona report: "Oresund Bridge Causes War of </F>
Words"] 
  [Excerpt] A new war of words has broken out between the 
Swedish and Danish prime ministers -- this time over the Oresund 
bridge. 
  "Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is making dealing with the issue more 
difficult. It will not be decided by diktat from Denmark," Carl 
Bildt said when he received reports of his Danish counterpart's 
remarks at the annual national conference of the Federation of 
Swedish Farmers in Karlstad yesterday. 
  After a Danish cabinet meeting yesterday morning Nyrup 
Rasmussen had spoken of "the delay which has already affected 
the project" and urged the Swedish Government to reach a swift 
decision: 
  "I would ideally like to avoid an expression like `weeks,' 
he 
said, wanting to talk more in terms of days if not hours now 
that SMHI [Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute] 
and its Danish counterpart, DHI [Danish Hydraulic Institute], 
had in their calculations confirmed a zero solution for water 
throughflow. 
  "To be frank I am surprised that Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is 
holding press conferences about what is Sweden's business, 
before the Swedish Government has even been able to read the 
relevant material," Bildt said adding, in a travesty of 
"something rotten in the state of Denmark," that there is 
"something strange going on in Denmark." (A comment on a 
statement from Nyrup Rasmussen about changes in the planned 
construction of the bridge.) 
  Yesterday afternoon neither the Swedish Environment Ministry 
nor the Prime Minister's Office had received the documentation 
which the Oresund Bridge Consortium had posted in Malmo on 
Monday. 
  Carl Bildt and [Environment Minister] Olof Johansson are 
agreed in one respect about handling the issue in the future. 
It will be treated as an administrative matter -- hence the 
irritation with the Danes' stressing Sweden's political will to 
arrive at a swift decision. 
  The Swedish Environment Ministry's strategy is to be 
pedantic 
and correct. 
  "We do not want a complaint to the Supreme Administrative 
Court," said one of Olof Johansson's experts, who is "almost 
certain" that the professional fishermen in the area will appeal 
if the examination of the environmental effects of the bridge is 
not carried out to the letter. 
  Olof Johansson himself said that he will not allow himself 
to 
be rushed and that the bridge issue is such that it ought to be 
decided in an election. 
  There is, however, a sensitive point in the Swedish 
Government's future handling of the bridge question. According 
to information received by SVENSKA DAGBLADET, the Environment 
Ministry is going to want to send the new calculations of 
south-flowing water currents in the Baltic Sea back to the Water 
Rights Court. Reference is made here to the press statement of 
13 January which states that the court's ruling will be of 
decisive importance when the government comes to reach a 
decision on the issue. 
  Carl Bildt on the other hand has said that he finds it 
"difficult to see" why the issue must be brought before the 
Water Rights Court again. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Steen Vogt report: "Swedes Put on Their Thinking Caps"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday morning the Swedish Environment Ministry 
finally received the latest calculations of the blocking effect 
the Oresund link will have on the water flowing through the 
Oresund into the Baltic Sea. 
  And now, according to press secretary Reidar Karlsson, the 
ministry will spend the "next few days" going through the 
documents from the Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI) and the 
Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. The 
calculations show that the blocking effect of the link is 
between 0.32 and 0.52 percent, with a 0.2 percent margin of 
error. As a result the desired zero solution can be achieved 
through the compensatory dredging of 2.3 million cubic meters 
from the bottom of the Oresund. 
  It has not yet been decided whether the ministry will then 
be 
able to make any direct recommendations to the Swedish 
Government in a few days' time or whether it needs to call in 
one or more experts from outside to evaluate the calculations. 
  "The ministry's experts will now go through these documents, 
but it is too early to say whether they have the necessary 
competence to carry out a final evaluation of them. But this 
will be decided within the next few days," Reidar Karlsson said. 
  According to RITZAUS BUREAU, the report from the Denmark's 
DHI contains mild "criticism" of the Swedish Water Rights Court 
which last Friday gave the thumbs-down to the calculations 
produced so far by the Oresund Bridge Consortium. 
  "Our first report to the Water Rights Court which was based 
on varying current conditions showed that the bridge did not 
have a blocking effect of more than 0.5 percent," DHI department 
chief Jacob Steen Moller said. 
  According to Steen Moller, it was unnecessary, after the 
first report, for the Water Rights Court to demand new 
calculations regarding south-flowing currents in the Baltic Sea.

  [Text] The number of nuclear plant workers dying 
prematurely from all illnesses, including cancer, is lower than 
the national average, according to a report funded by the atomic 
energy industry which is published today. 
  The survey includes information on more than 75,000 people 
employed between 1946 and 1982 by the UK Atomic Energy 
Authority, the Atomic Weapons Establishment, and British Nuclear 
Fuels at Sellafield. 
  Workers fell into two groups -- those likely to be exposed 
to 
radiation who were monitored, and those who were not. The second 
group included office workers and caterers. 
  Researchers found deaths from all causes in monitored 
workers 
were 19 per cent lower than average, while overall deaths from 
cancer were 18 per cent lower. By 1989 there were 40,761 workers 
in the monitored group, of whom 1,884 had died of cancer. 
  Dr Valerie Beral, of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, 
said: 
"The fact that the number of deaths was lower than average was 
not unexpected. This is common in high-skill industries which 
tend to employ healthy people." 
  The cancers most commonly linked with radiation exposure in 
previous studies were those of the prostate, uterus, lung, and 
multiple myeloma and leukemia. The new analysis showed that only 
leukemia was clearly linked with external radiation. 
  Dr Lucy Carpenter, of Oxford University, said: "The 49 
leukemia deaths observed in monitored workers were similar to 
the number predicted by general rates but the risk of the 
disease rose with the radiation dose in these workers. 
  "The dose-related risk was confined to those last employed 
at 
Sellafield, where radiation doses were higher." 
  Deaths from thyroid cancer were also higher than average -- 
for every 100 cases expected, 181 were observed. Dr Beral said: 
"The increase was found in groups but there was some weak 
evidence that the increased risk in monitored workers was linked 
to radiation dose. This is being investigated further."

<F P=106> [By reporter Ji Jincheng (1323 6651 2052)] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai, 6 Jun (XINHUA) -- While experiencing a 
great margin of economic growth last year, Shanghai city 
witnessed a remarkable drop in discharges of industrial waste 
water and waste gases. However, the city's solid waste 
discharge increased in 1993. These are facts revealed in the 
"1993 Communique on Shanghai City's Environmental Situation" 
recently released by the Shanghai Municipal Environmental 
Protection Bureau. 
  The communique says that Shanghai scored a GNP of 51 billion 
yuan in 1993, an increase of 14.9 percent over the 1992. Its 
industrial growth was 16.8 percent in 1993. Meanwhile, 
Shanghai's annual industrial waste water discharge was 1.28 
billion tons in 1993, a drop of 6.5 percent from the 1992 
record. The volume of industrial waste water treated in 1993 
reached 1.09 billion tons, representing an increase of 5.5 
percent over 1992. The discharges of major pollutants in 
industrial waste water witnessed a drop in 1993 from the 1992 
record. Last year, the city consumed 32.736 million tons of 
coal, a slight increase over 1992. In 1993, Shanghai's total 
discharge of waste gases amounted to 423.05 billion cubic 
meters, including 385.92 billion cubic meters of industrial 
waste gases, representing a drop of 17.2 percent and 12.6 
percent respectively from the 1992 record. The discharges of 
major pollutants in waste gases decreased to various extents, as 
compared with 1992. Industrial solid wastes increased by 4.9 
percent over 1992, reaching 11.98 million tons. 
  In terms of Shanghai's environmental quality in 1993, the 
communique has the following overall evaluation: The quality of 
water and air is better than 1993 but there is little progress 
in reducing noise.

  [Text] Beijing, 4 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--An official 
of the Security Bureau of China National Nuclear Corporation 
recently said that in the past 40 years since the founding of 
China's nuclear industry, no environmental pollution incident 
had ever occurred; although China's nuclear industry developed 
later than in other countries, its operation had always been in 
a good condition. 
  According to the results of the "Assessment of Radiation 
Environmental Quality Over the Past 30 Years in China's Nuclear 
Industry," the average radiation level of the environment within 
80 kilometers around the nuclear facilities was just 0.01 
percent higher than the level of natural radiation [tian ran ben 
di zhao she 1131 3544 2609 1646 3564 1410], and the effect on 
the environment was extremely slight. 
  In the last 10 years, China's nuclear industry has made 
substantial progress in the management of radiation waste and 
the handling of the old nuclear facilities that were no longer 
in operation. At the same time, marked results were achieve in 
the establishment of perfect standards and regulations for 
environmental protection and in the aspect of international 
cooperation. 
  The official said: Alongside the achievements, some problems 
also exist. For example, environmental monitoring was somewhat 
weakened, the quality of monitoring has declined somewhat, 
personnel and equipment are aging, the quality of the 
environment has to be further improved, and the professional 
quality of environmental protection personnel has to be further 
enhanced. 
  Reportedly, environmental protection work in China's nuclear 
industry is now focused on the handling of waste, and the 
management of nuclear waste is being strengthened. Laws and 
regulations will be enforced strictly, monitoring will be 
strengthened, modern means will be used to improve the process 
of environmental assessments so that the quality of the work in 
this regard will be enhanced, procedures will be simplified, the 
environmental protection industry will develop on a considerable 
scale, and personnel training will also be strengthened.

  [Text] Beijing, June 6 (XINHUA) -- The emphasis which China 
has placed on saving water-use in the cities had had good 
effects, said Ye Rutang, vice-minister of construction. 
  Since 1983, Chinese cities have saved using 13.9 billion 
cubic meters of water altogether. The ratio of recycled water 
used has increased from less than 20 percent in 1983 to 60 
percent. 
  China economizes to save using 1.39 billion cubic meters of 
water annually, equal to building seven water-works with a 
capacity of 500,000 cubic meters. 
  Economizing on water obviously helps to protect China's 
water 
resources and city environments, he pointed out. 
  Waste water which had to be disposed of has decreased by 1.1 
billion cubic meters every year through the save-water drive. 
  Shanghai, Tianjin, Ningbo and other cities have improved 
their control of earth subsidence by stronger management of 
utilization of ground-water resources. 
  China also saves 6.95 billion kwh of electricity every year 
by cutting water-use, Ye said. 
  China has 2,800 billion cubic meters of water resources, the 
sixth greatest in the world. But each Chinese citizen only has 
2,440 cubic meters, a quarter of the world average, due to 
China's large population of more than 1.1 billion. 
  Figures from the provinces so far available in Beijing show 
that by the end of 1993, there was water shortage in about 300 
cities out of China's total of 570 cities. 
  To make people conscious of the importance of keeping 
water-use down, China has set aside the second week in June 
every year as a period for special publicity on saving water, ye 
said. 
  He added that the government has set up a special 
organization in the Ministry of Construction and branches in 
most of the cities to coordinate water-saving efforts.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--It is 
learned from authoritative departments that by the end of 1994, 
191 enterprises in Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong, will be 
closed down or merged with other enterprises, or their 
production will be stopped or changed, to reduce pollution of 
the Huai He and to keep the water of the river clean. 
  Mass media here have disclosed that the water of the Huai He 
valley is seriously polluted and nearly 50 percent of river 
sections have become useless; in some areas, polluted water has 
been used to irrigate land over a long period resulting in a 
decrease in grain output and the content of pollutants in 
agricultural produce exceeding safety standards; the output and 
variety of fish and shrimp have decreased; and disputes over 
pollution between different localities have become more and more 
conspicuous. In dry seasons, plants often have to suspend 
production. The shortage of water resources has become more and 
more serious and control over the Huai He brooks no delay. 
  A meeting on enforcing laws to protect the environment of 
the 
Huai He valley was held in Bengbu, Anhui, from 24-26 May. 
Besides laws and regulations on prevention and treatment of 
pollution to be revised this year, provisions concerning crimes 
in causing pollution will be added. The formulation of 
"Regulations on Prevention and Treatment of Pollution in the 
Huai He Valley" is also being discussed.

  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Despite China's rapid 
economic development, the country's environmental problems are 
coming under control, with only a few regions facing serious 
environmental pollution, the State Bureau of Environmental 
Protection said here today. 
  "Although China is facing increasing pressures from 
environmental problems as the country has taken energy, raw 
materials and other basic industries as the top priorities for 
development, the country has still achieved progress in the 
control of industrial pollution," the bureau said in its annual 
report on the country's environmental and ecological situation. 
  According to the report, in 1993 the amount of smoke and 
dust 
released into the air in urban areas remained the same as in 
1992. 
  "The water quality in rivers, reservoirs, underground and 
offshore remains fine," the report says. 
  "The country's forests are expanding, and the areas of 
nature 
reserves now account for 6.8 percent of the country's total 
territory," the report says. 
  "But the volume of mature forest trees which can be logged 
is 
shrinking," it notes. 
  "The degradation, desertification and saltification of 
grassland are continuing, while the loss of water and soil 
remains serious," the report adds. 
  "Over-exploitation of underground water in urban areas is 
rampant and the deterioration of the eco-environment of the 
country's fishing industry is yet to be controlled," it warns. 
  The report blamed coal burning for the air pollution in many 
of China's cities. "Such air pollution is more serious in 
winter and in big cities than in summer and small towns. 
  "In 1993, more Chinese cities suffered from acid rain than 
in 
the previous year," according to the report. 
  Meanwhile, Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Bureau of 
Environmental Protection, promised, "China will devote more 
efforts to environmental protection while speeding up economic 
development."

<F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "Government Urges Better Protection of </F>
Forests"] 
  [Text] Excess logging in recent years prompted the central 
government to urge all departments and local governments to ban 
misuse of the nation's forests. 
  "The annual quota for allowable tree-felling must be 
strictly 
observed and all activities involving logging, transporting and 
processing of wood must be conducted under licences," the 
government announced. 
  China's boom in construction and development has led to a 
worrisome imbalance between logging and new growth in the 
nation's forests, the statement warned. The supply of mature 
timber is almost exhausted, it was noted. 
  Legal and administrative units of the government may not 
engage in such activities, the government said. 
  Some inspections will be launched later this year to help 
implement the Forest Law and relevant regulations, according to 
the circular issued by the State Council, the country's highest 
governing body. 
  All violations of the Forest Law and regulations, such as 
clear-cutting forests, illegally occupying woodlands and 
indiscriminate hunting of wildlife, will be severely punished, 
it said. 
  Violations rose 16 percent last year, compared with 1992, 
said an official from the Ministry of Forestry. 
  Large profits from trading in timber -- in short supply on 
the market -- attracted more people and even government 
departments to engage in the business, noted the official, who 
declined to be identified. 
  Some culprits, often armed with weapons, had attacked forest 
keepers and looted timber from tree farms. 
  Last year, 31 forest keepers and officials working at timber 
checkpoints were killed, and another 1,200 were wounded, 
according to the official. 
  Booming construction and industrial development zones also 
consumed large amounts of woodland. 
  Some local governments, ignoring the Forest Law and relevant 
regulations, occupied forest-land for other use without approval 
from authorities or sold woodland at very low prices in order to 
attract outside investment for industrial development. 
  As a result, some 450,000 hectares of woodland was lost 
annually for various kinds of development programme or 
construction, said the official. 
  In a bid to curb such unchecked tree-felling and to keep a 
balance between timber growth and consumption, the central 
government has since 1987 required licenses and implemented 
quotas for logging. 
  Despite such measures, the quota was exceeded every year, 
the 
official noted. 
  Although China has increased its forest coverage to current 
13.9 percent from 12.9 percent of national territory five years 
ago, its mature timber is nearly exhausted, with only about 1.96 
billion cubic metres left.

<F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "Steps Taken to Clean Up Pollution"] </F>
  [Text] The quality of China's environment is fairly good, 
considering the pressures put on it from the country's rapid 
economic development. 
  But in a few places, pollution and other kinds of 
environmental deterioration have worsened, according to a 
national report on last year's environmental status released by 
the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) yesterday. 
  On a positive note, less waste water was discharged last 
year. Total waste water discharges amounted to 35.5 billion 
tons, or 3 percent less than the year before. Industrial 
discharges accounted for 21.9 billion tons of the total, a 6.2 
percent drop over last year. 
  The volume of solid industrial wastes stabilized at 20 
million tons last year. 
  Meanwhile, more trees were planted, leading to a new total 
of 
133 million hectares of forested land. 
  But some environmental problems became worse last year. 
  Emissions of certain air pollutants grew. Soot emissions 
rose by 7.1 percent, and sulphur dioxide, which causes acid 
rain, went up by 6.5 percent. 
  All waste gases last year totalled 11 trillion cubic metres. 
  The worse places for air pollution due to coal burning were 
found in the bigger cities of north China during the winter and 
spring. 
  The extent of acid rain did not expand much but it was found 
more frequently in the southern cities, including Jiangxi 
Province's Ganzhou, Changsha of Hunan, Chongqing of Sichuan, and 
Hangzhou of Zhejiang. 
  Atmospheric pollution has become one of the major causes of 
respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchial pneumonia and 
lung cancer. The mortality rate of lung cancer in cities was 34 
per 100,000 people, a rise of 18.5 percent over 1988. 
  Among farmers, respiratory ailments have become the 
number-one killer, with a death rate of 165 per 100,000. 
  The report also said that the urban stretches of big rivers 
and some lakes were seriously polluted. 
  Noise pollution has also worsened, mainly due to crowded 
urban conditions, traffic, and industry. 
  Last year, over 2,700 industrial pollution cases were 
reported throughout the country, an increase of 94 cases over 
the previous year, causing an economic loss of over 220 million 
yuan ($25 million). 
  More than 10 million hectares of farm land were polluted, 
reducing grain harvests by 12 billion kilograms. 
  There were 107 large-scale geological disasters such as land 
collapses, land-slides, and mud flows, claiming 432 lives. 
  The report noted progress in some areas, however. The 
disposal rates of waste gases, water, and solids have been 
raised. And more people have the benefit of central heating and 
piped gas. 
  By the end of last year, 766 natural reserves had been set 
up, taking up 6.8 percent of the country's total area. 
  Preservation centres for endangered animals were established 
in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Guangdong Provinces and Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region. Over 300 wild animals have been put under 
State protection. 
  Xie Zhenhua, NEPA administrator, said that the country's 
challenges for the future are to improve its energy efficiency, 
control greenhouse-gas emissions and industrial and urban 
pollution, and develop new technology to protect the environment.

<F P=106> [CHINA DAILY Commentary: "Environmental Defence"] </F>
  [Text] Tomorrow (June 5) is World Environment Day. It is 
a day aimed at increasing people's awareness about the 
importance of environmental protection around the globe. 
  China, with its vast territory and large population, has a 
duty to keep the air fresh and water clean in this part of the 
world. 
  Back in 1973, China convened its first national conference 
on 
environmental defence. In the early 1980s, environmental 
protection was made a basic concern of the State. Since then 
China has paid close attention to environmental protection while 
developing its economy. 
  Over the last 12 years the economy has grown rapidly yet its 
environment has not deteriorated. This has brought great 
benefits to the people. 
  Realizing the importance of a concerted effort in the battle 
to protect the environment, China has forged close relations 
with relevant world bodies. 
  In response to the call of the Earth Summit, held in Rio de 
Janeiro in 1992, China published a white paper earlier this year 
entitled: "Population, Environment and Development in the 21st 
Century." Dubbed "Agenda 21," the proposal lists 63 projects, 
including the cleaning of smokestacks, saving farm land from 
soil erosion, protecting endangered species, and the development 
of sustainable oil reserves. 
  In February, China endorsed three international resolutions 
banning the disposal of radioactive and industrial wastes at sea. 
  Laws and regulations have been adopted, creating a legal 
framework for environmental protection. 
  The Chinese Government has vowed to further strengthen 
legislation and increase investment in this regard to help bring 
about sustained economic development. 
  Spending on environmental protection is to be raised from 
the 
current 0.7 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), or 20 
billion yuan ($2.3 billion), to 1 percent of GDP by the year 
2000. 
  Like other developing countries, China still has a long way 
to go before radically improving its environment. 
  Despite efforts made, factories in China are discharging 
6.85 
million tons of sulphur dioxide annually, the second highest 
amount in the world. Six billion tons of solid waste are piled 
up across the country and soil erosion caused by the misuse of 
land affects almost 20,000 square kilometres a year. 
  Because many people continue to be indifferent to 
environmental defence, laws and regulations are often not 
implemented and in some cases simply ignored by some local 
authorities. This is one of the main problems faced by those 
carrying out China's environmental protection work. 
  A tightening-up of the issue is needed. Enterprises which 
actively treat their pollutants should be commended while those 
who refuse to do anything about it should have their operations 
shut down and their management fined. 
  In its bid to protect the environment, China has received 
foreign help. In the past decade, the World Bank, the Asia 
Development Bank, and global environmental foundations have 
provided over $1 billion in grants or low-interest loans to 
finance China's environmental protection projects. 
  Such help is much appreciated. 
  As envisaged by "Agenda 21," industrial pollution in China 
will be completely controlled by the year 2000. Such an 
achievement will be an important contribution to the world. And 
China will not relax until it has succeeded in its task.

<F P=106> [Report by Yu Changhong (0060 7022 3163) ] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun (XINHUA) -- What were China's 
environmental conditions like last year? The "Communique on 
China's Environmental Conditions" issued by the State 
Environmental Protection Bureau today says: Under the 
circumstances of a fairly rapid economic development in 1993, 
environmental conditions were relatively more stable. 
Environmental pollution and damage to the eco-environment were 
still continuing. A small number of areas were seriously 
polluted, whereas pollution in some areas was brought under 
control. The eco-environment was turning for the better. 
  According to the regulations of the "Environmental 
Protection 
Law of the People's Republic of China," the State Environmental 
Protection Bureau will issue a "communique on China's 
environmental conditions" for the previous year on the eve of 5 
June -- World Environment Day -- every year after 1990. Since 
the United Nations convened the Congress on Environment and 
Development, the Chinese Government has paid much more attention 
to coordinated development of the environment and the economy, 
adopted the strategies for sustained development, and put 
forward a series of countermeasures and measures on environment 
and development. Environmental conditions around the country 
are stable as a whole. 
  The communique issued today notes: Air pollution caused by 
smoke from burning coal is still very serious in cities -- it is 
more serious in winter and spring than in summer and fall, in 
north China than in south China, and in medium and big cities 
than in small towns. The discharge of sulfur dioxide and 
industrial dust has increased to some extent, and acid rain has 
been found in more cities than in the previous year. 
  In 1993, water pollution found in rivers around the country 
was a kind of organic pollution. Water quality in mainstreams 
was better than in tributaries, and rivers passing through 
cities were more seriously polluted. Over exploitation of 
underground water was rampant in cities, and the deterioration 
of the eco-environment of the fishing industry had not been 
brought under effective control yet. The degradation, 
desertification, and salinization of grasslands continued, and 
the volume of mature forest trees which could be logged was 
shrinking. 
  Concerning the work of environmental protection in 1993, 
local people's governments at all levels and various departments 
under the State Council have intensified their work and 
extensively launched inspections of the enforcement of the 
environmental protection law under the guidance of the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council and have made 
achievements in preventing and controlling industrial pollution. 
The amount of smoke and dust released into the air in cities 
remained the same as in 1992. The water quality in mainstreams 
of big rivers, inland rivers, large-sized reservoirs, 
underground water in cities, and most offshore waters remained 
fine. Municipal and public facilities were further improved; 
progress was made in declaring and registering discharged 
pollutants; control over dumping at sea was further strengthened. 
  In 1993, people around the country have further enhanced 
their environmental concepts, and environmental campaigns with

  [Text] Kunming, June 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists have 
succeeded in artificially cultivating 108 species of endangered 
plants in southwest China's Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical 
Garden. 
  Located in Yunnan Province, Xishuangbanna is the only vast 
area of tropical forest in China. It covers an area of 19,000 
sq km. It also boasts one sixth of the species of seed plants 
and pteridophytes in China. In 1959 the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences set up the tropical botanical garden, the first of its 
kind in the country. 
  Because of human activities leading to deterioration of the 
environment, the tropical forests at Xishuangbanna have shrunk 
by 50 percent in the past five decades. Many species of plants 
are on the verge of extinction. 
  In 1984 the tropical botanical garden set aside 80 ha of 
land 
to cultivate the endangered species. After years of research 
and experimentation the garden has succeeded in cultivating 108 
species of endangered plants, including 46 species that were 
listed among the 53 major species of plants under state 
protection. 
  Many of these plants date back to the tertiary period and 
are 
considered as living fossils. 
  In order to better study and protect the endangered plants, 
the tropical botanical garden is preparing to set up a bank of 
seed genes of tropical plants.

  [Text] Lanzhou, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Two wild horses are due 
to be born at a breeding farm in the north-west desert -- good 
news for the species at the brink of extinction worldwide. 
  There are only 900 of this breed of horses left all over the 
world, according to a report from the International Wild Horse 
Association. 
  The two pregnant mares are being taken care of in Gansu 
Province by the endangered wild life breeding center, which lies 
in the heart of the Tenggeli Desert. 
  Years ago the wild horse almost became extinct in China -- 
its original birth place. The rescue work started in 1988 when 
the center imported ten horses from the United States and 
Germany. Now altogether 16 horses live in this desert, which 
has nearly half of its area green-covered. 
  Other wildlife, such as saiga antelope, Asiatic wild ass, 
takin, wild camel, gold-haired monkey and white-lipped deer, 
have also found their paradise here. 
  In the monkey village, the youngest is only one month old 
while the oldest is the 13-year-old king. 
  The breeding center will be extended to 6,600 hectares this 
autumn.

  [Text] Taipei, May 31 (CNA) -- Sun Ming-hsien, chairman of 
the Council of Agriculture (COA), will visit the United States 
in late July to talk with American officials on trade sanctions 
against Taiwan for illegal rhino horn and tiger bone trade, 
council officials said Tuesday [31 May]. 
  The COA head will meet with officials of the US Department 
of 
the Interior and some wildlife conservation groups, the 
officials said [words indistinct]. 
  While Taiwan is set to face US import prohibitions on 
wildlife specimens and products, they noted, it is hoped that 
the United States will shorten the sanction period. 
  The office of US Trade Representative released a list of 
proposed import bans on Taiwan wildlife products in late April 
following an order by President Bill Clinton earlier that month. 
  The import bans, which are mandated under the Pelly 
amendment 
to the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967, are expected to be 
put into practice in mid-June. 
  Taiwan products targeted for US import prohibition include 
shoes and handbags made from reptile skins, jewelry made from 
coral, mussel shells and bones, edible frogs' legs, live 
goldfish and tropical fish for the aquarium trade, and bird 
feathers. 
  The COA officials held optimistic views about a shorter 
sanction period, saying the prospect will be better if the 
legislature passes a series of amendments to the wildlife 
conservation act by the end of June. 
  Sun is currently accompanying Premier Lien Chan on a visit 
to 
El Salvador and Guatemala.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769)] </F>
  [Excerpt] Beijing, 5 Jun (XINHUA) -- The first meeting on 
Chinese women and the environment was held today at the Great 
Hall of the People in Beijing in conjunction with a meeting to 
mark the "June 5th" World Environment Day." Addressing the 
meeting, State Councillor Song Jian called for increasing 
society's awareness of the environment, stepping up propaganda 
and education, and fostering environmental ethics. He urged 
every woman to enthusiastically take part in the great cause of 
developing the economy and protecting the environment and to 
create a better tomorrow with concerted efforts. 
  The meeting was jointly sponsored by the State Environmental 
Protection Bureau and the All-China Women's Federation with a 
view to enhancing, among the broad ranks of women, the 
understanding of environmental problems, increasing their 
environmental awareness and enlisting their participation in the 
environmental cause and in advancing China's environmental 
undertakings. Song Jian said: Women play an irreplaceable role 
in the modernization drive. Mothers exercise the most direct 
influence on the youngsters and children -- the future of 
society. We must build such a consensus in society; that is, 
polluting the environment is a behavior that runs counter to 
social ethics and the standards of the law and infringes upon 
the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people and 
future generations. Participation of tens upon millions of 
women in the cause of economic development and environmental 
protection will have a major impact on the family, society, and, 
in particular, the youngsters and children. 
  Cheng Siyuan, National People's Congress Standing Committee 
vice chairman, and Qian Zhengying, National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference vice 
chairman, were present at the meeting and spoke. [passage 
omitted on units and individuals honored at the meeting]

<F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "Polluters Warned of Criminal Penalties"] </F>
  [Text] In the latest move to stem pollution at its source, 
the central government is urging local authorities to take stern 
legal and economic action against violations of State 
environmental laws and regulations. 
  Individuals and companies that pollute the environment will 
face economic penalties, and serious cases must be prosecuted, 
said Song Jian, State Councillor and Director of the State 
Council's Environmental Protection Committee yesterday in 
Beijing. 
  In a speech marking World Environment Day, Song pointed out 
that the discharge of pollutants into the environment violates 
both public ethical standards and State laws. It harms the 
basic interests of all people and their offspring. He said it 
was a crime similar to smuggling narcotics or marketing fake 
medicine. 
  Song stressed that environmental protection must be based on 
legislative administration accompanied by scientific and 
technological advancement and economic development. 
  He also urged greater publicity to raise environmental 
awareness. 
  One step in this direction will be taken on Wednesday, when 
nine government ministries will jointly launch a TV programme of 
lectures on China's environmental legislation at China Central 
Television Station, Song said. 
  Commemorative activities were held throughout the country on 
the global day, whose theme was "one earth, one family." 
  The Zhongwei Sand-Fixation Forest Farm in Northwest China's 
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region received national focus, since it 
was honoured as one of the "global 500" projects by the United 
Nations' Environment Programme (Unep). 
  Since 1987, 16 individuals and units in China have won the 
title, which commemorates contributions to environmental 
conservation. 
  For the past three decades, the farm has successfully 
protected the railways from Baotou in the Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region to Lanzhou in Gansu Province. In addition, it 
has turned 280,000 hectares of desert and sandy land into oasis 
and farmland. 
  The forest farm's techniques have been copied in other 
provinces and autonomous regions, as well as foreign countries. 
  Also yesterday, the National Environmental Protection Agency 
(NEPA) and the All-China Women's Federation jointly sponsored a 
national meeting on Women and the Environment in Beijing. 
  One hundred women were praised for their contributions and 
achievements in the country's environmental protection work. 
  Participants drew up a National Environment Declaration for 
Chinese Women, which called upon women throughout the country to 
devote themselves to global action against pollution and to 
preserve the ecological balance. 
  The declaration says that Chinese women--comprising one-10th 
of the world population--should take responsibility for the 
sustainable development of the global environment. 
  The day also featured the opening of a three-day 
China-United 
States seminar on environment surveillance administration and 
technology.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 6 (XINHUA) -- The environmental 
quality at Shanghai's Xinhua Street area, notorious for 
industrial pollution, has been greatly improved thanks to a 
ten-year effort. 
  The 2.2-square-kilometer area in the western part of the 
city 
houses 110 plants involved in industrial chemicals, medicine, 
paper-making, metallurgy, machinery and electrical appliances, 
and meters and instruments, which discharge heavy pollutants, 
waste water and gas. 
  Since 1985, the municipal government has spent 450 million 
yuan in the treatment of pollution in this area, which has 
completed 407 pollution-treatment projects and removed, closed 
down or merged 25 plants and workshops discharging heavy 
pollutants. The municipality has also planted more trees, lawns 
and flowers. 
  As a result, the industrial output value of the area last 
year went up by 33 percent over 1985 and the amount of 
discharged waste gas was reduced by at least 70 percent and 
waste water by 50.7 percent. 
  Noise in the area does not exceed the municipal 
government-set standard at present.

  [Text] Xiamen, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Xiamen will never 
sacrifice the environment for economic benefits, Hong Rongshi, 
mayor of the special economic zone in east China's Fujian 
Province, said today. 
  A city whose population has doubled and whose economy has 
grown more than twelve-fold, Xiamen has maintained its 
environmental level as it was a decade ago, and has built a 
series of pollution control projects. 
  Known as a seaside resort, Xiamen has allocated its island, 
mainland and suburbs different industries for attracting 
overseas investment, so as to attain simultaneous development of 
economy and environment. 
  The city is now a major attraction for overseas investment 
and for Chinese and foreign tourists. Its air pollution is 
under control and its water quality is among the country's best.

  [Text] Hangzhou, June 6 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang 
is the country's top province as far as environmental protection 
goes. 
  It tops the list when it comes to environmental quality, and 
its forest coverage rate is 46 percent, also one of the highest 
rates in China, according to an appraisal of environmental 
quality made by the ecologic research institute of the Chinese 
academy of sciences. 
  In recent years, with the development of township 
enterprises, environment pollution has increased accordingly, 
and the provincial government has formulated regulations to deal 
with the problem, according to a recent forum to mark world 
environment day sponsored by the provincial environment 
protection bureau. 
  For example, while promoting silkworm breeding and fruit 
production, the provincial government decreed regulations 
concerning fluorine pollution. In addition, to ensure the 
purity of the water used in making the famous local Shaoxing 
rice wine the provincial legislature enacted a set of 
regulations to protect Jianhu Lake. 
  The local government has also emphasized controlling the 
pollution caused by township enterprises engaged in printing, 
dyeing, tanning, chemical engineering and papermaking. 
  The province has set up various kinds of nature reserves and 
scenic resort areas to protect rare animals and plants, natural 
scenery, water, and cultural relics.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Construction of the 
Shanghai ships' sewage treatment plant, financed largely by a 
grant from a United Nations fund for global environmental 
protection and loans from the World Bank, has just started. 
  Local officials said Friday [27 May] that the project will 
cost 120 million yuan (about 13.79 million U.S. dollars), of 
which 4.31 million U.S. dollars will be covered by donated money 
from the U.N. fund and another 6.23 million U.S. dollars will be 
covered by World Bank loans. 
  The plant will be built and managed by the Shanghai Maritime 
Transport (Group) Co. The plant at Waigaoqiao, Shanghai, will 
have a 300m waterfront, with a dock to handle ships with 35,000 
dead weight tonnages. It will be equipped with modern greasy 
dirt and sewage treatment facilities. 
  The whole project is expected to be finished in 1995. By 
then, the plant will help treat 400,000 tons of greasy dirt and 
sewage and 100,000 tons of water polluted by chemicals a year. 
  Construction of similar environmental protection projects 
has 
also started in five other port cities: Dalian, Tianjin, 
Ningbo, Xiamen and Guangzhou. 
  The building of the projects in these six ports will involve 
use of a total of 30 million U.S. dollars of donated money from 
the U.N. fund and 15 million U.S. dollars of loans from the 
World Bank.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
disease reports monitored from FBIS Abidjan Bureau and EAU 
coverage areas. Source information is given in parentheses after 
each item. 
<H5>  Ghana </H5>
  Malaria -- A health official has announced at a workshop 
that 
the high incidence of malaria in the Effidua-Sekyere District is 
due to self-medication by patients and bad treatment practices 
by health personnel. According to the official, one-third of 
all diseases reported in the district last year were malaria 
cases, out of which 812 people were admitted to hospital and 21 
died. [Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in 
English 0600 GMT 2 May 94] 
  Buruli ulcer disease -- The incidence of the buruli ulcer 
disease in the Ashanti Region is now reported to have 
drastically reduced following systematic weekly and monthly 
intervention in the endemic areas by medical teams from the 
district and the regional directorate of health services during 
the past nine months. According to the Ashanti regional 
director of health services, Dr. J. K. Amofa, a total of 300 
buruli ulcer cases were recorded in eight districts in the 
region last year. This year, the number has reduced to only 56 
cases from three districts. The Amansie West District, which 
recorded the highest number of 200 cases last year, now has only 
24 recorded cases. 
  Dr. Amofa said in an interview at Tentokrom that whereas 
last 
year, a monthly average of between 40 and 50 new cases of the 
disease were reported at health institutions, this year this has 
dropped to a monthly average of between eight and 10 new cases. 
He said the medical intervention have been able to successfully 
stabilize the situation in the Kwabre, Effidua-Sekyere, and 
Atwima Districts, where no new cases have been reported. The 
only problem area now is Ashanti Akim North, where about 30 
cases have been recorded. Dr. Amofa said the early diagnosis of 
the disease and the removal of the preulcerative nodules in the 
victims through excision have contributed to the drastic 
reduction in the incidence of the disease. Between August last 
year and March this year, medical doctors removed preulcerative 
nodules from 48 victims at the Tentokrom buruli ulcer dressing 
station alone. A total of 87 ulcers were also dressed at the 
station and are in various stages of healing. [Accra Ghana 
Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in English 1300 GMT 3 May

<H5>  Niger </H5>
  Guinea worm -- Guinea worm disease is generally on the 
decline in Niger. The number of recorded cases fell from 33,000 
in 1991 to 25,000 in 1994. [Libreville Africa No. 1 in French

outbreaks of and reports on various diseases. Items are listed 
by country and disease. The source follows each item. 
<H5>  Angola </H5>
  Cholera -- "A serious cholera outbreak, the biggest over the 
past four years, is progressively spreading in the Angolan 
coastal provinces. The Voice of Resistance of the Black 
Cockerel learned this from the KWACHA UNITA PRESS [KUP]. 
According to KUP, Luanda Province is topping the list with more 
than 25 cases of cholera per day. It is followed by Cuanza Sul 
Province which is also experiencing an outbreak of bilharzia. 
Health sources fear many people could die of the disease 
because hospitals have no conditions to effectively fight the 
disease. Cholera kills more than 30,000 people in Angola every 
year. The main victims are children." (Jamba Voz da Resistencia 
do Galo Negro in Portuguese 1200 GMT 1 May 94) 
<H5>  Mozambique </H5>
  AIDS -- "A total of 60 AIDS cases were reported in Tete 
Province between January and March of 1994, raising to 336 the 
number of cases recorded since 1986. The Tete Province Health 
Services Directorate has said that AIDS is spreading throughout 
the province at a frightening pace." (Maputo Radio Mozambique 
Network in Portuguese 1730 GMT 26 Apr 94) 
  Measles -- "Manica Province registered 265 cases of measles 
last year, against 108 diagnosed in 1992. This was revealed 
during the 22d provincial health coordinating council meeting. 
The meeting also revealed that more than 420,000 consultations 
were carried out throughout the province last year, following 
the normalization of security conditions." (Maputo Radio

<H5>  Angola </H5>
  Cholera in Benguela Province -- "Cholera is said to be 
spreading in (Sousa Chipande), Benguela Province. Our 
correspondent in the province reports that more than 1,000 
cholera cases were recorded in April alone. That figure does 
not account for people who have not approached hospitals for 
treatment." (Jamba Voz de Resistencia do Galo Negro in 
Portuguese 0600 GMT 6 May 94) 
  Cholera in Luanda -- The coordinator for diarrhea-related 
diseases in Luanda Province reports that of the 400 cholera 
cases recorded in Luanda in the first third of this year, four 
were fatal. She said that 260 cases were recorded in April alone 
and two of those people died. A total of 40 cases and one death 
had been reported in January. She admitted that, because there 
are clandestine cemeteries on the outskirts of the capital, 
cholera- related deaths may have occurred and not been reported 
to the authorities. She also said that 4,189 cholera cases had 
been recorded last year, resulting in the deaths of 109 people.

  Dysentery -- "A total of 10 people died of dysentery in Moma 
District, the south coast of Nampula Province, between March and 
April. Moma District Health Director Xavier Canjalo told Radio 
Mozambique that the outbreak is already under control and at 
present there are no other cases. He said this was caused by 
drinking dirty water." (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in

<H5>  Swaziland </H5>
  AIDS -- According to a recent study by the Ministry of 
Education "Swaziland is to have more than 100,000 AIDS orphans 
in 12 years time." "The study projected that the number of 
orphans will reach 11,500 by the year 2006. The rising number 
of AIDS orphans would require assistance in their education `as 
natural parents and economically active members of the extended 
family fall victim to AIDS.'" (Mbabane THE SWAZI OBSERVER in

<F P=106> [REport by Annie Thomas] </F>
  [Excerpts] Nairobi, April 28 (AFP) -- Fighting raged in 
Rwanda on Thursday [28 April] as a cholera epidemic threatened 
the central African nation swamped in ethnic bloodletting and 
relief officials launched impassioned pleas for aid. More than 
40 orphans, half of them seriously wounded and some with arms or 
legs hacked off, were flown to Italy on Thursday after being 
rescued from an orphanage by aid workers. [passage omitted] 
  The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) meanwhile warned 
that cholera was likely to sweep Kigali, strewn with rotting 
bodies, some half eaten by dogs. Much of the capital is without 
water and the situation in the rest of the country is equally 
catastrophic, UNICEF's Peter McDermott said. "I'm sure there 
are already cases of cholera," McDermott told AFP on his return 
from Kigali on Thursday. He said fighting had prevented medical 
teams from assessing needs. 
  Two tonnes of chlorine flown in by UNICEF were stuck in a 
warehouse at the airport which was hit by a shell Wednesday, 
though 40 tonnes of food and emergency supplies have been partly 
distributed to needy civilians, McDermott said. 
  Relief agencies meanwhile launched impassioned pleas for 
international aid for Rwanda, where the UN has slashed its 
peacekeeping force from 2,500 to 270 because it feared for their 
safety. [passage omitted] 
  "Half the population urgently need help," said Philippe 
Gaillard, the Red Cross chief in Kigali. Rwanda's population is 
estimated at seven million. Gaillard said that before the 
fighting, a million Rwandans displaced by the three-year civil 
war already depended on food aid. Another million have fled 
their homes since April 6, he said. "The international 
community must not forget Rwanda, even if it has to be concerned 
with Gorazde and South Africa too," Gaillard said. "It's the 
heart of darkness in Rwanda," Red Cross spokesman Tony Burgener 
said. 
  Unable to work safely in Kigali, aid agencies are organising 
relief operations from border towns in neighbouring Uganda, 
Zaire, Burundi and Tanzania. 
  They bring in food and medicine, and evacuate casualties. 
  Red Cross workers went to the north-eastern town of Gisenyi 
on Thursday to see 350 orphans who may also need to be evacuated 
to Zaire. 
  In Kigali, for the first time in two weeks the Red Cross was 
able to get 13 wounded people to hospital without being harassed 
at the numerous roadblocks manned by militiamen, soldiers or 
rebel guerrillas. 
  The Red Cross had stopped evacuating casualties after 
militiamen murdered six wounded people being driven to hospital 
in a Red Cross vehicle two weeks ago.

<F P=106> [Report by Vusie Ginindza] </F>
  [Excerpts] Minister for Health, Dr. Derek von Wissel on 
Thursday night gave the Senate a horrifying picture of the AIDS 
situation and its impact on the immediate future of the country. 
  He said government will never cope with the scourge in as 
far 
as concerns treatment of AIDS patients and provision of hospital 
facilities. [sentence as received] 
  To cope, he said, government will have to build a hospital 
in 
every six months and be able to provide between 400 to 500 beds 
every year. 
  "That is taking into consideration that each patient will be 
in hospital for 20 days," he said. 
  He said the present nurses-to-patient ratio stands at 1 to 
600 and there is only E[emalangeni]1 million this year to be 
used in the prevention of AIDS, after having been increased from 
E300,000 last year. 
  He told senators that in the next two years, people will be 
dying in large numbers as long as they don't change their 
behaviour. 
  As a result, he said, there would be 40,000 orphans and 
helpless old people who would be left stranded as bread-winners, 
as people in the sexually active range, would have died. 
  Dr. von Wissel was replying to several questions from 
Senators during the debate on the vote of the Ministry of Health. 
  Senators wanted to know the cause of the disease, its impact 
and if there were any plans to counter its effects. 
  The minister said sexual promiscuity is the largest 
contributing factor to the epidemic. He said children are 
becoming sexually active "much too much early" as between 15 to 
18 years. 
  To emphasise this view, the minister informed the House that 
one out of 10 women who are treated for maternity problems in 
hospitals, is a child who attempted or committed a back-street 
abortion. 
  He said 75 percent of 16 year olds are sexually active, half 
of whom have got more than one partner at a time and have sex, 
at least, more than two times a month. [passage omitted] 
  Presently, he said, 22 percent of the population are HIV 
positive (have the virus that eventually develops into AIDS). 
  "One in every five in the country has the HIV virus. In 
certain areas, out of three women, one has it." 
  The minister said AIDS should not be stigmatized. "It's just 
like cancer or any other disease that we have since learnt to 
live with. So people should stop thinking of it as a dirty 
disease."

  [Text] In 1993, a second survey was conducted in Ruili City 
and two other counties, where a cohort study field was 
established in 1992. Seven hundred and fifty-five drug users and 
102 spouses of HIV infected IDU's were interviewed. Nine samples 
among 54 from 89 IDU's in cohort were tested as seroconversion. 
The seroconversion rate (incidence rate) in IDU's (per hundred 
person years) in Ruili, Longchuan, and Luxi as well were 40.0, 
12.2 and 0, respectively in 1993, comparing to 43.2, 12.2 and 0 
in 1992. Thirty-eight were tested as positive among 108 samples 
from 116 newly recruited IDU's. The seroprevalence rates in 
these three counties were 85.7 percent, 40.0 percent and 0 in 
1993, comparing to 81.8 percent, 44.6 percent and 5.1 percent in 
1992. A coordination of the level between seroconversion and 
seroprevalence was observed. An increasing trend of 
seroprevalence among the spouses of HIV positive IDU's was 
found, the seroprevalence rate were 3.1 percent in 1990, 9.8 
percent in 1992 and 7.4 percent in 1993. More attention should 
be paid to Luxi where the ratio of intravenous drug user 
increased rapidly, although fewer positives and later starting 
of drug using was found in this county.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhu Baoxia: "State Combats IDDs"] </F>
  [Text] The State yesterday kicked off a nationwide 
campaign to combat iodine deficiency diseases (IDDs). 
  Citizens around the country got free advice about how to 
identify fake from real iodized salt, which prevents the disease 
when taken. 
  In Beijing, officials set up consulting centres downtown and 
in rural districts where IDD is a threat. 
  And at the Beijing Children's Hospital, people crowded in to 
get free information. 
  The China Salt Industrial Corporation provided samples of 
fake and substandard iodized salt, while State Councillor Peng 
Peiyun, State officials and UN representatives at the event 
urged people to take iodized salt and called for a crackdown on 
fake products. 
  Several companies donated 1 million yuan ($115,000) and 
iodized foods to children in rural areas. 
  IDDs can cause mental retardation and birth defects. They 
can also lead to miscarriages and are a cause of infant death. 
  Scientists say the intelligence quotient of children 
affected 
by IDDs is often 10 to 15 percentage points lower than their 
peers. 
  Yet the diseases can easily be prevented by consuming a 
small 
amount of iodine, a common additive in salt. 
  IDDs are common in 1,762 counties, 62.2 per cent of the 
country's total, according to a Ministry of Public Health report. 
  An estimated 400 million Chinese live in high-incidence 
districts. The figure accounts for 40 percent of the world's 
population threatened by IDDs. 
  In Beijing, IDDs affect 5 million people in 175 towns in 11 
districts and counties. 
  Still, China has made enormous progress since the early 
1950s. The number of patients has decreased from 35 million in 
the 1950s to 8 million, thanks to a better supply of salt and 
iodine pills. 
  But IDDs have made a comeback in recent years. Last year a 
survey of 12,000 children aged seven to 14 in Miyun County 
showed that goitre cases rose to 6 percent from 1.15 percent in 
1988. 
  Medical experts attribute the jump to an increase in 
uniodized salt on the market. 
  An investigation of 2,309 batches of iodized salt in Beijing 
in 1992 showed that only 52 percent met State standards. A 
third of people threatened by IDDs failed to consume enough 
iodized salt. Many unknowingly had bought cheap--and 
fake--imitations. 
  In the past four months, Beijing officials uncovered 29 salt 
smuggling cases and confiscated 500 tons of the product. 
  China hopes to eradicate IDDs by the year 2000. 
  Yesterday's activities received support from five State 
ministries and administrations. 
  Local public health departments in other parts of the 
country 
also sponsored educational activities.

  [Text] The investigation of Lyme disease in Beijing area is 
reported for the first time. The sera of 1,314 local residents 
were examined by indirect immunofluorescent assay, 11.9 percent 
of them were seropositive to Borrelia burgdorferi. 
The principal vector was Haemaphysalis longicornis. 
Six strains of B. burgdorferi were isolated from 
ticks or patients using modified BSK medium. Spirochetes were 
found in five treat the patients, and the effective rates were 
64 percent and 88 percent, respectively.

  [Text] Before 1986, tsutsugamushi disease was only 
prevalent in the south to Zhejiang Province in China, which was 
found to be the summer type, and Leptotrombidium (L.) 
deliense was regarded as the main vector. In October 1986, 
the authors found this disease in Nanjing and carried out a 
series of studies in 1986-1992. The results were as follows: 
Tsutsugamushi disease was epidemic in Nanjing and north of 
Jiangsu (including: Dongtai, Haian, Rudong, Jinhu, Hanjiang, 
Jiangdu); which was found to be autumn-winter type, with main 
reservoir hosts being Apodemus agrarius, Rattus 
confucianus, R. norvegicus and Crocidura 
lasiura; and transmitting vector L. (L.) 
scutellare. The pathogen of tsutsugamushi disease of the 
autumn-winter type -- Rickettsia tsutsugamushi 
belonged to low-virulent strain, and could not easily be 
detected. After the inoculated mice were treated with diluted 
cyclophosphamide solution, 14 strains of R. 
tsutsugamushi were isolated from rats, mites and patients, 
and serological typing of their sera showed that they belonged 
to the Gilliam type. Natural foci in Jiangsu could be divided 
into two types -- flat land and hilly land.

  [Text] From May to June 1992, Apodemus agrarius 
and Apodemus speciosus were captured in Hunchun, 
Jilin Province. Four strains of Rickettsia 
tsutsugamushi were isolated from viscera of rats and 
trombiculid mites. At the same time, the antibody against 
Rickettsia tsutsugamushi was assayed in the sera of 
the local people and the wild rats. The positive rates were 15.2 
percent and 16.4 percent, respectively. The above results showed 
that a natural epidemic focus of scrub typhus exists in Hunchun 
area.

  [Text] Nanjing, may 6 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese National 
Center for Control of Venereal Diseases and Leprosy was 
inaugurated here today. 
  Located at the Institute of Dermatology and Venereology 
under 
the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the center will be 
responsible for technically guiding the study and appraising the 
research results of sexual diseases and leprosy, providing 
scientific data for the Ministry of Public Health to draw up 
policies for controlling the diseases, undertaking education and 
technical training of personnel in the field, monitoring the 
situation of epidemic diseases throughout the country, 
collecting international information about sexual diseases and 
leprosy, and conducting international academic exchanges in this 
field. 
  After several years of effort, sexual diseases had been 
basically wiped out in New China by the late 1950s and early 
1960s. Meanwhile, the incidence of leprosy had been greatly 
reduced. Statistics show that so far a total of 360,000 victims 
of leprosy have been cured. At present, there are about 10,000 
leprous patients in the country. 
  However, the incidence of sexual disease in the country has 
risen again since the 1980s. In order to more effectively bring 
the diseases under control and to reach the goal of wiping out 
leprosy in China by the year 2000, the Ministry of Public Health 
decided to set up the national center.

  [Text] Jinan, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Shandong Province has 
become China's first province to be basically free from leprosy. 
  According to the Ministry of Public Health, the province 
also 
took the lead in the country in wiping out kala-azar, filariasis 
and malaria. 
  According to historical data, this coastal province in east 
China has had a history of leprosy of 2,500 years. 
  A survey in 1960 found that the incidence of leprosy reached 
0.1 percent in 16 counties and 0.01 percent to 0.1 percent in 74 
counties. 
  To wipe out the infectious disease, the Shandong provincial 
government has set up 79 special leprosy control and treatment 
organizations since 1955. These organizations have employed 
1,691 people. 
  While launching massive publicity on the elimination of 
leprosy, these organizations have carefully ferreted out leprosy 
cases and effectively studied and treated the diseases over the 
past four decades. 
  By the end of last year the province had cured 39,654 
leprosy 
cases. 
  Shandong now has 255 patients under treatment. 
  Its incidence of leprosy over the past five years has 
dropped 
below 0.5 per 100,000 people, reaching the standard set by the 
Ministry of Public Health.

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Zhu Baoxia: "Small Town Model for </F>
Immunizing Children"] 
  [Text] The small town of Zhaohegou in Hebei has turned 
into a national model for vaccinating children against epidemic 
diseases through its immunization insurance effort, now in its 
10th year. 
  For several years, the town outside Sanhe City has not 
reported a single epidemic disease in its 2,800 children under 
seven. 
  It has one township hospital and 20 village clinics to 
support a population of 19,000. 
  In 1984 the town adopted a contracted responsibility system 
for preventive health care, a policy to supervise and urge 
village doctors to rededicate their efforts. 
  Each child is registered immediately after birth to ensure 
that no one misses the vaccinations. 
  Every household is charged seven yuan ($0.8) a year for 
immunization insurance. If an insured child gets an epidemic 
disease, the village clinic will be fined and is responsible for 
paying all medical fees. 
  The system has won over the town farmers. 
  "Seven yuan a month [as published] is not too much and most 
important we don't have to worry about our child's health," said 
Zhao Yuhua, 30, the mother of a 2-year-old girl in Zhaotuzhuang 
Village. 
  The town has attracted attention from the central government 
and some international organizations. 
  Representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO) and 
the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) called for the rest 
of China and other developing nations to follow Zhaohegou's lead 
by immunizing their children. 
  "Wiping out children's epidemic diseases like polio in China 
would be a great contribution toward the Asian and Western 
Pacific Region and the whole world as well," said Dr R.W.K.Gee 
of WHO. 
  State Councilor Peng Peiyun and Public Health Minister Chen 
Minzhang also want to spread the small town's success to other 
rural areas, where about 900 million Chinese live. Immunizing 
these areas is the critical portion of the national immunization 
programme. 
  If all the rural areas succeed like Zhaohegou, Peng said, 
China could wipe out polio next year. 
  Peng and Chen visited the town on Monday. 
  The ministry said its expanded immunization programme has 
dramatically reduced incidence and death rates of children's 
epidemic diseases by 89.93 and 88.78 percent. 
  Last year just 653 polio cases were reported, the lowest 
figure in Chinese history. 
  Measles cases dropped from more than 1 million in 1981 to 
last year's 117,800, and the incidence of whooping cough and 
diphtheria also dropped by 98.2 and 98.5 percent respectively. 
  But experts warned that each year there are 20 million 
newborns, requiring an astronomical number of vaccinations. 
Methods must be worked out to guarantee that all those children 
are immunized on time. 
  The ministry wants rural areas given top priority, and 
extensive publicity campaigns should be launched to educate 
farmers about disease prevention.

<F P=106> [Report by Zhu Baoxia: "Blood Banks To Get on Spot Test for </F>
Hepatitis C"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Public Health is to introduce an 
instant test for the hepatitis C Virus in medical centres across 
the country this month. 
  The test, which can show up results in half an hour, will be 
applied to blood products in a bid to curb the spread of the 
chronic and sometimes fatal liver ailments caused by the virus. 
  About three per cent of China's 1.2 billion population carry 
the new virus strain. 
  Many hepatitis C victims contracted the virus through blood 
transfusions. 
  The instant test which will be used in the nation's 
hospitals 
and blood banks, was developed by the microbiological research 
department of the People Liberation Army's No. 2 Medical 
University. 
  Hepatitis C, which is mainly transmitted through blood, can 
lead to cirrhosis and cancer of liver. 
  About 90 percent of Chinese hepatitis cases caused by 
medical 
treatment are C type. 
  The PLA researchers studied the country's hepatitis C 
epidemics and established a virus gene bank.

  [Text] The gap between heterosexual and homosexual 
transmissions of the AIDS virus is closing far more quickly than 
predicted and looks set to disappear within the next three 
months, according to a government specialist. 
  In the past quarter there have been 16 heterosexual HIV 
transmissions reported compared with only one homosexual 
transmission, narrowing the gap to just eight cases, according 
to Health Department statistics. 
  There have now been 157 HIV infections in the territory that 
were heterosexual transmissions compared with 165 homosexual 
infections. 
  In January, the Health Department's AIDS consultant, Dr. Lee 
Shui-shan, predicted that the heterosexual/homosexual 
transmission gap would disappear by the end of the year. 
  But in a review of the HIV infection pattern during the 
first 
quarter of this year, Dr. Lee said yesterday heterosexual 
transmission was likely to overtake homosexual transmission by 
the middle of the year. 
  "What we are seeing is a dramatic rise in heterosexual 
transmission of HIV although the important message is that this 
gap is closing," Dr. Lee said. 
  Last month four men and two women were found to be infected 
with the AIDS virus, bringing the total number of reported cases 
of HIV in Hong Kong to 435. 
  One new case of full-blown AIDS was also reported to bring 
the total to 100, 65 of whom have died. 
  "Although we are still seeing a steady increase in the 
number 
of HIV infections we are seeing an explosive increase in the 
number of AIDS cases as more people infected with the virus are 
developing AIDS-related illnesses," Dr. Lee said. 
  In the past quarter there have been eight new AIDS cases 
compared with only one in the previous quarter. 
  Dr. Lee said the number of deaths from AIDS did not include 
"several" people with HIV who had committed suicide. 
  The Health Department's AIDS unit is now setting up a 
community charter to tackle the problem of discrimination 
against HIV carriers in the workplace. 
  "Most of those infected are of working age and so there is a 
need to actively educate people not to discriminate at work," 
Dr. Lee said.

  [Text] Bandar Lampung, Sunday. -- Two prostitutes, 
occupants of a brothel in Bandar Lampung, and a youth, who is 
currently detained at Lampung's Welfare Rehabilitation Center 
for a criminal offense, were found to be positively affected by 
the HIV virus. 
  Umar Hassan, chief of the team for prevention of AIDS in 
Lampung, stated to newsmen in Bandar Lampung on 9 April that the 
three persons were found to be positively affected with AIDS 
through a joint survey conducted with the District Health 
Department in March 1994. 
  Umar Hassan, who is also the third assistant of district 
social welfare office said, "We are still looking for the two 
prostitutes who are infected with AIDS. We will officially 
detain them when we find them." 
  Governor Pujono hoped that Lampung's team for the prevention 
of AIDS, which was established several months ago, would work to 
suppress the spread of the dangerous virus. 
  Pujono said, "Lampung is a transit point with a potential 
for 
the transmission of AIDS. Due to this, it is important that we 
undertake early preventive measures." 
  According to the data of the Regional Health Department, the 
two prostitutes Od (20) and Yn (28), who are affected with AIDS, 
were occupants of the service complexes at "Pemandangan" and 
"Pantai Harapan" in Panjang, Bandar Lampung, while Ys (28) was 
residing at Kalianda Welfare Board in south Lampung. 
  According to several colleagues of Od and Yn, the two had 
returned to their respective villages. They said," They had 
left for Java several days before the 1994 Id 'al-Fitr holidays 
began." They also said,"Od and Yn had been staying in the 
Panjang service complexes for the last two years. They came from 
Java together with S and R." 
  Officials of the Lampung provincial authority have directed 
that the two AIDS affected prostitutes be sought and be detained 
as an effort to prevent the spread of the disease. 
  The exposure of the HIV cases in Lampung was due to the 
survey and tests conducted from 1,119 blood samples taken 
jointly by the Regional Health Department in Lampung and 
Lampung's team for the prevention of AIDS. 
  Blood samples were taken from 142 prostitutes in 
"Pemandangan", 134 others at "Pantai Harapan", 75 persons from 
Pantai Pijat, 59 SMEA YPP students, 509 persons from Napi 
Tanjungkarang, 103 persons from Napi Kalianda, 90 SMAN Kalianda 
students and seven tourist guides, including pimps, lesbians and 
homosexuals. 
  The blood samples were taken from the high-risk and HIV 
prone 
groups and tests were conducted. The outcome of the result was 
that three persons were tested positive for HIV. 
  In compliance with the Regional Health Department's report 
to 
the governor on 17 March 1994, blood tests were conducted to 
detect the spread of the HIV virus, social diseases and syphilis. 
  According to the head of the Lampung team for the prevention 
of AIDS, Drs. Umar Hassan, the AIDS problem needs to be 
perpetually pursued. He said," We truly hope that Lampung will 
be free of prostitutes."

  [Text] Health statistics for the month of March reveal 
that 11 new cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
reported to the Department of Health (DoH). [sentence as 
published] Of the 11 cases, five have already died from the 
disease while the virus in the six other victims are in the full 
blown stage of AIDS. 
  However, the report did not specify how the victims were 
infected. AIDS is usually transmitted through sexual 
intercourse, blood transfusion or via the mother's placenta 
where babies contract the virus in their mother's womb. 
  DoH AIDS Unit Program Manager Dennis Maducdoc said more than 
half of those who were reported in the March AIDS registry are 
very young. "Most of their ages range from 15 to 29," he said. 
He also said that of the 11 cases, seven are assumed to have 
come from commercial sex workers in Angeles City where a U.S. 
organization conducted a study and found seven positive cases of 
AIDS out of the 1,767 blood samples it tested. 
  The number of HIV-AIDS victims continues to increase as the 
total number of reported cases from 1984 to February this year 
reached 494. The number of full-blown AIDS cases has already 
reached 136.

  [Excerpts] Dengue fever is on the rise again and the 
present spell of rain is making it more difficult to control its 
spread. 
  The Environment Ministry (ENV) on Wednesday called for extra 
public vigilance as the number of houses found breeding the 
dengue-spreading Aedes mosquito doubled from 372 in February to 
728 last month. 
  To date, a total of 260 cases of dengue fever have been 
reported this year, with no deaths recorded so far. 
  In the last four weeks alone, 57 cases were reported, 
compared with 12 for the same period last year. 
  An Environment Ministry spokesman said that the number of 
breedings indoors in water-bearing containers such as pails, 
jars, basins, tanks, vases and flower-pot plates had nearly 
tripled over the last month. 
  Outdoor checks had similar findings, he added. 
  Most of the breedings were found in unwanted water-bearing 
receptacles, gully traps, canvas or plastic sheets, and drains. 
[Passage omitted] 
  Another mosquito-borne threat, malaria, has also been on the 
rise, with 81 cases having been reported since the start of the 
year, compared with 50 cases for the same period last year. 
  All, except five, of this year's cases were contracted 
overseas. 
  The Environment Ministry reports that the incidence of 
imported malaria among foreign workers has been increasing. In 
1989, there were 25 cases. Last year's figure was 116. [Passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Taipei, April 23 (CNA) -- Eighteen more local 
citizens have tested positive for Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome (AIDS) antibodies, bringing the number of AIDS virus 
carriers on Taiwan to 615, the Department of Health reported on 
Saturday [23 April]. 
  Over the past eight months, 100 more AIDS virus carriers 
have 
been recorded, indicating the virus is spreading quickly 
thoroughout the island, a Department of Health official said. 
  Of the newly identified AIDS virus carriers, 15 are male and 
three female. The carriers are between 20 and 30 years old, the 
department said. 
  Among the 18 are three couples. One husband reportedly 
contracted the virus after intravenous drug use and the other 
two through sexual contact with prostitutes. 
  Five carriers were identified by the non-profit blood 
donation center, according to the department. 
  Five out of the 615 carriers recently developed AIDS-related 
complications, increasing to 110 the total number of AIDS 
patients in Taiwan.

  [Excerpts] MORE than one million people in Thailand are 
now believed to be HIV positive, according to Public Health 
Ministry statistics released yesterday. 
  Interior Ministry spokesman, Chiyakon Sesawet, said there 
are 
as many as 1.3 million HIV infected people according to the 
Public Health Ministry's statistics for February. 
  He described the figures as "very alarming." [passage 
omitted] 
  Chiyakon believed that the number of HIV cases is rising 
because 75 per cent of Thai men sleep regularly with prostitutes. 
  In addition, 44 per cent of teenage boys have their first 
sexual experience with prostitutes. 
  Chiyakon said that the Interior Ministry has set up four 
committees in response to a request from the National Aids 
Committee for a coordinated campaign to try to redress the 
alarming spread of the deadly disease. 
  The committees will take responsibility in planning, 
budgeting, public relations and analysis to ensure that the 
campaign is effective. 
  Chiyakon said the Interior Ministry has also approved a plan 
to set up Aids- free clubs in some government and state 
enterprise agencies nationwide. 
  "If the clubs prove successful in the fight against Aids, 
the 
ministry will expand the idea to cover all government and state 
agencies" he said. 
  Chiyakon said the statistics released yesterday show that 
there are 5,215 Aids patients in Thailand, 85.3 per cent of them 
men and 12.7 per cent women.
