"Astronomy": "The Ultraviolet Universe: Space Telescope Studies 
New Stars"] 
  [Text] A new space-based ultraviolet telescope designed and 
built in Israel will make it possible to penetrate the mysteries 
of the universe. That telescope--the result of the joint efforts 
of Tel-Aviv University, the Israeli Space Agency, and the firm 
ELOP--will be the "all-seeing eye" of a spacecraft that will be 
launched in 1995. Israel has received permission to participate 
in an international project involving the first science mission 
for the study of celestial objects in the ultraviolet range of 
the spectrum. 
  "We have all the necessary basic infrastructure for space 
technologies," said Ethan Reys (Eytan Reys), the head of the 
space developments division of the firm ELOP. 
  The TAUVEX telescope (TAUVEX stands for Tel-Aviv University 
UV Explorer) was developed to fill the considerable gap in our 
knowledge of the universe. Astronomers have successfully 
observed stars in a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, 
to include the visible, radio, x-ray, and infrared ranges of the 
spectrum. The ultraviolet range, however, remains accessible in 
only individual fragments. 
  "It is impossible to perform sufficiently precise 
observations in the UV spectrum from the ground, because of the 
severe scattering of UV radiation in the atmosphere," said Reys. 
"The only way to get images of distant or weak stars is to take 
the science instrumentation into space." 
  TAUVEX will be pointed at "white dwarfs" (new stars that 
emit 
high-energy UV radiation), binaries (binary stars), galaxies, 
and quasars (extremely bright objects at the edge of the 
universe). "We expect the search for quasars to be more 
productive than any other search every undertaken," said Dr. N. 
Brosh, an astronomer at the Weiss [Vays] Observatory of Tel-Aviv 
University. That observatory is the most active observatory in 
the Eastern Mediterranean. "We expect to catalog more than 
10,000 new quasars, which will be identified from their UV 
spectra. At present, only about 4,000 quasars are known from 
ground-based observations." 
  The information that will be obtained in the course of the 
mission will help scientists to have a better understanding of 
the physical nature of high-energy sources such as neutron stars 
and black holes. Using the broad-range UV telescope, scientists 
will have a unique opportunity to get to the heart of the 
process associated with the formation of stars and to ascertain 
their makeup, velocity, size, age, emittance, and position. All 
that information not only expands our knowledge of the current 
state of stars, their origin, and history, but will also help to 
predict their future. 
  The images will be obtained with three telescopes: two of 
them designed for scientific research, and the third serving as 
a position and velocity sensor for the spacecraft itself. Those 
data are very important in that producing images requires 
lengthy exposures. "The data of the third telescope will make it 
possible to reconstruct images that are blurry because of the 
long exposure while the spacecraft is moving. The information on 
direction and velocity makes it possible to produce images as if 
from an immobile platform," said Reys. 
  The spacecraft will be launched into an elliptical orbit 
with 
a maximum distance from Earth of 200,000 km and a revolution 
period of three days. Low-orbit satellites usually complete a 
revolution in an hour and a half. The satellite will function in 
orbit for three years. 
  One other unique feature of the TAUVEX system is that it 
provides a field of view that is 500 times greater than the 
field of view of the wide-angle camera of the Hubble Space 
Telescope. 
  The satellite is to be launched from the CIS. The data will 
be received at sites in Russia, but will be made accessible to 
all scientists participating in the project.

  [Abstract] The Danish Watch instrument aboard the Granat 
Observatory identified a new x-ray source on 7 August 1993. The 
flux from the source when it was first detected was 600 mCrab in 
an energy range of 8-20 keV. The instrument managed to localize 
the source to within about 1ë. The following coordinates for 
the 1950.0 epoch were recorded: _a_ = 
17[.sup]h[/]24[.sup]m[/], _b_ = 20ë43'. The radius of 
the region of localization with a level of significance of 1_s_ 
was 40 arc minutes. The source is in the Hercules constellation. 
The distance between GRS 1724+21 and the x-ray source closest to 
it (quasar V396 Her) is 4ë. The source "switched off" on 11 
August. The front of increasing intensity is considerably 
shorter than the period of decay of the light curve, and the 
light curve weakened from 7 August through 9 August. Figures 1, 
references 3: 2 Russian, 1 Western.

  [Abstract] The gravitational constant G is the 
least accurately measured of the fundamental constants. No group 
of researchers in the past decade has been able to go beyond the 
CODATA error of 10[.sup]-4[/], and three of the four 
determinations made of the absolute value of G are 
not in agreement in terms of measurement error. Sanders and 
Deeds's method, which achieved a level of 10[.sup]-6[/] in 
1992, was based on observation of the motion of two bodies of 
different mass within a blow-free satellite, with use of a 
horseshoe trajectory, i.e., the lighter object (the particle), 
lower than the heavier object, catches up with it, interacts, 
goes to a higher orbit, and then falls behind in orbital motion. 
The researchers here propose a method that salvages the 
advantages of Sanders and Deeds's and adds another: it relies on 
a precise solution for the points of equilibrium points of the 
particle in the overall field of the Earth and the libration 
points. Accuracy of measurement of G can be increased 
by two orders of magnitude. Figures 2, references 6 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Most gravitational maneuvers have involved the 
planets rather than the Moon, although as far back as 1959 the 
unmanned Luna-3 craft used lunar gravitation to produce a return 
trajectory that would be better for the transmission of images 
of the far side of the Moon. The researchers here show that a 
good number of missions to asteroids that are approaching the 
Earth's orbit can use lunar gravity to good effect, i.e., the 
fuel savings would enable larger payloads. Most profiles require 
that a velocity of 1.3-2.5 km/s be achieved, which means that 
more than 150 m/s could be saved with a lunar flyby in terms of 
characteristic velocity. The trajectory proposed would 
approximate sectors of conical sections. If used for the mission 
to the McAuliffe asteroid in the INEO project, the savings in 
characteristic velocity would be 183 m/s. Figures 3, references 
7: 5 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] An approximate analytic method is given for 
computing the motion of a spacecraft in the neighborhood of the 
collinear libration points of an arbitrary system of bodies. In 
connection with trajectory problems with the "Relikt-2" project 
(halo orbit in the neighborhood of the L[.sub]2[/] point of 
the Sun-Earth system), analytic allowance also is made for 
perturbations from the Moon. A comparison with the motion of a 
spacecraft in a halo orbit, determined by numerical integration, 
gave an estimate of the magnitude of the systematic error of 
about 1% of the characteristic amplitude of the halo 
orbit. The 
problem of the Earth's screening of a spacecraft against solar 
radiation in a halo orbit of an arbitrary amplitude is 
formulated. The proposed analytic method was used in estimating 
the expenditures of characteristic velocity on the optimum 
correction of spacecraft motion in order to prevent screening 
(in the case of the limited control system in the "Relikt-2" 
project and a more general case). Section 2 gives results 
characterizing the accuracy in approximating an asymptotic 
trajectory in the proposed third-order theory; Section 3 gives a 
formalization of the problem of entry into the Earth's shadow 
(or penumbra). Section 4 examines the optimum problem of 
correction of the motion of a spacecraft, making possible 
avoidance of its entry into a deep shadow. The analytic theory 
developed in Section 5 rests on a similar method worked out 
earlier for describing motion in the neighborhood of the 
L[.sub]2[/] point in the Earth-Moon system. Figures 11; 
references: 9 Russian.

  [Abstract] The most rapid maneuvers of a spacecraft with a 
jet engine having a great but limited thrust in a gravity field 
in a vacuum with control of the thrust vector are analyzed. Such 
maneuvers have been inadequately examined in the literature. In 
this study they are analyzed on the basis of the so-called 
maximum principle. The influence of the admissible expenditures 
of mass on the character of the optimum trajectory is examined. 
Maneuvers with both limited expenditures and those not limited 
in advance are discussed. It is shown that in each of the 
problems of most rapid maneuvers there are three levels of 
limited expenditures of mass, dependent on the parameters of the 
problem: lower, corresponding to small expenditures, for which 
the problem has no solution; upper, corresponding to large 
expenditures or those not limited in advance, in which thrust is 
operative on the entire optimum trajectory and is maximum, but 
the maneuver is controlled by the orientation vector; 
intermediate, in which there can be changes in thrust with time 
or there are repeated engine firings. A method is proposed for 
numerical solution of such problems using a compromise 
"time-expenditures of mass" functional. The dependence of the 
solution on the admissible expenditures is illustrated in the 
example of the problem of most rapid transfers of spacecraft 
between coplanar circular orbits in the Earth's central 
Newtonian gravitational field. Figures 3; references 37: 36

  [Abstract] New methodological possibilities are described 
for using satellites to ascertain the glow characteristics of 
auroras and the electrodynamic characteristics of the polar 
ionosphere which are afforded by an on-board imaging system when 
using the new "Monochromatic Eye" objective; two annotated 
optical diagrams of this objective (for the visible and vacuum 
UV spectral ranges) accompany the text and serve as a basis for 
the detailed textual description. One of the variants for 
constructing a system of wide-angle quasimonochromatic imaging 
cameras for a low-apogee satellite of the "Meteor-3M" type is 
analyzed and the different advantages which it affords for 
studying processes in the polar ionosphere are considered. 
Another diagram shows the geometry of spectrophotometric 
measurements of auroral characteristics from a satellite when 
using wide-angle monochromatic imaging cameras, fully explained 
in the text. The aeronomic characteristics of the upper 
atmosphere are determined more precisely when using these 
satellite- borne instruments. The possibilities of satellite 
registry of the influence of seismic effects on the glow of 
atmospheric emissions are examined. Such observations would be 
invaluable in active coordinated experiments. The premises for 
further development of an imaging system for studying the 
atmospheres and ionospheres of other planets from space 
vehicles, as well as for surface panoramic photometric 
observations of auroras, are discussed. A series of tables gives 
all pertinent technical specifications. Figures 3; references 
53: 45 Russian, 8 Western.

  [Abstract] The concept of small autonomous (self-contained) 
space vehicles is outlined. They are intended for performing 
research and other functions after separation from a mother 
spacecraft. They would be useful for delivering instruments to a 
planetary surface from a fly-by craft or into open space, 
placement of communication satellites in a stipulated region, 
creation of artificial formations of the sodium cloud type, and 
other purposes. The principal requirements imposed on them, the 
parameters and most probable ways to construct such vehicles are 
examined. Their linkage with, separation from and interaction 
with the mother craft are discussed. One of the main problems, 
considering the very limited size and mass of these small 
vehicles, is an electric current source of a different type than 
usually employed. Pyrotechnic sources, having a great number of 
advantages, are proposed as a solution which is both realistic 
and efficient. A block diagram of such a vehicle supplied with 
pyrotechnic launch and control systems is given in which all 
operations are performed without external sources of electric 
energy. A list of pertinent newly developed functional groups of 
pyrotechnic devices (triggering, relaying, programming, 
generating, signal conversion and actuating systems) is given. 
As an example, a diagram and technical specifications are given 
for a pyrotechnic generator which can be used on such autonomous 
vehicles. The NPO Lavochkin has developed designs for a small 
vehicle in which these principles are incorporated. Figures 3; 
references 7: 5 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] The asteroid Toutatis, which passed near the 
Earth in December 1992, was used as the basis for an analysis of 
the results that could be produced by sending a spacecraft on a 
collision course with an asteroid, thereby preventing a 
collision between the Earth and the asteroid. The researchers, 
in the first half of the article, examine the effect of the 
collision on the basis of model parameters. In the second half, 
they perform a more refined ballistics analysis for parameter 
that are near actual. An asteroid with a diameter of 1 km could 
be deflected some 3,000 km from the Earth for each asteroid 
orbit by a spacecraft with an orbital mass of 1,000 tons.

  [Abstract] Although a number of planetary bodies in the 
solar system are riddled with meteorite craters, current notions 
of the processes of formation that are associated with impact 
craters are quite varied. Questions associated with the impact 
of solids and with crater formation are also important in 
planetology for studying planetary-surface structure and the 
cosmogony of the solar system in general. That is why the study 
of impact phenomena with physical and mathematical modeling 
makes such an important contribution to our understanding of the 
nature of craters and to the solution of problems involving the 
danger meteorites present to spacecraft. The researchers here 
examine high-velocity impact on homogenous surfaces, as well as 
on layered surfaces, with a broad range of equations of state 
for matter surrounding solid, liquid, and gases phases. Aspects 
of the laboratory modeling of such impacts with laser pulses are 
also studied. Figures 5, references 7 (Russian).

"Russian Granat Satellite Wins Records to the Joy of Scientists 
Throughout the World"; the first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] Satellites, like people, experience both sad and 
happy fates. The Granat, a satellite constructed by the NPO 
Lavochkin, was probably the luckiest of all those Russian 
satellites intended for exoatmospheric astronomy. According to 
the guarantees, it was to operate for only 8 months, but it is 
already in its fifth year and to the joy of its constructors it 
is transmitting ever-newer results. 
  The Granat, providing world scientists with the most 
different discoveries, recently discovered two objects which are 
of burning interest for modern astronomy: these are so-called 
binary X-ray sources. One of them is a black hole, whereas the 
second is a "donor," a supplier of matter for it. These objects, 
by analogy with ordinary astronomy, were called X-ray novae. 
Visualize that in the course of a single day an X-ray source 
flares up which becomes one of the brightest in the X-radiation 
range. Its luminosity increases for several days. The optical 
telescopes register in its place a star which is simultaneously 
increasing its brightness by a factor of 1000; there also is a 
great increase in its radio emission. 
  A Granat sensation was the first experimental discovery of 
several regions of annihilation of positrons and electrons in 
the universe, that is, encounters of matter and antimatter. 
Earlier this was only a conclusion drawn by theoreticians, a 
postulated but not fully demonstrated phenomenon. The French 
feel that this result alone justifies all their expenditures on 
the development and construction of the Sigma telescope carried 
aboard the satellite which has a mass of an entire ton and which 
cost 200 million francs. 
  A mysterious region attracting scientists is the center of 
our Galaxy, always shrouded in dense clouds. Many have assumed 
that hidden behind them there is a massive black hole with 
several millions of solar masses. The Granat removed the curtain 
of secrecy. The clouds are no hindrance for X-rays and over the 
course of four years the Russian Artpe telescope tracked the 
center of the Galaxy. 
  "We registered weak variable X-radiation of the center of 
our 
Galaxy," says Academician R. Syunyayev, scientific director of 
the experiment with the Granat observatory. "But the radiation 
was much less than the radiation of the typical center of an 
active galaxy. Possibly for some reason our `black hole' is not 
being fed. It is not precluded that new surprises may be 
discovered at any time. The Granat is continuing its brilliantly 
successful flight, exhibiting a surprising longevity for the 
very complex and costly ensemble of scientific instruments and 
the satellite itself."

  [Abstract] At present, the gravitational constant 
G is known to an accuracy of four significant figures 
only, i.e., G = (6.67259+/-0.00085) x 
10[.sup]-11[/] m[.sup]3[/] kg[.sup]-1[/] 
s[.sup]-2[/]. Small spherical objects with inert masses of 
m[.sub]0[/] and m are usually used to 
ascertain G, but they cannot be launched into open 
space, because too many factors produce disturbing influences. 
The objects, therefore, must be contained in a shell that 
protects them from such factors. The researchers here point to 
the wisdom of using so-called quasisatellite orbits for the 
work. The properties of those orbits are described with 
perturbation theory and the calculation of periodic 
quasisatellite orbits. In the latter case, only periodic orbits 
with a rather large number of intersections k possess 
the typical properties of quasisatellite orbits of the general 
type. Perturbation theory enables the determination of the 
approximate values of the initial parameters for orbits with 
specific properties, i.e., a given number of intersections 
k and given minimum and maximum separations of 
m[.sub]0[/] and m. Figures 12,

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Chernobrov: "Next Stop -- `Asteroid Belt'"] </F>
  [Text] It is as simple to enumerate the stages in the 
development of cosmonautics as it is easy to foresee the further 
route of attack in the song "We took Warsaw by storm, passed 
through the entire city and read the last street name . . . ." 
In actuality, man is moving into the unbounded expanses of the 
universe in short careful jumps. First we launched 
reconnaissance vehicles into space, then to the closest 
celestial body -- the moon, and only then to the planets in a 
strict sequence, depending on the range. And landings of space 
vehicles on these bodies took place in the same sequence, none 
were skipped: Moon (1959), Venus (1966), Mars (1971). The next 
in turn, with the numbers "5" and "6," were Mercury and Jupiter, 
but the closest of all was "number 4" -- not a planet, but 
something like a real jumble, a mass of space trash known as the 
"asteroid belt." 
  So, in any case, it was thought earlier. In the past century 
astronomers noticed an empty unoccupied place between Mars and 
Jupiter, wanted to discover a planet there, but instead found . 
. . thousands of fragments. Arguments about their origin are 
still continuing: these are either remnants of the exploding 
planet Phaeton or "semifinished material" -- nonadhering pieces 
for constructing a planetary body. The arguing parties agreed on 
only one thing: it was assumed that the asteroid belt would not 
allow the passage of spaceships because they inevitably would 
collide with some small piece of rock, which at great velocities 
is equivalent to an encounter with a land mine. But now four 
emissaries from the Earth have passed through this mine field 
and the fifth is in flight. And this demonstrates that the Earth 
is not at all blocked from outer space by an impenetrable wall. 
Breathing more calmly, specialists already intended to forget 
about the irritating interference on the path to the giant 
planets, but . . . . 
  . . . But the scientists of the Moscow Aviation Institute 
and 
Hesse University (FRG), meeting together, thought a little and 
decided that the minor planets, of which the asteroid belt 
consists, is of enormous interest for science. In actuality, 
whereas ordinary planets during the billions of years of 
evolution, as a result of strong gravitational compression, 
internal heating and chemical reactions, have not retained a 
trace of the primordial matter of the protoplanetary cloud, on 
the tiny cosmic bodies, with a total absence of an atmosphere, 
any matter should be preserved almost eternally. 
  If we learn the composition of these space "preserves" and 
compare it with today's state of the Earth's deeper layers, many 
geological riddles about our own planet will become 
understandable. It is one thing to trace changes in the Earth 
over the course of tens of years and something else to learn 
about events which occurred billions of years ago. It appears 
that for geologists it is far more important to make a a soil 
analysis for asteroids, absolutely dissimilar to the Earth, than 
for planets similar to ours. 
  Such a thought is evident for scientists throughout the 
world. In any case, this was true at a second Russian-German 
conference held recently in Moscow and devoted to these 
problems, attended by specialists from the United States, Great 
Britain, Italy, France and Japan. It goes without saying that it 
is not enough to study these space stones; it is necessary to 
know further how to get our hands on this material itself. The 
fact is that the ordinary chemical rocket engines by means of 
which all our flights into space have been made have now already 
almost attained the peak of their possibilities. The farther we 
glance into space, the more we sense our helplessness. Flight 
with modern engines to the outskirts of the solar system may 
last for tens of years. Is it possible to fly by developing a 
higher-velocity engine and getting to the goal sooner? 
  Most of the conferees see an electric rocket engine as such 
an alternative. And among all the proposed variants the most 
advantageous proved to be the following variant: the body of the 
spacecraft, scientific equipment and instruments are to be 
fabricated by the Lavochkin Plant, Messerschmidt and other 
European concerns. As a booster for entry into orbit it was 
decided to use our Proton, but as the power plant for the entire 
complex -- a Topaz nuclear reactor. The engine also was 
selected. Here the plasma accelerator proved to be ahead of all 
the rest. 
  When the entire world learned of the invention of this new 
class of accelerators by Professor Aleksey Morozov in the 
1970's, it was decided that the results of the experiments be 
put to practical use at once. Now, however, when the time had 
come to compare the results and simultaneously lay out on the 
table the tens of reports on the tests, an objective jury gave 
preference to the quasistationary P50A "Giperboloid" 
accelerator, constructed at the Scientific Research Institute of 
Applied Mechanics and Electrodynamics of the Moscow Aviation 
Institute. Gari Popov, scientific research institute director, 
was extremely restrained in his evaluations. He declared to a 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI corespondent that he had no doubt about the 
competence of his specialists, they dealt beautifully with the 
scientific-production problems but ahead was the most difficult 
stage of marketing and sale of products with a high scientific 
content, which remains unmastered by the Russians. 
  In actuality, whereas in purely technical knowledge Russian 
and Ukrainian scientists have simply had no equals, our 
professors, to speak bluntly, have not been too brilliant in 
elementary entrepreneurship. Petr Tsygankov, a specialist at the 
Technical University imeni Bauman, after the next report of 
foreign luminaries, bitterly joked: "Everything on which they 
are working there, that which they only intend to do after many 
years and on which they are spending millions of dollars, 
already has long gathered dust on the shelf in our country. Let 
them come to us, for 10 000 we will not only blow dust from an 
absolutely finished item, but also wrap it up . . . ." 
  To be sure, the funding of our science, which is extremely 
far from ideal, is responsible for all. So is it possible to 
advise our specialists to leave space at rest, so to speak, to 
better times? Especially since the accumulated experience is 
sufficient for fully satisfying "terrestrial" orders. Due to all 
these same space technologies the Applied Mechanics and 
Electrodynamics Scientific Research Institute now can perform 
the spraying of virtually any material on any base. Imagine for 
yourself what a scope this gives production people. The 
Americans have already acquired such apparatus in our country 
for the spraying of gold; now they are looking very closely at 
the "plasma boiler" made in Moscow. 
  But the greatest stroke of luck for scientists is 
unquestionably the contracts from which they will receive 
well-deserved money for ... their principal work -- the 
designing of space equipment. Indeed, whereas in economic fields 
there are an enormous number of competitors, there are not many 
who prefer to deal with superdistant space flights -- they are 
technically too complex. 
  Judge for yourselves: approximately in the year 2000 an 18-m 
spacecraft with a nuclear reactor and as a minimum five engines 
sets off on its trajectory with a constant acceleration. After 
two years it will approach the asteroids, each time even out its 
velocity near each body, select the most typical from among 
them, release a descent module to reach its surface, which then, 
using a liquid-propellant rocket engine, will return to the 
Earth. The nuclear ship itself, however, will wander in space, 
seeking out and studying newer and newer celestial bodies as 
long as the fuel in its reactor suffices. 
  In the opinion of Gari Popov, the planned mission is so 
multiaspect that the ship intended for it can fully execute a 
flight to virtually any place in the solar system. Bartelli 
Chezeri, a representative of the European Space Agency, revealed 
the secret that his organization already has on hand 53 
proposals for making flights into distant space for different 
scientific missions: study of the satellites of Jupiter, the 
rings of Saturn, search for gravity waves, neutrinos, etc. And 
this means that they can be regarded as potential orders for the 
planned vehicle, which in turn, could become the first 
standard-produced general-purpose ship for the solar system. 
  Europe feels that Russia is the best candidate for carrying 
out such an interplanetary mission. But will Russian scientists 
live to see its beginning? Recently, incidentally, they learned 
that ordinary aluminum spoons from a student's dining table, 
covered with gold in space engines, can be sold to cooperative 
kiosks. It is true that there are no forks. They have already 
disappeared for three years from Moscow institutes. But there 
are so many spoons that I am calm for Russian space science and 
industry. They will suffice right up to the year 2000.

  [Abstract] The already demonstrated effectiveness of the 
Etalon passive geodetic satellites is further discussed. They 
were launched for increasing the accuracy in determining and 
predicting the parameters of motion of vehicles in the GLONASS 
system, refining geodynamic parameters and constructing 
corresponding models of these geodynamic parameters. Refined 
models based on Etalon observations can represent an improvement 
over models now used for the GLONASS system and can be used in 
constructing a highly precise model of the nongravitational 
forces acting on navigational satellites, as well as in solving 
problems directly related to increasing the accuracy 
characteristics of the GLONASS system. It is believed that this 
will make it possible to solve a wide range of geophysical 
problems: refinement of fundamental geophysical and astronomical 
constants, construction of a model of the internal structure of 
the Earth and formulation of a theory of its rotation. A table 
gives the characteristics of the Etalon passive spacecraft. The 
observations made it possible to construct a highly precise 
model of motion of passive spacecraft taking the following 
perturbations into account: Earth's gravitational potential, 
gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun, gravitational 
attraction of Venus and possibly Jupiter; pressure of direct 
solar radiation and that reflected from the Earth. The Etalon 
passive spacecraft in the future can be used for solving all 
problems within the framework of the GLONASS system and for 
increasing the accuracy of fundamental geophysical and 
astronomical parameters. The means by which these goals can be 
most effectively attained are outlined.

  [Abstract] The passive spacecraft (PSC) Etalon-1 and 
Etalon-2 were launched into a high circular orbit in 1989 for 
geodetic and geophysical research. Immediately after the launch 
Glavkosmos began measurements of the laser ranges to the PSC. 
The observation network consisted of Ternopol and Yevpatoriya in 
the west and Maydanak, in the high mountains, in the east. 
Observations were made only at nighttime in the entire part of 
the visible arc each 30 minutes. During 1989-1990 ten foreign 
stations were incorporated into the network (all but one in the 
northern hemisphere). In the preliminary processing stage 
corrections were introduced into the measurements to take 
atmospheric refraction into account without the humidity 
component and reduction to the center of mass. The accuracy of 
laser measurements of range by Glavkosmos instruments is 25 cm, 
but by foreign stations it is a few centimeters. The principal 
perturbations for the Etalon orbits were gravitational 
attraction of the Earth, Moon, Sun, planets and radiation 
pressure. But accuracy requirements dictated allowance for the 
influence of solar system planets, higher order geopotential 
harmonics and solar radiation in the shaded sectors of the orbit 
and radiation reflected from the Earth. Table 1 gives the 
results of processing of PSC observations. The consistent 
parameters of the constructed model of motion made it possible 
to decrease the errors in predicting the parameters of motion of 
the Etalon PSC by a factor of 1 1/2-2. This model affords a 
possibility for evaluating different effects such as the 
influence of solar radiation pressure in shaded sectors of the 
orbit with allowance for refraction and absorption by the 
Earth's atmosphere and the influence of radiation reflected from 
the Earth, taking into account the seasonal-latitudinal change 
in albedo and other small perturbations.

  [Abstract] The accuracy in evaluating navigational 
determinations using satellite radionavigation systems of the 
GLONASS and GPS type is usually ascertained using an analytic 
method. In this study the evaluation of special cases is made 
using a numerical method. For this purpose a study was made of 
the law of distribution of the geometry factor in the case of an 
equiprobable distribution of observation points over the Earth's 
surface and observation times and then with a fixed value of the 
geometry factor an estimate was made of the accuracy in 
determining coordinates with any set of measurement errors and 
positions of the observed satellites. The geometry factor 
distribution law for each situation and the determinations of 
position in the course of the day (at 0.5-hour intervals) were 
simulated at points uniformly distributed over the surface of 
the northern hemisphere. The series of geometry factor values 
obtained from modeling was about 100 000 determinations of 
position for each case, represented by 10 levels. Modeling of 
determinations of coordinates was carried out with allowance for 
relief data taken from a 1:100 000 map. A table gives the rms 
errors in determining coordinates, averaged vertically and 
horizontally over the Earth's surface, as a function of the 
accuracy in measuring pseudorange and the accuracy of satellite 
position in orbit. The rms error in determining position in open 
terrain when using the standard number of navigation satellites 
(4.2) is about 13 m; the minimum error is about 6 m and the 
maximum error is about 30 m. Position accuracy drops in the 
event of failure of individual system satellites. In the event 
of operation of 18 satellites the minimum, mean and maximum rms 
errors are 10, 21 and 400 m respectively. If half the satellites 
fail in 50% of the cases the problem has no solution.

  [Abstract] The problem examined is a reduction of the 
distorting influence of the atmosphere due to the refraction of 
radio waves on electronic measurements of the parameters of 
vehicular motion: the atmospheric refraction correction problem. 
The theory of the problem is examined. The method proposed for 
most effective solution of the problem is an iteration scheme 
for taking into account tropospheric refraction corrections 
which operates on the principle of successive (step-by-step) 
refinement of the influence of the troposphere on electronic 
measurements of the range to the spacecraft and its radial 
velocity of motion. A block diagram of the method is given. In 
the first step the correction of electronic measurements is made 
on the basis of the surface value of the atmospheric refractive 
index without using a tropospheric model. The second step, based 
on the surface value of the refractive index and an exponential 
model of the troposphere, yields refraction corrections with 
allowance for the real values of the electronic measurements of 
range and velocity. The use of direct measurement data makes it 
possible to take the real influence of the troposphere partially 
into account. The third step, based on application of an 
algorithm for the inversion of experimental data from electronic 
measurements, makes it possible to determine the vertical 
profile of the troposphere corresponding to its real state. This 
makes it possible to predict highly accurate refraction 
corrections for electronic measurements. Specific information is 
given on the accuracies achieved. These determinations can be 
used in effectively solving problems in space geodesy and 
radionavigation. Variants of the method are discussed. Figures

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Leskov; "Russian Cosmonautics, It Seems </F>
To Be Surviving. But Western Contracts Constitute Its Principal 
Capital"] 
  [Text] During recent months the principal events in 
cosmonautics have not been occurring in orbit, but in government 
offices. Indeed, as never before the fate of cosmonautics is 
dependent not so much on successful technical solutions as on 
the good will of the politicians. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister of Russia, and Albert 
Gore, vice president of the United States, in December 1993 
signed an executive agreement on joint work on the Alpha orbital 
station. Late in March 1994 Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president 
of Kazakhstan, and Boris Yeltsin, president of Russia, signed an 
agreement on the manner of operation of the Baykonur cosmodrome. 
Despite the outward unrelated character of these two agreements, 
they are closely linked to one another and in the absence of one 
of them the other becomes senseless. 
  Observers are unanimous that the final protocol of the 
agreement with Kazakhstan is advantageous for Russia, which 
succeeded in sticking by virtually all its interests. The 
military personnel of the Military Space Forces of Russia will 
even service the cosmodrome, located in the territory of another 
country. The term of the lease, 20 years, with subsequent 
renewal for another 10 years, also corresponds to the needs of 
Russia. And finally, the lease payment of 115 million dollars 
annually, instead of the 150 million asked for by Kazakhstan, 
evidently will not be too burdensome for Russia because some of 
the money will be recouped in space services. 
  Why during the prolonged conflict about Baykonur has Russia 
held out this way for the cosmodrome, lost in the waterless 
steppes, and has more than once placed the good relations with 
Kazakhstan in danger? It is not at all due to nostalgic memories 
of the glorious past of Soviet cosmonautics, which was 
associated with this place. Administration of Baykonur is an 
endless headache. Everything there is falling down, everything 
needs major repairs. Specialists dissatisfied with their fate 
are working there and serious troop mutinies flare up. But 
despite all the problems only Baykonur can really ensure the 
survival of Russian cosmonautics. 
  However, Russia also has the Plesetsk cosmodrome in 
Arkhangelsk Oblast. Already long ago more satellites were 
launched from the nine launch pads at Plesetsk than from 
Baykonur. The Soyuz, Molniya, Tsiklon and Cosmos boosters, which 
put ten kinds of scientific and economic satellites into orbit, 
are launched from there. Most of the military satellites are 
launched from Plesetsk. One shortcoming is that Plesetsk today 
cannot service large boosters of the Energiya, Proton and Zenit 
types. And it is precisely these boosters which constitute the 
main hope of the space branch under conditions of a general 
economic decline. It is precisely these boosters which are 
attracting the attention of the Western partners of Russia and 
promise a vitally necessary inflow of contracts and foreign 
exchange. 
  During the last month Russian military people have 
insistently advanced the idea of constructing a new cosmodrome, 
"Svobodnyy-18," at a base of the former rocket army near 
Komsomolsk-na-Amure. This idea has its advantages. First of all, 
the geographical location, in latitude close to Baykonur. In the 
case of a launch from the northern site at Plesetsk 
10-15% more 
fuel is expended than in the case of a launch into the same 
orbit from Baykonur or from "Svobodnyy." In addition, the 
closeness of "Svobodnyy" to the southeastern region, whose 
countries have recently expressed increasingly active interest 
in their own space research, is attractive. But Russia is faced 
with building a new cosmodrome with a near-empty treasury. As a 
result of the remoteness of the Russian Far East each stone at 
such a cosmodrome, as stated by Boris Ostroumov, deputy director 
of the Russian Space Agency, will be more costly than a diamond. 
  Soviet cosmonautics, however insistently the official 
propaganda conveyed the idea that it had exclusively peaceful 
purposes, at all times was structurally a component part of the 
defense industry. It is precisely this which explains why 
cosmonautics in the USSR never experienced difficulties with 
funding and all programs invariably were discussed in the 
Military-Industrial Commission of the USSR Council of Ministers. 
It is not at all surprising that together with the entire 
defense establishment cosmonautics also was plunged into a deep 
crisis. By 1993 up to 40% of the personnel had departed 
from a 
branch where elite specialists traditionally worked. It is 
impossible to estimate the scales of hidden unemployment; at 
many enterprises a shortened work week has been introduced and 
specialists are on unpaid leaves for a long time. One can only 
guess about budgeted funding because the money is doled out 
quarterly and is received with a great delay, already being 
devalued. World-level scientists are making both ends meet by 
concluding contracts for small household appliances having 
nothing in common with science. 
  On the other side of the ocean the American space program 
has 
encountered its difficulties. Ten billion dollars have already 
been spent on developing the Freedom orbital station, but it has 
not been possible to arrive at a final version. Settling down in 
the White House, president B. Clinton demanded a sharp reduction 
in the funding for this ambitious project. In March 1993 the 
idea was first expressed that there should be close cooperation 
in space research between Russia and the United States, formerly 
steering clear of one another. The swiftness in concluding an 
agreement is attributable only to the desperation in which the 
leaders of world cosmonautics found themselves. 
  The agreement, to run for four years, provides for orders 
worth 400 million dollars to be placed at Russian space 
enterprises. This sum guarantees work for 60-70 thousand 
persons. Construction of the Alpha orbital station is to begin 
in 1997; it will operate as a minimum up to 2010, which also 
will enable Russia to receive advantageous orders in the future. 
Provision is made for flights of Russian cosmonauts in the Space 
Shuttle and American astronauts in the Mir. The first flight of 
the Americans is planned for the spring of 1995 and it will last 
for several months. It must be said that the access of the 
Americans to the methods used in long-term flights and life 
support systems is causing acute arguments among Russian 
specialists desiring to keep their first place in this field. 
  At the same time, an agreement was reached between the NPO 
Khrunichev and the Lockheed Corporation, very large enterprises 
in their respective countries, on commercial launches of the 
world's most reliable Proton booster, and a number of other 
contracts of a more local character have been signed. In 
concluding an agreement with INMARSAT on the launch of a 
communication satellite for 36 million dollars, Russia broke the 
monopoly on these services held by the French Ariane Space 
Corporation, which demanded 60 million for this launch. 
  With each passing month it is becoming increasingly evident 
that in the multiheaded Russian military-industrial complex, 
which is in a state of rapid decline, it is the space branch 
which is breathing easiest of all. Among many of the pioneers of 
cosmonautics the prospects of the branch being dependent on 
Western subsidies is a source of irritation. With an involuntary 
sigh it is possible to answer with the words of Yuriy Koptev, 
the director of the Russian Space Agency: 
  "Our dilemma is simple: either bring large-scale space 
research to a halt with time or join in with international 
cooperation, which, incidentally, the entire civilized world 
prefers."

<F P=106> [Article by Valentin Khalin: "Businessmen: Tear Into </F>
Space!"; the first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] A scheduled International Scientific and Practical 
Conference "Businessmen and the Economic Exploitation of Space" 
will be held on 12 April, on Cosmonautics Day, in the 
Trade-Industrial Hall of the Russian Federation. The fifth in 
number, it, like the preceding four, was organized on the 
initiative of Viktor Shchekochikhin, owner of the Zemlyane 
Business Cooperation Association, president of the Russian Union 
of Private Property Owners. Valentin Khalin, a DELOVOY MIR 
reviewer, converses with V. Shchekochikhin: 
  "Viktor Vladimirovich," I addressed him, "allow me a leading 
question: is a measure directed to the stars appropriate under 
the conditions of the present-day economic decline?" 
  "It is more than appropriate! Incidentally with the 
implementation of space programs we are capable of dragging the 
sick Russian economy from the quagmire. A simple example. Once 
at the NPO Molniya they showed me several stunning innovations. 
These were, in particular, technological know-how projects for 
the processing of vegetables and fruits, meat and milk products. 
Such as Western soothsayers could not have dreamed of! Competent 
engineering execution and a minimum of investment and we will 
have excellent food products, losses in taking in the harvest, 
transport and storage of agricultural products will be reduced 
to zero. Is that not worth the candle for enterprising parties?" 
  "Another example. Space communication is five or six times 
cheaper than cable or radio relay communication. Taking the 
far-outlying provinces of our country into account, is it not 
advantageous for businessmen and for local administrators to 
invest capital in a promising, profitable business?" 
  "Experience has shown that the practical use of space 
research yields a significant saving and the invested funds are 
recouped in 5-7 years. For example, exploration for natural 
resources of the land and ocean from space is capable of 
ensuring a profit of about 7 rubles from 1 ruble of investment. 
You have to ask yourself, why have a prospector drill holes at 
random in the search for gold-bearing deposits if it is 
possible, by investing capital, to receive clues from space? Or 
consider the fishing enterprise. For weeks a ship explores the 
depths of the sea until a school of fish is found. Is it also 
not better to spend some money and receive reconnaissance 
information from space?" 
  "So that is why our association twice a year -- on the Day 
of 
the First Satellite and on the Day of the First Cosmonaut -- 
holds business meetings of scientists and entrepreneurs." 
  "You have convinced me, and I hope, the reader as well. But 
are the big money-bags taking the bait?" 
  "I can't say that the Zemlyane telephone is ringing off the 
hook. Nevertheless, from conference to conference, over the 
course of two and one-half years, there has been an undeviating 
increase in the ranks of enthusiasts for a breakthrough into 
space. Our future is there. In addition to the conversion of 
high technologies on the ground, in the future it is necessary 
to look for entry into airless space with entire factories -- 
metallurgical, biomedical, for the processing of radioactive and 
other wastes. Yes, and cosmogonic problems also enter the field 
of view of scientists in the process of exploitation of 
circumterrestrial space. Man has entered near space, but already 
there are projects for flights to other planets. They require 
the efforts of many countries. Those entrepreneurs who even 
today are making efforts to partake of the space `pie' are in an 
advantageous position in comparison with those who are standing 
by idly. For example, consider America. There a great many 
private companies, large and not very large, are successfully 
competing with the government space complex. The same situation 
prevails in most countries which have joined in space research. 
For example, last autumn, together with representatives of the 
Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of the Russian 
Federation, I visited Spain to study this experience. There the 
national space program is financed for the most part by private 
companies. And we Russians, are we any less?" 
  "In the conference program among its participants I see a 
whole constellation of distinguished scientists, cosmonauts and 
entrepreneurs: Gennadiy Alferenko, director of the 
Europe-America Space Transfer Project, Vladimir Bashmachnikov, 
president of the Farming Association, Yuriy Koptev, general 
director of the Russian Space Agency, along with Konstantin 
Borovoy, as well as Nikolay Rukavishnikov, president of the 
Russian Cosmonautics Federation, Stanislav Smirnov, president of 
the Russian Federation TPP, and Oleg Gartsev, board director of 
the Merchants and Industrialists Society. But will the 
authorities participate?" 
  "There also will be official representatives, in particular, 
with a report on the prospects for the commercialization of 
space research. The conference will take place during the day of 
12 April at the Trade- Industrial Hall and in the evening its 
participants are invited to a solemn session on the occasion of 
Cosmonautics Day. Russian society is coming to the 
understanding: the state space program along is unable to cover 
the infinitude of required investments. The organizing committee 
of the scientific-practical conference proposes that 
businessmen, insurance companies, commercial banks and 
representatives of regional administrations be ready to enter 
into contact with specialists working on commercial projects in 
the field of high technologies and materials, ecology, 
monitoring and study of natural resources, space communications 
and medicine..." 
  "It must be surmised that they will not come out of simple 
curiosity; they will be seeking for themselves sources of 
financing for commercial cosmonautics. And they will not be 
losers. Their investments will pay for themselves a hundredfold."

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Kirtser, under the rubric "Russian </F>
Cosmodrome": "Plesetsk Could Take Over Baykonur's Program If the 
Money Were Provided for That"; first paragraph is source 
introduction] 
  [Text] Yesterday, KOMMERSANT DAILY correspondent 
Mikhail Kirtser returned from the Arkhangelsk province, where, 
in the middle of the forest, stands the Russian cosmodrome 
Plesetsk, used exclusively for 30 years for military purposes 
and officially called a state testing ground. For the first time 
ever, the commander of the strategic missile forces allowed 
Russian journalists in, demonstrating for them the latest 
strategic Topol missiles (SS-25), as well as how a missile 
regiment is trained. 
  During the training sessions, the photocorrespondents 
practically begged the missilemen to raise an intercontinental 
missile to the vertical position. But the military officials 
explains that that procedure is irreversible: a missile can 
assume the ready position only if the "launch" command is 
received. The press decided not to continue insisting. Instead, 
they were able to observe the passage of missiles and support 
vehicles and the camouflaging of a launcher at the ready 
position in the forest. Then, this correspondent went to the 
training center, where maintenance warrant officers and officers 
were being trained. 
  The Plesetsk cosmodrome is a whole complex of the most 
varied 
of buildings and structures. A missile regiment for mobile 
strategic missiles whose training was observed by 
representatives of the press was only part of that complex. 
There are also ground launch pads that are automatically 
associated with the now-foreign Baykonur. In fact, we couldn't 
peek into the missile silos -- their hatches can be wheeled open 
with a special mechanism only (whose operation could be "noted" 
by the press and by orbiting reconnaissance satellites) -- but 
instead were able to check out a railway-based missile system 
(in February, KOMMERSANT DAILY wrote about an accident that 
occurred with that same system). 
  The true purpose of the invitation of the journalists was 
explained at the concluding press conference, which took place 
in the closed city of Mirnyy, near the cosmodrome. The head of 
the testing ground, Lt. Gen. Yuriy Zhuravlev, declared that he 
felt it was wrong to split up the countries missile forces into 
strategic missile forces, military-space forces, and active 
ballistic missile defense forces. In his opinion, such a 
division only complicates management and increases the costs of 
maintaining those forces. The lieutenant-general also declared 
that the capabilities of the testing ground are such that, 
without any additional reoutfitting, it could not only maintain 
the combat readiness of the strategic missile forces, but also 
take over the civilian space programs from the Baykonur 
cosmodrome (especially since Mirnyy is the site of a 
concentration of scientific institutions whose intellectual 
potential has made it possible to produce a high level of 
efficiency and reliability for Russian space hardware). There's 
only one problem -- not enough money.

<F P=106> [Article by Valentin Khalin, Moscow-based reviewer for </F>
DELOVOY MIR, under the rubric "Entrepreneurship": "A Commercial 
Wheel for the Space Wagon"; first paragraph is source 
introduction] 
  [Text] The Russian aerospace complex is ill. Total 
financial dependence on state subsidies in the context of the 
current budget deficit is cutting off the wings of new projects 
before they even get off the ground. Meanwhile, unlike medicine 
for the human body, the medicine for the industry's body has 
long been found. It is commercialization of the aerospace 
programs. 
<H5>  How "They" Set Things Up </H5>
  In the United States, for example, under conditions of 
rather 
strict secrecy, the job of developing the commercial sphere of 
the space program was conferred on NASA from the very beginning. 
As far as 10 years back, an entire Department of Commercial 
Programs was set up for that. That department created the 
Strategic Plan for the Commercialization of Space, which was 
designed to cover 25 years. In that same year of 1984, the U.S. 
Congress approved a law for the development of commercial 
operations associated with the use of space transportation 
systems. We note parenthetically that, in the previous decades, 
the reliance was primarily on communications systems. Then came 
a succession of commercial uses of launch vehicles. 
  In a word, without getting into detail, one can state that 
the enlistment of commercial structures in the exploration of 
near-Earth space was, from the beginning, "their" program goal. 
With that, they killed two birds with one stone: "Deriving 
economic benefit for all the people and raising the quality of 
life on Earth," plus "encouraging investment in the space 
program from the private sector." The quotation marks here house 
the actual words from the 11 February 1988 directive of the U.S. 
president on the commercial space initiative. 
  In the West, as we know, the return on space investment is 
$3-15 for every dollar invested. 
<H5>  Our Domestic Draft </H5>
  The draft was drawn up as the State Space Program for the 
Period Ending in the Year 2000 by the Russian Space Agency (RKA) 
and the Russian Academy of Sciences, along with interested 
ministries and departments. Everything, it seems, was provided 
for in the draft. First, the basic principles were enunciated: 
competitive development and independent advisory councils for 
the projects; program-specific planning based on alternatives; 
economically efficient combination of unique, uniform, standard 
elements; compliance with legal regulations and improvement of 
the regulatory system; and regular informing of the public of 
the plans and results of space activity. Second, spheres of 
application were enumerated -- from communications and 
television broadcasting to systems for defense and the transfer 
of scientific-technical and technological achievements to other 
sectors of the economy. There was talk of the introduction of 
those achievements to the world market. 
  And not just talk. Our aerospace complex is a dainty morsel 
to foreign business circles. Under acute financial strain, 
Russian enterprises were forced to sell unique know-how to 
Western partners. NPO Energiya, for example, sold its spacecraft 
rendezvous and docking system; the KB [design bureau] Salyut and 
the Scientific Research Institute Khimmash sold the technology 
for producing a cryogenic oxygen-hydrogen engine; and the Yuriy 
Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center sold the system for screening, 
training, and post-mission adaptation of cosmonauts. 
  The entry into the world market is basically a good thing. 
But with the investment into our aerospace complex, things are 
worse. Domestic private and joint-stock capital, because of its 
rudimentary nature and weakness, is not rushing to open its 
purse strings. And the West is in even less of a hurry. After 
all, foreign partners are trying to sell their own products to 
us. Aircraft of the well-known Sergey Ilyushin aircraft complex, 
the Il-96M and the multipurpose Il-103, are being outfitted with 
the motors of two American firms. 
  What to do? How can the entrepreneurs of Russia be enticed 
to 
participate in the commercialization of space? The draft of the 
state program is quiet about that. Oh, these days, hopeful 
assurances are being tossed about to the effect that Russia was, 
is, and will be a great space power. 
  One of those assurances issued from the mouth of Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in his speech at a solemn 
celebration of the Space Program Day. But let's not look at 
words, let's look at realities. Not having yet passed the draft, 
but only having approved it, the government has thereby agreed 
to allocations of more than 16 trillion rubles [R] (at prices of 
the first quarter of 1994) all the way to the year 2000. Some 
R1.7 trillion is expected to be allocated as early as this year. 
That's no small amount, but it's not exorbitant, either -- it's 
0.23 percent of the budgetary outlays (in the United States, the 
percentage is 0.97). The high-tech sector probably deserves the 
better part of that. Especially since, as experience shows, the 
actual monies for it will come in irregularly and in small 
amounts. For example, although the decree specifies that at 
least 30 percent of the monies allocated for the year be 
appropriated every quarter, the RKA in three months has received 
1.9 percent for deliveries of series-produced equipment and 2.9 
percent for cosmodrome maintenance. With such drops in the 
bucket instead of the promised injections, it's impossible to 
guarantee prepayment of the many special orders, and specialists 
feel that within two or three years, our space program will be 
agonizing if... 
<H5>  If Business people Are Not Brought In </H5>
  It's naive, of course, to think that small- and medium-sized 
enterprises are, by themselves, capable of competing with state 
infusions into the space program. But what's to keep them from 
following the West's example and creating funds of risk (or 
venture) capital? That, in particular, was a topic at the Fifth 
Scientific Workshop and Conference "Business People and the 
Economic Development of Space," which took place recently at the 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation. In 
discussing the problems of the commercialization of space, 
scientists and entrepreneurs reached the same conclusion. 
Business people, commercial banks and insurance companies, and 
representatives of regional authorities are fully capable of 
coordinating efforts, creating venture funds, and becoming 
involved in the financing of the commercial projects of the 
space sector. Similar funds in the United States, for example, 
are created as TOO [not further expanded]. For a specific period 
(usually 7-10 years), the accumulate money from the most varied 
of sources: individuals, industrial companies, retirement funds, 
foreign investors, and so forth. Such a consolidation of sources 
is capable of gathering a considerable amount of capital and 
reducing the potential risk for each individual contributor. The 
risk become even less with the cooperation of regional and other 
venture funds (in the United States, they number upwards of 600) 
and the creation of a team of professionals capable of investing 
money in promising, prestigious space projects with a maximum of 
return. Our newspaper has already named a number of them -- 
satellite communications, which is five to six times less 
expensive than cable or radio communications, and space-based 
prospecting of natural resources, which is capable of returning 
R7 for every R1 spent (see DELOVOY MIR, 8 April 1994). 
  At the conference, representatives of the space department 
told of dozens of similar projects. Just one of them involves 
the Bankir system of NPO Sergey Lavochkin, which is capable of 
replacing our extremely archaic, awkward banking transactions 
with paperless technology. There are no such systems abroad yet. 
Bankir will service more than 40,000 subscribers, and all 
finance operations will be effected instantaneously, by ground 
standards. The traffic handling capabilities of the system are 
so great that, in the next three to five years, all Russian 
banks will be able to keep only about 15 percent of it busy. 
Unused channels you could, for sure, sell right and left. 
  God only knows, if I were a wealthy banker, I would break my 
neck on one such project, if only to put together with my 
colleagues a venture fund and use it, and then expand the system 
so that it would envelop the entire globe: if would you be so 
kind, gentlemen Western bankers, as to allow me to be of service 
to you. Alas, at the conference, the voice of the business 
people was timid and muffled. 
<H5>  Where Are You, Entrepreneur-Enthusiasts? </H5>
  Why are the business people being slow about this, why are 
they being so cautious? The question of what is getting in their 
way is not at all rhetorical. The obstacles are manifold. One of 
the main obstacles is that there are no real levers of 
interaction between state and commercial structures in the 
development of space. No legal basis has been drawn up for such 
interaction. There is not yet in Russia a market infrastructure 
capable of flexibly and reliably distributing capital in 
priority sectors and projects. And we've already mentioned above 
of the weakness and lack of coordination of private owners and 
entrepreneurs. 
  The list could go on and on. Everybody knows it well. It is 
the misfortune of our Russian reality that the upper echelons of 
power are deaf to the earthly needs of goods-producers and that 
they don't give them a helping hand. And the entrepreneurs, 
despairing in turn of ever reaching the higher offices with 
their innovations and requests, are up to their ears in humdrum 
concerns and can't see the forest for the trees. 
  Meanwhile, our space wagon can't pull away from the curb to 
get onto the high road without a commercial wheel. And it's not 
a fifth wheel -- it's one of the front wheels. And it needs to 
be put on by the authorities -- who need to set up a clear-cut 
program and a legal basis for the commercialization of space 
research -- and by the business people -- who need to assemble 
the capital and lobby the standard official circles. God 
willing, one or the other will rouse us from our sleep. Anything 
could happen -- even the newcomers could surge ahead of our 
great space power.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Semiryaga: "The Sacramental Question of </F>
Life on Mars Remains Timely. Possibly It Has Gone Underground"] 
  [Text] The situation in world cosmonautics in general and 
for its recognized leaders especially -- Russia and the United 
States -- is developing in such a way that in the very near 
future the planet Mars will be at the center of attention of 
scientists. 
  In 1976 the United States sent to the Red Planet two of its 
Vikings, whose landing modules made a landing on the Martian 
surface at a distance of 6400 km from one another. Mars proved 
to be an exceedingly interesting planet. 
  No traces of life or other biological activity were 
discovered on the Martian surface as a result of the Viking 
experiments, which does not preclude its presence either in 
other places or in depth. 
  The determination of the characteristics, which can be 
determined only by penetrating into the depths of the celestial 
body, makes necessary a changeover to new methods and new 
instruments. One of such promising tools is so-called 
penetrators, which will be used in the "Mars-94" project for 
studying the internal structure of the surface and atmosphere of 
this planet. 
  The penetrator is an object up to 2.5 m in length outfitted 
with systems and devices ensuring its motion after separation 
from an orbital vehicle, introduction into the rock to a depth 
4-6 m, there making scientific determinations and transmitting 
scientific data to the orbital vehicle for its relaying to the 
Earth. 
  That part of it which remains above the surface after 
contact 
with the planet includes: a television camera for panoramic 
imaging of the surface and rock structure and a determination of 
its mineralogical composition, a detector of the meteorological 
complex and a magnetometer. 
  In the cylindrical part, situated directly beneath the 
surface layer of rock, there is a thermosonde detector for 
studying the thermophysical properties of the subsurface ground 
layer, a gamma spectrometer for determining the elemental 
composition of the surface rocks and the electronic units of 
scientific instruments. 
  In the part of the penetrator introduced into the surface 
there is a seismometer, an accelerometer and X-ray, neutron and 
alpha-r spectrometers. 
  The penetrator probes are introduced into the Martian 
atmosphere from a working orbit into which a space station is 
launched. When the probe withdraws from the space station for a 
safe distance solid-propellant engines are fired, which ensures 
its braking and falling in a preselected region. The region for 
the introduction of the penetrator is made with allowance for a 
number of technical limitations: local relief, nature of the 
ground and possibility of ensuring radio communication between 
the penetrator and the space station. 
  After entry into the planetary atmosphere an inflatable 
braking unit is activated which ensures impact of the probe on 
the surface at the necessary speed. Upon impact a 
shock-absorbing system is triggered which guarantees that the 
rated load on the unit will not be exceeded. At the time of 
penetration two parts of the penetrator separate: the introduced 
part, which penetrates to a depth of 4-6 m, and a tail part, 
remaining in the surface ground layer. After landing a 
transmitting antenna is extended with a TV camera and the 
sensors of the scientific instruments. 
  The space vehicle is being constructed by the NPO imeni S. 
A. 
Lavochkin and the scientific instrumentation is being developed 
by the Institute of Geochemistry and Analytic Chemistry imeni V. 
I. Vernadskiy (GEOKHIM) in cooperation with other academic and 
branch institutes of Russia. The "Mars-94" program is a national 
project with international participation: scientific instruments 
also are being supplied by research centers in the United 
States, Great Britain, West Germany, Finland and Bulgaria. 
  The "Mars-94" project is part of a broad-scale program for 
the exploration of Mars which Russia intends to carry out during 
the current decade and consists of two stages. The first 
provides for the launch of an automatic interplanetary station 
which lowers two penetrators onto Mars. In the second stage a 
balloon probe and Martian rover will be delivered to Mars and 
both space stations will become Martian artificial satellites. 
  One of the developers of the penetrators, Professor Yuriy 
Surkov, who heads the planetary research laboratory of GEOKHIM, 
Russian Academy of Sciences, feels that penetrators are an 
example of how the results of fundamental research can be used 
quite rapidly in practical branches. The penetrators can be used 
successfully for studying the environment in inaccessible, 
radioactive, seismically active and other regions which it is 
difficult for man to reach. The probes can be used both as 
navigation beacons and in observing meteorological conditions in 
remote regions. 
  Yuriy Surkov also stated that under the project plans call 
for establishing on Mars an international network of stations 
which will return to the Earth fundamentally new information 
concerning that planet. 
  Scientists see no serious objections to establishing the 
same 
network on the moon. And the idea of dropping penetrators onto 
the asteroids and cometary nuclei for making prolonged (up to 1 
year) observations of them no longer seems completely fantastic. 
Indeed, minor space bodies are the only keepers of information 
on the early period of existence of the solar system. In short, 
the use of penetrators will make it possible to save enormous 
sums in space programs, sharply increasing the quality and 
quantity of the collected scientific information. 
  Science requires a great amount of money, but it can repay 
for itself and then some, which in itself is now a quality 
meriting every kind of respect and support. 
  As SEGODNYA has learned from sources close to the leadership 
of the Russian Space Agency, implementation of the "Mars-94" 
project has been postponed for at least two years. The reason is 
traditional: a shortage of funding. The sum which is proposed be 
allocated is no more than 20% of the real cost of the 
project.

ecological mapping, their volumes, the frequently 
spontaneous-initiative state of affairs advances to the

for this work, as well as the well-known organizing principle.

division, in the regions of falling of rocket parts 1858 tons of 
such pieces have been collected from the tundra. Specialists 
from the Trans-RES Scientific-Production Center assisted the 
rocket specialists. They have special equipment and resources 
for this. The military has neither. Even the rental of a 
helicopter today costs almost a million rubles an hour. The army 
budget does not allow for such expenditures. It is true that 
Trans-RES also has no resources for the delivery of the scrap 
metal to metallurgical plants. It is necessary to lease barges, 
to float them along the Koyda River to Arkhangelsk, where the 
metal is reloaded onto the railroad and shipped to Cherepovets 
or Magnitogorsk. Where to get such money for prepayment? And 
then it is still unknown whether the costs will be recovered. 
Today the prices are rock-bottom. Initially, especially during 
the period of contention for parliamentary and local deputy 
seats, the theme of pollution of the tundra by rocket wastes was 
at the center of attention of all ecological movements and a 
democratically oriented public. There was a demand for the 
immediate clearing of reindeer pastures and rivers from the 
"lethal metal" and enormous fines were imposed on the rocket 
launchers, hailed into court. The soldiers cleared 318 000 
hectares of tundra; how is another question. But there is no 
longer any possibility for clearing the rocket cemeteries. To be 
more exact, there is no money. For two or three months the test 
site has not been receiving its money allowances and the city 
has not been paid for electric power and heat; there is now no 
fear of the court. And the deputies and ecologists also have 
forgotten about them. Possibly for the same reason: however much 
you ask for sweets, no one hands them over. But possibly other 
concerns have appeared, a little more important. Two thousand 
tons of aluminum lie in the Koyda cemetery; they do not rot, 
they do not spoil -- such is the nature of metal. It awaits 
until the country has the money for its evacuation. But the 
tundra? It cannot bear it.

<F P=106> [Article: "Mr. Zatulin Said What He Said, and the NG </F>
Reporter Did Not Distort Anything"] 
  [Text] On 11 May 1994 NG [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] published a 
letter by Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma 
committee on CIS affairs. In it he accuses NG observer Igor 
Rotar of deliberately distorting his words (5 May 1994). The 
letter was written with a fair amount of emotion, and contains 
no specific examples of distortions of direct speech. 
Nonetheless, in our day when the editors have tape recordings of 
the text, we can state that the text published in NG corresponds 
to the original almost perfectly. Mr. Zatulin himself can 
confirm this by dropping in at the editorial offices. 
  We will also present refutations of those of Mr. Zatulin's 
accusations which, stretching the point, could be called 
concrete. 
  1. "I categorically object to the fact that I. Rotar, who 
acted as guide and interpreter for his Japanese guest at the 
meeting one and one-half months ago, has gathered intelligence 
at my expense, juggling a text that I have never seen." 
  At the start of the conversation Igor Rotar introduced 
himself to Mr. Zatulin as an NG reporter. The chairman of the 
Duma committee also "forgot" that most of the questions were 
asked by the NG reporter, not the Japanese political scientist. 
  The conversation took place in Russian; during the 90 minute 
interview not a single word was spoken in English or Japanese. 
  2. "It might also be noted that the word satellite in modern 
Russian philology has a deprecatory meaning, which the word ally 
does not at all, and the author of the work should certainly be 
aware of this." 
  Here is Mr. Zatulin's exact text: "By this I mean to say, 
with all respect to the current status of these states (the CIS 
countries--NG), many of them, they are doomed either to a very 
close alliance, to the role of satellite, or to extinction." 
  Zatulin: "I leave on his (I. Rotar's) conscience my 
'revelations' of the type: 'A little country should be happy 
when it is in the sphere of influence of a large state,' and 
also the abundance of military field terminology ('conquer,' 
'die,' and so on)." 
  The word "conquer" is found one time in Mr. Zatulin's 
interview in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. Zatulin's exact words are: 
"Abkhazia cannot conquer Georgia without someone's support." The 
word "die" also occurs one time, in the chairman of the Duma 
committee's above-cited passage about satellite states. 
  It is true that the phrase, "A little country should be 
happy 
when it is in the sphere of influence of a large state," does 
not occur in that exact wording. But Zatulin did say something 
very close to it in meaning. The exact text is: "I am a 
supporter of empire, if we speak of empire and understand this 
to mean imperial peace...a way of keeping the peace...Their 
coexistence side by side with an empire allows them (the CIS 
republics and republics within Russia) to guarantee somehow, for 
one, the advantages of such coexistence--which means economic 
ties, and for two, enables them to place the concerns of general 
security and defense on the stronger state. As it was for a long 
time in relation to Japan and Western Europe; the United States 
assumed the obligations of defending what they called the free 
world...Because Japan did not spend money on arms the economic 
miracle became possible...ultimately to appear as an economic 
superpower." 
  Yutaka Akino, advisor to the Japanese Government 
(Department of Politics and International Relations) on 
questions of the CIS, and political scientist at Tsukuba 
University, Japan: "About a week ago my Moscow friend, the 
journalist Igor Rotar, telephoned me at home. From my talk with 
Igor I learned that Mr. Zatulin is accusing him of libel, saying 
that the journalist distorted his words terribly in his article 
in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. I was extremely surprised, not least 
because I was with Igor during the conversation with the 
chairman of the State Duma committee on CIS affairs and ties 
with countrymen, but also because we worked together on the text 
of the interview, taking care not to permit any distortion in 
the words of our highly-placed interviewee. 
  "During my trips around the former Soviet Union I was 
already 
accustomed to encountering things that seemed strange and 
unusual to me, a Japanese man. But what happened seems amazing 
to me even in the Russian context: a well-known politician very 
enthusiastically shares his quite unexpected views, then a month 
later has already completely forgotten them. 
  "Incidentally, the interview with Zatulin that I published 
in 
late March in the Japanese magazine SEKAI SHUHO caused a 
sensation among our political scientists: if the Russian 
centrists hold such views, what is there to say about the 
rightists! But the latest unexpected action by Zatulin will 
perhaps surprise my countrymen even more than the originality of 
his political credo."

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Rotar, under the rubric "Opinion": "Russian </F>
Neoimperialism--Are the Capital Democrats Planning a `Dash to 
the South'?"] 
  [Text] The position of official Moscow concerning policy in 
the near abroad changed sharply almost immediately after the 
October events of last year. What before had been done secretly 
is now announced openly. Thus, in the new Russian military 
doctrine the near abroad is declared a zone of vital interests 
of the former mother country. 
  The change in theoretical declarations goes along with 
practical successes. The entry of Georgia into the CIS and its 
consent to the stationing of Russian troops in its territory 
seems like just the first symptom of Moscow's triumphant march 
into the near abroad. Thus, in the opinion of Abdudzhalil 
Samadov, prime minister of Tajikistan, at the completion of the 
term of the presence of Russian troops in his country (December 
1994) they will most likely form the basis for creation of a 
Russian military base, and a similar agreement is supposed to be 
reached with Armenia in the near future. 
  As our NG [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] reporter was told in circles 
close to the leadership of the Dniester Republic, in talks with 
Chisinau Moscow is insisting on conversion of the 14th Russian 
Army, which is stationed in this region, into a military base of 
the former mother country. Aleksandr Lebed, commanding officer 
of the 14th Army and an implacable foe of Tiraspol, agrees with 
this point of view: "It is not necessary to resort to blatant 
force to convince Chisinau of the need to form a Russian 
military base on the basis of our army; economic sanctions are 
enough." 
  The views of Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the RF State 
Duma committee on CIS affairs and ties with countrymen and 
member of the "Shakhrai party" PRES [Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord], are much more radical. 
  It is instructive that Zatulin, as a member of Shakhrai's 
party, belongs more to the democratic camp than to the 
national-patriotic bloc. PRES today, with two representatives 
who are vice premiers, occupies key positions in the Russian 
Government. 
  These views are also quite close to the RF MID [Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs]. Thus, in conversation with an NG reporter 
Vadim Kuznetsov, director of the MID Department of CIS Affairs, 
said that the goals of the corresponding Duma committee and his 
department are identical and they are developing constructive 
relations with Zatulin. It is another matter that the RF MID is 
sometimes accused of being too soft. For example, in Zatulin's 
opinion, Russia should use economic levers to defend the 
Russian-speaking population in the near abroad. Although 
Kuznetsov generally agrees with this position, he thinks the 
Russia should also show flexibility. 
  The department director said that Russia has its own vital 
interests, and naturally they are above all in the countries of 
the near abroad. The main task of Russian diplomacy in the near 
abroad is defense of the Russian-speaking population. "We are 
now saying directly that we will defend our interests on the 
basis of the precepts of international law," the Russian 
diplomat stressed. 
  The position of the RF MID in relation to the separatist 
regions (the Dniester Republic, Abkhazia, and Nagornyy Karabakh) 
is analogous. In Kuznetsov's opinion, Russia is guided in these 
regions by two fundamental and equally weighted principles: 
"Preservation of the territorial integrity of the corresponding 
states and granting of broad rights to ethnic formations within 
the framework of these states on the basis of a formula that 
should be worked out by political means." 
  It is true that, unlike the chairman of the Duma committee, 
the Russian diplomats uphold this formula only in the 
above-mentioned conflict regions: "Application of this principle 
in other territories is plainly going too far and could provoke 
new conflicts." 
  It is instructive that the Russian radical democrats too 
agree with the idea of restoring something like the Russian 
empire. In the opinion of Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the 
Council of the Federation, the CIS has demonstrated its 
ineffectiveness. As the chairman of the upper house of the 
Russian Parliament believes, it would be wise to establish a 
closer union of several states of the former Soviet Union to 
which the other countries of the near abroad would be joined 
after a time. 
  Although there are many differences among the positions of 
the Russian political parties in relation to the near abroad, 
they are still fundamentally similar because they proclaim the 
near abroad to be a zone of vital Russian interests and view 
Moscow as the natural, realistic defender of ethnic minorities 
in the new independent states. The "softness" of the positions 
of official Moscow can hardly create any illusions--the 
imperialist views of the moderates were also preceded by a 
period of anticolonial declarations, but an analysis of the 
metamorphosis of Russian policy in the near abroad allows us to 
assume that a sharp turn to the right is just a matter of time. 
  It appears that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is right (IZVESTIYA, 
27 
April 1994): "Two and one-half years ago I ran in the 
presidential elections with the slogan, 'I will defend Russians 
and small peoples.' I was called a chauvinist then. But now even 
Kozyrev is defending (in words for now) the Russians in the 
Baltic region. Where are the democratic Russians with their 
universal human values now? Where is the Russian democratic 
appeal to the regions, 'Take as much sovereignty as you can 
carry'? It is unseemly even to recall that." 
  So it is not impossible that the idea of a "final dash to 
the 
south" may become the foundation of state policy, even if the 
national patriots are unable to achieve the fall of the present 
regime.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Mikhnevich, DELOVOY MIR: "Stock Market: </F>
Fighting Under a Patchwork Quilt"] 
  [Text] The securities market will have nothing in 
common with investments until the State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property, the Ministry of Finance, and 
the Central Bank stop pulling it apart, fighting for spheres of 
influence. This was discussed at the hearings of problems of the 
stock market organized by the Commission on Securities and Stock 
Exchanges. Representatives of the capital's and regional stock 
exchanges, investment companies, and broker firms, who were 
invited to the hearings, accused the commission of a lack of 
professionalism, demanded the inclusion of their representatives 
in its membership, and nicknamed what was happening around the 
stock market fighting under a patchwork quilt. The Union of 
Stock Exchanges spoke out even more sharply at the press 
conference, which it held immediately upon the conclusion of the 
hearings. 
<H5>  Welcome to the Shadow Economy </H5>
  The Union of Stock Exchanges sent an appeal to the Russian 
Federation President, in which it warned him about the 
consequences of the actions of the State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property, the Ministry of Finance, and 
the Central Bank, which were pushing the securities market into 
the criminal sphere. The appeal stressed that the situation on 
the stock market was approaching the critical level and was 
developing toward the emergence of a new wave of scandals and 
exposures, which would definitively undermine the population's 
and investors' confidence in privatization and in the securities 
market. 
  The paradox lies in the fact that representatives of 
precisely these three departments form the nucleus of the 
Commission on Securities and Stock Exchanges under the Russian 
Federation President. In the absence of legislation presidential 
edicts must regulate the process of privatization and the 
mechanism of the securities market. One can only guess what 
information the president receives from the commission. However, 
as Yuriy Milyukov (the Moscow Commodity Exchange) and Igor 
Suvorov (the Russian Stock Exchange), presidents of the 
capital's two exchanges, and Aleksandr Deryabin, director of the 
International Stock Market Institute, stated, the commission 
works inefficiently, unprofessionally, and in a disinterested 
manner and represents only the interests of its constituent 
departments. It deliberately ignores the experience and 
intellectual potential of practical stock exchange experts and, 
counter to the president's decision, does everything to remove 
them from participation in the preparation of draft laws and the 
elaboration of recommendations for market regulation. 
  Incidentally, participants in the hearings, who were not 
sparing of epithets directed against the commission, also fully 
shared this point of view. The essence of their statements 
boiled down to the fact that market regulation occurred 
according to the principle "to rule and not let go!", whereas 
the situation on the stock market and the course of 
privatization required the adoption of thought-out and balanced 
decisions, especially during the period of absence of 
legislative acts. 
  In this situation it is significant that at the state level 
no one is responsible for the securities market. The commission 
operates not on a permanent, but, in fact, on a voluntary, 
basis. Nevertheless, collective irresponsibility does not rule 
out at all the adoption by the Ministry of Finance and the State 
Committee on the Administration of State Property of decisions, 
which, according to Igor Suvorov, push the securities market 
into crime. The scheme is as follows: At first the shifting of 
operations with securities from the exchange sector to the 
nonexchange sector, then transition to cash transactions, and, 
finally, departure for the shadow economy. If we are guided by 
statistics, Suvorov is right: The nonexchange turnover on the 
securities market already exceeds greatly the exchange turnover 
and, according to forecasts, this is a steady trend. 
  Another trend--the increase in the confrontation between 
stock exchanges and the State Committee on the Administration of 
State Property, the Ministry of Finance, and the Central 
Bank--can also be called steady. There are ample complaints. The 
Ministry of Finance is accused of appropriating the right to 
decide individually what is and is not a security; the State 
Committee on the Administration of State Property, of the 
attempt to divert the stock market to the nonexchange turnover 
and to deprive it of transparency, that is, openness and 
reliable information; of attempts to place the stock market 
under control through the establishment of so-called 
self-regulating organizations operating under the control of the 
State Committee on the Administration of State Property. As 
affirmed, this is done only in the interest of officials, who 
are threatened with unemployment upon the conclusion of voucher 
privatization. 
  On their part representatives of the mentioned state 
structures and of the Central Bank maintain that strict control 
by them hinders unscrupulous issuers, investors, and middlemen. 
A totally absurd situation arises, when opposing sides, guided, 
according to them, by totally good intentions, are forced to 
observe how criminal structures ever more actively interfere in 
the process of privatization and gradually become established on 
the securities market. 
<H5>  A Fight Where There Will Be No Winners </H5>
  Ultimately, the solution of the problem concerning the 
further fate of the securities market depends on the choice of 
what path to follow: To give preference to strict state 
regulation, or to rely on natural objective processes operating 
in the market economy. 
  State management bodies rely on the former, and the Union of 
Stock Exchanges on the latter. In theory, compromise options are 
also possible. However, state structures, frightened by 
privatization, which is getting out of control, a fact recently 
acknowledged by Anatoliy Chubays, will hardly go for this. In 
addition to the introduction of order, which lies within the 
range of official duties, they will have to save their own 
reputation, because today the mechanism of privatization is 
subjected to criticism from right and left. 
  However, no matter how clumsy privatization may seem, the 
interests of the parties concerned have already become clear. 
Privatized enterprises need money. Most of them not only do not 
have assets for production development, but, in general, are 
without circulating capital. They can get them either from the 
state budget, or from bank credits, or through a free sale on 
the securities market. If we take into account that the state 
treasury is empty, while the rates of interest on credit are 
high, emission is the only real way of attracting capital. 
Moreover, as experts believe, the establishment of a highly 
liquid stock market is the most efficient, as well as cheaper, 
method of activating investments. 
  The Union of Stock Exchanges has already examined this 
matter 
repeatedly. What should be done? First, it is possible to more 
rapidly adopt a series of legislative acts regulating the rights 
and duties of investors and issuers, as well as stockholders. 
The system of guarantees for the return of investments should 
also be formalized legislatively, without which no one will 
begin to invest money in production. 
  Then it is necessary to regulate the system of mutual 
settlements in order to ensure conditions for the transfer of 
capital. Today this is impossible, because, as Suvorov cleverly 
noted, the Central Bank established concentration camps for 
money, where it loses value owing to inflation. 
  It is also necessary to determine our position on the 
technological base--depositaries and the recording of the 
movement of shares. At any moment the issuer must know how much 
he owes and to whom. This also includes the establishment of an 
efficient information space, which makes it possible not only to 
judge what is sold and where, but also to obtain exhausting 
information on issuers. It should be easily available to 
all--both private stockholders and big investors. Then a barrier 
will be placed against false advertising. 
  It is necessary to train personnel, because in most cases 
the 
skills of middlemen operating on the stock market leave much to 
be desired. In general, it is not important who will issue 
licenses. It is only important that this be done according to a 
single form and within a strict framework of uniform demands on 
middlemen. 
  Finally, it is necessary to establish in the law guarantees 
for owners' rights and mechanisms for the resolution of 
conflicts. 
  Yuriy Milyukov, Igor Suvorov, and Aleksandr Deryabin believe 
that in many respects the crisis on the stock market has been 
created artificially. The reason: The fight for spheres of 
influence among officials, a fight, in which there will be 
everything except winners. 
<H5>  Who Should Prepare the Package of Laws? </H5>
  As it turns out, today this is the question of questions. If 
we proceed from the rules of procedure, the Commission on 
Securities and Stock Exchanges should submit projects for 
hearings to the State Duma. However, subjects of the market do 
not trust the commission. The satisfaction of their demand to 
include their representatives in the commission's membership 
seems very doubtful and does not frighten officials especially. 
As one of the presidium members remarked in passing, if you 
insist, submit a list. The staff will examine it in accordance 
with the established procedure, after which it will be submitted 
to the president for approval. 
  One can say right away what will come out of this: While the 
paper circulates among the authorities, no time will be left to 
work out proposals. What will the State Duma adopt? 
  For now the audience's attention has been called to three 
versions of laws. Two of them--the Law on the Securities Market 
and the Law on Investment Securities--were drafted in the 
Administration of Securities of the Central Bank. Two others--On 
Securities and Stock Exchanges and On Investment Securities and 
Stock Exchanges--were drafted by groups of independent experts. 
However, having received texts 1/2 hour before the beginning of 
the meeting, participants did not begin to spend time on 
studying them, having decided to give this to experts and to 
hear at the next meeting, where the commission would have to 
deal not with representatives of uncoordinated broker firms, but 
with especially delegated professionals. 
  Possibly, proposals will also follow from the State 
Committee 
on the Administration of State Property, which immediately after 
the hearings promulgated its concept of postvoucher 
privatization. For now it does not say a word about the 
securities market. 
  Thus, the countdown has begun and, as Anatoliy Chubays 
sensibly noted, it works against us. 
  Experts assume that, if the opposing sides do not manage to 
attain a balance of interests, the stock market in Russia may 
not exist. That is, securities, of course, will circulate on it, 
but enterprises in need of an inflow of investments will not 
receive even a penny from this. 
<H5>  Alas, the Fate of Stockholders Is Not in Their Hands </H5>
  Although today two out of three Russians are stockholders, 
no 
one can really say what they will have from this. Most of them 
are in the position of Pinocchio in the Land of the Fools. 
Having been burned by voucher privatization, it is unlikely that 
they will begin to chase after the shares of newly appeared 
issuers. This seriously worries the founders of privatization, 
because everyone knows that the population has money available. 
  Today one can say with good reason that the investment 
crisis 
is based on the confidence crisis. On the other hand, it is 
already clear that the reforming of securities is meaningless 
without the reforming of other fields; for example, of the 
banking and tax system. The opposition quite justly reproaches 
the government for the lack of an integrated approach to 
reforms. One has to believe Aleksandr Livshits, director of the 
group of experts under the president, who declared at the 
hearings that he would like to find in the corridors of power at 
least one person seriously concerned about this problem. 
  Stock market experts are almost unanimous in the opinion 
that 
without the consolidation of efforts in all directions it will 
not be possible to create an effective mechanism of circulation 
of securities. If so, just as we do not see our ears, we will 
not see a civilized stock market operating in the interest of 
issuers, middlemen, and stockholders. The circulation of capital 
will continue, but it will only unleash inflation. Money will 
make money, but production will lose its priority. 
  Possibly, by the next hearings, which are to be held in 3 
months, the commission's membership will be renewed. Then two 
scenarios are possible: Either at least outlines of an accord 
with the interests of the subjects of the market will emerge, or 
the fighting arena will move to the commission. 
  And, finally, the last. Possibly, organizers of the hearings 
were sorry that they invited the press to them. Journalists did 
not have to chase after an interview. Participants went to the 
press center on their own in order to share urgent problems; 
especially representatives of regions, who complained about the 
unprofessionalism of regional administrations of the Ministry of 
Finance, arbitrariness of local authorities, confusion with the 
normative base, lack of information from Moscow, excessive 
taxes, corruption, and invasion of organized crime into the 
process of privatization. Answering my question concerning 
promises by Anatoliy Chubays and Dmitriy Vasilyev, the 
representative of a Rostov broker firm answered as follows: 
"This is like a dream! I am walking and squinting my eyes..."

<F P=106> [Article from FINNANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA section by Igor Krylov, </F>
professor at the Independent Institute of Russian 
Entrepreneurship: "The Advertising Law Should Protect the 
Consumer"] 
  [Text] Recently the board of the Antimonopoly Committee 
considered and approved the second version of the draft Law "On 
Advertising." This 20-page text, which is fairly difficult to 
understand and analyze, was sent at the same time to the 
government and State Duma committees for remarks. In the opinion 
of the chairman of the Duma Committee on Economic Reform, Sergey 
Glazyev, the Law "On Advertising" should be a priority in the 
plans for legislative work. 
  Legal regulation of the advertising market is a mandatory 
condition for its civilized development and protection of the 
consumer from unconscientious, not to mention false, 
advertising. In the United States, for example, the first 
judicial proceedings on unconscientious advertising were 
initiated in a case of the Federal Trade Commission (this state 
organization was especially created to combat monopolies and 
unfair competition as early as 1919). 
  In the absence of domestic experience and the corresponding 
legal experts, we could make a big mess of the draft law. 
  Actually, this occurred with the first version of the draft 
law (it was called "On Advertising and Advertising-Information 
Activity") prepared in November of last year by a work group 
consisting of workers of the Antimonopoly Committee. The 
isolated nature of the work on the document led to a number of 
legal errors and simply absurdities. A considerable portion of 
the draft amounted to assigning the Antimonopoly Committee an 
exceptional number of rights, including to impose fines. 
  In essence, the draft (the first and second versions do not 
differ from one another here) introduces the position of a kind 
of "state advertising inspector" who has the right to give 
orders and impose fines for failure to fulfill them on 
advertisers, advertising agencies, and the mass media. And these 
fines are quite significant. In the second version of the draft 
the Antimonopoly Committee and its territorial organs may impose 
fines of up to 5,000 times the minimum wage (that is, as of 
today, up to 75 million rubles [R]) on a legal entity, and up to 
five times the salary on an individual. Let me note that for 
violation of the Law "On Competition and Restriction of 
Monopolistic Activity on Commodity Markets" of 22 March 1991 the 
fines possibly imposed by the Antimonopoly Committee are set in 
absolute figures and are much more modest (up to R1 million--the 
fine imposed on a legal entity; up to R2,000--on officials). 
  Incidentally, the possibility of applying these punitive 
sanctions against unconscientious advertisers was first granted 
to the State Committee on Antimonopoy Policy and its territorial 
administrations two years ago. It is well known that Article 10 
of the Law "On Competition and Restriction of Monopolistic 
Activity on Commodity Markets" includes in unfair competition 
deliberately false advertising, incorrect comparisons in 
advertising, unauthorized use of another's trademark or firm 
name, divulgence and use of trade secrets without the owner's 
permission... 
  Nonetheless in two years the State Committee on Antimonopoly 
Policy and its territorial organs have not once taken advantage 
of these legal possibilities, and committee specialists in 
commentaries to antimonopoly legislation recommend combating 
unconscientious competition by filing charges with a general or 
arbitration court. What is keeping the Antimonopoly Committee, 
instead of signing letters to television authorities on the 
unconscientious advertising of MMM-Invest, from fining the 
"leader of Russian business" at least a token million rubles for 
the lie about the official approval of their "merits" by the 
King of Belgium and the European Economic Community? Why is it 
that while doing nothing to apply the rights they have in 
fighting against advertising piracy, committee specialists are 
demanding considerably greater ones? 
  The real danger from introducing the post of "state 
advertising inspector" could be very, very great. On the one 
hand, as distinct, for example, from the tax inspector, the fire 
monitor, or the sanitary-epidemiological supervisor, the draft 
law does not provide him with any clear-cut criteria to use in 
his work. In complete contradiction to world practice, Point 2 
of Article 23 of the draft establishes that "...in order to deem 
advertising unconscientious it is not necessary to show a fact 
of deception or a public danger of it. When there is a potential 
possibility as such, which must be proved by the organ of state 
administration (that is, the Antimonopoly 
Committee)...advertising may be categorized as unconscientious." 
In American judicial practice, for example, they clearly 
understood the falseness of this path even by 1931 (in the 
decision on the case "FTC v. Raladam," the U.S. Supreme Court 
developed a precedent according to which advertising may be 
deemed false or deceptive only if there is evidence of direct 
harm from it). 
  On the other hand, anybody who is at all familiar with the 
ways of doing business here will easily understand what a 
desirable target for bribery the "state advertising inspector" 
will be. It will be possible not only to completely ruin the 
competitor but also line the pockets of one's own advertising 
agency or advertising department of the mass media through 
placement of counter-advertising, as it says in Point 4 of 
Article 25 of the draft, "through the same means of 
communication, using the same specifications of length, space, 
location, and order of presentation of advertising." Reading 
this, it is painful to recall our advertising realities: The 
rate for the smallest advertising space--1/64, for example in 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has already exceeded R2 million; and in 
order to begin any negotiations on advertising on central 
television you should be able to come up with at least 10 
million. 
  The Antimonopoly Committee is extremely timid and unwilling 
to share its rights with any professional association in this 
sphere. In Point 2 of Article 30 organs of "self-regulation of 
advertising activity" are given the right only to participate in 
overseeing the observance of legislation on unconscientious 
advertising "in conjunction with the corresponding organs of 
state administration." Yet, for example, in France it is the 
professional association of advertisers and representatives of 
the mass media that annually issue to the agencies the so-called 
accreditation card. Only possession of this card gives them the 
right to the traditional 15-percent rebate from advertising 
rates of the mass media. Such a practice of economic incentives 
for the advertising agency to observe legal and 
professional-ethnical norms would be more than appropriate for 
us. 
  The clearly inadequate development of the draft in the 
professional environment is also indicated by such strange 
requirements as establishing the maximum volume of advertising 
in a newspaper no later than three months before the end of the 
subscription campaign or the need to store advertising materials 
for a year. Experience shows that the editors have extremely 
little chance of influencing the volume of the advertising flow; 
just as it shows that in practice there are no original-mockups 
of advertising in a form suitable for long-term storage, 
permanent changes made in a text by fax, telephone, etc. 
  Fundamentally important norms in the draft are in need of 
concretization--the peculiarities of financial advertising 
(Point 6 of Article 18) and the prohibition of indirect 
advertising (Point 2 of Article 16). 
  The Law "On Advertising" is among the normative documents 
which, on the one hand, are most important for forming a 
civilized market economy in Russia and, on the other, affect the 
interests of the majority of Russians who during the past three 
years have been forced, whether they liked it or not, to be 
active "consumers of advertising." The main thing here is to 
find the optimal combination of state intervention and 
professional public self-regulation which, in my view, the 
developers have not yet managed to do. It is not too late to 
rectify the situation--it necessary to publish the draft law for 
professional discussion and listen attentively to constructive 
criticism of it.

<F P=106> [Article by Finnish News Service correspondent in Goteborg: </F>
"Volvo Factory for Vyborg?"] 
  [Text] The Swedish carmaker Volvo may be forced to start 
assembling automobiles in Russia. Though this has been under 
examination by the company, high import duties have given the 
issue new impetus. 
  A possible location is the harbor of Vysotsk in Vyborg; 
another is St. Petersburg, where cutbacks in the military 
industry have left many vacant facilities. 
  "We are looking at many conceivable locations for an 
assembly 
plant in Russia, but no decision has been made on production," 
says Olle Odsell, public relations chief of Volvo Cars 
International. 
  What has spurred Volvo's interest in assembling cars in 
Russia are the high import duties and other taxes that that 
country has recently imposed on imported cars. 
  "Import duties and other fees now total 146 percent of the 
invoiced price of the car," says Odsell. "In this situation it 
will be interesting to see if it would be possible to avoid at 
least some of these by putting cars together in Russia." 
  Volvo's decision is dependent on how tax and import 
regulations are going to look in Russia over the foreseeable 
future. Rumors are circulating that they are going to be lowered 
again. 
  "Only if the import duties stay at the present high level 
will it be profitable for Volvo to establish itself there," says 
Odsell. "It is more expensive to assemble them in Goteborg. 
Shipping and assembling are associated costs, plus the 
investments that would have to be made." 
<H5>  Many Aspects </H5>
  Volvo must also take other aspects into account. There are 
no 
plants in Vyborg, so everything would have to be constructed 
from the ground up. In St. Petersburg, already a year ago, Mayor 
Sobchak offered to let Volvo start production in the city's 
military plants. Labor force availability is also an important 
consideration. 
  The car model being looked at is the 940 series, and a 
diagram on capacity was presented in the [business] daily DAGENS 
INDUSTRI some time ago suggesting 10,000 units annually. 
  Volvo equipped and trained 28 authorized dealers last year 
in 
Russia, and they sold around 7,000 cars. The high import duties, 
which have more than doubled the price for a new Volvo since the 
beginning of this year, have meant that many dealers are having 
big problems in selling any cars at all. 
  Pekka Perttiniemi, chief of Volvo Cars International in 
Russia, said to DAGENS INDUSTRI: "For logical reasons we will 
locate near the border with Finland, and therefore the harbor 
Vysotsk is a better alternative. Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak wanted 
to attract us there a year ago. At that time we had no plans for 
starting up assembly operations, since we could import cars and 
sell them. St. Petersburg is still one of the alternatives we 
are studying," said Perttiniemi.

<F P=106> ["Directive No. 44-r of 10 January 1994: On Procedure for </F>
Coordinating the Reorganization of Check Investment Funds"] 
  [Text] On 10 January 1994 the State Committee on 
Administration of State Property of Russia issued Directive No. 
44-r "On Procedure for Coordinating the Reorganization of Check 
Investment Funds." This directive established the procedure for 
merging and consolidating check investment funds which should be 
implemented in coordination with the State Committee on 
Administration of State Property of Russia or with the 
corresponding committee on administration of state property 
which has issued the license to the fund. 
  This directive practically removes the problem of bankrupt 
funds which for one reason or another are unable to continue 
their activity in the future but have obligations to their 
shareholders who have entrusted them with their privatization 
checks. In practice this directive implements the procedure for 
coordination of any reorganization of check investment funds 
with the State Committee on Administration of State Property of 
Russia or its territorial agency regarding questions of deciding 
the future fate of the fund and its shareholders, thus 
protecting their rights as stipulated by law. 
  The text of this directive is given below. 
<H5>  Directive No. 44-r of 10 January 1994: On Procedure for </H5>
Coordinating the Reorganization of Check Investment Funds 
  In compliance with point 45 of the Statute on Specialized 
Privatization Investment Funds Accumulating Privatization Checks 
of Citizens, approved by Edict No. 1186 of the President of the 
Russian Federation of 7 October 1992, the following procedure 
shall be established for reorganizing check investment funds: 
  1. The reorganization of the check investment fund 
(hereinafter--fund) during the first three years of its activity 
may be effected only through merging or consolidation in 
coordination with the State Committee on Administration of State 
Property of Russia or the corresponding committee for 
administration of property that issued its license. Moreover, 
all funds participating in the consolidation or merger shall be 
reorganized. 
  2. The reorganization of the fund shall entail a transfer of 
the rights and responsibilities of the fund to its successor. 
  3. Reorganization in the form of merger shall be effected 
through merger of the assets of one fund and the assets of the 
other with an equivalent exchange of shares and merger of the 
balance sheets. Reorganization in the form of consolidation 
shall be a unification of the controlling blocks of shares of 
the funds and transfer of the property rights and 
responsibilities of each of them to the fund that appears as a 
result of the consolidation. 
  4. In order for the question of the reorganization of a 
check 
investment fund to be considered, the applicant must submit to 
the State Committee on Administration of State Property of 
Russia or the corresponding committee for management of property 
the following documents: 
  --an application with an indication of the justification and 
conditions for the reorganization signed by the chairman of the 
council of directors; 
  --the license issued to the fund by the State Committee on 
Administration of State Property of Russia or the Committee on 
Administration of State Property; 
  --the resolution of the general meeting of shareholders 
concerning reorganization of the fund adopted by a simple 
majority of votes of those present at the meeting of 
shareholders with a quorum; 
  --the original founding documents of the reorganized fund; 
  --properly prepared copies of agreements with the manager 
and 
the depository of the reorganized fund; 
  --a financial report of the reorganized fund as of the 
moment 
of the submission of the application on a form approved by the 
Statute on Specialized Privatization Investment Forms 
Accumulating Privatization Checks of Citizens, and verified by 
an independent auditor. 
  The aforementioned documents shall be submitted by the funds 
participating in the consolidation or merger. If funds are 
consolidated, the existing licenses of various committees on 
administration of state property and an application from them 
shall be submitted to the State Committee on Administration of 
State Property of Russia. 
  In the event the documents or applications are not submitted 
at the same time or if even one of the aforementioned 
participants submits documents in violation of the requirements 
enumerated above, the applications of all the funds 
participating in the reorganization shall be returned without 
being considered. 
  5. The State Committee on Administration of State Property 
of 
Russia or the committee on administration of property shall be 
obligated to consider the application and make a decision on 
acceptance or rejection of the reorganization of the fund no 
later than 25 days from the day the application is submitted. In 
exceptional cases this time period may be extended by a decision 
of the State Committee on Administration of State Property of 
Russia or the committee on administration of property that 
considers the application. 
  When handing down the aforementioned decision the committee 
shall conduct an inspection for: 
  a) observance of the rights and legitimate interests of the 
shareholders of the reorganized funds, taking into account the 
restrictions envisioned in point 4 of the Statute on Specialized 
Investment Privatization Funds; 
  b) possible concealment by the funds of the result of their 
reorganization of their bankruptcy or credit indebtedness. 
  In the event of the discovery of such cases the committee on 
administration of property shall have the right to refuse to 
allow the fund to reorganize. 
  6. The consent for reorganization of the fund shall be 
documented by a directive of the State Committee on 
Administration of State Property of Russia or the corresponding 
committee on administration of property, which shall reflect the 
following issues: 
  --the annulment of the license and the public prospectus for 
emission of the consolidated or merged funds; 
  --merger of the assets and balance sheets of the fund with 
the corresponding instruction to the reorganized fund; 
  --time periods and procedure for exchange of shares of the 
consolidated or merged funds; 
  --the corresponding changes and additions to the founding 
documents and also, if necessary, to the prospectus for emission 
of the reorganized fund; 
  --forwarding of the original founding documents of the fund 
with changes and additions to organs that conduct state 
registration. 
  7. Upon receipt of permission to reorganize, the fund must 
within 10 days: 
  a) submit to state registration organs the corresponding 
application for making changes and additions to the founding 
documents and a copy of the directive on its reorganization; 
  b) notify shareholders in writing of its merger or 
consolidation and publish the corresponding notification of this 
in the open press. 
  The notification and public notice of the reorganization 
must 
indicate the location of the successor of the fund and the form 
(means) of exchange of shares or certificates of the reorganized 
fund for shares or certificates of its legal successor. 
  8. The committee on administration of state property must, 
within three days after the publication of the directive 
specified in point 6, send to the Main Administration on 
Invested Funds of the State Committee on Administration of State 
Property of Russia the following information in order to make 
changes in the consolidated register of investment funds: 
  --the name of the consolidated fund; 
  --the number and date of the cancellation of the license; 
  --the form or reorganization; 
  --information about the fund to which it has been joined; 
  --a copy of the directive. 
  In the event of a consolidation, information is provided on 
all consolidated funds and the newly created fund resulting from 
this consolidation. 
  9. The fund shall be considered reorganized from the moment 
it is removed from the state register. 
  [Signed] First Deputy Chairman A.I. Ivanenko

  [Signed] Deputy Chairman D.V. Vasilyev 
<H5>  On the Results of the All-Russian Conference "Problems of </H5>
Completion of Check Privatization and Development of the Stock 
Market" 
  From 29 March through 1 April 1994 in Izhevsk there was an 
all-Russian conference of check investment funds called 
"Problems of Completion of Check Privatization and Development 
of the Stock Market." The purpose of the conference was to 
resolve the following problems: 
  1. Completion of check privatization and solving problems of 
check investment funds and the development of the stock market 
in the regions. 
  2. Consideration of problems of forming the state investment 
program under conditions of the emerging capital market. 
  3. Discussion of problems of the development of the 
infrastructure for the stock market. 
  4. Consideration of the prospects for privatization of 
defense industry enterprises. 
  Participating in the conference were more than 100 
representatives of various regional check investment funds and 
representatives of the State Committee on Administration of 
State Property of Russia, the Ministry of Finance of Russia, the 
Federal Property Fund of Russia, and the Ministry of Economics 
which, as a result of the discussion, adopted recommendations 
for further regulation of the activity of check investment funds 
after the expiration of the validity of the privatization check 
and further establishment of this institutional investor on the 
Russian stock market. 
<H5>  Recommendations of the All-Russian Conference "Problems of </H5>
Completion of Check Privatization and Development of the Stock 
Market" (Izhvesk 29 March-1 April 1994) 
  Participants in the all-Russian conference think that the 
check privatization that was conducted contributed to the 
creation of a foundation for a national stock market. At the 
present time more than 600 check investment funds are 
functioning, making up an institutional basis for the market for 
shares of privatized enterprises. A network of depositories in 
all regions of the country has been formed. 
  The conference thinks that effective development of the 
securities market is possible only through consolidation of the 
efforts of all of its participants and also organs of state 
power and administration, and it recommends: 
  1. The Commission on Securities and the Stock Market in 
conjunction with the Ministry of Finance of Russia, the State 
Committee on Administration of State Property of Russia, the 
Ministry of Economics of Russia, and the Russian Federal 
Property Fund should analyze the socioeconomic consequences of 
check privatization and develop proposals for conducting 
monetary privatization. 
  2. The Federal Assembly of Russia should consider as a 
priority the legislative acts on regulation of the securities 
market in the activity of joint-stock companies, which should 
envision a procedure for issuing demand securities and 
protection of the rights of all stockholders in questions of 
paying dividends. 
  3. The State Committee on Administration of State Property 
and the Ministry of Finance of Russia should consider the 
question of reducing by 50 percent the profit tax on check 
investment funds when selling shares in privatized enterprises. 
  4. The State Committee on Administration of State Property 
of 
Russia should make changes in the normative documents regulating 
the activity of check investment funds, particularly: 
  --remove bans and restrictions on investments in securities 
of a single issuer, promissory notes, term contracts, and real 
estate; 
  --permit the purchase of one's own shares; 
  --bring the standard regulations of the public joint-stock 
company approved by Edict No. 721 of the President of 1 July 
1991 into line with the "State Program for Privatization of 
State and Municipal Enterprises in the Russian Federation," 
approved by Edict No. 2284 of the President of 24 December 1993 
with respect to determining the composition of the council of 
directors. 
  5. To approve on the whole the concept of state regulation 
of 
the investment process on the basis of the utilization of 
instruments of the stock exchange. It should be recommended to 
the Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation that it 
create a work group for developing the concept with parallel 
testing of it in a number of regions and publish it in the press 
for widespread discussion by the scholarly community. 
  6. The Commission on Securities and the stock exchange 
should 
conduct a work conference in order to develop general principles 
of depository and information activity and prevent the market 
for depository and information services from being monopolized. 
  7. Stock market professionals should be guided in their 
activity by the Code of Professional Conscience of the 
Participant in the Securities Market. 
  8. The check investment funds should create work groups for 
developing a program for the participation of the check 
investment funds in the development of the organized security 
market. The Central Check Investment Fund should be instructed 
to act on behalf of participants in the All-Russian Conference 
on Parliamentary Hearings in the State Duma of the Federal 
Assembly of the Russian Federation concerning the state 
privatization program. 
  9. Recommendations of the All-Russian Conference should be 
published in the central and regional mass media. 
  Participants in the conference consider the most important 
factor in the establishment of the stock exchange to be the 
development of depository service on the basis of the 
utilization of modern communications systems, and they note the 
positive work experience in this area of the Eurasian Regional 
Depository. Participants in the securities market may be 
interested in a new system of satellite communications developed 
with the participation of the production association Izhevskiy 
Radiozavod. It should be deemed expedient to increase the number 
of members of the group for developing a telecommunications 
system for the stock market, created in compliance with Edict 
No. 1186 of the President of October 1992, to include 
representatives of regional check investment funds, the Eurasian 
Regional Depository, and the main developers of satellite 
communications systems.

<F P=106> [Report prepared by B. Sidorenko: "International Forum of </F>
Airports"] 
  [Text] It was held in Moscow for the third time and 
was devoted to the problem of reconstruction and technical 
supply. 
  Organizers of the airport conference, which took place 
in the Sheremetyevo hotel Novotel from 13 through 15 April, were 
the Aeroport Association, the European branch of the Council of 
the ASI [expansion not indicated]-Europe, the Ministry of 
Transportation of the Russian Federation, the Government of 
Moscow, and the international airport Sheremetyevo. 
  The conference was opened by the president of the 
Aeroport Association, L. Shcheglov. Those who were gathered 
there were welcomed by Minister of Transportation of Russia V. 
Yefimov, general director of ASI-Europe F. Khamon, and the 
chairman of the Interstate Aviation Committee T. Anodina. 
  Speeches and reports were presented by the department 
chief of the Department of Air Transportation of Russia Yu. 
Baranov, first deputy director of the Aeoroporty Ukrainy 
Association A. Trotsenko, chief of the Aeroproyekt Institute V. 
Ivanov, executive director of the American company Leman Brazers 
R. Brown, chief of the commercial division of the Italian firm 
Kodest P. Gella, chief of the department of foreign relations of 
the Aeroport de Paris H. Rouaud, chairman of the 
Rosaeronavigatsiya Agency and Deputy Minister of Transportation 
of Russia V. Shelkovnikov, vice president of the Association of 
Air Transportation Operators Ye. Chibirev, and others. 
  The discussions that developed touched upon questions 
of world practice of construction and reconstruction of 
airports, the prospects for the development of airports of 
Russia, the CIS, and the Baltic countries, and also problems of 
their technical supply. 
  One of the days of the conference was entirely devoted 
to the work of the exhibition of technology and equipment. Many 
European firms that had made a good name for themselves on our 
market participated in it. Among them were the Swiss Rolba and 
Boshung, the German ABB and Kelner, the Finnish Idman, the 
French Thomson, the Czech Elektrosignal, and a number of others. 
In addition to producers of ground technology and equipment, 
construction firms also participated in the exhibition. A 
special time was set apart for presentations from firms and 
business negotiations. 
  The exhibition was viewed by members of ASI-Europe. And 
then a meeting of this representative of this European agency 
was held in Moscow for the first time. 
  We are presenting some of the reports and speeches 
heard at the conference in abridged form for the readers' 
attention. They are published on pages 2-3. 
<H5>  State Support for Renovation of Airports of Russia </H5>
  Yu. Baranov, department chief of the Department of Air 
Transportation. 
  State support for airports has a special purpose and is 
aimed 
primarily at providing for the development of their 
infrastructure and introducing advanced systems and technologies. 
  Mechanisms for state support are based on the following 
principles: 
  --the object of support is not the enterprise itself but the 
specific transportation services, facilities, or systems; 
  --for objects of state support there will be monitoring of 
costs and results and also mechanisms providing for 
unconditional utilization of funds only for their direct purpose 
will be applied; 
  --airports will receive state support, as a rule, on a 
contractual basis and according to principles of competition. 
  The investment policy is aimed at priority support for key 
projects and programs and provides for reduction of direct 
budget financing through the development of new forms of 
investment activity. 
  The network of airports of the Russian Federation, which in 
practice was formed during the preceding period, at the present 
time includes about 1,000 airports of various classes. The basis 
of the network is made up of 67 of the largest airports, which 
are considered to be federally significant. These airports 
handled 78 percent of the overall volume of dispatches in Russia 
as a whole. 
  Right up until 1990 the growth rates of the transportation 
volumes were increasing considerably but the volume of capital 
investments in the construction of airports lagged behind 
significantly. 
  At the present time a number of enterprises require 
expansion, reconstruction, and technical retooling. Some of 
them, because of ecological and production factors, must be 
moved outside the built-up urban area. The average level of 
provision of production capacities for buildings and structures 
at the present time does not exceed 69 percent. 
  The network of international airports is actually poorly 
developed. They do not have the necessary conditions, 
corresponding to the world level, for servicing airline 
passengers and handling freight. 
  The ground production base of the airports does not meet 
advanced and current requirements for economy in supporting the 
transportation process. 
  In the future there must be a slowing up of the rates of 
reduction of volumes of transportation work that is observed at 
the present time with further stabilization of shipments and 
subsequent growth of their volumes (by the year 2000--by 28 
percent, and by the year 2005--by 85 percent of the 1995 level 
for passenger transportation). Because of this, the need for 
intensive development of the production base of airports 
continues to be crucial. Changes in the geopolitical situation 
and the development of direct international communications among 
certain airports require improvement of the structure of their 
network and also support for international transportation with a 
level of service that corresponds to the world level. 
  Taking the above into account, the most important need at 
the 
present time is for improvement of the system of state 
regulation of the development of airports. One of the 
instruments for this regulation is the Program for Development 
of Airports of Russia. It was developed taking previous plans 
and program documents into account and is a constituent part of 
the State Program for Development of Air Transportation in 
Russia up to the Year 2000. 
  The implementation of the program, which is based on the 
actual condition of the production base of airports and the 
scale of the measures and also the considerable volume of 
necessary budget allocations, is envisioned in three stages. 
  The first stage is stabilization of the economic situation 
(1993-1995) and the implementation in airports of program 
measures for providing for stable functioning of air 
transportation. 
  The second stage is active implementation of the state 
structural policy (1996-2000). The implementation in priority 
airports of comprehensive and balanced development of fixed 
production capital and the growth of production capacities of 
buildings and structures in keeping with the future structure of 
the fleet of aircraft and taking into account the volumes of air 
transportation work, bringing the average level of support of 
the facilities up to the normative level. This will be carried 
out through large-scale construction and reconstruction of 
production facilities, providing for the operation of future 
mainline aircraft like the Il-96 and Tu-204 and expansion of the 
geography of flights of aircraft like the Il-86, Tu-154M, and 
Yak-42; bringing the airfields up to the requirements of the 
Norms for Summer Suitability and development of categorized 
airfields; development and expansion of the network of 
international airports (including reserve) with the construction 
of facilities that meet the world level for serving 
international airline passengers and freight; implementation of 
an extensive complex of environmental protection measures. 
  The third stage is economic growth (2001-2005), the 
implementation of a complex of program measures envisioned for 
the second stage in airports that are not included in the 
priority group. 
  Simultaneously during the time period earmarked for the 
program, individual airports that do not meet ecological 
requirements will be moved outside city limits: Omsk-2 
(completion of construction), Syktyvkar-2 (completion of 
construction), Rostov-on-Don, Bykovo (moved), and Saratov, Perm, 
and Irkutsk. 
  Investments in the program are expected to be made from the 
republic budget, investment credit, municipal (regional) 
budgets, bank credit, the internal funds of the enterprises, 
foreign investments, the creation of joint-stock companies, and 
issuance of other kinds of securities. 
  The basic directions for the development of the ground 
material and technical base during 1995-2000 include the 
following projects: 
  --construction and reconstruction of 19 artificial takeoff 
and landing strips, including in the airports of Sheremetyevo, 
Khavarovsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Anadyr, Kaliningrad, and 
others; 
  --startup of airline terminals and airline terminal 
complexes 
both for domestic lines and for international ones and also for 
international sectors with an overall handling capacity of 
36,000 passengers per hour (Sochi, Vnukovo, St. Petersburg, 
Novosibirsk, Mineralnyye Vody, Yekaterinburg, Arkhangelsk, 
Tyumen, Yakutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, and others, and 
also the Mosaviatsentr complex in Moscow); 
  --the introduction of 740,000 square meters of production 
space in hangar facilities for technical servicing of aircraft 
(Yekaterinburg, Vnukovo, Pulkovo, Magadan, Blagoveshchensk, 
Mineralnyye Vody, Novosibirsk, Tyumen, Yakutsk, Magadan, and 
others). 
  In order to develop mainline airports of federal 
significance, taking into account their role in the development 
of the economy of the Russian Federation, and to include the 
airfields of these airports in federal property, there is to be 
state support with a tendency toward reduction as a result of 
the utilization of funds of the enterprises themselves as well 
as other sources. This is confirmed by foreign practice in 
investment in the development of airports. 
  Beginning in 1993 the Ministry of Transportation of Russia 
introduced a contract system for state support of investment 
projects in order to increase the effectiveness of these 
processes in transportation and also to bring the mechanisms of 
state support for transportation enterprises, regardless of 
their forms of ownership, into compliance with conditions for 
radical economic reform. 
  The contract system envisions granting funds for state 
support, as a rule, as an additional source of financing 
projects, keeping in mind the specific obligations of the 
enterprises to mobilize their own funds for these purposes and 
also the enlistment of additional nonbudget sources of 
financing; guarantees of the utilization of the financial 
sources that are granted strictly for their intended purpose and 
fines for violation of the requirements of the contract; 
conditions for repayment of funds granted for investment 
projects; conditions for granting in exceptional cases funds for 
state support on a nonreturnable basis. 
  The investment projects are aimed at the development 
(modernization) of airports and their construction with shared 
participation of the state. 
  Within the framework of investment contracts, the following 
mechanisms are envisioned for repayment of funds from state 
support: granting of special-purpose credit with the mediation 
of commercial banks, including preferential credit; granting 
investments in exchange for shares and other securities; 
granting means of transportation and other equipment through 
leasing, including preferential. 
  In order to collect payments and interest on credit and 
conduct operations with securities issued by recipients of state 
support and to conduct leasing operations, banks, investment 
institutions, and leasing companies are enlisted on a 
contractual basis. 
  The priority areas and the maximum amount of state support 
offered on a contractual basis to airline enterprises shall be 
established for the corresponding period by a directive of the 
Ministry of Transportation. The authority to conclude and 
monitor the fulfillment of investment contracts for granting 
state support shall be assigned to the Department of Air 
Transportation. 
  Contracts will be concluded on the basis of consideration by 
a commission of applications from airline enterprises which 
contain their proposals for carrying out investment projects 
requiring state support, taking into account the recommendations 
(findings) of regional air transport administration. Investment 
contracts, including innovational ones, may be concluded on a 
competitive basis. 
  In 1993, 135.5 billion rubles [R] were spent on the 
development of air transportation from all sources of financing, 
including R52.3 billion (38.6 percent) from the federal budget. 
An important aspect was the reimbursable basis of state 
allocations allotted for the construction of air transportation 
projects. The limited state allocations were used only for the 
construction of the most important objects. 
  This provision led to a situation where the aviation 
enterprises spent R82 billion of their own funds or 60 percent 
of all the sources of financing to pay for equipment and the 
development of the ground base for airports. 
  State support was provided for the construction of the most 
important facilities, including: three complexes of airports--in 
Omsk, Syktyvkar, and Vorkuta, six takeoff and landing strips, 
five airline terminal buildings, three production facilities for 
plants, five aviation-technical bases, and other air transport 
facilities. The largest of them were: the takeoff and landing 
strips in St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Nizhniy Novgorod, and 
Volgograd, the airline terminal buildings in Khabarovsk and 
Sochi, the international sectors of airline terminals in Chita 
and Samara, production facilities in Krasnoyarsk and Khabarovsk, 
hangars in Krasnoyarsk, Arkhangelsk, Irkutsk, and Vnukovo, and a 
fuel and lubricant warehouse in Magadan. 
  International sections of airline terminal buildings were 
introduced in Chita and Samara. In Khabarovsk they introduced an 
international section and the largest airline terminal in the 
Far East that will handle 1,500 passengers per hour, airfield 
paving in Kaliningrad, a fuel and lubricant warehouse in 
Magadan, and other facilities. 
  An important part of the development of airports of Russia 
is 
the enlistment of foreign investments. In spite of the absence 
of clearcut legislation providing guarantees for foreign 
investments in the Russian aviation market, the number of 
facilities in which foreign investors participate is increasing. 
  At the present time the joint Russian-German enterprise 
Aeroport Moskva is reconstructing the Sheremetyevo-1 Airport. In 
conjunction with Japanese firms they have built the building for 
the international section for passengers in Khabarovsk. The 
joint enterprise of the airline company Air Russia, created by 
the Domodedovo Production Association and the airline company 
British Airways is completing preparatory work on the 
construction of an international airline terminal with handling 
capacity of 1,000 passengers per hour in the Domodedovo airport. 
  Agreement has been reached between the aviation enterprise 
and corporations of the United States concerning the intention 
to build an international airline terminal in Pulkovo (St. 
Petersburg) in 1994. Reconstruction of the international 
terminal in the Chita airport has been completed by the firm 
Union Engineering (Republic of Serbia) and work is being done on 
reconstruction of the takeoff and landing strip, the taxi 
strips, and parking places for aircraft. 
  In keeping with the agreement between the Ministry of 
Transportation of Russia and the U.S. corporation Leman Brazers, 
technical and economic justification is being drawn up for the 
development of the Moscow aviation center. 
  Planning work has been completed for the creation of a 
multifunctional state complex called Mosaviatsentr with the 
participation of the Main Agency of Air Communications and the 
Aerosital and Aerodroma joint ventures (Italy). The first part 
of the Center is to be started as early as 1994. 
  Work is being done to prepare technical and economic 
justification for the development of the international airport 
in Murmansk. 
  The improvement of state regulation and support for airports 
of Russia will continue in 1994. 
  Unfortunately, the practice of utilizing revenues from 
various taxes and fees exclusively for the needs of civil 
aviation adopted in other European countries is not yet in 
effect. The aforementioned factor is a significant source of 
state support for the development of airports. 
  In conclusion it should be noted that only a comprehensive 
approach and the creation of a favorable investment climate, 
acceleration of the transformation of state aviation enterprises 
into joint-stock companies taking into account their separation 
into airline companies and airports, and the accompaniment of 
effective legal and administrative measures can provide for 
proper renovation of airports of Russia. 
<H5>  Problems of Ground Service: The Operators' View </H5>
  Ye. Chibirev, vice president of the Association of Air 
Transportation Operators. 
  We are living through a time of large-scale reformation of 
civil aviation. There is the formation of market relations, the 
creation of a competitive environment, the transformation of 
forms of ownership and methods of management, the separation of 
airline detachments into airline companies and airports, and the 
generation of new management principles. 
  Unfortunately, these processes are taking place in an 
unfavorable economic, political, and social situation. Moreover, 
they are impacted negatively both by objective factors related 
to difficulties with the establishment and development of the 
new and by subjective ones caused by shortcomings in the 
activity of administrative organs, managers, and collectives. 
  There are many problems. The majority of them do not have 
simple solutions. Some of them cause conflicts of positions, 
aggravate contradictions, and lead to a struggle of interests. 
Interrelations among airline companies and airports are no 
exception here. 
  I wish to share my views on a number of issues which, in our 
opinion, are crucial. 
  Separation into airline companies and airports 
  The need to separate airport complexes from the combined 
aviation detachments as independent enterprises is not disputed 
by anyone today. 
  This is a necessary measure dictated by the logic of the 
transition to market relations. It provides for elimination of 
the technological monopoly of the combined detachment or 
production association, encourages the formation of a market for 
airline transportation and the development of competition, and 
also creates preconditions for manifestation of businesslike 
activity and enterprisingness. 
  But the separation of the airports should not lead to the 
other extreme--the appearance of structures that have the 
ability to dictate arbitrarily to the airline companies. Today's 
practice shows the active manifestation of precisely this 
tendency, which frequently not only blocks the entry of airline 
companies into the market but also places them on the verge of 
destruction. 
  The AEVT [Association of Air Transportation Operators] takes 
the following position here: The processes of separation of 
airports and their acquisition of independence should not be 
artificially retarded but should not develop spontaneously 
either. 
  Civil aviation airports, taking their natural monopolies 
into 
account, should remain in the sphere of state control and 
regulation. 
  Recognizing the transition to free rates as a progressive 
step, we nonetheless think that under the conditions of the 
absence or restriction of competition, the corresponding 
counterbalances must exist and function. 
  State management organs in conjunction with the AEVT and the 
Aeroport Association could develop proposals, taking world 
experience into account, for state regulation of airport fee 
rates and structures of expenditures when forming them. 
  The question of interrelations between airports and base 
airline companies has not been completely regulated yet. In 
addition to the contradictions that are manifested among them 
when dividing up property and the desire to encroach on the 
property interests of the airline companies, complications of a 
production-technological nature sometimes arise. 
  The AEVT is in favor of granting the airports the right to 
economic management both of the areas of land they actually 
occupy and of the areas of land in the zone of their future 
development. 
  But we are against allowing the airports to take advantage 
of 
this right to impose exorbitant conditions on the base airline 
companies for allotment of land for their aircraft. 
  In general, in keeping with international practice, certain 
airports grant certain privileges to the base airline companies. 
Possibly we should adopt this practice. 
  The question of the prices of airline fuel remains critical. 
Perhaps the world has never known such price "disparities" in 
the various regions, such price hikes, such unregulated price 
setting. The situation of the airline carriers in this chaos 
requires no comment. 
  We are assuming that prices of airline fuel should be 
regulated by the state and the value added tax on it should be 
abolished. 
  The creation of Rosaeronavigatsiya and the formation of 
IVP [expansion not indicated] and UVD [air traffic control] 
enterprises 
  The AEVT does not support the aspiration of 
Rosaeronavigatsiya to take over all the means of radio technical 
support and communications. 
  We think that this would cause serious harm to civil 
aviation. Air traffic control services, radio technical support 
for flights, and communications in the airfield zone (takeoff, 
landing, circuit) should remain with the airports. This will 
make it possible to provide for renovation and modernization of 
airport means of air traffic control and also maintain unity of 
the technological process. 
  Discriminatory practice of airports with respect to 
domestic airline companies 
  We most decisively object to this. 
  The cost of airport fees on aircraft of Russian airline 
companies in the Russian Federation exceeds severalfold the cost 
of fees on aircraft of foreign airline companies or domestic 
aircraft and helicopters leased by them. 
  The cost of one hour of parking of an aircraft of a Russian 
airline company in an airport amounts to 25 percent of the cost 
of takeoff and landing. At the same time the cost of parking an 
aircraft carrying a foreign flag for 24 hours is only 10 percent 
of the cost of takeoff and landing. For example, in the Vnukovo 
airport 10 hours of parking an An-12 of a Russian airline 
company costs R1 million and for 24 hours parking of an An-12 
under a foreign flag--only $77 (R89,000)--less than half as much 
for parking more than twice as long! 
  Nonstate airline companies groan under this burden and are 
forced to pay for a foreign flag in order to avoid such fees. 
  We think that the policy for forming prices for airport fees 
and services should correspond to the principles of the various 
possibilities indicated in Article 15 of the Chicago Convention. 
  Interrelations between airline companies and 
airports 
  Now they do not have a clear-cut normative-legal base and, 
consequently, clearly designated obligations and 
responsibilities of the parties. 
  This has a negative effect on the art of service to the 
passengers, the safety of flights, and the economic effect. 
  Unfortunately we cannot say that separating previously 
consolidated airline detachments into airline companies and 
airports has already produced positive results with respect to 
these extremely important criteria. 
  The airline company and the airport are closely connected 
technologically and efforts, say, to improve the art of service 
of passengers on board could be nullified by the lack of the 
same on the ground. 
  Apparently it is time to resolutely change to a contractual 
basis for interrelations. 
  The airport is obliged to guarantee and provide for a 
certain 
list of conditions and services for airline companies just as 
the airline company has obligations to take certain actions when 
continuing a trip in an emergency situation, when an aircraft is 
malfunctioning, when there is no aircraft fuel, etc. 
  And agreements between the aviation base and the airline 
company making flights through the airport, naturally, must vary. 
  The AEVT is prepared to become involved in the work for 
preparing drafts of standard agreements. 
  Information support 
  So far we do not have a necessary and sufficient field of 
information for successful operation of airline companies. 
  Airport fees, the prices of aircraft fuel, the conditions 
for 
service, the list of services rendered, etc., with constantly 
changing values, are making the adoption of decisions to make 
air shipments by airline companies a task with many unknowns. It 
is no accident that attempts to make these decisions end up in 
losses. It cannot be ruled out that the airports are also losing 
a great deal here. 
  Possibly we should jointly think about a system and 
mechanism 
for information support for airline companies and airports 
taking their needs and interests into account. 
  Structural rearrangement 
  We think that in the stage of separation of consolidated 
aviation detachments it would be inexpedient to separate them 
into more than two independent enterprises (airport and airline 
company). Separating the ATB [aircraft maintenance base] into an 
independent enterprise would be inexpedient in this case. The 
exception might be cases where centers (regional) for technical 
service and repair of aircraft are created. 
  As for subdivisions of shops for operational technical 
service, ideally they should be attached to the airport. If they 
belong to the airline companies and there is no such service in 
the airport, it places them in a monopolistic position. 
  But in this stage, in our opinion, the task is hard to carry 
out. Therefore the base airline company must be an object of 
special antimonopoly control and regulation. 
  Regarding these and many other questions the AEVT could 
cooperate productively with the Aeroport Association. The basis 
for our interaction has been laid. It is now a matter of 
developing it. 
<H5>  Paths to the Development of Airport Complex of Ukraine </H5>
  A. Trotsenko, first deputy director of the Airports of 
Ukraine Association 
  The Ministry of Transportation of Ukraine has approved a 
plan 
for administration of civil aviation enterprises. In order to 
provide the conditions necessary for its establishment and 
development, the effective use of aviation equipment, the 
development of a ground base, and improvement of its ability to 
compete, on the basis of enterprises of the former Ukrainian 
civil aviation association the following have been formed: the 
Ukrainian civil aviation association Airports of Ukraine; the 
Ukrainian state airline company Airlines of Ukraine; the airline 
company International Airlines of Ukraine; the airline company 
Cargo Airlines of Ukraine; and the airline company Application 
of Aviation in the National Economy. In November 1993 the 
concept was approved for dividing the OAO [expansion not 
indicated] into independent state enterprises--airports and 
regional branches of airline companies. The concept envisions 
the division of the functions between airports and airline 
companies and the corresponding division of services and 
property of the OAO as well as division of funds and facilities 
for social purposes. 
  This method has already been used to single out 12 airports, 
and this process is continuing. Leaders of five OAO's 
(Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa, Lvov, Donetsk, and Lugansk) did not 
agree to the division in the first stage. 
  With the ministry's consent they are creating the consortium 
Ukrtransavia made of these OAO's with subsequent division and 
separation of independent airports. This way they will prolong 
the process of separation by two or three years. 
  The Airports of Ukraine association, which includes 12 
airports, has been instructed by the Ministry of Transportation 
to handle questions of capital construction, reconstruction, and 
retooling for all civil aviation facilities of Ukraine. 
  It must be noted that civil aviation in Ukraine, as in other 
CIS states, is experiencing great difficulties. This was brought 
about by the breakdown of economic ties, and the large increase 
in the cost of energy resources, above all aircraft fuel. 
Therefore the volume of air shipments within Ukraine during the 
past three years has decreased 10-fold, which has caused them to 
operate at a loss. At the same time the amount of air freight is 
increasing on international lines. There is also a larger number 
of airports with access to international airlines. 
  At the present time we are working out a concept for the 
development of civil aviation of Ukraine which envisions: 
reconstruction and retooling of the ground base for airports in 
Borispol, Odessa, Lvov, and Kharkov; reconstruction and 
retooling for international flights at airports of Donetsk, 
Kharkov, Uzhgorod, and Dnepropetrovsk; the construction of new 
airline terminals in Kiev (Zhulyany), Sumy, Khmelnitskiy, Lvov, 
Kharkov, Odessa, and Borispol; the construction of takeoff and 
landing strips in Kirovograd and Borispol. 
  Until 1992 there were four airports in Ukraine with the 
status of international: Borispol, Simferopol, Odessa, and Lvov. 
As of today 14 of the 36 airports of Ukraine are conducting 
regular or chartered international flights to countries of 
Europe, Asia, and America. 
  A government decree and the Ministry of Transportation of 
Ukraine have earmarked reconstruction and building of airline 
terminals for international airline travel in 30 large 
population points of Ukraine, and it will be necessary to do a 
considerable amount of construction and installation work in the 
airports of Zaporozhye, Kirovograd, Poltava, Sumy, Ternopol, 
Zhitomir, Lutsk, Berdyansk, Izmail, Kerch, Severodonetsk, and 
others. 
  The concept for the development of civil aviation of Ukraine 
envisions the reconstruction of the Borispol airport, which will 
be done in two sections. First it is planned to complete 
reconstruction of the existing airline terminal, takeoff and 
landing strip No. 1, and the construction of the new airline 
terminal. A second section includes the reconstruction of 
takeoff and landing strip No. 2 and the construction of the 
cargo terminal and the hangar facilities. 
  An international auction was announced for reconstruction of 
the first section in which the following participated: the 
American firm Hughes, the German Hoftiech, the French Spi 
Batilol [name as transliterated] and Bung, the British Costain, 
and a number of others. One of the main requirements under the 
conditions of the auction was the organization by the firm of 
the acquisition of credit in Western banks for the Borispol 
airport. The bidding commission, appointed by the Government of 
Ukraine, awarded first place to the French firm Bung. The 
results of the auction were announced in March 1992. For six 
months the Bung firm, which won the bidding, was not able to 
document the acquisition of credit for the Borispol airport and 
a new decision was made: to complete the reconstruction of the 
first section facility by facility. 
  Credit for reconstruction of the terminal was granted by the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Eximbank. 
  An auction in conjunction with the EBRD was also declared 
for 
the delivery of equipment for the airline terminal. 
  About 30 foreign firms participated in the auction with 
concrete proposals for the delivery of technological equipment 
for the airline terminal complex. 
  According to the conditions of the auction the firms have to 
deliver, install, adjust, and release their equipment turnkey. 
  In the near future bidding will be announced for 
participation in investment in the reconstruction of Borispol 
takeoff and landing strip-1 and the delivery of equipment for 
this facility. 
  According to the contract, the reconstruction of the 
existing 
airline terminal should be completed in 1994, and in 1995-1996 
it is intended to complete the reconstruction of takeoff and 
landing strip No. 1, which will be lengthened to 4 kilometers 
and equipped with a system for aircraft landing that will make 
it possible for the Borispol airport to receive all the large 
modern aircraft of both domestic and foreign airline companies. 
  Improvement of the ground base for the airports is an 
inseparable part of raising the level of effectiveness of the 
work of air transportation. It is important to the passenger not 
only to fly from one geographical point to another, but also to 
do this with maximum convenience. The size of the aircraft fleet 
in and of itself cannot guarantee the flourishing of air 
transportation and its prestige. It is not a matter of aircraft 
but of the effectiveness of their use and the quality of 
service. It is very important to proceed from the idea that 
reconstruction and retooling of airports with the introduction 
of principally new technologies provide for the greatest results 
from the operation of air transportation; reconstruction of 
VPP's and equipping them with the latest means of landing and 
air traffic control will increase the safety and regularity of 
the flights; the compliance of systems of lighting equipment and 
electrical supply circuits with the requirements of the world 
level is one of the constituent parts of the guarantee of 
regularity and safety of flights; supplying the airports with 
new technology, equipment, means of mechanization and automation 
for serving passengers and maintaining airline terminals 
increases the comfort and the art of service for the passengers. 
  As we know, in the financial activity of foreign airports 
aviation fees make up 60-70 percent. The remainder--30-40 
percent--the airports obtain from extensive non-aviation 
activity. Reconstruction and retooling of existing production 
capacities of airports offer many possibilities for creating 
sources of income for the airport. They include: the hotel 
business, ground transportation, leasing of space, buildings, 
and GSM capacities, commercial stores and kiosks, leasing 
points, motor vehicle parking places, and other kinds of 
services.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Shprygin, president of the Center for Study </F>
of the Conditions of Prices and the Market (Tsenakor) of 
EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN, corresponding member of the Russian Academy 
of Economic Sciences: "Price as a Lever of Financial 
Stabilization"] 
  [Text] In countries with a developed market economy, 
stabilization of the financial system and support for the 
processes of the normal functioning of the market are realized 
by means of a whole system of economic levers, a key place among 
which is occupied by prices. 
  Prices operate simultaneously both as an important 
instrument 
of control and as an object of government regulation. Having 
liberated prices, Russia abandoned both, finding itself, in 
fact, thereby the sole country which had taken the path of 
complete self-elimination of the state from a controlling impact 
on prices. This was quickly reflected in the results of 
management in a thousandfold-plus growth of prices of almost all 
commodities produced in the country and the complete 
disorganization of control of the economy. Inasmuch as prices 
under acute shortage conditions compensate enterprises for 
virtually all product costs, prices have ceased under the 
current irrational production structure to influence qualitative 
changes in production. 
  As a result we are increasingly acquiring a warped economy. 
What under normal conditions, according to the laws of the 
market economy, should be efficient and, in keeping with this, 
have high prices is in our deformed production structure proving 
cheap, and the less efficient product, more costly. 
  As a consequence, the production structure of Russia is 
becoming increasingly less efficient and is lagging increasingly 
noticeably behind countries with a controlled market economy 
like the United States, Japan, the FRG, and others. There are 
simultaneously increasing contradictions between the interests 
of individual enterprises and the long-term interests of all of 
society. This is being manifested particularly graphically in 
the sphere of investments, when long-term investments in 
production, which are beneficial from the viewpoint of the 
national economy as a whole, are proving disadvantageous from 
the viewpoint of the current interests of private entrepreneurs. 
As a result, whereas countries with controlled prices have an 
opportunity to influence with them inefficient industries and 
thereby effect progressive structural transformations, we are 
increasingly losing this opportunity. 
  There are today few people who believe that under the 
current 
conditions the market is capable independently, without the 
intervention of the state, of effectively regulating the 
proportions of the national economy. The production and 
financial disproportions have become so deep that continuation 
of the chosen price policy makes it, in view of its destructive 
nature, not only pointless but also dangerous for the economic 
system. These disproportions cannot be rectified by means of an 
improvement in the financial system alone inasmuch as the state 
thereof, in turn, depends on the state of the system of prices 
itself. Their rectification, together with the use of methods of 
market regulation, requires the active intervention of the state 
in the regulation of pricing processes. We can hardly, for 
example, agree with the current pricing practice, whereby 
significant amounts of national income created in agriculture 
and the fuel sectors are via the prices of the products coming 
into these sectors being withdrawn from them, and then the 
state, by means of a variety of privileges and subsidies, 
returns to these sectors the funds withdrawn from them. 
Specifically, by means at this time of a nonequivalent increase 
in the efficiency of products thanks to an increase in the price 
(not counting inflation) of metal, mechanical engineering 
products, electric power, and timber approximately 14 percent of 
the national income created in coal industry is being withdrawn 
from this sector, and then, by means of the establishment of a 
special tax on the prices of the products of the other sectors, 
the state returns to this sector some of the national income 
withdrawn from it. What, one wonders, is the point of 
introducing special taxes and thereby ratcheting up the already 
high inflation even more when all questions connected with the 
assurance of normal economic conditions for the functioning of 
the sector may be settled by means of the establishment of 
prices objectively estimating the equivalence of exchange of the 
results of labor between sector and the utility of the product 
they create? Unfortunately, this is not being done. 
  Approximately the same situation is taking shape in certain 
other sectors of natural resource use also.

  It is not surprising that these sectors are permanently in a 
difficult economic situation and are experiencing a chronic 
shortage of financial resources. Whereas the sectors of natural 
resource use are losing a substantial part of national income, 
it is accumulating in surplus in certain manufacturing sectors, 
on the other hand. Thus in mechanical engineering surplus 
national income in connection with the higher rate of growth of 
prices compared with the increase in the efficiency (consumer 
properties) of the machinery, not counting inflation, 
constitutes approximately 35 percent, and in commerce, 60 
percent. As a result, whereas the efficiency of the sectors of 
natural resource use is declining on account of the permanent 
shortage of financial resources, the efficiency of the 
manufacturing sectors, mechanical engineering particularly, is 
declining as a consequence of their reduced competitiveness 
caused by the disproportionate growth of product efficiency by 
increased prices. 
  Whereas here mechanical engineering withdraws to its 
advantage via prices per comparable amounts of exchangeable 
products from the fuel sectors, power engineering, iron and 
steel industry, timber industry, and other sectors of the 
national economy up to 40-45 percent altogether of the national 
income created in these sectors, it, in turn, redistributes some 
of the national income created in it (up to 10 percent) to the 
servicing sectors. With such a price policy the financial system 
becomes extremely muddled and increasingly less capable, and 
cost proportions and the actual picture of the aggregate product 
created in the sectors are distorted. As a result, all 
incentives to labor are lost and the fledgling market relations 
are destroyed. 
  The state must determine for the market, therefore, insofar 
as it is not yet itself in a position to do this efficiently, 
progressive price proportions in the exchange of what are for it 
the most important products. But it must not compel the 
manufacturer to make products which are unprofitable for him. 
The manufacturer himself should decide what kind of products he 
will manufacture. We see also in the determination of basic 
price proportions the state's role as equal participant in 
market relations. It should in this connection occupy a more 
active position in the harmonization of price proportions and 
the estimates of the costs of labor in its exchange between 
sectors and the most important industries inasmuch as the 
objectiveness of the commensuration of the costs and the results 
of labor depend on this, and the justification of the levels of 
pay, pensions, allowances, and other monetary payments are 
likewise dependent. It has to be stated that in connection with 
the growth in price disproportions the value assessment of the 
labor of employees of the base sectors of the national economy 
frequently proves to be unjustifiably understated compared with 
the labor of employees of the nonproduction spheres. Thus the 
value assessment of the heavy and dangerous labor of miners and 
iron and steel industry workers, counting withholdings from pay, 
constitutes at the present time approximately 45 percent of the 
valuation of the labor of employees of commerce, who receive 
their pay immediately following the sale of a commodity. As far, 
on the other hand, as the valuation of the labor of a scientist 
is concerned, it constitutes an even lesser value--26 percent. 
Thus as a result of the distortion of the price proportions 
directly influencing the proportions of distribution of the 
national income into the accumulation fund and consumption fund 
and, thereby, the proportions of remuneration, the employees of 
the base sectors of the national economy have come to be the 
least socially protected. It is not surprising that it is in the 
sectors of material production that the greatest decline in 
productivity is occurring and that a recession is observed. 
  In need of government regulation today are the price 
proportions of the sectors of the fuel and energy complex, 
transport, and the base industries of mechanical engineering and 
also the price proportions between agriculture and industry, 
which are today shaping up to the disadvantage of agriculture 
and throwing its economy back to the level of the end of the 
1970's. 
  Agriculture has always been a sector at whose expense other 
sectors of the national economy have developed, which has left 
its mark on its production structure and led to the engineering 
backwardness of the sector. As a result, the sector cannot 
compete in many processes with other countries. 
  There is in the agriculture of Russia today a production 
structure and specialization of production engineering processes 
which took shape under the conditions of the business relations 
of the former USSR with a command system of management, when it 
was planned for each kolkhoz and sovkhoz what would be produced 
when and in what quantity and to whom the products would be 
supplied. This production structure was oriented toward 
large-scale production, to whose servicing industry was adapted 
also. 
  We have to come to terms with this. It is essential also to 
consider that agriculture is tied to land which farms have 
cultivated for many decades and which has, therefore, techniques 
adapted to the production of strictly defined crops. Changing 
this production structure which has evolved in the 
agro-industrial complex will take much time and large resources, 
which the state does not have. 
  Agriculture cannot under these conditions be approached with 
the same yardsticks of price liberalization with which we 
approached industry, especially since in respect to industry 
this policy has proven ineffective. With its technical 
backwardness and inadequate competitiveness, agriculture will be 
in need of government support for a long time to come. 
  The efficiency of the government's price policy in respect 
to 
agriculture, therefore, consists not, having set free prices in 
this sector, in distancing itself from the support of 
agriculture as quickly as possible but in creating by means of 
price privileges and a variety of preferences incentives to the 
concentration of the production of agricultural produce in the 
most favorable areas of its commodity production. 
  A most effective way of influencing production is the 
stimulation by prices of resource-saving, and via this, a 
reduction in the product's prime costs, that is, developing 
production thanks to economies in resources approximately 3-3.5 
times more cheaply than thanks to the development of new 
deposits and the attraction of new resources. 
  The acquisition by the state of extra revenue thanks to a 
reduction in prime production costs, not thanks to an increase 
in prices, should be the main direction of the price and 
financial policy of the state. It is essential in this 
connection to return to the practice, which existed previously 
and which gave a positive account of itself, of the 
determination of ceiling prices showing the upper limits of 
prices within which the purchase of products is for the consumer 
efficient. This would enhance the role of the consumers in 
pricing processes and simultaneously prompt the manufacturers to 
reduce production costs. 
  World market prices are a special question. Many economists 
are speaking of the need for the prices of the domestic market 
to be aligned with those of world markets. But this cannot be 
done. So-called "world" prices are the national prices of 
individual countries reflecting the production costs that exist 
in these countries and their technical development levels and 
also the correlations that exist in these countries in the 
levels of the remuneration of employees and incapable members of 
society, which with us, as shown above, are distorted. In this 
connection, adapting our domestic prices to the prices of other 
countries, we would not only destroy the business ties and 
techniques that have been created with great difficulty over 
many years and thereby undermine production even more but also 
conclusively destroy the economy. 
  The transition to market relations requires a linkage 
between 
the pricing processes occurring at the macrolevel and prices at 
the level of enterprises, individual territories, commodity 
manufacturers, and the consumers. In order to protect the 
interests of each participant in social production against any 
arbitrary action, against the unwarranted intervention of the 
state in pricing processes included, it is essential to draw up 
a special pricing law by analogy with the laws that exist in all 
countries with a developed market economy. Without this, the 
current chaos in the economy will continue.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Smirnova, candidate of economic sciences </F>
and chief researcher at the Central Economic Scientific Research 
Institute of the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics: "The 
Government Is Preparing Pension Reform: An Increase in the 
Minimum Pension Is for the Present Decreasing the Maximum 
Pension"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Protection </H5>
  Pension reform has already been talked about for a long time 
in circles that have a direct bearing on its implementation. 
Pensioners have turned out to be one of the most socially 
unprotected categories of the population. Even though people who 
have worked honestly all their lives have a right to count on 
the support of the state and a fitting old age. 
  Pension reform is still at the revision stage, but it 
appears 
that its main outlines have already been drawn. In particular, 
it is most likely that the procedure for recalculation of the 
size of pensions in connection with the increase in prices for 
consumer goods and services that has been worked out to the 
present time will be retained. Periodically (for example, once a 
quarter), the old age pensions computed by the social insurance 
organs will be increased either by a specific sum (called 
"compensation"), or by a specific percentage ("indexation"). 
  But two questions arise: Which variant is better? And will 
the increased pension cover the increase in prices? Let us try 
to analyze this. Until November 1993 the recalculation of 
pensions was conducted by means of indexation of its previously 
computed quantity in accordance with the price increase index. 
If in the quarter prices grew by a factor of 1.9, the pension 
was correspondingly increased by a factor of 1.9; its purchasing 
power did not change, i.e., the quantity of goods and services a 
pensioner could pay for remained unchanged. 
  In November, instead of the regular indexation of pensions 
the government introduced "compensation" for price increases. 
All pensions were increased by one and the same figure--11,700 
rubles [R]. This procedure was repeated in February 1994. Every 
pensioner received a pension addition of R8,000. The thesis of 
social justice was advanced as the main argument for the 
transition to this form, inasmuch as it guaranteed a greater 
degree of social support of pensioners who receive the minimum 
pension and who are in the most difficult material situation. 
  As a matter of fact, the change in the compensation method 
of 
recalculating pensions was obviously made for the purpose of 
saving the monetary resources of the state budget and the 
Pension Fund (which turned out to be practically empty at the 
end of October), and had little to do with the principle of 
social justice. 
  The introduction of additions to pensions did not ensure 
compensation for price increases even at its minimum size, 
although theoretically they were supposed to be calculated in a 
percentage term precisely from the minimum pension. The first 
compensation sum was determined precisely this way: For the 
August-October period prices increased by a factor of 1.8, or 
180 percent. The compensation amount was R11,700 (80 percent of 
the minimum pension of R14,620), and accordingly the minimum sum 
of payments totaled R26,320 (more than the minimum pension by a 
factor of 1.8). However, over November-January, with a price 
increase of a factor of 1.6, the minimum pension was increased 
by a factor of 1.3. This occurred because the February 
compensation (R8,000) was established not on the actual minimum 
pension (R26,320) but based on its official value, which 
remained unchanged. It was this figure that was indexed in 
accordance with the increase in prices. But the purchasing power 
of the remaining part of the pension was correspondingly 
decreased by a factor of 1.6. 
  The change in the procedure for revising pensions was 
reflected in a substantially more negative way on pensioners who 
had a pension that was higher than the minimum, since an even 
lesser part of the pension was indexed for them. Thus, for 
example, the purchasing power of a maximum old age pension (the 
size of which in August 1993 was R52,632, given a length of 
service of 40 years and more, and in February 1994--R72,332) was 
reduced by more than a factor of two (with an increase in prices 
for this period of a factor of 2.9, the pension increased by a 
factor of 1.37). 
  If the indexation procedure for revising pensions had been 
maintained, in February 1994 the minimum pension would have 
totaled R42,100 instead of R34,320 (14,620 + 11,700 + 8,000), 
and the maximum--R153,000, which is comparable to the average 
wage in February. However, a 1:2 ratio of maximum old age 
pension to average wage cannot be considered satisfactory, 
taking into account the fact that the question concerns 
specifically the maximum value of a pension, whose reference 
point should be the 75 percent level of the wage that a worker 
receives. As a result of the use of the compensation method, a 
substantial reduction occurred in the ratio between the maximum 
and minimum old age pension from 3.6:1 to 2.1:1, which reduced 
the importance of work length of service and professional 
qualifications and appropriately aroused the indignation of 
pensioners who had worked all their lives. 
  In May the government once again returned to the indexation 
method of recalculating pensions, increasing previously 
calculated pensions by a factor of 1.3 (according to the 
statistics of the State Committee for Statistics of the Russian 
Federation, prices increased this much in the February-May 
period). Thus, the minimum pension was R19,000 (14,620 x 1.3), 
which was also fixed as the official minimum. Added to this is 
the previously introduced compensation of R19,700, giving a 
total of R38,700. It would seem that this time the increase in 
computed pensions covered the increase in prices, but it turns 
out that by far not all pensioners can be happy. 
  In accordance with pension legislation in effect, old age 
pensions cannot exceed three of its minimum values. And 
although the minimum pension in May amounts to R38,700, the 
official minimum of R19,000 is used for calculating the 
"ceiling." But the "ceiling" itself in May is being determined 
in the following way: Three minimum pensions (R19,000 x 3 = 
R57,000) plus compensation (R19,700)--for a total of R76,700. 
Additional percentages for length of service can increase the 
first constituted maximum pension up to R68,400 (given a length 
of service of 40 years and more). If, in addition, a person was 
born before 1931, it is considered that he worked during the 
war, and he can count on another 50 percent of the minimum 
pension; i.e., R9,500. Totaling the enumerated figures, we get 
R97,600. 
  Thus, those whose pensions, calculated before May 1994, were 
more than R75,077 (taking all additions into account) will not 
be able to use the results of the May indexation of pensions in 
full measure, and the purchasing power of their pensions will be 
reduced once more. Naturally there is no question of any kind of 
compensation for previous debts to pensioners. 
  In April 1994 a revision was started of the base for 
calculating pensions for those formulated before 1993, with an 
increase of a factor of 1.8. This measure is directed at 
correcting errors committed in establishing the coefficients for 
"updating" past earnings. Undoubtedly, it will make it possible 
to improve the material situation of a rather numerous category 
of pensioners; however, in this case as well, those whose 
pension was less (did not exceed R27,000) will end up winning 
most. For the others, the limiter on increasing the scale of 
pensions will be the very same old age pension "ceiling," and 
the increase in the base of the calculation by a factor of 1.8 
will not lead to a corresponding increase in pensions. 
  Everything that has been said makes it possible to come to 
the conclusion that the measures being undertaken by the 
government for regulating pensions, while ensuring a certain 
protection of the incomes of pensioners from inflation, do not 
fully compensate for price increases. The more pension a person 
receives, the less compensation, consequently a leveling of 
pensions is occurring regardless of preceding work contribution.

<H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>
  Over the period 26 April to 4 May 1994 prices for 
consumer goods and services rose by 2.2 percent, including for 
foodstuffs--by 1.9 percent, nonfood items--by 2.3 percent, and 
for-fee services for the population--by 3.8 percent. 
  The greatest increases in food prices were registered in the 
Central Chernozem region (3.9 percent), and the lowest--in the 
Northeast region (1.0 percent); they remained at practically the 
same level in Kaliningrad Oblast. Prices for nonfood items went 
up most in the Urals region--by 6 percent, while in the cities 
of Northwestern and Central Chernozem regions they changed only 
insignificantly. 
  Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in the 
consumer market were as follows (percentage of the preceding 
date):

<H5>  Foodstuffs. </H5>
  Over the period 26 April to 4 May, prices in organized and 
nonorganized trade rose by 1.1 percent and 5.4 percent. 
  Price changes by main categories of food products are shown

  In organized trade over the elapsed week fruit and 
vegetable prices rose at an anticipatory rate. Prices for 
cabbage, onions, and apples rose by 4-7 percent. Prices for 
rye-wheat bread and bread made of highest grade wheat flour, 
macaroni, rice, millet, and salt went up by 2-3 percent. There 
was practically no change over the week in prices for vodka, 
sugar, butter, and vegetable oil. 
  Similar to organized trade, the greatest price increases 
in nonorganized trade, mostly due to seasonal factors 
and holidays, were registered with respect to fresh produce. 
Prices for apples, cabbage, and onions rose over the week by 
10-13 percent, carrots, beets, and garlic--by 4-9 percent. 
Prices for meat products increased by 5-6 percent, and for eggs 
remained practically unchanged. 
  The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic 
foodstuffs increased over the week by 1.9 percent and as of 
4 May amounted to 48,500 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly 
basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured 
a factor of 4.6; the highest cost of the basket was registered 
in Magadan (R131,100) and the lowest--in Ulyanovsk (R28,700). In 
terms of the consumer basket cost, Moscow and St. Petersburg and 
Moscow ranked 34th and 42d among 132 monitored cities (R53,300 
and R49,800 on a monthly basis). 
<H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>
  Over the period 26 April to 4 May, prices for nonfood items 
rose at a somewhat higher rate than those for foodstuffs. The 
greatest price increases were registered with respect to 
children's items, wallpaper, and medicines (2-5 percent). 
Gasoline prices in 12 cities of Russia increased over the week 
by 10-30 percent. With the average for Russia price of R288 per 
liter, the highest price was registered in Magadan--R520 per 
liter, and the lowest--in Norilsk--R120. 
<H5>  For-Fee Services for the Population </H5>
  Over the elapsed week the cost of certain services continued 
to rise at an anticipatory rate--rents in municipal housing 
(20.5 percent), municipal services (6-8 percent), and 
transportation and communications services (5-6 percent). The 
cost of housing and municipal services increased several-fold in 
Ivanovo and Chelyabinsk Oblasts. There was a 1.5- to two-fold 
increase in urban bus fares in Izhevsk, Novosibirsk, Smolensk, 
Cherepovets, Blagoveshchensk, Nizhniy Tagil, and Kopeysk, and in 
the cost of residential telephone service in Petrozavodsk, 
Irkutsk, Serov, Nizhniy Tagil, and cities in Tatarstan. 
<H5>  Wholesale Prices for Industrial Output </H5>
  Wholesale prices for industrial output in April 
increased by 10 percent (in April 1993--by 21 percent). As 
compared to December 1993, prices increased 1.7-fold (over the 
same period of 1993--2.5-fold). Also in April, as during the 
preceding months, prices for producer goods increased more 
significantly than those for consumer goods, which can be seen 
from the following data (% of the preceding month): 


                    January     February     March     April     April 1994 
                    1994        1994         1994      1994      as % of

                                                                 1993 

Industry--total     119         116          110       110       167 

including: 

producer goods      120         117          111       112       171 

consumer goods      113         113          109       108       152 


  Since the beginning of the year prices have risen the least 
in electric power generation, the fuel industry, nonferrous 
metallurgy, and the chemical, timber, woodworking, pulp and 
paper, and food processing industries--by 6-11 percent. 
  In the fuel industry over the month prices for 
main categories of fuels went up by 6 percent on average. The 
greatest price increases--by 18 percent--were registered with 
respect to gas; coal prices went up by 13 percent, oil--by 5 
percent, and petroleum products--by 3 percent. 
  By the end of April the price of one tonne of oil in Tyumen 
Oblast was R69,000, and in Republic of Tatarstan--R54,000. Coal 
in the main coal-producing regions--Kemerovo and Rostov 
Oblasts--cost R18,000 and R25,000 per tonne, and in Republic of 
Komi--R29,000. Wholesale prices charged by gas-producing 
enterprises exceeded R6,000 per 1,000 cubic meters. Since the 
beginning of the year gas prices have increased fourfold, 
oil--1.9-fold, and coal--1.6-fold. Electric power 
rates at the end of April averaged R31 per kw-hour for all 
categories of consumers, which is 1.7 times higher than in 
December 1993. 
  In ferrous metallurgy after a relatively low rate 
of price increases at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994, 
prices for most categories of output went up sharply. With 
respect to many monitored categories of output the rate of price 
increases was considerably higher than over the quarter. For 
instance, prices for stainless round billet in April went up by 
84 percent (overall over the quarter--by 20 percent), 
open-hearth steel--37 percent (7 percent), wire rod--22 percent 
(4 percent), and hollow drill steel--by 36 percent (9 percent). 
Iron ore prices increased in April by almost 40 percent, which 
is three times as much as over the quarter (14 percent). 
  In the chemical and petrochemical industry, with 
an average price increase of 11 percent, prices for some 
products rose at a faster rate: carbamide and epoxy resins--by 
22-25 percent; paints, varnishes, and synthetic dyes, tires for 
trucks and cars--by 18 percent; the output of rubber and 
asbestos industry--by 17 percent; and mineral fertilizer--by 14 
percent. There have been substantial price increases (by a 
factor of two to 2.3) since the beginning of the year for 
nepheline concentrate, sulfur, mineral fertilizer, yellow 
phosphorus, sulfuric and hydrochloric acid, drying oils, 
synthetic detergents, and some other products. 
  Price rises continue to slow down in the timber, 
woodworking, and pulp and paper industry. Over April prices 
here rose on average by 9 percent (11 percent in March). Prices 
for the output of the timber-logging sector increased over the 
month by 7 percent, and since the beginning of the 
year--1.5-fold; that of the woodworking industry--by 11 percent 
and 1.7-fold, respectively; and pulp and paper industry--by 9 
percent and 1.8-fold. 
  Similar to March, the price index for construction 
material in April was higher than the industry average--113 
percent. Prices for construction brick, roof slate, wall panels, 
and ceramic tile increased by more than 13-15 percent; 
prefabricated ferroconcrete components and parts, construction 
and non-ore materials, mineral cotton and items made of it--by 
11-12 percent. As compared to December 1993 the price level with 
respect to cement, roof slate, asbestos-cement pipe, 
construction lime, and ferroconcrete blocks practically doubled. 
  In light industry prices rose on average by 12 
percent, including for cotton fabrics--by 9 percent, woolen 
fabrics--by 14 percent, and silk fabrics--by 11 percent. Prices 
for knit underwear and outer knitwear increased by 7-9 percent, 
garments and footwear--by 11 percent. Since the beginning of the 
year prices increased on average 1.5-fold, and with respect to 
some varieties of goods (cotton thread, gauze, dressmaking linen 
fabrics, silk fabrics, twine, and women's 
pantyhose)--1.8-1.9-fold. 
  In the food processing industry in April prices 
for some varieties of butter-churning, milk, fats and oils, and 
fruit and vegetable industry output remained practically 
unchanged. Prices for meat and fish products and the output of 
milling and cereal-making industry rose on average by 4-6 
percent. Since the beginning of the year prices for the output 
of baking, macaroni, hard liquor, beer-brewing, salt, perfume 
and cosmetics, and soft drinks sectors have increased 
1.7-2.0-fold. 
  Price changes by industrial sectors are shown below:

<H5>  Market Saturation With Consumer Goods </H5>
  Over the past two months the level of retail trade 
saturation 
with goods remained unchanged and measured 87 
percent.[.sup]*)[/] In April of this year, as compared to 
April of last year, it increased by 16 percentage 
points.[.sup]**)[/] 
  With respect to foodstuffs, the saturation coefficient over 
the elapsed month measured 84 percent as compared to 62 percent 
in April of last year. Russia's consumer market is currently 
saturated with butter and eggs. The saturation level is also 
high (97-99 percent) with respect to beef, poultry meat, summer 
salami and bologna, vegetable oil, sour cream, milk, sugar, and 
vermicelli. 
  The situation at regional markets with such food products as 
fish, cottage cheese, rye-wheat bread, and macaroni items is

  In the first quarter of this year the situation was more 
favorable with respect to production of fuel for the needs of 
power generating stations and boiler rooms, as well as winter 
fuel for transport. 
  As compared to the analogous period of last year, the output 
of winter diesel fuel increased by 8 percent and amounted to 2.6 
million tonnes. While in absolute figures the output of boiler 
oil declined, its share in the total volume of petroleum 
products production increased from 38 percent in January-March 
1993 to 41 percent in January-March of this year. At the same 
time, production of household furnace fuel decreased over the 
indicated period of time by 23 percent. 
  Because of the decline in solvent demand, production of 
petroleum products for the needs of aviation declined 
considerably. The output of aviation oil and gasoline fell by a 
factor of three as compared to the first quarter of last year, 
that of aviation kerosene--by 20 percent. Production of aviation 
gasoline decreased by a factor of six in the Omsknefteorgsintez 
association, and of aviation kerosene--by half in 
Kirishinefteorgsintez, and one-quarter--in the 
Yaroslavnefteorgsintez association and the Moscow NPZ 
[oil-refining plant]. 
  The output of petroleum products used in automotive 
transportation and agriculture declined as compared to the 
corresponding period of last year. Production of diesel fuel 
fell by one-quarter or more at 11 out of 18 oil refining 
associations and plants of the Rosneft state enterprise, 
including the Saratov NPZ--by 71 percent, Khabarovsk NPZ--by 34 
percent, and Ryazan NPZ--by 29 percent. The greatest drop in 
production of automotive gasoline was registered at the Saratov 
NPZ (74 percent) and Khabarovsk NPZ (45 percent). Production of 
diesel oil declined in Russia as a whole by 60 percent, and 
automotive oil--by half. The output of kerosene for technical 
uses (tractors) declined as compared by January-March of last 
year by 38,000 tonnes (81 percent) [figures as published], and 
at the Saratov NPZ--by 40,000 tonnes (10-fold). 
  The decline in petroleum products production is associated 
to 
a considerable extent with nonpayments. As of 1 March this year 
the total accounts receivable owed to oil refining industry 
enterprises amounted to R3.5 trillion. Sector enterprises, in 
turn, owe R4.2 trillion their suppliers, banks, and so on. 
  Because of a decline in solvent demand, unsold finished 
products are accumulating at oil refining enterprises. As of 1 
April this year saleable remainders of technical-use kerosene 
exceeded by a factor of 3.7 the volume of March output; those of 
motor oil amounted to 52 percent of March output, of household 
furnace oil--35 percent, and automotive gasoline--26 percent. 
  In the first quarter of this year there was a decline in the 
volume of crude oil refining by fractionation processes: thermal 
cracking--by 21 percent, and coking of heavy oil residue--by 37 
percent. At the same time the volume of refining by way of 
hydrocracking increased 9 percent. Overall the share of 
fractionation technologies in the total volume of oil processing 
declined from 10 percent in the first quarter of last year to 
9.4 percent in the first quarter of this year, and the depth of 
crude oil refining--from 60.5 percent to 58.2 percent.

  Russian fuel is mainly exported to Ukraine, which accounts 
for 37-55 percent of all automotive gasoline, oil, and boiler 
oil shipped to CIS countries, and 70-80 percent of gas and 
diesel fuel; to Belarus--17-32 percent of coal, gas, boiler 
fuel, and oil; and Kazakhstan--16-22 percent of oil and coal. In 
January-March this year exports to these countries amounted to:

  The lag in the shipments of a number of categories of fuel 
mainly results from the fact that Commonwealth countries owe 
unpaid amounts to Russia. For this reason 2 percent of 
automotive gasoline quantities envisaged for the quarter was 
exported to Kazakhstan, 5 percent of diesel fuel, 14 percent of 
boiler oil, and 38 percent of oil. 
  Reciprocal shipments of fuel to Russia over the elapsed 
months of this year came only from Kazakhstan. Over 
January-March of this year it shipped 1.3 million tonnes of oil 
to the Russian market (39 percent of last year's level) and 5.9 
million tonnes of coal (71 percent). 
<H5>  Stock Exchange Activities in 1993 </H5>
  By the end of last year there were 72 stock and funds 
exchanges and exchange stock departments; of them, for all 
practical purposes, 26 stock and funds exchanges and 36 exchange 
stock departments were operating in the fourth quarter. 
  The main indicators of operations with exchange assets on 
the 
stock and funds exchange market in Russia in 1993 are shown in 
the table:

  By the end of 1993 the bulk of operating stock and funds 
exchange and exchange stock departments were located in the 
Central and Volga regions--12 exchanges in each; six were 
located in the North Caucasus, eight--in the Urals, seven--in 
Siberia and the Far East, eight--in the Northern and 
Northwestern regions, and eight exchanges--in the Volgo-Vyatka 
and Central Chernozem regions. 
  Central region exchanges (mainly in Moscow) accounted for 93 
percent of the total volume of exchange assets sold on the stock 
and funds market exchanges in Russia, including 81 percent of 
the value of securities, 97 percent of the value of the money 
funds placement, and 90 percent of the value of foreign currency 
in ruble equivalent. Exchanges in the Northwestern regions 
handled 4 percent of the total volume of exchange assets, in the 
Urals region--2 percent, and exchanges in the remaining 
regions--only 1 percent. 
  The scale of exchange activities in operations with exchange 
assets in 1993 by region of Russia was characterized by the 
following data:

  In number of deals concluded and volume of exchange assets 
sold, stock and funds exchanges hold a dominant position in the 
exchange assets market. They handle the sales and placement of 
91 percent of the total volume of exchange assets, including 68 
percent of the value of securities, 99.7 percent of the value of 
money funds, and 100 percent of the value of foreign currency in 
ruble equivalent. 
  Overall in 1993, 2,192.3 billion worth of exchange assets 
were offered for sale, and R2,046.5 billion sold, that is, the 
liquidity (convertibility of exchange assets into money) 
measured 93 percent. 
  Operations with money funds continued to account for the 
bulk 
of operations in exchange trading (70.6 percent of the total 
volume of exchange assets sold), and operations with securities 
were second in significance (29.1 percent). Operations with 
foreign currency were of lesser significance for stock exchange 
activities (0.3 percent). 
  Over nine months of 1993 the volume of exchange assets sold 
continued to increase, mainly due to increases in the volume of 
money funds placed through the market. In the last quarter of 
the year the situation changed in connection with the suspension 
of operations with short-term interbank credits held by the 
Cashier Union at the Russian International Foreign Currency and 
Stock Exchange. This resulted in a reduction of operations with 
money funds from R1,240.2 billion in the third quarter to R26.9 
billion in the fourth quarter; the total volume of exchange 
assets sold decreased correspondingly. 
  The most popular form of money funds were interbank credits 
(IBC). Their proportional share in all money funds placed 
through the exchange stock and funds market in 1993 amounted to 
98.9 percent. Among other money funds are commercial credits, 
and institutional and private deposits; they accounted for 1.1 
percent of total value of money funds. 
  The liquidity of money funds throughout 1993 remained high 
(99.4 percent), including 99.5 percent for IBC, 94.6 percent for 
deposits, and 70.9 percent for commercial credits. Liquidity of 
private deposits is rather low--0.6 percent. 
  Because of continuing inflation, placement of money funds at 
exchanges is short term. 
  Over 1993 the bulk of deposits placed through the exchange 
stock and funds market were available for a period of up to 
three months. The structure of deposits by period of use was 
characterized by the following data (in % of total):

  Continuously increasing demand for credit ensured an 
increase 
in demand for untied money funds, which included deposits of 
both enterprises and individuals. Over 1993 there was a marked 
trend toward a stable increase in average interest paid on 
deposits. The highest interest rates were paid on deposits 
placed for a period of two to three months. 
  The "cheapest" deposits were available at the exchanges in 
the East-Siberian and Central regions, where on average interest 
rates in December amounted to 115 percent and 170 percent, 
respectively. The most "expensive" deposits were found in the 
West-Siberian region--216 percent (minimum rate 185 percent and 
maximum--240 percent). 
  Bank of Russia rates on centralized credits given to 
commercial banks were raised eight times over 1993--from 80 
percent to 210 percent. 
  Average interest rates on interbank and commercial credits 
in 
December were lowest at Central region exchanges (mostly in the 
city of Moscow) and were equal to the Bank of Russia refinancing 
rate (210 percent), which is due to a high concentration of 
banking capital in the region. The highest average interest 
rates were noted in the West-Siberian region--251 percent 
(minimum rate 154 percent, maximum--280 percent). The demand for 
credit for a period of three months decreased in December of 
last year, and average rates declined to 180 percent. 
  The spread (margin) in interest rates between credit and 
deposit money funds available for a period of one and two months 
declined considerably by the end of the year and amounted, 
respectively, to 9 and 16 points as compared to 22 and 33 points 
in September. 
  In 1993, 53.7 billion securities were sold on the exchange 
stock market for a total amount of R595.1 billion. Operations 
with securities accounted for 89 percent of the total number of 
operations with exchange assets. Liquidity of operations with 
them measured 81.6 percent. The most prominent phenomenon in 
securities trading was active buying and selling of short-term 
state bonds (GKO) and privatization vouchers. These state 
securities accounted for 93 percent of the value of all 
securities sold; stocks of production companies, exchanges, 
banks, and investment institutions accounted for only 6.3 
percent, and financial options, futures, bills of exchange, and 
others--for 0.7 percent. 
  In connection with the Government of Russia's policy of 
gradual cutbacks in the volume of the Bank of Russia's 
centralized credits for the purpose of financing the republic 
budget deficit and increasing noninflationary sources of 
covering the deficit, in 1993 the Russian Ministry of Finance 
began to issue short-term state bonds for a period of three and 
six months. Their proportional share in the total value of 
securities sold amounted in 1993 to 47.6 percent. They were sold 
on the Moscow Interbank Foreign Currency Exchange [MMVB]. During 
the first placement of short-term state bonds their liquidity 
ranged from 41.1 percent to 99.9 percent. The profitability of 
issues by weighted average price fluctuated within a range of 
103-176 percent; for six-month bonds it was 181 percent. High 
profitability made these securities attractive for investors. 
  The development of the privatization process was reflected 
in 
privatization voucher trading. The proportion of the value of 
privatization vouchers in the value of securities sold in 1993 
on the stock exchange market amounted to 45.4 percent, and on 
exchanges in the Central Chernozem region--93.6 percent, 
Kaliningrad Oblast--99 percent, and the North Caucasus and 
West-Siberian regions--78.2 percent each. 
  The liquidity of operations with privatization vouchers 
remained quite high--91.4 percent. In 1993 the value of 
privatization vouchers kept growing. The average price of the 
voucher in the first quarter amounted to R4,800 in Russia as a 
whole; in the second quarter--R6,100, third quarter--R9,700, and 
fourth quarter--R18,700. In December it was selling on Moscow 
exchanges for R22,000. 
  Stocks comprised the bulk of trading in nonstate securities. 
The proportion of stocks in the value of securities sold in 1993 
on the stock exchange market amounted to 6.3 percent in Russia 
as a whole; on East-Siberian exchanges it accounted for 86.2 
percent, on Far-Eastern exchanges--93 percent. Most of the time 
the stock offered for trading was common stock. Its share in the 
value of all stocks sold reached 95.7 percent by the end of the 
year; the share of preferred stocks declined over 1993 from 35.3 
percent to 4.3 percent. In a number of regions--the Northern, 
Volga-Vyatka, and Central Chernozem regions and Kaliningrad 
Oblast--preferred stock was not traded; in the Volga, North 
Caucasus, and East Siberian regions their share was extremely 
small. In the Far-Eastern region overall in 1993 their share in 
the value of all stocks sold comprised 42 percent. Liquidity of 
stock operations measured 29.5 percent. 
  The predominant kind of stocks were shares with low nominal 
value (from R1,000 to R10,000), which accounted for 72.3 percent 
of the value of all stock sold; shares with a nominal value of 
up to R1,000 accounted for 26.3 percent (in the beginning of 
1993--50 percent and 37 percent, respectively). 
  In the second quarter there was an increase in sales of 
stocks of enterprises undergoing privatization, and the share of 
stocks of production companies and enterprises in the total 
value of stocks sold increased from 51 percent in January-March 
to 80 percent in January-June 1993. With the activization of 
voucher investment funds operations there was a perceptible 
increase in the share of sales of stocks issued by investment 
institutions. While in January-March it was 2.6 percent, and in 
January-June--2.1 percent, in January-September it was already 
54.7 percent. By the end of 1993 the proportion of stocks issued 
by production companies and enterprises and investment 
institutions and sold through the stock exchange was almost 
equal and comprised, respectively, 47.7 percent and 48.3 percent 
of the total value of shares sold. Bank stocks comprised 3.3 
percent and exchange stocks--0.7 percent. 
  Among other securities that were available for sale in 1993 
but did not receive widespread acceptance were bonds of 
joint-stock companies, enterprises, and organizations; 
certificates of deposit and savings certificates; bills of 
exchange; financial options and futures; and others. The volume 
of trading in them is extremely small. They account for only 0.7 
percent of the value of securities sold. Most popular among them 
were savings certificates, bills of exchange, options and 
futures--their liquidity in 1993 measured between 61 percent and 
97 percent. Certificates of deposit and bonds issued by 
joint-stock companies were noted by their low liquidity--2 
percent. 
  Foreign currency operations played an insignificant role in 
the activities of stock and funds exchanges (their proportional 
share in the total volume of exchange assets sold comprised 0.3 
percent). The bulk of foreign currency is sold on foreign 
currency exchanges, which are issued licenses by the Central 
Bank of the Russian Federation for the right to conduct foreign 
currency operations. 
  The Bank of Russia in 1993 took steps in the direction of 
increasing the network of regional exchanges through which 
foreign currency subject to compulsory sales was realized. By 
the end of the first half-year their number reached six, and in 
the beginning of 1994--seven. All of this contributed to 
decentralization of foreign currency received and redistributed. 
The MMVB continues to hold the leading place in terms of volume 
of operations with foreign currency. 
  Since June 1993 the MMVB has introduced more frequent 
trading 
with the purpose of meeting demand to the maximum extent 
possible, which increased the volume of sales of dollars. 
Distribution of the volume of sales and demand and supply over 
the year is presented in the table ($ billion):

  In 1994 in the state securities market there will be an 
increase in the sales of GKO and gold certificates; 
privatization vouchers will be taken out of circulation. In 
March of this year the Government of Moscow imposed a tax on 
exchange operations involving foreign currency, which resulted 
in a decrease in the volume of foreign currency trading at the 
MMVB.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Frenkel, doctor of economic sciences, under </F>
the rubric "Forecast": "Russia's Industry in May"] 
  [Text] The year 1994 saw the most profound decline in 
production in industry in the postwar era. According to 
analysis, cuts in the output of industrial production for the 
first four months of 1994 should come to 26 percent. In May, the 
situation will not change: the decline in production is going to 
continue. Dropping especially sharply will be the output of 
production in most branches of the machinebuilding complex (in 
many cases by 50-60 percent), the timber, woodworking, and 
cellulose-paper industry (by 30-40 percent), the production of 
building materials (by 30-40 percent), the output of complex 
household technology (by 40-50 percent), and light industry (by 
25-50 percent). The least significant cut will occur in the 
branches of the heating and energy complex (by 5-6 percent, 
except for oil production). A production decline will be 
observed for more than 90 percent of the types of production put 
out. 
  The index of the physical volume of industrial production 
output in May for Russia as a whole will be 0.721, i.e., the 
decline in production in comparison with May 1993 will reach 
27.9 percent. The number of worker days in May 1994 will be 1 
more than in 1993--19. The average daily volume of output of 
industrial production will decrease in May by 29.7 percent. 
  To a significant extent, the drop in production in the first 
quarter took on a structural character. Production output was 
basically determined by solvent demand, which depended almost 
entirely on the financial status of the enterprises. That 
status, which has continued to deteriorate due to the ongoing 
payments crisis, has been conditioned by the production glut, 
prolonged halts in production, social tension that arose as a 
consequence of delayed payment of salaries to workers, etc. 
Thus, according to data from Russia's Goskomstat [State 
Committee for Statistics], as of 1 March 1994, overdue 
indebtedness to suppliers on the part of purchasers totaled 
14,049 billion rubles [R], having increased in one month by 27.8 
percent. In May, overdue indebtedness will increase once again. 
Overdue indebtedness for the payment of funds for wages and 
other monetary payments to workers in the enterprises and 
organizations of industry increased in March by R266.9 billion 
(25.6 percent) and as of 1 April had reached R1311.1 billion. In 
May, this indebtedness is unlikely to decrease. 
  The drop in production in the branches of the heating and 
energy complex as a whole will be insignificant; moreover, in 
many ways it can be explained by the influence of the seasonal 
factor. The manufacture of electric power in May will decrease 
overall by 0.3 percent and will reach 66.4 billion kilowatts 
(kw) per hour. The decline in production will be conditioned by 
manufacturing cutbacks on the part of atomic energy power plant 
by 14 percent and hydroelectric power plants by 4 percent. At 
the same time, the production of electric power at thermal 
electrical power plants will increase by 4 percent. 
  The situation in the coal industry will remain complicated. 
In May 1994, coal mining will drop in comparison with 1993 by 
1.4 million tonnes (6 percent) and will reach 23.7 million 
tonnes; the mining of coal for coke 4.5 million tonnes (83 
percent). 
  Gas production will increase for May by 3 percent and come 
to 
53.2 billion cubic meters. The relatively prosperous state of 
affairs in this branch is connected, on the one hand, with the 
significant gas reserves in deposits being exploited and, on the 
other, with the increase in gas exports. 
  The coal mining industry finds itself in the most difficult 
situation. Use of the oil well exploitation fund has 
deteriorated. The proportion of nonactive wells in the total 
exploitation fund increased from 15 percent in December 1993 to 
18.5 percent in March 1994. In the first quarter of 1994, 
serious difficulties arose for oil-producing enterprises with 
respect to the sale of crude oil to oil refineries, which led to 
a partial halt in production or even a complete halt for more 
than 14,000 oil wells. According to analysis, for this reason 
the cuts in oil production in the first quarter amounted to 
about 4.5 million tonnes, or 34 percent of the total decline in 
production. 
  Oil production in May will drop in comparison with 1993 by 5 
million tonnes (17 percent) and will be 24.1 million tonnes. The 
decrease in oil production and the cut in purchases of it by 
oil-refining enterprises is causing a lowering of its primary 
processing by 18 percent, which in turn will lead to a decline 
in the production of gasoline by 11 percent, diesel fuel by 18 
percent, and furnace fuel oil by 17 percent. 
  The well-established trend of dropping production in ferrous 
metallurgy will not change in May. The basic reason for the 
invariability of this trend is the decline in solvent demand for 
most types of metallurgical output. A complicated situation is 
taking shape around providing the branch with raw materials and 
fuel. The mining of iron ore in May will be cut by 9 percent. 
  In machinebuilding in May the decline in total production 
will strengthen and exceed 50 percent. There will be cuts in 
production output for 93-95 percent of the types of output 
included in the periodic statistical accounts. For nearly half 
of them, the decline in production will exceed 60 percent. As 
before, the branch is in an extremely difficult financial 
situation: as of 1 March the overdue indebtedness of purchasers 
for machinebuilding output acquired totaled R2,517 billion, 
having increased in one month by 10 percent. The chief influence 
on the cuts in production in the branch is the decrease in 
purchasers' solvent demand. 
  On the brink of a complete halt are enterprises in 
agricultural machinebuilding. In the first quarter, tractor 
output amounted to all of 18 percent of the 1993 level, 16 
percent for tractor trailers, and 4 percent for grain-harvesting 
combines, primarily due to a lack of solvent demand. As a 
result, tractor output will come to only 12 percent of the 1993 
level, 3 percent for tractor trailers, and 4 percent for 
grain-harvesting combines. 
  The situation will not improve in transportation 
machinebuilding. The output of long-range diesel locomotives 
will be cut by 50 percent, long-range electric locomotives by 40 
percent, long-range freight cars by 73 percent, long-range 
passenger cars by 28 percent, and trolley-buses by 44 percent. 
  The short-sighted price policy of automotive construction 
enterprises led to a sharp drop in demand for domestic-made 
automobiles. As a result, since December 1993, there has been a 
monthly drop in the output of passenger cars. Nor will May be an 
exception, when their output will drop in comparison with May 
1993 by 11 percent. The output of buses will drop by 3 percent. 
  A significant cutback in production output is expected for 
machine-tools (by 45 percent), forging-pressing machines (67 
percent), spinning machines (52 percent), looms (80 percent), 
bulldozers (63 percent), excavators (37 percent), and roller 
bearings (36 percent). 
  In the chemical and petrochemical industry the drop in 
production will continue in May. Enterprises' financial 
situation will deteriorate. As of 1 March 1994, the overdue 
indebtedness of purchasers of chemical and petrochemical 
production totaled R1,962 billion, having increased in one month 
by 29 percent. In May the growth in indebtedness is unlikely to 
decrease. 
  In the timber, woodworking, and cellulose-paper industry the 
drop in production will continue in May. Equipment in the branch 
is extremely worn out, and a shortage of manpower is observed in 
timber cutting. Meanwhile, the available raw material and 
productive potential is being used inefficiently. The load on 
production capacities does not exceed 35-40 percent, and in 
connection the equipment at most enterprises stands idle as much 
as 60-70 percent of working hours. Like other branches of 
industry, this branch finds itself in a difficult financial 
situation: as of 1 March 1994, overdue indebtedness of 
purchasers totaled R547 billion, having increased in one month 
by 15.4 percent. 
  In the building materials industry no revival is forecast in 
May. As in the previous months of 1994, solvent demand will 
continue to decrease for many types of output of the branch. As 
a result, cement production will drop by 37 percent, asbestos 
cement by 61 percent, asbestos cement pipes and couplings by 17 
percent, building brick by 29 percent, prefabricated reinforced 
concrete by 33 percent, soft roofing materials by 50 percent, 
and window glass by 46 percent. 
  In forecasting volumes of output of complex household 
technology, it is essential to bear in mind that toward the end 
of 1993, on one hand, there was market saturation by 
domestic-made goods put out and, on the other, a rapprochement 
between prices for them and the prices for higher quality 
imported goods. This led to a drop in demand for domestic-made 
household technology in 1994, which caused a sharp decline in 
production. Thus, the output of refrigerators and freezers will 
drop in May by 21 percent, washing machines by 40 percent, 
vacuum cleaners by 54 percent, tape recorders by 64 percent, 
radios by 58 percent, televisions by 25 percent, sewing machines 
by 64 percent, and bicycles by 70 percent. 
  The output of detergents will decline by 51 percent. 
  In May for the first time in the last half-year, there will 
be a drop in the output of cotton fabric by 26 percent. This 
will be connected with the fact that many enterprises in the 
cotton branch have processed almost all the reserves of cotton 
fiber that had been held in reserve in the country and for which 
no payment had been made. As a result, cotton suppliers have 
halted their supply to most enterprises.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Viktorov: "The Authorities Have Decided </F>
What Small Entrepreneurs Need"] 
  [Text] A special federal program is devoted to state 
support of small business in Russia. It has been approved by the 
decree "On Measures Regarding State Support of Small 
Entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation for 1994-1995," which 
was officially distributed yesterday. Such steps are in full 
accord with the fashionable trend of world economic policy; 
however, they can hardly yield a real economic effect. 
  The singularity of Russian economic policy is that the 
authorities are simply compelled to regularly demonstrate 
attention to the problems of small business. The reason for this 
is that in the Russian social consciousness the economic reforms 
have been associated for a rather long time already with the 
support by the state of small private enterprises and 
cooperatives in the struggle against the large state enteprises 
which have monopolized the markets. Still more important is the 
fact that such a stereotype exists also among Western creditors 
and international financial organizations, which traditionally 
require from the Russian authorities precisely the support of 
small private enterprise--as evidence of adherence to the course 
of the reforms. This is to be explained by the fact that now in 
the industrially developed countries (especially in the USA) 
state support of small business has become a fashionable trend 
of economic policy. Western officials want in this way to 
demonstrate their concern about increasing the competitiveness 
of national products on world markets. It is considered that 
precisely small business now moves scientific and technical 
progress. The paradox, it is true, is that the need for state 
support of small business is not at all incontrovertible. In the 
Western countries a large number of small firms prosper not 
thanks to but frequently in spite of the authorities (a vivid 
example in this respect is Italy, where small business has 
occupied a predominant position in the economy as a consequence 
of the population's mistrust of the state). 
  However, the Russian authorities don't go into discussions 
about the effectiveness of state support of small business. A 
Fund for the Support of Entrepreneurship and the Development of 
Competition under the Russian Federation State Committee for 
Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic Structures was 
formed as far back as April of last year and a wide-ranging 
decree "On Top-Priority Measures for the Development and State 
Support of Small Entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation" was 
adopted in May. And, finally, now with the adoption of a Federal 
Program of state support for small entrepreneurship for 
1994-1995, this help has acquired as formalized a form as 
possible. 
  True, the measures envisaged by the program are rather 
vague. 
Basically it is the development on order of all the same stock 
of drafts of legislative acts concerning privileges for small 
entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, it is not to be ruled out that, 
thanks to the program, individual entrepreneurs will be able to 
obtain preferential loans this year. Moreover, the chances for 
this are higher among the representatives of the regions (the 
program declares the fund's intention to give credit support to 
the entrepreneurs of Murmansk, Novgorod, Pskov, Tula and Nizhniy 
Novgorod (Nizhegorodskaya) oblasts). However, unbiased analysis 
indicates that in any case realistic prospects for the 
development of small business in Russia is rather connected not 
with the strengthening of state support but, on the contrary, 
with the weakening of state control over the economy. 
<H5>  Financing of the Federal Program for State Support of Small </H5>
Entrepreneurship in 1994-1995 (bill. rubles in 1993 prices)

<H5>  Basic Measures for the Support of Small Business Envisaged </H5>
by the Program 

  -  Preparation of a draft law "On State Support of Small 
Non-State Enterprises in the Russian Federation" (state support 
will be enjoyed by enterprises operating in priority areas--the 
production and processing of agricultural products; the output 
of foodstuffs, consumer goods, medicines and medical equipment; 
the rendering of consumer services; housing construction; 
activity relating to innovation) 
  -  Preferential extension of credit and state guarantees for 
loans 
to small business (in individual cases--charge-free financing) 
  -  The granting of privileges and preferences to banks, 
investment 
and insurance companies which serve small business 
  -  Exemption of small enterprises from the obligatory sale of 
export foreign currency earnings

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Bagrov: "Taxation of Election Campaigns: </F>
Election Financing Exempt from Taxes"] 
  [Text] In a second reading yesterday the State Duma 
adopted the draft law "On Making Changes and Additions to 
Individual Laws of the Russian Federation on Taxes and on the 
Establishment of Benefits for Compulsory Payments to Off-Budget 
Funds." The document--although this is not reflected in the 
title in any way--discusses regulation of the taxation of 
election campaigns. The deputies preferred the submission of 
changes to existing laws to that of a draft new law especially 
devoted to features of taxation of election campaigns, which was 
developed and submitted to parliament by the federal 
government. 
  It is necessary to give due credit to the Russian 
parliamentarians: They were up to the mark, demonstrating that 
they had a better knowledge of legal norms than the government. 
As early as 1992 the Supreme Soviet adopted a resolution that is 
in effect now in accordance with which any tax benefits go into 
effect only in the event they are stipulated by law on the 
pertinent tax. According to this logic, the parliamentarians 
were absolutely right in declining the government's proposed 
draft law "On Certain Aspects of Taxation in the Conduct of 
Election Campaigns in the Russian Federation." The very same 
questions--taxes on resources paid into the election funds of 
candidates for representatives at various levels of legislative 
and executive authority--are resolved in the parliamentary 
version owing to the submission of changes to taxation 
legislation in effect. The corresponding draft law, which 
received the support of the State Duma, was introduced by Sergey 
Shulgin, a deputy from the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord] faction and a member of the Committee on the Budget, 
Taxes, Banks, and Finances (before his election to the Duma he 
was president of Arkhangelsk's Gandvikbank). 
  Differing with the government on what kind of laws should 
regulate the imposition of taxes on election campaigns, the 
State Duma was in complete agreement with it on the volume and 
addressees of those receiving tax privileges. The action of 
these privileges is being applied to "relations that arose since 
1 January 1994," and any subsequent elections will be conducted 
according to the new rules. 
  Official justification for the tax privileges is reduced to 
the following. The exemption from taxes of the property of 
election commissions and associations, as well as the 
establishment of privileged taxation of donations of juridical 
and physical persons, is occasioned by the fact that these 
resources are used for noncommercial purposes. On the other 
hand, the privileges free the budget from a significant part of 
election costs, including payment for the work of bookkeepers 
and finance inspectors. 
  Formally, this is how it is. But the "noncommercial" 
character of investments in one or another deputy of the State 
Duma, or the mayor of a large city is highly conditional, as 
indicated, for example, by experience in the United States. 
There certainly will be no difficulty in getting around the 
established "donation" limits. In any case, a legislative base 
is being established for the emergence in Russia of funds to 
support one or another candidate or political movement and the 
more active participation of big business in the "affairs of 
politicians," at both the local and federal level. The question 
is whether big business itself will realize this.

<F P=106> [Statement by Academician Abel Aganbegyan recorded by </F>
Nadezhda Ilyinskaya: "Academician Abel Aganbegyan: The Way Out 
of the Crisis Lies Through the Growth of Investment"] 
  [Text] Beginning in the middle of 1993, a new 
condition started in the economy of our country. Before that 
time, it was possible to influence the rate of decline in 
production with the help of monetary infusions, whereas from the 
middle of 1993 on, the fall in the volume of production 
deteriorated and measures to provide monetary grants for 
production almost failed to influence its dynamics. 
  This was manifested in a particularly pronounced form at the 
end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994. Between October and 
December 1993, the rate of inflation was reduced from 23 to 13 
percent, but this did not influence the dynamics of production 
in any way. In January of this year, the rate of inflation 
soared to 23 percent again due to the payments made at the end 
of last year. It would appear that this should have given an 
incentive to producers; besides, consumers also got extra money. 
However, contrary to all projections, the volume of industrial 
production suddenly fell by 25 percent (compared to January 
1992)--a magnitude without parallel to date. In February, the 
rate of inflation fell to 13 percent, and in March to as low as 
8 percent, but the fall in production remained the way it was in 
January. On the whole, the decline in the first quarter came to 
24 percent. In the opinion of many experts, we have 
entered a new depressed stage of the economic crisis whereby 
there already is little dependence between the financial policy 
of the state and the continuing slump in production. Many 
people agree that at present it is impossible to stop the drop 
until the volume of the production hits the bottom of the crisis 
which is expected by the end of this year. In the process, the 
volume of production at this lowest point will come to 
approximately 40 percent of the 1990 volume. 
<H5>  What Is To Be Done </H5>
  As the experience of the world indicates, it will primarily 
be investment that will ultimately help to overcome the crisis 
in the economy. Suppressing inflation is the main prerequisite 
for a transition to investment activity. The program of 
government plans to reduce the monthly rate of inflation to 7-9 
percent by the end of the year. In his message, President Boris 
Yeltsin referred to an even lower percentage rate of 
inflation--5-7 percent. As the experience of the first quarter 
and April indicates, this is a realistic task. 
  Following the lowering of the inflation rate, interest rates 
charged by banks will begin to fall. This has already been 
announced by the Central Bank of Russia by way of planning major 
reductions in interest rates on credit. Lower inflation and 
interest rates and the stabilization of the exchange rate of the 
ruble and the dollar which is associated with this will provide 
incentives for saving. Lower interest rates on capital will 
lengthen the period of credit extension. In this manner, the 
conditions will first of all improve for medium-term investment, 
especially foreign-exchange investment. The demand for producer 
goods will begin to grow which will gradually pull along other 
sectors of the economy. This process could be accelerated if 
more favorable conditions for the attraction of foreign capital 
were created. 
<H5>  Money Is Available All Right.... </H5>
  In essence, the existing severe crisis of production is 
primarily a demand crisis. The manufacturing of individual 
products is dropping because there is no demand for them. When 
production falls the specific cost of production increases thus 
hindering price reductions which could stimulate demand. 
Characteristically, lower demand is not at all firmly associated 
with a lack of monetary funds. By now, more than $20 billion has 
been amassed in foreign-exchange accounts in Russia; another 
approximately $18 billion (according to realistic estimates) is 
being kept by Russian citizens and organizations at foreign 
banks. Every day, R0.7-1.0 trillion is produced at currency 
trading sessions to be exchanged into Marks or dollars. The 
activity of the population in acquiring various shares, 
securities, and so on is known. Money is available but, as is 
the case in all market economies, an overwhelming proportion of 
it is concentrated in the possession of the population. 
Meanwhile, our economy which was formed during the era of a 
totalitarian state and centralized planning is primarily geared 
toward meeting the needs of the military-industrial complex and 
heavy industry, and to a lesser degree toward meeting the 
requirements of consumers. Hence the structural crisis and a 
particularly sharp decline in the output of the 
military-industrial complex and heavy industry which used to 
thrive on orders and the sectors stimulated through state 
subsidies (such as tractor and farm machinery building). 
  A peculiar situation has emerged: The population (more 
precisely, its affluent segment), as well as some of the 
enterprises and organizations, have money, but they are not 
inclined to spend it to acquire domestic goods of inferior 
quality, and at high prices, to boot. It is also difficult to 
purchase imported goods because of high duties on imports, and 
consumers are waiting for better times to come. 
  As has already been said, both the reduction in the rate of 
inflation which has begun and the hardening of the macroeconomic 
policy proclaimed by the government create favorable conditions 
for overcoming the crisis through a rise in investment. 
<H5>  Who Is Threatened With Bankruptcy? </H5>
  At the same time, we should be aware of the fact that lower 
inflation will cause the bankruptcy of: 
  a) many banks, which will be unable to recover the credit 
extended due to the insolvency of the enterprises and 
organizations using credit which hoped to make money by selling 
goods at high prices in the inflationary environment. It is 
estimated that more than one-half of the existing banks may pass 
from the stage, and both organizations and the population that 
have deposited money at these banks will suffer losses. The 
above also applies to investment funds and various credit and 
finance institutions. This process has already begun, and it 
will mount rapidly; 
  b) many intermediate commercial structures engaging in 
speculative operations on the basis of the inflationary growth 
of prices will also go bankrupt. Almost all small companies 
which profiteered by selling sugar have already disappeared 
because the wholesale price of sugar in Russia is decreasing. 
Regular trade in it has become unprofitable; 
  c) many enterprises will go bankrupt whose products are not 
in demand at the prices set by these enterprises, prices that 
are due to high production outlays (the latter is associated 
with the inefficiency of production). Bankruptcy does not 
necessarily mean the liquidation of a given enterprise; the 
enterprise may be placed under a larger commercial structure 
which will assume the debts and in the future may organize more 
effective production at the facilities of the enterprise. 
<H5>  To Survive Intelligently </H5>
  Of course, a majority of the enterprises will survive during 
this, perhaps the most difficult time of the period of 
transition to a market economy. However, they will be able to 
survive solely by reducing the cost of production because it 
will be impossible to pass on their excessive costs to the 
consumer in the environment of a sales crisis. Reducing the 
strength, spinning off the ineffective sections of enterprises, 
and switching to strict austerity measures in all areas are the 
easiest paths toward cost reductions. 
  The growth of unemployment will come as a result of this 
process which is unfolding before our eyes and which will 
intensify. At present, registered unemployed in Russia account 
for approximately 1 percent of labor force. By using their 
methods for the calculation of the number of unemployed, 
unemployment experts from Western Europe have actually found 
that the unemployed account for 5-6 percent of the labor force, 
including those who work shorter workdays or have been 
furloughed without pay. It is projected that by the end of the 
year this statistic can grow to 7-10 percent which will 
substantially depend on the activities of the state. The state 
may provide incentives for the creation of new jobs, organize 
public works to use the nonworking population, and so on. 
  A social program of assistance to the unemployed has yet to 
be seriously thought through. The existence of mass unemployment 
which is characteristic of countries with market economies is 
the largest social problem, social ill, and plague of society 
which we will have to encounter to the fullest extent shortly. 
  The issue of insolvency of enterprises is inseparably linked 
to all of the above problems. The total indebtedness of 
enterprises has come to about R32 trillion, of which defaulted 
payments come to R16 trillion. The volume of indebtedness comes 
to approximately 10 percent of the gross national product which 
is generally quite significant but not fatal. 
<H5>  There Is No Panacea; a Set of Measures Is Needed </H5>
  As is known, in the second half of 1992 the insolvency of 
enterprises was sharply reduced by way of mutual clearing on one 
hand and the provision of funds on preferential terms to 
replenish the working capital of enterprises on the other. This 
made it possible to reduce total nonpayments from R3.2 trillion 
in the middle of 1992 to R400 billion in the fourth quarter of 
the same year. That is to say, in comparable prices the 
reduction came to a factor of more than 20. Unfortunately, this 
experience taught us nothing; no economic mechanism was worked 
out for the organization of regular payments in the economy. As 
a result, mutual insolvency began to mount gradually in the face 
of government inaction during all of 1993 and the first quarter 
of 1994. The time has now come to take measures because due to 
such indebtedness the payment of wages is delayed and individual 
enterprises shut down, which is fraught with the most serious 
consequences. A single measure, a panacea for all troubles in 
this area hardly exists; a set of measures to fundamentally 
improve the system of payments in the national economy is needed. 
  First, the requirement to pay before the contractual 
deadline 
should be made stricter. At present, many enterprises have funds 
but nonetheless delay payment for the products already received. 
The arbitration mechanism is imperfect, slow, and ineffective in 
this area. In a number of cases, the supplier may not refuse to 
deliver products because this has been ordained by the state 
(for example, the delivery of oil to specific refineries). In 
the process, neither the state nor the consumer himself is 
liable for the timing of the payment, which also needs to be 
corrected. 
  The cycle of nonpayments frequently runs into and is 
sustained by the hopelessly ineffective enterprises which are 
"in debt up to their eyeballs," and there are no prospects in 
view for them. In this case, there is only one way out--to 
declare the enterprises bankrupt and to break the entire 
insolvency cycle. 
  The use of bills of exchange, including those with bank 
guarantees, is one of the possible devices for bringing 
temporary insolvency into regular confines. In this area, the 
initiative of the Tveruniversalbank impresses many people. 
<H5>  Small Business Is a Major Thing </H5>
  The development of small businesses is an important 
condition 
for overcoming the crisis, alleviating unemployment, and raising 
the standard of living of individual groups of the populace. 
Russia is virtually the only country that does not grant 
major preferences for the development of legal small 
businesses. At the same time, small business companies 
enjoy major tax relief and financial and other support from the 
state in countries with developed market economies. For this 
reason, the number of small business companies is usually 
counted in millions (France, Italy, Japan, the United States, 
and others), and the number of their employees exceeds 3 percent 
of the total number of the population. 
  As far as Russia is concerned, about 450 [as published] 
small 
enterprises and organizations have been officially registered 
(0.3 percent of the total population). At the same time, 
hundreds of thousands of other small organizations operate 
illegally and engage in small business through stands and flea 
markets, through the system of customer orders, and so on, 
paying no taxes in the process. The development of small 
businesses will make it possible to substantially increase the 
employment of the population in the environment of looming 
unemployment and also to provide additional income for many 
families. Besides, this is the most dynamic sector of the 
economy, which quickly adapts to changing conditions and, 
consequently, ensures that public needs are met to a fuller 
extent. 
  Large state enterprises, which have been unable to genuinely 
plug into the market and largely continue to manufacture old 
products not sufficiently in demand are facing the most 
difficult situation in the crisis environment. Enterprises that 
have technically been converted to the joint-stock format are 
among such enterprises. At the same time, privately owned 
enterprises and organizations (in our country, they are 
frequently referred to as "commercial structures") survive with 
greater success, and many altogether prosper. In conjunction 
with this, genuine privatization--one of the most important 
prerequisites for starting up the market mechanism and turning 
it into an engine of growth--becomes tremendously important. 
<H5>  Where Is the Genuine Proprietor? </H5>
  An overwhelming proportion of Russian enterprises converted 
to the joint-stock format has actually passed through the first 
stage of such conversion--the private distribution of shares and 
check auctions at which on the average 20 percent of the package 
of shares were sold. Neither the arrangement of private 
subscription nor sales at check auctions have yielded actual 
financial resources which are necessary for the recovery and 
development of the newly created joint-stock enterprises. The 
assembly line of investment tenders that was promised in the 
privatization program has failed to kick in. The number of 
investment tenders is two orders of magnitude smaller than that 
of check auctions. Therefore, an overwhelming majority of 
enterprises that converted to the joint-stock format have not 
been appraised by the market and, consequently, have not found 
their genuine proprietor. Meanwhile, it is precisely finding a 
genuine proprietor that is the essence of privatization. To this 
end, the stock of a given enterprise needs to be appraised by 
the market and sold and bought freely. Such stock will be 
gradually redistributed through the stock market, and a 
considerable proportion of it will end up in the possession of 
individual commercial structures, banks, or groups of persons 
whether or not employed at the enterprise in question. The main 
point is for this proprietor to have a vested financial interest 
in the profitable, gainful operation of the enterprise in 
question, to believe in it, to invest funds, and to facilitate 
its development, i.e. behave as a zealous proprietor would. 
  Actually, the entire post-privatization operation of an 
enterprise will be associated with determining the market price 
of this enterprise, finding a "proprietor"--the main owner, 
restructuring, and possibly changing the output mix of the 
enterprise in question in order to produce more effective 
results. 
  First, attention should be focused on marketing services. In 
the market, the main point is to sell goods rather than produce 
them. Large companies should have proprietary or subsidiary 
commercial organizations or dealers to sell or service products. 
Vertically integrated companies that engage not only in 
producing raw materials but include the entire chain all the way 
to the consumer are the most effective in the market. Oil 
companies whose main business is the processing of oil, 
production of petrochemicals, and in particular their own chains 
of gas stations rather than oil production are a vivid example. 
Compare this to a majority of our oil associations, and their 
ineffectiveness and low profit margins will become easy to 
understand. However, the first embryos of vertically integrated 
companies are also appearing in this lagging sector (Lukoyl, 
YUKAS). 
  Second, the closest possible attention should be paid to the 
development of the financial services of enterprises. In many 
cases, special financial corporations reporting to large 
producers should be established, and industrial enterprises need 
to be transformed into industrial and financial groups. Few 
joint-stock companies actually use their potential for public 
shareholding; meanwhile, joint-stock companies are mostly formed 
to attract additional capital. Some Germes or, worse yet, 
Neftalmazinvest which have virtually no property raise tens and 
at times hundreds of billions of rubles by issuing various 
securities, promising high dividends, and so on, whereas our 
largest oil and diamond-producing enterprises possessing 
enormous property do nothing to this end and go without funds. 
  Third, strong legal services are necessary. 
  Therefore, a fundamental reorientation of the operation of 
enterprises is necessary. It would also be good to eliminate 
from circulation the term "industrial enterprise," and rather 
refer to them as firms, companies, and societies, and establish 
such, meaning by this the entire cycle of operations that 
includes not only production, on which we used be fixated most 
of all in the past, but also commerce and finance. 
  [Begin box] Taxes have altogether smothered 
enterprises, and the 1994 budget is no exception. Once again, 
additional taxes are being introduced, and some of those already 
in existence are being made stricter. Given this tax load, no 
leeway is left for maneuvering. 
  I found the highest tax--92.5 percent--at the 
Surgutneft, the only prosperous association. This is a disaster! 
Clearly, with taxes like this it is impossible to do anything, 
to either drill wells or prospect for oil; nor is there money to 
sustain the social sphere. 
  At present, the government understands that the crisis 
will not be overcome with such taxes. I think that a certain 
lightening of the tax burden will follow soon. [end box]

  The maximum rates of per-capita incomes in the first quarter 
have been recorded in the Far Eastern and Northern economic 
regions--R134,000 and R129,000, and the minimum in the North 
Caucasus--R56,000 and the Central Black Earth economic 
regions--R63,000. At the same time the differentiation of 
economic regions by monetary incomes in the first quarter of 
1994 in comparison with the fourth quarter of 1993 has not 
changed essentially--2.4 and 2.3 times respectively. 
  When comparing the data on per-capita monetary incomes of 
the 
population in January 1994 with the data of January 1993, it is 
necessary first of all to note the overall improvement of the 
situation in the area of the population's incomes during the 
period under consideration. 
  Per-capita monetary incomes have increased 8.8 times in 
Russia during the year. The maximum growth by economic regions 
has been recorded in the North-Western and Central regions--10.1 
and 11.8 times respectively (including in Saint Petersburg--13.8 
and in Moscow--13.5) and the West Siberian region--9.8 times. 
These regions in many respects have assured the overall 
improvement of the situation with the population's incomes in 
Russia as a whole. The growth of incomes has gone the slowest in 
the Central Black Earth (7.5), Urals (7.6), Far Eastern (7.9), 
North Caucasus (7.7) and East Siberian (6.2) regions. 
  The monetary incomes of the population for Russia as a whole 
in dollar terms has increased approximately 3.1 times as against 
8.8 times in rubles. That is, in freely convertible currency 
per-capita monetary incomes grew almost three times slower than 
in rubles. The level of monthly average per-capita monetary 
incomes (API) has amounted to approximately $56 in the first 
quarter of 1994. This is less than in the fourth quarter of 
1993. A quite decent growth--21.2 percent--is obtained when the 
calculations are in rubles. The calculations in freely 
convertible currency indicate another trend--a drop in 
per-capita monetary incomes during the quarter by almost 8 
percent. 
  The rise in the price of the goods needed to achieve a 
minimum living standard continued in the first quarter of 1994. 
For Russia as a whole the monetary value of the minimum 
substince budget (BPM) has amounted to R53,900 and has increased 
more than 1.4 times in comparison with the fourth quarter of 
1993, i.e., the BPM has increased by 12-13 percent each month on 
average. 
  In January 1994 the maximum size of the BPM was registered 
in 
the Far Eastern economic region--R91,100. Based on the level of 
the BPM the Far East, as previously, substantially outstripped 
the East Siberian and Northern regions following after it 
(R60,900 and R57,900). 
  As with a year ago, the lowest value of the BPM has been 
registered in the Volga region--R33,100. 
  In the Russian Federation Ministry of Labor's officially 
approved procedure the BPM is defined as an increment (doschet) 
to the value of the food basket, the relative share of which on 
average per capita is established at the rate of 68.3 percent. 
Taking objective factors into account, in particular the more 
rapid growth of expenditures for services and non-food goods, 
the Living Standard Center proposes the reduction of this 
percentage to 59.3. Taking this adjustment into account, the 
value of the BPM in January 1994 for Russia as a whole will rise 
from R48,000 to R55,300, i.e., by more than 15 percent. 
  The grouping of economic regions as a function of the 
monetary valuation of the BPM also has undergone changes. If in 
January 1993 the differentiation of regions on the basis of the 
size of the BPM came to two times, then in January 1994 it was 
already 2.5 times. Given an equal number of the regions (seven 
in each) in the group with a "low" BPM in January 1993 and in 
January 1994, the share of the population living in these 
regions has increased by almost 10 percent in 1994. The share of 
the population living in regions with an "average" BPM value has 
shrunk by as much--from 30 to 20 percent. 
  The magnitude of the real incomes of the population (RDN), 
expressed in the number of BPM baskets (nabor) in the average 
per-capita income, has amounted to 1.47 baskets in the first 
quarter of 1994 as against 1.17 baskets in January 1993. 
  In January 1994, the maximum RDN values have been registered 
in the West Siberian, Northern and Central economic regions, 
1.76, 1.74, and 1.86 baskets respectively. The minimum RDN 
values have been noted in the North Caucasus, East Siberian and 
Far Eastern regions, 1.09, 1.12, and 1.27 baskets respectively. 
Attention should be paid to the fact that in the East Siberian 
region in January 1994, the RDN level has turned out to be lower 
than the level of the beginning of 1993, 1.12 and 1.45 baskets 
respectively. A very insignificant absolute annual increase of 
the RDN has been recorded both in the Urals region--0.05 
baskets--and in the Far Eastern--0.1 baskets. The maximum RDN 
increase has been observed in the Central region--0.92 baskets, 
taking into account the 1.43 baskets increase in the city of 
Moscow. 
  The RDN situation has become better in the beginning of 1994 
than in the beginning of 1993. This has manifested itself, 
firstly, in the absolute increase in the size of the RDN in all 
economic regions except the East Siberian; secondly, in the 
decrease in the number of regions with a low RDN level. The 
overall number of regions in the group with a "high" RDN level 
has increased in the beginning of 1994. Interregional 
differentiation based on the RDN has increased somewhat. If in 
the beginning of 1993 the coefficient of differentiation based 
on the value of the RDN came to 1.6 times, then in the beginning 
of 1994 it is 1.7 times. 
  Both for Russia as a whole and for the majority of the 
regions (the North Caucasus and East Siberia constitute the 
exception), most of the population possessed per-capita monetary 
incomes in the interval of from one to two BPMs in the fourth 
quarter of 1993. For Russia as a whole the share of such a 
population came to 40 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993. In 
other words, in the majority of regions, irrespective of what 
group it belonged to based on the size of the BPM, there is a 
stable block of the population with incomes above one and up to 
two BPMs. For Russia as a whole the share of the population with 
monetary incomes greater than two BPMs came to 25.5 percent and 
was less than the share of the population with incomes lower 
than one BPM--34.4 percent. 
  An indicator of the differentiation of the monetary incomes 
of Russia's population equal to 11 is often published in the 
press. This is the accepted in statistics decile coefficient of 
differentiation, which is calculated as the relationship of the 
minimal monetary income in the group of the 10 percent of the 
population with the highest income (in the fourth quarter of 
1993 this value equalled R180,000) to the maximum monetary 
income in the group of the 10 percent of the population with the 
smallest monetary income (R19,900). In its estimates of 
differentiation the Living Standard Center uses a relationship 
of the average incomes of these two groups of the population 
(R289,000 and R13,900 respectively), equal to 20.79, which is 
double the officially used estimate. 
  In the fourth quarter of 1993 the average per-capita 
monetary 
income of the three groups of the population--workers and 
employees, pensioners, and the rural population--correlated as 
1.92:1.19:1. 
  The monetary incomes of the rural population are 
characterized by the lowest average level and a high indicator 
of differentiation not only with respect to the families of 
workers and employees but also to pensioners. It should be noted 
that the incomes of kolkhozniks always were characterized by a 
low average level and their relatively higher differentiation in 
comparison with the analogous indicators for workers and 
employees. However, that among the rural population the incomes 
of kolkhozniks have become lower than in the families of 
pensioners is a fact that is completely negative. One should 
also bear in mind that the positive dynamics of average 
per-capital real incomes does not always reflect the changes in 
the real incomes of the various social groups. Thus, the share 
of the population of Russia having an income less than the PLB 
has increased during the past year.

<F P=106> [Article by Ye. Spiridonov, ADS, under the rubric </F>
"Property": "Four Fifths of Machinebuilding Enterprises 
Potential Bankrupts: Roskommash Disputes Insolvency Criteria Set 
by Government"] 
  [Text] In a few days, a government resolution on the 
implementation of bankruptcy legislation that sets insolvency 
criteria for enterprises and regulates standards for 
bankruptcy-related procedures will be passed. In preparing the 
draft resolution, the Federal Administration for Insolvency 
(Bankruptcy) Affairs under Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee 
on the Administration of State Property] used methods for 
analyzing enterprises' financial-economic activity worked out by 
the administration with the participation of specialists from 
Roskommash (Russian Federation Committee on Machinebuilding). 
The Roskommash board of directors was informed of this at a 
meeting by its chairman, Anatoliy Ogurtsov. 
  However, as Aleksandr Voytenko, the head of the Main 
Administration for Structural Policy, Demonopolization, and 
Privatization at Roskommash, stated, while coming into its own 
in the name of the state as the owner of the bankrupt 
enterprise, the department raised the plank of financial 
indicators envisioned as allowable too high. If insolvency 
criteria are to be set only according to the current accounting 
balance-sheet, as the Federal Administration on Insolvency 
Affairs is doing, and the enterprise's debts are allowed to 
exceed the funds available to cover them by no more than a 
factor of 2, then, according to Aleksandr Voytenko, 80 percent 
of the enterprises in the machinebuilding complex will wind up 
on the register of insolvent enterprises. 
  So far, the Federal Administration on Insolvency Affairs has 
put the Moscow Searchlight Plant and the NATI Institute [State 
Tractor Science and Research Institute] on the "black list." 
Roskommash itself is still defined on the basis of 15 
enterprises. At the instruction of Viktor Chernomyrdin, said 
Anatoliy Ogurtsov, the branch commission will analyze 
enterprises' financial-economic status and make site visits 
before 25 May. Then the final list of bankruptcy candidates will 
be drawn up. However, it will include only the "very very most," 
inasmuch as the government's draft resolution on implementing 
bankruptcy legislation, Mr. Ogurtsov feels, permits the 
integrity criteria it sets to be ignored when the bankruptcy of 
the enterprise could be averted by preventive financial 
stabilization measures. 
  Among the prophylactic measures against bankruptcy mentioned 
at the board meeting were mandatory preservation of at least 25 
percent of the shares of the enterprises included in the 
priority branch programs for the development of machinebuilding 
as state property, as well as the transfer of these shares to an 
administration acting as principal for the branch ministries and 
committees. Sergey Belyayev, chairman of the Federal 
Administration on Insolvency Affairs, who spoke at the meeting, 
characterized these claims of Roskommash's as unsupported, 
since, as he said, there had yet to be a single example of an 
enterprise with a 25-percent share of state property being able 
to attract a substantial investor. Therefore, in his opinion, if 
its directors were indeed disturbed by the fate of semi-official 
enterprises, then Roskommash, on the contrary, needs to fight 
for state packages of shares to be sold to rich investors.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yu. A. Yashin, by A. Vaganov, under the </F>
rubric "VPK [Military-Industrial Complex]": "Yuriy Yashin: `The 
State's Opportunities Are Limited': High Technologies in Russia: 
Between Past and Future"] 
  [Text] So it worked out by force of objective 
circumstances that the Soviet, now the Russian, VPK 
[military-industrial complex] was virtually the sole creator 
and, at the same time, producer of high technology in our 
country. What this cost the other branches of the economy is a 
separate discussion. Regardless, today we face the real prospect 
of losing this "accumulator" of the most modern scientific and 
technological experience. If things go any further, the symbol 
of this process could become the spacecraft Burak, which has 
been turned into an attraction at Moscow's Gorky Park. For the 
state, in its present condition, the VPK may well be an 
unbearable burden. Where does the solution to the current 
situation lie? 
  Answering the questions of NG's [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] 
correspondent is Yuriy Alekseyevich Yashin, chairman of the 
State Technical Commission under the RF [Russian Federation] 
president, laureate of the State Prize, doctor of technical 
sciences, professor, academician of the Russian and 
international academies of engineering and of the Russian 
Academy of Astronautics. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Yuriy Alekseyevich, aren't we having a 
conversation merely for conversation's sake? Won't the problems 
of our country's high technology be resolved automatically, as 
the economy stabilizes? 
  [Yashin] First let's define what we mean by "high 
technology." 
  Essentially, what this means is high priority directions for 
applied research and research-intensive production, the mastery 
of which at the present moment is what determines a country's 
degree of development, its real scientific-technical, economic, 
yes, and military weight in the world. 
  In order to have its own high technology, a country must 
possess a minimum of three things: highly qualified staffs of 
researchers and producers; the necessary material base for 
science and industry; and significant funds, which are essential 
at the stage of research and introduction. 
  Allow the temporary absence of just one of these 
conditions--that is, fail to take measures against the "brain 
drain," economize on research and modernization of production, 
or on higher education--during a period of economic difficulties 
and you are saying goodbye to any hope of staying on a world 
level. 
  The whole process is automatic. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But maybe we really should restrict 
our 
ambitions and pretensions in high technology and attempt to 
occupy an acceptable place in the world division of labor, 
relying on less costly spheres of production. 
  [Yashin] That kind of thinking is fundamentally wrong, and 
its implementation could cost our country very dearly in all 
respects, including the purely economic one. 
  Only with the massive application of our country's 
helicopter 
technology (especially the Mi-6 and Mi-8 helicopters) were we 
able to accelerate the opening up of Tyumen oil by 10 years. 
  Up to 30 percent of the information obtained by the Russian 
Defense Ministry's satellites could be used in the interests of 
our agriculture, whereas at present no more than 5 percent is 
being used; 60 percent could be used in the interests of lumber, 
but only 2 percent is. 
  Generally speaking, a lot of high technology is vital to 
Russia. Our transport system would simply collapse without air 
transportation. No other country needs satellite systems for 
communication, ecological monitoring, and resource investiation 
more than ours. 
  Here an extremely important dilemma arises: what do we need 
to develop and support more, our own high technology or purchase 
the appropriate output abroad, create jobs here at home or 
support another country's prosperity, complain of the 
ever-present "price scissors" of resources and manufactured 
output or take our own "place in the sun" on the world market? 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Is the issue really that serious? 
  [Yashin] Unfortunately, yes. Let's look at the situation in 
civil aviation. In the next 5-10 years we are going to have to 
replace the overwhelming portion of our aviation fleet--about 
1100 of our 1400 long-range airplanes. The creation of these 
airplanes is provided for in the current "Program of Development 
for Civil Aviation Technology." The Tu-204, Il-96-300, and other 
airplanes that have already been developed fully meet world 
standards. 
  At the same time, the current financing of the program comes 
to 26-28 percent of what is required, the finishing of vehicles 
and their release into serial production is being delayed, the 
aviation industry, which as a result of the wholesale decline in 
military orders has lost approximately 400,000 jobs, is not 
fully utilized, and one of its leaders, the Aviastar 
association, in order to stay afloat, is already entering into 
an agreement to assemble English airplanes made from English 
parts. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] We see that the problem is 
inexhaustible. Still, precisely what paths for its solution do 
you feel are most important today? 
  [Yashin] Keeping in mind the framework of our interview, I 
will limit myself to what seem to me the three most important 
points. 
  First: optimization of the process of converting defense 
branches of industry. Due to objective reasons, Russia's leading 
scientific-technological potential has turned out to be 
concentrated in the branches of the defense complex. The current 
way of implementing conversion threatens it with "erosion," if 
not loss, and it is essential for us that this potential be 
reoriented toward satisfying the demands of the economy's civil 
sector. Especially since a rational reorientation involves 
direct access to a virtually instantaneous and advantageous 
"open yield" from the defense surplus. For example, right now a 
cooperation of enterprises headed by the Moscow Institute of 
Thermal Technology is building on experience gained in making 
mobile military rocket complexes to design a family of 
commercial, multipurpose, transportable complexes for putting 
lightweight satellites into orbit. Flight tests of the Start-1 
complex have been going on successfully since 25 March 1993. Now 
several long-term programs for utilizing the Start complexes in 
the interests of Russian and foreign organizations have been 
agreed upon. There are other extremely interesting proposals as 
well. 
  Second: a search for new ways to administer 
scientific-technical progress. We must make substantial changes 
in the mechanisms for administering design and research, which 
in large part are inherited from the old economic model and are 
not very effective, given current conditions. 
  Finally, third, and perhaps most important: a solution for 
the problem of investments in our country's high technology. The 
state's opportunities are limited. We must activate all possible 
sources of financing, including commercial structures at home 
and abroad and international consortia. 
  The state should do the minimum essential for this: ensure a 
favorable investment climate; offer a developed legal base 
guaranteeing investor interests; and create capable executive 
organs. So far the operations of the executive and judicial 
authorities in this respect have been poorly coordinated and 
have borne a somewhat impulsive character. One can only express 
one's regret, for instance, that the appearance of the RF 
president's edict of 27 September 1993, No. 1466, "On Completion 
of Work with Foreign Investments," did not stimulate any 
noticeable progress in this sphere. 
  Apart from foreign investments in the country, however, we 
also have our own potential sources of financing for high 
technology and research-intensive branches. In order to get 
things going well, we need to join forces and bring the 
positions of all subjects in the investment process closer 
together: banking structures, enterprises, the state apparatus, 
and authoritative scholars and specialists. 
  I think that a definite positive role in this could be 
played 
by the international conference on "Integration of Banking 
Industrial Capital," which is planned for November of this year 
and the national organizing committee for which is headed up by 
the deputy chairman of the RF government, Aleksandr Shokin. Also 
encouraging is the role being played in conference preparation 
by our own country's financial structures, especially the 
Association of Russian Banks, the Moscow Banking Union, 
Aviabank, and several others.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Petukhov and Andrey Ryabov: "Do Not </F>
Stop Us from Living, Help Us To Survive: About the Social Frame 
of Mind of Russians"] 
  [Text] How do Russians perceive the difficult and 
painful process of reforms? What do they think of their 
immediate prospects? The spectrum of evaluations is very 
broad--from the bravura-optimistic type of "people for reform" 
to predictions of an impending social explosion that border on 
loud demagogy. However, such ideas frequently prove to be far 
from reality. This is indicated, in particular, by the results 
of comprehensive sociological research conducted by Russia's 
Independent Institute of Social and National Problems in 11 
regions of the country. 
  It might appear at first glance that the evaluations of 
Russians coincide with the gloomiest forecasts: 89 percent of 
respondents called the situation alarming, a crisis, and 
catastrophic, while only 5.9 percent called it ordinary. But 
against this background of clearly expressed social discomfort, 
data that reflect people's feelings on a personal level look 
surprising. 
  Every 10th person assessed his own situation as good, 64 
percent as satisfactory, and only 20.2 percent as poor. As for 
personal prospects, here cautious optimism also prevails. A 
little more than half the people are convinced that their life 
will improve, or at worst remain unchanged. 
  What is the reason for such an obvious gap between the 
estimates of the situation in the country and at the personal 
level? Apparently, a majority of Russians do not believe in the 
ability of the authorities to ensure an acceptable level of 
political and economic stability in the country and to guarantee 
both public and personal safety. This conclusion, in particular, 
derives from the answer to the question: "What is the greatest 
danger for Russia today?" Here the picture, in descending order 
of importance, is as follows: the increase in crime, the 
impoverishment of the people, the impotence of the political 
authorities, the growth in unemployment, the worsening of the 
ecological situation, and sliding into civil war. (Incidentally, 
the last indicator was much lower than in previous years--in 
1992 and 1993 it continuously exceeded 50 percent.) That is, it 
is perfectly obvious that Russians are alarmed mostly by 
problems that are being resolved not on a personal level but 
that require the collective, united efforts of society and the 
state. The impetus from below is this: You guarantee the 
external conditions of vital activity, and we will resolve 
problems concerning our personal affairs by ourselves. 
  The conviction that the current crisis condition of society 
is serious and will last a long time has replaced the 
"revolution of expectations." But since this is the case, it 
will be necessary for us to extricate ourselves. People already 
do not want that much from the authorities. To the question: 
"What, in your opinion, should be the role of the state in the 
life of our country?"--a majority of those polled answered that 
the state should ensure all citizens a social minimum 
(inexpensive food products, inexpensive clothing, inexpensive 
housing, a free education, etc.), but anyone who wants more 
should get it by himself. In addition, 63.8 percent of 
respondents expressed the desire personally to engage in 
business undertakings. But the idea of total liberalism, that 
is, that the state should not interfere in the life of the 
citizens and that everyone should depend on himself, was 
supported by only 4.2 percent of those polled; 13 percent think 
that the state should help only the weak and helpless. Somewhat 
more respondents, but also a minority (22.4 percent), are 
convinced of the need to return to an equalization system in 
which the state, according to the idea, should guarantee the 
full equality of all citizens (property, legal, and political). 
  It would seem that the attraction of people to forces of a 
social-democratic nature should correspond to similar values in 
the spirit of the idea of a socially oriented market. However, 
parties of this inclination do not yet enjoy any special 
influence in the country. The reason for this, apparently, is 
that influential parties of such an orientation can form mainly 
on the basis of a powerful national workers and trade union 
movement (as, incidentally, occurred in West Europe) that comes 
out under the flag of the idea of social partnership. But in the 
sphere of economic relations in Russia, the type of hired worker 
with rationalistic-market thinking has not yet developed as a 
mass phenomenon. Under such conditions, the creation of a 
powerful trade union movement that defends the interests of the 
collective hired worker before the employer and of a national 
trade union center is very problematical. 
  But on the whole, the notions of which sociopolitical forces 
are capable of giving the country a better future are 
distinguished by a lack of clarity and fragmentariness. Of the 
respondents, 20.6 percent associate their hopes with democratic 
forces, 18 percent--with the Russian nationalists, and 16.8 
percent are setting their hopes on assistance from the West, 
while 11.5 percent are counting on the Orthodox Church to one 
degree or another. In a certain measure, the broad spectrum of 
political preferences--from universalism and liberalism to 
traditionalism and great power ideas--reflects the state of 
confusion of the mass conscience. However, more than half the 
respondents associate hopes for getting the country out of the 
crisis with social forces of a traditionalist-statehood 
orientation--Russian nationalists, monarchists, the Cossack 
Host, and the Orthodox Church. 
  Thus, the political force that will want to claim the role 
of 
national leader will be compelled to combine in its political 
activity the ideas of a socially oriented market economy and 
traditional national patriotic and state aims. It can be assumed 
that this political force, in order to win popularity, will have 
to actively exploit anti-mafia and anti-nomenklatura slogans. 
  This may be a party or movement of a neo-conservative 
persuasion that adheres to democratic rules and procedures in 
the struggle and is based on the ideas of a socially oriented 
market which recognizes the priority of laws and human freedom 
and simultaneously calls for preservation of the traditions of a 
strong statehood and the Russian spirit and patriotism.

<F P=106> [Interview with A. Malinovskiy by Galina Pokomareva; place </F>
and date not given: "And Again Non-flying Weather"] 
  [Text] "The wages of pilots at the Moscow Bykovo 
Airport range from 300,000 to 500,000 rubles. Pilots in 
Domodedovo and Vnukovo receive more than 1 million. In the 
opinion of the common man, not the most destitute people in the 
country intend to strike," I began the conversation with A. 
Malinovskiy, who a year ago left the post of IL-62 commander in 
Domodedovo in order to head Russia's Trade Union of Flight 
Personnel. 
  "You are an instigator, I guessed right away," Alfred 
Avgustovich reacted. "One should not make extremists out of us. 
We demand not money, but the government's attention to the 
problems of the entire sector. 
  "Only enterprises that have the opportunity to fly abroad 
are 
profitable now. The rest are unprofitable. Aviators in the North 
and the Far East are in the most difficult situation, despite 
the fact that airplanes and helicopters are the only types of 
transport there. Fuel is expensive, costs per flying hour are 
excessively high, and only millionaires can afford the transport 
rates. Traditional customers--petroleum industry workers, 
geologists, fishermen, and gold miners--had to give up aviation. 
Things got to the point where many air detachments performed 
free flights to remote settlements in order to take out sick 
people, women in childbirth, and mail and to deliver bread and 
medical supplies. At the same time, crews do not receive wages 
for months." 
  [Pokomareva] Sad as it may be, the market, about which we 
talk a great deal, dictates its laws. Profitable enterprises 
flourish and unprofitable ones declare themselves bankrupt... 
  [Malinovskiy] Under the present market economy an enterprise 
has an owner. Most of our aviation enterprises, as before, are 
state enterprises, that is, they require budget injections. 
After all, in any, the most developed, country the transport 
system enjoys the concern and support of the state. The entire 
population needs it. Two years ago the Trade Union of Flight 
Personnel proposed that free air transport rates be introduced, 
but, in order that the population should not suffer, that money 
from the budget be allocated for compensation for the needy. 
Which was done. As a result, ticket prices increased, but 75 
billion rubles, which were allocated for compensation in 1993, 
did not reach those to whom they were addressed. Now every 
airport sets its own, often unsubstantiated, prices of fuel, 
spare parts, and maintenance. Departing on a flight, pilots are 
forced to get from their enterprise literally a bag of money and 
from this bag to pay in cash for everything, including the 
cleaning of the airplane. 
  We demand that steps be taken to stop the chaos and 
arbitrariness; for example, to develop a mechanism of payment of 
compensations for the population for air tickets; to establish a 
system of mutual noncash transactions among aviation 
enterprises; to issue a reference catalog with rates of air 
services and to establish economic and administrative sanctions 
for their violation. 
  [Pokomareva] However, in your demands there are also more 
"global" questions, which cannot be solved right away... 
  [Malinovskiy] We fully realize that problems of "small 
aviation," which traditionally serviced other national economic 
sectors, cannot be solved right away. However, those that make 
decisions should at least "face" them. Agriculture suffers, not 
receiving the help of aviation in field fertilization and weed 
control. Forestry incurs losses owing to fires. Reindeer 
breeding brigades and fishing artels are isolated. Power 
industry workers are cutting down on the patrolling of electric 
transmission lines. Oil industry workers cannot use helicopters 
for the delivery of products and materials to places that are 
not easily accessible. It would be realistic to establish an 
intersectorial commission and to determine the necessary volume 
of aviation work and its financing from the budget of every 
sector. There is a need for tax privileges for aviation 
enterprises performing work for the need of the national 
economy, especially in regions of the North and the Far East. 
  [Pokomareva] Are you confident that all 40,000 pilots will 
support the trade union's decision? 
  [Malinovskiy] Two years ago I called a strike "by bluffing." 
Everyone supported it. Right away everyone began to take action, 
became frightened, and came to negotiations. This worked. They 
did not let the strike happen--they accepted our demands. I am 
confident that they will also support us now. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  One of the specialists in the field of air law explained to 
me that the pilots' strike is none other than "destabilization 
of the state transport system" and entails criminal 
responsibility. As a joke he advised that the telephone numbers 
of the "ringleaders" of this undertaking be published in the 
newspaper. For passengers. Then it will become clear who is 
right and who is to blame...

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Maksimov: "Fuel Is Like Bitter Tears"] </F>
  [Text] Remember how many times the cost of gasoline 
has risen unpredictably just recently, causing headaches to car 
lovers. And there are always lines in filling stations and, 
alas, there is always a justified expectation: Once the cost of 
fuel rises, prices of all the rest will also increase. The 
petroleum fever has unwound the flywheel of inflation, devaluing 
the ruble, the population's deposits, pensions, and wages. What 
is this--inevitability connected with the drying up of 
underground storerooms and with the excessive appetites of 
petroleum producers or businessmen trading in fuel? We have 
managed to reveal some secrets of "black gold." The editorial 
department has come across strictly confidential material, 
sensational in its own way, from the Ministry of Fuel and 
Energy, in which this sector's analysts present the most 
unexpected data, which make it possible to see the petroleum 
problem in a new light. 
  For example, it turns out that in our country there is an 
abundance of petroleum. And what abundance! This is what the 
analytic survey "for internal use" states in connection with 
this: "... By the beginning of the second quarter more than 6.5 
million tonnes of unsold crude petroleum accumulated in the 
system of main transport, which exceeded the permissible 
technological level. All free capacities of petroleum and gas 
producing enterprises and petroleum refining plants are filled 
with petroleum and finished products, the remainders of which, 
as compared with the end of last year, have increased one and 
half-fold. Owing to the lack of free capacities, petroleum 
producing enterprises were forced to shut down wells..." 
  The Russian economy has always been unpredictable and 
paradoxical. Even from precious petroleum we have managed to 
make unsalable goods. Of course, both the nonpayment 
crisis--today consumer enterprises owe the Russian Federation 
fuel and energy complex about 20 trillion rubles--and 
shortcomings in the implementation of intergovernmental 
agreements on mutual settlements for petroleum have led to this. 
  The wealth of "petroleum kings" is also no more than another 
myth. We quote the same document. "Various state taxes make up 
about 70 to 90 percent in the structure of the price of 
petroleum products. Tax policy leaves enterprises without funds 
minimally necessary for their functioning and development. High 
taxes and charges make even the export of petroleum products 
inefficient. Their price has almost reached the world level 
mainly owing to taxes, which has made deliveries to the foreign 
market unprofitable..." 
  That is, in the very near future the "king" may prove to be 
naked. Of course, it is a matter of professional petroleum 
industry workers and producers, not of crafty middlemen, who 
manage to extract personal billions from state property. The 
entire sector may prove to be unemployed and bankrupt. These are 
not merely words. From 1992 until today our export to near 
abroad has been reduced to one-half! The reasons are known. The 
insolvency of the Commonwealth countries and the existing price 
formation system... Forget about them, someone will say, we will 
sell petroleum not to the CIS, but to the West for "pure bucks." 
It is not worth having illusions. In 1993 the volume of exported 
fuel and energy resources increased by 23 percent, but prices 
dropped by 19 percent. 
  Commercial structures in the chase after quick "profits" 
sell 
strategic raw materials more cheaply. Momentary advantages are 
the chief things. Who benefits from this? As a result, world 
petroleum prices drop, while our "domestic" prices rise. With 
such a very wild trend, how to fight for sales markets? 
  So much was said about Ukraine's strongest dependence on 
deliveries of Russian fuel: For the sake of gasoline Kiev will 
make any concessions to Moscow. But recently Ukraine has 
purchased 2 million tonnes of petroleum products in Rotterdam. 
It turns out that there they are cheaper than in our country. 
However, the laws of the economy are harsh: Having lost the 
market, later you will spend twice as much in order to get it 
back. 
  True, the fuel and energy complex has done a great deal to 
solve problems. For example, last year it gave about one-half of 
the entire Russian export and, on the whole, ensured the state's 
positive foreign trade balance. It also gave about 40 percent of 
the revenue part of the federal budget. It did not permit 
serious disruptions in deliveries of energy carriers, which 
business managers feared so. Professionalism and experience were 
manifested in this. However, how to proceed further so that the 
failures, at which we have arrived today, do not occur? 
  In the market world the calculation of the cost of any 
commodity--from a necktie to a car--begins from the 
determination of the cost of 1 tonne of grain and 1 tonne of 
petroleum. Later everything "starts" from these two base 
figures. And not otherwise. For now this correlation "walks" by 
itself, causing attacks of the disease in the entire economic 
organism. However, if price proportions are set for a long 
period, for example, for 5 years, other sectors could then 
operate in a stable and calm situation. 
  What is happening today--a spasmodic rise in the cost of 
energy carriers--gives nothing except waves of inflation and an 
economic chaos. Of course, it is important for the state to 
subsidize this process at the initial stage and to help to 
unwind the market mechanism. Later it will begin to produce a 
harvest by itself. 
  Right now, however, without waiting for global shifts, what 
has already been adjusted can and should be preserved; for 
example, trade ties with near abroad. We should continue to sell 
it petroleum, although for some time, on credit; of course, 
strictly indexing calculations. Otherwise, competitors will 
simply capture the market. Incidentally, property can be 
acquired in republics for debts. There are already examples of 
this. The Ministry of Fuel and Energy is now acquiring the 
controlling block of shares of the Lisichansk Petroleum Refining 
Combine, one of the three best production facilities of the 
former Union. A new construction of such a complex in Russia 
would cost billions... 
  In brief, everything is not yet lost. However, to wait until 
everything is buried, until inflation drags the country to an 
abyss, is a folly. We must finally get rid of the constant price 
jitters and lack of confidence in tomorrow and begin to live 
under conditions of a civilized economy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Holovatyy, president of the Ukrainian </F>
Legal Foundation and people's deputy of Ukraine, conducted by V. 
Ye. Anisimov, under the rubric "Anniversaries"; date and place 
not given] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian Legal Foundation is 2 years old. 
Its appearance in a country of homeless judges, intimidated 
procurators, and exhausted lawyers is more remarkable than 
accidental. So many fervent reformers, legal rights activists, 
and democrats "burned out" in the heroic and ineffective 
struggle against the reigning nomenklatura! And finally, the 
understanding has ripened that without reforming the very system 
of legal relations in Ukraine, all attempts to build a free 
society are doomed to failure. This process is a fairly long 
one, since popular legal sophistication is extremely low and 
this situation suits the prevailing regime perfectly: legal 
nihilism is the bulwark of their power. And to prevent this from 
happening, a person continues to seek protection and patronage 
from illustrious dignitaries, stands at the front entrances to 
ministries with placards, and makes the rounds of editorial 
offices, and only at the last remembers the judge and the main 
defender of his civil and human rights, the lawyer. 
  Turning the situation around and bringing Ukraine 
closer to the civilized democratic states by providing 
assistance in conducting reform in the country is the goal which 
the Ukrainian Legal Foundation [UPF], which was created in May 
1992, has pursued. We asked its president, People's Deputy of 
Ukraine Sergey Holovatyy, to tell about the activity and 
prospects of the UPF. 
  [Anisimov] Sergey Petrovich, two years of activity have 
shown 
that the UPF is not a phantom. It has acquired prestige and 
influence, its opinion is taken into consideration, and a great 
deal is being written about it. But first I would like to ask 
about the magic of words. Words such as "democracy," "human 
rights," and a "law-governed state." Only the lazy do not speak 
them today. And it seems that they have become a reality. 
  [Holovatyy] That, as you remember, is an old and tested 
device of the nomenklatura. The Kravchuk's and Plyushch's and 
others use them very successfully. They devalued the meaning of 
these concepts very quickly by repeating them all the time but 
doing nothing. Slogans are for the sake of slogans. The creation 
of the UPF did in fact pursue the goal of moving from grating 
appeals to real concrete work. 
  [Anisimov] Whose idea was it to create the Foundation? 
  [Holovatyy] Its roots come from back in the time of the 
Union, in 1990. At that time a group of jurists (Nikazakov, 
Ayvazyan, Holovatyy, Muzychenko, Kisil, Shishkin, and others) 
was the initiator of the creation of the Association of 
Ukrainian Jurists. We understood very well that the state, and 
that means the bureaucratic apparat, was not interested in 
reforming itself. Bureaucrats understand that any reforms--in 
the economy (the market, private ownership), a multiparty 
system, jurists, the bar, or the court becoming 
independent--will inevitably lead to the loss of bureaucratic 
omnipotence and the loss of status. And although following that 
Ukraine became an independent state, the system remained as 
before: It was nurtured and lives under the laws of the Country 
of the Soviets. In such a society, a jurist was part of the 
mechanism for serving the nomenklatura's interests, and for that 
very reason could not be a supporter of reforms and 
democratization. And even now most of Ukraine's jurists do not 
realize what the independence of the legal profession is. They 
do not know how to be a jurist and not perform a servile 
function, to be a lackey. Do you recall many cases where jurists 
defended a citizen in his suit against the state? On the 
contrary, they defended the state from people. 
  So the first thing that we wanted was to change the jurist's 
role and position in society, to eliminate the servile essence, 
and to achieve complete independence of his professional 
activity. The natural human right to life, freedom, and private 
ownership should be a law for him. But jurists work in different 
systems: Some go to court to defend a citizen's rights, while 
others (judges) apply the law created by the state. If the first 
are independent, the others should be as well. Judges should not 
be in the chain of corrupted power (judge, procurator, raysoviet 
chairman, rayon administration chairman, and so forth). We 
decided to break this chain and understood that a comprehensive 
program of reform of Ukraine's legal system was needed. 
  [Anisimov] And the state ordered the Association of 
Ukrainian 
Jurists to develop such a program? 
  [Holovatyy] Of course not. The Association had no money, but 
it had an intellectual charge. And in order to obtain money, a 
plan was needed. A plan for reforming Ukraine's legal system 
whose ultimate goal was to create a free society where human 
rights and freedoms, above all the sacred right of private 
ownership, were guaranteed. Such a plan was formulated together 
with foreign jurists. It interested George Soros and Karl 
Lopper's Zurich Foundation, which supported it materially. That 
is how the Ukrainian Legal Foundation emerged. 
  [Anisimov] We have acquainted our readers with the child of 
the UPF, the Ukrainian Center for Human Rights, and covered the 
first all-Ukrainian human rights hearings conducted by it. Let 
us talk a little about other areas of the Foundation's activity. 
  [Holovatyy] The creation of the Ukrainian Center for Human 
Rights is 1 of 10 programs of the Foundation. They are 
interrelated and no particular one of them can be considered the 
main one or another one--secondary. Let us take the program 
"Codification of Ukrainian Legislation." The program is supposed 
to assist the lawmaking process in Ukraine in order to change it 
and bring it closer to European standards. The basic codifying 
enactments, civil, criminal, administrative, and so forth, must 
constitute a system of legal enactments, be reconciled with one 
another, and be based on the Constitution. We conducted two 
international symposiums on the draft Constitution with 
involvement of Western experts, and many of our recommendations 
were taken into consideration by the working group. Conferences 
on the Civil and Criminal codes were also held. At the 
suggestion of the UPF conference held in Kharkov in December of 
last year, the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine 
created a national Codification Commission. Overall the 
effectiveness of this program is very high--many of the 
proposals are being adopted by the groups which are formulating 
legal enactments. 
  The next program is related to a problem we already talked 
about. You must agree that no matter how democratic the codes 
are, they must be applied. And to do this a lawyer is needed, an 
independent lawyer who is in no way linked to the state. 
Associations of lawyers which are based on self-government and 
have their own codes of honor exist in all civilized countries. 
A lawyer can be expelled from the association for accepting 
bribes or other violations. This decision will not depend on 
whether he is a friend of the procurator or a functionary from 
the ministry of internal affairs. The creation of an independent 
professional organization of jurists as well as an independent 
judicial system in Ukraine are extremely important problems. 
Tell me, if a judge receives an apartment from the state (or 
functionaries), how can we speak of his independence? 
  [Anisimov] But just who should offer this apartment to him? 
  [Holovatyy] A judge must be able to buy it as a free 
citizen. 
And his material support must guarantee that for him. Of course 
this is difficult today, but after all we are speaking of a 
long-term program of reform of post-totalitarian society. It is 
very difficult to change this system in 5-10 years. 
  Moreover, can we speak of the independence of the lawyer and 
judge when legal cadres in our country are still trained on the 
Soviet plan? Soviet jurists were trained in two specializations: 
Soviet development and legal scholar. The goal of instruction 
was to train jurists for repressive functions and to support the 
system. But we want a jurist to protect, as in any democratic 
society, higher values, life, and property, rather than the 
system. A person should call only on him in all situations. 
Especially now when we are moving toward the market. In the West 
a jurist is 90 percent involved with civil law and private law 
relations. And we must have such jurists trained under the 
standards of democratic countries, as the colleges of the 
Western universities do. So the next program envisioned the 
founding of the Center for Legal Studies. It was created on the 
base of the Kiev-Mogilyanskiy Academy University and will train 
highly qualified cadres of jurists for the country's scientific 
and educational institutions and will also be involved in basic 
and applied research in the area of the state and law. On its 
basis, VUZ instructors will be retrained and improve their 
skills, and it will develop textbooks and aids on questions of 
law, translate foreign literature on legal questions, and engage 
in publishing. An understanding has been reached with foreign 
partners that in the fall of this year, the first graduate 
students will go to study in the universities of England, 
France, and Belgium. 
  The fifth UPF program envisions the creation of a Center for 
Universal Minimum Legal Education of the Public. People must 
abandon legal nihilism and find out how they should live in the 
new legal system. However this is impossible without law 
literature. But in Ukraine there are no publishing houses which 
produce legal information. In Soviet Ukraine there was 
Politizdat, which published laws in the Ukrainian language. In 
the 2 years of our independence, not a single law has been 
published in brochure form. The Ukrainian Legal Foundation 
published the first Law on the Election of Deputies of the 
Supreme Soviet in a half million copies. Coming soon, and in 
large runs too, are the laws on Election of the President of 
Ukraine and on Election to the Local Organs of Power. The 
publishing house Pravo founded by the UPF is handling these 
publications and in the future should become a powerful national 
publisher of law literature. The first issue of the 
scientific-practical journal UKRAINSKE PRAVO published by the 
UPF will come out soon as well. 
  A separate program of ours envisions help in organizing and 
financing conferences and symposiums on timely legal issues 
conducted by state and other organizations. The last such 
conference on the principles of the Criminal Code was conducted 
by the Internal Affairs Academy. We allocated the money for it 
and invited experts and specialists. 
  Stipends and on-site training for our legal specialists in 
foreign VUZes and colleges (from 2-3 weeks to 3 months) are an 
important program. A few days ago we selected, based on 
interviews, six people for on-site training at London 
University. And finally, there is a program to create a national 
law library in Ukraine. The library has already been set up on 
Kostelnaya Street and teachers, graduate students, and students 
of Kiev VUZes visit it. At present its collection consists of 
4,000 books, the universities of Canada gave 500 books, and it 
subscribes to 6 foreign legal journals and has ties with foreign 
libraries. 
  [Anisimov] And do state structures help your Foundation's 
activity? 
  [Holovatyy] I already said that the state as a system of 
bureaucracy is not interested in reforming itself. But 
bureaucrats constitute 5 percent of the population, while 
society makes up 95 percent. Moreover, there comes a time when 
the bureaucrat becomes a pensioner and an ordinary citizen and 
enters into those legal relations where he needs to go to court 
and protect his rights as a person and a citizen. He will not 
always be able to utilize the "telephone right" and contacts. 
And then he too begins to think that the system should 
apparently be changed. We do not receive any help at all from 
the state. We seek money and find it abroad. Even our requests 
for space for a publishing house and library were ignored. They 
distribute space to anyone you like, but not to us. 
  But come what may, it seems to me that the Ukrainian Legal 
Foundation has taken its first steps quite confidently. And no 
matter what, I am certain that independent Ukraine will become a 
law-governed state, since there is simply no other way.

<F P=106> [Interview with Levko Lukyanenko by Mariya Bazelyuk, under </F>
the rubric "Interview of Current Interest"; place and date not 
given: "When the Leeway for Maneuvering Is Very Narrow: 
Interview with Prominent Politician Levko Lukyanenko"] 
  [Text] 
  [Bazelyuk] Mr. Lukyanenko, could you briefly discuss the 
current political sentiment in Ukraine associated with possible 
presidential elections? 
  [Lukyanenko] Whether presidential elections are to be held 
or 
not is indeed the most burning problem of the current political 
development in Ukraine. Preparations for elections to the local 
organs of power have begun; elections to the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine are not complete yet. We are living in a particularly 
stormy period. Even earlier I believed that the political system 
needs to be changed, but not all at once. For stability to exist 
in the state, we could successively elect first the parliament, 
subsequently the local organs of power, and then the president, 
rather than all of them at once. Our state, which has not yet 
grown strong, has faced all three of these great problems 
simultaneously. That an appropriate legislative foundation has 
not been laid yet is another complication. 
  I think that completion of our parliament, so that it will 
have 450 deputies and be able to work normally, is the most 
important issue. The elections of the president and the local 
organs of power are also very important, but they should be held 
at a later date. Given that we have not succeeded in putting 
together the Supreme Council and this process is being dragged 
out until July, whereas the presidential elections have been 
scheduled for June, all of this generates incredibly great 
strains which are hard for the people to bear. The people are 
not in their most active period, which occurred in 1989 through 
1991, and for this reason their participation in these numerous 
elections at the same time may present a problem. These will be 
elections in which people will be elected at random, or the 
voters simply will not come to the polling stations at all. 
  I think that the elections of the president and the local 
organs of power should not only be postponed but be held at 
different times. I am in favor of holding them toward the end of 
this year or even in the first quarter of next year. This would 
be the fall and winter season, when people are not involved in 
farm work and have more spare time to examine candidates in a 
more serious and profound manner. 
  As far as rescheduling the presidential elections is 
concerned, the motive is different. A legal foundation has not 
been laid, the rights and responsibilities of the president have 
not been fully set forth. The very time of the 
election--June--is very close; however, this is a time when 
students have a break and many people are on vacation. 
Consequently, it is highly likely that the election will be 
frustrated, and the funds spent will go down the drain. To this 
day it has not been determined whether ours will be a 
presidential republic, presidential-parliamentary republic, or 
parliamentary republic, and this also does matter in a 
presidential election. In principle, I think that our current 
shortcomings result from the fact that our president himself 
displays insufficient determination and firmness in his post 
rather than from the incompleteness of the legal foundation. 
That is to say, there is a lack of will rather than a lack of 
law in this instance. However, we want to create a rule-of-law 
state after all in which rights and responsibilities will be 
clearly defined. 
  [Bazelyuk] You mentioned that the president does not always 
show his willpower, and I agree with you. However, let us look 
to ourselves for the reason why. Why is he indecisive? Could it 
be because the democratic forces did not stand behind him like a 
monolithic wall and did not breathe down his neck? Perhaps it 
would after all be important to adequately surround the 
president. Understandably, it is very hard to consider 
nonpopulist decisions. Do you also see the fault of the 
democratic forces in our having the capability to do more, even 
in the political situation that we have, but not doing it? 
  [Lukyanenko] I do think that the democratic forces could 
have 
done more than they have even with this president, but in a 
different manner. Our president is a very intelligent man, and 
not just intelligent but also cunning. In his time, the 
president said that he would draw on Rukh's support, but Rukh 
supposedly did not support him--I mean our nationwide democratic 
movement rather than the Rukh-party. I am certain that this was 
cunningness on the part of our Mr. President; he did not even 
think about drawing on the support of the Rukh-party or other 
democratic organizations because if he wanted to draw on support 
from the democratic forces, he would have proceeded differently. 
Mr. President says that the Supreme Council restricted his 
actions. Let us assume this is so. However, out of the entire 
Cabinet of Ministers the Supreme Council confirms eight 
ministers, and the president appoints the rest of the ministers 
himself. Second, he has created a presidential team of those who 
serve as his advisers, etc. Who did he draft for the positions 
of ministers whom he had the opportunity to appoint them 
himself, or who did he use to form the presidential entourage 
which is important because it develops draft laws? The president 
brought in Fokin, Symonenko--a stubborn partocrat from 
Odessa--and other former friends from the CPSU, and on a pro 
forma basis--certain people from the democratic milieu. However, 
in essence his team is full of old friends from the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. So, there are no 
grounds for the idea that he could be different. Our president 
is a product of the communist system. It is indeed so, and I 
agree with you that the president could have acted otherwise had 
the democratic forces acted otherwise, without joining the 
president's team. He should have been influenced from the 
street--through rallies, hunger strikes, protests, hundreds of 
thousands of people convening in front of the Supreme Council, 
strong pressure. 
  I know from my experience that the actual political course 
has a vector value. It results from the action of various 
forces. Had the democratic forces continued to act as they did 
in 1991 and demanded changes, this vector value would have 
obviously been somewhat more to the right, and on the whole 
reforms would have taken off long ago in our country, that is to 
say, the situation could have been different. 
  [Bazelyuk] What if the presidential election is held, after 
all, and we face the choice: We have what we have. I am not 
talking about the openly antistate communists. We have Leonid 
Kravchuk and Ivan Plyushch among those who have been nominated. 
Recently, Ivan Stepanovych said in Lisichansk that he is a 
supporter of federalism as a modern, democratic form of system, 
and said other strange things. Who are we to vote for? 
  [Lukyanenko] Indeed, our leeway for maneuvering is very 
narrow because we know for sure than none of the democrats would 
win the presidency. The election has revealed very curious 
things. The communist cobweb which the empire wove on the 
territory of Ukraine over 70 years has not been destroyed and 
torn to shreds but has remained whole and shown itself in a big 
way. It has perceived its strength, and we have perceived its 
strength, which will be revealed in the presidential election. 
This is why it would be an exercise in futility to field a 
democratic candidate. We have this minuscule leeway--from 
Plyushch to Kravchuk. It is between them that we have to choose. 
Which one of them is better? 
  Kravchuk is an advocate of the state but without willpower, 
as a result of which two and a half years have been taken up by 
the gradual decay of the economy and its plundering rather than 
the building of an independent Ukraine. Plyushch is also an 
advocate of the state, and in this he has an advantage over 
Moroz and Kuchma. All of them are nondemocratic candidates. 
However, we have been put into such a narrow framework when we 
have to choose among people who are not ours, among bad 
candidates, someone who is a little bit better, that is, the 
lesser evil. I see Plyushch as being a lesser evil. He is an 
advocate of the state. 
  [Bazelyuk] However, if he starts talking about the 
federation 
yet again, nobody on most of the territory of Ukraine will take 
him seriously. 
  [Lukyanenko] Let us take a different view. In preparation 
for 
the elections, Plyushch went to Lisichansk rather than Lvov. Had 
he stated that he comes out in favor of a unitary Ukraine he 
would have pushed away many people, because recently very 
vigorous anti-Ukrainian, subversive, communist, pro-imperial 
activities have been conducted there. A certain segment of 
people have been influenced by this propaganda which is hostile 
to Ukraine. Plyushch responded, taking this sentiment into 
account. His answer is a model of obscurity. This obscurity was 
conscious, it was clouding the entire audience rather than 
clouding minds. It is a very good obscurity because it does not 
bind him and does not give anybody the opportunity to accuse him 
of whatever they like. Therefore, I simply see this as a talent 
of his. 
  [Bazelyuk] Halychyna expects to have its own candidate in 
your person. Will you run? 
  [Lukyanenko] I think I will run. You know, when I look at a 
list of 112 seats and picture that the communists may get all of 
them, I grow fearful, and out of this fear I want to fill one of 
the gaps with my own person. They have proposed Kiev, Lvov, and 
Ternopol to me. I am rather leaning toward Ternopol. 
  [Bazelyuk] Thank you for the conversation. I wish you 
success.

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Karpenko, editor in chief of VECHIRNIY </F>
KYYIV, under the rubric "Column of the Editor in Chief": 
"President Torpedoes Elections"] 
  [Text] The Message of the President of Ukraine to the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine has been published. There would be 
nothing peculiar about it--it is the right of the president to 
address anybody with any words--were it not for certain nuances 
which make this document somewhat strange. 
  First, the president is appealing to a Supreme 
Council whose election was undesirable for him; this was shown 
by his appearances on television before the elections when, 
instead of appealing to the population to come to the polling 
stations and do their civic duty, he started to consider in 
public whether a parliament would be elected or not, and whether 
it would be full-fledged or not if it in fact was elected. 
Naturally, many people interpreted this step as a signal to the 
effect that the election to the Supreme Council was a secondary 
thing, and that it was not necessary to turn out for it. 
However, contrary to the prophecies and efforts of certain 
forces to frustrate the election, it was held, and the Supreme 
Council, although not its full membership, was elected after 
all. This is why the presidential message to it sounds somewhat 
hypocritical. 
  Second, the president is addressing the supreme 
legislative organ of the country for the one and only purpose of 
postponing the next presidential elections, which, incidentally, 
are already going ahead full tilt; there are already candidates 
for the post of president who have collected the necessary 
number of citizens' votes in their support. This is happening 
after the president--to be sure, under pressure from the 
population and the threat of a miners' strike--himself agreed to 
the early elections but suddenly changed his position. 
  Third, the president himself agreed to run for 
another term, having previously announced publicly that he would 
not take part in the early elections and reversed his position 
yet again by then. 
  Such, putting it mildly, inconsistency is not random: It is 
the main trait of our president. Any number of examples can be 
given, but let us recall the most characteristic one when, 
heading to negotiations with Yeltsin in Massandra, our president 
had in hand the proposals for the even division of the Black Sea 
Fleet between Ukraine and Russia that had been developed by 
professionals, but at the last hour suddenly changed his mind 
and agreed to sell Ukraine's part of the fleet to the adjacent 
state. This is precisely what became the main reason that 
Morozov, minister of defense of Ukraine at the time and an 
honest and principled man, felt compelled to resign. 
  However, let us revisit the content of the message. 
  In substantiating the undesirability of early presidential 
elections, the president referred to three aspects--political, 
economic, and legal. The president thinks that, in terms of the 
political aspect, early elections will not only fail 
to consolidate the state but will also polarize political forces 
and exacerbate their confrontation. 
  Well, it is no secret that the struggle in the elections 
will 
be between various political forces. However, this is precisely 
what democratic elections provide for, and it is the will of the 
people to make a particular force preponderant. The state may be 
consolidated precisely during the elections if the people make a 
specific program preponderant, for example, the idea of rallying 
all national-patriotic forces on the basis of the results of the 
1991 referendum--this will be the consolidation of the state all 
right. 
  On the contrary, the postponement of the early elections, 
which the president desires, will not only tighten the noose 
around the neck of Ukraine, as the well-known economist 
Volodymyr Chernyak aptly indicated, but may also cause a social 
explosion. So, let us recall that the decision on early 
presidential elections was made on the initiative of and under 
pressure from the miners. Is it really necessary for them to 
also become the guarantors of holding the elections, assembling 
once again in front of the Supreme Council or the presidential 
residence? 
  Further on the president intimidates us with the possibility 
of the election campaign bringing about the federalization and 
dismemberment of Ukraine. This is not quite comprehensible, if 
for no other reason than because none other than our president 
comes out in favor of establishing special economic zones in 
Ukraine, thus creating a nutritive medium for the idea of 
federalization; none other than our president saw through a law 
on the autonomization of the Crimea during his tenure as 
chairman of the Supreme Council; it was his subsequent apathetic 
and passive position with regard to the development of events in 
the Crimea that caused the Crimea to be virtually lost to 
Ukraine. 
  As far as the economic aspect is concerned, the 
president believes that the June elections may "bring about the 
destruction of the instruments of state influence on the 
condition of the economy." However, it was precisely this "state 
influence" that brought about the current condition of our 
economy and the impoverishment of the people. It has been 
commonly recognized that reforms are not advancing in Ukraine. 
Nor will they advance because they are not advantageous for the 
supreme echelon of power, which to this day advocates this 
"state influence" on the economy which makes it possible for 
this echelon to effect, under the guise of privatization, the 
redistribution of public property in its favor. By now it has 
become clear to all that economic reforms will only advance once 
profound political reform has been implemented. The June 
presidential and local elections are the first step toward the 
reform and the change of power which Ukraine desperately needs 
at present. 
  The largest section of the presidential message is devoted 
to 
the legal aspect of the consequences of the 
forthcoming early elections. It contains discourse and thoughts; 
however, once again, everything is subordinated to proving the 
truth--the only one to the mind of the president--that the 
elections are infeasible. He said that the Constitution should 
first be adopted, the status of the president should be 
determined, and only later should elections be considered. 
Certainly, the Constitution should be adopted, but it would be 
feasible for it to be adopted by a Constitutional Assembly or a 
Constitutional Convention elected for this purpose alone rather 
than the Supreme Council, which is objectively interested in a 
Constitution "tailored to itself." However, in either event the 
adoption of the Constitution is a complex and lengthy process; 
if we were to follow the president, the Constitution may be in 
the process of adoption for so long that the state of Ukraine 
itself may no longer exist. 
  In summation, let us ask this question: To whom is it 
advantageous to postpone the early presidential and local 
elections? Which forces stand to win by this? If we proceed from 
the fact that the forthcoming elections are nothing but a form 
of the aggravation of the struggle for the redistribution of 
power and property (or property and power), it will become 
understandable that postponing the elections means conserving 
the current authorities headed by the president for a period of 
time and giving them an opportunity to grow stronger and to 
complete "grab-it-ization." It is not early presidential 
elections that are a factor of instability in our state but 
rather the inconsistency of the president, the ineffectiveness 
of his policy, and the fact that an integrated effective program 
to overcome the crisis and develop Ukraine has not even been 
developed in three years. 
  It is hard to predict what stance the Supreme Council will 
take with regard to the message. However, if it were to follow 
the president's lead it would, first, be guilty of a 
transgression against the miners who have ensured this early 
election and, second, would exacerbate the political and 
economic agony of the state, the possible outcome of which is 
easy to predict. However the June elections might end, they are 
acutely necessary from the political, economic, and social 
standpoints. Ukraine must go through these elections. There is 
no other way. Virtually all states of Eastern Europe, in which 
several governments and parliaments have changed over these 
years, have travelled this painful path. As you can see, Ukraine 
is late on this score, too. The mistake needs to be corrected, 
and the frustration of the June elections should not be allowed 
to occur, no matter how this frustration might be packaged for 
us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michal Uzemblo, commercial attache of the </F>
Embassy of the Republic of Poland in Ukraine, by Vitaliy Kvitko 
in Kiev; date not given: "The Possibilities of Polish-Ukrainian 
Trade and Economic Cooperation Are Far From Exhausted"] 
  [Text] 50 Bogdan Khmelnitskiy Street, Kiev. This is 
the location of the Trade and Economic Department of the Embassy 
of the Republic of Poland in Ukraine. It is headed by Commercial 
Attache Michal Uzemblo. Our BIZNES correspondent met with Mr. 
Uzemblo and asked him to describe the state and prospects of the 
development of Polish-Ukrainian trade and economic 
relations. 
  [Kvitko] Mr. Uzemblo, it is far from your first year in 
Ukraine, and you are well acquainted with our economic 
situation. Tell us, please, are there practicable prerequisites 
for an increase in mutually profitable cooperation between our 
countries? 
  [Uzemblo] Ukraine has been an independent state only for 
three years. It is natural, therefore, that you have had this 
whole time to surmount the well-known difficulties of the 
formation of statehood. In addition, Ukraine inherited from the 
former USSR quite a complex and unregulated economy, and the 
economic relations that had operated for years both with 
countries of the former USSR and with the participants in the 
disintegrated Council for Economic Mutual Assistance (CEMA), one 
of the biggest partners among which was Poland, were disrupted. 
The command levers of the control of cooperation, which had 
frequently flouted considerations of elementary advantage, 
ceased to operate, and commodity turnover between our countries 
declined. 
  Account also has to be taken of the fact that by the time 
Ukraine had acquired its sovereignty, Poland had already 
implemented a number of economic reforms en route to the market. 
This meant that trading as before was no longer possible. You 
yourself will realize that perfectly understandable 
considerations of advantage, without which a real market is 
inconceivable, came into play. The decline in commodity turnover 
was perfectly natural, therefore. A payments crisis, when 
Ukrainian enterprises were unable to pay for supplies from 
Poland in hard currency and your national currency rapidly 
declined in value, was superimposed in addition. The situation 
was rescued neither by commodity-exchange transactions nor 
so-called barter.... 
  Nonetheless, I would like to mention that at the interstate 
level Poland was one of the first to sign with Ukraine, in May 
1992, a treaty on good-neighborliness, friendly relations, and 
cooperation, which laid the legal foundations for a 
qualitatively new system of relations between our states within 
the framework of the process of transformations in Central and 
East Europe. 
  Today economic relations between Ukraine and Poland are 
regulated, aside from the said treaty, by: 
  1) the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation of 4 
October 1991. 
  2) The Convention on the Avoidance of Dual Taxation and the 
Prevention of Income and Property Tax Evasion of 12 January 1993. 
  3) The Agreement on the Mutual Promotion and Protection of 
Investments of 12 January 1993. 
  4) The Agreement on Interregional Cooperation. 
  An Intergovernmental Commission on Trade and Economic 
Cooperation, whose activity is contributing to the further 
development of bilateral economic relations, was formed on the 
basis of the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation and the 
protocol of 12 January 1993. 
  [Kvitko] And how productive has the commission's 
contribution 
to bilateral cooperation been? 
  [Uzemblo] You know that we do not have the right to dictate 
to our entrepreneurs with whom they should conclude deals. But 
at the government level the parties have agreed for the 
establishment of efficient mutually profitable cooperation to 
promote a resumption of relations between enterprises and to 
support their development at small and medium-sized business 
level, to contribute to the creation of joint ventures, and to 
establish a system of mutual notification of the parties of 
legislative instruments in force in their countries that 
regulate financial, legal, customs, and economic matters. 
  The commission has been quite productive, I believe. 
According to Polish customs data, commodity turnover increased 
from $337 million in 1992 to $386.8 million in 1993. In 
addition, the practice of joint entrepreneurial activity is 
characterized by the fact that Poland is in first place in terms 
of the number of joint ventures on the territory of Ukraine. 
Their number has risen to 580. The exports of these ventures 
constitute $22,980,900, and imports, $18,092,100. According to 
figures of the Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine, 
Polish-Ukrainian joint ventures constitute 17.8 percent of the 
total number of those operating in the country. 
  [Kvitko] Nonetheless, use is, most likely, being made of far 
from all possibilities for the development and expansion of 
cooperation. And the reason is by no means a lack of interest in 
Ukraine among our Polish partners. What can you say in this 
connection? 
  [Uzemblo] Polish business has a tremendous interest in 
Ukraine. Proof of this is not only the first place in terms of 
the number of joint ventures but also the fact that 
approximately 50 of our firms have opened and registered their 
offices in Ukraine. In addition, Polish entrepreneurs are 
readily participating in many exhibitions which are being held 
in Ukraine and actively inviting their Ukrainian partners to 
exhibitions and fairs in Poland.... 
  But the fact that there has yet to be in Ukraine the total 
liberalization of foreign economic activity, economic and 
financial stabilization has not been achieved, and your national 
unit of currency has not become even internally convertible is a 
reality also. 
  Given the least signs of stabilization in Ukraine, the 
Polish 
entrepreneur would respond appropriately. And our Ukrainian 
partners are well enough aware of our possibilities. This 
includes agricultural production and also machinery and 
equipment for food and light industry, wood processing and 
furniture production, medical equipment, the manufacture of 
medicines and veterinary preparations, and much else. What I 
have listed, I believe, is merely a small particle of the 
possible interaction of our enterprises and entrepreneurs....

  [Text] Despite the great difference in the statistical data 
of the two countries in respect to trade turnover (the Polish 
customs employ the generally accepted SAD system), a growth of 
commodity turnover was observed in 1993 compared with 1992 (see 
table, in $):

  The main items exported to Poland were iron ore, slag, and

  As the Ministry of Industry of Ukraine has reported, mining 
enterprises of Ukraine in 1993 alone concluded contracts with 
Polish firms totaling $93,478,400, including contracts in hard 
currency totaling $57,040,700 and barter contracts totaling 
$36,437,700. Ukraine's enterprises supplied Poland in 1993 with 
5,046,000 tonnes of untreated iron ore, including 2,211,000 
tonnes of agglomeration ore, 1,185,000 tonnes of concentrate, 
and 1,650,000 tonnes of pellet. Polish firms are supplying 
Ukraine on a barter basis with: 
  a meat-packing plant; 
  drilling equipment and spares for oil production; 
  mine equipment; 
  trucks, lift trucks, and spares; 
  diesel fuel and gasoline; 
  consumer goods and such. 
<H5>  List of Possible Exports of Materials From Ukraine </H5>
  The Ministry of Industry of Ukraine offers for export to the 
Republic of Poland: 
  bar products, wide-gauge track, girders and channels, wheels 
and tires, plate (8-50 mm), shipbuilding steel [sudolist], 
ball-bearing steel, rolled circular-section special steels, pig 
iron, untreated iron ore, large-diameter pipes (720-1,400 mm), 
steel wire, nails, industrial carbon, soda ash, furniture, wood 
fiber slabs, plywood, acetic acid, sulfur. 
  In 1993 Ukraine purchased from the Republic of Poland 
1,215,000 tonnes of coking coal, and the purchase of 3 million 
tonnes is planned for 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Sokol: "Why Privatization Is </F>
`Faltering'"] 
  [Text] A regular session of the Coordinating Committee for 
Fighting Corruption and Organized Crime was convened 20 April 
under the chairmanship of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. 
Questions regarding measures to prevent abuses and criminal 
phenomena in the course of privatization were brought up for 
discussion, but in fact problems in privatization overall 
constituted the subject of consideration. 
  Only 2,390 facilities have been privatized over more than 
two 
years. These comprise 11.3 percent of Group A enterprises and 10 
percent of those in other groups. One of the most important 
tasks is the privatization of incomplete construction projects. 
There are about 55,000 such facilities, but only 52 are listed 
for privatization! The main practice in privatization consists 
of redemption and leasing with redemption. Other forms of 
destatization are not held in high esteem. Auctions and 
competitive bidding are seldom conducted. One other significant 
aspect: Only 706,000 Ukrainian citizens, i.e., 2 percent, took 
advantage of privatization certificates. 
  Session participants noted that the privatization process is 
clearly being hampered by ministries and organs of local 
authority. Defective legislation also interferes in this 
regard--in many instances a mechanism for carrying out this 
process is lacking. In the view of Oleksandr Zavada, chairman of 
the Ukraine Antimonopoly Committee, the whole problem lies in 
the fact that even state enterprises are not upholding state 
regulation (of prices, resources, etc.) and payment of taxes (90 
percent of income). We need not even mention private 
enterprises. In a number of cases, change in ownership is 
impossible due to a breakdown in the technology chain. Many 
people are convinced that privatization will not proceed until 
the state stops subsidizing poor workers. 
  Abuses are flourishing magnificently against the background 
of all these difficulties. Benefits afforded by legislation to 
labor collectives are being actively exploited. Shady 
businessmen engage in money laundering under this cover, and 
foreign investors operate in a fashion which is not best for us. 
  The impression has been created that someone is forcing 
privatization to "falter." Leonid Kravchuk even posed the 
question: "Perhaps they are deliberately proceeding in this 
manner, engaging specifically in plunder?" Minister of Economics 
Roman Shpek explained that a struggle is still underway in 
society concerning whether or not to conduct privatization. He 
noted that over the course of a year the Supreme Council has 
never been able to examine the program for this operation. 
  The committee adopted an appropriate resolution. It is 
planned to accelerate the development of proposals on the 
introduction of amendments and additions to existing legislation 
on matters of the privatization of property of state enterprises 
and land, and accelerate presentation of these proposals to the 
Cabinet of Ministers. The same applies to proposals on 
establishing responsibility for violations of the legislation on 
privatization and presentation of these proposals for 
confirmation by the Supreme Council of Ukraine. 
  A great deal depends on the new parliament. As the president 
expressed it, the parliamentarians must either halt the 
privatization process entirely or place it on track as required.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Smaha: "The Steal of the Century? PRYVATNA </F>
SPRAVA Invites a Public Debate in the Pages of VECHIRNIY KYYIV 
by Officials of the State Property Fund and the Anti-Monopoly 
Committee Concerning Privatization in Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Wonderful are Thy works, O Lord! Mass 
privatization in Ukraine is still in the talking stage. And at 
this crucial moment, its main character--the State Property 
Fund--sends the draft "Ukraine Law on Changes to the Ukraine Law 
`On the Privatization of State Enterprises'" to the Supreme 
Council and the President for signature. The bill reads: "The 
Supreme Council decrees that the following changes be made to 
Paragraph 1, Article 8 of the Law: remove the words `citizens of 
Ukraine.'" 
  That passage of the Law reads: The right to 
privatization shall be enjoyed by citizens of Ukraine, foreign 
citizens, and stateless persons.... So it looks as if the State 
Property Fund does not want fellow-citizens. They are just in 
the way. But why? 
  Let us recall that the State Property Fund soon plans to 
privatize 150 items of state property that it has designated and 
to run an advertising campaign inviting people to invest their 
certificates in them. 
  Is this bad or good? "What associations does the number 150 
call up for you?", television viewers are asked. Let us reflect 
on this. There are 76,000 [as printed; probably should be 6,000] 
state enterprises in Ukraine. Formally they are matched by 
citizens' 52 million privatization certificates. How many of 
those 52 million vouchers do you think the State Property Fund 
will attract to those 150 enterprises? And how many vouchers 
will be left over for privatizing the 5,850 (approximately) 
enterprises that are left over? 
  Do you see? Try to imagine how much your voucher will 
depreciate when millions of people try to invest theirs in the 
"first" wave of privatization. Everybody is aware that after 
that there will be a "second" and "third" wave. At that point, 
the State Property Fund is going to need intermediate agents. 
The list of them has already been designated by state decision. 
It is the agent's aim, of course, to make a profit. Therefore a 
trust (which is what the intermediate agency is called) will 
obtain from citizens both their certificates and the right to 
exercise ownership. Let us emphasize that it is their lawful 
right. Hence, the "first" wave of privatization as planned by 
the State Property Fund will cut the price of the vouchers, 
while the "second" and "third" waves will turn things over 
entirely to the financial sharks. 
  We are assured that a certificate is worth a million 
karbovantsy [Ukrainian rubles]. V. Pylypchuk, a member of the 
former Supreme Council Presidium, reminds us that there have 
already been two indexations of fixed assets--by a factor of 
11.5 and a factor of 40. The product of those figures should 
form an index by which it is useful to multiply the property 
value of the certificate. Having performed these simple 
operations, we divide the resulting figure by the dollar's 
exchange rate (40,000) and get 4,040 dollars. Even that, 
however, is not the market value of the certificate. An ordinary 
bathhouse in Odessa was sold at auction for 3 billion 
karbovantsy after a starting price of 1 million--a 3,000-fold 
increase. Hence, our correction for the market value (2.5 times) 
is maximally understated. In fact, the value of our Ukrainian 
voucher is vastly more than 10,000 dollars! (which, 
incidentally, has already been reported in VECHIRNIY KYYIV). If 
a person knows the value of his voucher, he will come to respect 
it more. And he will invest it wisely, and not just give it away 
to the first person he meets. 
  Of course, citizens who try to do these calculations, and 
organizations which help them do it, trusts which have their own 
views on privatization, are undesirable to those who aspire to 
destatization for their own sakes. These latter were especially 
displeased by the newspaper PRYVATNA SPRAVA, which tried to 
explain people's rights to them and their chance to acquire 
their fair share of state property. In addition to a series of 
"accusatory" articles in the controlled press and the 
above-mentioned draft amendment to the law, Anti-Monopoly 
Committee Chairman Oleksandr Zavada himself sent a letter to the 
Deputy Chairman of the Board of SPPU [the Union of Private 
Entrepreneurs of Ukraine] (the newspaper is its organ) 
concerning the start of investigations into dishonest 
competition with respect to anti-monopoly legislation. 
  A spicy detail: this was done at the initiative of persons 
having a particular interest--the Association of Securities 
Dealers. I have before me a copy of KOMERSANT UKRAYINY (No 13, 
March). It has a report of a meeting of the Association (I 
remind you that [a] this is not a state body, and [b] it is an 
association of businessmen). I quote: "The latest meeting of the 
Association of Securities Dealers held a preliminary discussion 
of spheres of control. The advertising [of PRYVATNA SPRAVA and 
the SPPU--editor] will have to be overseen by the Anti-Monopoly 
Committee." Think about that: a civilian commercial organization 
is directing a state body--the Anti-Monopoly Committee--to 
"oversee" someone's advertising. Where does the Association get 
off acting like a Masonic lodge in terms of influence on a state 
apparatus! Let us continue the quote. "The State Property 
Fund (FDM) was directed [emphasis mine--V. S.] to submit a 
proposal to the Provisional Commission of the Supreme Council on 
an amendment to repeal the paragraph on creating purchasers's 
unions based on residence." Which was done. 
  True to its obligations, the FDM did on 1 April submit the 
appropriate legislative initiative to the Supreme Council (see 
above). In effect, this amendment would signal "privatization 
for foreigners," because the FDM (the letter to the Supreme 
Council was signed by Kaptsov, the FDM's acting chairman) was 
undertaking to remove citizens of Ukraine as subjects of the 
privatization process. After that legislative transaction, you 
and I were left with just one option--the trust. And that is 
exactly what they are waiting for. The FDM's bureaucrats have 
faithfully kept their promise to the dealers. 
  A slightly awkward question arises. Exactly how are they 
beholden to the latter? And what about the rules of behavior of 
a state employee? In a civilized country, at any rate, merely 
publishing a bureaucrat's promises to a businessman would at 
least call for resignation and prosecution. 
  It would be hard to assess it otherwise. The SPPU warned 
owners of privatization certificates against overly trusting 
civilian intermediary agencies and trust companies, which, as we 
know, are formed primarily to make a profit. The purpose of 
PRYVATNA SPRAVA is different. It is concerned with creating the 
material base for local business in Ukraine. 
  The privatization option proposed by PRYVATNA SPRAVA calls 
for creating purchasers' partnerships all over, based on 
residence. It is this paragraph of the Law on Privatization that 
the intermediaries are against, along with the bureaucrats they 
have "recruited." The SPPU's Privatization Center is turning 
over to them a data bank of enterprises that are being 
privatized in a given locality. 
  PRYVATNA SPRAVA has never taken a single privatization 
certificate from citizens, nor does it intend to. 
  All of this completely legal activity is spelled out in the 
"Procedures for Creating and Registering Purchasers' Companies 
in the Privatization Process." The FDM and the Anti-Monopoly 
Committee should not oppose it, they should be glad that the 
privatization process is becoming available to everyone. Its 
operation is simple: citizens join together to find the most 
profitable ways to invest their privatization certificates. The 
firms help them according to the PRYVATNA SPRAVA model. They do 
not buy up vouchers directly. They have just one aim: to help 
people invest their certificates most usefully. Naturally, the 
service has to be paid for, but anyone dealing with PRYVATNA 
SPRAVA is not going to lose the main thing--the right to own the 
property he receives. 
  I don't want to name specific enterprises, although there 
are 
many of them in Kiev, but directors are now creating closed-type 
joint stock companies for themselves and then transferring 
workers to the night shift while providing no work for them. 
They are happy to sign discharge papers, because a voucher, 
according to the company charter, stays with the enterprise. And 
new workers will not be proprietors but ordinary hired labor, 
that you can do with as you will. The most far-sighted 
politicians and economists can see this. 
  When the scandalous facts of the exclusion of citizens from 
privatization became known to the press, the FDM started to 
"backpedal." The letter to the Supreme Council, they said, was 
not authorized by any Fund official. Those guilty of technical 
policy [!] have been punished. At a press conference, FDM 
Administration Chief A. Otchenash had this to say: "The girls 
typed the wrong thing." It isn't the citizens of Ukraine that 
the FDM is trying to prevent from taking part in privatization, 
as they say, but rather the purchasers' companies provided for 
by existing legislation. 
  Why is it that the purchasers' companies stick like a bone 
in 
the throat of the Fund during the privatization of state 
property? Let us recall that there are several ways to destatize 
property. 
  First, when the state itself directly undertakes the entire 
process. What that leads to, we know. Second, the process is 
undertaken by an intermediary--the trust company. Naturally, 
"XYZ promises to turn your voucher into gold." But Naftoinvest 
in Russia in bankrupt, and 500,000 citizens who entrusted their 
vouchers to it don't know what to do. The third option is to 
create a purchasers' company as provided for by law. 
  It is astonishing how newspaper journalists who pretend to 
leadership in the economic press can pour abuse on this new and 
progressive endeavor, without even taking a look at the law. If 
that is so hard to do, we repeat that the Ukrainian investment 
company PRYVATNA SPRAVA has never involved itself in any 
activity with privatization papers. And the activities of the 
SPPU's Privatization Center PRYVATNA SPRAVA have nothing to do 
with intermediary agency and are not subject to licensing. 
According to Article 6 of the Ukrainian Law on Privatization of 
the Property of State Enterprises, the following are subjects of 
privatization: state privatization agencies, purchasers, 
sellers, and intermediaries. Article 8 of that same Law states 
that the FDM "shall issue licenses to intermediaries." Article 8 
defines purchasers' companies as purchasers, and they do not 
need licenses. 
  It is hard not to agree with the comments of V. Lesin, the 
Chairman of the Kiev Chapter of the Liberal-Democratic Party of 
Ukraine, concerning this story: 
  "For three years now, the State Property Fund has been going 
through the motions of privatization while actually making it 
available only to a narrow circle of people. Of the results of 
its activities we can say confidently that it is obstructing the 
Law on Privatization.... 
  "Under these conditions, the Liberal-Democratic Party of 
Ukraine (LDPU) and the SPPU initiated mass privatization in the 
interests of all the citizens of Ukraine. The initiative was 
supported by the PRYVATNA SPRAVA company. All over Ukraine, 
including Kiev, lawful purchasers' companies began to be set up 
on the basis of residence. Their activities began to encroach 
upon the interests of certain financial groups and nomenklatura 
bureaucrats. A flood of disinformation, lies, and slander was 
launched. It took on the character of a campaign directed, 
ultimately, against the citizens of Ukraine, who want to dispose 
of their privatization certificates as they see fit, without 
intermediaries. 
  "You see, if the citizens of Ukraine become owners--that is, 
if they obtain the share of state property they have coming to 
them, then we will be living in a different kind of state where 
the main thing will be to work for oneself today rather than for 
some mythical wellbeing in the future. The Kiev Chapter of the 
LDPU vigorously protests the legislative initiative of the FDM." 
  Also very eloquent are the words of the famous economist 
Volodymyr Pylypchuk, a people's deputy to the new convocation of 
the Supreme Council. 
  A reporter asked him these questions: 
  "How do you assess the latest `legislative' initiatives of 
the FDM?" 
  "It is utter nonsense to exclude the citizens of Ukraine 
from 
privatization. The Supreme Council would not allow it. 
  "And now the bureaucrats are saying that the proposal was a 
mistake made by technical workers and are preparing a new one 
that would make purchasers' companies based on residence 
unlawful. 
  "The FDM's games are its death throes. Right now the FDM and 
the Anti-Monopoly Committee are our most passive structures. 
Compare their activities to similar ones in Russia. 
Voucher-based privatization there is nearing completion. The 
final hundred days. With us, it's the first 150 enterprises. The 
work has hardly even started. In other words, they're a pack of 
do-nothings." 
  We have to forgive this eminent politician his harsh words. 
But even the most prudent words cannot explain something that is 
incomprehensible. The head of the PRYVATNA SPRAVA chapter in 
Mykolayevo, Valentin Kryvosheyev, has been commanded by the 
local department of the FDM to have all 700 members of the 
purchasers' company report for registration; this is in conflict 
with the law. The FDM is not an organization that grants 
permission but one that registers. And, according to the law, 
its departments are supposed to register purchasers' companies 
within a 10-day period. Why isn't this being done? 
  So far, neither the FDM nor the Anti-Monopoly Committee have 
distinguished themselves by anything except abusive and illegal 
letters to the press and attempts to thwart the new endeavor by 
any means possible. And it is too important to allow it to 
drift. It is a matter, fundamentally, of the fate of Ukraine. Is 
privatization here to serve the nomenklatura or the people? Are 
we to create a class of moneybags and a mass of disenfranchised 
beggars, or are we to lay that which is the the backbone of any 
civilized society--a large stratum of small proprietors? 
  These are the most acute questions on the agenda. This is 
why 
the editors of VECHIRNIY KYYIV, true to its democratic 
traditions, intend to organize a debate of officials of the FDM, 
the Anti-Monopoly Committee, and PRYVATNA SPRAVA. Let the 
parties concerned use these pages to express their views on how 
to solve the problem which, we can say without exaggeration, 
will determine the fate of Ukraine. 
  We also invite readers to express their thoughts. Please 
write to us. We will not allow our great and long-suffering 
people to be cheated anymore.... 
  PRYVATNA SPRAVA Is Legal. The Actions of the State 
Property Fund Are in Conflict With the Constitution. 
  The Ukrainian Supreme Council Control Commission for Matters 
of Privatization has examined the FDM's representation regarding 
the activities of PRYVATNA SPRAVA with regard to the creation of 
purchasers' companies on the basis of citizens' residence. 
  The Commission has stated that the measures being taken by 
PRYVATNA SPRAVA to create purchasers' companies are not in 
conflict with Ukrainian laws on privatization. 
  A news item on this issue was submitted to the Press Service 
of the Supreme Council on 19 April 1994 by Yu. L. Kamyanin 
[surname unclear], the head of the Commission's secretariat. But 
for reasons that are unclear, the document was not made public. 
Instead, certain newspapers published FDM materials which 
groundlessly vilified PRYVATNA SPRAVA and the Union of Private 
Entrepreneurs of Ukraine. 
  The Commission also examined the FDM's proposal to exclude 
citizens of Ukraine from the list of subjects of privatization 
of state property as designated in Article 8 of the Ukraine Law 
"On the Privatization of the Property of State Enterprises." 
That proposal has been declared to be in conflict with the 
Constitution and laws of Ukraine and cannot be endorsed as a 
legislative initiative.

<F P=106> [Report by the Press Service of the President of Ukraine and </F>
Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine: "How To Stabilize Prices and 
Production"] 
  [Text] On 19 April, a session of the Presidium of the 
Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine convened under the chairmanship 
of Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy. A number of urgent 
economic issues were examined at the session. 
  In his presentation, Deputy Minister of Economics Viktor 
Kalnik provided information on the course of implementation of 
the Edict of the President of Ukraine "On Measures To Restrain 
the Rate of Price Growth." It was noted that thanks to 
implementation of the edict, which put limits on profitmaking 
levels in production and on markups in trade turnover, a certain 
degree of success was achieved in limiting the rate of growth of 
prices and, accordingly, the rate of inflation. Whereas the 
average monthly increase in wholesale prices in industry last 
year was above 146 percent, in January of this year this index 
was 123 percent, in February--116 percent, and in March--106.9 
percent. The rate of inflation in January was 19 percent, in 
February--12.6 percent, and in March--5.7 percent. For the first 
time in the past two years, price projections were confirmed 
providing a basis for planning and budgeting. These indices 
would have been much better if the sectors had standard 
regulations for calculating the producer cost of output. Through 
the fault of a number of ministries and departments, such 
regulations were not developed. Insufficient supervision on 
their part, and in some cases their connivance with violators, 
constitutes the main reason for excessive overstatement of 
producer cost of production output and wholesale factory prices. 
  Inspections conducted during the first quarter uncovered 
violations of existing price formation procedure in 58 percent 
of over 9,000 entrepreneurial activity entities inspected. 
Economic penalties were exacted from the violators amounting to 
over 260 billion karbovantsy. 
  The Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers determined 
specific 
measures for intensifying supervision and responsibility with 
respect to compliance with state price policies. Ways to perfect 
the price formation mechanism were also specified. 
  Minister of Agriculture and Foodstuffs Yuriy Karasyk 
reported 
on the status of formation and placement of state contracts and 
state orders for agricultural production output, raw materials, 
and foodstuffs in 1994. The underlying causes of complications 
in effecting timely settlements with agricultural producers were 
comprehensively analyzed. A number of measures were specified 
with respect to providing farms the resources for producing 
output sold to the state. 
  The Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers also examined 
issues related to the manufacture of automated cash registers 
and their introduction at trade enterprises, public kitchens, 
and everyday facilities. These devices significantly improve the 
supervision exercised over trade turnover and, accordingly--over 
revenue going to the budget. More than 320,000 units are 
presently required. But their rate of production at enterprises 
of the Ministry of the Machine Building Industry still does not 
conform to the standard prescribed by governmental decree. 
Additionally, automated cash registers are slow to be introduced 
in the trade sector. The Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers 
therefore adopted a resolution providing for significantly 
closer cooperation between the concerned parties in this 
question.

<F P=106> [Interview with Volodymyr Shcherbyna, chief of Object </F>
Shelter's radiation security department, by Faina Zlotnyk and 
Valentin Smaga; date and place not given: "Chernobyl 
Nuclear-Unsafe Complex, Not Protected From Lies: An Unbiased 
Commentary on Parliament's Decision To Continue Exploitation of 
Chernobyl AES"] 
  [Text] As the tragic date--another anniversary of the 
Chernobyl catastrophe--approaches, discussions intensify 
regarding whether to continue ChAES [Chernobyl Nuclear Power 
Station] exploitation. There is a lot of distortion and 
sometimes open politicking in it. Therefore, we asked for a 
commentary on this topic by a suitable and competent 
person--Volodymyr Shcherbyna, chief of Object Shelter's 
radiation security department. 
  [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Volodymyr Grigorovych, passions around 
Chernobyl do not subside. It is important, however, to discuss 
without emotion the greatest technological catastrophe in the 
history of humanity. Therefore, a question arises: Which 
criteria for appraising Chernobyl's grave problems do you 
consider most objective? 
  [Shcherbyna] In my opinion, it is protection from 
radiation--the science that provides the ability to optimally 
calculate the scientific-technical, techno-economical, 
medical-biological, and sociopsychological aspects of current 
and future Chernobyl problems. 
  Note this: In the decree "On Some Measures for Providing the 
Economy With Electric Power" the previous parliament apparently 
is not revoking its decision, just agreeing with the Cabinet of 
Ministers proposal to continue ChAES exploitation, but only 
under the supervision of the Derzhatomnaglyad [State Oversight 
Committee for Nuclear and Radiation Safety], Minpriroda 
[Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources], 
and the Academy of Sciences. In my opinion, this is a way to 
shirk personal responsibility, as old as the world--when there 
are so many oversight organizations, you never find who is 
directly responsible. 
  The decision to continue the station's exploitation does not 
remove in any way from the agenda the grave questions that were 
pertinent at the time it was taken off line. I will enumerate 
only some of them. 
  First, the level of ChAES safety is substantially lower than 
what is required by international and national standards, or the 
radiation environment requirements that have developed in 
Ukraine as a result of the Chernobyl catastrophe, and because of 
both the design and the technological capabilities of the power 
generators, and because an almost complete absence of nuclear 
power generation infrastructure in Ukraine cannot be improved in 
any substantial way. 
  Second, the radiation-ecological and psychological blows 
Ukraine sustained from both the Chernobyl catastrophe and its 
consequences have caused a strong nonacceptance of continuation 
of ChAES exploitation among a great majority of the Ukrainian 
population. 
  Third, the international public opinion of many countries, 
especially those that have been seriously affected by the 
Chernobyl catastrophe, cannot understand why they have to put up 
with continuing exploitation of ChAES, which already has 
inflicted such damage on the humanity and ecology of Earth. 
  And fourth, the state of Ukrainian economy at the time of 
adopting this decision include sources of energy that make it 
possible, essentially without significant expenditures, to take 
out of exploitation ChAES power generators. 
  The decision to activate ChAES has not changed an iota any 
of 
these points. 
  [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] As far as we remember, the writer, who was 
the head of the parliamentary commission on the questions of 
Chernobyl catastrophe at the time of the hearings asked 
directly: What about competent guarantees of AES' safe 
exploitation? 
  [Shcherbyna] I remember--and think about what he was told: 
Since, according to Derzhatomnaglyad, all Ukrainian nuclear 
power stations meet neither international nor national safety 
standards, discussing this issue with respect to ChAES is 
meaningless. And we should mention that from the standpoint of 
departmental sense the answer is irreproachable. Except that the 
person who brought up this question was interested not in the 
problem of how logical this information looked to 
Derzhatomnaglyad, but the problem of the future of the Ukrainian 
people and environment. 
  [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] So what is actually the real level of 
ChAES 
safety? 
  [Shcherbyna] First, remember for starters that it is 
different from other stations equipped with RBMK's [high-power 
pressurized tube reactors]. The ChAES is an indissoluble "No. 3 
generator" complex--the nuclear-unsafe and radiation-unsafe 
Object Shelter, which technically is in a condemned condition. 
That is, what is called the Chernobyl Nuclear-Unsafe Complex 
(ChYaNK). Next: the equipment and engineering structures, which 
as a consequence of the 1986 tragedy have suffered to a greater 
or lesser extent from the overload not foreseen by the design. 
The station represents "harder" conditions for the work of all 
enterprise services, as well as the staff as a whole. And one 
more special feature: arranging the main location of service 
personnel at a considerable distance (50 km) from the station, 
beyond the boundary of ChAES radiation effect. 
  According to the main normative document currently in 
effect--OPB-88, the nuclear station's safety is ensured by 
implementing the principle of depth-distributed protection. This 
principle consists of 13 components. With respect to ChAES, of 
these 13 components only one-quarter have been carried out, 
while three-quarters have not been put in place either at all or 
in part. 
  This normative document also establishes an integrated 
indicator of nuclear station safety. It is expressed by the 
value of the maximum emergency discharges of radioactive 
material surrounding the core. This value is set at the level of 
one event per year per 10 million operating power generating 
units of AES. For the ChAES this indicator is 10,000 times 
higher. 
  [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] However, the top officials of Derzhkomatom 
[State Committee on Atomic Energy] and the ChAES maintain that 
the target level of safety has been achieved. 
  [Shcherbyna] This is not quite correct. Let us look at the 
significance and substantiation of these arguments. The main 
technical measures that are being taken in order to avoid the 
repetition of the 1986 accident were predicated on precluding 
the introduction of positive reactivity. At the same time, the 
chief designer organization of the RBMK-1000 in its "Generalized 
Analysis of the Accident at the ChAES No. 4 Generator. Report 
13.168" produced this conclusion: "Having considered the 
formulated requirements for modeling all known information 
received in the NDKIET [expansion not identified], IAE [Atomic 
Energy Institute], VNDIAES [All-Ukraine Institute for Nuclear 
Power Stations Research], and the IYaD AN URSR [Nuclear Research 
Institute of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences] from the results 
of various three-dimensional programs, one may ascertain that 
for the simulated re-creation of the accidental reactor runaway 
the surge of positive reactivity alone in the A3-5 combination 
is not sufficient and requires development of different 
hypotheses." 
  Most foreign specialists support this viewpoint. Although 
since the initial facts of the 1986 accident have not been 
determined, we cannot maintain with certainty that the 1986 
accident will not be repeated. And even less so can we maintain 
this about accidents of a different kind that have similar or 
greater radiation consequences. 
  This conclusion is convincingly supported by many 
specialists 
both in our country and abroad, including in numerous papers 
presented at the symposium on the problems of ChAES held in Kiev 
in May 1993. 
  One of the most interesting presentations at that symposium 
(delivered by a representative of the Austrian green movement) 
showed, in more technical depth and with more argumentation than 
in the presentations of the top officials of Derzhkomatom and 
ChAES, that the level of safety of the ChAES does not correspond 
to any measurements of the international community. 
  I want to repeat: From the standpoint of ensuring 
safety, the parliament decision to continue exploitation of 
ChAES legitimized the transformation of ChAES into the Chernobyl 
Nuclear-Unsafe Station (ChYaNS), the central link of which is 
the Chernobyl nuclear-unsafe complex Object Shelter--No. 3 
generator. 
  Behind this move of ChAES into a ChYaNS category is not just 
the change of initials; behind it is the demonstration of the 
Derzhkomatom's will and its stubborn conviction that there are 
things that are more important than a repetition of an accident 
of Chernobyl proportions in Ukraine. 
  [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Thus, are you against development of 
nuclear power generation? 
  [Shcherbyna] Not at all. I believe that humanity can go 
ahead 
with the development of nuclear power generation but only to the 
extent to which it is possible to ensure that its benefits 
outweigh the harm. And that the relationship "benefit--harm" in 
the nuclear power generation should be seen not only from the 
viewpoint of... interests, but after evaluation of short-term 
and long-terms prospects. 
  These problems face both humanity as a whole and each 
country 
separately. 
  Unfortunately, methodological tools developed by world 
science for calculation of "benefit--harm" ratio in nuclear 
power generation cannot yet provide answers to all questions 
arising in this sphere. Much in this we still have to work out 
by the method of trial and error, including the road of "public 
choice" with respect to the level of risk in nuclear power 
generation. 
  It so happens that in Ukraine many nuclear professionals are 
convinced that because of the complexity and, most importantly, 
uncertainty of the methods of evaluation of "benefit--harm" 
ratio in nuclear power generation, it is not advisable to bring 
into this issue the general public and even less so to provide 
it with that part of information with respect to which they 
themselves have great doubts. And if circumstances force us to 
speak on this topic, we should do it in such a way that society 
would "understand us correctly." 
  The Chernobyl catastrophe has graphically demonstrated all 
the harm of "measured truth" on ChAES safety. It is good that 
some of us are opening our eyes. And there are more people like 
this day by day... 
  [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Your eyes have opened; however, you are a 
specialist... What do we do about many of our public movements, 
which reject from the outset nuclear power generation, equating 
all of it with Chernobyl? 
  [Shcherbyna] We need to tell the truth. And the most acute 
issues are these: 
  1. What is the total damage the Chernobyl catastrophe has 
produced and continues to produce? 
  2. With the help of what measures and at what cost can the 
damage caused by the Chernobyl catastrophe for Ukraine be 
liquidated or at least neutralized to an "acceptable level?" 
  3. What is the probability of an accident on the scale of 
Chernobyl-1986 repeating itself at the ChAES and where will it 
put Ukraine this time? 
  And nobody should have any doubt that until the public gets 
the answer to these questions, it will "by all means available 
to it" resist continuation of exploitation of the ChAES. Until 
then, the ChAES is practically the only nuclear station in the 
world that has realized in practice even those negative sides of 
nuclear power generations that remain a "possibility" for the 
rest of AES. 
  Let us look for example in what minimum acceptable form an 
answer may be provided to the first question. We need to first 
of all evaluate these factors: What is the degree of harm the 
Chernobyl catastrophe has produced for the health of the future 
generations of Ukrainian citizens; what part of the 
radio-ecological tolerance of the Ukrainian environment has been 
used up by the Chernobyl catastrophe; and what damage has the 
Chernobyl catastrophe of 1986 done to the health of the current 
generation? 
  And the more we delay obtaining scientifically substantiated 
answers to these questions, the more conservative our society 
becomes in the appraisal of the consequences of Chernobyl 
catastrophe and nuclear power generation as a whole. 
  In these conditions any consideration of the problem of 
continuing exploitation of ChAES without at the same time 
discussing these questions produces an outcry about "disrespect 
for public opinion." 
  Whether we discuss the problem openly or sweep it under the 
rug, people see with their own eyes the increase in the number 
of children who got sick as a result of the Chernobyl 
catastrophe, the increase in the number of sick and disabled as 
a result of the work on the liquidation of the consequences of 
the Chernobyl accident and the work on continuing exploitation 
of ChAES. 
  They see the devastation and destruction of a part of their 
land, the international isolation of Ukraine as a result of its 
insistent refusal to hold back exploitation of ChAES, and many 
other things. 
  Moreover, the "service record of ChAES accident-proneness" 
is 
such that it forces one to re-doubt suspicions regarding 
everything that is connected one way or the other with the 
Chernobyl nuclear power station. Really, let us read and think 
about it: 
  1983--radiation accident. 
  1986--radiation catastrophe. 
  1988--"disintegration" of the power generation system. 
  1990--critical accident at the Object Shelter. 
  1991--fire at No. 3 generator. 
  1993--fire at the Object Shelter. 
  1993--disappearance of nuclear fuel... 
  [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] But we were told all the time that we 
would 
freeze without ChAES. 
  [Shcherbyna] All right, let us talk about power generation 
with figures in hand. Compare at least two of them. ChAES 
accounts for 4 to 6 percent of total electric power output in 
Ukraine. According to the Ministry of Energy's own data, there 
is no demand for 33 percent of all power generation capability 
in Ukraine today. 
  Add to this the 30-percent reserve of power generation 
capability. If we put on line only half of them, buying organic 
fuel for this purpose for an amount equivalent to $600 million 
worth a year, we will produce $1.5 billion worth of electric 
power by "Derzhkomatom estimates." By that we not only 
compensate for the cost associated with taking ChAES off line, 
but even make a substantial profit in the dollar equivalent. 
  [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Still, let us say that the Cabinet of 
Ministers had serious reasons for believing that without ChAES 
it will not fulfill its obligation to the country. And for this 
reason it asked parliament to permit continuing exploitation of 
the station. But what does it mean: "to continue exploitation of 
ChAES for the period warranted by its technical condition"? 
  [Shcherbyna] Formally it means that we cannot "adhere to the 
rated capacity" of nuclear power stations whose technical 
conditions do not meet normative requirements. However, as the 
Derzhatomnaglyad reported, ChAES did not meet established norms 
before, or ever for that matter. 
  This inconsistency may be resolved in only one way--by 
assuming that parliament's decision applies not to the entire 
technical condition of the station but only such, one would 
assume, "most critical parameters." In this case the decision 
should have said who is to set these "most critical parameters" 
for ChAES. The station itself, as a self-operating organization, 
or a higher body, and as Derzhkomatom, Derzhatomnaglyad, or some 
other? It would be most logical to admit that this can be done 
by the Cabinet of Minister, since it was this body that asked 
parliament to continue work on capacity of ChAES. 
  Next. What does this mean: "ChAES exploitation is conducted 
under the oversight of Derzhatomnaglyad, Minpriroda, and the 
Academy of Sciences." A new institute is being set up--the 
institute for watching over ChAES exploitation. But what does it 
mean? What is its status? What are its responsibilities? 
  But the main point is still something else. The main point 
is: Why do we need to make this an observer institute? Both 
Derzhatomnaglyad and Minpriroda have extensive oversight 
functions with respect to ChAES, as well as any other AES in 
Ukraine. Moving these organizations from the category of 
oversight bodies into the category of observers at first glance 
does not make any sense for the Cabinet of Ministers, because it 
considerably cuts their rights regarding ChAES, as well as their 
responsibility for ChAES safety. 
  Really, what does this decree make Derzhatomnaglyad with 
respect to ChAES? Essentially, into a "State Committee for 
Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety of ChAES." The same 
applies to Minpriroda. 
  Perhaps, it stems from our long-standing habit that 
collective responsibility (the synonym for the lack of 
individual responsibility) begins where there are no less than 
three participants, which explains adding the Ukrainian Academy 
of Sciences. 
  The Ukrainian Academy of Sciences is not set either by its 
substance or its structure to carry out the tasks of 
departmental science. Hence, its inclusion in the ChAES problem 
in the role of "observer" over the safe exploitation of the 
stations means only one thing: The Academy of Sciences' task is 
to warn in good time all other organizations interested in this 
problem that from such and such point in time the technical base 
of ChAES precludes the ability to be safely exploited and 
therefore the station needs to be closed. 
  Perhaps for the first time in the history of all science 
organizations and institutions in the world the Ukrainian 
Academy of Sciences is tasked with overseeing the safety of an 
individual enterprise with about 7,000 employees. This is an 
unprecedented instance in the history of world science. 
  [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Perhaps the authority of the Ukrainian 
Academy of Sciences simply will deflect harsh criticism 
currently aimed at Derzhkomatom? 
  [Shcherbyna] Well, the Derzhkomatom needs not only help, but 
complete and unconditional help in this issue, which is, 
generally speaking, secondary for the Ukrainian nuclear power 
generation as a whole. This is something to think about for 
everyone: parliament members, voters, and officials in the 
executive power structures. 
  Our country's nuclear power generation sector is at the 
earliest stage of its independent development. And therefore all 
serious decisions set a precedent. Also, as we know from 
history, it is easier to make a precedent a practice than to 
root it out of practice. Hence, essentially this decision is 
equivalent to an admission that in Ukraine there are matters 
more important than the ensuring nonrepetition of the Chernobyl 
catastrophe... 
  [VECHIRNIY KYYIV] Will not, perhaps, our descendants find 
such "conclusions" criminal? 
  [Shcherbyna] I hope we ourselves will not come to the point 
seeing it that way.

<F P=106> [Interview with L. Pavlikova, deputy economics minister of </F>
Ukraine, by T. Mayboroda; place and date not given: "The 
Invisible Being Acquires a Face or the Deposit Privatization 
Certificate Becomes a Paper Voucher"] 
  [Text] There is not long to wait: in another three to four 
months the citizens of Ukraine, just as the Russians at one 
time, will get vouchers--privatization papers which will be 
simpler for them to handle than special-purpose savings bank 
deposit accounts in becoming owners of an appropriate share of 
state property. The Ukrainian variant of the voucher is a type 
of coupon which can be exchanged directly for shares in the 
desired subject of privatization or a privatization 
intermediary-investor who guarantees you decent dividends. 
  Such intermediaries have already appeared in our country and 
their numbers will grow together with the competition, on the 
crest of which potential investors will, naturally, make all 
manner of promises. In such a situation, dear fellow citizens, 
you must try not to make a bad deal, listen carefully, delve 
into every detail, first becoming acquainted with the economic 
file of the enterprise whose shares you decide to acquire in 
return for the vouchers or of the intermediary to whom you 
decided to entrust their investment. We requested Lada 
Pavlikovskskaya, deputy economics minister of Ukraine to explain 
certain aspects of the forthcoming "voucherization". 
  [Mayboroda] Lada Anatolyevna, everyone knows that in Russia 
it was possible to sell the vouchers, exchange them for 
something, give them as a gift, and so on. Why will that be 
impossible in Ukraine? 
  [Pavlikovskaya] Practice has indicated the low effectiveness 
of such a "primary" securities market. In addition to that this 
required quite a lot of time. That is why we decided not to 
release the voucher on the market. This privatization paper in 
itself will not be the subject of purchase or sale, but, 
exchanging it into shares, the citizen will be able to dispose 
of it as he sees fit--sell them, give them as gifts, or exchange 
them. 
  [Mayboroda] The editor receives many letters complaining 
about the supposedly very low nominal value of our property 
certificate--the voucher. It is impossible to purchase very much 
both for its initial price--30,000 karbovantsy or its current 
price which is slightly over a million. 
  [Pavlikovskaya] Yes, I am aware of that widespread 
misconception. One, however, should not equate the nominal value 
of the voucher with its real price on the market. The figure 
designated on it is merely a part (in valuational expression for 
a certain period) of the 70 percent of state property subject to 
privatization, amounting to the share of each citizen of 
Ukraine. On the securities market, under favorable conditions, 
it will be possible to obtain shares for the voucher the real 
price of which will possibly be measured in more than one 
million karbovantsy. 
  [Mayboroda] Will it be possible to invest one's voucher in 
housing? 
  [Pavlikovskaya] We provided for the possibility of 
converting 
a privatization certificate and a housing check. Three 
concurrent types of securities were envisioned for the country: 
a certificate for privatization of state enterprises, a check 
for privatization of housing and a bond for land privatization. 
We now have two types of securities and they exist in the form 
of the deposit account. The privatization certificate--1,000,050 
karbovantsy and the housing check--12,000 karbovantsy. It is 
true a problem did occur which we are yet to resolve--the 
"weight" of the nonindexed housing check proved to be less than 
that of the certificate by a factor of almost a hundred. 
Therefore I would advise waiting until the problem with 
indexation is resolved which will be accomplished in the very 
near future. As far as the land bond is concerned, that issue, 
in principle, remains open because the mechanism for mass-scale 
privatization of land has not yet been worked out by Ukrainian 
legislators. 
  [Mayboroda] In Russia vouchers were in circulation for quite 
a long period. In June of this year their acceptance from 
citizens is coming to an end, according to available 
information. What sort of deadlines are we going to have? 
  [Pavlikovskaya] In accordance with the privatization program 
the certificate expires in 1994. A few days ago, however, a 
decree of the president of Ukraine was published concerning the 
introduction of privatization property certificates into 
circulation, in accordance with which prior to 31 January 1995 
citizens will be able to use both the noncash deposit accounts 
and the cash property certificates, and then, after 31 December 
1996, only the cash vouchers. 
  By the way, many of our countrymen have already utilized 
their privatization accounts in the Savings Bank. A new list of 
150 enterprises being privatized was published recently. 
Therefore for those who have already made their selection, there 
is no need at all to wait for the appearance of the paper 
voucher. 
  [Mayboroda] We make frequent use of the market experience 
gained by Russia. It would be good to learn more often from the 
mistakes of others and not our own. Have our economists 
extracted certain lessons from voucher privatization conducted 
by the neighbors? 
  [Pavlikovskaya] Recently a group of Ukrainian specialists of 
the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Economy, the State 
Property Fund, and the Savings Bank visited Moscow and Syktyvkar 
specifically for the purpose of familiarizing themselves with 
the massive privatization at the center and in various regions 
of Russia. 
  We noted a sufficiently successful coordination of these 
processes and good organization in the conduct of auctions. I 
think that the check auction centers, and centers for acceptance 
of bids from citizens and sale of shares are in essence being 
organized by us as well. 
  We intend to improve the computer network, however, by 
comparison with the Russian one. All-Russia auctions are 
currently under way in Moscow where shares of industrial giants 
are offered for sale. Bids for these shares arrive from the 
periphery whereas residents in the capital take practically no 
interest in regional sales. 
  If possible we would like to allow a resident, for instance, 
of Odessa to effectively participate in an auction conducted in 
Lvov or Donetsk through the computer network. 
  [Mayboroda] That would be an expensive luxury. 
  [Pavlikovskaya] Yes. Such a network would not be cheap. We 
are however, counting on the support and technical assistance of 
the American Development Agency which, by the way, is already 
helping us with the production of cash vouchers.

<F P=106> [Text, under the rubric "Documents," of Statute on State </F>
Registration of Subjects of Entrepreneurial Activity, ratified 
by the Cabinet of Ministers Decree No 276 of 29 April 1994] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  I. General Part </H5>
  1. This Statute defines the procedure for state registration 
and reregistration of subjects of entrepreneurial activity, 
regardless of their organizational forms and forms of ownership, 
with the exception of certain types of subjects of 
entrepreneurship (banks, mass information media, stock 
exchanges, and others) for which legislative enactments of 
Ukraine have established special rules of state registration. 
  2. State registration of subjects of entrepreneurial 
activity 
is done at the executive committee of the city or urban rayon 
soviet of people's deputies or in the rayon or urban rayon 
administration of the cities of Kiev and Sevastopol at their 
location (place of residence). 
  3. The location of a subject of entrepreneurial activity 
which is a legal entity is considered the location (siting) of 
its permanent management organ (governing board, board of 
directors, and others). 
  The place of residence of a citizen-entrepreneur is the 
permanent place of residence registered following established 
procedures. 
<H5>  II. State Registration of Subjects of Entrepreneurial </H5>
Activity 
  4. For state registration of a subject of entrepreneurial 
activity which is a legal entity, the owner (or owners) or the 
person (petitioner) authorized by him (or them) submits the 
following to the state registration organ: 
  a) the charter documents: 
  the decision of the owner of the property or the organ 
authorized by him to create the subject of entrepreneurial 
activity. If there are two or more owners or organs authorized 
by them, the charter agreement is this document; 
  the charter (if this is necessary for the organizational 
form of the subject of entrepreneurship being created); 
  b) the registration card; 
  c) the document certifying payment of the registration fee. 
  In the event a private enterprise is registered, the owner's 
decision is not submitted. 
  If the owner (or one of the owners) of the subject of 
entrepreneurial activity is a legal entity, a notarized copy of 
the certificate of state registration of this legal entity is 
submitted in addition. 
  A foreign legal entity submits the document certifying its 
registration in the country of location (an excerpt from the 
trade, bank, or judicial register, and others). This document 
must be notarized at the place it was issued, translated into 
the Ukrainian language, and legalized at a Ukrainian consular 
institution, unless otherwise envisioned by international 
treaties in which Ukraine takes part. This document may also be 
certified at the embassy of the corresponding state in Ukraine 
and legalized at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. 
  In the event physical persons are the owners of the subject 
of entrepreneurial activity, their signatures on the charter 
documents must be notarized. 
  5. The originals of the charter documents are submitted to 
conduct the registration. 
  Charter documents must not contain provisions which 
contradict existing legislation. 
  The petitioner bears responsibility for the charter 
documents' conformance with existing legislation. 
  6. The charter documents are compiled in the official or 
other language in accordance with Article 11 of the UkSSR Law 
"On Languages in the Ukrainian SSR" and are signed by the 
petitioner, perforated, and numbered. 
  7. A citizen who has the intention of conducting 
entrepreneurial activity without creating a legal entity (the 
petitioner) submits the registration card and the document 
certifying payment of the registration fee to the state 
registration organ and also submits a document certifying his 
identity. 
  8. The registration card is filled out in three copies (in 
addition to the identification code) and signed by the 
petitioner. The completed registration card is at the same time 
the petition for state registration. 
  The state registration organ when necessary offers the 
petitioner help in filling out the card. The petitioner is 
responsible for making sure the information on the registration 
card is correct. 
  9. The state registration organ does not have the right to 
demand other documents from the petitioner and documents filled 
out according to requirements different from those defined in 
this Statute or that the charter documents be reconciled with 
the organs of state executive power or other organs. 
  10. The state registration organ records the date the 
documents are received. 
  When all documents indicated in points 4 and 7 of this 
Statute are received, within five working days the state 
registration organ is obliged to conduct the state registration 
of the subject of entrepreneurial activity and issue the 
petitioner a certificate as shown in the model in the appendix. 
  11. The number of the state registration certificate of the 
subject of entrepreneurial activity must correspond to the 
identification code by which this subject is included in the 
State Register of Reporting Statistical Units. 
  The certificate of state registration is the only document 
which gives the subject of entrepreneurial activity the right to 
open current, foreign currency, and other accounts in banking 
institutions and to produce seals and stamps. 
  The number of the state registration certificate of the 
subject of entrepreneurial activity must be shown on the seals 
and stamps. 
  12. Within 10 days from the day of state registration of the 
subject of entrepreneurial activity, the state registration 
organ is obliged to submit one copy of the registration card to 
the appropriate state tax inspection office and one to the state 
statistics organ. 
  13. Branches (divisions) and offices created by a subject of 
entrepreneurial activity do not require state registration. The 
subject of entrepreneurial activity informs the state 
registration organ of the creation of these subdivisions by 
inserting the corresponding information on his registration card. 
  14. The state registration organ keeps a record of the 
subjects of entrepreneurial activity starting from the date of 
registration or the date of appeal to the state registration 
organ at the new location in accordance with Point 23 of this 
Statute. 
<H5>  III. Reregistration of Subjects of Entrepreneurial Activity </H5>
  15. Reregistration of subjects of entrepreneurial activity 
is 
handled in the manner established for their registration. 
  16. Reregistration is done if the name of the subject of 
entrepreneurial activity is changed; 
  if the form of ownership is changed; 
  \ if the organizational form of the subject of 
entrepreneurial activity is changed. 
  17. In the event the owner (or owners) of the subject of 
entrepreneurial activity is changed, assuming this did not 
result in the form of ownership changing, reregistration does 
not take place. 
<H5>  IV. Making Changes (or Additions) to the Charter Documents </H5>
  18. Changes (or additions) to the charter documents are made 
official by individual appendices to it or by putting them in a 
new edition while complying with the requirements defined by 
points 4-6 of this Statute. 
  19. In the event changes (or additions) related to a change 
in the name, form of ownership, or organizational form of the 
subject of entrepreneurial activity are made, it is reregistered 
following procedures envisioned by this Statute. 
  20. In the event changes (or additions) which do not require 
reregistration of the subject of entrepreneurial activity but 
involve the need to make changes (or additions) to the 
registration card are made to the charter documents, within 10 
days from the day the decision is made to make these changes (or 
additions), the petitioner must submit one copy, notarized 
following established procedures, of each of the copies of the 
documents in which these changes (or additions) are shown to the 
state registration organ and enter them on his registration card. 
  If these changes (or additions) are significant in scope, 
the 
petitioner fills out a new registration card blank in three 
copies after putting his identification code by which the 
subject of entrepreneurial activity is included in the State 
Register of Reporting Statistical Units on it. Only the 
information on which the changes (or additions) were made is 
cited on the new blank. The petitioner crosses out the outdated 
information on the registration card filled out before and 
affixes his signature. 
  Within 10 days of the day these documents are received, the 
state registration organ in writing informs the appropriate 
state tax inspection office and the state statistics organ of 
the changes (or additions) made. 
<H5>  V. A Change in the Location (or Place of Residence) by the </H5>
Subject of Entrepreneurial Activity 
  21. When the location (or place of residence) is changed, 
within 7 days of the day this change is made, the subject of 
entrepreneurial activity must do the following: 
  in writing inform the state registration organ of the new 
location (or place of residence). Failing to fulfill this 
requirement within the time period indicated is grounds for the 
state registration organ to go to court or arbitration court and 
ask for cancellation of the state registration; 
  make the corresponding changes in his registration card; 
  submit a certificate of state registration for making 
these changes. 
  22. The state registration organ does the following: 
  makes changes in the certificate of state registration of 
the subject of entrepreneurial activity in which the date the 
change was made and his new location (or place of residence) are 
indicated. The information inserted is signed by the authorized 
official and made official with the seal; 
  within 10 days of the day notification of the change in 
location (or place of residence) of the subject of 
entrepreneurial activity is received informs the appropriate tax 
inspection office and the state statistics organ of this in 
writing. 
  23. In the event a change is made in the location (or place 
of residence) of the subject of entrepreneurial activity which 
is related to a change in the administrative rayon (or city), 
within 10 days the state registration organ sends the 
registration card to the state registration organ at the new 
location (or place of residence) of this subject. 
  Within 30 days from the day the location (or place of 
residence) changes, the subject of entrepreneurial activity is 
obliged to appeal to the state registration organ at the new 
location (or place of residence) to be put on their rolls. 
  Within 10 days, the state registration organ at the new 
location (or place of residence) of the subject of 
entrepreneurial activity informs the appropriate state tax 
inspection office and state statistics organ in writing of the 
acceptance of this subject of entrepreneurship on the rolls and 
his new location (or place of residence).

on the basis of a decision of the court or arbitration court in 
the following cases: 
  the charter documents are declared to be invalid or 
conflicting with existing legislation; 
  carrying on activity which contradicts the charter 
documents and existing legislation; 
  the failure of the subject of entrepreneurial activity to

<F P=106> [Interview with F. T. Sarkisyan, president of Armenian </F>
National Academy of Sciences, by Z. Arevshatyan: "Academy of 
Sciences 50 Years Old"] 
  [Text] "The most urgent cultural-historical task of 
the Armenian Academy is raising the self-awareness of the 
Armenian people . . . developing in them a conscious love for 
their homeland, language, and culture and strengthening their 
faith in a bright future. The Academy should be an object of 
pride for our people. It should become the acme of our culture," 
said Avetik Isaakyan at a ceremonial gathering dedicated to the 
inauguration of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian SSR. 
Since then, 50 years have passed, and during these spring days 
we are marking the half-century anniversary of what is now the 
Armenian National Academy of Sciences [NAN]. The history of its 
creation, the people thanks to whose scientific activity Armenia 
today is and always will take a place of honor in the world of 
science not only of the former USSR but of the world, and also 
the present day of the NAN will be the subject of our 
conversation with its president, Fadey Tachatovich 
Sarkisyan. 
  [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] An anniversary is always an occasion 
for remembering the founders once again, for looking back on the 
past from the standpoint of that constructive charge that it 
nonetheless bore, thanks to vivid, outstanding individuals. 
  [Sarkisyan] To be precise, our reckoning should begin with 
1935, when at the initiative of the USSR Academy of Sciences, a 
branch of it was created in Yerevan, headed by the famous 
geologist and scholar, Academician F. Yu. Levinson-Lesing. In 
1938, the outstanding academician Iosif Orbeli took over the 
leadership of this scientific institution. Its obvious successes 
and the high level of its scientific personnel made it obvious 
that an independent academy of sciences should be created in 
Armenia. In November 1943, a founding council of 23 academicians 
was approved. Here are the names of these outstanding scholars: 
Manuk Abegyan (literary criticism), Abraam Alikhanyan (physics), 
Artem Alikhanyan (physics), Pachiya Acharyan (linguistics), 
Vardan Gulkanyan (genetics), Ivan Yegiazarov (hydroenergy), 
Mikayel Tumanyan (agriculture), Avetik Isaakyan (literature), 
Saak Karapetyan (physiology), Khachatur Koshtoyants 
(physiology), Aleksandr Akopyan (thermodynamics), Viktor 
Ambartsumyan (astrophysics), Levon Ovanisyan (medicine), Gongor 
Kapandzhyan (linguistics), Stepan Malkhasyan (philology), Akop 
Manandyan (history), Konstantin Paffengolts (geology), Arsin 
Terteryan (literary criticism), Iosif Orbeli [illegible], Levon 
Orbeli (physiology). 
  Iosif Orbeli was elected the first president of our academy; 
the vice-presidents were Viktor Ambartsumyan and Vardan 
Gulkanyan. 
  During the difficult days of the war, specifically on 29 
November 1943, the ceremonial opening of the Armenian Academy of 
Sciences was held. 
  The year 1947 also became a notable landmark in the history 
of our academy, when it was newly headed up by and in the course 
of 46 years had as its constant president Viktor Ambartsumyan. 
Under his leadership the Armenian Academy of Sciences was 
formed, following a fruitful scientific path of development and 
receiving world recognition in several spheres of science. Today 
Viktor Amazaspovich, as NAN's honorary president, is taking an 
active part in the Academy's activities. 
  [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] So, in the first year of the academy's 
creation, its 23 members decided the basic path of its 
development. And since at an anniversary you are supposed to sum 
up specific results, what scientific potential does the NAN 
possess today in figures? 
  [Sarkisyan] Over the last 50 years, the Academy has held 19 
elections and elected a total of 103 active members and 161 
corresponding members of the Academy, as well as 13 honorary and 
24 foreign members of the Academy. 
  At present the NAN has 38 active, 63 corresponding, 10 
honorary, and 19 foreign members. Of our 2685 scientific 
associates, 302 are doctors of science and 1385 are candidates 
of science. 
  [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] Every era has its own demands: 
literally two years ago the issue was raised about the need to 
reorganize the academy, its structure and activities. Was an 
optimal solution found? After all, it is no secret that because 
of the uncertainty of these issues, as well as the difficult 
social and economic situation, which does not allow for 
full-fledged professional activity, the republic's scientific 
potential is decreasing. 
  [Sarkisyan] Actually, there have been many disputes and 
discussions, and acceptable and unacceptable proposals have been 
advanced on this subject. And this has happened because under 
the new conditions, which have posed the Academy with the 
necessity to refurbish its approach to many branches of 
knowledge, the Academy's new status has not been approved. 
  [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] The president's edict of 9 March 1993, 
"On the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Armenia," changed 
the status of the Academy and the attitude toward it in a 
fundamental way, thereby preparing a basis for the further 
development of our country's science. In accordance with the 
edict, the Academy was renamed the RA [Republic of Armenia] 
National Academy of Sciences , which, in the first place, 
distinguishes it in principle from other academies that have 
opened lately in Armenia. In the second place, the Academy's 
role and importance have grown significantly: it is now an 
advisor to the leading organs of the republic, and its 
recommendations must be considered by the government, with the 
issue of specific decisions. 
  On 2 May of this year, the RA government approved the new 
NAN 
charter, which was passed recently at its general assembly. In 
it the provisions guaranteeing the monolithic nature of the 
academic structure, specifying the mechanisms for financing 
scientific work, and significantly raising and specifying the 
roles and tasks of the NAN in our complex age were reinforced.

<F P=106> [Comments by Larisa Alaverdyan, principal expert of the </F>
Special Artsakh Commission of the Supreme Council of the 
Republic of Armenia, recorded by M. Grigoryan: "`Azerbaijan Is 
Not Ready for Peace'"] 
  [Text] May has been unusually rich in all kinds of 
peacemaking initiatives and meetings and documents on the 
Karabakh conflict. It is now clear to everyone that Russia has a 
firm grip on all the "reins" of the mediation process and is 
single-mindedly and methodically attempting to bring the parties 
to the common denominator that it has devised. It is just as 
obvious, however, that this process is proving extremely 
painful, and this is not surprising, considering the neglect and 
intricacy of the Karabakh knot. 
  Many people called the last meeting in Moscow at the 
foreign minister level a most decisive step toward peace. It is 
as yet somewhat too early to be talking about peace, I believe; 
nonetheless, certain trends in the development of events may be 
traced quite clearly. 
  At the paper's request, Larisa Alaverdyan, principal 
expert of the Special Artsakh Commission of the Supreme Council 
of the Republic of Armenia, expresses her viewpoint. 
  We have witnessed one further latest stage of the 
peacemaking 
process on the Karabakh problem. There have been sufficient 
commentaries in the press in this connection, and everything has 
been said, it would seem. But, perusing the press, one odd 
circumstance may be observed: The process is described in highly 
positive terms, whereas it ended very unsuccessfully, to put it 
mildly. It is a question of the fact that we achieved 
recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to the conflict at 
quite a high price: First, Armenia also was, essentially, 
recognized as a "party," and, second, Azerbaijan, it transpires, 
no longer now recognizes itself a "party." Thus the situation 
concerning the subjects of the conflict is once again uncertain. 
Despite the well-known statement of Guliyev, head of the 
National Assembly, to the effect that it would appear to be time 
to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to the conflict if only 
to have "someone to hold to account," the mood in Azerbaijan has 
not changed one iota. It seems to me more important, therefore, 
to comment not on the document itself, which was never signed by 
Azerbaijan, but to view events from a somewhat different, but 
closely connected, viewpoint. 
  For the peacemaking process to become a reality and for any 
agreement to be converted from paper into actual action the 
consent and readiness of all parties--recognized and 
unrecognized--are essential as preconditions. This is an 
entirely objective condition: They must all be ready for peace. 
Unfortunately, all that we are observing in Azerbaijan--the 
press, broadcasting, statements of officials, up to and 
including the largely strange fuss in the National Assembly 
apropos Bishkek--in a word, the political aura in this country 
and the atmosphere and ideology testify that Azerbaijan is not 
ready for peace. And this applies not only to the "top," what is 
more--a certain stratum in society that shares in their entirety 
the views of political leaders is emerging. Azerbaijan was 
formerly not ready for any compromise even while part of the 
USSR, although there are more than 30 known instances of 
agreements having been achieved on issues identical to the level 
of the Karabakh conflict at that time. Nor was Azerbaijan ready 
for the start of the war, but started it. It is fitting to 
recall here, incidentally, that the war began under Mutalibov, 
with whom many people are today linking their hopes that with a 
change of regime in Baku there will be change in policy also. 
  Now, however, this country is not ready for peace. It has 
regretfully to be stated that all that is happening currently on 
the Karabakh front is merely a precursor of a big war, plans for 
which are, evidently, being hatched by Azerbaijan's political 
leadership. Only a radical change not only of the leader but of 
the entire leading stratum and a change in official ideology 
could give us hope of peace. Otherwise, it will be difficult to 
hope for anything, however zealously we express our aspiration 
for peace negotiations and a readiness to sign any document. 
Yes, there are in these documents clauses that are unacceptable 
to Armenia also, about which the speaker of the Armenian 
parliament has spoken, incidentally, but what is important is 
the actual will and readiness for peace. It should be considered 
that the peacemaking process is quite lengthy and entirely 
allows of all possible kinds of adjustments in the course of the 
negotiations. 
  It has to be said in connection with all this that many of 
us 
linked certain hopes with the formation in Azerbaijan of a civil 
society. But, unfortunately, there has been no particular 
success in the plane of systematic and stable contacts of the 
public of this country with representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh 
and Armenia, which is being drawn so actively into a resolution 
of the conflict, and perhaps we also share some of the blame for 
this. The shoots of such contacts have simply remained in 
embryonic state. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal 
to representatives of political parties and grassroots 
organizations of all three republics: If the political 
leadership is incapable of commencing a search for a practicable 
path toward peace, perhaps it would be easier to do this "from 
the bottom." Many organizations in Armenia are today prepared 
for contacts and dialogue with their counterparts in Azerbaijan, 
and, in my view, the state structures that are involved in 
external relations should be giving thought to a strengthening 
of relations between the civil society of Azerbaijan, the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Armenia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hopes--Fewer and Fewer"] </F>
  [Text] Citizens of Armenia have in 1994 come to have 
less faith in their own powers and in the development of 
democracy in this state. 
  "The data of sociological research undertaken on the 
initiative of the European Union and carried out by the 
Sociology Department of the Yerevan State University testify to 
this," Lyudmila Arutyunyan, head of the department, told a 
correspondent of the NOYAN TALAN Agency. The analysis was 
conducted on the basis of the responses to 10 questions, which 
affords an opportunity to draw a conclusion as to the extent to 
which democratic principles are observed in this country. 
Whereas in 1993 some 30 percent of those polled in Armenia 
responded to the question: "With which country do you link your 
hopes?" that they were counting "on themselves," more than 30, 
on Russia, and fewer than 30 percent, on Europe, in 1994, 
according to the results of the poll, 72 percent link their 
hopes with the Russian Federation, and only 4 percent are, as 
before, counting on themselves. To the question as to whether 
human rights are respected in the country, 19 percent answered 
in the affirmative, 81 percent, negative. On the whole, 
affection for the United States has diminished, having come to 
be replaced by a positive attitude toward the European Community. 
  The sociological research undertaken by the European Union 
("Eurobarometer") has been carried out in all countries of East 
Europe, and of the CIS countries, in Ukraine, the European part 
of Russia, Belarus, and Armenia.

<F P=106> [M. Ogandzhanyan report based on press agency material: "The </F>
Bishkek Protocol--`Disgrace' or Path to Peace?"] 
  [Text] As we know, at Geydar Aliyev's meeting with Jan 
Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE Minsk Conference, his deputy 
Mathias Mosberg, and Vladimir Kazimirov, ambassador at large of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia and personal 
representative of the president of Russia at the negotiations on 
the Karabakh conflict, on 13 May the president of Azerbaijan 
wholly and fully supported the Bishkek Protocol "since it 
creates the conditions for a cease-fire and permits the 
practical implementation of efforts pertaining to a settlement 
of the conflict." 
  Yet the Azerbaijan National Independence Party (PNNA) is 
declaring its rejection of the Bishkek Protocol. As the 
statement of this major opposition movement of the republic 
observes, "the signing of this document in conjunction with the 
so-called Nagorno-Karabakh Republic signifies international 
recognition of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, the commitment to 
the conflict zone of Russian troops, and, as a result, 
Azerbaijan's loss of control over part of its territory." The 
PNNA demands that the National Assembly adopt a decision on the 
dismissal of Speaker Rasul Guliyev, who has perpetrated an 
anticonstitutional act and who has exceeded his authority. Nazim 
Imanov, a leader of the PNNA, declared that if the authorities 
attempt to compel the National Assembly to recognize Rasul 
Guliyev's signature, the opposition will by all democratic means 
put pressure on the authorities to prevent such actions. 
  Similar statements were made by other political parties of 
Azerbaijan. A conference of 16 political parties of varying 
persuasions held on 11 May at the headquarters of the Musavat 
Party adopted a document addressed to Rasul Guliyev, chairman of 
the parliament of the republic, which sharply condemns the 
Bishkek Protocol that he signed. It was observed at the 
conference that the present leadership of Azerbaijan has from 
the very outset occupied a defeatist position on the Karabakh 
issue. 
  A number of women's organizations of Azerbaijan, including 
the Dilyara Aliyeva Society for the Defense of the Rights of 
Women, the Democratic Women organization, women's branches of 
the Musavat and Boz gurt parties, and others, adopted a joint 
statement, which rejects the Russian plan of a settlement of the 
Karabakh conflict as contrary to Azerbaijan's national 
interests. Tofik Gasymov, chairman of the parliamentary 
Committee for Constitutional Development and former minister of 
foreign affairs of Azerbaijan, is of the same opinion. "The 
document signed in Bishkek has no legal validity and is 
anticonstitutional," he declared. According to him, it is 
essential to take account of the fact that the question of an 
armistice does not come within the jurisdiction of the chairman 
of the Supreme Council but is within the jurisdiction of the 
president. 
  A Policy Center of political parties and organizations of 
the 
republic was created last Sunday in Azerbaijan. A statement 
adopted by this center emphatically condemns the actions of the 
leadership of Azerbaijan and calls the Bishkek Protocol 
"disgraceful." 
  But there the opposite opinion is in the republic also. A 
meeting of the center bloc of parties, which includes the 
Azerbaijan Democratic Independence Party, the Social Democratic 
Party, the Gummet Party, and others, approved the signing by the 
speaker of the parliament of Azerbaijan of the Bishkek Protocol. 
The document itself is seen as a readiness for peace 
negotiations, and the anxious calls of certain political forces, 
as an aspiration to disturb internal stability and a struggle 
for power. 
  Zardusht Alizade, leader of the Social Democratic Party of 
Azerbaijan, termed the Azerbaijan side's signing of the Bishkek 
Protocol a reasonable compromise. He emphasized here that a 
peace on milder terms could have been concluded prior to the 
capture of Agdam, but it was rejected at that time. 
  In response to the demand for his resignation Rasul Guliyev, 
speaker of the Azerbaijani parliament, declared: "I would resign 
with the utmost pleasure, but the interests of my people are for 
me higher than all else." 
  There was a demonstration recently in front of the Supreme 
Council of Azerbaijan building organized by the Dilyara Aliyeva 
Society for the Defense of the Rights of Women. The democrats 
demanded the annulment of the "Bishkek Protocol, which is a 
disgrace for Azerbaijan," and a political evaluation of the 
actions of the chairman of the parliament of Azerbaijan, who 
had, in their view, exceeded his authority. The police used 
force against the demonstrators, as a result of which several 
women received injuries and were taken to hospital.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Grigoryan: "End of a Legend?: A Captive </F>
Mujahidin Debunks the Myths"] 
  [Text] Various rumors, frequently bordering on 
fantasy, concerning mujahidin have been going around for several 
months now. The news media of Azerbaijan, skillfully stirring up 
interest in them, have been creating, not unsuccessfully, in the 
person of the mujahidin the heroic image of fighters for the 
faith and professional warriors. However, for a long time we 
were unable to find out what the mujahidin actually represent. 
Various gossip and rumors from Karabakh were highly 
contradictory, and it was difficult ascertaining anything 
specific. Altogether recently the Karabakhers succeeded in 
capturing near Fizuli a mujahidin whose evidence has thrown a 
good deal of light on the situation. Bakhtior Verbollakh 
Baberzai, commander of a "twenty" (20 men), was born in 1974, is 
from the Rashiddustan tribe, lived in the city of Mazar-e Sharif 
in the north of Afghanistan, and had left behind at home a 
mother and sister. During a bout of artillery shelling he was 
wounded in the eye and arm. Our doctors had to work very hard to 
get him back on his feet. What, for all that, has brought the 
mujahidin to Azerbaijan: Muslim solidarity or a chance to make 
some money? 
  The prisoner confessed that all the talk about fighting for 
the faith and against the infidel is merely an attempt to 
conceal the real reason for the appearance of the mujahidin in 
the zone of the Karabakh conflict. They were all promised 
generous compensation. Each warrior was promised approximately 
$5,000 a month. Even before arriving in Azerbaijan, each Afghan 
was paid an advance of 50,000 toman. They were then taken to 
Beylagan, where the first disappointment awaited them. They were 
arrested in the city by a military patrol and were sent to 
prison, where they were treated none too kindly and, in 
addition, had all their money taken from them. 
  Baberzai received his baptism of fire near Goradiz, which is 
where they are positioned still. The talk about several thousand 
mujahidin is correct as far as it goes since there are at the 
front one [line missing] 200 or 300 men. They fight according to 
this schedule: One day a week they are at the front, the 
remaining days are time off. The mujahidin are allowed to go in 
their time off to Baku and Mingechaur. A special flight takes 
those wishing to spend their time off at home in Afghanistan. 
  All problems arising with the mujahidin are resolved by 
their 
compatriot, one Vaidallakh, who is to be found in Baku and who 
is their official representative. 
  The prisoner was the commander of a "twenty." Of the 20 men, 
15 were Afghans, five, Azerbaijanis, whom, Baberzai maintains, 
they killed themselves. Relations with the Azerbaijanis did not 
amount to much right from the start, and all contacts with them 
were reduced to a minimum. "Money and drugs--that's what [line 
missing] the prisoner, maintaining that the Azerbaijanis 
remember them only when they want to obtain narcotics. The drugs 
trade is highly profitable, he says, and the income from it is 
frequently higher than the compensation promised by the 
Government of Azerbaijan for military services. 
  Concerning habitation and sustenance, the prisoner confirmed 
that they eat and live separately, since their coreligionists 
"live like the impious." Medical services are organized in 
Beylagan, where the wounded and sick mujahidin are treated. 
Despite the promises of the authorities, not all return home, it 
is true. Lest they attract the discontent and anger of the 
relatives of the deceased and also to conceal the true picture 
of losses among the Afghans the Government of Azerbaijan does 
not send all the deceased home. Many of them have found eternal 
refuge on Azerbaijani soil. 
  As far as the rumors concerning clashes with Russians are 
concerned, the prisoner admitted that his group had not 
encountered them personally. But clashes between the mujahidin 
themselves, the supporters of various groupings and parties, 
occur very often, which is causing the authorities of Azerbaijan 
a great deal of trouble. 
  The prisoner is, despite it all, optimistic. He acknowledged 
that he misses his mother and sister very much and hopes, with 
Allah's help, for a safe return home.

<F P=106> [Report by A. Silanadze, Minister for the Management of </F>
Republic of Georgia State Property: "On the Progress of 
Implementing the State Program for the Privatization of State 
Enterprises in the Republic of Georgia" -- all figures as 
published] 
  [Excerpts] As of 5 May 1994, there were 4,901 facilities 
to be privatized on a list approved by a decree of the Republic

privatized (22.9 percent) for the sum of 92,708,097,500 coupons 
(rubles), and 9,857 vehicles that are economically impractical 
to use have been privatized for the sum of 1,319,566,000 coupons 
(rubles). The total receipts from privatization amount to 
94,027,663,500 coupons (rubles). 
  Facilities that have been privatized include 464 commercial 
facilities for the sum of 77,295,686,600 coupons (rubles); 549 
consumer service facilities -- 8,132,264,900 coupons (rubles); 
148 gas stations -- 384,899,100 coupons (rubles); seven small 
hydroelectric power stations -- 416,106,900 coupons (rubles); 27 
agricultural facilities -- 1,064,299,200 coupons (rubles); nine 
facilities servicing the food industry -- 1,028,884,600 coupons 
(rubles); 24 industrial installations -- 1,319,861,600 coupons 
(rubles); three transportation enterprises -- 186,323,000 
coupons (rubles); one construction and architectural facility --

2,269,814,200 coupons (rubles); three tourist departments -- 
121,716,900 coupons (rubles); two printing corporations -- 
105,594,000 coupons (rubles); [passage omitted] 
  The necessary legislative and normative base has been 
created 
for implementing the process of turning large enterprises into 
joint-stock companies. According to currently available 
information, there are up to 900 enterprises that are to be 
transformed into joint-stock companies, including 201 facilities 
within the Ministry of Industry, 253 in the Ministry of 
Agricultural and Food Industry, 121 in the Ministry of 
Architecture and Construction, 46 in the Ministry of Trade and 
Material Resources, 131 in the Department of Transportation, and 
so forth. 
  Up to now, only 39 joint-stock companies have been 
registered. These include 20 from the Ministry of Industry, 
seven from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Food Industry, 
four from the Ministry of Architecture and Construction, two 
from the Ministry of Trade and Material Resources, two from the 
Department of Transportation, one from the Science and 
Technology Committee, one from the Tourist Committee, two from 
the Tbilisi municipality, and one from the Tbilisi City Hall. 
Up to 30 more joint-stock companies are to be registered in the 
near future. 
  Work is progressing on the formation of specialized voucher 
investment privatization funds. Up to now, the ministry has 
issued licenses for the management of voucher investment funds 
to 60 legal and physical entities. Of the voucher investment 
funds that have already been established, 15 have received 
licenses from the ministry. 
  In Tbilisi, 324 facilities have been privatized. [passage 
omitted] 
  Of the 324 facilities that have been sold in Tbilisi, 136 
owners have had their contracts legalized and been given 
certificates of ownership by the ministry. [passage omitted] 
  The table appended to this information indicates the 
progress 
of the privatization of Republic of Georgia state property 
according to regions as of 5 May 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Basayev: "Will the `Teziyev Affair' Turn </F>
Into a Corruption Trial?"] 
  [Text] The chronology of events is true and, very important 
for the investigation, is on record in the "For Official Use 
Only" reports of MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] officers who 
worked in the conflict zone before temporary administrations 
were formed on the territory of the North Ossetian SSR [Soviet 
Socialist Republic] and Ingush Republic. 
  On 9 June 1992 a crowd of refugees from South Ossetia 
surrounded the residential settlement and military base "Philipp 
Holzmann," which was being built at the ninth kilometer of the 
Vladikavkaz-Beslan highway for military units being withdrawn 
from Germany. Military guards opened fire to kill, but were 
immediately overrun by the mob. On that day 12 122-mm 
self-propelled artillery systems (SAS) were taken from the 
military base and driven under the Ossetian flag through 
Vladikavkaz. 
  At night the situation in the North Ossetian capital was to 
all practical purposes not under the control of the authorities 
and law enforcement organs. On 10 June South Ossetians seized 
the Vladikavkaz garrison's central base, from which ammunition 
for SAS and submachine guns were carried away in KamAZ trucks. 
No one even attempted to stop this deadly convoy on its way to 
South Ossetia. During that time a nonstop rally was being held 
in the city, the participants demanding the resignation of North 
Ossetia Supreme Soviet Chairman Galazov, Prime Minister 
Khetagurov, and Minister of Internal Affairs Kantemirov... 
  It was at this time that the head of the South Ossetian 
Government, Oleg Teziyev, was arrested on the territory of North 
Ossetia--to be precise, on the Vladikavkaz-Alagir highway. A 
spetznaz group blocked the Mercedes and captured together with 
Teziyev a bodyguard and two Russians. The latter did not have a 
chance to make use of submachine guns and a TT handgun. 
Literally several hours before the capture of the South Ossetian 
prime minister some local residents had been arrested in 
Prigorodnyy Rayon; in the trunk of their car was an AKM 
[modified Kalashnikov automatic rifle] and a suitcase full of 
money. At the very first interrogation the arrested testified 
that they had just bought the weapon from Teziyev; a serial 
number check showed that the AKM was from consignments stolen 
from the warehouse at the "Philipp Holzmann" base. Thus, the 
North Ossetian (that is, Russian) procuracy initiated criminal 
proceedings against Oleg Teziyev, on charges of organizing an 
armed attack on a military installation and illegal arms trading. 
  Teziyev and his companions were kept in a Vladikavkaz 
preliminary investigative facility for more than a day. During 
that time practically all North Ossetia's highest officials 
experienced pressure from the southerners. A group was already 
being readied in Tkshinvali which was supposed, according to one 
of its members, to "smash this Vladikavkaz--and Galazov with 
it--into pieces." Then Teziyev was let go, with an apology. 
  Now he is under arrest again. 
  An entrepreneur from North Ossetia, Oleg Teziyev got the job 
of head of South Ossetia's government almost by accident. It 
appears that the People's Front of South Ossetia's design was to 
bring a northerner into this job during one of the hardest times 
for South Ossetia and, thus making a national hero out of him, 
return him later to Vladikavkaz, this time as a potential leader 
of North Ossetia. According to confidential information, the job 
of South Ossetian prime minister was first offered to Sergey 
Tabolov, director of North Ossetian Humanitarian Sciences 
Research Institute, but he refused. After which somehow Oleg 
Teziyev came on the scene on his own. 
  Despite a certain popularity the energetic prime minister 
enjoyed in South Ossetia, to a large extent he remained an 
outsider in Tskhinvali. He got practically all his connections 
and contacts from National Front leader Alan Chochiyev. It was 
also the latter who recommended to Teziyev his closest aides and 
advisers--for instance, Minister of Defense Valeriy Khubulov, 
OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments] commander Vadim 
Gazzayev, and others. Later, however, it somehow was forgotten 
that the initiative for all these government appointments and 
parceling out some or other authority came from Alan Chochiyev 
rather than Oleg Teziyev, who during this period became easy 
prey for the National Front's personnel policy. 
  In Tskhinvali, Teziyev was mostly engaged in arms purchases 
and arming South Ossetian armed formations. In this respect he 
managed to establish within a short period of time relations 
with the Russian military, including with those who make the 
principal political decisions. Seriously speaking, the South 
Ossetian "victory" in the war with Georgia was the result of 
Teziyev and his retinue's unprecedented activism. Over a very 
short period of time South Ossetia received enough arms to 
withstand a Georgian offensive. 
  After the cessation of military operations in South Ossetia, 
Teziyev's activities practically fully shifted to Moscow. A 
system of commercial enterprises was set up in the Russian 
capital, financed illegally with the money South Ossetia 
received as a result of division of the all-Union budget. The 
plan was for these structures to supply South Ossetia with all 
it needed: arms, foodstuffs, basic necessities, and cash 
(banking operations with South Ossetia had been suspended, and 
therefore people in Tskhinvali had not been paid wages for 
months--there was no cash in rubles, and Georgia had dropped out 
of the ruble zone). These commercial structures were headed by 
Moscow Ossetians--mainly relatives of National Front leader Alan 
Chochiyev. In setting up and financing these operations, 
Teziyev, acting on behalf of the Alagir company, trusted 
Chochiyev's proteges enough not to ask for receipts; later this 
led to an endless series of score-settling involving 
professional "enforcers." 
  Teziyev's absence from Tskhinvali and his operations with 
large amounts of money created a situation where some field 
commanders began to demand guarantees that Teziyev would in fact 
work in their interests. Teziyev offered as a guarantee of his 
"loyalty" his older son Teymuraz, who was placed to serve in the 
Tskhinvali OMON on the promise of this unit's commander, Vadim 
Gazzayev, to take care of the junior's safety. In reality, 
Teymuraz Teziyev was a hostage, and the degree of his safety was 
defined not by Gazzayev but by the National Guard commander Alan 
Dzhioyev, nicknamed "Parpat." It was he who later took Teziyev 
Jr. in his car out of the OMON base and demanded from the prime 
minister billions in cash in exchange for his son (this 
information was supplied by the prime minister's former aide, 
Ye. Krutikov). 
  Teziyev's son was let go for a ransom of a hard-to-pronounce 
amount. Most of the participants in this drama are no longer 
alive: Vadim Gazzayev was killed on the doorstep of his house by 
a gang of marauders, and Alan Dzhioyev was shot to death at the 
OMON base by its new commander, Siukayev. Nevertheless, this 
story, which has been kept secret for a long time, demonstrates 
very well the degree of criminality of the military and 
political leadership of South Ossetia. Field commanders, most of 
whom engage without any qualms whatsoever in drug trafficking in 
Georgia, racketeering in North Ossetia and Moscow, kidnapping, 
and reselling stolen cars, openly extorted money from Teziyev. 
He became nearly the sole channel for the flow of arms and cash 
for some armed formation in South Ossetia. 
  Oleg Teziyev moved to Moscow for good in the spring of 1993, 
together with his close associates (among them, those known to 
the investigation are Aleksey Tkachuk, a former officer of the 
Pskov Airborne Troops Division [PATD] and the commandant of the 
city of Tskhinvali, and Tskhinvali resident Atsamaz Alborov). In 
addition to commercial activities, they were buying arms from 
PATD officers and, through the same criminal group (about 30 
persons), smuggling arms from Estonia. The scale of activities 
of South Ossetian arms traders is evidenced by the fact that 
heavy armaments were being sold to Teziyev almost openly--in 
Saransk and Syzran the South Ossetian prime minister managed to 
buy several dozen units of armored equipment, and in Pskov 
negotiations were underway regarding purchases of "Igla" 
air-defense systems (the Soviet equivalent of the "Stinger"). 
Sales of a considerable quantity of armored equipment and arms 
to South Ossetia had been authorized by major political figures 
in Moscow, which gives the investigation the flavor of an 
impending scandal: The Teziyev affair may become the largest 
trial on corruption and illegal financial machinations on the 
part of some high-ranking officers of the General Staff, the 
Airborne Troops command, and members of the president of 
Russia's staff. 
  Oleg Teziyev and Aleksey Tkachuk, who was arrested in 
Aprelevka in suburban Moscow, also are being charged with 
racketeering. This charge came as a result of score-settling 
among Moscow commercial operators of Ossetian descent, whose 
companies were illegally financed by Teziyev. Some of them (for 
instance, Valeriy Kaytulov, head of the Kadeshk and Bezopasnost 
companies, who currently lives in Toronto) accused Teziyev and 
his retinue of racketeering and officially asked for MVD 
assistance after they had been forced to "account" for their 
activities to Oleg Teziyev, who had financed them. A tense 
situation also developed around Alan Chochiyev, former leader of 
the National Front of South Ossetia, who, in his own words, 
"withdrew from politics and learned to make money in Moscow." 
There is information that it is he--the former ideologist of 
South Ossetian independence--who had initiated a number of 
illegal financial operations which nearly bankrupted Teziyev and 
brought considerable profit to commercial operators--Chochiyev's 
relatives. At this point the investigation believes that 
Chochiyev is in the United States. 
  Oleg Teziyev was probably the key figure in the course of 
military operations in the fall of 1992 in North Ossetia's 
Prigorodnyy Rayon. Several days before the bloody deportation of 
Ingush from Prigorodnyy Rayon, then Prime Minister of South 
Ossetia Sergey Khetagurov and Aleksandr Dzasokhov went by 
helicopter to Tskhinvali and talked to Teziyev about "protecting 
Ossetia from Ingush." The South Ossetian brigade was 
distinguished by exceptional cruelty, which had developed in 
southerners over the years of bloody war of attrition with 
Georgia, marauding and plunder in Ingush villages. Actually, 
their northern brothers also got a taste of it... They were 
commanded by the same Alan Dzhioyev ("Parpat") and Minister of 
Defense Valeriy Khebelov. Oleg Teziyev was in Vladikavkaz, where 
he was "working" with Russia's representatives, in particular, 
Georgiy Khizha, who later stated that he was not aware of a 
single instance of marauding on the part of South Ossetian 
volunteers." 
  At the same time Oleg Teziyev represented a serious danger 
for the North Ossetian government which disliked him. 
Vladikavkaz permitted the southerners to carry out the "march of 
foreign-made cars"--a mass transfer into South Ossetia of cars 
commandeered in Prigorodnyy Rayon, while Galazov at the meeting 
of the North Ossetian Supreme Soviet thanked the southerners for 
"brotherly help." Teziyev personally, however, remained 
dangerous as a man who quite easily could lay claim to high 
positions in the government of North Ossetia. 
  There are several versions regarding Oleg Teziyev's current 
arrest. In reality people of his rank or caliber almost never 
get investigated or arrested--the sponsors and the unique 
connections that permit them to conduct extremely risky and 
profitable operations with arms and illegal financing of 
commercial structures are just too strong. According to one, 
Oleg Teziyev was "surrendered" by Moscow businessmen of Ossetian 
descent who held a grudge against him. In particular, 
information that enabled the investigation to charge Teziyev 
with racketeering and illegal financing of commercial 
organizations was found during a search of the premises of the 
Kadeshk and Bezopasnost companies in the area of the 
Aviamotornaya subway station. According to another, Teziyev's 
arrest was the result of a battle in the Russian Government 
between several groups oriented in their activities on the 
shadow economy side of Russia's Caucasus policy. It is 
anticipated that the "Teziyev affair" will lead the 
investigation to high-ranking members of the president's staff 
and the government, against whom actually this whole game is 
being played. According to still another version, Teziyev's 
arrest was almost an accident, a corollary to improper behavior 
on the part of Aleksey Tkachuk; this explanation is hardly 
worthy of attention, however. 
  One way or another an end has been put to the activities of 
a 
criminal group engaged in illegal arms sales, racketeering, and 
financing of commercial enterprises (including a number of banks 
in Moscow and Vladikavkaz), creating illegal armed formations, 
and organizing mass disorder. 
  FROM THE EDITORS: Mountain people have this saying: 
"When a man rushes too fast toward the smell of shishkebab, he 
may find upon arrival that the smell comes from donkeys being 
branded..." In the Caucasus, wisdom and criminal lack of 
restraint have existed side by side since time immemorial. This 
may perhaps be why it became a suitable location of action for 
"script writers"--the powers that be--writing cynical and 
frightening scenarios of interethnic and other armed conflicts. 
Because for centuries war has been a method of political 
struggle and material enrichment. A. Basayev's article is an 
attempt to "figure out" the authors through the performers. We 
are ready to provide the same opportunity to those who have in 
their possession information and their own vision of the 
situation in other "hot spots" of the former USSR. Because we 
are dealing with an already-established blueprint for committing 
crimes against humanity. And it appears that this blueprint 
works without fail in Georgia, Abkhazia, the south of Russia, 
Tajikistan. Without fail--and with impunity.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aslan Abashidze by Yelena Imedashvili; place </F>
and date not given: "In Batumi Everything Is Serene, It Is Warm 
There..."] 
  [Text] Ajaria is the sole corner of present-day 
Georgia not desecrated by civil war. This is undoubtedly to the 
credit of Ajar leader Aslan Abashidze, chairman of the Supreme 
Council of the autonomous republic. It appears that "Big 
Granddaddy," as Abashidze is called among his own people, is 
distinguished by a rare capacity for avoiding predetermined 
conflicts and shunning dangerous alliances and burdensome 
obligations. It is said that he knows how to make money and 
loves Ajaria, Russia, and his grandson. In addition, he knows 
how to "keep up his reputation." There are not that many 
meetings between the chairman of the Supreme Council of Ajaria 
and the head of the Georgian state, and they have all been held 
either on neutral territory or in Ajaria. 
  [Imedashvili] Mr. Abashidze, when were you last in Tbilisi? 
  [Abashidze] I have not been to Tbilisi since October 1990. I 
consider the situation in the country to be very unstable, and a 
visit by me could be used to inflame the atmosphere. These 
cannot be called apprehensions, I simply avoid needless 
complications.... 
  [Imedashvili] According to the information of sociological 
polls, inhabitants of Georgia most often cite you as a possible 
successor to Shevardnadze. You are also spoken of as the most 
realistic candidate for the office of prime minister of the 
country. 
  [Abashidze] It is not a new topic, but I believe that at 
this 
time I am needed by Georgia here more than in the office of 
prime minister. As far as the results of sociological surveys 
are concerned... We do not publish them in our newspapers. I am 
skeptical toward this information; a poll of some 1,000 persons 
is not serious. I personally know approximately what percentage 
of the population supports me in this part of Georgia or in 
another and, of course, in Ajaria. 
  [Imedashvili] How many in Ajaria? 
  [Abashidze] We know that the Ajar leadership has total 
support. 
  [Imedashvili] There are stories to the effect that Ajaria 
has 
peacefully achieved full independence from Tbilisi, which 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia have not managed. How true is this? 
  [Abashidze] As truthful as stories usually are. We sought 
nothing, and it cannot be said that we had some special program 
in this connection. As far as I am concerned, I have always, 
wherever I have worked, defended the interests of my department. 
I believe that everyone should defend his home, street, 
neighborhood, city. 
  The legislative base that we used to have accorded the 
regions quite extensive rights--we have not taken advantage of 
even half of them. It is always the case that we say one thing, 
think another, and do something else. The main problem in the 
relations between the center and the regions today is not 
legislation, the problem is the government bureaucrat, who sits 
on a bench in Tbilisi and considers himself the sole arbiter of 
fate. It may be said that it was this that brought about what 
has happened in Georgia. 
  Ajaria is not threatened by the fate of Abkhazia or the 
Tskhinvali region, our republic is populated by ethnic 
Georgians. But the opposition of the center and the regions, 
which exists at administrative officer level, could, of course, 
lead to cataclysms because there is always the danger of the 
accession to power of people who are totally uninhibited. 
  [Imedashvili] You are satisfied with your relations with 
Tbilisi? 
  [Abashidze] I cannot speak of a complete idyll here. It 
happens that some leader from Tbilisi will impede some decision 
or other, and jealousy is sensed at times. When a little man 
sits at a big table, it is always fraught with unpleasantness. 
  [Imedashvili] Your view of the future territorial 
arrangement 
of Georgia? 
  [Abashidze] The rayons and oblasts of Georgia took shape 
over 
many centuries. Territorially and ethnically, this is certain, 
there is nothing that could be changed--there would be fighting 
for each square meter. We are left merely with the question of 
imparting to this reality a reasonable form and of precisely 
delineating what pertains to the jurisdiction of the federal 
authorities, and what to the regional authorities. And under no 
circumstances can the nationality issue--Ossetian or Abkhaz--be 
substituted for this problem. 
  [Imedashvili] You are the leader of the "For the Revival of 
Ajaria" movement, and its motto is: "A wealthy individual means 
a wealthy state." Are you a wealthy individual? 
  [Abashidze] The richest people, as we all know, live in 
Georgia; everyone is a millionaire in Georgia (laughs). No, I am 
not avoiding an answer. Economically, our family lives well; 
there are no problems. The Abashidzes are not by nature 
squanderers but accumulators. I have worked my whole life and 
held quite high office and I was left a substantial 
inheritance--my grandfather was a notable individual--even in 
spite of the expropriation of 1937. Incidentally, the princely 
Abashidze family ruled Ajaria from 1462 through the end of the 
19th Century. 
  [Imedashvili] And as regards the "wealthy state?" 
  [Abashidze] Just as throughout Georgia, the same problems: 
inflation, low living standard, decline in production. We are 
trying to the best of our ability to get the work of the 
enterprises back to normal and to help the population with 
social benefits. In general, I feel sorry for today's Georgia. 
It was created in order to be a prosperous country. Had we 
immediately created a free economic zone in Ajaria, Georgia 
would now be unrecognizable, but certain forces do not want 
this--to the detriment of the entire country. This is beyond any 
logic, but there are always some people who are afraid of new 
things and who are protesting even the building of a pedestrian 
subway. 
  I have seen films about the old Hong Kong before the 
creation 
of a free economic zone there. Compared with that Hong Kong, 
Batumi is Paris. And had there been free economic zones in 
Batumi, Poti, Sukhumi, things might not have reached the point 
of explosion. When people live well, many problems are removed. 
When they live badly, there are always political forces that 
take advantage of this to assert themselves. 
  [Imedashvili] Georgia is integrating in several alliances, 
among which are CIS and Black Sea economic cooperation. Which of 
them is most promising, in your view? 
  [Abashidze] Friendship is an unparalleled value. We, 
figuratively speaking, went a-hunting and all went separately. 
Some people are the hunters, some, the prey. Georgia has fewer 
chances of procuring rich spoils than others, and for this 
reason we need to proceed together, having united on a new 
basis, on a platform of sincerity. Sincerity, sincerity, and yet 
again sincerity--this is my principle in all things. We need 
first and foremost good relations with Russia. We are 
interrelated and urgently need one another. Making friends with 
Russia does not mean falling out with the rest. On the contrary, 
stable relations with it will help us to more quickly begin 
cooperation with other countries. 
  [Imedashvili] Is sincerity typical of your relations with 
Shevardnadze? 
  [Abashidze] I have never concealed anything, I speak openly, 
harshly at times, too emotionally at times. There are words that 
I would not use at a grand forum, but I always say everything 
one on one. This is my main weapon. Life is easier if you don't 
harbor grudges. And you have more friends also. Don't they say 
that everyone strives for the pure spring? 
  [Imedashvili] What do you do, aside from work? 
  [Abashidze] Now, only work. This is my sole hobby. I have, 
in 
addition, a grandson, we are great friends. It is said that I 
have the capabilities of an artist, but I have no time for 
drawing. Life has been such that I have been unable to take 
advantage of what I was given from above. 
  [Imedashvili] What have you managed to get done in the time 
that you have been leader of Ajaria? 
  [Abashidze] We do not have hundreds of thousands of refugees 
or tens of thousands of people killed, disgraced, and destitute. 
We have preserved peace at home, we have not made a single 
mistake here. We have no nationality problem, no Abkhaz living 
in Ajaria has taken part in the interethnic conflict. What have 
I not achieved? I have not managed to school many officials in 
executive discipline. They cannot work at full stretch, they 
cannot learn to work in a team, everyone wants to be a soloist. 
Perhaps this is an ailment of people of the Caucasus, 
hot-blooded people....

<F P=106> [Article by Parliament Deputy Givi Abalaki: "We Will Get Our </F>
Daily Bread by Supporting the Countryside"] 
  [Text] I fully share the general concern over the situation 
we are in today and wish to express a few specific thoughts 
about the agrarian sector. 
  I want to say that if we cannot halt the inertia of the old 
thinking, dismantle the old management structures, institute 
broad reforms in the agrarian sector, implement mass 
privatization of all means of production, and boost agriculture 
and put that sector's big reserves to work, we are not going to 
be able to avert famine, let alone consolidate the country's 
financial situation, to which the agrarian sector can make a 
major contribution. 
  Georgia's agriculture today is in total ruins; in my 
opinion, 
this is the bitter result of launching reforms without enough 
preparation. 
  There are those who think that agricultural reform involves 
land privatization only. Let me remind them that despite the 
major shortcomings that came from increasing the amount of the 
people's household land, more than half the cultivated farmland 
was turned over to the private sector--and still crops are less 
than they were five or ten years ago, when the private sector 
owned less than 15 percent of the cultivated land. 
  The fact is that, along with land privatization, 
agricultural 
reform equally requires the establishment of market forms, the 
nurturing of independent entrepreneurs, the creation of a modern 
system of relations between them and the state, the expansion of 
free communications, the fostering of a new spirit of 
proprietorship, and, most important, protection of the peasant. 
Unless these market levers are adopted and put to work, it will 
be impossible to nurture the new-type farmer, who will remain 
trapped in the habits of the state farm worker or kolkhoznik. 
Naturally, one-sided reform (which is what is happening now, if 
you can even call it reform) has only served to worsen our 
situation. 
  The way out of the predicament is to implement reforms 
rationally and to support the development primarily of private 
structures (i.e., entrepreneurs) and create the necessary 
conditions for them to operate, in order to solve the food 
crisis swiftly. We also need to keep in mind that while the old 
collectivization deflected agriculture from its normal path of 
development, indiscriminate privatization today will end up 
making the same mistake. 
  I don't share the widespread notion that Georgia is a 
country 
that is poor in agricultural resources. If we use our land and 
resources wisely, they can feed the country and even enable us 
to help others. How can we speak of making productive use of our 
land when we have never managed to have a hectare produce an 
average of more than 26 quintals of grain, 60 quintals of fruit, 
130 quintals of potatoes, and so on. Yet with progressive forms 
of management our fertile land could easily produce 40 to 50 
quintals of grain, 150 to 200 quintals of fruit, 250 to 300 
quintals of potatoes, and so on. To confirm this, just remember 
the abundant and bountiful lives of our German colonists before 
the war. 
  Again, future generations are not going to think we acted 
wisely when we frittered away the assets of the kolkhozes and 
state farms at the behest and under the leadership of those 
pathetic representatives of the national movement. It was their 
stupid doctrines and actions that resulted in the looting of 
agriculture equipment, vehicles, livestock, crops and produce, 
monetary resources, and the wealth built up by the rural 
population's joint efforts. The people who created this 
monstrosity are basically those who have done nothing to create 
social wealth and only care about getting rich without working. 
  We have to face the truth and admit that the old structures 
of agricultural proprietorship have been destroyed, and those 
who destroyed them have created nothing new; destruction and 
construction are different things. Not only that, we do not yet 
even have in place the legal base necessary to design the 
strategy and tactics to convert agriculture to the market 
economy. Well, why don't we? It wouldn't have required capital 
investment for fuel and lubricants, would it? You have to agree 
that one reason why we don't have proprietary farmers (of either 
the old or the new type) is that agricultural productivity has 
dropped drastically. How are we going to produce anything if we 
have given land to the rural population in an unsystematic 
manner and nobody has even thought to create the essential 
conditions for the use of the land that feeds us? The results 
are there for all to see! Over the past two years, many 
thousands of hectares have remained uncultivated, and, sad to 
say, it looks as if things will get no better this year. 
  I simply don't understand why no land tax system has been 
worked out yet, and the state has been losing large amounts of 
revenues for three years--quite apart from its role as an 
incentive to encourage the owner of the land to produce goods. 
How can we excuse the fact that, on the pretext of 
privatization, we have divided up large tracts that would have 
provided excellent conditions for the use of mechanization? 
Also, the small plots have been given out in many places, 
creating chaos. Hundreds of hectares of farmland have been 
stolen; in many places, even the rayon authorities don't know 
whose hands they are in. How can we excuse the fact that local 
agricultural agencies, farm managers, and farm specialists have 
been left out of land privatization policy? These and many other 
violations have brought us to our present predicament, and if we 
don't realize the danger today, tomorrow it will be too late. 
  In order to get out of this grave situation, it is essential 
to put a stop to methods of land privatization which have a bad 
odor because of the incompetent intervention by certain 
dilettantes in agricultural matters, especially considering that 
it is taking place under conditions of complete chaos and 
dereliction by the authorities. As for instituting taxes this 
year on lands distributed to the population, an intermediate way 
has to be found which will maximally enhance every citizen's 
responsibility and will frankly recognize all of the land area 
actually in his possession, in order to avoid expectable 
difficulties which, very likely, the law ought to take into 
account. The way to do this, I think, is to formalize citizens' 
possession of their land by way of declaration and levy taxes on 
that basis. I believe that this move will do much to promote 
abundant agricultural production. 
  At the same time, the Georgian Parliament must speed up the 
creation of the legal base for comprehensive agricultural 
reform, and the executive branch will have to see that it is 
properly implemented. Laws passed by the Parliament must be used 
to check on the legality of the lands that have been already 
been issued, in order to rectify violations. It is painful to 
see the present government's failure to take care of the land, 
which is costing our people dearly. 
  It is criminal how hasty privatization of the land has 
resulted in mass giveaways and fragmentation of the land, the 
uprooting of orchards and vineyards, neglect and deterioration 
of croplands, missed opportunities to set up 
individual-proprietor farms, conflicts between individuals and 
villages, and many other misfortunes which have done great harm 
to the state. 
  The people want to know who the main culprits are and 
whether 
they are being called to account. 
  Another essential condition is to reorganize the kolkhozes 
and state farms in such a way that formations of independent 
entrepreneurs take shape based in them in accordance with market 
relations, formations which are the owners and proprietors of 
their means of production and the goods they produce. Each farm, 
village, district, resident, and individual must find a place 
and role in a reformed agriculture; the confusion, 
misunderstanding, and mistrust that have ravaged the countryside 
for the past three or four years must come to an end. 
  Land areas which remain after privatization but which are 
not 
large enough for collective farm management must be transferred 
immediately to the population on the basis of mutually 
acceptable agreements and obligations. Large tracts, moreover, 
must not be broken up into smaller ones, and we must strictly 
comply with principles of land use and compactness. 
  Instead, because of slipshod privatization measures, 
disreputable and incompetent people have largely taken over the 
privatization commissions. Their criminal actions have promoted 
giveaways, and much of the land has wound up in the hands of 
people who don't care about farming and are just waiting for a 
chance to sell it off and get rich. The Cabinet of Ministers has 
done wrong to pass decrees by which local commissions have been 
given unrestricted rights to allot land to the population, and 
the government can't interfere (or at least isn't interfering) 
even when the commissions' decisions are clearly in conflict 
with governmental decrees and the interests of the country. What 
is essential, then, is to re-inventory the land, not only with 
the participation of the village commissions, which will 
definitely have to be reconstituted, but also by representatives 
of state agencies. Their figures alone must be used in 
continuing privatization and rectifying mistakes. We must 
register every square meter of land with the state. The 
government has to know who owns the land and pays the taxes. 
  As far as possible we must provide production services for 
farm entrepreneurs, especially in the case of household peasant 
and individual farm operations, which have been left on their 
own--yet it is they who are best able to produce a fast return. 
Because of the fact that the managers of kolkhozes and state 
farms (in most places) have, on purpose or not, ended up distant 
from agricultural reform, they are no longer providing any help 
in working the land that has been given to the rural population. 
In places where social-sector farms no longer exist, their 
tractors, motor vehicles, farm equipment and other assets have 
been sold off wholesale, written off, or stolen. A wise 
proprietor would have created formations to service household 
farm operations, on a cost accounting basis, to do farm work for 
the population for an appropriate fee. Hence, conditions today 
demand that we create a system to provide services to household 
farm operations using locally existing farm equipment. Where 
kolkhozes and state farms still exist, they should take over 
this duty; where they no longer exist, we should create 
specialized links to provide the services, for which we should 
bring together the equipment that has been sold off through 
various machinations. That's just for now; in the future, it 
will not be sufficient, and we must immediately undertake to 
create a broad network of state, commercial, and private sectors 
to service farm entrepreneurs. It should be in charge not only 
of tractor operations but also the whole cycle of production 
services. This will free the entrepreneur from all kinds of 
extraneous worries so that he can devote his energy to boosting 
production. 
  Let me say at this point that instead of helping, the 
finance 
and credit system (which, we can say confidently, no longer 
exists now) forced many to give up on commercial farming and to 
take up occupations that are easier. It's true we are hard-up 
ourselves, but if we are to improve things we must find ways and 
means to give farmers a break. During parliamentary discussions 
of this question I have been surprised by some of my colleagues' 
opposition to credit for agriculture, although I fully share 
their doubts over the proper use of allocated funds, of which 
there are plenty of bad examples. We think agriculture needs to 
be granted immediate preferential credit in the necessary 
amounts; in turn, the government and the Agriculture Ministry 
must work out specific mechanisms to ensure proper use of the 
credit. 
  We must immediately implement privatization in livestock 
farming, because the chaos which we have created is doing 
irreparable harm to this sector, and one of the best ways to get 
out of this predicament, I think, is through well organized 
privatization. Buildings and structures, livestock, tools and 
equipment, and feed croplands also need to be privatized. It 
should, moreover, be on the basis of competition. I really don't 
understand why it's taking so long to privatize livestock 
farming. Privatization will give each livestock operation a true 
proprietor and put a stop to thievery. Why are we dragging our 
feet? Can it be that certain people will not benefit from 
stability, law, and order in the sector? 
  Another thing is that we have been harmed greatly by the 
mass 
blackmailing of professional, experienced and competent workers 
in agriculture in the past three or four years. A lot of worthy 
and highly qualified specialists have quit the field as a 
result. All of you know who took their places and what that has 
cost the people.... The time is late, of course, but we must 
help the countryside by turning things over to worthy people who 
understand reform and know how to implement it. The people will 
certainly trust and follow them. At the same time, the one to be 
considered the winner in the competition should not be the one 
who pays the most but rather the citizen or group that submits 
the best program for the operation of the livestock farm or 
complex in terms of its rated capacity and pledges to implement 
that program meticulously. I would not only support the sale but 
even the free transfer of all the above assets under that 
procedure. 
  To illustrate the importance of the village leader I will 
cite one example: on Gorskiy Rayon's Kintsnisi State Farm, which 
has been under the leadership of Batoni Mikheil Koblianidze for 
a long time, not a single farm window was smashed during the 
events in Samachablo (the farm is located near Tskhinvali). The 
tractor fleet and farm equipment there have been preserved 
intact, whereas in many other places which were relatively calm, 
everything has been wrecked. Even sadder is the fact that many 
farms have been looted with at least the connivance if not the 
actual participation of village leaders. But for some reason, 
enforcement of the law, which would inspire hope and trust in 
the working people of the village, has been delayed or dragged 
out. 
  I spoke out more specifically on all the above recently in 
Parliament, but unfortunately no one showed much interest in 
these problems. I, on the other hand, feel these things very 
deeply. I feel the pain of the countryside, because my own 
family lives in a typical Georgian village and has never 
abandoned the land. My family is still considered an ordinary 
village proprietor. Last year, we had per-hectare yields of more 
than 100 quintals of corn, 150 quintals of fruit, 700 quintals 
of beets, 500 quintals of vegetables, and so on. 
  Let me say in conclusion that we seem to have forgotten the 
countryside while playing at democracy, and we've been reaping 
what we deserve. This reproach probably applies equally to all 
levels of government in the past five years, and to today's 
Parliament as well, which has failed to create the necessary 
legal base for agriculture reform. It also applies to the 
Cabinet of Ministers, which has failed to protect village 
proprietors; it applies to local authorities, who have turned 
their backs on the plight of the peasant; and it applies to us, 
together and singly, because we have done nothing effective to 
preserve and enhance this vital sector. 
  Given its predicament, the countryside has turned its back 
on 
us; today it is powerless, it cannot feed the country or 
contribute anything to the state budget. Yet it could fill half 
the budget. 
  If we want to have our daily bread in abundance we will have 
to come to the aid of the countryside and support it. This is 
the only way to achieve bountiful agricultural production.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Defense Minister Tengiz Kitovani by </F>
Armaz Saneblidze: "They're Spreading Rumors About Me; At Least 
They Remember Me"; in Moscow, date not given] 
  [Text] We are lazy and curious--a maxim I read 
somewhere. 
  I met Georgian member of parliament and former defense 
minister Tengiz Kitovani in Moscow, in the Georgian embassy, at 
a time when people in Tbilisi were saying the Interpol had 
arrested him in Germany. 
  [Saneblidze] Where are you now, Batono Tengiz, and what are 
you doing? 
  [Kitovani] You're probably asking because the city is full 
of 
rumors about me. Naturally you are interested; so many changes 
are taking place that.... I was in Germany and flew to Moscow. 
There is a lot to do, because here in Moscow there are major 
forces working against us, both politically and economically. We 
should have been doing this work earlier. If you remember my 
speeches in Parliament, I have always said that if we lose our 
connections and fail to restore our good old traditions with 
Russia, we will suffer both economically and politically. I have 
said this many times to Batoni Eduard, but reactionary circles 
in Georgia have to some extent blocked Georgian-Russian 
relations. 
  [Saneblidze] In some circles people are saying that 
Georgia's 
joining the Commonwealth is tantamount to returning to the 
Russian Empire. If you had attended the 1 March session of 
Parliament, would you have supported the ratification? 
  [Kitovani] I am one of those who signed the Declaration of 
Georgian Independence. I went into the government from the 
national movement, I always fought for freedom, and naturally I 
would have abstained in every way. I wouldn't have voted for 
either one. 
  We should have signed it earlier, on 3 September, when 
Russia 
wasn't even demanding that we join the CIS. By signing then, we 
would have signified that we were an independent country signing 
a treaty with a neighboring state. 
  The whole world is divided into spheres of influence. 
Creating the CIS does not mean restoring the Soviet Union, it 
means shaping that sphere of influence. We should have known 
that Georgia did not and could not escape that sphere. Some big 
state would have swallowed up our little country, and neither 
the United States nor Europe had the kind of influence on Russia 
to keep us a separate entity, an independent country. We should 
have accepted our fate of remaining under Russia's influence. 
  The examples of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan should 
teach 
us something. And Uzbekistan thinks that Russia is the guarantor 
of peace in Central Asia. Russia would not let Georgia go, 
because of our geopolitical position. History confirms this. 
  [Saneblidze] If I understand you correctly, a Georgia 
without 
Russia is inconceivable, a fantasy, mere populism. People are 
saying that you have met with one party leader who refuses to 
think of Georgia as an independent country and believes that at 
best Georgia should be a Russian gubernia. Did you really meet 
Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Kitovani] I did in fact meet Zhirinovskiy. I got a call 
from 
some friends in the Urals, including Sergey Lvov (they are all 
old dissidents), who know him well, and through them he and I 
met one another in the Mir Hotel, where he has an office. We had 
an interesting conversation. Incidentally, he showed me the 
Georgia-Russia Treaty document, which he was against; he is 
especially against Russia helping Georgia. He said, "I can't 
support that treaty; you said you want to quit, so go, and 
Russia isn't going to give you any help. Our party, and our 
faction in the Duma, will oppose ratification of the treaty in 
Parliament." 
  [Saneblidze] Did you meet him to try to persuade him to 
support the treaty in the State Duma? 
  [Kitovani] Yes. 
  [Saneblidze] He's against it.... 
  [Kitovani] Yes he is. We knew that, and that's why I met 
with 
him. He gave me a copy of his book "Posledniy brosok na yug" 
[The Last Surge to the South], where he presents a precise 
outline of his conception of dividing up the world. Everything 
he writes there is nonsense, but there is a lot behind that 
nonsense. Zhirinovskiy is not alone; his allies are the 
politicians who are interested in carrying out their policies 
and suppressing Georgia. 
  [Saneblidze] Do you mean Georgian politicians? 
  [Kitovani] Yes, Georgians, and, in particular, others as 
well. He is backed by a rather well known gang of four. I won't 
name names, because some neighboring countries may take offense, 
countries which are fighting us, smiling to our face and digging 
our grave behind our backs. They also include people who have 
been financing him. 
  [Saneblidze] This move of yours--talking with Zhirinovskiy, 
which, for understandable reasons, was not advertised (our 
readers only recently found out)--was it by any decision of some 
parliamentary commission, an assignment by the government, or 
your personal initiative? 
  [Kitovani] You know, as a member of Parliament who is 
concerned for our country's fate I probably have the most right 
to look into such a situation. I am not one of those deputies 
who care only about being a deputy. You are well aware that when 
the nation's fate was in the balance, I alone decided my 
nation's fate; I had no ally to stand by my side, and I am still 
making my own decisions. Our embassy's working conditions are 
difficult; they don't know what's going on here, there's no 
intelligence effort going on. For example, they don't know what 
orientation local political circles are taking. There is much we 
should have known earlier, because it is here that the fate of 
various countries--and perhaps the world--is being decided. 
Since Georgia's fate is being decided here, we ought to have 
taken more interest in Moscow. 
  [Saneblidze] Do you think that the parliament vice speaker 
and the group of parliamentarians who came to meet with their 
Russian colleagues should have done that earlier? 
  [Kitovani] Of course they should have started that earlier, 
back when we were at the pinnacle and had the Abkhazian 
situation won. We lost time, we were too late. Meanwhile, people 
like Zhirinovskiy consolidated their position, as did Ardzinba, 
and powerful intermediaries financed them. Not one of our 
politicians gave thought to the idea that many things could take 
a turn for the worse against us in Moscow. Water wears down the 
stone drop by drop, you know. It was like that here, exactly. 
While the war in Abkhazia went on for a year and two months, 
they were doing their business here. They had the press in their 
pocket, and they did a lot of work with the military people. We 
used to work with the military ourselves, but after that--well, 
you know what happened. 
  [Saneblidze] On the subject of Abkhazia, I have a question. 
During the Sochi negotiations, at a very critical time, General 
Grachev offered our side the use of Russia's military forces. We 
refused. If you had been Defense Minister then, what decision 
would you have made? 
  [Kitovani] You're referring to the 10 September meeting. 
Both 
Karkarashvili and the head of state made a big mistake. They 
admit that themselves. They should have accepted Grachev's 
offer. Abkhazia would still be ours today. Russian troop units 
would have come in as a force to stop the fighting, after which 
we should have started talks to regain the territory beyond the 
Gumista and place it under our jurisdiction. Of course they 
should have accepted it. I learned from certain sources that 
right after the refusal, Grachev flew off and immediately gave 
the order for the troops to return. 
  [Saneblidze] Let's get back to Zhirinovskiy. There have been 
press reports of a split in Zhirinovskiy's party and his 
parliamentary faction, reports of serious opposition to him. Did 
you also meet with representatives of the opposition? 
  [Kitovani] Of course I did. The opposition members are my 
friends. Very serious efforts are being made against him, and 
cracks have appeared in his policies and in the faction; one 
group has split off and is fighting him. My reason for staying 
here is to enlist these forces to put Zhirinovskiy in the same 
fix which he planned for us. The democrats here have not yet 
consolidated their positions, but the future is theirs. 
  Another reason for my coming to Moscow was to implement the 
proposal to create CIS countries' peace-keeping forces. These 
countries' military coordination center represents virtually 
nothing. Each country will have to create such troops. We have 
experience of that kind in Georgia, for example when we and 
Russia together created joint peace-keeping forces in Samachablo. 
  [Saneblidze] Such troops need to have the necessary weapons 
and equipment; we probably should join the peace-keeping troops 
with our own share of weapons. What did you all leave to the 
Georgian army? 
  [Kitovani] War destroys and wrecks everything.... I'll tell 
you what we left the army--112 tanks, for example. There were 
200 tanks in all of Transcaucasia. Half of them were ours. Also 
12 aircraft, about 30 helicopters, about 24,000 or 26,000 
machine guns, and ammunition for more than six echelons. Over 
100 million rounds have been fired. Georgia had a pretty 
powerful mobile force then. 
  [Saneblidze] You said that war destroys everything, but has 
it really destroyed so much that practically nothing is left? 
  [Kitovani] The Abkhazians received quite a lot of power, and 
with the confrontation of these forces a lot of equipment was 
burned on both sides. The ammunition which we had was supposed 
to be enough for a 500-kilometer zone. With that potential, we 
should have been able to win anywhere. 
  [Saneblidze] The Defense Ministry's archives have been 
sealed. Do you think some criminal actions might come to light? 
  [Kitovani] That's ruled out, because during my time the 
Defense Ministry carried out no criminal transactions. I didn't 
take part in any financial transactions. It is not a Trade 
Ministry, with something to buy or sell. During my time, for 
example, not a single ruble was spent to purchase weapons. 
Everything we had was either a gift or had been transferred to 
us. 
  The Abkhazian War cost about 75 billion rubles, and the 
things which I acquired for the Georgian Army--this is the 
truth--add up to more than 100 billion dollars. Every rocket 
that flies costs 7,000 dollars, so you can imagine how many 
dollars were shot off into the sky. The three air facilities 
which fell into the hands of the Abkhazians each cost 7 billion 
dollars. The equipment and weapons that were transferred to us 
were worth a total of 105 billion dollars. 
  [Saneblidze] Irakli Batiashvili, the former chairman of the 
former Information and Intelligence Service, stated emphatically 
in IVERIA-EKSPRESI that General Sufyan Bepbayev--that is, the 
Transcaucasian Military District--had turned dilapidated tanks 
over to you. 
  [Kitovani] There were no dilapidated tanks. When we 
retreated 
from Abkhazia, we moved over into Svanetia in order to avert a 
civil war, bypassing Zugdidi. Those tanks were operating at an 
elevation of 3,600 meters. If they had been dilapidated they 
couldn't have gone that high. But equipment requires 
maintenance, repairs, someone to take charge. Without 
maintenance your own car would fall apart. 
  [Saneblidze] He also says that during the events of 
December-January you were armed by the Transcaucasian Military 
District, so that you could fight the Gamsakhurdia regime, and 
that it was they who dictated the idea of the coup to you and 
had you carry it out. 
  [Kitovani] I beg your pardon! We began to oppose 
Gamsakhurdia 
when he sided with the communist putsch in August 1991. On 19 
August the Guard refused to obey the red putsch and the orders 
of the president, who disbanded the Guard and took to the woods. 
Everyone knows that the military people took the side of the 
GKChP [the State Emergency Committee during the coup of August 
1991], and why would they help us in the fight against their 
ally Gamsakhurdia? Our only goal was to defend democracy, and 
ultimately democracy won in Russia and we won in Georgia. 
  [Saneblidze] He also said that Russian soldiers were 
fighting 
in your ranks in December-January.... 
  [Kitovani] No way. Name one Russian who died in that--but 
the 
fighting sure took the lives of a lot of Georgian boys! Do you 
think bullets don't hit Russians? At that time we had quite a 
lot of money, Russian troops were demoralized and were selling 
off everything while we bought machine guns and ammunition. 
  [Saneblidze] You used to have good relations with the top 
brass of the Russian Army. Is that what people have in mind when 
they talk about arming you? 
  [Kitovani] You know, Grachev was with me before he became 
Defense Minister, and we had good relations. Human contacts like 
that are much more effective than official ones. When they gave 
us that tank division, did they give one to any other country? 
It was for my sake, for the sake of forming a new Defense 
Ministry, that they officially gave us the 108 tanks of the 
Akhaltsikhe Division. 
  It is also not the case that we looked fondly upon them. 
They 
borrowed certain ideas from us too. I was the first one in the 
territory of the former Soviet Union to use cannons in the 
center of a city, when we fired on Government House. And last 
October, when the Russian Army was having trouble in the battle 
against Rutskoy's and Khasbulatov's forces ensconced in the 
White House, they said, Let's use Kitovani's method. And, you 
recall, they fired on the White House and made them give in. 
  [Saneblidze] When are you coming back to Georgia? 
  [Kitovani] In a while. Right now I have to go to the Urals; 
certain people are waiting for me there. Incidentally, the 
situation is tense there. I'll go, look around, and meet with 
workers and Cossacks who have requested a visit from me and with 
whom I have good relations. 
  [Saneblidze] Your travelling and your stay in Moscow take a 
lot of money. Is someone financing you? 
  [Kitovani] Of course. I have friends who are helping me 
financially. It's a little depressing that rumors are being 
spread about me in Tbilisi, but maybe it's a good thing; at 
least they remember me. 
  P.S. Back in Tbilisi I called him in Moscow: 
  "People are saying that you met Dudayev, Shanibov, 
Kobalia...." 
  "Why would I do that?! Nothing of the kind took place. 
I had gone to Yekaterinburg and Chelyabinsk. I came to Moscow 
yesterday, the 22nd. There was a television report here about my 
unofficial visit."

<F P=106> [Article by Sirje Niitra: "Agricultural Exports To Russia </F>
Coming to a Stop"] 
  [Text] 
  Due to the fact that, as of March 15, Russia imposed 
customs tariffs on the three Baltic states that are considerably 
higher than those for all other European countries, the export 
of agricultural products to Russia has come to a virtual halt, 
as producers and processors of these products are looking for a 
way out. 
  Gathered for a meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture 
yesterday were representatives of district governments, the 
Farmers' Union, producers associations, meat and dairy 
industries, and other persons linked to the export of 
agricultural products, to discuss the situation that has emerged 
and to come up with measures for overcoming it. 
<H5>  Scattering of Producers Hampers Trade </H5>
  Agriculture Minister Jaan Leetsar said that, considering the 
conditions imposed on us by Russia, producers of agricultural 
products must orient themselves, more than ever before, to the 
Western market where fluctuations are never that steep. 
  "There are enough foreign companies willing to make 
long-term 
agreements, but it is the scattering of producers that holds 
things back, making it difficult to come up with a decent volume 
for such an agreement," the minister said. He complained that 
Estonia's market is not too well supplied with domestic butter, 
milk or meat, and that the situation has deteriorated since the 
beginning of the year. 
  Mati Rillo, executive director of the Rakvere meat packing 
plant, saw things in a less negative light. He said that the 
plant has marketed most of its production in Estonia, and that 
its export portion is very small. "Making things worse, however, 
is the fact that price increases for animal supplies and hence 
also, the cost of production, coincided with the increase in 
customs tariffs," the director remarked. The only way out, as 
seen by Rillo, would be reducing customs fees by means of 
international negotiations, and forming a uniform exporting 
organization. 
  Same was offered by Lembit Kivisild, director of the Tallinn 
meat packing plant, who further opined that the relative share 
of Baltic states on the Russian market is too small to have an 
effect on the prices there. "Nevertheless, Russia's market is 
important to us, and we have to deal with it. At this time, I 
cannot see a team capable of forming an exporting organization," 
Kivisild explained. In his estimation, the price of Estonian 
pork is too high for the Western market, and would have to be 
reduced. 
<H5>  Butter Exports Hampered By Estonian Laws </H5>
  Speaking of difficulties relating to the export of butter 
Tarmo Teder, director of Tartu's Refrigeration Plant, said that 
a hampering effect comes from Estonia's own laws. Thus, the 
plant could send out the production of several dairy processors, 
but cannot buy it up because of the sales tax. "We simply do not 
have the money for sales tax--seven to nine million--to tie up 
for a month-and-a-half, even though the taxation office would 
reimburse it later," Teder explained. 
  Udo Puust, director of Tallinn's Refrigeration Plant, 
demanded that import tariffs be levelled on food items being 
imported that are filling up the plant right now. Thus, he 
thought, that cutting out imported ice cream, for example, would 
immediately increase the consumption of milk and cream. In the 
near future, he added, a large quantity of butter will be going 
to Kazakhstan from the Tallinn Refrigeration Plant.

<F P=106> [Summary of report from Economic Desk: "Cost of Living </F>
Jumped in March"] 
  [Text] 
  According to the Bureau of Statistics, the March cost 
of living index went up 8.9 percent, compared to February. Such 
a high level of inflation was last noted during the final months 
of 1992. 
  After the extensive wave of price increases on March 1, we 
predicted a significant increase in the cost of living for 
March, even when writing about the change in the consumer price 
index for February. And that's the way it went: After going up 
by 5.2 percent in February, the index went up by 8.9 percent in 
March. 
  The biggest impact to push up the cost of living came from 
increases in the shelter, water and sewer prices taking effect 
March 1. Expenditures for shelter make up close to one fifth 
(19.7 percent) of the shopping basket, and these went up by as 
much as 18.5 percent in March. Also considerable--9.7 
percent--was the increases in the price of transportation and 
communications services, while these services make up 13 percent 
of all goods and services. 
  On the whole, the bulk of the increase in the consumer price 
index for March came from services. These went up 15.5 percent, 
while prices of manufactured goods increased by 1.5 percent, on 
the average, and food items by 7.5 percent. 
  Of the different goods, the biggest increases were noted for 
fish products (21.3 percent) and milk (20.5 percent). Fruit and 
vegetable prices went up 8 percent, shortening 7.1 percent and 
meat 3.5 percent. The only decrease was noted for the price of 
eggs--down by 16.1 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Agnes JÆurgens: "Negotiations Pave Way to </F>
 the 
European Market"] 
  [Text] 
  Free trade negotiations are taking place between 
Estonia and the European Union. The round of talks concluded in 
Tallinn yesterday was considered unofficial by the European 
Union because participation was limited to experts. It will 
count as a full round nevertheless, in relation to the entire 
negotiation process, said Foreign Ministry's vice chancellor 
Priit Kolbre, who headed the Estonian delegation. 
  The negotiations held in Tallinn lasted for two days. Talks 
on the competition law and custums issues proceeded without any 
major debate. The competition law of the Republic of Estonia was 
formulated to conform to the legal framework established by the 
European Union, and this is why it was considered compatible. 
The group of customs experts, however, formulated two protocols. 
One of them establishes mutual aid between the customs 
organizations of the European Union and those of Estonia, 
consisting mainly of exchanging legislative information. The 
other protocol touches on the regulations of the free trade 
agreement, and provides for setting up some additional 
conditions for us. 
  Much more difficult is the progress of talks dealing with 
concessions for bringing textile and agricultural products into 
the countries of the European Union. The Tallinn round of talks 
did not deal directly with the textile issue, because experts in 
this area could not come here. However, the request of the 
Estonian delegation to that effect was submitted. 
  In the area of agricultural production, it so happens that 
the states of the European Union have the same exact production 
as we do. This is why there is no interest in the import of our 
food items. According to Ruve Shank, vice chancellor at the 
Ministry of Agriculture, our side had prepared a listing of 100 
products, for which we requested concessions. This was 
considered unrealistic by the experts of the European Union, 
both for its number of items and for its volume. The EU experts, 
for example, consider it unrealistic to apply special 
concessions for the export of 300 tonnes of pork, which 
represents roughly the annual requirement for one restaurant. 
Estonia's proposed exports to Europe call for 15,000 tonnes of 
milk powder and 3,000 tonnes of cheese. Even these amounts are 
supposedly too large despite the fact that, back in 1938, 
Estonia used to export 15,000 tonnes of butter to the European 
countries. 
  Out of the hundred items on the list, the Estonian 
delegation 
was allowed to retain about 20. Discussions on these will 
continue during the negotiations set for May 19 and 20. 
  There was also talk about applying protective measures on 
Estonia's borders. The European Union, the experts think, can do 
that. The final decision will have to be made by the government 
of the Republic of Estonia and Ruve Shank thinks that these 
restrictions will have to be applied to some products anyhow, 
because we want to join the European Union. 
  Clyde Kull, Republic of Estonia's embassador in Brussels, 
thought that free trade negotiations between Estonia and the 
European Union show that Estonia is regarded as a serious 
partner. In his opinion, the joining of the Baltic states with 
the European Union may take place before the turn of the century. 
  The free trade agreement takes effect in January of 1995 
and, 
in that context, we are already a part of European Union's free 
trade zone.

<F P=106> [Summary of report from Business Desk: "Economic Barometer </F>
At a Standstill"] 
  [Text] 
  Estonia's Institute of Economic Projections [EKI] 
conducted several surveys in March to find out how entrepreneurs 
in industry, construction and trade rate the economic conditions 
within their sector and within their company. They were also 
asked to give their projections for the upcoming quarter. 
<H5>  Industry's First Quarter Was Not Successful </H5>
  One hundred and seventy four companies responded to EKI's 
industrial barometer. It revealed that the beginning of this 
year was not as successful for Estonia's industry as was the 
fourth quarter of last year. The volume of production had to be 
reduced by 28 percent of the companies responding to the survey 
(by 21 percent during the previous quarter); it was increased by 
27 percent (46 percent), and stayed at the same level for 45 
percent (33 percent) of the companies. 
  The biggest setback occurred in the building materials 
industry. At the same time, the sewing, footwear, timber and 
furniture industries were relatively successful. 
  Cited most frequently among factors hampering production 
were 
difficulties in marketing and low demand for goods. This was 
pointed out by 59 percent of the companies responding, primarily 
those producing building materials, food items and machinery. 
Increased demand for their production was reported by 41 percent 
of the companies, which included a 36 percent increase in the 
demand for exports. 
  During the first quarter, the problem of raw materials 
intensified even further: reserves of raw materials were rated 
as being too low by 43 percent of the companies responding 
(compared to 36 percent in December). This is linked to the 
shortage of available funds which was also not alleviated, 
compared to the previous quarter, and which was cited by 29 
percent of the companies as a factor hampering production. 
  On the whole, the state's industry started out the new year 
with the same problems it had at the conclusion of the previous 
one. The only thing that changed was their intensity by the 
different sectors of industry. 
  Nevertheless, the new quarter was seen in an optimistic 
light 
by the respondents in March. An increased production volume, 
compared to the first quarter, was projected, and that by 55 
percent of the companies. Only 4 percent of them thought that 
the decline will continue. 
  The possibilities for exporting their production were seen 
to 
be holding at the same level by 67 percent of the respondents. 
And, as many as 64 percent of the companies producing building 
materials, anticipate increasing their exports. 
  Most (80 percent) of the companies plan to retain their 
employees. Reductions in their labor force, however, are planned 
by 42 percent of the textile companies, and by 23 percent of the 
companies in electronics and electronic technology. The need for 
additional specialists was found to be greatest in the 
industries for machine construction, metal processing, timber 
and furniture. 
<H5>  Construction Market Is Unsatisfactory </H5>
  Among respondents to the March EKI survey were also 22 
construction companies. In 45 percent of these, the volume of 
business had dropped during the first quarter. The utilization 
level of production capacity, that had been at 74 percent during 
the fourth quarter of 1993, went down by another 2 percent this 
year. Insufficient demand was noted in the responses made by 30 
percent of the companies. Orders are down from the fourth 
quarter level of 1993, and they will guarantee work for only 3.8 
months (compared to four months indicated by the December 
survey). 
  Even though the barometer characterized the construction 
market unsatisfactory at the beginning of the year, projections 
of construction companies were optimistic about the second 
quarter. Close to three quarters of them anticipate increasing 
the volume of their production for new construction as well as 
renovation. These hopes are linked to increased investment 
activity among those placing the orders. Only 5 percent of those 
responding do not believe in the possibility of increasing their 
volume of production. 
  Intentions of increasing their number of employees were 
indicated by every other construction company, while 90 percent 
of those responding predict increased construction prices for 
the second quarter. 
<H5>  Quiet Season for Trade </H5>
  Despite the general drop in consumption during the first 
quarter, the economic climate was rated satisfactory by 71 
percent of the stores, 19 percent of them even rated it good. 
Cited among factors hampering expansion were insufficient demand 
(27 percent), first; shortage of selling space (20 percent), 
second; and keen competition (18 percent), third. 
  Despite the last-mentioned factor hampering sales, 77 
percent 
of the stores had increased their sales prices during the first 
quarter. At the same time, one third of the stores (including 
two thirds of the food stores) reported that retail prices 
increased faster during the first quarter than they did during 
the fourth quarter of the previous year. Actually, there were no 
food stores among those whose prices remained at last year's 
level. 
  Of all the stores responding to the survey, 26 percent 
reported that their financial situation improved during the 
first quarter, while 13 percent of them reported it had 
worsened. (Also see table for financial barometer).

  The EKI forecast calls for a considerable livening of retail 
trade in the second quarter. Improvement in business conditions 
is supported by projections made by 57 percent of the stores. No 
projections called for worsening. There were also no projections 
for any decreases in prices. To the contrary--two thirds are 
predicting the same rate of price increases as was experienced 
during the first quarter.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jurgis Jurgelis, General Director of the </F>
State Department of Security, by Ramune Sakalauskaite; place and 
date not given: "Security Service Chief Knows Quite a Bit, But 
Doesn't Say Much"] 
  [Text] On 20 January 1994, LIETUVOS RYTAS published an 
investigative report which provided quite a few critical facts 
about the activities of the country's security service. The week 
before last, Seimas adopted the law governing the State 
Department of Security. The name of the service was also changed 
at the same time. 
  Compared to previous heads of the Department of Security, 
51-year-old Jurgis Jurgelis, the current general director, has 
headed this service the longest. He is the eighth head of the 
service, having been preceded in the post by M. Laurinkus, D. 
Arlauskas, V. Zedelis, Z. Vaisvila, B. Gajauskas, P. Plumpa, and 
K. Mickevicius. 
  This LIETUVOS RYTAS journalist talked about the activities 
of 
the service with Jurgis Jurgelis, General Director of the State 
Department of Security. 
  [Sakalauskaite] Can you either confirm or deny published 
press reports that a great deal of specialized equipment is now 
being brought into Lithuania. If this is true, is it known what 
kind of equipment is involved, and do you have information on 
who is using it? 
  [Jurgelis] In my opinion, there is a greater quantity of 
petroleum being brought in than of the products you mentioned, 
although I do not doubt that there could be and that there is a 
demand for them. Just take a look at how many protective 
services are being established in Lithuania--at banks, 
enterprises, and other institutions. And all of them want to 
have--and do have--specialized technology. Each system is being 
established independently and the protection at some banks 
outstrips the Security Service in terms of its quality, for 
example, even in its signalization technology. The technology is 
being used not only for spying, but also as a defensive measure. 
  The costs of optimally outfitting an establishment would 
reach several hundred thousand U.S. dollars. At the present 
time, when the import of specialized technology is not checked 
very much, it is pouring in in various ways. I had the 
opportunity to observe some instances--even at the state 
bank--of listening apparatus operating as a radio transmitter. 
  [Sakalauskaite] Do you have information as to which 
organizations this specialized equipment is concentrated in? 
  [Jurgelis] It is to be found in those which are involved in 
spying, protective services, and in criminal structures. 
  [Sakalauskaite] Is the State Department of Security able to 
check how criminal structures use the specialized equipment? 
  [Jurgelis] I do not know who would be capable of checking on 
them at the present time. 
  [Sakalauskaite] Does this mean that criminal groups can 
listen to what the general prosecutor is saying in his office? 
  [Jurgelis] I do not doubt that such technical possibilities 
exist. The prosecutor's windows are not screened from the 
outside. It is possible to hear what is being said in the office 
over a certain distance, based on the vibrations of the glass 
window panes. 
  [Sakalauskaite] Has the department gotten to the bottom of 
the listening equipment found in the office of R. Visokavicius, 
the former chairman of the directorate of the Bank of Lithuania? 
  [Jurgelis] This investigation was conducted by the police; I 
do not know what conclusions were reached ultimately. 
  [Sakalauskaite] In one interview, President A. Brazauskas 
appealed to the public for the return of documents removed from 
KGB headquarters. Perhaps some documents have already been 
returned? 
  [Jurgelis] I haven't heard of even a single sheet being 
returned. At any rate, I am certain that there will be no flood 
of people returning documents. 
  [Sakalauskaite] Is the service conducting an investigation 
to 
try to determine who stole the documents? Is the service trying 
to get them returned? 
  [Jurgelis] We are interested in the material that the KGB 
removed after the putsch. Russian ambassador to Lithuania N. 
Obertyshev stated that his country refused to negotiate on the 
issue of the removed documents, asserting that there was no law 
governing such a procedure. I do not think that a law is needed 
to have something returned that was stolen. The KGB removed the 
documents at a point in time after independence was 
reestablished. Russia is also not returning historical documents 
of the pre-war Lithuanian security service. These documents 
contain information about historical, pre-war personages. The 
ambassador's statement notwithstanding, a discussion of the 
issue should still be initiated. I understand that Russia is 
afraid that we will learn about the entire secret service that 
worked in our country. That is why they also do not want to 
return operational materials in which Russia's interests are 
reflected. 
  I already had information after the putsch about the removal 
of the documents from the KGB building. I have no doubt 
whatsoever that R. Baltusis, a national defense department 
worker (who is an alumnus of the Klaipeda nautical school, the 
former head of the Klaipeda motorized troop batallion, holds the 
rank of major, and whom the Ministry of Defense sent on a 
training internship to the United States--R.S.), and S. Simkus, 
who earlier worked in the security department, were involved 
when the files were stolen. And incidentally, a third, still 
unidentified person, participated in the operation as well. The 
files were transported by automobile. There are no doubts 
regarding the participation by the aforementioned individuals in 
the theft or the fact of the theft itself. There were witnesses 
at the time, the majority of whom changed their testimony after 
some time. It subsequently turned out that 11-12 bags of 
material from Section I (foreign intelligence) were stolen. It 
is possible that there is information in there about scientists 
and artists who traveled throughout the world and provided the 
security service with written accounts of their travels. 
  Criminal proceedings were brought as a result of the 
aforementioned thefts, but they were cancelled when there was a 
lack of evidence, because some individuals, as I mentioned, 
changed their accounts. When I was a member of the Supreme 
Council commission investigating the activities of the KGB, I 
associated with witnesses who related how specific individuals 
packed bags, carried them, opened the gates, and removed the 
load. We also knew about a conversation between the individuals 
who were guarding the building and the individuals who were 
transporting the bags. There were also some minor thefts. Other 
new things are becoming known as well. However, when compared 
with the trucksful removed to Russia, the thefts by Lithuanians 
are not major ones. There is no doubt that the KGB files went 
astray into private hands. 
  [Sakalauskaite] Are you aware of people being blackmailed 
with the stolen files? 
  [Jurgelis] Yes, I have heard that there were attempts to do 
this. 
  [Sakalauskaite] Democratic countries have analytical 
services 
which strive to predict events in their own as well as in other 
countries. Has such an institution been established in 
Lithuania, how many people work there, and who receives its 
product? 
  [Jurgelis] An analytical section has been established in the 
department. Although quite a few people work there, it is not 
sufficiently strong. Salaries are not large, and there is a lack 
of specialists. The section collects and analyzes both official 
and public information. All countries have such sections within 
their security services. Another section processes operational 
material. If one wants to have a complete picture, the analysts' 
material has to be merged with the results obtained by the 
operational section. In accordance with the law, we provide 
information to the Presidency, the Government, and the 
prosecutor's office. We could perhaps also provide some open 
information to members of Seimas as well, but this is not 
outlined in the law. 
  [Sakalauskaite] A reorganization was supposed to start in 
the 
service you head at the end of last year. Has the process of 
change concluded? What are some of the more distinct changes and 
innovations? 
  [Jurgelis] It was thought at the end of last year that the 
law governing the Security Department would be adopted. However, 
the deliberation and the adoption of the law dragged out over 
more than three sessions. When I arrived to head the service, 
some were actively proposing to start a reorganization, even 
though there had been very many such reorganizations up to that 
time. It isn't smart to proceed as at times in the past, when 
the goal was solely to let people go, because after receiving 
their notice of dismissal, they will do no work the remaining 
two months. I never considered a personnel reorganization, when 
the goal is to let certain people go and to accept others. The 
law grants me the right to handle personnel in a way that 
protects the service's interests. The primary reasons for 
dismissing someone from his position are deteriorating health, 
loss of confidence, loss of citizenship, renunciation of one's 
oath. 
  [Sakalauskaite] The press has reported that former political 
prisoners previously worked in the service. Is this tradition 
being continued, have you succeeded in structuring the system in 
such a way that political parties or movements would not exert 
an influence on your workers? 
  [Jurgelis] I believe that very different types of people can 
work in the department. What they were before is not important; 
what is important is what they are now. The service is obligated 
to be depoliticized. Former political prisoners work in our 
service now, too. At present there are almost no more factual 
reports of workers who are influenced by parties or social 
movements. 
  [Sakalauskaite] Last year, Russian special services detained 
a couple of Estonian intelligence officers. We are not aware of 
any reports of Lithuanians being trapped by Russian 
counterintelligence. Do we not have any such officers, or are 
they working very skillfully? 
  [Jurgelis] Let the Russian special services fish for our 
intelligence officers and believe that we have them. In fact, 
keeping intelligence officers stationed abroad is very 
expensive. The majority of information can be obtained via 
official channels. 
  [Sakalauskaite] Why didn't the Security department react to 
published stories in the press about U.S. intelligence offices 
that have been established in Lithuania? Did you learn about 
this fact from the press? If not, what more can you tell us 
about the activities in Lithuania by the U.S. and the 
corresponding services of other countries? 
  [Jurgelis] Since I do not have sufficient information on 
this 
issue, I would not want to talk about it. 
  [Sakalauskaite] Can you confirm or deny stories that 
Lithuanian security has information about residents and 
intelligence officers of foreign countries working here, but is 
not undertaking any action against them because it doesn't know 
how to deal with them? 
  [Jurgelis] We have information about intelligence activities 
in Lithuania by certain foreign countries, but I would not care 
to detail them for the press. 
  [Sakalauskaite] I have heard that before the war, Lithuanian 
security had recruited a newspaper editor for 400 litas a month. 
Do you have reliable, or perhaps even more closely linked people 
among journalists? What are the financial arrangements with them? 
  [Jurgelis] We do not have any such journalists. This kind of 
connection is quite widely used in the world, even at the 
highest levels. 
  [Sakalauskaite] According to Dutch law, each citizen of the 
country has the right to know how much of the money allocated to 
the special services is spent on listening gear, on intelligence 
officers, and on other requirements. Does Lithuania intend to 
adopt similar measures? 
  [Jurgelis] The decision by the Seimas to announce--when 
approving the budget--how funds would be spent, including funds 
allocated to the security department, exceeds in terms of its 
democratic nature the standard used in most Western countries. 
On the other hand, will a security service that is defending the 
interests of a country make information public that is useful 
for the special services of foreign countries? I do not believe 
that all information about funds ought to be published. I am not 
contending that there should be no control over how funds are 
used. The Seimas National Security Committee currently executes 
oversight functions. I believe that a confidential oversight 
service ought to be created. 
  [Sakalauskaite] At a press conference that took place at the 
beginning of the year, you informed us about presumptions that 
the remains of bishop V. Borisevicius and about a thousand other 
victims of torture by the NKVD in 1944-1947 might be buried on 
the outlying estate of Tuskulenai (on the grounds of the 
Interior Ministry's House of Culture and Sport). Has the version 
of events which you mentioned proven to be correct? 
  [Jurgelis] Yes. We have not yet done any excavating, but I 
am 
certain that about a thousand people are buried on the grounds 
of the outlying estate of Tuskulenai, people who were sentenced 
to death and shot or who were brought in from the outlying 
districts around Vilnius as resistance fighters who had died. 
  [Sakalauskaite] On what basis do you draw such conclusions? 
  [Jurgelis] I am relying on our sources of information that 
we 
will reveal at the appropriate time. In acordance with the 
established order of things at that time, a sentence would be 
carried out in the prison cells at KGB headquarters, and the 
corpses would be transported to the outlying estate of 
Tuskulenai, which was surrounded by a fence. 
  I believe that we will succeed in determining the identities 
of the buried and to announce who executed the sentence. We 
expect to begin excavations at the end of April or beginning of 
May.

<F P=106> [Interview with Algirdas Brazauskas, President of Lithuania, </F>
by Boris Pyadyshev, editor-in-chief of MEZHDUNARODNAYA ZHIZN, 
time and occasion not given] 
  [Text] The President of Lithuania does not have an 
official residence. Part of the Seimas building is rented for 
the head of state. 
  Brazauskas has spent more than one year in this office. 
He arrived here when he was elected chairman of the Presidium of 
the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR in January 1990. After 
the elections in the fall of 1992 Brazauskas became chairman of 
the Seimas and acting President of the Lithuanian Republic, 
which brought him back to this office. On 14 February 1993, 
receiving 60 percent of the votes in the election, Brazauskas 
took the post of President of Lithuania. 
  [Pyadyshev] Russia's relations with the Baltic republics are 
far from happy. Against this general background there is more 
tranquility and realism in Russian-Lithuanian affairs. The 
fundamental issues of mutual relations were already settled last 
year. 
  The surface layer of Russian-Lithuanian relations is, 
however, fragile. There was a recent flare-up because of delay 
in implementation of the agreement on trade and economic 
relations. You, Mr. President, are complaining that you have 
been unsuccessful in trying to get a call through to the 
Kremlin. You sent a message to the Russian President about this. 
Your displeasure flowed over into your speech in the 
parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. 
  [Brazauskas] The evening before my visit to Strasbourg, 
where 
I spoke in the parliament of the Council of Europe, I talked by 
telephone with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. It was a 
constructive conversation. I also exchanged messages with 
President Boris Yeltsin. I think that there are possibilities of 
eliminating those difficulties in our relations that have 
appeared recently. 
  Overall the present state of relations between Lithuania and 
Russia, despite the existing difficulties, can be described as 
good. They are developing in the direction outlined by the 29 
July 1991 treaty and the 30 August 1993 Joint Declaration of the 
Presidents of Russia and Lithuania. 
  The visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to 
Lithuania, during which a whole package of 10 agreements was 
signed, was also very important. One of the main agreements was 
the trade and economic agreement on most favored nation status. 
Unfortunately, it has not gone into effect yet. Lithuania has 
fulfilled its treaty obligations; now it is Russia's turn. It is 
mutually disadvantageous and unprofitable that, even though the 
treaty has been signed, the name of Lithuania is not found in 
the long list of more than 130 countries with which Russia 
carries on free trade and trade on a most favored nation basis. 
In my opinion, there is no future in that kind of economic 
pressure. 
  [Pyadyshev] Moscow has its own reason for this. You were 
exactly right that the agreements signed constitute a package 
and thus should be realized as a package, in an integrated 
manner. As I understand it, what they are waiting for from the 
Lithuanian side is a solution to issues related to the vitality 
of Kaliningrad Oblast, above all the question of transit travel. 
  [Brazauskas] It is natural that Russia wants to serve some 
of 
its interests related to Kaliningrad Oblast by collaboration 
with Lithuania. This includes the movement of people and transit 
shipment of various goods and freight across Lithuanian 
territory. In addition, most of the electricity and food 
consumed in the oblast is produced in Lithuania. We both have an 
interest in formalizing these and other areas of collaboration 
in agreements and treaties. Thus, many of the 10 
Lithuanian-Russian agreements signed on 18 November 1993 
concerned Kaliningrad Oblast directly. 
  In Lithuania you hear arguments about the future status of 
Kaliningrad Oblast and revision of the decisions of the Potsdam 
Conference fairly often in the press and even in the statements 
of some political figures. They question Russian sovereignty 
over Kaliningrad Oblast and clearly go beyond scholarly debate. 
I can assure you that this is not the position of Lithuania. 
  However, we are not indifferent to the future political and 
economic development of the oblast. I will not deny that we 
would like it better if Russia developed this oblast in the 
direction of Hong Kong (a free trade-economic zone), and not 
like, for example, Gibraltar (a military fortress). We are happy 
that at present, despite the well-known troubles with placement 
of Russian troops being withdrawn from Europe, both Moscow and 
Kaliningrad are more inclined to the first alternative. 
  Polish President Lech Walesa recently visited Vilnius. He 
and 
I exchanged opinions about transit traffic to Kaliningrad 
Oblast; by land, of course, it goes either through Lithuania or 
through Poland. Our opinion was the same: if transit traffic is 
carried on in conformity with the laws of the sovereign 
countries, following international rules, and if it is 
economically beneficial, it can only be welcomed and will prove 
advantageous to the corresponding countries. But if we are 
talking about uncontrolled transit traffic, about some kind of 
corridors (for understandable reasons this word sounds harsh to 
the ears of our Polish partners), that is an entirely different 
matter. That is unacceptable. 
  [Pyadyshev] Most of the people in Russia think that in 
Lithuania, unlike the situation in some other countries, there 
are basically no problems on the state and political levels with 
ensuring the rights of the Russian-speaking population. 
  [Brazauskas] Yes, the postwar demographic, social, and 
economic development, finally, plus the historical tolerance in 
Lithuanian society, have not created ethnic problems in 
Lithuania. We have been able to move to so-called positive 
discrimination in relation to ethnic minorities in some fields. 
This means that more favorable conditions are created for the 
ethnic minorities than for the main people. We intend to hold to 
this policy in the future as well. 
  We have the following demographic ratio: 80 percent 
Lithuanians and 9 percent Russians. We do not see any problems. 
And what is being done in Latvia and Estonia? I simply cannot 
justify the fact that such unacceptable measures for our 
democratic world are being adopted there. But on the other hand, 
why can't we understand this attitude, when only about half the 
people left are Latvians? In general, the question arises: What 
is an ethnic minority? 
  [Pyadyshev] All states, large and small, are equal before 
God 
and before the U.N. Charter. But we must take account of the 
historical fate of each country, its geopolitical status... 
  [Brazauskas] The history of the Lithuanian state is very 
complex, especially the last 200 years since the third partition 
of the Rzeczpospolita [Republic] in 1795. Lithuania was a part 
of that state, and after that it belonged to Russia. Before this 
there were quite complex relations with Poland, with which 
Lithuania lived in union for some 200 years. Almost two 
centuries as part of the tsarist empire, then the Soviet Union, 
with the exception of 20 years. This left its mark. 
  I remember, not in reproach of course, Mikhail Sergeyevich 
Gorbachev, who once said to me: "Listen, what is this 
independence to you? What do you need it for? You've lived 
together with this large, great country, and you'll keep on 
living that way." 
  What does this tell us? Even people on such a high level, 
educated, enormously experienced, have difficulty understanding 
the mood and spirit of the people. Lithuania is a small country. 
We have 3 million Lithuanians in the country, and another 1 
million abroad. But our national spirit is not disappearing; it 
assists the state formation of this small people to endure its 
trials. 
  In no way do we support national states as pure-blooded 
states. We have many nationalities; that is how history 
developed. We find a common language with them. There are 
misunderstandings, of course, but they are the kind that can be 
resolved by normal methods and means. I cannot say that we are 
on the frontier. Of course, dealings with Holland, Belgium, and 
Austria are a different matter. Relations there have been 
developing for hundreds of years. 
  We are aware of the attention we are receiving, especially 
from small states, for example Denmark and the other 
Scandinavian countries. Of course, we do not wait with 
outstretched hands for someone to rescue us, to prop up our 
life. We figure to satisfy 2-5 percent of our needs with 
assistance. Everything else we must do ourselves. 
  [Pyadyshev] After a certain period of silence the United 
States and other Western countries have returned to their former 
arguments about Russia's imperial ambitions, by which they mean 
the interests of present-day Russia in the regions of the former 
Soviet Union. One wonders: What is news about that, that Russia 
really has its own interests in territories with which it was 
joined in the USSR and in which many connecting lines have 
remained--economic, political, cultural, and ethnic? It would be 
strange if people were talking about the absence of such 
interests. Moreover, some are saying, with good grounds, that a 
risky situation would be created if Russia were to renounce its 
special interests in these regions. 
  [Brazauskas] I agree with you that there are such interests. 
But when a high-ranking Russian official states that the Baltic 
countries are the near abroad, that is a different matter. You 
cannot stop and leave the field open for each person to 
speculate and interpret these interests in his own way. But the 
way you put it, I agree. 
  Lithuania also has interests in Russia. And they are not at 
all aggressive. Normal neighborly relations in a very broad 
spectrum. Mr. Viktor Chernomyrdin, Mr. Andrey Kozyrev, and Mr. 
Pavel Grachev have also sat at this table. In my opinion we 
found a common language. We found agreement and discussed 
matters. 
  Of course, over 50 years the economic integration was 
enormous, and a policy of deep specialization, large-scale 
construction projects, and large enterprises was followed. We 
continue to feel this today. Those kinds of interests I 
understand. 
  But you know, when a high official talks about permanent 
interests in the Baltic region it leads me to various thoughts. 
There are people who are using this for their own ends. The 
discussion here must, of course, be carried through to the end. 
  [Pyadyshev] Apparently you have in mind the RF minister of 
foreign affairs' speech at a meeting at the ministry. An uproar 
began after that, but explanations were later given. 
  [Brazauskas] When things are explained "later," it often 
fails to achieve the desired end... 
  [Pyadyshev] It was clarified that the journalist who 
attended 
the meeting had presented the minister's words inaccurately. 
  [Brazauskas] Judge for yourself, we get information, perhaps 
distorted, but we cannot check it for ourselves. This phrase is 
used about us, the "near abroad." Basically, what does this 
mean, the near abroad? What is understood by this? 
  [Pyadyshev] I assure you that the Baltic region was not 
included in the near abroad at that meeting--and I attended 
it--or anywhere else. This term encompasses a very definite 
group of countries, which constitute the CIS... 
  But let us turn to another subject. You mentioned Mikhail 
Sergeyevich Gorbachev. How did your relations with him take 
shape when you were first secretary of the Central Committee of 
the Lithuanian Communist Party? 
  [Brazauskas] I am not the judge, of course, but it is my 
personal impression that he gave in to a rock-hard politburo. 
And did not undertake to restructure our life. Something was 
always holding him back. But life was already demanding a new 
approach, new solutions within the state, and a certain freedom 
in the activity of public and even party organizations. Where 
did it begin among us? As first secretary I made a firm demand 
that party organizations be given autonomy. But the Central 
Committee, especially the organizational department, was still 
filled with people who longed for the old days, Razumov, 
Razumovskiy, Yegor Kuzmich. 
  They always said that the politburo was a monolith, a 
monolith. But this monolith fell into pieces. If we had gone to 
a multiparty system it would not have been so dramatic. When our 
first rally was organized a shout went up to expel certain 
people from the party. Pugo gave me a list then of 10 people who 
had expressed their opinions. They sent a commission and 
terrorized us for a whole month. "Why aren't you responding 
according to the party line?" But how can you say that when life 
has completely changed? The party leadership did not see this 
or, possibly, certain people saw it but were afraid to say it. 
Finally we expelled ourselves, and then after that they expelled 
us at the politburo. 
  Incidentally, have you read my book "Divorce Lithuanian 
Style"? In it I tried to present the events of that period as 
fully as possible. 
  [Pyadyshev] How do you see the results of the Brazauskas 
presidency by the time it concludes? 
  [Brazauskas] I have only been president for a year, and of 
course, it is very difficult to guess far into the future. Today 
we can only engage in fantasy. If we are able to preserve a 
consistently working government we will achieve tangible 
results. Instability of the executive power produces poor 
results. That is my goal. Of course, we cannot avoid the 
replacement of certain ministers. But under our Constitution if 
more than half of them are replaced then the parliament must 
give the government a vote of confidence. We will have to do 
that, and we will do it. Therefore I attach great importance to 
the work of the government and to work with the government. With 
the Cabinet of Ministers. We have very close 
ties--consultations, discussions of particular issues. The prime 
minister visits me 4-5 times a week. I drop in to his office. 
That is a mandatory condition. But I never work for them and I 
do not issue any ukases, although I do have certain powers.

<F P=106> [Unsigned editorial: "The Signs of Time"] </F>
  [Text] Last Saturday Latvia signed a treaty with Russia on 
the withdrawal of that country's army, but there is no rejoicing 
in Latvia itself. It is clear to everyone that the foreign army 
had to withdraw unconditionally and without any reservations. 
Yet in concrete politics, the Latvians had to accommodate 
themselves to the realities and to make concessions to Russia. 
  Unlike in Lithuania's case, from where the Russian army was 
withdrawn without any treaty, and the only legal document was 
the withdrawal schedule, Latvia was forced to sign a treaty. 
Moreover, it will have to assume obligations in accordance with 
the protocol on social guarantees to the retired Russian 
military personnel, who had become particularly fond of Latvia. 
It is not by accident that the Latvians, who yearn for the 
quickest possible disappearance of the former empire's legacy 
from their land, are now experiencing a moral, psychological 
injury, even a humiliation, as they are compelled to take care 
also of the uninvited intruders. 
  Even after the army's withdrawal by the end of August, a 
malignant ulcer will remain for five and a half years on 
Latvia's land -- the Russian-controlled radar station at Skrunda. 
  Could Latvia have avoided the concessions, relying only on 
"justice and law?" Hardly. Envious of the Lithuanians, the 
Latvians themselves recognize that they had missed the best time 
to seek the army's withdrawal, because Russia's political 
attitudes toward the Baltic countries have undergone a distinct 
change during the last year, with the strengthening of the 
imperial and nationalistic tendencies. By the way, they might 
become a serious obstacle to the ratification of this treaty in 
the State Duma. There is no shortage of people there who want 
the Russian soldiers never to leave the so-called "near abroad" 
or wish them to remain there at least symbolically, so that in 
the future they can stage a full return. 
  Latvia's concessions (Russia has practically made no 
concessions) may become a bad precedent for the negotiations 
between Estonia and Russia. Estonia is facing the same pressing 
problems as Latvia (they differ only in their proportions). 
Therefore Estonians can hardly congratulate the Latvians, who 
have left them behind in the negotiations with Russia. The tone 
of the latter toward Estonia is becoming more and more severe; 
Russia's representatives are stating categorically that the 
remaining military units will not be withdrawn unless a treaty 
is signed and Estonia obligates itself to provide social 
guarantees for retired military personnel. 
  It goes without saying that all these problems and the new 
strategy in the relations with Russia had to be a subject of 
discussions yesterday at Jurmala, where a meeting of the 
presidents of the three Baltic countries took place. The unusual 
thing about this meeting was its confidential character, with 
even the closest advisers absent. Until now, the policies of the 
Baltic countries were being coordinated publicly; therefore, the 
emergence of confidentiality indicates the existence of certain 
problems, which are to be resolved in a closed circle. 
  The Russian army was withdrawn from Lithuania one year 
earlier than it will be evacuated from Latvia. As we rejoice 
about that fact, we rarely pose to ourselves a natural question 
-- why? Obviously, it did not happen because the Kremlin is 
especially fond of the Lithuanians and has less love to spare 
for the Latvians and the Estonians. 
  J. Paleckis, the President's adviser on international 
questions, mentioned to LIETUVOS RYTAS several factors that 
"contributed to an earlier withdrawal." First, Lithuania and 
Russia had signed a time-table for withdrawal already in the 
fall of 1992. However, Lithuania refused to sign a prepared 
treaty, which made the chairman of the Supreme Council, V. 
Landsbergis, feel that he was cheated. (Subsequently, the forces 
of the opposition in Lithuania asserted unanimously that there 
was no need whatsoever for such a treaty.) 
  Second, the international opinion, and in particular that of 
the West, supported the just demands of the Baltic countries 
(but this was equally applicable to Lithuania, Latvia and 
Estonia). 
  Third, Lithuania's moderate position and the search for 
dialogue, without responding to the psychological warfare that 
was initiated by Russia. 
  And fourth, as in sports, there was no shortage of luck. 
Otherwise, the Russian army might have remained symbolically, at 
least. 
  A more astute individual would probably not be satisfied 
with 
such reasoning. The factors mentioned above might appear as only 
the external (and smaller) tip of the iceberg, protruding above 
the water line. Time may reveal much more complex processes that 
took place behind the scenes of negotiations for the army's 
withdrawal, in the corridors of the Kremlin, the Russian 
Ministry of Defense, the General Staff, and the Western capitals. 
  It is obvious already that the emphatically good relations 
between the former minister of national defense, A. Butkevicius, 
and the Russian military leadership also contributed 
significantly to Lithuania's success. 
  The scandal, which was caused when certain circumstances of 
the purchase of weapons for the Lithuanian army came to light, 
indicates that these relations were also based on mutual 
material advantage. 
  It appears that the Latvians and the Estonians did not have 
such clever ministers and businessmen. Perhaps this is why a 
foreign army still remains in their countries?

<F P=106> [Interview with National Bank of Tatarstan Chairman Yevgeniy </F>
Bogachev by RESPUBLIKA TATARSTAN correspondent Ye. Taran; place 
and date not given: "Yevgeniy Bogachev: `Emergency Measures Are 
Needed'"] 
  [Text] [Taran] Yevgeniy Borisovich, at the recent 
conference held by the president, in the press, and at the 
latest session of the republic Supreme Soviet the issue of 
nonpayments has been raised many times. It is assumed that this 
problem will receive priority attention in the anticrisis 
program currently being drafted by the government. It is obvious 
that the nonpayments crisis is a Russia-wide phenomenon. Still, 
can this problem be resolved at least partially at republic 
level? How can the National Bank of Tatarstan help? 
  [Bogachev] At the National Bank's initiative, the republic 
government adopted a decree and prepared on its basis a statute 
on mutual clearing between producers, processors of agricultural 
products, and trade organizations. You understand that the 
nonpayments problem cannot be solved in one strike, overnight; 
therefore, on an experimental basis we intend to untangle this 
knot first in the sectors that supply the population with 
foodstuffs--bread, milk, meat, confectionery items, etc.--and 
trade. For these enterprises and organizations we introduced the 
so-called file No. 2. We established a payments schedule for 
them. First they settle accounts with the budget (pay taxes into 
it), then the pension fund, and then with producers and 
processors of agricultural products. 
  [Taran] That is, the file means that if the enterprise 
received money into its account in the bank, it is... 
  [Bogachev] ...transferred to pay taxes to the budget, to the 
pension fund, and then--to pay for agricultural products 
delivered to them. If there is not much money, not much will be 
paid. But it will get paid instead of the money just sitting 
there! 
  How were things before this decree? For instance, a rayon 
food trade administration receives money from stores, pays taxes 
to the budget, pays into dozens of various funds, pays out 
wages, and disposes of the rest of the money at its discretion. 
If it wishes, it uses it to buy imported candy or sausage, or, 
if it wishes, it will pay the Zarya factory or the meat 
combine... Now if a trade administration or food processing 
enterprise attempts to violate the procedures set by the decree, 
the banks will not allow it to do so. They will withdraw money 
from the account and send it where it is supposed to go. 
Otherwise we will not be able to get the money to the 
countryside--it will constantly be diverted along interim stages 
of the chain. 
  [Taran] If the chain links kolkhozes and sovkhozes with the 
trade sector and, in the final analysis, with the republic 
population, and is located inside Tatarstan, then you can 
probably attempt to untangle the knots using both the command 
methods envisaged in the decree and economic levers. What about 
enterprises whose suppliers and consumers are in Russia and 
other CIS countries? Or how do you settle financial relations 
between the AO [joint-stock company] Tatneft and 
Nizhnekamskneftekhim? 
  [Bogachev] Speaking of Nizhnekamskneftekhim, it is actually 
owed a lot of money by many CIS enterprises, while inside the 
republic it owes money to many suppliers. Some chains, wherever 
possible, we cut short by a bill of exchange or so-called barter 
applied to debt. For instance, the Nizhegorodskiy oil refinery 
pays the AO Tatneft for oil with gasoline; this gasoline goes to 
the Tatneftprodukty association, and we count it as payment by 
the oil producers' to the budget. By the way, the National Bank 
already has set up a commission that will look more closely at 
these chains of nonpayments and, if possible, shortcut them, 
apply mutual clearing, even extending to Russian enterprises and 
CIS countries. 
  I can even give you an example of how we untangled such a 
chain. A Chisinau tractor plant owed money to the 
Nizhnekamskneftekhim association for products shipped. We came 
to an agreement that Moldova would deliver spare parts for 
tractors to Tatselkhoztekhnika, and we would count this as 
Nizhnekamsk producer payments into the budget. 
  Most often, however, credits are needed in order to 
accomplish mutual clearing. We will be allocating resources to 
the extent possible, especially if insignificant amounts are 
needed, in order to complete mutual clearing. 
  Not everyone agrees to such mutual clearing, however. For 
instance, the Novomoskovsk plant, which produces gasoline, owes 
a substantial amount of money to Tatneft, but is in no hurry to 
pay with fuel, and in this situation offers gasoline at a price 
hiked up by 15-20 percent if we want it faster. See what is 
happening in the economy! We can demand sanctions, file a claim 
with the arbitration court, of course. But how much time this 
will take!... Meanwhile, Muscovites advise us: Do not ship the 
oil. But you cannot just stop the wells. 
  [Taran] Yevgeniy Borisovich, I understand that enterprises 
must, of course, settle accounts with the budget and 
agricultural producers. But there also is another line item on 
which calm and stability in the republic depend. I mean paying 
wages--and paying them on time. At many enterprises people have 
not been paid for three to four months. I do not know whether 
there is any truth to the rumor that 50 percent of the money 
received will be reserved specifically for paying wages. 
  [Bogachev] I cannot either confirm or deny this information. 
At the recent meeting held by the president I submitted a 
proposal for the anticrisis program: to let enterprises keep at 
minimum 5 percent of the money received for their immediate 
needs. 
  [Taran] Is this an emergency reserve? 
  [Bogachev] Yes, and no one--not the budget, not the funds, 
not the banks--can touch this money. It happens sometimes that 
an enterprise cannot send people on vacation, provide financial 
assistance, and so on. 
  This proposal was supported, and in one document there is 
even the figure of 30 percent. But if this passes, it will hit 
the budget hard. 
  [Taran] But you have to pay people, too. They have to live 
on 
something... 
  [Bogachev] Yes, there are enterprises in the republic where 
wages have not yet been paid for February, and in some kolkhozes 
and sovkhozes--for January. But overall as of 1 May the back pay 
owed amounted to 160 billion rubles [R]. This is one month's 
worth of back pay. In certain sectors, however--agriculture, the 
defense industry, light industry, the budget sphere--the arrears 
are substantial. Measures are being taken, however, to pay off 
these arrears at least through April. It looks as if we will be 
issuing credits in order to get out of this situation. 
  [Taran] Yevgeniy Borisovich, will we find credit resources? 
  [Bogachev] I will give you these figures. As of 1 January 
our 
credit resources amounted to R600 billion; as of 1 May--already 
R900 billion. I know the interest rate is very high, and it is 
hard for enterprises to carry the debt, but what can we do? Just 
recently our bank charged 210 percent interest, then 205 
percent, then 200 percent. At the latest auction we acquired 
centralized resources at 190 percent. Of course, commercial 
banks charge a higher interest rate. 
  We have to keep in mind, however, that we issue credit to 
agriculture on average at 20 percent, and to some farms--at 10 
percent. For instance, the bread products association received 
most of its credit at 10 percent. But even this money is 
difficult to get back. The enterprise ships flour and cereal, 
but the money does not come back, it gets stuck somewhere. 
Consumers do not pay. 
  [Taran] How do you explain the lowering of the Central 
Bank's 
interest rate? 
  [Bogachev] I want to remind you of the statements of Central 
Bank of Russia Chairman Gerashchenko that by the end of this 
year the interest rate will be 100 percent. But in my opinion 
even this is too much. If interest rates were no higher than 
20-30 percent, prices would go down, too. 
  The lowering of interest rates is a result of the decline in 
the inflation rate. In my opinion, there is no particular reason 
to rejoice. We have achieved it at the cost of reducing consumer 
demand--people do not have any money, they are not paid wages. 
This is the way to entirely ruin industry, which will stop 
producing any output. 
  [Taran] We were talking mostly about noncash clearing. But 
there also are quite a few problems with cash, are there not? 
  [Bogachev] The National Bank has now put into circulation 
about R600 billion in cash. Republic banks have only R21 
billion. Where is the rest of the money? I do not think it is in 
the hands of the population, because people are not being paid 
wages. It is possible that it is circulating hand-to-hand, 
bypassing the budget and other taxes. This is my first guess. 
The second is that the money is at enterprises. I do not know of 
a single instance of any manager being penalized for using cash 
in lieu of noncash transactions. When the money goes through the 
bank, taxes are withheld, along with other deductions. Quite 
often, however, enterprises get cash through their own trade 
network and immediately use it to purchase goods, pay wages, etc. 
  I am against repressive measures. The National Bank of 
Tatarstan is proposing other ways. We need to make it possible 
to buy in the market shares of profitable, prestigious 
enterprises and banks, without restrictions, for money. Right 
now, however, many banks are privately-held joint-stock 
companies. But if enterprises have the money (the R600 billion 
is sitting around somewhere unused, after all!), why not buy 
shares if good dividends are paid on them? We need to speed up 
the creation of a securities market. Then this money will 
surface. 
  The situation today is such that we simply do not have time 
to spend months developing programs and laws, and then more 
months adopting and amending them. We need to give our president 
the powers to resolve some matters through decrees. We need 
urgent measures to save our economy, first and foremost 
industry. This is where the budget revenue is formed. To a 
certain degree I am beginning to support those politicians and 
economists who maintain that the road to the market should go 
through dictatorship. Chaos is not going to get us anywhere.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zamir Shibzukhov, member of the </F>
Kabardino-Balkar Republic [KBR] Parliament Soviet of the 
Republic Commission on Legislation, Law and Order, Security and 
Human Rights, conducted by the KBR Parliament Press Center: "In 
the KBR Parliament: One Decree... Was Not Enough To Resolve the 
Issue of Limiting KBR Residence Permits"] 
  [Text] As already reported by the press, the joint 
session of the houses of the KBR Parliament will continue on 20 
April 1994. On the deputies' agenda is consideration, among 
other matter, of the issue of a temporary suspension of 
residence permit issuance in the KBR. As you are aware, this 
matter was previously discussed by the KBR Supreme Soviet, which 
by a decree issued on 30 August 1990 temporarily suspended the 
issuance of permanent residence permits in the KBR. It was in 
connection that this that the KBR Parliament is now taking up 
the issue again. This was the subject of our interview with 
Zamir Shibzukhov, a member of the KBR Parliament Soviet of the 
Republic's Commission on Legislation, Law and Order, Security 
and Human Rights. 
  [Shibzukhov] Yes, the Supreme Soviet did in fact issue its 
decree, and that decree has not yet expired, no one has repealed 
it, and it remains in effect. Furthermore, the KBR Council of 
Ministers, and later the Cabinet of Ministers, have issued a 
number of directives and decrees in compliance with that decree. 
A number of orders in connection with this also exist within the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs system, which issues residence 
permits to citizens. 
  The Supreme Soviet was forced to make the decision in 
question due to our republic's overpopulation and acute problems 
with housing, food and other social issues. The primary purpose 
of the decree was to restrict unregulated migration into the 
republic. 
  [Press Center] And have we succeeded in eliminating the 
problem? 
  [Shibzukhov] Unfortunately not. Plus new problems have 
emerged that are equally difficult. Our republic has become a 
border area of the Russian Federation, an area located in 
immediate proximity to regions of interethnic conflict. There 
has been a sharp upsurge in the crime rate, and interethnic 
problems are on the rise. 
  [Press Center] Insofar as I am aware, the influx of migrants 
is not decreasing, is it? 
  [Shibzukhov] Despite the measures taken, the influx of 
residents into our republic has only been restricted 
insignificantly. Population density in this republic is eight 
times higher than the average for Russia as a whole. According 
to statistics from the State Committee for Statistics and the 
KBR Ministry of Internal Affairs, 7,519 people took up residence 
in the republic in 1993, or 2,028 more than in 1992. Recently, 
and particularly within the past year, various individuals have 
resided here without registering by evading current statutes. 
Those individuals now number several thousand. They generally 
accomplish this by acquiring houses or apartments by various 
means. 
  [Press Center] A decree by our highest legislative body did 
not help. Why not? 
  [Shibzukhov] The main purpose of that Supreme Soviet decree 
was not accomplished. Furthermore, the lack of a clear-cut, 
well-planned and well-organized mechanism for implementation of 
the decree resulted in various abuses by local bureaucrats and 
allowed many officials to feed at the trough. As proof allow me 
to cite just one fact. According to Ministry of Internal Affairs 
information, a total of 2,194 people were illegally issued 
residence permits in our republic in 1993 alone. 
  I think that what I have said makes it quite clear why the 
Parliament has taken up this issue once again. 
  [Press Center] What is going to be done now? 
  [Shibzukhov] The commission on legislation, law and order, 
security and human rights in both houses of Parliament have been 
instructed to prepare specific proposals in regard to this 
matter. We have prepared those proposals in the form of a draft 
decree. The deputies will have the final say. The proposals 
pertain, once again, to restrictions on residence permits and 
expropriation of houses and apartments. The Parliament should 
establish clear-cut control over the mechanisms by which this 
decree is implemented. 
  I can already see your next question coming: how legal are 
these restrictions? Yes, it should be noted that some deputies 
have pointed out that the new Constitution of the Russian 
Federation, and along with it the KBR Constitution, proclaim the 
freedom to relocate and choose one's place of residence. On that 
point I would like to comment that no specific legal act 
forbidding the issuance of residence permits has ever been 
adopted. On the contrary, residence permits and restrictions on 
them exist throughout the Russian Federation. Furthermore, the 
measures we are proposing are purely temporary in nature. 
  [Press Center] Well, we can only hope that this time the 
decision made by our highest legislative body will be more 
effective.

<F P=106> [Article by K. Dzhappuyev, Kabardino-Balkar Republic State </F>
Statistical Committee chairman: "Food Product Price Increases in 
First Quarter 1994"] 
  [Text] In the first quarter of 1994 prices for goods and 
services rose by 33.4 percent, including a 30.3 percent increase 
in the price of goods, and 85.9 percent for services. For food 
products the price index was 134.3 percent, with figures of 
113.8 percent in January, 107.5 percent in February and 109.8 
percent in March. 
  During the current year there have been increases in January 
in the regulated prices of bread and beef and twice (in January 
and March) for milk, yogurt and curds. As a result of this the 
price of milk has increased by a factor of five since the 
beginning of the year, and stood at R400 [rubles] in March, as 
compared to R80 in January. The price of beef increased by a 
factor of 2.5 (R2,000 compared to R1,600 [sic]) and the price of 
bread by a factor of 1.5 (R180 per loaf compared to R120). 
During the first quarter the prices of certain food products in 
the regular retail trade network and at markets were virtually 
equal, as the cost of a one kilogram of sausage purchased from 
the retail trade network increased by 58.5 percent (R5,195 
compared to R3,278), and by 50 percent (R6,000 compared to 
R4,000) at the collective farm market. The corresponding figures 
for butter were 59.7 percent (R4,200, R2,630) and 26.7 percent 
(R3,800, R3,000), for hard cheese -- 61.4 percent (R3,550, 
R2,200) and 60.7 percent (R4,500, R2,800). 
  Due to a decline in stockpiles of vegetables in the regular 
trade network and at markets there has been a fairly significant 
increase in vegetable prices. For example, the price of one 
kilogram of cabbage increased by a factor of 1.7 in the regular 
trade network (R300, R180) and by a factor of 2.2. at kolkhoz 
markets (R1,000, R450). The corresponding price increase for 
onions was by 25.4 percent (R627, R500) and by 44.4 percent 
(R1,300, R900). 
  As a result of significant infusions of sugar, vegetable oil 
and eggs into the republic's trade network the prices of these 
items at kolkhoz markets have begun to drop. Since the beginning 
of the year the price of vegetable oil has come down by 16.7 
percent (R1,000 per kilogram, as compared to R1,200), the price 
of sugar has dropped by 14.3 percent (R600, R700), and chicken 
eggs are now 25 percent cheaper (R900 for 10 eggs, as compared 
to R1,200). 
  As of 29 March 1994 the prices of basic food products 
remained quite high in the capitals of republics, krays and 
oblasts in the Northern Caucasus, as is clear from the following 
figures (all prices are in rubles per kilogram or liter):

<F P=106> [Article by A. Khatsukov, head of the Kabardino-Balkaria </F>
Republic Radio and Television Broadcasting Center: "A Message to 
the Republic's Radio Listeners"] 
  [Text] The economic difficulties currently being 
experienced by every enterprise, both in Russia and in our 
republic, unfortunately extend to radio and television as well. 
Thus due to a lack of funds to pay for electricity, the numerous 
taxes levied by Russia and the republic and the technical upkeep 
of television and radio broadcasting equipment or to pay 
salaries to our employees, as of 1 April 1994 two radio 
broadcasting stations in the medium-frequency band which carry 
the programming of Mayak, Radio Rossiya and local 
Kabardino-Balkaria Radio programming will go off the air. 
  It is not by choice that we are shutting down these two 
energy-intensive radio transmitters, but rather for the purpose 
of maintaining broadcasts of television programs within the 
territory of our republic and maintaining broadcasts of the 
aforementioned radio programming in the ultra-shortwave band, 
since during the first quarter of 1994 the Republic Radio and 
Television Broadcasting Center received only about 10 percent of 
the requisite funding via television and radio companies from 
the Russian budget, which is its sole source of funding. 
  Nor is the Russian Government currently promising to resolve 
the matter of funding for the radio broadcasting companies that 
carry television and radio broadcasts throughout all of Russia, 
including our republic. 
  In consideration of the fact that many radio listeners do 
not 
own receivers capable of receiving the ultra-shortwave band, 
temporarily, until such time as the current economic 
difficulties stabilize, broadcasting of Kabardino-Balkaria Radio 
programming will continue in the medium-frequency band, with one 
station operating at a lower power level. Therefore reception of 
the programming in question will be possible in the city of 
Nalchik and in nearby towns if an external antenna is used. 
  For high-quality reception of central and local radio 
broadcasts listeners must have a radio receiver that operates in 
the ultra-shortwave band. These are available in stores. 
  We will be emphasizing this band as we develop our radio 
broadcasting efforts. Toward that end, despite economic 
difficulties the staff members of the republic radio and 
television broadcasting center are themselves presently 
installing a new four-channel Dozhd-4 radio transmitter that 
will operate in the ultra-shortwave band. This transmitted will 
be located in Nalchik and will replace a Dozhd-2 transmitter. 
  When this four-channel transmitter goes on air on 1 July 
1994, full central programming will be available over three 
channels: Channel One, Mayak and Radio Rossiya. The fourth 
channel will be reserved for our own republic programming. This 
will be the first time since its establishment that 
Kabardino-Balkaria Radio will have its own independent channel. 
  At the present time the creative staff of Kabardino-Balkaria 
Television and Radio Broadcasting are looking for ways to 
increase their own air time.

<F P=106> [Kabardino-Balkar Republic [KBR] Cabinet of Ministers Decree </F>
No. 37, issued 3 March 1994: "On Efforts by the Nalchik City 
Administration To Maintain Public Order and Combat Crime, With 
Consideration for the Requirements of a KBSSR Presidential Edict 
Issued on 16 January 1992, `On Urgent Measures To Improve Law 
and Order in the KBSSR'"] 
  [Text] The KBR Cabinet of Ministers notes that issues 
pertaining to maintenance of public order and anti-crime efforts 
account for a significant share of the work done by the Nalchik 
City Administration. It is making efforts to ensure compliance 
with laws and create the proper conditions for the functioning 
of law enforcement agencies, including public safety militia 
units (local militia). A number of measures of an 
organizational, financial and physical support nature have been 
implemented for the purpose of supporting law enforcement 
agencies, in particular militia units. 
  However, despite the measures that have been taken the crime 
situation in the republic capital remains difficult, with the 
number of serious crimes increasing by 19.4 percent and the 
number of crimes committed by minors up by 56 percent. The 
overall apprehension rate is 45.3 percent, below the 
republic-wide figure. There is no clear-cut interaction between 
various internal affairs departments. Crime prevention efforts 
are poorly organized, including efforts to prevent recidivism. 
  Economic crime is occurring on a large scale. Proper 
interaction between internal affairs agencies, the tax service 
and the Tax Police Department has not been developed in 
connection with efforts to combat this type of crime. Serious 
shortcomings have been noted in the operations of the city 
court, and procuratorial oversight is not sufficiently effective. 
  Physical and technical support for law enforcement agencies 
is not up to modern standards. There continues to be a shortage 
of vehicles, telephone and radio communications equipment and 
many other types of special equipment. The 2nd Internal Affairs 
Department lacks office space, the city court is housed in two 
buildings, and the city procuracy lacks normal working 
conditions. The problem of how to provide housing for members of 
law enforcement agencies is acute. 
  Thus far the city administration has not made full use of 
the 
powers granted it to maintain law and order and monitor the 
operations of internal affairs agencies. A plan for priority 
anti-crime measures in the KBR in 1993 that was approved by a 
Republic Supreme Soviet decree on 27 April 1993 has not yet been 
fully implemented. 
  The KBR Cabinet of Ministers hereby resolves: 
  1. to note that measures taken by the Nalchik City 
Administration to protect public order and combat crime in the 
republic's capital are inadequate. 
  2. in view of the difficult crime situation in the city of 
Nalchik, to instruct the Nalchik City Administration to draw up 
during the second quarter of 1994, in conjunction with the KBR 
Ministry of Internal Affairs and other law enforcement agencies, 
priority measures to improve protection of public order in the 
city and to prevent and investigate serious crimes. 
  3. that the Nalchik City Administration (S. B. Abrokov) 
shall: 
  -- increase its demands on the heads of city internal 
affairs 
departments and personally oversee their efforts to combat 
violations of the law; 
  -- take effective measures to reverse the decline in public 
activism with regard to preservation of public order, and by 1 
July 1994 arrange for the establishment of volunteer citizens' 
patrols through major labor collectives, providing them with 
material incentives and reestablishing public law enforcement 
posts; 
  -- focus greater attention on improving the working and 
living conditions of persons employed by law enforcement 
agencies and judges, providing them with office space and 
housing in a timely manner; during the first half of 1994 make 
private garden plots, parcels of land for individual 
construction and loans for those purposes available to the 
aforementioned personnel; by the end of 1994 fully provide 
members of the militia, the procuracy and judges with telephones 
in their offices and homes; complete by 1 April 1994 the 
renovation of office space set aside for the 3rd Internal 
Affairs Department; by the end of 1994 solve the problem of 
locating appropriate office space for the City Procuracy; 
  -- in conjunction with the KBR Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
during the first half of 1994 consider and take action on the 
possibility and appropriateness of establishing a coordinating 
center for the purpose of arranging interaction between internal 
affairs departments and other law enforcement agencies in their 
efforts to combat crime and establish proper order in the city 
of Nalchik; 
  -- in order to improve protection of all forms of property, 
in conjunction with the KBR Ministry of Internal Affairs and 
other affected agencies study the appropriateness and 
possibility of restricting and eventually banning entry into the 
city by motor vehicles from other regions of the Russian 
Federation, submitting proposals to this effect to the KBR 
Cabinet of Ministers during the fourth quarter of 1994. 
  4. to direct the attention of KBR minister of internal 
affairs Kh. A. Shogenov to serious shortcomings in the 
operations of internal affairs departments in the city of 
Nalchik with regard to the investigation and prevention of 
crimes, and to demand that effective measures be taken to 
improve the effectiveness of those departments' efforts to 
strengthen law and order. 
  5. that the KBR minister of internal affairs (Kh. A. 
Shogenov) shall in conjunction with the city administration 
consider and take action on the following matters in 1994: 
  -- additional allocation of motor vehicles, fuels and 
lubricants for the needs of city internal affairs departments, 
primarily dispatcher stations and patrol and checkpoint units; 
  -- full supply of radio communications equipment, recording 
equipment, photographic supplies, copying machines, video 
equipment and other types of special equipment to criminal 
militia under the city's internal affairs departments; 
  -- relocation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Financial 
and Economic Department, the Address Bureau and the Okhrana 
[Protection] Association Warehouse (a part of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs) out of the 2nd Internal Affairs Department's 
building in order to ensure normal working conditions for the 
department's personnel; 
  -- the possibility and appropriateness of setting up militia 
units in the Volnyy Aul and KBGU microrayons and a militia 
station in the park zone, with allocation of the necessary 
buildings; 
  -- improvement of the effectiveness of the medical 
detoxification unit to ensure profitability in its operations. 
  6. to propose that the KBR Procuracy (R. I. Abazov) take 
measures to improve the effectiveness of procuratorial oversight 
in the city of Nalchik with regard to exact compliance with laws 
pertaining to the protection of citizens' rights and legitimate 
interests, crime prevention and investigation, and compliance 
with the law in the operations of internal affairs agencies, the 
city court and the executive branch. 
  7. that the Ministry of Justice (A. M. Batyrbekov) shall 
take 
measures to increase the effectiveness with which the city 
court's operations are organized and ensure correct application 
of legislation in judicial practice. 
  8. that the Administrative Law Department of the KBR Cabinet 
of Ministers Administration of Affairs shall monitor compliance 
with this decree. 
  9. that the status of compliance with this decree by the 
Nalchik City Administration and the KBR Ministry of Internal 
Affairs shall be reported to the KBR Cabinet of Ministers by 1 
February 1995 based on year-end findings.

<F P=106> [Interview with Col Militia Ruslan Shkhamgeriyevich </F>
Yeshugaov, chief of the Administration for Organized Crime in 
the North Caucasus, by Z. Malbakhova: "Crime Is a Shadow of 
Society"; place and date not specified] 
  [Text] A few years ago, when organized crime was 
discussed at the state level, many, including specialists from 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs, believed that the creation of 
special subdivisions for the struggle with it is has no 
prospects, basing their argument on individual facts of the 
appearance of gangsterism, the corruption of the state 
administrative structures, etc. 
  The transition to the new social order proved to be 
protracted. And this is what had to happen in a country that had 
started, towards changes, clearly understanding only one 
thing--from what it is running away, but having only a vague 
notion of where the road will lead on which it has embarked, and 
what pits, turns, and holes it will encounter on this road. 
  The criminals of all colors and categories could not 
but profit from this, and the apprehensions about the lack of 
prospects for the creation of the country's Ministry of Internal 
Affairs new structural subdivisions for the struggle against 
organized crime, unfortunately, turned out to lack foundation. 
On the contrary, their appearance was somewhat late. 
  Today I am talking with the chief of the Administration 
for Organized Crime in the North Caucasus Col. Militia Ruslan 
Shkhamgeriyevich Yeshugaov. He is heading the only subdivision 
of this kind in Russia that is not subordinated to the 
territorial organs of internal affairs but is an independent 
structual organ of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs and 
carries out the full scope of work in regard to the exposure and 
unmasking of corrupt persons and organized criminal formations 
that have inter-oblast, inter-republic, and inter-state links. 
  Given the complication of the operational situation in 
the region, this subdivision must provide qualified assistance 
to the territorial organs of international affairs and monitor 
the implementation of federal laws pertaining to the struggle 
against organized crime and corruption by the local organs of 
internal affairs. 
  [Malbakhova] Ruslan Shkhamgeriyevich, today, as never 
before, 
a great deal depends on the personality of the leader of any 
level. We would like to find out in detail about your career 
path, about who you were prior to your appointment to this post? 
  [Yeshugaov] Since birth I have lived and worked in 
Kabardino-Balkaria. My first post was inspector of the nursery 
of the militia at the Nalchik Railway Station. Upon graduation 
from the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs, I was appointed 
deputy chief for criminal investigation of the republic and then 
took part in the formation and creation of the new Sixth 
Department for the Struggle Against Organized Crime of the 
Kabardino-Balkar Republic Ministry of Internal Affairs. While in 
this post, I was invited to work in the USSR Ministry of 
Internal Affairs as deputy chief of the Inter-regional 
Department for Struggle Against Drug Traffic in the territory of 
the North Caucasus. During this time there took place a training 
period in the FRG in line with the new appointment. After the 
breaking up of the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs I was 
invited to create this subdivision in the territory of the North 
Caucasus, which is what I worked on. 
  [Malbakhova] How justified is the presence of an independent 
subdivision for organized crime of the RF Ministry of Internal 
Affairs when such departments exist in the territorial organs of 
internal affairs? 
  [Yeshugaov] The criminal world has changed. It has expanded 
its influence not only on the social but also on the geographic 
plane. If state relations have weakened, criminal ones, on the 
contrary, acquire an increasingly stable character. 
  The creation of such a subdivision had many reasons, 
including the unabating Osetino-Ingush, the Abkhaz-Georgian, and 
the Armenian-Azerbaijan armed conflicts, and the confrontational 
policy of Chechnia in relation to Russia. 
  The North Caucasus has become a convenient place for the 
acquisition and sale of weapons, the hi-jacking and sale of 
means of transport and many other no less serious manifestations 
of the criminal milieu. 
  The crimes themselves, as a rule, have ceased to have a 
local 
character. They can begin in one republic, develop in another, 
and be realized in a third. Our tasks include the coordination 
of the activity and the extension of practical assistance to all 
territorial organs for organized crime in the North Caucasus. 
  Quite recently, for example, an operation was completed to 
arrest criminals during the delivery of fire arms destined for 
sale, in which, together with us, staff members of the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs of Kabardino-Balkaria and Stavropol Kray 
took part. Forty-nine automatic weapons were confiscated. 
Jointly with the UOP [Office for Combating Organized Crime] of 
the Kabardino-Balkar Republic, we are conducting an 
investigation into a case concerning the sale of a large batch 
of drugs, more than a thousand ampoules, stolen, according our 
information, from pharmaceutical institutions. 
  A group of criminals was arrested, inhabitants of 
Kabardino-Balkaria and Chechnia, from whom 26 million in 
counterfeit money were confiscated. The success of this 
operation was also attained through joint efforts. Our 
administration is handling more than 30 operational 
investigations, including a certain part dealing with the 
Kabardino-Balkar Republic. 
  [[Malbakhova] They say that in the employment of staff 
members in your subdivision preference is given to those who are 
not residents of the republic. 
  [Yeshugaov] In the formation of staffs we proceed only from 
the professional suitability of the candidates and we put the 
moral qualities of people in first place. Representatives of 13 
nationalities are working in our administration, and among them 
also Kabards and Balkars. Many of our staff members are former 
paratroopers, masters of sports, military officers who have 
lived through Afghanistan, have the title of Honored Workers of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs, decorated with the orders and 
medals "For Bravery" and "For Personal Courage." 
  [Malbakhova] How does your subdivision differ from similar 
territorial ones? 
  [Yeshugaov] First of all, we are better equipped 
technically. 
We have more powerful means of transportation; if necessary, 
even helicopters are put at our disposal, since the entire North 
Caucasus region is our zone of operation. Appeals for our 
assistance come from Perm, Kursk, Ryazan, and Magadan in order, 
in cooperation with the Chechen organs of internal affairs, to 
solve the tasks of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the 
Ministry of Security of the Russian Federation. 
  [Malbakhov] Why do you single out the Chechen Republic? 
  [Yeshugaov] Because it singled itself out. Proceeding from 
the reports of the press and radio about the Chechen mafia and 
the frequently hypertrophied rumors about disorders in the 
republic, internal affairs staff members from the Russian 
regions do not go there, fearing refusal of assistance by 
representatives of the law enforcement services of Ichkeria. We 
are successful in getting this cooperation; for example, our 
people took part in the liberation of two hostages from Moscow, 
who were held in the territory of the republic for over 2 months. 
  Secondly, we have subdivisions that the territorial 
administrations do not have. For example, a department for the 
introduction of new forms of operational and intelligence 
activity. 
  [Malbakhova] What does this department do? 
  [Yeshugaov] It develops and introduces new methods of work 
in 
the criminal sphere. 
  [Malbakhova] What is the result of your work after a year of 
existence, and what are you engaged in at the present time? 
  [Yeshugaov] As the result of the operations that have been 
conducted valuables worth R4.5 billion have been confiscated 
from criminals, several thousand units of ammunition, two rocket 
launchers, 142 kilograms of explosives in the Kabardino-Balkar 
Republic. It is necessary to work in the zone of the 
Ossetian-Ingush conflict together with the operational and 
investigation group and the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs for 
the ascertainment, investigation and release of hostages. 
  We take part in the investigation of crimes that have been 
perpetrated by members of revolutionary groups. For example, 
[the investigation] regarding the exposure of the murder of V. 
Polyanichko--the former head of the provisional administration. 
  [Malbakhova] Can one call it a political crime? 
  [Yeshugaov] The work has not yet been completed, but all of 
its participants are known. The only thing remaining is their 
arrest. 
  [Malbakhova] Incidentally, why do the representatives of the 
law enforcement organs in their numerous press conferences 
regarding the exposure of various sorts of crimes utilize such 
answers: "The situation is under control." "We know the names of 
all the participants," and so on. Journalists perceive such 
statements as subterfuges, an escape from direct answers. 
  [Yeshugaov] I disagree in principle with such assertions. To 
our great regret, according to data of the analytical center of 
the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs, only one-third of the 
organized crime groups are known. . . 
  [Malbakhova] Could you not tell us about the most serious 
cases on which you are now working? 
  [Yeshugaov] We are investigating the theft of large monetary 
assets carried out through the forgery of bank documents, and 
the creation of fake enterprises in the territory of Dagestan. 
Ninety investigators and as many operational workers are taking 
part in it. From this you can conclude what the "dimension" of 
crime is. 
  Recently, according to our operational materials, we 
instituted criminal proceedings, in accordance with which about 
100 motor vehicles are being confiscated that were stolen, among 
400 others, from the Nizhni Novgorod Automobile Plant. . . . 
  [Malbakhova] Have you in your practice encountered cases 
with 
mafia manifestations? 
  [Yeshugaov] The case of the theft of 400 motor vehicles, 
which I mention, is in the stage of investigation and a great 
deal remains to be illuminated. But already now, as soon as we 
started to confiscate transportation, the deputy plant director 
for marketing, has shot himself. For the time being, we do not 
yet have reason to believe that the suicide took place because 
of the involvement of the director of the enterprise in this 
crime. But the very fact points to corresponding changes of the 
investigation. 
  [Malbakhova] What are the basic characteristics of the 
manifestations of organized crime in the region? 
  [Yeshugaov] First of all, the high degree to which criminals 
and the population in general are armed. Every third serious 
crime is committed with the use of fire arms or in their 
presence. Secondly, gangsterism in pure form. Somewhere in the 
region there is less, for example, in Karachayevo-Cherkessia and 
the Kabardino-Balkar Republic, and somewhere there is more--in 
Dagestan. 
  Attack on motor transport, cargo theft, the murder of 
drivers. Thirdly, all conceivable machinations with 
securities--counterfeit, forgery of bank documents. These trends 
are not subsiding. 
  [Malbakhova] What can you say about the two murders in 
Nalchik: In the barbershop and the "Audi-500" motor vehicle? 
According to rumors, this was a quarrel of two gangs. 
  [Yeshugaov] We have not worked on this case. 
  [Malbakhova] Why? Is this not a manifestation of organized 
crime? 
  [Yeshugaov] In terms of our functional obligations, we work 
on inter-republic and inter-state cases of organized crime. 
Although I can say that not a single serious case remains 
outside of our purview. The presence of quarrels characterizes 
the level of organized crime. But in the territory of 
Kabardino-Balkaria their intensiveness is not great. Close by, 
in Mineralnyye Vody, we have many more of them, but in Dagestan 
up to 160 terrorist acts with explosions and similar affairs. 
Moreover, whole groups of criminals take part in the quarrels, 
in this case one can suppose the settling of accounts of two 
enemies. 
  [Malbakhova] What, in your view, are the reasons for the 
growth in crime? 
  [Yeshugaov] This is the seamy side of the political, social, 
and economic processes that are taking place in society. The 
militia can influence some one trend, but to put a stop to this 
growth as a whole is beyond its strength. 
  Beginning in 1982, the law enforcement organs have been in 
constant change. Because of low salaries, 600,000 high-class 
specialists in their time left the internal affairs organs. It 
was at that time, in my view, that the inadmissible 
rapprochement of the poles of the criminal world and the law 
enforcement services took place. In many respects this is 
connected with the material aspect. 
  According to the data of our Main Administration, 500 cases 
have been recorded where action was brought against staff 
members of the militia who had become members of criminal 
groups. In our Administration, there is a special subdivision 
that monitors our own staff members. A similar structural unit 
exists in many special services in the world. And I think that 
in the present conditions it is necessary. 
  To the reasons for the growth in crime one can add the 
factor 
of impunity. At a recent conference in the Main Administration 
it was stated that there are 120 cases, where gangsters were 
released from custody by the unjustified decision of courts. And 
this means that their subsequent decisions will still be more 
audacious and impudent. One cannot but single out the inertness 
of society itself. If all citizens of the country cease [as 
published] to be so passive and individual means of reaction to 
criminal manifestations remain, indifference to the fate of 
others and fear for their own will remain high. 
  The reports of the law enforcement organs on the criminal 
situation in the country at times remind one of fragments of 
"hard-boiled" Western police films. We have already become quite 
accustomed to all the horrors being created by criminals which 
are talked about on TV screens and simply in the people. Because 
of this there is a special demand of the law enforcent organs, 
for they are the guardians of the law. But, apparently, it is 
worth thinking about the fact that all the claims which society 
is making on the militia service must also be addressed to 
society itself as a whole, which is suffering from a shortage of 
spirituality, morality, purity of thoughts, and hence just 
causes as well.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The City Budget for 1993"] </F>
  [Text] Starting with today's issue we will be 
publishing materials from the 28th session of the city soviet of 
people's deputies. 
  We offer for your attention the statement of the 
revenues and expenditures of Kazan in 1993 submitted by the 
chief of the city financial administration V. Titov and the 
resolution "On Local Taxes and Fees." 
  Kazan began 1993 without an approved budget, but specialists 
of finance and tax organs and leaders of the city and rayons 
were working under calmer circumstances. Having had the 
stressful experience of 1992, the city accumulated a small 
reserve of financial resources in the amount of 2.2 billion 
rubles [R]. 
  The first to be financed were immediate expenditures on 
wages, grants, stipends, medications, and food, compensations 
for children, and costs of acquiring equipment. [Line(s) 
missing] financing of repair and capital construction. 
  But again it was necessary to make a request to the republic 
finance minister, D. Nagumanov, to allot the city an 
interest-free budget loan, which would make it possible to solve 
many problems in city management and the sociocultural sphere 
and to grant financial aid to rayons and enterprises that had 
found themselves in an extremely difficult financial position. 
  Only on 28 April 1993 did the deputies of the city soviet 
approve the city budget and take under advisement the 
consolidated budget of Kazan for revenues; for expenditures--R54 
billion, with a deficit of R7 billion or 18 percent [line(s) 
missing]. 
  The rayon leaders were urged to look for new revenues and to 
utilize budget funds economically. There was a concrete plan of 
extraordinary measures for the period from May through December 
1993 for each city service and for each rayon. Thus revenues 
amounting to R246 billion were mobilized. 
  The main sources of revenue for the city budget in 1993 
were: 
  --profit tax--R94.2 billion; 
  --income tax on individuals--R29.2 billion; 
  --property tax--R3.6 billion; 
  --land fees--R1.7 billion 
  --revenues from privatization--R46.5 million; 
  --water fees--R59 million, and other receipts. 
  With the help of local taxes and fees approved by the city 
and rayon soviets of people's deputies an additional R2.6 
billion was mobilized for the budget. Moreover additional income 
was collected in keeping with decisions of administrative 
commissions in the amount of R222 million, fees collected for 
automotive inspection--50 [lines missing]...books--R387 million, 
and the sums received from raising prices above the maximum 
level of profitability--R365 million. Other reserves were 
utilized as well, for example, tax on profit of enterprises with 
foreign capital amounted to a total of R14 million, the tax on 
profit from intermediary operations--R25 million, the tax on 
operations with securities--R108 million, and fees for 
transactions conducted on commodity markets--R5 million. So the 
developing market structures are capable of providing the city's 
treasury with considerable funds in the future. 
  Because the growth rates of expenditures considerably 
outstripped the growth rates of revenues, the financing of the 
local economy and the sociocultural sphere was extremely 
strained. Practically all of the overfulfillment of the revenue 
part of the city budget was used to cover costs related to 
indexation of material expenditures and the wage increase. More 
than R15 billion was spent just on raising wages of workers of 
the sociocultural sphere. 
  On the whole, expenditures from the city budget amounted to 
R169 billion: 
  R81 billion was spent on the economy; 
  R69 billion--on sociocultural measures; 
  R44 billion--on the development of housing and municipal 
services enterprises; 
  R35 billion--on capital investments in various branches; 
  R16 billion on capital repair of roads and maintenance. 
  R3 billion was spent on capital repair of residential 
buildings and yard areas, which made it possible to repair 
70,500 square meters of apartments and restore the facades on 
327 buildings. R534 million was spent on routine maintenance of 
cemeteries. 
  An amount of R19 billion was allotted to make up for the 
declining revenues of housing and municipal service enterprises 
and organizations. Allotted from the budget for housing 
operations organizations was R8 billion just to cover planned 
losses caused by the sharp increase in the cost of materials and 
heat and electric energy. 
  In 1993 there was a significant increase in the proportion 
of 
financing of city electric transportation with city budget funds 
since the actual revenues of the transportation workers 
compensated for only 3.3 percent of the costs of transporting 
passengers. Thus the average cost of transporting one passenger 
on city electric transportation was R65, of which R58 or 89.2 
percent was paid from the city budget. On the acquisition of 17 
streetcars [line(s) missing]... cultural institutions in 1993, 
R56.2 billion or 33.2 percent was allotted from the state 
budget. Some R25.5 billion was spent on public health. Costs of 
food and medications came close to R5 billion. The same amount 
was spent on capital repair of treatment institutions. 
  An amount of R13 billion was allotted for the development of 
cultural institutions. With these funds they managed to finance 
24 children's music and art schools, 66 libraries, a zoo, and 
the Central Park of Culture and Recreation. More than R190 
million was spent on partial reimbursement for costs of editing 
the city's newspapers SHAKHRI KAZAN and KAZANSKIYE VEDOMOSTI; 
and on the creation of city programs of the Efir television 
company and the Radio and Passazh organizations--more than R37 
million. 
  A total of R28 billion was spent on the development of 
public 
education, of which R10 billion went for wages. Last year about 
R7 billion was spent on repair of schools and other educational 
facilities; on the acquisition of computers--R125 million, and 
on the repair of school dining rooms and the purchase of 
equipment for them--R600 million. In 1993 local soviets included 
on the balance sheet 51 children's departmental preschool 
institutions, whose maintenance took R990 million. 
  Some R136 million was allotted for mass sports measures and 
capital repair of the Central Stadium imeni Lenin; R17 million 
was allotted for maintaining 12 movie theaters that were 
transferred to city ownership. 
  The reinforcement of the material and technical base of the 
municipal militia and the maintenance of its subdivisions cost 
the budget R1.5 billion. 
  Expenditures on maintaining organizations of representative 
and executive powers of Kazan amounted [line(s) missing] ... 
required collecting budget funds in a volume of R50 billion, 
including for housing construction--R18 billion, municipal 
construction--R16 billion, construction for public education--R4 
billion, and public health--R9 billion. Some R2.6 billion was 
spent on compensation for the rising cost of construction of 
housing construction cooperatives, and R400 million on the draft 
of the General Plan for the Development of Kazan.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Khuzin: "On the Theatre of Party Activities"] </F>
  [Text] Our newspaper sometimes reports on the 
political forces of the oblast. What kind of forces are these, 
and what specifically do they do, for example in the electoral 
campaigns? --V. SHARKOV, Sysertskiy Rayon. 
<H8>  The time of inception </H8>
  The first and last elections of USSR people's deputies in 
1989 led to a bipolarization of our civil society. For 
Sverdlovsk Oblast specifically this meant a conditioal division 
of its residents into the "party of the Month" and the "party of 
Kudrin." The personified "multiparty system" was one of the 
stages of its birth. The groups supporting the candidates for 
deputy became that germ of future parties whose inception 
occurred specifically during the time of introduction of 
alternative choice into the country's political system. Not even 
9 months had passed after the elections to the union parliament, 
and the first child was born in the Central Urals--the 
"Democratic Choice Movement" (DCM). 
  The next elections, to the Russian parliament, also took 
place under conditions of bipolarity of civil society, but it 
was already of a higher level. There was a transition from the 
personified "bipartisanism" to an organized one--the CPSU 
[Communist Party of the Soviet Union] and the DCM competed 
against each other. And so, finally, the elections in December 
of 1993 demonstrated the polycentric party system. For the first 
time in many years, we saw voting according to party lists. 
  In Russia, as we know, they are slow to hitch up the horses, 
but then they ride rather fast. And so it was in the question of 
a multiparty system, the country will evidently soon find itself 
"at the head of the entire planet." According to the lists of 
the RF Minyust [Russian Federation Ministry of Justice], over 
120 organizations had the opportunity of participating in the 
December elections. Over 50 of them decided to exercise this 
opportunity, but only 35 engaged in gathering of voter 
signatures needed for participation in the elections under the 
proportional system. Twenty-one organizations gathered the 
required number of signatures. However, our very rich traditions 
of "holding and not letting in" allowed only 13 electoral 
associations to enter the final stretch. Moreover, "quite by 
accident" it happened that one of the primary political 
associations--the National Patriotic Association--"left" the 
arena of struggle. This, specifically, may explain the 
phenomenon of the Liberal-Democratic Party, which received the 
greatest number of votes. 
  The process of mutual development of political pluralism and 
the electoral system for the present day is still far from its 
conclusion. This is true of the multi-party system, where the 
increase in numbers no longer facilitates the development of 
quality. This is true also of the system of elections, where we 
have noted shameless administrative intervention in the process 
of certain subjects of the electoral campaign. If we take 
specifically Sverdlovsk Oblast, we see the immaturity of the 
system of elections to the oblast Duma and the organs of local 
self-government prior to elections under the proportional 
system, or according to party lists. 
<H8>  `Bumps and bruises' from past elections </H8>
  The December elections to the RF [Russian Federation] 
Federal 
Assembly are still fresh in our minds. Undoubtedly, their 
dominant factor was the activity, agitational and 
organizational, of the parties, movements and blocks, which 
facilitated the continued re-structuring of civil society. 
However, it is not difficult to note their main 
peculiarity--weak social roots, a strong cadre-oriented 
character, and a non-systematic method of work. 
  Even before the elections, it was quite obvious that the 
upcoming campaign would lead to changes in the power ratio 
between the center and the regions, in favor of the former. The 
elections by party lists gave an undisputed priority to the 
candidates from Moscow and St. Petersburg. Even the introduction 
of the standard on the right to break down the party list of 
candidates for deputy into regional groups did not help. Plus, 
by some inscrutable administrative means, the electoral 
districts in the center turned out to be smaller in their number 
of voters than those in the provincial regions. And this meant 
that there were relatively more of them. Why should we now be 
surprised when around 62 percent of the deputies in the State 
Duma are from Moscow? 
  Another rather new situation for us is the change in the 
relationship between the role of the individual and the 
organization. The introduction of party lists made it possible 
for individual candidates to seemingly hide behind the curtain 
of the party or the leader of their block, as a result of which 
there has been a depersonification of the candidate corps. Many 
of those who "did not get the light" of mandate got into the 
Duma. 
  The next peculiarity which we cannot discount is the fact 
that the "apical nature" of parties conditions the formulation 
of a certain eliteness of the elections. A sort of closed system 
(group of persons) is formed, which by the method of a periodic 
"shuffling of the cards" holds in its hands the authority of 
power. To this one might object: What is so bad about that? 
After all, the formation of a stable elite in society 
facilitates its stable development. Furthermore, politics is not 
a matter for housewives. However, there is another side to this 
coin: Our elite, as a rule, is far from being uniform, and 
periodic "bulldog fights under the rug" cannot facilitate the 
development of true democracy, i.e., people's power. 
  12 December for Sverdlovsk Oblast, as, we might add, also 
for 
many other oblasts, became a notable day: For the first time, 
the majority of voters did not come to the electoral districts. 
Thus, one of the most widespread, age-old and chronic illnesses 
of traditional democracies--absenteeism (the refusal to vote in 
the elections) came also to our parts. It is interesting that 
preliminary polls conducted by the Committee on Relations with 
Public Associations under the oblast govenment showed that 42-54 
percent of the voters intended to participate in the voting. 
There were some hopes placed on the "undecided" voters, 
particularly since no more than one-fourth of those surveyed 
categorically refused to vote. Nevertheless, the result was 
somewhat surprising--51 percent of the voters on the average 
throughout the oblast refused to vote. 
  We may cite many reasons why this happened, and far from the 
last one of these is the factor of great polyvariation of the 
political choice. Many with whom we had occasion to speak since 
12 December said just that: There were so many parties and 
candidates that it was impossible to sort them out, and 
therefore there was no sense in voting. 
  Our sociological surveys came to the same conclusion. In 
mid-November, only one in ten respondents considered himself 
informed on the platforms of the parties and candidates. 
Approximately four out of five persons surveyed in different 
parts of the Central Urals noted that they did not know about 
the draft constitution, the statute on elections and the 
programs of those hoping to be elected to the Federal Assembly. 
<H8>  So what is the choice? </H8>
  According to the all-federal party lists, there were 37 
people nominated from Sverdlovsk Oblast. Among them: From 
"Choice of Russia"--10; from the Democratic Party (Travkin)--5; 
from the "Future of Russia--New Names" block--5; from the 
Movement for Democratic Reform (Sobchak)--3; from PRES [Party 
for Russian Unity and Accord] (Shakhray)--3; from "KEDR"--3; two 
each from the LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia], the 
Agrarian Party and the "Civic Union", and one each from the 
Russian Communist Party and "Yabloko." Thus, out of 13 blocks 
our oblast countrymen were represented in 11 of them. 
  Altogether by territorial okrugs in the oblast there were 34 
candidates presented. Of those, three were from the 
double-mandate district to the Federation Council, 22 were from 
blocks and parties, and 12 were from the groups of electors to 
the State Duma. 
  And so, what choice did we make? 
  Most apparent is the rather small percentage of those who 
voted against all the electoral blocks--only 3. We may assume 
that the main mass of those who did not come to the polls was 
also "against everyone." 
  The political breakdown of forces among the oblast's voters 
may easily be expressed in a table, grouping together all the 
electoral blocks and groups: The pro-presidential ("Choice of 
Russia," Yabloko, PRES and RDDR [Russian Movement for Democratic 
Reform); the centrist ("Future of Russia--New Names," "Civic 
Union," the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia], "Dignity and 
Charity," "KEDR," and "Women of Russia") and the opposition 
(CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], APR [Agrarian 
Party of Russia], LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia]). 
The results of the voting by percentage of voters were as 
follows: 


District           Pro-presidential     Centrist     Opposition     Against 
                                                                    all 
                                                                    blocks 

Artemovskiy        32                   13           37             5 

Verkh-Isetskiy     57                   14           17             5 

Kamensk-Ural       44                   19           23             5 

Nizhnetagil        47                   17           22             5 

Ordzhonikidze      58                   14           17             4 

Pervouralsk        40                   18           28             5 

Serovskiy          45                   19           24             6 

All                46                   17           24             -- 


  As we see from the figures presented above, the fellow 
countrymen of the first RF [Russian Federation] President on the 
whole retain their ties. The elections to the Federal Assembly 
also showed an exceptional weakness and erosion of the political 
center and a considerable polarization of society. Evidently, 
the times of the centrists have not yet come, and the logic of 
the "revolutionary" situation and civic opposition remains in 
force. The weakness of the center is explained by its 
fragmentation, by the high degree of differentiation of these 
forces, by the absence of a unifying organizational principle 
and an outstanding individual capable of organizing the center. 
  Unlike the blocks of general political forces, the elections 
showed the weakness of the functional blocks which are oriented 
toward a certain social group or social problem. The only 
exception to this was the "Women of Russia," which won 8 percent 
of the votes. 
  Such a peculiarity of the elections as lack of 
correspondence 
of political affiliations of many voters in voting on different 
bulletins also did not escape the eye of the specialists. For 
example, in the Artemovskiy Electoral District, where the 
candidates for the State Duma represented the most varied 
political forces, by party lists the LDPR was victorious, by the 
single-mandate district--the candidate from the Agrarian Party, 
and the majority upheld the presidential draft constitution. And 
the same voters were voting on all of these. 
<H8>  The main characters </H8>
  There are already over 700 public associations registered 
with the oblast justice administration. The most numerous group 
of these is represented by various funds--around 15 percent. 
Sports and cultural organizations comprise approximately the 
same amount. 
  Twelve percent of those registered are youth organizations, 
the largest of which is the oblast organization of the Russian 
Union of Youth, the Association of Student Youth, the section of 
the Russian Union of Young Entrepreneurs, and the Association of 
Youth Organizations. 
  A large relative share is comprised of organizations of 
former military servicemen and veteran's organizations (around 8 
percent), invalids (around 5 percent), and women (around 2 
percent). Of the ecological organizations (around 4 percent), 
most are territorial sections of the "Chernobyl" Union. 
  The dominant role among professional organizations belongs 
to 
the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Sverdlovsk Oblast, 
aside from which there are the Independent Trade Union of 
Miners, the Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the 
Partnership of Trade Unions of the city of Yekaterinburg. 
  The Sverdlovsk Oblast Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs was the most influential among entrepreneurial 
organizations. 
  Cossack associations comprise the registered Cossack 
stanitsas [villages], which are affiliated with two primary 
organizations: The Yekaterinburg section of the Orenburg Cossack 
Troops [OCT] and the Isetskiy section of the OCT. 
  There are around 50 organizations registered with the oblast 
justice administration which have a clearly expressed political 
character. These comprise over 6 percent of the overall number. 
One in every three has all-Russian status, one in six has oblast 
status, and every other one has city or rayon status. One in six 
speaks out as a political party, and one in four--as a rights 
protection organization. 
  The absolute figures are not presented here for one 
reason--their make-up is constantly changing: Some "fade into 
history," others register again, and still others re-register 
under new names. 
  By the beginning of March the oblast electoral commission 
had 
registered 29 public associations which wanted to take part in 
the elections. These may be divided into specifically political 
(party and non-party) and functional (corporative) groups. 
  The political group is made up of about 12 organizations 
which are usually called "democrats," 4 centrist organizations 
("Transformation of the Urals," "Ural Center," DPR, and RSM 
[Russian Union of Youth], and finally, 7 opposition 
organizations--of communist, socialist and national-patriotic 
directionality. 
  The second group is comprised of associations which have a 
clear function of reflecting the interests of a specific 
category. The "Russian Fund for Charity and Health," the "Beer 
Lovers Society", etc. may also conditionally be classed in this 
group. 
  Many socio-political associations have for a comparatively 
long time been preparing for the struggle for seats in the 
oblast Duma and the organs of local self-government. The 
temporary statutes on elections which were ratified by the head 
of administration clearly did not suit them by the very 
procedure by which they are held as well as by the number of 
seats in the representative bodies and the functions of these 
bodies. 
  The definite dissatisfaction with the rules of the 
pre-electoral struggle nevertheless did not decrease the number 
of those wishing to participate in them. The change in 
principles, according to which the elections will be conducted 
on 10 April, defined a certain re-grouping of the political 
forces. One of the main determining factors will evidently 
become the multi-mandate districts. 
  The political blocks which had consolidated before the 13 
December elections began to break up in order to try to win the 
maximum number of mandates in the multi-mandate districts. Thus, 
for example, "Choice of Russia" "fell apart" into "Choice of 
Russia" proper, the Fund for Support of the First RF President, 
"Our City," "Rebirth of Self-Government and Regions," "Action," 
"Rebirth," the Party of Economic Freedom and the Republican 
Party. 
  The opposition forces had not joined together in the last 
elections, and they are also speaking out individually at the 
upcoming ones. The rise in the ratings of the communist and 
socialist organizations which has recently become apparent 
organizationally inspires the leftist opposition embodied by the 
oblast organizations of the CPRF (V. Novoselov), RCWP [Russian 
Communist Workers' Party] (V. Sarvarov), the "Rabochiy" 
["Worker"] association, as well as the association of workers. 
The national-patriots will be represented at the elections by 
"Russian Union" (V. Ilyish). 
  Around 70 percent of the oblast residents polled in February 
of this year had already decided which political forces they 
would vote for. Thirty spoke out in support of the independent 
candidates. Naturally, the results of such a survey do not yet 
warrant far-reaching conclusions. However, they did illuminate 
certain tendencies and proportions. We may assume that the 
future oblast Duma will be divided into four parts: One-fourth 
will represent the democratic orientation, one-fifth--the 
centrist, another one-fifth--the opposition, and one-third will 
remain with the "independents." The final breakdown of forces in 
the Duma, of course, will depend on the degree of "independence" 
of the latter, and one conclusion is apparent already today: The 
deputies of this Duma are simply doomed to cooperation, and this 
will require of them a high degree of political and purely human 
tolerance.

Administration: "The Start of the `Great Depression'? On the 
Socio-Economic Development of Sverdlovsk Oblast in the First 
Quarter of 1994"] 
  [Text] In the first quarter of the current year, 
oblast industrial enterprises produced products (work, services) 
in the amount of 2754.0 billion rubles (R) in effective prices, 
including R1097.2 billion in March. This exceeds by 4.8 and 4.5 
times, respectively, the level for the corresponding periods of 
last year. In comparable prices, the volumes of production have 
declined by 26.5 percent as compared with the level of the first 
quarter of 1993, and for March--by 28.4 percent. This is 
evidence of the decline in output of basic types of products by 
enterprises in all sectors of industry. The scope of reduction 
in product output differs significantly by sectors and types of 
production. 
<H8>  Industry </H8>
  Due to the reduced demand, production in ferrous metallurgy 
in the first quarter declined as compared to the level of the 
corresponding period last year. For finished rolled stock this 
decline comprised 11.2 percent, for low-alloy steel rolled stock 
it was 55.6 percent, for bent sections--by 60.8 percent, for 
cold-rolled sheet stock--by 79.5 percent, and for steel--by 13.9 
percent. At the same time, the smelting of cast iron increased 
by 8,900 tonnes (0.7 percent). Its growth was noted at only one 
enterprise--the Nizhnetagilsk Metallurgical Combine (by 31,200 
tonnes). 
  The changes in market conditions on the domestic and world 
markets and the high, world-level, prices on aluminum sharply 
limited the demand, as a result of which the volume of aluminum 
production declined by 15.8 percent. 
  In machine building, due to the decrease in solvent demand 
of 
consumers, there was a significant reduction in the output of 
many types of goods. Thus, the production of oil drilling 
equipment declined by 34.2 percent, of chemical equipment--by 
57.3 percent, metallurgical equipment--by 55.7 percent, and 
equipment for light industry--by 81.2 percent. 
  Due to the shortage of the necessary raw goods and materials 
(domestic as well as those coming from abroad), the volume of 
production in the enterprises of the chemical and petrochemical 
industry was reduced by 20.1 percent. This included a decline in 
production of sulphuric acid by 28,400 tonnes (or 16.1 percent), 
of synthetic resins and plastics--by 5,900 tonnes (40.7 
percent), of polyvinylchloride plastics--by 587 tonnes (24.2 
percent), and of automobile tires and motorcycle covers--by 26 
percent. 
  The enterprises of the lumber, wood processing and 
cellulose-paper industry continue to reduce production of basic 
types of products. In the lumber industry, the output of 
commercial lumber declined by more than one-third as compared 
with the level for the corresponding period last year. This has 
led to a reduction in production of many types of products in 
the sector: Lumber (by 197,000 cubic meters, or 32 percent), 
plywood (by 3,932 cubic meters, or 20.3 percent), fiberboard (by 
1.5 times), and prefabricated wood houses (by 7.6 times). In the 
cellulose-paper industry, as a result of difficulties with the 
sale of products which have increased many times over in price, 
the output of paper has declined by 3,625 tonnes (55.7 percent). 
At the same time, the output of writing and notebook paper has 
declined by 2.7 times, and of cardboard--by 6.4 times. 
  In the building materials industry, the rate of decline in 
product production as compared with the level of the 
corresponding period for last year comprised: For cement--33.7 
percent, asbestos--0.6-48.4 percent, masonry materials--20.3 
percent, and pane glass--40.6 percent. This was the result of a 
decline in the volumes of construction. 
  The overall decline in industrial production, the decline in 
demand and the reduction in provision of electrical power to 
consumers as a result of their many months of indebtedness to 
power producers, as well as interruptions in fuel deliveries, 
and specifically Ekibaztuz coal, all had an impact on the state 
of affairs in electrical power production. In the first quarter 
of this year, electrical power generation declined by 17.2 
percent as compared with the corresponding period for last year. 
<H8>  Volume of consumer goods production </H8>
  For the first quarter of the current year, the volume of 
consumer goods production comprised R464.7 billion, which is 
20.8 percent below the level for the corresponding period last 
year. This includes the output of R182.0 billion in food 
products. 
  In the first quarter, the production of 3 out of 12 basic 
types of food products increased as compared with the level for 
the corresponding period last year. These were: Meat and 
category 1 by-products (increase of 7.2 percent), sausage goods 
(25.9 percent), and mayonnaise (13.6 percent). However, there 
were 20.3 percent less whole-milk products produced, 13.4 
percent less butter, 22.3 percent less margarine, 17.8 percent 
less bread and bakery goods, 6.4 percent less confectionery 
goods, 25.1 percent less fish products, 3.7 percent less flour 
and 27.9 percent less cereals. 
  The volume of production of wine and vodka products for the 
reporting period declined by more than half as compared with the 
level for the corresponding period last year. Out of 9 titles of 
non-food items which are in everyday demand, and on which 
observation is conducted, the output of 8 titles declined in the 
first quarter. The most significant decline was seen in 
production of all types of fabrics (by 76.7 percent), leather 
shoes (by 60.6 percent), and woven footwear (by 70.3). The 
output of children's goods, being the least profitable, 
continues to decline at a faster rate than other light industry 
goods. Thus, the production of children's shoes declined by 73.4 
percent as compared with the corresponding level for last year, 
and of tricot goods--by 36.2 percent. 
  For a number of household appliance goods (washing machines, 
electric teapots, radio receivers), the output declined by 70-75 
percent as compared with the level for the first quarter of last 
year. 
  The production of steel enamel-coated cookware and needles 
for household sewing machines decreased significantly (by 90 
percent), as did the production of porcelain-china dishware (by 
44.0 percent). 
<H8>  Capital construction </H8>
  In the first quarter of the current year, enterprises held 
under all forms of ownership in the oblast assimilated R349.4 
billion in capital investments, which is 7.6 times higher than 
the level for the corresponding period last year. At the same 
time, prices on construction products increased by 9.5 times. Of 
the overall volume, the greatest relative share of capital 
investments falls to state enterprises and organizations--R207.9 
billion (59 percent of the volume of capital investments). 
R214.8 billion (61 percent) were used for construction of 
facilities to be used for production. 
  Centralized capital investments in the oblast's national 
economy for the first quarter comprised R67.5 billion (72 
percent of the level for the corresponding period last year). Of 
those, local budget funds comprised R50.6 billion (77 percent), 
federal budget funds--R16.9 billion (59 percent), funds of 
enterprises and organizations themselves--R247.9 billion (83 
percent), preferential investment credits--R1.3 billion (96 
percent), and state extra-budgetary investment funds--R32.7 
billion (73 percent). 
  In the non-production sphere, R134.7 billion were 
assimilated 
(39 percent of the volume of capital investments, as compared 
with 43 percent in the first quarter of last year). Of those, 
housing construction comprised R99.3 billion (74 percent of the 
volume of capital investments in facilities of non-production 
function), public health facilities--R5.7 billion (4 percent), 
children's preschool institutions--R1.1 billion (0.8 percent), 
general education schools--R3.7 billion (3 percent), municipal 
services facilities--R16.4 billion (12 percent), and other 
facilities--R8.4 billion (6 percent). 
  For the reporting period, enterprises held under all forms 
of 
ownership placed into operation 2,274 apartments with total area 
of 138,500 square meters (76 percent of the level for the first 
quarter of last year). Among these were 34 apartments in rural 
areas with total area of 4,300 square meters (144 percent). 
State enterprises channeled R45.5 billion in capital investments 
into housing construction (46 percent of the volume of capital 
investments), and placed into operation 52,300 square meters of 
housing (38 percent of the overall operational introduction). 
Municipal enterprises respectively introduced R24.9 billion (25 
percent) and 47,800 square meters (35 percent); mixed 
enterprises--R24.0 billion (24 percent) and 21,900 square meters 
(16 percent), and private enterprises--R5.0 billion (5 percent) 
and 16,500 square meters (11 percent). Through its own funds, 
the public built 59 houses and 60 apartments with overall area 
of 6,431 square meters (100.7 percent). This included 5 houses 
with overall area of 426 square meters (89 percent) placed into 
operation in rural areas. 
<H8>  Transport and communications. </H8>
  The volume of cargo shipped by general use transport 
declined 
by 22.4 million tonnes (37 percent) as compared with the first 
quarter of 1993. Moreover, cargo shipments by railroad transport 
declined by 29 percent and by automobile transport--52 percent, 
while air cargo shipments increased by 5.9 times. The lower 
tariff on cargo shipments by railroad transport led to an 
increase in the relative share of cargo shipped by rail, from 62 
percent in the first quarter of 1993 to 70 percent in the 
reporting year. The sharp increase in the volume of cargo 
shipped by air transport, despite the higher tariffs as compared 
with other types of transport, was caused by the increasing 
entrepreneurial activity. 
  Passenger turnover on general use transport increased by 8 
percent as compared with the first quarter of 1993. Part of the 
population changed over to the relatively cheaper railroad 
transport, where passenger turnover increased by 13 percent. The 
passenger turnover of automobile transport declined by 9 
percent, and of air transport--by 2 percent. Buses along 
suburban and inter-city routes made 7 percent fewer runs, and 4 
percent fewer in cities, as compared with the first quarter of 
last year. 
  By 1 April, 15 general use motor transport enterprises had 
been privatized (24 percent of their overall number). They 
transported 70 percent of the entire volume of cargo and 6 
percent of the passengers. The decline in volume of cargo 
shipments by privatized enterprises comprised 48 percent, and by 
state enterprises--60 percent. 
  For the first quarter of the current year, communications 
enterprises provided R37.2 billion worth of communications 
services, including R10.3 billion worth to the public. In actual 
prices this is 14 times more than in the first quarter of last 
year. 
<H8>  Agriculture </H8>
  PREPARATION FOR SPRING PLANTING. The oblast's 
agricultural enterprises are performing preparatory work for the 
Spring planting. As of 1 April 1994, the oblast's farms were 
generally well provided with seeds of grain and leguminous 
crops. However, potato seeds are not available in full volume, 
since in the Fall of last year the farms in many rayons stored 
poor quality seeds. By the start of April of the current year, 
the relative share of substandard seeds of Spring grain crops 
remains high, and comprised 11 percent. The amount of first 
class sowing-standard seeds on hand comprises 9 percent, and 
second class--34 percent. 
  In March, the rate of preparation of farm equipment for 
sowing had increased somewhat. However, the amount of equipment 
which is in a state of disrepair exceeds the level for 1 April 
of last year, and comprises 27 percent of the available tractors 
(8 percent greater than for the corresponding date last year), 
24 percent of trucks (5 percent greater), 30 percent of tractor 
sowers (11 percent greater), and 35 percent of the 
tractor-pulled plows (8 percent greater). A considerable portion 
of such equipment in Achitskiy, Verkhoturskiy, Garinskiy, 
Tavdinskiy and Tugulymskiy Rayons has not been repaired. 
  The question of providing the farms with basic types of 
petroleum products remains acute. The availability of diesel 
fuel in the agricultural enterprises as of 1 April 1994 
comprised 4,700 tonnes (34 percent of the level of last year), 
and gasoline--3,800 tonnes (47 percent). Moreover, in Artinskiy, 
Baykalovskiy, Verkhoturskiy, Garinskiy, Irbitskiy, 
Kamyshlovskiy, N.-Lyapinskiy, Severskiy, Taborinskiy, Talitskiy 
and Shalinskiy Rayons the reserves of diesel fuel and gasoline 
comprise less than half of the reserves available on the same 
date last year. We might add that the reserves of diesel fuel 
cover only 8 percent of the needs of farms in performing the 
sowing, and of gasoline--only 14 percent. 
  LIVESTOCK RAISING. The decline in herd size of 
livestock and poultry continued in the first quarter of the 
current year. As of 1 April 1994, the number of cattle comprised 
489,700 head (89 percent of the level for the corresponding 
period in 1993), including cows--191,500 (91 percent), 
pigs--311,200 (85 percent), and poultry--13,622,000 head (95 
percent). Also, there were 6 percent fewer calves born, and 20 
percent fewer piglets. Losses from epizootic disease and deaths 
surpassed last year's level by 70 and 45 percent, respectively. 
  For the reporting period, agricultural enterprises sold 
34,600 tonnes of livestock and poultry to slaughter, and 
obtained 113,200 tonnes of milk and 327.9 million chicken eggs. 
For the reporting period of the current year, 32,700 tonnes of 
livestock and poultry went to state resources (105 percent of 
the level for the corresponding period of 1993) at an average 
purchase price of R934,000 per tonne; 88,800 tonnes of milk (82 
percent) at R170,000 per tonne, and 244.9 million eggs (86 
percent) at R68,000 per thousand. Eighty-eight tonnes of 
livestock and poultry and 297 tonnes of milk were purchased from 
individual farmers. 
  On 1 April of this year there were 3,100 peasant (individual 
farmer) farms registered, which were given 92,600 hectares of 
land, or an average of 29.5 hectares for each farmer. In the 
last two years, 616 individual farmers ceased their activity for 
various reasons. 
  In the first quarter of the current year, land continued to 
be parcelled out to citizens. 2,400 families received 271 
hectares of land for the purpose of developing collective 
orchardry, and 6 hectares were parcelled out to 375 families for 
collective gardens. 
<H8>  Prices and tariffs </H8>
  In the first quarter of 1994, the rate of inflation was 
significantly lower than in the fourth quarter of last year. The 
consumer price index on goods and services in March comprised 
133.7 percent of the level for December of 1993. If we do not 
count the non-essential goods and services, this figure is 136 
percent (in the fourth quarter of 1993 these figures were 165.4 
and 163.4 percent, respectively). The rates of inflation on the 
full range of goods and services in January and February 
comprised 11.6 percent and in March--7.4 percent. Discounting 
non-essential goods and services, in January this figure was 
11.5 percent, in February--12.2 percent, and in March--8.7 
percent. 
  As they did last year, the prices and tariffs on paid 
services provided to the population increased in greater amount, 
exhibiting a growth of 2.8 times. The growth of prices on food 
products for the quarter comprised 27.4 percent, and on non-food 
products--21.2 percent. Of the food products, the greatest price 
increases since the beginning of the year have been on milk and 
dairy products, fish, cheeses, vegetables, canned vegetables, 
potatoes and salt (by 1.5-1.7 times). Of the non-food products, 
the greatest price increases were on printed publications (by 2 
times) and medicines (by 1.6 times). 
  The minimum standard food ration in March was estimated at 
R49,800 rubles, and as compared with December of 1993 its amount 
increased by R16,400 rubles, or by 1.5 times. 
  The greatest increase in rates on paid services provided to 
the population took place for municipal services: Rents in 
houses of the municipal housing fund increased by 47 times on 
the average throughout the oblast, fees for hot water supply--by 
13 times, for cold water and sewage--by 11 times, and for 
heating--by 9 times. Rates for payment of housing and municipal 
services in various cities (rayons) of the oblast added up to 
the following amounts: Rent--R11-R120 for a square meter of 
general housing area; heating--R35-R200 rubles per meter; hot 
water supply--R100-R870; cold water and sewage--R68-R742 per 
person per month. 
  In the first quarter of 1994, the rates of growth in 
consumer 
prices and wholesale prices on products of industrial 
enterprises came closer together. In March, wholesale prices 
increased by 40.3 percent as compared with the level for 
December of 1993 (in the fourth quarter of 1993 by 52.8 
percent). As compared with the level of the fourth quarter of 
last year, the rate of growth in wholesale prices declined on 
products of all sectors of industry except non-ferrous 
metallurgy and the liquor-vodka industry, in which the repeal of 
regulated commercial prices on vodka led to a sharp jump in 
wholesale prices. The rates of growth in prices were influenced 
by the shortage of monetary resources held by consumers of 
industrial products, which was caused by the tightening of the 
credit-finance policy as well as by the growth of mutual 
indebtedness of consumers and suppliers. 
<H8>  Finances </H8>
  In the first quarter of this year, the consolidated budget 
of 
Sverdlovsk Oblast received revenues of R361.7 billion, which is 
4.4 times greater than the level for the corresponding period 
for last year. Due to the unsatisfactory financial state of 
enterprises and organizations, the debt on payments to the 
oblast and local budgets continues to grow. On 1 April of the 
current year its amount reached R149.2 billion. 
  Budget expenditures increased by 5 times and comprised 
R364.0 
billion. R99.4 billion was directed to financing the national 
economy, R100.7 billion to public education, R95.3 billion to 
public health and physical culture, R9.5 billion to culture and 
art, R0.3 billion to science, and R14.2 billion in compensation 
payments for children. 
  The consolidated oblast budget showed a deficit of R2.3 
billion. 
  For January-February, the sum of profits obtained by oblast 
enterprises and organizations comprised R440.9 billion. At the 
same time, 545 out of 2,000 enterprises studied suffered losses 
in the sum of R28.8 billion. Of these, R5.1 billion was in 
industry, R18.5 billion in transport, around R1.8 billion in 
trade and public catering, and R0.6 billion in housing and 
municipal services. 
  The credit indebtedness of industrial, construction, 
transport and agricultural enterprises and organizations on 1 
March comprised R2063.2 billion, including R761.6 billion in 
overdue debts, or 36.9 percent. Of this, the largest part was 
comprised of indebtedness to suppliers--R555.3 billion, or 73 
percent. 
  On 1 March the overdue indebtedness comprised R1970.4 
billion, including R752.3 billion, or 88.5 percent, being the 
overdue consumer indebtedness. 
<H8>  Commodity turnover </H8>
  In the first quarter of the current year, the volume of 
retail goods turnover was formulated in the sum of R741 billion, 
which in actual prices is 6.8 times greater than the 
corresponding period for last year, and in comparable prices--by 
17.6 percent. Trade services to the oblast population are 
provided by 8,334 retail trade enterprises and 3,712 public 
catering enterprises. R690 billion worth of consumer goods were 
sold to the population, and R51 billion worth of products in 
public catering. The relative share of food products in the 
volume of goods turnover increased from 53 percent to 57 percent 
in the reporting year, while that of non-food products declined 
from 47 to 43 percent. 
  With the formation of an oblast consumer's market, trade on 
the kolkhoz markets is beginning to win stronger positions. 
Thus, after the systematic decline in sales volumes over the 
last few years, the sale of most agricultural products in the 
first quarter of this year increased as compared with the level 
for the corresponding period last year: The sale of potatoes 
doubled, of vegetables--increased by 2.5 times, and of meat--by 
1.3 times. Over R5 billion were earned from the sale of 
agricultural products at kolkhoz markets. 
  The oblast population acquired R320.8 billion worth of 
non-food items through the retail trade network. The reduction 
in volume of sale testifies to the re-distribution of monetary 
expenditures of the population in favor of the purchase of food 
products. Despite this, the public demand for goods in light 
industry, cultural-domestic and household durables remains high. 
  The volume of sale of clothing and underwear increased by 
1.3 
times in comparable prices as compared with the level for 
January of 1993, of stocking-hoisery goods--by 1.4 times, of 
tricot goods and shoes--by 2 times, of cotton fabrics--by 2.6 
times, and of silk fabrics--by 4.1 times. There were 22,600 
radio receivers sold (98.3 percent), 22,300 televisions (146.7 
percent), and 9,900 refrigerators (180 percent). 
  FOREIGN TRADE TURNOVER in Sverdlovsk oblast for 
the first quarter of 1994 comprised $189.5 million, and 
increased by 2.5 times as compared with the corresponding period 
last year. 
  The export of products equalled $168.8 million, and 
increased 
by more than 3 times. These figures included: Export to the 
industrially developed countries--$59.0 million (increased by 
1.8 times), to the developing countries--$19.8 million (by 3 
times), and to other countries (former CEMA countries, China, 
KPDR [Korean People's Democratic Republic], the republics of the 
former Yugoslavia, and the Baltic countries)--$90.0 million (by 
8.6 times). 
  Within the volume of export, the relative share of raw goods 
and materials comprises 96.9 percent, including ferrous 
metals--76.5 percent, non-ferrous metals--18.2 percent, and 
machinery and equipment--1.3 percent. The relative share of 
consumer goods within the overall volume of export comprises 1.8 
percent. There were 599,000 tonnes of ferrous metals and 
products from them exported (export deliveries of copper and 
ferroalloys increased by 1.2 times, while aluminum deliveries 
declined by 3.5 times); 444 tonnes of lumber (deliveries 
declined by 6.5 times), and $2.2 million worth of machinery and 
equipment (deliveries increased by 6.3 times). 
  The increase in rates and the introduction of new import 
tariffs had the effect of reducing the volume of import by 1.2 
times as compared with last year's level. The import of consumer 
goods decreased--individual types of food products, textile and 
tricot clothing and footwear. 
  Import comprised $20.7 million, including $16.1 million from 
the industrially developed countries (an increase of 38 
percent), $0.8 million from the developing countries (a decline 
of 72 percent), and $3.8 million from other countries. 
  The foreign trade balance was positive in the amount of 
$148.1 million (in the first quarter of 1993 there was a 
positive trade balance in the amount of $27.1 million). 
  MONETARY INCOME OF THE POPULATION in the first 
quarter comprised R1184 billion, which is 5.7 times higher than 
the level for the first quarter of last year. Taking into 
consideration the correction of income for the consumer price 
index, it declined by 15.5 percent for the reporting period. 
  Labor wages comprise 58.4 percent of the income, social 
payments comprise 14.6 percent, and other payments account for 
27 percent. At the same time, the average monthly labor wage 
comprised R148,400, including R171,300 in March, which is 19.2 
percent higher than the level for February and 28.2 percent 
higher than the December 1993 level. 
  EXPENDITURES BY THE POPULATION for the purchase of 
goods and payment of services in the first quarter of the 
current year comprised R815 billion, which is 6 times greater 
than in the first quarter of 1993. Expenditures for payment of 
taxes and fees were R113 billion (5.3 times greater), and for 
the growth of savings in investments and securities--R87 billion 
(10.9 times greater). 
  The growth of expenditures by the population somewhat 
exceeded the increase in nominal monetary income in the first 
quarter of the current year as compared with the corresponding 
period last year. The volume of money on hand increased by R125 
billion and on 1 April of this year comprised R169 billion. 
Expenditures of the population in March were 21.9 percent higher 
than in December of 1993. Moreover, consumer expenditures 
increased by 24.9 percent, while expenditures for payment of 
services increased by 72.4 percent. 
  The DIFFERENTIATION OF THE POPULATION BY LEVEL OF 
AVERAGE PER CAPITA MONETARY INCOME continues to increase in 
the current year. In March of the current year, the income of 
the most well-to-do 10 percent of the population exceeded by 9.5 
times the income of the same portion of persons who were least 
well off. Here we should note that the PROPERTY 
DIFFERENTIATION OF THE POPULATION is not yet as significant 
as the differentiation by level of income. This is confirmed by 
the data of household surveys. 
<H8>  Employment of the population </H8>
  The number of workers engaged in the oblast's national 
economy comprises 1,737,900 persons (not counting those working 
in small enterprises). As compared with the first quarter of 
last year, the number of employed persons has declined by 5.0 
percent. 
  The number of citizens contacting the employment service on 
questions of job placement comprised 41,500 persons at the end 
of the first quarter. Of those, 16,400 persons, or 51.7 percent, 
were women. 
  As of 1 April 1994, there were 39,800 persons registered as 
being unemployed. Of those, 33,600 persons received the official 
status of being unemployed, with payment of unemployment 
benefits. According to the employment service data, the demand 
for workers reported by enterprises comprised 7,732 persons on 1 
April 1994. Without taking into consideration the structure, 
there are 5 unemployed persons competing for each vacant 
position in the employment service. 
  During the first quarter, 2,331 persons participated in 
strikes due to delays in payment of wages. The largest of the 
three registered strikes was the one-day work stoppage by 
workers at the PO [production association] "Vakhrushevugol," in 
which 2,047 persons participated. The total losses of work time 
comprised 3,098 man-days, and products in the sum of R257.9 
million were not produced. 
<H8>  Demographic situation </H8>
  The population numbers in Sverdlovsk Oblast on 1 January 
1994 
comprised 4,666,700 persons, including 4,067,900 urban 
residents, and 598,800 rural residents. 
  The birth rate in the first quarter of the current year 
remained at last year's level, and comprised 8.7 births per 
1,000 members of the population. This testifies to a certain 
stabilization of the birth rate. 
  At the same time, the continuing growth in the mortality 
rate 
of the population evokes concern. The number of deaths in the 
first quarter of the current year increased by 4,400, and the 
mortality rate increased from 14.8 to 18.7 per 1,000 residents. 
One third of those who died were persons of working age. A 
1.3-time increase in the mortality rate due to illnesses of the 
respiratory organs has been noted, as well as a 1.2-time 
increase in mortality due to infectious and parasitic diseases. 
  The unfavorable changes in the mortality rate have led to an 
increase in the natural decline of the population by 1.6 times. 
It comprised 11,500 persons. 
  There has been a significant change in the character of the 
migration processes. While in the first quarter of last year we 
observed a departure of the population from rural areas, at the 
present time we are noting a migrational increase. Since the 
beginning of the year, 436 refugee families have come to our 
oblast, numbering 859 persons, as well as 377 families who were 
forced to resettle, numbering 825 persons (children comprise 31 
percent, persons of able-bodied age--62 percent). Most of these 
people came from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and 
Tajikistan. They settled primarily in the large cities of the 
oblast. Only 10 percent of the newcomers settled in rural areas. 
<H8>  Privatization </H8>
  As of 1 April 1994, there were 3,089 enterprises privatized 
in the oblast, including 261 in the first quarter of the 
reporting year. Of the overall number of privatized enterprises, 
74.9 percent were bought outright, and 9.1 percent of those--in 
the reporting period. 
  During the reporting period, 3,358,700 shares of stock were 
put up for sale by 81 joint-stock companies, for a sum of 
R3499.6 million. Of those, it is presumed that shares in the sum 
of R1659.1 million will be sold through closed bidding. 56.5 
percent of the shares have been handed over to the property fund 
for free sale. 2,200 shares of stock were sold at auction for a 
sum of R2.2 million, and the rest are in the management of the 
privatization agencies. 
  The revenue received from privatization of enterprises 
(facilities), including joint-stock companies, was R4237.5 
million. 90.6 percent of the revenues were received from 
enterprise-buyers, and 9.4 percent from the personal funds of 
citizens. There were 171,100 privatization vouchers received. 
The privatization of enterprises held in municipal ownership 
yielded R2427.3 million (57.3 percent), in oblast 
ownership--R113.7 million (2.7 percent), and in federal 
ownership--R1696.5 million (40 percent). 
  During the first quarter, there were 30,247 apartments 
handed 
over to individual ownership of citizens, which comprises 2.5 
percent of the number of apartments subject to privatization. 
The overall area of the privatized apartments comprised 
1,379,000 square meters, and their overall cost comprised R13663 
million. Altogether since the beginning of privatization, 
394,973 apartments (33 percent) have been handed over and sold 
to citizens for private ownership.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Debts of the USSR Savings Bank: The </F>
Question, of Course, Is Interesting"] 
  [Text] When will the trade obligations of the Union 
Savings Bank for special-purpose checks, bonds, and certificates 
be paid off, how will it proceed, and who will assume the 
payment?... 
  These questions are troubling the owners of checks. Citizens 
of the local administration are also asking them. Therefore, the 
mayor's office of Novosibirsk asked the Ministry of Finance of 
Russia for an explanation. 
  The reply, signed by M. Chekurova, deputy director of the 
Securities Department of the Ministry of Finance of Russia, 
states: 
  "In accordance with Decree No. 344 of the Government of the 
Russian Federation of 16 April 1994 'On State Debt Trade 
Obligations,' the Ministry of Finance, from 15 June 1994 to 1 
June 1995, through the system of institutions of the Savings 
Bank of the Russian Federation, and other banks determined by 
the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, will redeem 
1990 non-interest- bearing bonds of state special-purpose loans 
from owners for appropriate domestically produced consumer 
commodities (except passenger cars) at existing consumer prices, 
and for passenger cars--based on 60 percent of the price 
determined by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, 
in coordination with plant manufacturers. 
  "In a priority procedure, the indicated bonds will be 
redeemed from invalids and participants in the Great Patriotic 
War and invalids of the Armed Forces. 
  "The procedure for the redemption of special-purpose loan 
bonds will be developed by the Ministry of Finance of the 
Russian Federation together with the Savings Bank of the Russian 
Federation in the near future." 
  As Tamara Aleksandrovna Lyubimets, deputy chairman of the 
Novosibirsk bank of the Savings Bank of Russia, reported to the 
editorial office at "Krasnyy Prospekt 34," if merchandise is 
issued for all trade bonds for all citizens from 1 July of this 
year to 1 June of 1995 (and only for invalids of the Armed 
Forces and participants of the Great Patriotic War--from 15 
June), then the redemption of certificates, which ends according 
to the letter of the Savings Bank on 1 March, is extended to 31 
December 1994. 
  In addition, Tamara Aleksandrovna emphasized that the debts 
will be settled by the Savings Banks only on the condition of 
the payment of money for their accounts. The AKSB [expansion not 
identified] of the Russian Federation, not being the legal 
successor of the USSR Savings Bank, at the same time assumed 
settlements with the citizens for certificates, but it will make 
payment at the expense of resources of the federal budget 
allocated in 1994-1995 for these purposes.

<F P=106> [Article by Olga Ort: "Rally of Many Thousands Is Being </F>
Prepared. Will It Be Noticed in Moscow?"] 
  [Text] The presidium of the Council of the Federation of 
Trade Unions of the oblast passed a resolution on 18 May to 
conduct a workers' rally in Novosibirsk on 9 June 1994 at 1500 
on V.I. Lenin Square in support of demands that the president, 
the government, the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, 
the oblast administration, and the mayor of Novosibirsk prevent 
a slump in production, pay wages in a timely and complete way, 
adopt a state employment program, and guarantee citizens' safety. 
  An application for the conduct of a rally was addressed to 
V. 
Tolokonskiy, the city's mayor. The proposed number of 
participants--30,000 persons. There have been no actions on such 
a scale in Novosibirsk since 1992, when a delegation nominated 
here at a rally departed for Moscow "to shake loose" money for 
wages. The trip was successful at that time. But time passed, 
and the needs of Novosibirsk Oblast were forgotten in the 
capital. Our position cannot be called pleasant. Seventy percent 
of the oblast industrial complex consists of defense enterprises 
that are shutting down shops one after the other and sending 
workers on forced leave. The NPO [scientific production 
association] Vostok has been idle since 24 April, the Lenin 
plant has gradually been coming to a stop since 16 May, Kometa 
stopped on 23 May, and the condenser plant has been idle since 1 
May. The Berdsk electromechanical plant is stopping work in two 
stages from 6 to 14 June. Sibselmash is stopping agricultural 
and foundry production starting 1 June. The sorrowful list can 
be continued. In the words of V. Medvedko, director of NEVZ 
[Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Plant], he has already been 
left without half of his skilled personnel. Director of 
Sibtekstilmash Popelyukh says: "Production is stopping--robbery 
is increasing..." 
  It is not especially necessary to explain how the situation 
of the large enterprises will affect the city budget, and this 
means the people who get their wages, pensions, and allowances 
from it. April payments to the budget totaled 17 percent of what 
was planned. Sibselmash alone went into debt to the pension fund 
for 1.2 billion rubles [R]. Sibtekstilmash owes R7 billion and 
Novosibirskenergo R5 billion to the budget. 
  The oblast trade unions hope to attract attention to all 
these problems with the multi-thousand-strong rally. Following 
it, a delegation will go to Moscow with a package of proposals. 
  The oblast trade unions are observing a "nonaggression pact" 
with the government and are not putting forth any kind of 
political demands. Time will tell whether this loyalty will be 
appreciated in Moscow.

<F P=106> [Article by Galina Andreyeva: "Execution of the Ob's </F>
`Sentence' Postponed Until Autumn"] 
  [Text] A report on the situation at sewage pumping 
station No. 14 and the discharge of polluted drainage into the 
Ob, respectively, thoroughly alarmed city residents last 
week. 
  Dust was raised for two days on the winding road that leads 
to a small two-story structure in the valley of the Kamenka 
River, a structure that from its looks is barely noticeable and 
does not in any way reveal anything particular about its 
functional significance to the vital activity of the life of the 
city. In the words of the workers of the pumping station, the 
television reporters and the newspapermen were getting tiresome. 
Although neither the steady drone of the pumps in the KNS 
[sewage pumping station] nor the homey appetizing aroma from the 
domestic area--it was getting close to lunchtime--gave any sign 
indicating an emergency at the station. 
  A.N. Kolesov, the station foreman, clarified the emergency 
in 
question, since the station had not stopped and was operating 
according to the usual regime. 
  However, it was not without reason that the alarm was raised 
in the city regarding the next ecological disaster. This time 
thunder struck in the Maritime region, where the wall of an 
intake reservoir of one of the KNS collapsed. Learning a lesson 
from the mistakes of others, the Gorvodokanal [city water 
channel administration] decided to investigate the condition of 
the pumps in the city. However, it was not possible to execute 
this plan at KNS 14, where the sluice gates, "stop logs," did 
not function, and it was not possible to stop the flow from the 
input collectors. The attempt to establish a temporary gate also 
ended without result. 
  Does every cloud have a silver lining? Alas, no! The defect 
of the sluice gate, according to the statement of the station 
workers, which lies on the conscience of the builders from the 
day the station is put into operation, only postponed the 
prediction of an inevitable massive pollution of the Ob. An 
inspection of the KNS and preventive repair, in any event, 
cannot be avoided. Not only at this station but at all the 
others, and there are about two dozen of them on the city's 
right bank alone. But the total daily volume of city sewage is 
almost 1 million cubic meters. And all this sooner or later 
empties into the river. It is fortunate that the contamination 
from the KNS did not pass on closer to summer. Otherwise, 
farewell to the swimming season. And not only for Novosibirsk 
residents but for the "lower neighbors" as well.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Kondrashov: "When Fifty Thousand Is Not </F>
Money"] 
  [Text] Crime 
  Counterfeiting is probably one of the world's oldest and 
most 
widespread types of crime. In our country it now seems to be 
getting accessible to virtually anyone who wishes. 
  Counterfeit money is circulating throughout Russia. It is 
printed with color Xerox machines, drawn by some skilled 
craftsmen, stamped in printing presses. As acknowledged 
"masters" say, forging a 50,000 bill is easy as pie. Perhaps 
that is why the appearance of forgeries is registered every day 
in some 30-40 regions. 
  Some statistics. During the whole of last year, 607 cases of 
discovering counterfeit bills were recorded in Krasnodar Kray. 
In four months of this year there were already 413 cases. In 
Voronezh Oblast - 184 and 141 respectively. In Moscow Oblast 
there were 374 cases last year and already 239 this year. In 
Rostov Oblast the respective figures are 376 and 291. Tula 
Oblast has simply set a record: 250 cases of exposed counterfeit 
money in four months this year as against 102 cases last year. 
In Tyumen Oblast the figures are 173 and 166. 
  Counterfeits are proliferating extensively even in formerly 
little affected areas. The comparative information is the same: 
data for the whole of last year and four months of this year. 
Yakutia: 9 and 22 cases, respectively. Vladimir Oblast: 4 and 
11. Ivanovo Oblast: 11 and 10. Magadan Oblast: 10 and 62. 
Novosibirsk Oblast: 5 and 51. Sakhalin Oblast: 6 and 21. And so 
on, and so forth. 
  Counterfeiting, once the domain of lone craftsmen, is 
increasingly being put on an industrial footing. Whole groups 
are organizing to manufacture and unload counterfeit money. For 
example, not long ago three criminal groups which used college 
students to distribute "forfeits" [fantiki] were uncovered in 
Samara. In Volgograd, three North-Caucasus residents were 
detained with some 87 million rubles' worth of phony R50,000 
bills. In Smolensk, a group of four counterfeiters and 
distributors was detained. A group of nine people counterfeiting 
Deutchmarks was uncovered in Kaliningrad. A search of them 
netted four SKS carbines, pistols, revolvers, hand-grenades... 
  Here is an excerpt from an MVD report for 23 May 94: "In 
Kemerovo Oblast, OEP [Economic Crimes Department] personnel 
detained K. K. Nikerkhayev, born 1951, non-working, in Yaya 
township for passing off counterfeit bills; 38 counterfeit 
R50,000 bills made on a Xerox machine were confiscated. 
  "In addition, two R5,000 bills, sixty-four R10,000 bills, 
and 
sixty-nine R50,000 bills manufactured on Xerox machines were 
found and confiscated in the Kalmyk and Buryat Republics, 
Krasnodar, Krasnoyarsk and Stavropol Krays, Moscow, Novgorod, 
Pskov, Rostov, Sverdlovsk, Smolensk and Ulyanovsk Oblasts, and 
in the cities of Perm, Voronezh, Izhevsk, Nizniy Novgorod, 
Orenburg and Saransk..." 
  According to some data, the "black gross product" [cherniy 
val] market in Russia totals around 90 trillion rubles. This is 
money which is totally unaccounted for. Incidentally, the 
deficit of our current state budget is only about R70 trillion. 
Naturally, in such conditions counterfeiters feel themselves 
like fish in water. 
  Also in circulation are counterfeit dollars manufactured by 
industrial means, mainly in Poland and the Middle East. The 
quality of these forgeries is so high that sometimes it is 
impossible to distinguish a counterfeit from the original even 
with the help of special equipment. This, however, doesn't make 
a counterfeit less counterfeit. 
  In the near future the MVD expects an upsurge in 
counterfeiting of securities and stocks, which presents no great 
difficulty with the existence of color copier equipment. 
  So far it is extremely difficult to combat this phenomenon. 
The temptation to earn a quick buck at minimum risk is simply 
too great, especially when forgeries come to Russia from 
Chechnya, Azerbaijan and other former soviet republics. 
  So, citizens, be wary: the counterfeiter is not napping.

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Kuptsov, by Erik Kotlyar, under rubric </F>
"Law and Order": "First Interview With New MUR Chief, Exclusive 
for SK Readers"] 
  [Text] It is no secret that the fight against crime 
is spinning its wheels. Accusations leveled at the militia are 
heard on all sides. People say that the fight is being waged 
poorly, that officials are being bought and sold, and that 
criminals are being coddled and retrained as chastisers. And the 
fight is being increasingly drawn into political games that are 
well seasoned with payoffs. There really is no fight at all! Are 
these reproaches justified? Basically, unfortunately, yes, they 
are! For the most part, such facts have been confirmed. But 
there are a few things that are frequently forgotten in the heat 
of the polemics. The structure of the militia includes criminal 
investigation and prosecution services for which the elimination 
of the criminal segment is their direct duty! If society rejects 
that purpose, then those services are no longer needed and 
should simply be abolished or transformed into something else. 
But they do exist, and it is incorrect to say that the fight 
against crime has been completely stopped. It is another matter 
that the results have become the wrong ones! And that the 
services are up to their ears in debt to the taxpayers. 
  Why is this happening? There are several reasons. The 
main one is that the social environment and the modern economic 
order are engendering and multiplying crime in the way that 
dampness gives rise to mold. The rates of its multiplication are 
greatly outstripping the development of those militia agencies 
whose functions include the putting up of resistance to the 
criminal forces (unlike the rates of formation of detachments 
for the protection of law and order). As of today, the criminal 
militia has not gone far in its development from the number of 
personnel in the old times, when the situation was more normal 
and it was possible to walk along the streets in Moscow at 
night, arm in arm with one's girl friend. A second reason is the 
fact that the highest echelon of authority has been corrupted. 
Frequently that echelon sympathetically supports the criminal 
element for their mutual advantage. The third reason is the 
frustration of a society that has been shaken by the 
unprecedented boldness with which the criminal world is invading 
the customary way of life. And, finally, the last reason: the 
frustration of the militia itself, which has become accustomed 
to operating, like every other line service, in accordance with 
a command from above. Fewer and fewer of these commands are 
coming in. But, under conditions of the political instability 
and confusion, it is simply impossible to operate at one's own 
risk. There have been attempts to assume responsibility in 
individual instances, but that did not lead to anything good. 
Several times the "authorities," restrained by the desperate 
risk of protectors of law and order, allowed themselves to get 
under the so-called "pledge," by issuing threats to the 
operational agents and their families. You have to agree that it 
is a lesson that people remember! It is truly a "golden age" for 
all kinds of rogues! 
  Of course, among the militia men there have arisen 
doubts and, in accordance with the customary tradition (and, one 
should not forget, we all have emerged from the Soviet 
authority), searches for the extreme began. Why is it important 
to find the guilty person? Because everyone has bosses, and, as 
everyone knows, those bosses never want to share with anyone the 
responsibility for what is happening! Their task is to analyze 
the situation and punish people! "If you get money (but I 
don't), you'll have to answer!" 
  It is no wonder that, with this kind of disjointed 
resolution of a very serious question, the only thing that we 
have today is the constant rotation of personnel among the 
militia professionals, in the hope that the new employee will be 
luckier than his predecessor. In one of the statements made in 
the State Duma it was stated that workers who have distinguished 
themselves are deliberately removed from the law-enforcement 
system! But this is a special question, and it should be 
analyzed in a special study... 
  It is a fact that today the reason for removing a 
militia employee can be not only his poor performance in the 
precinct, but also his failure to develop the proper on-the-job 
interrelationships. Observing all of this, we are most troubled 
that the person sitting in the chair behind the control panel in 
the fight against crime is not the latest in a series of heating 
specialists. Let me hasten to assure the readers that this has 
not happened. The person who replaced Yu. Fedoseyev at MUR 
[Moscow Criminal Investigation Department] was his deputy, a 
person with a long biography in the militia, who, even in the 
past, frequently executed the direct duties of the UGRO 
[criminal investigation] chief -- Vasiliy Nikolayevich 
Kuptsov. 
  The 42-year-old militia colonel is as erect as an 
athlete and is meager in his words and gestures. He actually 
does have behind him a difficult path from an ordinary militia 
man in 1974 to responsible positions in which the only person 
who can work successfully is one who has had good experience and 
who enjoys authority among his comrades. V. Kuptsov meets all 
these criteria. He graduated from militia school, and then a 
branch of the RF [Russian Federation] MVD Academy. He worked "on 
the ground" as an operational agent in a militia department, and 
was also a department chief, senior operational agent for 
especially important criminal-investigation cases, the first 
deputy RUVD chief, deputy chief of BKhSS [Combatting the 
Embezzlement of Socialist Property and Speculation], and, over a 
considerable period of time, MUR deputy chief. He is very 
knowledgeable about operational work, and, most importantly, 
makes a sober evaluation of the real order of things. The hopes 
of Moscow's criminals that they will have an easy life with the 
arrival of the new MUR chief are apparently in vain. One would 
certainly want to believe and hope that this is so! 
  [Kotlyar] Vasiliy Nikolayevich, you arrived in the job of 
MUR 
chief at what is probably not the most favorable time. All the 
barriers are shaking under the onrush of crime. Do you have your 
own concept or will you develop MUR's traditional work practices? 
  [Kuptsov] I have been working at MUR long enough to assert 
that the experience and traditions of the city's investigation 
administration are unique. They took years to form, and every 
administrator made his own contribution; of course, every one 
who bears responsibility for the assigned job has his own 
approach to those tasks. It is important that the basis of his 
job should be the practical considerations in accordance with 
the requirements of the time. Because crime changes very 
quickly, and failing to take those changes into consideration in 
operational work would be a big mistake! With the development of 
privatization there appeared new methods of taking personal 
savings away from private individuals with the help of various 
swindles. We have introduced certain functional and structural 
changes in the administration's work in order to specialize 
individual links in criminal investigation specifically in those 
types of crimes. The situation is exactly the same in the area 
of crimes against property. The concepts of private and state 
property are identically high-priority in the legal sense. 
Correspondingly there must be a change in the level of 
professionalism in the departments that are engaged in the 
uncovering of crimes against all types of property, including 
private and personal. Incidentally, for the period of transition 
to market relations this is of great political importance. 
  Take, for example, such a type of crime as explosions. 
Previously such unusual cases used to be investigated by us in 
the general work flow. But currently a new type of crime has 
turned into an entire "branch" that has acquired its own 
specialists and underground industry. Consequently, MUR also 
needs a department in which the trained operational agents can 
make an educated evaluation and analyze each occurrence. That 
is, life forces us to carry out a kind of "modernization" of 
investigation as applicable to the "technology" of crime. 
  The same thing can be said about the discovery of illegally 
acquired weapons. Everyone is well aware of how those weapons 
are used. Frequently the people who perish are completely 
innocent individuals who just happened to be at the scene of the 
crime. Previously this phenomenon was viewed as a part of the 
overall picture involving the crime that had been committed. 
Currently we want to achieve the intensification of 
investigation work to such a degree that the guns can be taken 
out of illegal circulation even before they can be fired! In 
order to do that, it will be necessary right now to have our 
employees specialize. One important circumstance is that the 
employees for the new types of work are selected strictly on the 
basis of their on-the- job qualities. Other considerations are 
categorically precluded. We take a very thrifty approach to the 
personnel makeup that has developed at MUR and the city's 
criminal investigation department. 
  [Kotlyar] Vasiliy Nikolayevich, you have mentioned MUR's 
historic heritage. In those departments that will be affected by 
the respecialization, won't the important experience and skills 
that were previously accumulated be lost? 
  [Kuptsov] I can put your mind at ease. MUR will not part 
with 
anything beneficial that it has in its arsenal. 
  [Kotlyar] MUR was constantly understaffed -- something like 
approximately 300 persons in the operational complement. How do 
you propose to fill in that personnel gap? The complication lies 
in the fact that the payment for the labor performed in the 
various militia services is definitely not equal, and criminal 
investigation in the table of organization is viewed not in the 
most favorable light. 
  [Kuptsov] There really is a problem here. Many people are 
more eager to go to the new services where the pay is better. 
But the people who come to MUR are the romantics, who are seized 
and attracted by our unusual job. I hardly think that there is 
anywhere else that an enthusiast would be able to graduate from 
the kind of school for detective service that we have in our 
subdivisions. We have had good experience in training junior 
operational agents. They learn the science of investigating from 
start to finish in our system. From the operational agents we 
create reserves for promotion. The most capable employees who 
have reached the level of skill must definitely have growth 
prospects. The young ambitious person must be assured that if he 
works well, he will definitely by singled out and will be 
trained for promotion. I am convinced that this kind of worker 
will open up his capabilities even more in his next assignment. 
We have certain administrators who like to "hide" their valuable 
workers and keep them for themselves. That is a vicious 
practice. It leads to a situation in which, in the final 
analysis, we are deprived of the people whom we need. For our 
work it is not just enough to have education. It is also 
mandatory to do some work "on the ground," where it is necessary 
to carry out directly the dirty work with criminals. Only then 
will a person reveal his on-the-job qualities and his 
understanding of how it is necessary to act in various 
situations. Those who travel the entire path from the initial 
cell in criminal investigation at a militia station, then 
through the okrug links, and then gradually rise to the city 
administration, are in my opinion people who have substantial 
qualification. For them there are no secrets: they become easily 
oriented, like highly trained professionals. Unfortunately, in 
our service it sometimes happens that workers in the 
administration make disdainful comments about those who are 
working in the initial investigation teams. And the opposite 
situation also occurs. Both groups of people are mistaken. It is 
necessary to have worked at all levels in order to become a 
full-fledged detective or operational agent. 
  As for the unequal payment for their labor, this question, I 
am convinced, will be resolved properly! In the final analysis 
we will achieve a situation in which steady collectives of like- 
minded individuals who are devoted to their city and its 
inhabitants will form gradually at MUR and the city's criminal 
investigation links. 
  [Kotlyar] MUR employs slightly more than 300 people, and the 
number of workers in criminal investigation for the city as a 
whole is 4000. Have you developed a methodology for interaction 
among all the parts of what would seem to be, on the whole, a 
rather large detachment of people? 
  [Kuptsov] Your question is very correct. The bulk of the 
work 
must be conducted only where the crime has been committed. We 
are already taking steps to guarantee the coordination of all 
our subdivisions. Here, as you have correctly noted, we used to 
make a strategic miscalculation. Without the mobile attraction 
of all the city's personnel, it will be impossible to resolve 
the crime problem, even if we increase the MUR apparatus to 
3000! But the share of the central investigation department will 
be a few more uncovered cases! But that will not provide much 
until we achieve a situation in which all the crimes will be 
identified at the place where they were committed. Another 
question is that it is impossible to require the okrug 
departments and stations to uncover all the crimes, irrespective 
of the type of complexity. For example, murders by hire -- for 
work like that we simply do not have enough manpower or 
informational support. In that instance their share will be the 
execution of the overall algorithm for actions -- the processing 
of the housing sector, investigation of the scene of the crime, 
etc. Such cases are within the competency of the city 
administration, and we have opportunities to uncover them. 
Although much also depends here upon the corpus delicti and its 
complexity. Many crimes are within the capabilities of 
specialists from the okrug criminal- investigation links. In 
this respect all the city administrations and departments have 
been given guidelines concerning what types of crimes should be 
uncovered at their level. There must be no formal check-list 
approach here -- not worrying about whether or not it is within 
your capabilities, but just do it for the sake of the record, 
and that's all there is to it! I think that, with the passage of 
time, it might even be possible to reduce the apparatus in the 
city administration, by transferring some of the employees to 
the okrugs. MUR will retain the functions of providing 
consultative and methodological guidance and of monitoring the 
actions of the city's services, and, of course, the work 
involving especially important and dangerous cases. 
  [Kotlyar] Vasiliy Nikolayevich, have you noted any precise 
delimitations in the area of the work between MUR and RUOP? We 
sometimes hear people saying, "This is our job, but that 
isn't..." 
  [Kuptsov] The concept of "our job or not our job" does not 
exist. For Muscovites there is only a single concept -- the city 
militia. And for the victim it is a matter of complete 
indifference as to whether the person who came to his assistance 
is a MUR or RUOP operative. The most important thing is the 
final result. As for our internal evaluations, I think that, in 
the interests of the overall job for which we all are 
responsible, it is necessary to construct the work on principles 
of good interaction and mutual understanding, rendering 
assistance to one another in the name of our common goal. Then 
the results will become obvious, and Muscovites will truly feel 
that they are getting real assistance! 
  [Kotlyar] MUR has a good rule: preserve the, as it were, 
"money- box of experience." That money-box used to be 
represented by a consultative group made up of MUR veterans. 
Others who are being called upon are former administration 
chiefs from wartime and the postwar period and major 
investigative specialists who retired for reasons of age, but 
who are completely capable. Will this undertaking -- which is, 
in our day, a rare and beneficial one -- be preserved in the 
future? 
  [Kuptsov] Not only will it be preserved, but it will also be 
multiplied. These people are the militia's "gold fund." Their 
experience is invaluable. For young detectives they are not only 
help, but also a personal example in behavior and attitude to 
the job. Therefore we shall expand the group of our unique 
specialists: their knowledge and work habits are an important 
contribution to the administration's work. 
  [Kotlyar] During the short period of time in which you have 
been heading MUR, have you encountered any difficult situations? 
  [Kuptsov] Maybe you should have asked me whether I have had 
a 
free moment recently. All you have to do is to glance at the 
summary. Every day there are dozens of corpses, violent 
incidents, attacks... The impression is that we are working in a 
frontline city! The tension has remained unchanged. But I would 
like to direct your attention to something. We have enough 
manpower and enough intellect, but nevertheless the elimination 
of crime is a comprehensive problem. Here it is necessary for 
everyone to participate identically -- the manpower of the 
procurator's office, the city authorities, and, most 
importantly, the public, without which it would be impossible to 
cope with the city's woes! Recently there has been a sense of a 
certain loss of enthusiasm, or maybe a certain disappointment. 
That's bad. I would like to take advantage of the opportunity 
provided to me to make a statement in your esteemed newspaper, 
and to call upon all the healthy forces in Moscow to render all 
the assistance that they can to the militia, to be more 
attentive to everything that is happening around them, and not 
to avoid interacting with the internal-affairs agencies if such 
interaction is required. I also state confidently, on behalf of 
my comrades, that the people at MUR are well aware that the 
basic weight and responsibility for preventing and uncovering 
crimes lie on the shoulders of the militia. 
  [Kotlyar] Thank you, Vasiliy Nikolayevich, for having this 
conversation with me. Please allow me to wish you success in 
your job, which is a very familiar one for you but which is very 
difficult today!

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Ignatenko, doctor of philosophical </F>
sciences, expert of the Gorbachev Foundation: "Last Push? To the 
South!: Russia's Involvement in the Partnership for Peace Could 
Critically Destabilize the Situation on its Southern Flanks"] 
  [Text] It would be utterly unproductive in an 
examination of the Partnership for Peace program and the 
prospects of Russia's participation in it to address it 
alone--the texts of the Invitation, the Framework Agreement, and 
Organization and Procedures. Much should be derived from a 
consideration of the contexts of this program 
also--geopolitical, military-strategic, economic, and others. In 
addition, it is impermissible to ignore also the fact that the 
states of the post-Soviet South--of the Transcaucasus and 
Central Asia--would be drawn into the orbit of NATO's influence 
also. And the situation in this "soft underbelly" of Russia will 
largely determine the future of both the global South and of 
Russia itself. 
<H5>  Russia--Missing Link in the Global Military-Political </H5>
Alliance of the North 
  The consistent and successful realization of NATO's 
Partnership for Peace would impart a finished nature to the 
North-South global opposition. The membership of the Atlantic 
structures of Russia and also all the other components of the 
former great Eurasian state--the Soviet Union--would signify the 
emergence of a global military-political bloc of states of the 
North (the northern hemisphere). 
  The North's line of contact with the South, this global zone 
of instability, does not run along the Equator, of course. For 
the United States, Canada, and Mexico it is the narrow isthmus 
of Panama. North America is protected from Asia and Africa with 
their vast South by two oceans. For West Europe this boundary is 
the Mediterranean. There are some remnants of the South in the 
former Yugoslavia still, it is true, but they could soon be 
wiped out. 
  In other words, this part of the North is protected against 
the destabilizing factors of the South by natural barriers. This 
North is doing and will continue to do everything possible to 
bar to states of the South as far as possible, if not in full, 
access to weapons of mass destruction, primarily nuclear, and to 
their delivery systems capable of delivering these weapons to 
the North. The examples of the pressure on Iraq, Iran, Libya, 
Syria, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are typical in this 
respect. The North even looks askance at Israel. 
  But with Russia things are considerably more complicated. 
Russia is in direct, immediate contact with the South. So 
immediate that it is not always clear where Russia ends and 
where this notorious South begins. According to one version 
("each for himself"), Russia borders the post-Soviet South--the 
Transcaucasus and Central Asia, that is, zones of extremely high 
conflict potential. It is sufficient to recall the 
Abkhaz-Georgian, Karabakh, and Tajik conflicts and a mass of 
others--of a lesser scale or occurring in latent fashion. 
  In the other version ("Russia as an integral part of the CIS 
with vital interests in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia") 
Russia--both directly and indirectly--is in contact with another 
conflict-potential zone, which is to no less an extent rich in 
factors of instability: the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Kurdish 
problem (Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria), the Afghan problem (the 
civil war in Afghanistan and this state's practical 
disintegration), the Pakistani-Indian contradictions (the 
problem of Jammu and Kashmir), Uighur separatism (China's 
Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous District), and so forth. 
<H5>  Russia--Pacifier of the South? </H5>
  Let us assume that Russia has subscribed to the Partnership 
and/or has actively begun to participate in NATO actions in some 
other form. All questions would then confront it in entirely 
particular fashion, if Russia is in contact with the South, 
being part of the global military-political alliance of the 
northern hemisphere (the North). Historical circumstances 
themselves would impose on Russia the role of gendarme covering 
the global North on one of its "burning" flanks and locking onto 
itself many most acute problems of North-South relations on a 
world scale. 
  Why would Russia involuntarily find itself in this role? I 
see at least three reasons here. 
  First, peacemaking operations or, in NATO terminology, 
"peacekeeping operations" are envisaged by both the plans of 
NATO and the NACC (North Atlantic Cooperation Council) and the 
content of the Partnership for Peace program itself (clause 3-D 
of the Framework Agreement). The actual force capable of 
undertaking broad-based peacemaking operations on the territory 
of the CIS and in the entire post-Soviet space is the Russian 
Army. Evidence of this is the correlation of the participants 
and the degree of their assertiveness in the CIS Collective 
Peacemaking Force in Tajikistan. 
  Second, "peacekeeping operations" are at this moment the 
priority direction in NATO activity, virtually. We would recall 
Somalia, Bosnia, and even Egypt (the participation of NATO 
consultants in the organization of the struggle against Islamic 
fundamentalists in this country). A special zone of NATO 
interests in this respect, incidentally, is the Caucasus region 
(see, in particular, clause 03 of the section "Questions of 
Policy and Security." Supplement to "Curriculum of the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council for Dialogue, Partnership, and 
Cooperation in 1994"). The same applies also to post-Soviet 
Central Asia, the "projection" of stability onto which is, 
according to a statement of Manfred Woerner, general secretary 
of NATO, a principal function of the North Atlantic alliance. A 
number of NATO "peacekeeping operations" have shown the 
direction in which the tactics of such operations are evolving, 
these contemplating the active enlistment in direct combat 
operations of the peacekeeping subunits and covering units. 
  Third, Russia would very much like to take part in 
peacemaking operations on the territory of the CIS. One has the 
impression that certain influential Russian politicians and 
military figures, not without peasant cunning, see such activity 
as a convenient form of the restoration of Russian influence in 
"zones of Russia's vital interests." If they are lucky, what is 
more, with these operations being funded and a mandate for them 
being granted by any party--the United Nations, the CSCE, the 
CIS... and NATO? 
  Fourth, the talk about the danger of "Islamic 
fundamentalism" 
(P. Grachev and A. Kozyrev and B. Yeltsin have already spoken 
about it in the appropriate manner) puts us on our guard. A 
number of influential Russian politicians and military personnel 
are prepared, it would seem, to turn Russia into a kind of 
barrier against so-called "Islamic fundamentalism," moving up to 
the forward lines of contact with it. 
<H5>  How To Destroy Russia </H5>
  Were this conjecture to be realized, Russia's future would 
seem utterly bleak. On its "southern" flank Russia (like the CIS 
as a whole) is exceptionally vulnerable. A border, which is 
designed to perform a protective function, with the new 
independent states of the post-Soviet South (in the regions of 
the Caucasus and Central Asia) is lacking; in a number of 
sectors the external border of the CIS here is eroded and 
penetrable (to a varying extent) in both directions (the 
Iranian-Azerbaijani, Afghanistan-Uzbekistan, Afghanistan-Tajik, 
and other sectors). 
  Russia could find itself--voluntarily or involuntarily, for 
reasons, at times, not even susceptible to predictions based on 
the logic of common sense--pulled into a number of conflicts. 
Primarily the Tajik, Abkhaz, South Ossetian, or Karabakh, which 
are now "habitual." It is difficult for Russia even now in its 
attempts to extinguish these centers of military danger situated 
in direct proximity to its borders. But the difficulties could 
grow many times over were Russia to operate under the aegis of 
NATO or within the framework of NATO programs. We can imagine 
the frustration of the leadership of Georgia and Azerbaijan, 
which, endeavoring to protect themselves against Russian 
peacemaking, had hastened to sign the "framework agreement" (in 
March and May of this year respectively) and which, as a result, 
could get those same Russian troops as peacemakers. Whatever the 
case, Russia would not, in any event, manage to preserve a 
normal relationship with all the parties to the conflicts on the 
territory of the post-Soviet South, and the resistance to it of 
some parties would be assured. 
  A particular danger of the situation for Russia is the fact 
that there is no clear-cut border between the non-Russian South 
within the framework of the CIS and the purely Russian South. It 
is sufficient to recall here the North Caucasus (that is, 
Russian!) operational formations--from subunits of the 
Confederation of Peoples of the Caucasus through the 
Cossacks--that participated (are participating) actively in the 
Transcaucasus conflicts: Karabakh, South Ossetian, Abkhaz. It is 
hard to foresee the details and the routes by which the 
conflagration of the conflicts being "pacified" could spread. 
But some directions are easily defined: the zones of the spread 
of Islam and of the settlement of Turkic peoples on the 
territory of Russia. 
  What the response of the states of the traditional South to 
the globalization of NATO and the conversion of the border of 
the CIS or a part thereof into the NATO border would be is a 
special and very difficult question. For Iraq, Iran, and Syria 
border Turkey--a NATO member. Desert Storm (1991), on the other 
hand, demonstrated together with many other things, it is true, 
a readiness for cooperation even on the part of sworn enemies (I 
would recall the coordinated crossing to Iranian territory of 
Iraqi aircraft to preserve them from American strikes). But 
Russia, were it to find itself NATO's southern flank, would have 
to assume assignments pertaining to elimination of the nuclear 
missile programs in such countries as Iran, Iraq, India, 
Pakistan, and Syria for the realization of one further NATO 
goal--blocking these countries' missile programs for protection 
against missile attacks against the forward and expeditionary 
units of NATO and its allies. 
  Opposition to so-called "Islamic fundamentalism" as a 
strategic goal, Russia's conversion into an outpost of this 
struggle--all this would necessarily evoke and exacerbate 
hostility between Russia and, at a minimum, Iran (it is usually 
seen as the source of "Islamic fundamentalism") and, possibly, 
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and more distant Near and Middle East 
neighbors also. 
  Nor can Russia's involvement as a "peacemaker" in conflicts 
that the world community imposes on itself and that blaze or 
merely flare up in direct proximity to Russia's borders be ruled 
out. The Kurdish problem is already making itself felt quite 
nearby--on the Turkish-Armenian border. Iranian-Arab 
contradictions are not completely settled. There is no certainty 
that it will be possible to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict 
conclusively and to general satisfaction. Afghanistan, for many 
of whose inhabitants war has become a way of life, demands 
pacification. The Pakistani-Indian disputes over Jammu and 
Kashmir are not subsiding. Chinese Xinjiang is beginning to boil 
over. The list could easily be continued. 
  Thus in the event of Russia's aggressive participation in 
NATO activity, it would face the threat of involvement in a 
whole series of conflicts in the South. Some of them would 
detonate in Russia itself. The time would come for "peacemaking 
operations" in Russia. The very existence of the Russian state 
could be in jeopardy. The "last push" to the South beneath the 
NATO pennant could be for Russia the last in its history 
altogether.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Leonid Ivashov by Colonel </F>
Nikolay Portnikov; place and date not given: "`We Are Bound by 
Deep Historical Roots': The CIS Military Cooperation 
Coordination Staff Has Its Own Plan of a Defensive Alliance 
Different From NATO's"] 
  [Text] Lieutenant General Leonid Grigoryevich Ivashov 
was born in 1943 in Kyrgyzia [Kyrgyzstan] to a worker's family. 
After high school graduation, a military school officer 
candidate, army service, and training at the M.V. Frunze 
Military Academy. He worked for a long time in the USSR Ministry 
of Defense central administrative offices and was head of its 
Administrative Department. A candidate of historical sciences 
and the author of scientific works. In May 1992 he was 
unanimously elected secretary of the Council of Defense 
Ministers of Commonwealth states. 
  [Plotnikov] Leonid Grigoryevich, in the opinion of certain 
political scientists, military experts, and journalists, the 
military cooperation of the Commonwealth states is at an 
impasse. How far does this viewpoint correspond to reality? 
  [Ivashov] Despite the fact that there really are many 
difficulties, I would not speak talk about an impasse situation. 
Everyone has now recognized that no Commonwealth state will 
create modern armed forces and a dependable system of national 
military security by itself. Either a pooling of efforts in the 
field of military organizational development or a lengthy period 
of waiting for the level of economic development of our states 
to permit the appropriation of sufficient funds for the needs of 
the army are needed for this. But this period would, I 
emphasize, be very long. In any event, even were the second path 
to be taken, integration in the military-technical sphere would 
be required. 
  A sober estimation of the situation that has been shaping up 
has recently been nudging the military-political leadership of 
the Commonwealth states in the direction of the need for greater 
integration not only in the economic but in the military sphere 
also. What, therefore, was unacceptable a year ago, when many 
people did not even allow of the idea of the formation of some 
new alliances and of the creation of real, not sham, joint armed 
forces, is today being spoken of insistently by many defense 
ministers, of Russia--General of the Army Pavel Sergeyevich 
Grachev--included. 
  It should be observed that the creation both of the 
defensive 
alliance and its main component--the Joint Armed Forces--is a 
lengthy process. Calculations have shown that it will take no 
fewer than two or three years. A political decision of the heads 
of state and the supreme legislative bodies, with recognition in 
this unifying process of the lead role of Russia, is, naturally, 
essential for this first and foremost. The latter by no means 
signifies attempts at the infringement of the sovereignty of any 
participant in the Commonwealth or a revival of imperial 
ambitions. Whether some people like it or not, historically, on 
account of many objective factors, it is Russia that has been 
and will continue to be the pivot and a kind of connecting link 
of a unified defense space on the territory of the former USSR. 
  [Plotnikov] And what factors, in your opinion, explain the 
need for the reconstitution of the unified defense space? 
  [Ivashov] There are many such factors. But three main ones, 
I 
would say. 
  First, the troop groupings and all the defense systems (air 
defense, ABM defenses, command and control and communications, 
and others) were for decades created on the basis of the 
interests of the military security of a unified territory. The 
common system of operational-strategic planning, the provision 
of the troops and naval forces with equipment, and specialist 
training was structured in just the same way. The military 
infrastructure developed on the basis of common interests. The 
disruption of this intricate organism, connected by thousands of 
threads, did considerable, if not to say immense, damage to the 
military security of each state of the Commonwealth and has had 
a serious effect on the combat readiness of all the national 
armies without exception. 
  Second, the economic factor. The profound integration of the 
republics in the sphere of military production developed and a 
single research, development, testing, and engineering took 
shape and functioned successfully over decades. More than 70 
head enterprises of industry and research institutions of all 
states of the Commonwealth and the Baltic countries worked on 
the strategic nuclear force. No republic, except for Russia, has 
its own military-industrial base capable of independently 
manufacturing the final models of arms and military equipment. 
  And, third, the moral factor. For several centuries our 
peoples lived in a unified country. Whether some people like it 
or not, we are bound by deep historical roots. The majority of 
us, therefore, cannot be reconciled to the appearance of borders 
and the severance of family and friendly ties. Is it normal when 
the dream of a young man from Kyrgyzia or Uzbekistan, say, to 
join the Navy cannot come true? Many people are deprived of this 
opportunity at this time. Did the state lose anything when 
military service was performed by young men of different 
nationalities? People's trust strengthened, mutual understanding 
emerged. 
  The officer corps, initially of the Russian, then of the 
Soviet, Army, was historically international. Representatives of 
over 100 nationalities and national groups were serving as 
regulars on 1 January 1992. Aside from the indigenous peoples of 
the 15 Union republics, there were 1,600 Poles, 1,300 Germans, 
560 Koreans, 440 Bulgarians, 250 Greeks, 50 Finns, and 25 Czechs 
in officer, general, and admiral ranks. There were even 
representatives of so ancient a people as the Assyrians. 
  [Plotnikov] Which states of the Commonwealth, aside from 
Russia, are advocating the creation of a new defensive alliance? 
  [Ivashov] From day one this idea has been supported 
consistently by Kazakhstan and President Nursultan Abishevich 
Nazarbayev personally. The military-political leadership of 
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzia, Tajikistan, and Armenia advocate active 
integration in the military sphere and the creation of joint 
armed forces. There are similar sentiments in a number of other 
states of the Commonwealth also. 
  [Plotnikov] Following the statement of the minister of 
defense of Russia concerning the need for the creation of 
Commonwealth joint armed forces, skeptical words were said in 
some news media about the reconstitution of a new, Warsaw 
Pact-type joint armed forces.... 
  [Ivashov] All that was best in the Warsaw Pact needs to be 
adopted, in respect to the creation of joint armed forces also. 
The experience that was generated cannot be denied. For together 
with the shortcomings there was much that was useful also. No 
one intends to copy things in full. The military-political 
situation in the world has changed, and enormous geopolitical 
changes have occurred on the territory of the former USSR. The 
Warsaw Pact was a European defensive community, and it was 
opposed by a specific enemy in the shape of NATO. The present 
community is to be a defensive alliance of Eurasian countries. 
Its main thrust is not against some external enemy but primarily 
the defense of the national interests of each participant and 
the Commonwealth as a whole. Each state has national-state 
interests, and any self-respecting country will unswervingly 
defend them. In addition, the tasks of the alliance are to be 
the stabilization of relations within the Commonwealth itself 
and the elimination of the current focal points of tension. 
  [Plotnikov] Nonetheless, the creation of a defensive 
alliance 
and joint armed forces are things of the future. There is 
currently the Military Cooperation Coordination Staff. Is such a 
body necessary or not? 
  [Ivashov] Merely the fact that the representatives of nine 
republics are working at the level of deputy chiefs of staff and 
that the specialist positions are manned on a coalition basis 
says a great deal. Were the states of the Commonwealth not 
interested in this body, the leaders of our countries would not 
at the last meeting have commissioned the elaboration of plans 
to extend cooperation, in the military sphere included. 
  It is contemplated that the adoption of a concept of 
collective security, which will be of a doctrinal character in 
nature, will be one of the first measures of this plan. In other 
words, this will be a kind of military doctrine of the 
subscribers to the Tashkent Treaty. 
  The next document will be devoted to a refinement of the 
principles of military cooperation. It is contemplated 
instituting several levels of military cooperation. It will be 
realized to a fuller extent within the framework of the Tashkent 
Treaty. The first--a kind of allied relations level. The 
second--the level of cooperation with states of the CIS that 
have not signed the Tashkent Treaty. And the third 
level--cooperation with states of the far abroad. 
  [Plotnikov] Are the Baltic countries displaying an interest 
in interaction in the military sphere with states of the 
Commonwealth? 
  [Ivashov] There have been no active steps as yet. But I am 
sure that this process will begin sooner or later, for all that. 
The last two years have shown that political populism is one 
thing, real life, quite another. We republics of the former 
Soviet Union need only ourselves and one another. The rest have 
an interest in us of an entirely different sort. Politicians 
should think about the future of their children and 
grandchildren. What have we left them, how will they live in the 
next millennium? Destroying things requires no great 
intellect.... 
  [Plotnikov] How is the Military Cooperation Coordination 
Staff's interaction with other CIS structures shaping up? 
  [Ivashov] We maintain the closest contacts with the CIS 
Executive Secretariat in Minsk. Its secretary, Ivan Mikhaylovich 
Korotchenya, regularly takes part in sessions of the Defense 
Ministers Council. Our representative, Major General Volkov, 
works in Minsk on a permanent basis. 
  The staff has good working contacts with the 
Interparliamentary Assembly and with the Foreign Ministers 
Council. The most important military-political questions have 
been discussed repeatedly at joint sessions of the Defense 
Ministers Council and the Foreign Ministers Council, 
incidentally. 
  [Plotnikov] You recently took part, as a member of a staff 
delegation, in NATO's Military Committee. The question of the 
possible affiliation of Commonwealth states to the Partnership 
for Peace program was discussed, inter alia.... 
  [Ivashov] I would like to mention first and foremost that 
quite serious attention was paid to our delegation. The speeches 
of the head of the delegation, Colonel General Samsonov, chief 
of the CIS Military Cooperation Coordination Staff, attracted 
great attention. We were convinced once again that mutual 
cooperation is essential. Everyone benefits from this. As far as 
the affiliation of Russia and the other states of the 
Commonwealth to NATO's partnership program is concerned, too 
much attention is being paid to this question, in my opinion. We 
have other, more important problems, that have to be resolved. 
  Without rejecting the idea of the Partnership for Peace 
program or the participation of the CIS states in this process, 
it is necessary in principle to give the creation of our own, 
Eurasian, system of collective security priority. Viktor 
Nikolayevich Samsonov proposed a version of cooperation between 
the two defensive alliances according to the 16+9 formula, which 
had been formulated by the staff, coordinated at the last 
session of the Defense Ministers Council, and initialed by eight 
ministers. We believe that this would be more effective in the 
interests of the maintenance of a stable military-political 
atmosphere in the world and the defense of the national-state 
interests of Russia and the other states of the Commonwealth.

<F P=106> [Article under "Foreign Policy" rubric by Yevgeniy Silin, </F>
director-coordinator of the Association for Euro-Atlantic 
Cooperation: "Partnership for Peace in an Apocalyptic Light. 
Cooperation Is Not Determined by One of the Parties"] 
  [Text] Discussions 
  "Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace may 
critically destabilize the situation on the southern flanks," 
warns Doctor of Philosophical Sciences Aleksandr Ignatenko in 
the 13 May issue of SEGODNYA. 
  It could, we agree with him, if the country and its 
leadership follow all the author's assumptions, making Russia's 
future look completely hopeless or even fatal. Fortunately, I 
think we can avoid such a fate if we note the excessive weight 
of schematic determinism in the very method of approaching this 
acute and urgent problem, not only on the part of the author of 
the aforementioned article, but of quite a few investigators of 
the subject as well. 
  According to A. A. Ignatenko's version, in order to "doom 
Russia" it must itself get involved in realizing several of the 
author's assumptions, which, he is sure, will certainly happen 
if our country accedes to the "notorious" program. 
  Ignatenko considers that "The inclusion in Atlantic 
structures of Russia, as well as all the other parts of the once 
great Euro-Asian state--the Soviet Union, will lead to the 
appearance of a global military-political bloc of nations of the 
'North' (Northern Hemisphere)." And since Russia, unlike its 
potential partners in the NATO program, is in direct, immediate 
contact with the "South," with its extremely high-conflict 
zones, NATO will burden our country with the unenvious role of 
pacifier of the "South," for which it (Russia) will pay the 
price of its demise. The reality of such a course of events is 
borne out, in the author's view, by the vital interests of the 
NATO countries themselves, some trends in Russian policy, and 
certain schemes of its military and political leaders. 
  On the whole, there is nothing wrong with such warnings, and 
it is good that the Russian public is given timely notice of the 
possible dangers of partnership, if we embark on it with no one 
knows whom and no one knows why. If the content of the 
partnership is defined by one side, not by us, and according to 
the worse possible scenario for us. But that is far from being 
the case. With its Partnership for Peace project NATO is 
extending Russia a hand with a specific proposal that meets our 
own wishes not to take hasty steps to expand the organization to 
the East and not, thereby, isolate Russia in Europe. 
  Judging by things, on the whole the framework, i.e., most 
general, agreement on the Partnership meets such wishes. The 
specific commitments of Russia and NATO under the program are 
still to be thoroughly worked out and, it must be hoped, the 
common sense of both sides will not permit landing in a 
situation detrimental to Russia's national interests. Moreover, 
these interests can hardly be subordinated to a single reference 
frame, a single geopolitical axis or paradigm. It is obvious 
that for Russians "North"-"South" relations are no less 
important than West-East relations. The very Eurasian nature of 
our country requires the establishment of harmonious relations 
of cooperation and interaction for peaceful purposes in all 
geopolitical directions and along all conceivable axes. The 
global character of international intercourse and formidable 
challenges to all humanity have only strengthened the need to 
take into account the interdependence of problems of Russian 
foreign policy in every direction. 
  Getting back to the "extended hand" metaphor, I hasten to 
respond to those who question the intentions of the party 
extending that hand. In politics realists should, of course, 
voice healthy doubts, but they should verify their doubts 
against their own actions. Only in the 20th century our country 
experienced for itself the negative consequences of the "empty 
chair" tactics and a priori rejection of projects and programs 
from which others certainly benefited. One need but recall our 
nonparticipation in the work of the UN Security Council when it 
was debating the Korean question or our refusal to take part in 
the Marshall Plan. 
  We cannot guarantee that all of those in NATO who put 
forward 
and supported the Partnership for Peace idea did so solely out 
of altruistic or Russophile considerations. More likely than not 
they are guided by their own interests, however understood, but 
their own. However, NATO's will and actions in this, as well as 
other, questions represent a certain balance of different 
interests of the countries comprising the alliance. At times 
nuances in the motivations behind the actions of individual NATO 
countries and politicians vary significantly. It is the duty of 
our own foreign policy makers to carefully weigh this diversity 
and inject our own interests into the common behavior patterns 
of the participants in partnership relations, whatever form they 
may take. 
  So far, reasoning according to the logic of the author of 
the 
reviewed article, we can only add one assumption: whether, in 
the absence of Russia, the NATO countries might not give the 
role of pacifiers of the "South" to the former republics of the 
USSR in Transcaucasia and Central Asia which have already joined 
or are hastening to join the Partnership program. That is, of 
course, an entirely speculative assumption. But are not 
prophesies of the threat of worsening Russian-Chinese or 
Russian-Muslim relations if Russia becomes a member of the 
Partnership as speculative? Warnings about the loss of markets 
for our military-industrial complex [MIC] and other troubles 
should, apparently, be viewed in the same light. 
  The conference, "Russia and NATO: Security in the 
Euro-Atlantic Region," sponsored recently in Moscow by the 
Euro-Atlantic Cooperation Association, demonstrated the 
artificial character of a priori rejection of the proposal. As 
Western participants in the conference told us, one of the main 
conclusions they drew for themselves was that some Russian 
politicians rejected the Partnership idea out of hand not 
because of any organic flaws discovered in the program, but by 
virtue of the urge to come out in opposition to official policy 
on any issue. 
  Naturally, members of parliament, political parties, 
scholars, the press, and society as a whole, are entitled and 
duty bound to critically appraise the actions of official 
circles in the international arena, especially if they are 
imprudent, contradictory or, occasionally, unreasonably 
far-fetched. However, it appears that with regard to the problem 
we are debating the official policy promoters managed to display 
a healthy degree of caution and find forms of expressing 
specifically Russian interests, the interests of a great 
Eurasian power, a bridge between West and East, a major 
influential force of the CIS, a connecting link in the unified 
defense space on the territory of the former USSR. 
  It should be noted, and the aforementioned conference once 
again confirmed, that official Russian politicians are 
considering possible (and in some cases already implemented) 
partnership relations with NATO precisely with due consideration 
of our interests in interaction with the entire world, along all 
lines; that in Europe, too, we view the role of NATO and 
associated formations in the context of European countries' 
participation in the activities of the United Nations and the 
CSCE. The buildup of practical forms of relations between NATO 
itself and those organizations, of which Russia is an equal 
member, is the earnest of the promise of the Partnership program. 
  Incidentally, specific consideration of proposed forms of 
partnership in this program is an indication of the reasonable 
modesty of the initial proposals, whereas the ill-conceived 
issue regarding the standardization of weapons, with imminent 
difficulties for our MIC, is, in the eyes of many scholarly 
Russian experts, on the contrary, more an opportunity for 
overcoming political and technical barriers to the opening of 
foreign markets to all that is of value which our industry can 
still produce. 
  In short, common sense with a necessary degree of prudence 
does not, in our view, permit offhand dismissal of the 
Partnership for Peace program, insofar as we have not yet 
overcome the dearth of confidence in East-West relations, have 
not yet done away with all vestiges of the Cold War, while our 
current economic and domestic difficulties leave no place for 
negative attitudes towards positive sprouts of the desired 
harmony in European and world affairs. It is another matter not 
to permit exploitation of our difficulties, which is just what 
exponents of Russophobic ideas in both the West and the East who 
have rushed in to replace anticommunism since the target of 
their hate has ceased to be a source of real military threat, 
are striving to do. 
  It is all the more necessary for Russia not to miss the 
chance to enhance confidence towards itself in the eyes of close 
and distant neighbors in both West and East, to help find a 
mutually acceptable variant of cooperation between two defense 
communities, NATO and the CIS, even if the former is at the apex 
of its influence and effectiveness while the latter is just 
taking its first steps towards establishing itself. It is 
important to launch a mechanism for coordinating the reciprocal 
interests and programs of Russia, NATO and the CIS. 
  All too often a position of haughty contempt coupled with 
blind distrust of other parties in international relations has 
served our country ill. In our view, it is precisely on such 
soil that apocalyptic pictures of Russian downfall could acquire 
real, but totally unwanted, features.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Viktor Kremenyuk, deputy director of </F>
the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of the USA and Canada, 
under the heading "Criticism": "The Start of a Long Road: Is a 
Partnership Between Russia and the West Realistic?"] 
  [Text] A number of questions were discussed during 
the Russian president's visit to Germany in May. But it appears 
that the main purpose of the visit was something else 
altogether: to find out how seriously the FRG and the West as a 
whole are about partnership with Russia. Are they not tending, 
concealed by declarations of "partnership," to place Russia in 
the dependent position of a "junior partner" and thereby cement 
their "victory" in the Cold War? These issues have been the 
subject of public discussion. 
  In January of this year, during a meeting in Moscow, 
presidents Yeltsin and Clinton asserted "that relations between 
Russia and the United States have entered a new stage of mature 
strategic partnership, mutual benefit and recognition of each 
other's national interests." However, the overall evolution of 
relations between Russia and the United States and other Western 
countries -- most importantly, practical steps in the field of 
mutual relations -- indicates that the actual state of those 
relations is very far from a "partnership" as that term is 
understood in international usage. In fact, the West has 
undertaken a number of actions -- from the bombing of Serbian 
positions in Bosnia over Russia's objections, to the humiliating 
refusal to invite Russia to attend the 50th anniversary of the 
opening of a "second front" in Europe -- which cannot be 
interpreted as anything except an attempt to "put Russia in its 
place." 
  Correspondingly, there is no way that relations between 
Russia and the West can achieve the balance, the optimum 
formula, that would calm politicians on both sides and would 
correspond to their objective needs. And it is unlikely that 
empty talk about "partnership" will help matters any. What are 
needed are practical actions that will in fact lead to an equal 
partnership (if such a thing is possible), or else Russia's 
relations with the West will continue to be characterized by 
nervousness and unpredictability. 
  Therefore, so as not to mislead the public and the decision 
makers, it would be advisable to think about just how justified 
it is at the present stage to speak of partnership as an 
accomplished fact in Russia's relations with the West, or 
whether this is still just a cherished dream that is very far 
from being a reality. 
<H5>  There Is `Partnership,' Then There Is `Partnership' </H5>
  The Americans first began seriously talking about 
"partnership" as one of the key principles of their foreign 
policy under President Nixon in the late 1960's. The failure of 
aggression in Vietnam, the accompanying acute domestic crisis in 
the United States and disarray in political circles all forced 
Washington to stop regarding its allies as "junior partners" and 
attempt to fashion a system of relations with them based on the 
principles of partnership. 
  Thereupon followed years of intensive efforts to find the 
most adequate forms of partnership, including active efforts by 
the Trilateral Commission, which in the 1970's prepared 
documents on all the main issues in international relations, 
with consideration for the interests of the United States, 
Western Europe and Japan, and meetings of the Big Seven 
countries beginning in1975, though as a rule these took place 
without a great deal of commotion or public notice. On the 
whole, one must honestly admit that while the countries of the 
"socialist commonwealth" were unswervingly heading for the 
collapse of that commonwealth, in the 1970's and 1980's the Big 
Seven countries were, on the contrary, moving toward a higher 
level of cooperation and consolidation. 
  Russia has virtually no experience establishing that kind of 
relations. Therefore there is little reason to expect that it 
can immediately, within a few years' time, wade through the mass 
of obstacles that objectively stand between Russia and 
partnership with the leading Western states. One will be able to 
speak of real "partnership" when a solid foundation for it 
exists in the form of a mutual stake in economic relations and 
closeness or similarity in the social base and political 
structure of and cooperation among kindred parties of a 
democratic, Christian or liberal orientation. When, finally, 
governing circles have similar or comparable social experience. 
  There is not even a hint of these things in Russia's 
relations with the West today, and it will take years (if our 
country develops successfully) for them to begin to appear. 
<H5>  The Foundations of a Possible `Partnership' </H5>
  If one were to attempt to assess prospects for a partnership 
between Russia and the leading Western countries, in particular 
with the United States, first of all one must acknowledge the 
marked inequality or asymmetry in the two sides' position. 
  Following the end of the Cold War the United States lost 
virtually nothing in terms of its international standing. It 
remains the largest nuclear superpower, its military and 
political blocs have not collapsed, and it continues to play the 
role of the largest provider of aid to other countries. The U.S. 
economy, though experiencing some difficulties, is nevertheless 
successfully weathering a technotronic era, assuming positions 
of leadership in virtually every advanced technology. The United 
States remains a country with one of the highest per capita 
incomes and well-developed health care, social security and 
educational systems. The same can be said of the FRG, Great 
Britain, Japan and other Western countries. Without idealizing 
their situation, in which problems do exist, one must 
nevertheless admit that the West is a wealthy and developed 
society with good prospects for the 21st century. 
  Russia comes up looking badly by comparison. The USSR has 
collapsed, but virtually no one except the elites of the new 
republics gained by that, with the possible exception of the 
Baltic countries. As the largest country in the former Soviet 
Union, Russia inherited its military status and its role as a 
great power. But its economy is in deep crisis, a majority of 
the population is barely making ends meet, and over 35 percent 
of the population (according to various estimates) are living on 
the verge of poverty. The country is characterized by 
instability, and institutions of government are fighting among 
themselves, unable to propose either a socioeconomic future that 
is acceptable to the majority or, at the very least, a tolerable 
existence. The center and the regions are in a state of constant 
competition, and ethnic minorities are rebelling. A country that 
has the potential to be the richest in the world is in a state 
of semi-collapse. 
  It is clear that in this situation there is only one point 
for Russia to a "partnership" with the West: obtaining a source 
of funding, technology and know-how to rescue its economy from 
crisis. Consequently, from the very start the West regards it as 
a burden on the West's quite frankly somewhat limited available 
resources, because the United States, Germany and other 
seemingly "rich" countries themselves require loans and credits 
to maintain production. Even prosperous Germany is having 
increasing difficulty coming up with foreign aid funds as it 
spends approximately $100 billion annually on reconstruction of 
the former GDR. 
  What does Russia have to offer in exchange? Vague promises 
of 
future income from Russian mineral resources? Equally vague 
promises to open up its capital investment market to foreign 
corporations? It is hard to imagine that this is an adequate 
attraction to the West, which is very well aware that even 
Russian entrepreneurs, though secretly and illegally, are taking 
their own capital out of the country, and that with current 
taxes and laws and the reign of the bureaucracy only a madman 
would risk investing his own money. These concerns increase in 
proportion to Russia's internal instability: what if 
Zhirinovskiy comes to power? Or the communists? What then? 
  The only thing that Russia can offer as an adequate 
contribution to a "partnership" is cooperation in the area of 
arms control and resolution of international crises. In that 
regard one must admit that the real partnership that emerged in 
relations between the USSR and the United States in the course 
of profound changes in the international arena (this 
"partnership" was first mentioned by President Bush during a 
meeting with CPSU Central Committee General Secretary M. S. 
Gorbachev in Malta in December 1989) could serve as a serious 
foundation upon which both powers could build broader and more 
lasting partnership relations. 
  Subsequently events took their course: at the end of 1991 
the 
Soviet Union collapsed, and the United States was skeptical of 
Russia's attempts to replace it as a "partner." This did not 
prevent the United States from signing the START II Treaty with 
Russia. But that was most likely due to inertia from previous 
years, because the treaty left out Ukraine, Belorussia and 
Kazakhstan, which were also nuclear heirs of the USSR. 
  As for crises and examples of cooperation with regard to 
resolving them, the Americans are increasingly disinclined to 
trust the Russian Government, which is definitely not always 
prepared to risk unpopular decisions (for example, supporting 
the West's anti-Serbian course in Yugoslavia) and at times is 
incapable of defining a given region's degree of importance to 
Russia. 
  "Partnership" between Russia and the West, if it were 
actually to begin functioning now, would most likely mean a 
tremendous inequality between the partners, an inequality that 
would become increasingly difficult to correct with the passage 
of time. 
  A weak Russia that has lost its traditional image and has an 
inefficient economy cannot be an equal partner for the United 
States or the European Union. It will continue to ask for loans 
and extension of its debt repayment schedule. Gradually there 
will emerge (or perhaps already has emerged) between it and the 
West a dense network of dependency that will ensnare the 
country, its resources, its policy and even its culture. That is 
what must be avoided at all costs. We must resolutely focus 
primarily on fixing the economy, without pinning any particular 
hopes on anyone curing our ills for us. 
  We should be oriented toward a partnership with the West, 
but 
only in some distant future. Entering into one now would be to 
risk the free future of our nation. 
<H5>  The Convergence Has Begun </H5>
  Despite all these seemingly obvious facts, the Russian 
Government has set itself the task of rapidly building 
"partnership" relations with the West. As a rule, the response 
it gets consists of polite ambiguities, vague sentiments and, at 
the same time, some rather harsh demands. Moreover, those 
demands apply to the realms of politics, economics, security and 
even, in a number of cases, internal affairs. Very often those 
demands give absolutely no consideration to Russia's specific 
circumstances, and can even take the form of dictates. 
  One can imagine that Western politicians have too thoroughly 
perceived the "smiling diplomacy" of the Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs as evidence of Russia's willingness, like a 
wayward schoolboy, to listen to lectures and commentary in hopes 
of some unspecified reward in the future. Even in a matter in 
which Russians could well take pride -- the overthrow of the 
communist regime -- there has been the usual expression of 
gratitude to the West for its "energetic efforts," even though 
it is a well-known fact that after the end of the war in Vietnam 
the West renounced "crusades" and was prepared to cooperate with 
the communist Soviet Union or China, if that was in line with 
its own needs. 
  The initial and quite naive attempts to depict Russia as 
virtually a ready-made "partner" for the West have given rise to 
a very incorrect reaction there. There people often forget that 
Russia, despite all its internal weakness, was and still remains 
a great power. There people have dared to flagrantly interfere 
in Russia's internal affairs in the Baltic countries and in 
Russia's relations with the CIS countries. There people have 
deemed it possible to reproach Russians over Zhirinovskiy both 
publicly and on an official level in a way that would be 
unthinkable if the subject were any Western politician (for 
example, publicly ridicule of the eccentric American millionaire 
Ross Perot during the presidential campaign). 
  Western dictates have taken particularly ugly forms in the 
area of Russian economic reforms. Threatened with the cutoff of 
loans or refusal to extend debt repayment, Ye. Gaydar's 
government was forced to take measures that had not been 
prepared, worked out in detail, carefully considered or 
discussed in public. Of course, Gaydar was not just a passive 
observer; he, too, had a burning desire to create a market 
economy in Russia as quickly as possible. But one would like to 
think that he did realize how many objective social, political 
and cultural obstacles there were to accomplishing that. And he 
probably realized that without painstaking preparatory work that 
could provide at least a minimal political base for reforms they 
should not be adopted. 
  There are plenty of examples of Western high-handedness in 
dealings with Russia. They include the cancelled rocket engine 
deal between Russia and India, attempts to restrict the Russian 
arms trade, slowness in repealing formal bans and restrictions 
on trade, an obvious unwillingness to accept Russia as a member 
of the Council of Europe, and many more. Among the latest acts 
of a hostile nature toward Russia one could cite the infamous 
NATO plan called "Partnership for Peace" and the bombing of 
Serbian positions in Bosnia carried out by NATO aircraft. 
  One gets the impression that the nascent convergence between 
Russia and the West, in which "smiling diplomacy" played such a 
visible role during the first stage, has produced some not very 
positive results. The foundation without which partnership is 
impossible -- mutual respect for each side's legitimate 
interests -- has not been laid down. The West was happy to 
believe A. Kozyrev when he claimed that Russia does not have any 
special, "private" interests, and concluded that it could impose 
its own "values" and "ideals" on Russia as a guide to 
understanding of what Russia should do in the international 
arena. 
  These thoughts are brought to mind by the bombing of Serbian 
positions in Bosnia. It should be noted that on the whole the 
NATO "initiative," which arbitrarily declares former Yugoslavia 
a zone under its "responsibility" (unaligned Yugoslavia never 
was such) and offers its services to the U.N. as a "peacemaker," 
evokes the strongest reservations. 
  Simple logic says that this military and political bloc, a 
creation of the Cold War, should follow the Warsaw Pact's 
example and dissolve itself, as there is no real threat of a 
major war in Europe. U.N. forces are fully capable of monitoring 
the conflicts that do occur in Europe, such as the Yugoslavian 
conflict, and there is no need to assemble huge air armadas to 
resolve them. The very idea that air strikes could be used to 
put an end to a highly complex ethnic conflict with a tragic 
history is simply beneath serious politicians. 
  Nevertheless, despite the vigorous objections of Russia, 
which has its own interests in the region, the NATO air strikes 
were carried out. In effect Russia's interests were publicly 
ignored, and no one even remembered to consult her president. 
  All the doubts that have been expressed about "partnership" 
with the West should not be interpreted as a rejection of its 
value for the international system in general and for Russia in 
particular. "Partnership" has become a fairly good form of 
mutual relations between groups of countries and ensures that 
balance is maintained between their interests. Russia also needs 
"partnership," but only the kind of partnership in which it 
respects other countries' legitimate interests without any harm 
to its own legitimate interests. 
  Then Russia's entry into the world community would not 
destabilize that community, but rather would markedly strengthen 
it. However, in order to achieve that level of relations both 
Russia and the United States, as well as all of our country's 
other possible partners, still have a long road to travel. And 
that road begins in Russia, not in the West. It is only possible 
to build partnership relations with other countries if we have a 
healthy economy, a transparent process for the development of 
foreign policy, a strong system of democratic institutions and a 
clear and unambiguous image of our country in the rest of the 
world.

"Impressions": "The Balkan War Through the Eyes of Amateurs: 
Russian Members of Parliament Take Lessons in Diplomacy in the 
Zone of the Yugoslav Crisis"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Mandate </H5>
  Belgrade-Pale-Sarajevo-Vukovar-Moscow--As far as I could see 
in accompanying a delegation of the State Duma on a tour of the 
region of the Balkan crisis on the last days of April, Russian 
members of parliament make only middling diplomats. Their trip 
proved odd, to say the least. And the participants in the 
journey themselves also appeared, from the viewpoint of their 
partners in the former Yugoslav republics, odd. 
  These oddities were predetermined, most likely, by the Duma 
itself. All the complaints should be laid at its door. This was 
altogether quite a priceless decision: to choose a moment when 
the protracted civil war was experiencing one of the most 
drastic exacerbations of bloody animosity throughout its history 
and to dispatch a group of deputies directly to the zone of the 
hostilities. To convince itself that the NATO command was not 
kidding in issuing the parties to the conflict one ultimatum 
after another, threatening to engage the entire colossal 
military machine--and to suggest to the members of parliament 
that they put in some practice at the art of shuttle diplomacy. 
Especially since professional diplomats of the highest skills 
had exactly the day before publicly declared that their patience 
was exhausted, confidence had been undermined, they no longer 
saw any point in efforts of this kind.... 
  The mandate extended by the lower house of the Russian 
parliament to the delegation of deputies to the Balkans was 
never recorded on paper. The mission was put together, as we 
recall, not simply in haste but in semi-hysterical fashion. The 
NATO bombing in the Goradze region, which had begun without 
full-fledged consultations with the Russian leadership, provoked 
one of the most bitter political rows experienced by the current 
corps of deputies. The row developed into a highly-strung and, 
as always in such cases, muddle-headed altercation at a plenary 
sitting. A decision was postponed--it not being entirely 
understood, meanwhile, of what it should, for that matter, 
consist--until the return of the "inspection," which was 
instructed "to meet with all the belligerents and ascertain 
everything on the spot." Only having closely studied the 
verbatim record of the debate is an approximate reconstruction 
of the meaning of this actual "everything" which was to be 
ascertained possible. 
  The deputies set out for Belgrade with, apparently, roughly 
the following assignment: 
  1) To ascertain the cause of the war going on there; 
  2) To ascertain who is guilty in this war and in what 
respect 
and who, consequently, is innocent; 
  3) To ascertain whether or not it is possible somehow to 
terminate this war; 
  4) To ascertain whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
Russia is behaving correctly there and whether it is 
communicating the truth in response to parliament's inquiries on 
the Yugoslav problem; 
  5) To ascertain separately what "UN sanctions against 
Yugoslavia" mean and whether we are doing right in supporting 
them, and if not, how we might cease our support for them and 
what this would mean for us; 
  6) As for the rest, on the small points, get your own 
bearings on the spot.... 
  Not bad for a first experiment in parliamentary diplomacy? 
  There was, after all, really nothing more specific on the 
deputies' "travel checklist." Inasmuch as there was, we repeat, 
no travel checklist. There were airline tickets to Sofia, 
expenses for seven days, two officials from the Duma 
administrative system for assistance, $3,500 for unforeseen 
group expenses, and a promise to call the Russian Embassy in 
Belgrade and request assistance. 
<H5>  Working Model of the State Duma 1/47th Its Natural Size </H5>
  The Duma sent nine amateurs on the far-reaching diplomatic 
expedition. The list, drawn up according to the "one 
faction--one representative" principle, was filled out with 
people, the absolute majority of whom were incidental. The 
considerations that guided the leaders of the factions in 
suggesting candidates for the trip are totally unclear. As the 
members of the delegation themselves acknowledged, one of them 
"thought about it a bit and asked in," another "had not been 
abroad for a long time," a third was "seated near the aisle in 
the hall and caught someone's eye at the wrong time." 
  This was the result: Major General Nikolay Bezborodov (in 
the 
recent past, chief of a flying school, from Kurgan), head of the 
delegation--Communist Party of the Russian Federation and, as 
ascertained on the spot, Russia's Way; Vladimir Averchev 
(counselor at the Embassy of the Russian Federation in the 
United States)--Yabloko; Mariya Gaydash (deputy chief of the 
administration, from Nizhniy)--Women of Russia; Grigoriy 
Dyudyayev (distinguished kolkhoz member, Kemerovo 
Oblast)--Agrarian Party of Russia; Konstantin Zatulin 
(entrepreneur, from Moscow)--Party of Russian Unity and Accord; 
Vyacheslav Marychev (director of a plant clubhouse, from 
Petersburg)--Liberal Democratic Party of Russia; Adrian 
Puzanovskiy (lecturer at an agricultural institute, from 
Kostroma)--New Regional Policy; Aleksey Sarychev (judge, from 
Barnaul)--Russia's Choice; Viktor Talanov ("not currently 
employed," nor is his place of residence indicated in the 
reference book)--Democratic Party of Russia. 
  Anything you like, only not a diplomatic mission.... 
  Only Vladimir Averchev has practical experience of foreign 
policy service: two years at the embassy in Washington under 
Vladimir Lukin plus work as an official of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee in the last parliament and membership of the same 
committee of the State Duma, as a deputy this time. He alone, it 
would seem, could in the situation that had come about in the 
Balkans as a result of the three-year war get his bearings 
relatively easily. A further two or three persons had, perhaps, 
some idea of the heart of the matter in general outline, if only 
at the level of daily newspaper reports. The rest, alas.... 
  It cannot be claimed that the delegation had not, prior to 
departure, received any briefing from the professionals. Vitaliy 
Churkin paid a visit to the Duma in the evening of the day 
before departure. Subsequently the deputies, stunned by the 
information that had been rained down on them all at once, 
paraphrased these instructions thus: "Churkin said: Convey to 
the Serbs that there will be no more games; convey to them that 
they will now be hit hard and that we will, finally, support the 
NATO people...." 
  The absolute majority of members of the delegation were 
learning for themselves at this moment, let us speak plainly, a 
tremendous amount of what was new and interesting, about which 
they had hitherto heard, at best, just something or other. That, 
for example, there are today on the map of the former 
Yugoslavia, apparently, a whole three Serbias: Serbia proper as 
part of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]; the Republic 
of Serb Krajina (RSK), which is cut in two and which occupies in 
toto approximately one-third of the territory of Croatia; the 
Serb Republic (RS), which controls approximately 64 percent of 
the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  They learned that all three Serbias are in a state of war 
with Croatia. But that in 1993 active hostilities around the RSK 
gradually subsided and that the front stabilized. There was an 
intensification, on the other hand, of the clashes between the 
Serb Republic and the Croats and Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
who relatively recently declared their readiness to form a 
federation and join Croatia in a "soft" confederative union. 
Nonetheless, even at its present stage the Balkan war continues 
to be considered tripartite. Two ethnic communities are 
essentially uniting against a third. 
  They learned that as of February 1992, when the UN Security 
Council voted to send to the Balkans the first "blue helmet" 
contingents, a fourth party to the drama--the UNPROFOR (SOONO in 
its Russian version) multinational force--appeared also. By the 
end of last year the personnel of the British, French, Canadian, 
Egyptian, Russian, Ukrainian, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, and 
other military units deployed here already totaled more than 
25,000. 
  Generally, only here was it ascertained that "all parties," 
whose arguments were to be heard, were not two ("Serbs" and 
"Muslims," as has traditionally been heard in all parliamentary 
debates and in the majority of reports supplied by the Foreign 
Ministry also) but a minimum of four. The time for learning 
everything about everything was, as before, a week. 
  An adventure, in short? Not at all, why so? More the 
traditional approach to matters: A rush job is announced, and it 
is proposed making up for the lack of time, lack of resources, 
lack of organization, lack of qualifications, for all that is 
missing, making good the shortage thanks to the enthusiasm and 
conscientiousness of the citizens. 
  Nor is it all that simple when it comes to conscientiousness 
either, for that matter. The idea akin to that of a 
jury--entrusting the function of arbiters to people whose view 
is free of preconceived notions and prejudices and whose 
perception of events is patently not overburdened by 
stratifications of secondary (and, consequently, inevitably 
distorted) information--would be elegant even. Were the 
potential arbiters truly impartial and prepared to renounce 
their customary affections and traditional taboos. If, in our 
case, they did not sympathize so ardently and sincerely with one 
of the sides. The Serbs, of course. 
  We should one day, probably, in a more tranquil atmosphere, 
try to ascertain why it came about that a 100 percent pro-Serb 
interpretation of the Yugoslav conflict became in Russia an 
obligatory attribute of a "serious, responsible policy," his own 
involvement in which any public figure concerned for his 
reputation considers himself duty bound to prove and defend. In 
the most general outline the heart of the matter is perfectly 
comprehensible: The December elections demonstrated the 
propaganda value and the "high profitableness" (in the sense of 
the return support of the electorate) of patriotic slogans. The 
upheaval caused by the success of the nationalist radicals of 
the LDPR provoked the almost instinctive reaction of democratic 
circles and, simultaneously, of the ruling Russian elite: "We 
will not cede our patriotism to all these riff-raff! We 
ourselves will be patriots also!" 
  But the proclamation of patriotic values as the core of 
Russia's domestic policy, which is attended by unpleasant 
national problems, is a troublesome, risky business. And should 
it come to be a question, say, of the policy of the Russian 
Federation in the former space of the Union, even costly also, 
in the direct, financial, and economic sense, inasmuch as it 
immediately creates additional obligations of the country to 
compatriots abroad. On the foreign policy market, on the other 
hand, "state patriotism" is proving to be a far more profitable 
commodity insofar as it does not, seemingly, require direct 
outlays, if only at the initial stage: The Slav peoples, 
Orthodoxy, historical fraternity, cultural kinship, similarity 
of national characters--all this comes, after all, free of 
charge, virtually.... The result: "Russia will never betray 
Serbia!..." 
  Whatever the case, the spectrum of opinions of the members 
of 
the Duma delegation to the Balkans corresponded precisely to the 
traditional apportionment of forces that is revealed each time 
that the chamber has by vote to define its attitude toward the 
latest resolution on the defense of human rights in the former 
Yugoslavia, international sanctions against the FRY, or the 
official policy of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.... 
Namely, all factions more or less unanimously express sympathy 
with the Serbian side, Choice vacillates, Yabloko tries to steer 
a middle course, and Women have no clear position. The Balkan 
mission was cause for the creation of a model of the State Duma 
of the Russian Federation 1/47th of its natural size. A working 
model, what is more. 
  One of the first Yugoslav leaders to receive the delegation 
in Belgrade--Zeljko Simic, deputy prime minister of the 
Government of the FRY--began the negotiations with words to the 
effect that "the Russian parliament is the unique political 
institution that has never been seen to be adopting a one-sided, 
partial interpretation of the role of party to the conflict." A 
statement that is extraordinarily flattering, of course, but 
very far from the truth. And Mr. Simic, who has the reputation 
of a rising star of Serbian politics: Although young, he is 
already a resourceful, subtle, and very well-informed tactician, 
could not have failed to have understood that seated in front of 
him were people of whom two or three, perhaps, would abstain, 
had they to vote for any resolution in support of Serbia, the 
rest, however, would assuredly vote "aye." 
<H5>  Professionalism for Nonprofessionals </H5>
  The "model" did not resemble the full-scale version of the 
Duma in just one respect, perhaps: It was far more likable--in 
purely human terms. 
  Counting the road across the Bulgarian border to Belgrade 
and 
back, the parliamentary expedition covered in a week almost 
2,000 km by bus and motor vehicle. For nine adult people, who 
were barely acquainted with one another prior to this and who 
were, by definition, different (if we are speaking of their 
philosophy, temperament, experience of life, and "pre-deputy" 
social position, finally), this was a difficult assignment: hour 
after hour--together. 
  The training for compatibility, for "harmonizability," as 
vivisectionists from some institute for medical and biological 
problems would say, in itself appeared unusually instructive. 
There arose in the detached observer (like the author of these 
notes, who traveled the whole route with the delegation) from 
time to time all kinds of radiant illusions as regards the fact 
that it is on such trips that the foundations may most naturally 
be laid for the mutual understanding and mutual respect of even 
irreconcilable political adversaries and that a proper and even 
benevolent style of parliamentary relations may be cultivated. I 
began to feel at times: To hell with it, Yugoslavia, however 
this trip might end, it will produce a far-reaching result--nine 
persons capable of reaching an understanding on whatever you 
like will appear in the Duma. A kind of super-effective 
conciliation commission. Normal people, really, it is obvious. 
And selected in purely accidental fashion. Perhaps the rest 
could be sent to a hellhole somewhere in the same way--in small 
groups. And then you could get laws adopted.... 
  Whiling away the journey, the deputies were able to exchange 
barbs good-naturedly and astonishingly wittily for hours on the 
most risky political grounds. They could guffaw at the 
embarrassed and frightened emissary of the liberal democrats, 
who had injudiciously blurted out--literally--that "the LDPR was 
altogether a party of madmen." They could suddenly yield to a 
sentimental impulse and, despite interfactional disagreements, 
set off to lay flowers on the grave of Rodzyanko at the old 
Belgrade cemetery. The communist Bezborodov could suddenly on a 
nighttime bus ride break remarkably tunefully and with great 
feeling into "The morning paints with gentle light...," and the 
democrat Sarychev, join in as best he could. 
  But the entire idyll falls apart instantly as soon as a 
television camera or microphone appears in the members of 
parliament's field of vision. The deputy Marychev, with eyes 
glazed with commitment and zeal, immediately began to convey to 
the Serb community "the position of the Liberal Democratic Party 
and its chairman, Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, personally." 
The deputy Dyudyayev, writhing in a cruel grip, gave himself 
over to inarticulate imprecations against the "aggressive policy 
of the NATO bloc and the pro-American position of the Russian 
leadership".... 
  It was with good reason, for that matter, that we employed 
somewhat earlier the word "conscientiousness." For the Russian 
deputies this is, apparently, a monstrously loose concept. And 
it could be seen repeatedly that, aside from the experience and 
practice of diplomatic work (which to an almost equal extent was 
catastrophically lacking in all the participants in the 
delegation), the success of such a mission largely depends on 
some base qualities essential to the member of parliament. I am 
talking about political professionalism, in the most general 
sense of the word. And, specifically, about receptivity to a 
large volume of new information and about the ability to analyze 
it promptly and dispassionately. About the capacity for looking, 
and seeing. Listening, and hearing. 
  General Bezborodov, leader of the delegation, comported 
himself with exceptional dignity in this respect. There is no 
doubt with which side his sympathies lay. But for some reason or 
other he considered himself duty bound time after time to take 
it upon himself to drum into his colleagues who had overstepped 
all bounds at the negotiations not proper behavior exactly, but 
simple decency: The delegation has been sent by the State Duma 
to the conflict zone by no means to express solidarity with 
anyone at all or to approve of some people or other here but to 
hold some people up to shame for something or other. "No one 
ever entrusted the role of judge to our delegation," he declared 
at a meeting with a leader of Serbia. "Time alone will be your 
judge. We are interested merely in presenting to the Duma the 
fullest possible information necessary for a balanced decision." 
And whatever singes the heart of the convinced communist, the 
deputy Bezborodov gave no one cause to rebuke him for partiality. 
  But the head of the delegation's ideas as to what, in fact, 
should constitute the dignity of a member of parliament of a 
great power who has suddenly--and involuntarily almost--found 
himself a diplomat were not shared by many. We will name 
Averchev, Gaydash, Zatulin, and Sarychev here. The others were 
regularly and irrepressibly carried away. 
  Adrian Puzanovskiy, for instance, considered it entirely 
appropriate to proclaim in the middle of the negotiations with 
the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs in Pale: "We have come to 
support the Serbian people in their just struggle and want to 
know only how we may be of further assistance to them...." So 
this, apparently, is what it is all about. 
  That same Vyacheslav Marychev evidently derived particular 
pleasure when, causing a furor among Serbian journalists, he 
brandished in front of the television camera, for example, a 
sheaf of papers that he had just received from Radovan Karadzic 
and proclaimed: "We have just witnessed the most important event 
for our delegation! We have been handed this folder, which 
contains the whole truth about the Yugoslav war and about the 
crimes of the Muslims!..." It was of no consequence to the 
ardent liberal democrat that the delegation had not at that time 
fulfilled even one-third of the scheduled program and that the 
next day it had to make its way to the Muslim side of Sarajevo, 
where meetings with the leaders of Bosnia were planned. 
  And several days later, during a visit to Serb Krajina, he 
thought nothing of provoking a most veritable row. In Vukovar 
the delegation had to split into two groups, one of which 
quickly flew on a UN aircraft to Zagreb. Mr. Marychev saw off 
his colleagues with a public toast "to loyalty" raised at an 
official reception: Look, Serbian comrades, he said, "your true 
friends are staying behind with you, the traitors are flying off 
to bend the knee to your enemies".... And what were the others 
supposed to do here? Spit with irritation? Give him no further 
assistance? It was a good thing that the trip to Vukovar was at 
least right at the very end of the program. 
  But we are getting ahead of ourselves, I believe. 
<H5>  War in Paradise </H5>
  The delegation achieved nothing in regard to point one of 
the 
mandate given its representatives by the Duma (in the form in 
which we have attempted to imagine this mandate). Sorting out 
the causes of the present Balkan war, inconceivable in its 
brutality and obduracy, is not the task of a week's journey. 
  It is said that civil wars are always accompanied by the 
warring peoples' mass infatuation with their own history. The 
present war in the Balkans is no exception: This maniacal 
passion for historical digressions, for the most detailed 
expositions of more or less pseudo-scientific theories as to the 
causes and consequences of medieval ethnic migrations, and for 
an exegesis of the subtlest details of intrigues and political 
interests, which have time after time set European powers 
against one another in the Balkans, is revealed immediately in 
any conversational partner, regardless of his citizenship, 
nationality, religious belief, or social position. 
  One motif, the most striking, perhaps, is easily noticeably 
in this entire historical-method complex. The war in the former 
Yugoslavia undoubtedly did not begin at the moment when the 
Socialist Federated Republic of Yugoslavia, orphaned without 
Marshal Tito, formally ceased to exist. This is by no means a 
"discrete," "independent" war but a continuation of some 
other--of far larger scale. Of a war by no means settled, as has 
thus far mistakenly been believed, but merely asleep. And with 
whoever you talk now--in Belgrade or Zagreb, Sarajevo, Pale, or 
Vukovar--it sooner or later appears, all the same, that the 
argument is about only one thing: the kind of war that is being 
continued.... 
  In Belgrade you are necessarily reminded of the history of 
the Ottoman conquest of Southeast Europe. The line on the map 
delineating the two civilizations--Christian and Islamic--where 
the invasion was halted is shown on the map. Nowadays this line 
almost coincides with Croatia's southern border: Serbs, becoming 
something akin to European Cossacks, growing into the image of 
warrior-people, and getting used to living in the eternal 
semi-siege conditions of a "buffer zone," are scattered along 
its horseshoe. These territories now belong to Croatia and 
Bosnia, but it is here that the RSK and the RS have arisen. 
  It is 1937 that is mentioned primarily in Zagreb and 
Sarajevo. The peak of the development of the prewar Serbian 
nationalist movement. The first plans for ethnic purges in 
Kosovo. The birth of the idea of a Greater Serbia: It is to this 
that the present Milosevic regime aspires, they say. It is to 
this that the plans for the wresting away of Krajina and Eastern 
Hercegovina lead. 
  Belgrade historians have collected and published a gigantic 
amount of material devoted to the genocide of the Serbian people 
in the years of World War II. Reference books, white papers, 
atlases, and collections of photographs are all awaiting 
presentation to an unknown international tribunal that will 
someday condemn the crimes of the Croatian Ustasa. Croatia's 
Ante Pavelic was Germany's loyal ally in the war. Some 600,000 
Serbs were exterminated in Croatia's concentration camps. 
  Zagreb is ready with a response. The morbid epic of the 
Serbian Chetniks, who were a dependable support of the 
Italo-German occupation of Croatia closer to the end of the war. 
  And so on ad infinitum. 
  But among the sundry opinions there is one according to 
which 
the preconditions of the tragedy should be sought far closer in 
time. December 1964 is marked especially in the chronology of 
the Yugoslav crisis compiled by the Belgrade European Studies 
Institute: "The national affiliation of the chosen members of 
the party leadership was read out at the Eighth League of 
Communists of Yugoslavia Congress in order for republic and 
regional parity within the federal party leadership to be 
introduced at the next, ninth, congress (March 1969).... At the 
eighth congress J. Broz Tito for the first time publicly 
declared himself to be a Croat...." 
  Perhaps this really is where the whole problem lies: The 
communist chiefs, even though they knew that they were building 
their federation on a huge ethnic mine, themselves set the 
timing mechanism. This was the official ideology they had 
chosen: It was ordained that everyone firmly remember each 
minute his national affiliation. Although they had hit on point 
five on the passport and on each trifling piece of paper, the 
Stalinist ideologues still preferred to stop somewhere half-way. 
  Socialist Federated Yugoslavia survived Tito by 10 years. It 
then exploded: The charge had been primed ahead of time. Some 
people, it would seem, are still hoping to put the scattered 
fragments back together again and are for the sake of this 
prepared to saturate this land with blood a meter deep. This is, 
most likely, the case. Why, otherwise, this carnage? 
  It is impossible to put credence in the "struggle for living 
space" and the suffering from "suffocating closeness" version. A 
week of journeying around the former Yugoslav republics 
compelled the belief that this war is being fought directly in 
paradise. And if paradise has its own, "inner" Eden, it was this 
that had to become the arena of the most savage and most 
destructive slaughter, what is more. There are more modest 
places here--the monotonous and flat Vojvodina, for example. All 
is quiet there. There, at least, fortunately. 
  But Bosnia is an unimaginable, luxuriant beauty. Mighty 
mountains, and at the same time ones that have been inhabited 
and built up by man down the ages. Spacious and fruitful 
valleys. Full rivers. Succulent pastures. Very rich mineral 
resources. The solidity and sturdy sufficiency of cities and 
villages. Splendid roads. A developed industry that has not, 
however strange, deformed the environment. How many more people 
could this land keep in sufficiency and prosperity? Who was 
cramped here? For what devil was all this not enough? 
  Something does not square with the widely discussed 
religious 
underpinnings of the hostility either. The localities of the 
traditional preponderance of Muslim and Orthodox here curiously 
interlay one another. Dozens of villages along the roadsides, 
and not a single mosque. Churches come into view from time to 
time, but far less frequently than in the Russian heartland, 
say. By no means above each large village do you find a cross. 
It is said that both warring armies are destroying the other's 
places of worship in planned fashion--but there would then have 
to be extant ruins, at least.... They are not to be seen. Homes 
destroyed, thousands, but churches and mosques, no. Muslim 
families eat pork in large quantities and with pleasure. On the 
Orthodox table the most customary and traditional dish consists 
of little pieces of meat: lyulya kebab it is usually called. 
What could be more dispassionate and true evidence than the 
cuisine? 
  The arbitrary nature of the "Muslim" concept is no secret in 
the former Yugoslavia, incidentally. Back at the start of the 
1970's a list of the ethnic communities living in the Socialist 
Federated Republic of Yugoslavia was enshrined legislatively. 
Two unique innovations pertain to that moment: the nationality 
"Yugoslav," for indeterminate citizens born of mixed marriages, 
more often than not, and the nationality "Muslim." Nationality, 
precisely, by no means implying obligatory religious affiliation 
but indicating merely the area of habitation. 
  Over what the war was being fought in paradise simply 
remained an unsolved puzzle for the Duma researchers. Within the 
framework of normal human logic it is, most likely, insoluble in 
principle, for that matter. 
  But one further observation was made here, on the other 
hand: 
If this is indeed paradise, it is for everyone. The military 
included. From all the signs, combat operations in these 
mountains could be conducted eternally, particularly if the 
methods of guerrilla warfare are employed. The mountains are 
sufficiently high and extensive as to render ineffective the use 
of modern military equipment, aviation particularly, and to 
reduce to nothing all efforts to bring the territory under 
dependable control. At the same time, on the other hand, they 
are just so high as not to create additional difficulties in 
movement for small mobile subunits and flying squads, simply 
put, gangs. And the well-developed infrastructure of roads and 
supply lines ensures altogether comfortable conditions for 
guerrilla operations. 
<H5>  The Innocent and the Guilty </H5>
  Now the "innocent" and the "guilty." There are neither in 
the 
Balkan war, of course. It is perfectly certain, in any event, 
that there are no longer any "innocent" here. At the very first 
moment of armed confrontation, perhaps, one party might have 
been considered the victim, the other, the aggressor, but no one 
will ever prove this now. Because in the three years of war too 
much hatred has accumulated in this country. Each successive 
killing is now revenge for a previous one. And that alone. All 
the rest is immaterial. And the devastated and plundered 
villages, whose population was massacred to a man, appear 
absolutely identical and fill the heart of the passerby with an 
identical horror. Whether these villages are Muslim, Croat, or 
Serb. 
  Since May 1991 everyone here has, it seems, fought with 
everyone else and everyone has come to hate everyone else. At 
first the multinational Yugoslav People's Army attempted to 
perform its "constitutional duty to defend the territorial 
integrity of the Socialist Federated Republic of Yugoslavia," 
counterposing force of arms to Slovenia's declaration of 
independence. It then, considerably more decisively and 
aggressively, opposed the plans for Croatia's conversion into an 
independent state. Subsequently the clashes switched, formally, 
to purely ethnic soil. Croats fought Serbs. The Bosnian Croats, 
the Bosnian Muslims. The Muslims, among themselves. Some Serbs, 
against other Serbs. Now the united forces of Croats and 
Muslims, against the Serbs. 
  To ascertain the degree of guilt and innocence of the 
parties 
to any conflict, world diplomacy makes active use of a method 
that is essentially naive and astonishingly ineffective: It 
affords the quarreling leaders an opportunity to have their say 
and dispatches its representatives to hear them out. No adequate 
substitute for this procedure has been devised: The use of 
neutral observers produces only crumbs of fragmentary 
information. And diplomatic emissaries are forced to endlessly 
filter through interim protocols, declarations, and communiques 
those same long-known arguments, inevitable in their depressing 
predictability. It is necessary more often than not to be a 
virtuoso professional to be able to extract from the pile of 
negotiating dross the subtlest nuance: a change of position, an 
initiative, a concession, a hint at a readiness to compromise. 
  It would be foolish to expect that an untrained crew of 
deputies would with its bare hands latch onto some large 
diplomatic nugget. But enough of negotiating work and to spare 
fell to the lot of the Russian Duma members in Yugoslavia. 
  Let us make clear for fairness' sake that the Serbian side 
was represented in the program considerably more fully and that 
its leaders had incomparably more favorable opportunities for 
setting forth their viewpoint. In five days the Russian 
delegation was received altogether by the top leaders of the FRY 
(Bozovic, speaker of the lower house of parliament, Prime 
Minister Kontic, his deputy Simic, Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Jovanovic, and Minister of Defense Bulatovic), Milosevic, 
president of Serbia, top leaders of the Serb Republic (President 
Karadzic, Prime Minister Lukic, and Kraisnik, head of 
parliament), and the leaders of Serb Krajina (Mikelic, chairman 
of the government, and Bojnica, chairman of the Skupstina). And 
the deputies spent only a day--and, as already mentioned, only a 
small part of the delegation even at that--in the capital of 
Croatia, although even here they met with Valentic, chairman of 
the government, and Mesic, chairman of the House of 
Representatives. The visitors spent only a matter of hours on 
the Muslim side of Sarajevo, on the other hand, confining 
themselves to quite a brief conversation with Silajdzic, prime 
minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Lazovic, speaker of the 
Bosnian parliament. 
  The distortion was compensated somewhat, come to that, by 
meetings with high-ranking officials of the United Nations and 
the Red Cross and with representatives of the UNPROFOR Command, 
including officers from the Russian "blue helmets" contingent. 
In addition, a particular part in the work of the parliamentary 
mission was played by staff of the Embassies of Russia in the 
FRY and Croatia. 
  It would, generally, be appropriate mentioning here that it 
is certainly not often that a team of diplomats of the class of 
that which operates at the Russian mission in Belgrade is 
selected. A member of the delegation once observed that the 
personnel of the Russian Embassy in Belgrade "knows the 
situation in somewhat greater depth even than diplomats have the 
right to know it." In fact, the many years of service (and there 
are in the embassy many career diplomats who are on not their 
first long-term assignment here and who have been working since 
the end and even from the middle of the 1980's here) have made 
the Russian representatives specialists of the highest class 
with a magnificent grasp of the stratagems of the Balkan 
political and military situation, the history of the former 
Yugoslav republics and their social and economic problems, and 
the subtleties of national mentality. There is no doubt that 
without their assistance the parliamentary mission would have 
had few chances of coping with the unchecked flow of arguments 
which was rained down on them in the quarreling capitals. 
  Although it very soon became obvious that these arguments 
could not be distinguished by any particular diversity. The 
Serbian leaders concentrated primarily on refuting the widely 
known charges leveled at them as the sole culprits of the 
aggressive attacks and savage bombardments resumed again and 
again around the "security zones" in Bosnia. 
  In justification of its actions, the Serbian leadership 
refers on each occasion to the fact that the "security zones" 
(the UNPROFOR force has as of this time organized six: around 
Sarajevo, Bihac, Goradze, Zepce, Srebrenica, and Tuzla) in fact 
afford no one any security inasmuch as the UN troops have not 
succeeded in demilitarizing them. UN observers, as also the 
diplomats permanently at the scene, confirm the justice of such 
complaints. Too many arms, they say, have been stockpiled in 
these areas, and it is not always possible to take control even 
of the heavy artillery systems and mortars. Small arms, of which 
each home is full, even less: It is not even a question of 
confiscating from the public, even registering them is 
impossible. 
  The Bosnian Muslims and the Croats are enjoying great 
success 
here in taking advantage of the UN cover in these zones for the 
concentration, recreation, and training of their troops. Viktor 
Andreyev, coordinator of the UN force for civilian affairs in 
Bosnia, recalled in this connection a recently published report 
of Butrus-Ghali, which set forth these facts in detail. Yasushi 
Akashi, special representative of the UN secretary general, also 
spoke with the Russian deputies about the same thing. 
  The "security zones" are becoming a convenient springboard 
for sudden attacks on the Serbian positions, after which the 
attackers safely pull back once again behind the backs of the 
"blue helmets." It is widely held in the world that the reports 
of a "Muslim spring offensive" were merely a clumsy propaganda 
ruse organized by the Karadzic regime. But officers of the 
peacekeeping force in Sarajevo confidently confirmed in response 
to the deputies' questions that an attempt at an offensive in 
the middle and toward the end of March really was made, and on a 
broad front. This Bosnian Army action was not crowned with big 
successes, and Serbs beat back the attack, but the offensive 
cannot, nonetheless, be seen other than as a large-scale 
provocation. The siege of Goradze, which was ended only at the 
price of a decisive show of force by NATO aircraft, was begun in 
response to the Muslims' actions. 
  The Muslim commanders, in the opinion of those same 
officers, 
have altogether shown themselves to be past masters at 
provocations. A colonel from the Ukrainian "blue helmets" 
contingent, Mikhail Tsinchenko, deputy UNPROFOR commander in the 
Sarajevo sector, reported that Muslim mortar batteries had 
repeatedly been installed and had begun to operate directly 
beneath the windows of his headquarters--in the hope of a 
response from the Serbian side. He affirms with certainty the 
truthfulness of the information on the deployment by the army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina of machine guns, mortars, and even field guns 
in proximity to humanitarian facilities or directly inside 
them--in hospitals, where refugees are concentrated, and so 
forth. And the Serbs quite often respond--with incredible 
ferocity and savagery. 
  Practically all witnesses to the conflict are prepared to 
acknowledge that in the majority of instances the Serb forces 
are actually counteracting and that the initiative of active 
combat operations usually comes from their enemy. But the 
inappropriate power of the Serbian "retribution" and the immense 
number of casualties among the peaceful population resulting 
from their "counterattacks" cannot be justified. And realistic 
estimates are needed here also, for that matter. The recent 
sensational AFP report from Goradze, against which the blockade 
had just been raised, on Muslim informants' multiple 
exaggeration of the details of those killed and wounded 
demonstrated that there are propaganda dodges here also. 
  But propaganda in this war is another matter, of exceptional 
importance in itself. 
<H5>  Information Catastrophe </H5>
  The Serbian leaders are today speaking with despair almost 
about the propaganda war, which they have conclusively lost. But 
there is no one to blame for this but themselves. If the 
atavisms of communist ideology characteristic of the ruling 
Serbian elite had to manifest themselves somewhere, they had to 
have done so sooner and more fully than anywhere else precisely 
in relations with the press. From the very start of the war the 
Serbian leadership adopted a demonstratively imperious and 
sharply worded tone in its dealings with journalists. 
  The Serbian political press is quite candid and 
unconstrained 
in its opinions. But only as long as this does not concern the 
progress of the war and relations with its Balkan neighbors. As 
far as foreign journalists are concerned, the Belgrade 
authorities have forced them to operate under extraordinarily 
difficult conditions. Strict censorship and the regular 
application of repressive measures: denial of right of access to 
the zones of combat operations, deprivation of accreditation, 
prohibitions on the transmission of reports to their editorial 
offices, expulsion from the country--all this has become routine 
practice here. The latest purge of foreign journalists occurred 
during the visit of the Russian delegation. Four correspondents 
of AFP (the whole of the Belgrade office), three reporters from 
CNN, and one each from the Sky News European television service 
and Radio Free Europe, and correspondents of LE MONDE, EL PAIS, 
DIE PRESSE, and THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR lost their 
accreditation in the FRY. 
  The leaders of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the other 
hand, have made special efforts to establish the most cordial 
and businesslike relations possible with the world press. The 
tactics of information warfare for which they have opted have 
been extraordinarily profitable and effective. The most 
auspicious working conditions that the laws of wartime permit 
have been created for the journalists of Western television 
companies, newspapers, and press agencies. It is sufficient to 
observe that the sole hotel in the Muslim part of Sarajevo that 
was relatively unscathed during the artillery shelling--the 
celebrated Holiday Inn--was set aside not for some army staff, 
ministry, or hospital even but for the accommodation of a 
colossal number of correspondent centers of the world's 
electronic and written press. Journalists are guaranteed a 
reasonable level of safety as they move around the territories 
of the warring republics and have been provided with transport, 
provisions, and, what is particularly valuable for any reporter, 
means of communication for transmitting his information. The 
UNPROFOR Command, which is also located in Zagreb, incidentally, 
has streamlined the issue of accreditation for permanent and 
temporary correspondents in the conflict zone. 
  As a result the vast majority of journalists covering the 
Balkan crisis are physically based on the Muslim-Croat side of 
the front. From a purely practical viewpoint this is far more 
convenient and rational than in the areas controlled by the 
Serbs, and for this reason you encounter practically no one 
there. But the result is that any shell exploding in direct 
proximity to the journalists' observation points is one that has 
come from the Serbian side. "Two dozen Western cameramen 
immediately rush to shoot any crater from the explosion of a 
Serbian shell," an officer of the headquarters of the Russian 
peacekeeping battalion in Sarajevo says, "and two dozen 
journalists ascertain the name of the person who was a casualty 
of this explosion. But no one sees exactly the same crater from 
a Muslim shell in a Serbian village. There is simply no one to 
come to inspect it...." 
  We repeat, the Serbian leaders have themselves created all 
the conditions for the manifest imbalance in the coverage of the 
events of the war. But journalists' true professionalism should, 
obviously, have consisted of preserving objectivity in spite of 
all the unpropitious circumstances. The world press was duty 
bound to display far more perseverance for the collection of 
full information adequate to the actual state of affairs in both 
hostile camps. The present situation, however, testifies to the 
defeat that has been sustained here by the international 
journalist community. 
<H5>  Leopard Skins </H5>
  The hopeless defeat on the information front is, perhaps, 
the 
sole setback of such a scale for the Serbs in the Balkan 
conflict. As far as the military aspect proper is concerned, 
their successes are impressive to any specialist. UN observers 
agree that the Serbian Army has been making almost ideal use of 
all the advantages conferred by the nature of the terrain, the 
type of combat operations, the numbers and training of the 
personnel, and the possibilities of modern arms. 
  The professional skill of the Serbian Army has compelled the 
appreciation not only of its direct adversary in the protracted 
war but of the UNPROFOR Command also. The world press has as of 
late been saying a great deal about a kind of duel by default 
that has been under way for several months now between General 
Rose, commander of the UN force in Bosnia, and General Mladic, 
commander of the army of the Serb Republic. The brilliant 
British officer Rose, a veteran of the Falklands War, is 
markedly inferior in this single combat. 
  A dispiriting impression was made on military specialists, 
for instance, by the Serb operation in the Goradze region. 
General Rose's staff was absolutely convinced that the zone of 
the latest stirring of the Serb forces would be the surrounds of 
Tuzla. Mladic, meanwhile, succeeded in breaking away from the 
hounding by UN observers, pulling back part of his army from 
Sarajevo, and then in just 24 hours transferring a 16,000-strong 
corps--together with heavy equipment, auxiliary subunits, field 
kitchens, the supply train, and everything else--to an entirely 
different part of the front zone, at the approaches to Goradze, 
where not long prior to this the Muslims had concentrated an 
armed contingent in a strength of almost 10,000 men. The 
appearance here of powerful Serb forces came as a complete 
surprise both to the enemy and to UNPROFOR. It actually became 
known only at the moment when the Serbs organized the 
concentrated shelling of the city and launched an assault. 
  How serious a lesson the "blue helmets" learned from this 
defeat, only the future will tell. But even now it is becoming 
increasingly apparent that the establishment of dependable 
control over the areas of combat operations and the effective 
and swift disarmament of the opposed armies by the efforts of 
the UN troops are hardly to be seriously expected. The 
peacekeeping contingents will not stop the animosity in the 
Balkans by force of will, even if their numbers are increased 
many times over. 
  In addition, the experience of the use of international 
peacekeeping forces on various continents shows that the 
intensiveness of their involvement in active combat operations 
cannot grow for any period of time longer than public opinion in 
the countries that have sent army units to the zones of 
bloodshed permits. "Neither your country nor any other has sent 
its children to die in another's war" was the reminder with 
which General Rose began his conversation with the Russian 
members of parliament at UNPROFOR's Sarajevo headquarters. His 
statements to the effect that the UN force "does not intend to 
take its place in the Muslim trenches and fight in place of the 
army of Bosnia-Herzegovina" became known several days later. 
  There are, evidently, no purely military ways of settling 
the 
conflict. Negotiating methods remain. The Serbian side is 
demonstrating here, at first sight, far more assertive 
initiative. There was no perception of a lack of statements 
concerning "the Serbian people's ardent aspiration to a complete 
and conclusive end to the hostility on the soil of Yugoslavia" 
in a single one of the speeches of high-ranking officials heard 
by the Russian delegation in Belgrade, Pale, and Vukovar. 
  But it has to be recognized that such statements are being 
made by the Serbs today from a position of strength. In the 
estimation of military experts, the Serbian Army has, in fact, 
accomplished all its most important combat missions and now 
firmly holds sway throughout the region of the conflict. It is 
not even a question of the extent of the territories which it 
has taken under control but of the quality of these territories. 
Strategically key heights, roads, bridges, and industrial 
facilities are now, for the most part, in the hands of the 
authorities of the Serb Republic. The military-political 
situation established around Serb Krajina is entirely favorable 
to it also. 
  This is why the Serb side can permit itself to look down on 
all diplomatic projects and plans offered it from outside. All 
these plans amount essentially to numerous versions of the 
"leopard's skin" drawing on geographical maps of the Balkans, to 
a fancifully painted mosaic of zones and territories to be 
secured under the control of the Serb, Croat, and Muslim 
authorities, under a UN protectorate. 
  The Vance-Owen Plan is such. As is the Owen-Stoltenberg 
Plan. 
And the Vance-Owen Plan once again, but as amended by 
Izetbegovic. And the plan of proposals of the Muslim-Croat 
Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. None of them evokes even the 
least enthusiasm among the Serbs. None, to be honest, appears 
really viable: There are no states that have been chopped into 
such tiny noodles. Such states would not live long. Especially 
after a most savage three-year war. 
  It would be odd to accuse the delegation of Russian members 
of parliament of not having fulfilled the most important point 
of the Duma mandate. The deputies did not bring to Moscow any 
miraculous prescription for a resolution of the Balkan crisis. 
It simply does not exist in nature. 
  Not yet. And it remains to believe, it seems, those who 
maintain that the time of the birth of the lifesaving idea that 
will one day restore hope of peace to all who are participating 
in the bloody Yugoslav drama has not yet come. It is dreadful to 
have to say this, but people have not had their fill of fighting 
here yet. Yugoslavia has been ravaged and deformed by war, but 
has not yet been exhausted, evidently, to the extent that 
revulsion and horror at what has been done have forced its 
leaders and its peoples to solicit peace. Not from one another. 
Not, more precisely, enemy from enemy. Among themselves.
