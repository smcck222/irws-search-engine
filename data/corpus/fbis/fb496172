<F P=106> [Interview with Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the </F>
Committee for CIS Affairs and Relations With Compatriots, by 
Andrey Sharyy; place and date not given: "Carthage Is To Be 
Restored?"] 
  [Text] The April tour of a group of Russian deputies 
of the republics of the former federative Yugoslavia lasted nine 
days. 
  According to one of its members, Konstantin Zatulin, 
chairman 
of the Committee for CIS Affairs and Relations With Compatriots, 
the delegation "went practically everywhere and met practically 
everyone." "Certain obvious conclusions" of the group were 
offered the Duma at the end of the past week, in the form, 
specifically, of a draft federal law on a suspension of Russia's 
participation in the sanctions against the FRY [Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia]. 
  "We consider it essential that the Duma address to the 
parliaments and peoples of the world a message reflecting its 
idea of how the Yugoslav conflict should be settled," Konstantin 
Zatulin shared his conclusions. "First, an immediate cease-fire, 
without any conditions. The second idea is an appeal to 
parliaments that they not add fuel to the fire. Finally, the 
third initiative concerns a conference with the participation of 
the great powers and the Balkan countries, which would discuss, 
in particular, the prospects of a lifting of sanctions in 
respect to the new Yugoslavia." 
  [Sharyy] This initiative is, obviously, the main conclusion 
that the group of Russian deputies reached in the course of 
their trip? 
  [Zatulin] Yes, and it is reflected in the documents of the 
State Duma: that it be recommended that the president, the 
government, and the Foreign Ministry adopt vigorous measures 
within the UN framework for a repeal of sanctions. I would like 
to explain why Carthage, which is to be destroyed, is in this 
case to be restored. Sanctions are pernicious and ineffective. 
However paradoxical, they have united the Serb people now living 
on the territory of various states. Militarily, the prohibitory 
measures do not play a big part: The armed might of the Serbs is 
great enough. But when it is a question of the position of the 
civilian population, the prospect of social conflicts.... Here, 
yes, sanctions are simply strangling Yugoslavia. The immorality 
of an attempt to bring an entire people to the brink of 
extinction is obvious. 
  That Russia formerly adopted the decision to participate in 
the sanctions is a cause of constant internal political 
friction. We were in too much of a hurry, disregarding the 
country's national interests, and all of Russia's subsequent 
diplomatic maneuvers have been clumsy attempts at 
self-rehabilitation. 
  [Sharyy] The Duma occupies a hard-line position in respect 
to 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it would seem? 
  [Zatulin] Deputies structuring their relations with the 
diplomats on a confrontational basis is not what I would want. 
But we are having to do this, unfortunately: Compliance with the 
decision of the State Duma is being monitored, and unless the 
Foreign Ministry and the government take the appropriate action, 
we shall be forced to pass a law on Russia's unilateral 
withdrawal from the regime of sanctions. This is a disputed, 
declaratory decision, which will do little, but it will help 
Russia preserve its honor. And honor is something in itself. It 
is absolutely pointless for our foreign minister to imagine 
himself a latter-day George the Dragon-Slayer, who is intent on 
lancing socialism and communism in Serbia. 
  I am concerned for the friendship of Russia and Serbia, but 
I 
do not believe that friendship can justify everything. What kind 
of friendship of Moscow and Belgrade, generally, are we talking 
about? The Serbs had and continue to have a desire to rely on 
Moscow, but our Foreign Ministry has never endeavored to lend a 
hand. Russia cannot allow a people that are related to it to be 
reduced to a primitive condition. The Yugoslav conflict has 
demonstrated that no one can be confident of his own security 
with a hungry, confused neighbor, one armed to the teeth, what 
is more. The Serbs, like the Russians, are not in a position to 
secure for themselves a decent life but they could perfectly 
well spoil the life of others.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Karpov: "Yeltsin and Kohl Have Attempted </F>
To Peer Into the Future: This Thought Is Suggested by a Close 
Inspection of the Results of the Visit"] 
  [Text] Bonn-Moscow--It is customary to consider that the 
main content of the Russian president's second visit to Germany 
was defined by a set of several mutual problems with the tinge 
of a row in the making, primarily the withdrawal of the troops 
and restitution. It was to these, in the main, that the material 
of journalists accredited to the visit were devoted. In actual 
fact, the range of issues was incomparably wider. NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA has already written about the jointly formulated 
approaches to Russia's membership of the Council of Europe and 
its affiliation to the Partnership for Peace, its participation 
in the political aspect of the Naples G-7 meeting, and the 
expansion of the number of permanent members of the UN Security 
Council. 
  The range of problems lacking a tie-in with the present 
moment was not confined to these. The ceremonial act of 31 
August in Berlin will definitely dot the "i" in the culminating 
stage of Russian-German relations. Will it be conclusive for the 
sphere of the Russian Federation's dealings with the rest of 
Europe and the world? Yeltsin believes that it could be dotted 
in December in Budapest at the meeting of heads of state and 
government of the participants in the CSCE. There, the president 
believes, it will be essential to harmonize the principles of 
the international arrangement on the basis of which we enter the 
21st century. Simultaneously Yeltsin's approach will give a good 
boost to the more assertive activity of the CSCE, for which 
other abbreviations have more often been substituting in the 
international arena as of late. 
  Next year the world will commemorate the 50th anniversary of 
the end of World War II, which also could be seen as the 
starting position for the building of the new world order. But 
there are certain apprehensions as to whether Russo-German 
relations might by this time have lost their present quality. 
The victory of the Social Democrats, who are currently in 
opposition, is expected at the November Bundestag elections. And 
much water will have flown in Russia also in this time. 
Optimists are rejecting the possibility of a cardinal change in 
the foreign policy course of both countries since they are in 
exceptional need of one another for a strengthening of their own 
authority in the world. Pessimists are certain of the appearance 
of a new balancing act. The position of Germany, following its 
release from the stigma of vanquished state, will, they 
calculate, become tougher and more demanding. In respect to 
Russia the arguments will amount to its increasingly distinct 
desire to demand respect for its geopolitical interests. There 
is no escaping differences under such conditions, it would seem. 
But the point is that this outline forgets the objective 
prerequisites of the joint actions of the Russian Federation and 
the FRG in the international arena. And no political forces can 
disregard them. Boris Yeltsin, incidentally, is, by all 
accounts, preparing for a change of guard in Bonn. The 
invitation to visit Moscow extended to a favorite in the 
struggle for the office of chancellor, Rudolf Scharping, 
chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and prime 
minister of the land of Rhineland-Pfalz, testifies to this. And 
this did not, it would seem, appear tactless in respect to Kohl 
but testified merely to Moscow's desire, given any political 
alignments, to preserve the "special" character of the 
relationship with Bonn, which will require serenity and 
farsightedness. Nor is there any desire for a loss of the latter 
on the Rhine, where a readiness to meet with Russian politicians 
of various stripes has been stated--who does not realize that 
the political era of Boris Yeltsin is not infinite? 
  Thus a fitting continuation of what has been started may 
perfectly well be expected in the future also. A different 
situation could arise in international affairs. One example: The 
response to the announcement of Germany's decision to support 
Russia in its aspirations as regards the G-7 on the part, 
primarily, of the United States and Japan was guarded, to say 
the least. It softened a while later, it is true. But the 
possibilities of this discrepancy or the other arising in the 
future also cannot, it would seem, be ruled out. 
  The vectors of temporary contradictions could take shape in 
other directions also. Removing the chance of their emergence if 
only in some is possible only by constant work on the future, 
into which Yeltsin and Kohl attempted at the time of the visit 
to peer.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Tsekhmistrenko, KOMMERSANT-DAILY </F>
columnist: "Negotiations in Geneva on Bosnia: State Duma 
Accompanies Kozyrev and Christopher Duet"] 
  [Text] On the eve of the Geneva meeting held Friday 
by the heads of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Russia, the 
United States, Great Britain, and a "trio" of the European Union 
(Belgium, Greece, and Germany), few would have ventured to 
predict its success: Too much divided the great powers. But, 
fortunately, as has happened more than once in history, 
everything occurred exactly the wrong way round: The ministers 
who came out on the stage of the conference hall of the Hotel 
Intercontinental after six hours of intensive negotiations 
informed the world of the birth of a new political sensation. 
The results of the Geneva meeting are analyzed by Sergey 
Tsekhmistrenko, KOMMERSANT-DAILY columnist, who has just 
returned from Geneva. 
<H5>  51:49 in Favor of Russian Diplomacy </H5>
  Although the idea for a meeting of the ministers of foreign 
affairs was formally proposed by Moscow and Paris, Russia 
deserves the main credit for the fact that it did occur. Perhaps 
the negotiations between Andrey Kozyrev and United States 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the beginning of May in 
Cairo were the turning point--at that time the Russian minister 
succeeded in convincing the American, who had assessed the 
potential of a "Geneva meeting" skeptically. However, almost up 
until late night on 13 May it seemed to all of those who arrived 
on the shores of Lake Geneva that reality would confirm 
Christopher's correctness. But the communique distributed before 
the final news conference indicated the opposite: The desired 
compromise was found. And precisely thanks to Russia. 
  Essentially, the communique proposes an integral settlement 
concept whose central element was principally a new approach to 
the future arrangement of the Bosnian state. Henceforth it will 
be viewed in its way as a union consisting of two 
parts--Bosnian-Serb and Bosnian-Croat (what is meant in the 
latter case is the Muslim-Croat federation that is being 
established). Moreover, from the standpoint of international 
law, both sides are given equal status. As for the key 
problem--territorial demarcation--the ministers proposed to 
resolve it after dividing the Bosnian territory between the 
federation and the Serbs in a ratio of 51 to 49. But peace was 
necessary to implement all of this, and therefore it was decided 
to call on the sides to conclude an agreement on a cessation of 
military operations for four months, which could be prolonged 
afterwards. Direct negotiations of the parties to the conflict 
were also supposed to be renewed--this was to be achieved by a 
contact group of the world community, which in the course of the 
next two weeks was to convince the Serbs and the Muslims with 
the Croats to continue the dialogue that had been broken off. 
  As for the question of sanctions (against both the FRY 
((Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)) and with respect to the 
embargo on the supply of arms to the Muslims), Russia and the 
West agreed for the first time in Geneva that they should be 
observed rigorously, and that they could be gradually canceled 
only after the implementation of the aforementioned points. The 
removal of sanctions as a preliminary condition of a settlement 
was rejected. 
  Russian diplomats in Geneva really felt cheered in Geneva. 
And not by chance: The main points of the adopted plan were set 
forth in a message from Boris Yeltsin to Clinton, Mitterrand, 
Major, and Kohl. As was reported to the KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
columnist by a highly placed official at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of Russia, a majority of the provisions of the letter 
were included in the communique practically without any changes. 
Never before have Moscow's proposals been implemented so 
completely at such meetings. In this connection, in the opinion 
of a Russian diplomat, it can be considered that Russia today is 
really playing a leading role in the settlement, although it was 
not very long ago that the palm leaf of victory belonged to the 
European Union. Incidentally, Kozyrev also observed: In the heat 
of polemics in the negotiations, the Western colleagues appealed 
more than once to Yeltsin's letter as a primary source. 
  But there were also two other circumstances that determined 
the outcome of the negotiations. I refer to the adoption on 12 
and 13 May respectively of resolutions of the United States 
Senate and the State Duma of Russia on the question of 
sanctions. News about these decisions suddenly rallied the main 
players--Kozyrev and Christopher. 
<H5>  Our Main Thought--That There Will Be No Pol Pot </H5>
  The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia 
commented in an interview with journalists on the lively 
interest of the members of the Duma--to the detriment of 
domestic problems--in the words of a well-known Soviet ditty. 
Nevertheless, there was an unexpected effect when they learned 
of the Duma resolution in Geneva, where there was talk of a 
unilateral departure by Moscow from the sanctions regime against 
the FRY in the event the United States removed the embargo on 
the supply of weapons to the Muslims. Both Kozyrev and 
Christopher, in order not to permit a war of parliaments, 
decided to avoid extremes. Judging by the communique, Moscow 
rejected a former position--the gradual removal of sanctions 
right now (in the form of its own kind of overture that recently 
displayed a yielding to Belgrade), but Washington did not insist 
on the opposite, that is, on a toughening of sanctions. Both 
ministers disavowed the decisions of their parliaments. But 
while this has become a usual thing for Kozyrev (it is enough to 
mention his battles with the Supreme Soviet), Christopher's step 
was perhaps unprecedented. 
  In general, Christopher was placed in a very awkward 
position 
in Geneva. Just the day before, Washington assured the partners 
that the Muslims with the Croats have agreed to 51 percent of 
the territory of Bosnia. Therefore, when it became known that 
the wards had misled the patron, demanding 58 percent, confusion 
resulted, although Charles Redman, the special representative of 
the United States, attempted to present all of this as "a joke." 
But, in addition, the map of the division proposed by the 
Muslims and the Croats said little about their peaceful 
disposition. In the words of one of the officials of the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this was a "war map," inasmuch as 
an attempt was made in it to transform the Serbian enclaves into 
territories that were not connected. 
  However, it will not be easy to put the Geneva agreements 
into effect. For the Serbs today control almost 73 percent of 
the territory of Bosnia, and few believe that it will be 
possible to convince them to "squeeze" into 49 percent. Indeed, 
President of Bosnia Alija Izetbegovic has also already expressed 
the first doubts regarding the initiatives by Russia and the 
West. However, Kozyrev, after flying into Moscow, was in an 
optimistic mood--nobody from the Bosnian side has yet expressed 
complete rejection. But "who is who" will become evident within 
two weeks: If by that time no movement occurs, then, in the apt 
expression of one Russian diplomat, the world community will put 
the "carrot and stick" in motion. But it is already clear today 
that a new page has been written in the history of the 
settlement of the Yugoslav conflict.

    [Editorial Report] Norway has signed two agreements with 
Russia that will help prevent oil blowouts and other industrial 
accidents. 
  The daily AFTENPOSTEN of 25 May in Norwegian on page 6 
reported that the first agreement involves a collaborative 
effort between the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Norwegian 
Academy of Technical Sciences to create safety legislation for 
new installations in the oil sector. Russia has committed 30 
manpower years to the effort, and the Norwegian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs has granted 1.l million kroner to fund the 
Norwegian researchers involved in the project through 1994. 
  The second agreement involves a project for quality control 
requirements within the industry. Russia has committed 30 
manpower years to this project as well, and the Norwegian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs will spend 600,000 kroner on it. 
  An agreement for a collaborative project on risk analyses of 
the nuclear plants on the Kola peninsula is also planned. 
  The agreements are in response to a request by the Russian 
Academy of Sciences and took 18 months to work out.

<F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Economic Science Prokopiy Drachev, </F>
first vice president of the Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and 
Lessees: "Russian Small Business and Western Big Capital"] 
  [Text] The creation and development of a network of 
small and medium-size enterprises in different sectors of the 
national economy in the conditions of crisis in the Russian 
economy is a number one priority in order to saturate the 
consumer market with goods and services, create new jobs, and 
bring into production unused production and material resources. 
Such enterprises will help develop competition, overcome 
sectoral and territorial monopolism, improve the economy and the 
financial sphere, and expand export potential. 
<H5>  While They Were Being Set Up, the Money Melted Away </H5>
  At first glance, small business is constantly at the center 
of attention. It has been said many times what exactly 
entrepreneurs need in order to get on their feet, flourish, and 
even expand abroad. In reality, however, the state's attitude 
toward small business has not changed at all. The standards 
applied to them--tax, credit, and leasing--were the same as 
those applied to large businesses. 
  The president of Russia's decree on the development of small 
and medium-size business proved unfocused, declarative, 
consisting of generalized statements and exhortations for the 
ministries to support entrepreneurship economically. 
  In May 1993 the president and the government did finally 
issue a decree on priority measures in small business 
development. It contained the main point: the decision to 
allocate money for their development and instructions to the new 
Fund for Support of Entrepreneurship and Development of 
Competition to distribute it. According to economists' 
calculations, however, 100 billion rubles [R] is needed to 
revive the small business sphere rather than the R25 billion 
that has been allocated--and even that only on paper. By the end 
of the year only R5 billion was left at the fund's disposal. 
Members of our union (who presented relevant programs) also 
counted on some share of that money. Unfortunately, the 
procedure for distributing the money turned out to be very 
complex, and the fund has never really managed to get a grip on 
it. For more than half a year it was busy setting itself up and 
developing a concept of monetary distribution, while the money 
melted away under the onslaught of inflation. 
  With this arrangement, small business will not see 
fundamental changes in the foreseeable future. According to 
preliminary data, in the future the Fund for Support of 
Entrepreneurship and Development of Competition intends to use 
the long-awaited money as credit that will be provided to small 
businesses on the same terms as the Central Bank's prime 
rate--210 percent annually. In order to utilize such credit 
successfully, the amount has to be turned over four times a 
year. This means that it can be used only for trading, not 
production. Entrepreneurship in the production sphere, the one 
capable of saturating the market with goods and services, needs 
preferential credit support and taxation regime, exemption of 
reinvested profit from taxation, and a tax break of two to four 
years depending on the nature of the production. 
  Alas, Russia has practically already chosen a very 
unfavorable road for the development of entrepreneurship. Its 
fate was determined by the government, which made changes to tax 
legislation that left entrepreneurs in a state of shock. Tax 
rates and indirect taxes were increased, new taxes and duties 
introduced. As a result, an entrepreneur will have to give up 
for public needs 35-43 percent of profits, and the combined tax 
on payroll reaches almost 40 percent. The only real benefit 
small businesses got is exemption from paying estimated tax on 
profit. It is also very good that profit reinvested in capital 
assets and put into R&amp;D and design work (NIOKR) will not be 
taxable. However, in the current conditions few small 
enterprises can afford such expenditures without additional 
credits. 
<H5>  Security--in 149th Place </H5>
  In this situation small business could get help from foreign 
investment, but the terms of obtaining it and the insignificant 
volume do not meet the current needs and cannot satisfy Russian 
entrepreneurs. The main reason, in the opinion of international 
financial organizations, is that the investment climate in 
Russia over the past five to six years has changed for the 
worse. For instance, the financial magazine YEVROPEYSKIYE DENGI 
("European Money") in March 1993 placed Russia in 149th place 
(among 169 countries) in terms of investment security. In 
addition to difficulties built into the code of law, foreign 
investors also encounter many organizational and informational 
problems. This precipitates their reluctance to increase 
investment in Russia. 
  Privatization with the participation of foreign investment 
can and should play an important role in the development of 
small and medium-size business. It opens the opportunity for the 
free import into Russia of managerial experience and know-how. 
Another advantage of such privatization is that enterprises 
undergoing privatization will be appraised at their real value. 
A private investor will invest his money only if he is certain 
that the enterprise he is acquiring will flourish and bring in 
profit. So far he is encountering only difficulties, the main 
among which remains the haphazardness of economic legislation. 
For instance, certain types of activities are permitted only by 
license; quite often far from the best facilities--take it or 
leave it--are offered for privatization; there are numerous 
restrictions regarding auctions and competitive bids, while 
almost all such deals must be licensed. For the foreign business 
world the Law on Foreign Investment in Russia, which contains 
the most general provisions with a considerable set of 
restrictive conditions, so far has not become a document for 
practical action. Serious modifications to it are urgently 
needed, as well as developing as soon as possible a set of 
accompanying documents that will specify in concrete terms the 
norms of participation and preferences for foreign investors. 
  Until recently, however, Russian state bodies did not treat 
seriously the problem of attracting foreign investment. The 
Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees petitioned the former 
Russian Federation Supreme Soviet on these issues many times but 
never received a reply. However, the issues raised a year ago 
have not lost their urgency. The main among them, in the union's 
opinion, is the question of ownership rights. It still has not 
been defined clearly who and at what level makes the decisions 
on granting which kind of ownership. From the standpoint of 
international standards, we have not defined ownership rights at 
all, and therefore a foreign investor does not know what he can 
count on when he acquires a Russian enterprise. In order to 
create a favorable investment climate it is also necessary not 
only to make corrections to the legislation but also to 
guarantee observance of already existing statutes. 
  Structures qualified to work competently with foreign 
investors of capital in Russia so far are not sufficiently 
developed. Potential foreign investors are reluctant to come 
into the Russian market among other reasons because they do not 
find local structures professionally trained to interact with 
them. 
<H5>  International Investment Center Will Select a Company </H5>
  Against the background of such unfavorable trends, the 
Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees, in partnership with 
the international consortium Newform International (Paris), in 
August 1993 created the International Investment Center, whose 
task is to facilitate attracting foreign investment into the 
Russian economy. 
  The center was founded in order to bring together and 
utilize 
the experience of specialized consulting and engineering firms, 
whose sphere of activities encompasses the main spheres of 
applied knowledge. All projects are carried out by independent 
international experts. The center will transfer to the customer 
the technologies and ensure the participation of local partners 
in the project. 
  Through its international contacts, the center will select 
for each project a company responsible for its implementation, 
based on its experience and reputation, as well as the knowledge 
of local conditions. The company to which the project 
implementation will be commissioned uses as needed the 
capabilities of all members of the Newform International 
consortium. Well-integrated into the world economy with 
international contacts, the center's flexible structure and its 
multiprofile orientation allow it to develop and realize 
technically and economically most complex projects and pick the 
management for them. 
  The International Investment Center has already begun to 
implement a number of projects. Among them, first and foremost 
we should mention the project to develop a timber raw material 
base in one of the rayons in Tomsk Oblast utilizing waste-free 
wood processing technology and the development of a social 
infrastructure, and the project on the construction of an 
international airport in Ufa. 
  In addition, the International Investment Center has begun 
to 
actively promote abroad the products of members of the Russian 
Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees, using advertising and 
promotional materials supplied by customers, and assist in 
signing the contracts. On the other hand, it is using the 
capabilities of Newform International to identify potential 
buyers for their products. 
  The Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees has 
established working contacts with Russian ministries and 
agencies dealing with investment programs in order to identify 
Russian projects financed by foreign and Russian state 
institutions and funds, and determine how the International 
Investment Center may join in their implementation. 
  The regional unions of the Russian Union of Entrepreneurs 
and 
Lessees were advised to cooperate more closely with local 
administrations in developing and implementing investment 
projects and programs, and select concrete projects and designs 
for which the International Investment Center could provide, on 
a commercial and contract basis, international evaluation and 
find foreign investor companies. 
  The center closely cooperates with such recognized 
international specialized companies [as published] as the World 
Bank (Washington), the African Development Bank (Abidjan), the 
UN Development Program (New York), the UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization (Rome), the Asian Development Bank (Manila), and 
the Inter-American Development Bank (Washington). 
<H5>  Policy Must Be Registration-Based </H5>
  How do we stimulate and boost investment? I think that in 
order to achieve this it is necessary, in legislative order, to 
completely exempt from taxation domestic and foreign investment 
in the Russian economy (first and foremost in the development of 
small and medium-size business in priority sectors), as well as 
give up for a certain period of time taxing profits received. 
Incentives must be provided for capital to flow into those 
sectors and spheres of activities of small and medium-size 
business where the problems of life support and structural 
restructuring of the economy are concentrated: food production 
and processing, basic necessity goods production, etc. For this, 
however, our investment policy regarding potential investors 
must finally become based simply on registration. This may be 
perhaps one of the most cardinal problems of reforming the 
Russian economy today and in the future. 
  Implementation of the set of priority tasks in the area of 
developing small and medium-size business in Russia must not 
only ensure the achievement of goals associated with economic 
stabilization but also form a positive attitude toward 
entrepreneurial activities and the emerging entrepreneurial 
class.

<F P=106> [Supreme Council statement: "The Supreme Council Has </F>
Expressed a Lack of Confidence in the Socioeconomic and Legal 
Policy of the Government and Called for a Dialogue Among All 
Branches of Power"] 
  [Text] Recognizing the lack of an alternative to the course 
toward deep reform of social relations, the state, and the 
economy and expressing its readiness for constructive dialogue 
with the president, the executive and judicial branches, and 
social associations, wishing to reach a compromise and agreement 
among the various political forces that reflect the social and 
national interests of the citizens of the republic, and noting 
that the government, by declaring a course toward a market 
economy, is essentially blocking this, which has led to economic 
chaos-- the Supreme Council shall adopt the following statement 
as a basis for its immediate activity: 
<H5>  I </H5>
  The government was unable to develop a national program of 
reforms which could become the basis for the consolidation of 
society, which made it impossible to have constructive 
interaction among the branches of power or to conduct an 
integrated, logically complete legislative policy, as a result 
of which the democratically elected Supreme Council, reflecting 
the will of the majority of the voters as expressed by them at 
numerous pre-election meetings, has been forced to express a 
lack of confidence in the socioeconomic and legal policy of the 
government. 
  In the given situation the only possibility of avoiding 
complete paralysis of power is to have a constructive dialogue 
among all of its branches as well as social and political forces 
in order to create a national program of reforms and to form a 
government capable of carrying it out. 
  Until the adoption of a coordinated program the Supreme 
Council shall focus its attention on the following issues: 
  1. Consideration of the president's edicts adopted in the 
absence of a legislative organ. 
  2. Execution of the budget and approval of the budget for 
the 
next fiscal period. 
  3. Performance of oversight functions. 
  4. International treaties subject to ratification. 
  5. Expansion and strengthening of international ties. 
  6. Consideration of laws adopted on the first reading by the 
Supreme Council of the 12th convocation and returned by the 
president for further discussion. 
<H5>  II </H5>
  The Supreme Council recognizes as a priority the task of 
immediately providing the maximum possible social protection for 
the population and making this protection more targeted and 
effective. 
  The Supreme Council intends: 
  1. To undertake a number of legislative measures for staunch 
support of commodity producers. 
  2. To legislatively limit the authority of the executive 
power to dispose of state property. 
  3. To expand the independence of enterprises with all forms 
of ownership. 
  These measures are needed exclusively to ease the 
consequences of the crisis for the population and the economy, 
to eliminate the unsystematic legislation which is ruinous to 
the state, and to provide for stability of legislation in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan. 
<H5>  III </H5>
  The Supreme Council expresses its hope in the possibility of 
achieving accord among the branches of power and sociopolitical 
forces. 
  The Supreme Council proposes getting started immediately on 
consultations among representatives of the president, the 
Supreme Council, other state organs, political parties, and 
other social associations to work out conditions for working on 
the coordinated reform program. 
  Adopted on 27 May 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Mekhlis Suleymenov, deputy of the Republic of </F>
Kazakhstan Supreme Council and member of the Kazakh Academy of 
Agricultural Sciences: "Why I Withdrew My Candidacy From Three 
Nominations"] 
  [Text] I would not go into explaining my motives for three 
times withdrawing my candidacy from nomination to the post of 
chairman of several Supreme Council committees had it not been 
for T. Kvyatkovskaya's article "Should We Appraise the 
Parliament in Tenge Value?" (ASIYA No. 17, 1994). It said the 
following: "There is no question that Mekhlis Suleymenov, an 
agrarian scientist of international renown, would have been 
elected to the chairmanship of the agrarian committee. His 
candidacy was proposed by the speaker, and he had support among 
both the `right' and the `left.' The most likely explanation for 
this decision is that the scientist found it impossible to give 
up completely his scientific plans and goals." 
  This implies that I was offered the post of agrarian 
committee chairman but refused. I would not want the public to 
see my actions in this light. Therefore, I will discuss it in 
more detail. 
  I arrived in Almaty on the evening of 18 April, that is, the 
night before the first session. In the morning I was told that 
agrarian deputies had already held a meeting with Deputy Prime 
Minister S.V. Kulagin. Among other things, the question of a 
candidate for the post of committee chairman was discussed. Only 
one name was mentioned--that of the former chairman, Yu.M. 
Ilyashenko, who had been elected by the president's list in 
Akmolinsk Oblast. Nobody mentioned my name. 
  On the first day of the Supreme Council's work the agrarian 
deputies held their own meeting and discussed the candidacies of 
possible contenders for the post of committee chairman. Among 
the nominated were Yu.M. Ilyashenko; A.K. Yengaliyev, deputy 
head of the West Kazakhstan administration; and K.A. Aubakirov, 
deputy head of Zhambylsk administration. Nobody mentioned my 
name. Therefore, I suggested myself through self-nomination. 
  When various deputy groups began to discuss candidates for 
committee chairmen, I was approached several times. Deputy N. 
offered the following: "We would like to ask you not to compete 
for the agrarian committee. We cannot `take' all the 
committees--we have to give three or four to Russians. We have 
looked it over several times and decided that the agrarian 
committee should go to a Russian--Yu.M. Ilyashenko. You, on the 
other hand, we see as chairman of the science and education 
committee." 
  Then I was approached by Deputy Sh., who advised me: "Why do 
you need the agrarian committee? Your place is at the helm of 
the international relations committee. They will not find a 
better candidate!" 
  Then the agrarians came into the room and said: "Do not go 
to 
other committees under any circumstances; your place is at the 
helm of the agrarian committee!" I also learned that the speaker 
also was inclined to see me in precisely this committee. 
  Therefore, when I was nominated for the chairmanship of the 
international relations committee, I declined the nomination on 
the grounds that I would run for the agrarian committee. It was 
a surprise to me that I was nominated for this post by Supreme 
Soviet Chairman A. Kekilbayev himself. Yu.M. Ilyashenko and K.A. 
Aubakirov were immediately nominated as alternative candidates. 
In the course of the discussion neither the "right" nor the 
"left" supported me. At the same time, support for my rivals was 
as thick as the wall. I was especially upset by two remarks. 
  Deputy F. Kozlov, who before this actively supported the 
candidacy of K. Nagmanov for chairmanship of the industrial 
committee by saying: "I am a Russian, but I urge you to vote for 
a Kazakh!" this time said: "We have already elected the chairmen 
of seven committees, and they are not Russians! Let us finally 
heed the appeal of the president, who asked us to take into 
account, among other things, the ethnic balance in electing the 
Supreme Council leadership!" 
  Deputy Sh. Murtaza expressed the opinion of a considerable 
number of deputies by saying that he sees at the head of this 
committee not a scientist but rather a person who grew up in a 
Kazakh village and knows all its troubles. Naturally I, with my 
"international renown," good English, and so-so Kazakh, did not 
fit the description. 
  After these comments I withdrew my nomination, saying that 
given such a heavy discussion I did not consider it possible to 
continue to compete. 
  Later I was also nominated to the leadership of the science 
and education committee, where U.A. Dzholdasbekov was a clear 
favorite. So I had to give up my claim there as well. 
  As a result I found myself without a portfolio, which I do 
not regret. I was told that I could still be elected because 
some deputies say one thing but vote differently. But I decided 
not to test fate. Now, though, I sit in an office that is four 
times smaller than my director's office. On the other hand, 
there are three of us in it. So I do not get bored.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Gribanov: "The Army of Kazakhstan: </F>
Spring Escapes"] 
  [Text] Almost two years ago, during the period of the 
creation of the Armed Forces of the republic, the views of many 
military men boiled down to the belief that our country would 
come to have one of the strongest armies in the Asia-Pacific 
region. Indeed, Kazakhstan inherited the military districts of 
the Soviet Union that were not the worst. Their geopolitical 
situation made it imperative for the leaders of the USSR to 
continuously monitor the combat readiness of the troops and to 
equip them with the most up-to-date materiel. 
  Present-day judgments concerning the army of Kazakhstan are 
conflicting--from unreserved recognition of its potential 
advantages to sharply worded criticism of the government for 
squandering the people's money to maintain "toy" troops. 
Clarifying the real situation in the army turned out to be a 
difficult affair. The endless red tape on the part of employees 
of the press center of the Ministry of Defense who must ensure 
liaison between the military and the press suddenly ran into the 
impenetrable fence of military and state secrets. 
  Nonetheless, Major General Sabit Taulanov, chief of the 
cadre 
directorate of the military department, acknowledged that it is 
premature to refer to high combat readiness on the part of the 
army of Kazakhstan. However, in case of need, the residents of 
Kazakhstan will be protected by ground forces, the Air Force, 
the Air Defense Troops, and, strange as it may sound, the Navy. 
This service, which is new for our republic, importunately 
conjures up the children's joke about "a submarine on the 
steppes of Kazakhstan" and for now is represented solely by the 
Naval Department of the Ministry of Defense. Kazakhstan does not 
have any submarines yet; however, there is hope that in the 
future military vessels of the republic will ply the expanse of 
the Caspian Sea. 
  In the opinion of General Taulanov, problems in the 
republic's army began because of non-Kazakh officers leaving the 
country. According to data from the Ministry of Defense, the 
shortage of officers in the Army as of now comes to 30 percent. 
However, according to data received through unofficial channels, 
the actual cadre shortage exceeds 50 percent. It is no secret 
that an overwhelming majority of officers who served on the soil 
of Kazakhstan spoke Russian. They have been leaving for Ukraine, 
Russia, and Belarus. Nobody is holding them back. Most of the 
officers left because of beggarly pay and social and housing 
problems which had gone unsolved for years. 
  The junior command echelon (from lieutenant to major) has 
been particularly thinned out, that is, precisely those whose 
duty it is to make new recruits into soldiers and directly lead 
them. They are trying to fill the void by using the higher 
military command school in Almaty, the only one in Kazakhstan. 
It graduates 200-210 young officers a year. Only 53 persons from 
the last class remained in the republic. The rest of the 
non-Kazakh officers left for their native parts. Previously, the 
school graduated only motorized infantry personnel; now, motor 
vehicle, artillery, and tank personnel train next to them. In 
the new school year, logistics and engineering cadets will be 
added. In addition, the total number of those admitted to the 
school will increase by a factor of two. Diversification is a 
good thing, but unfortunately, under our conditions quantity 
seldom turns into quality. The Ministry of Defense sees the 
annual assignment of 450 residents of Kazakhstan for study at 
the military schools of Russia as the next scenario for the 
replenishment of the lost officer cadres. However, the 
difficulty is that our cadets are frequently expelled from the 
schools. It is likely that insufficient level of knowledge, 
large distances from home, and complications in mutual relations 
are factors. Besides, there are no guarantees that, having 
become an officer, a cadet from Kazakhstan will not remain in 
Russia to serve. 
  Following many years of oblivion, short military courses of 
the "takeoff + landing = officer" kind have been resurrected in 
our country. National Hero of Kazakhstan Sagadat Nurmagambetov, 
minister of defense of our republic, began his military career 
in similar courses during the war years. From the history of the 
war we also remember how latter-day lieutenants led soldiers 
into battle after two months of training, were the first to 
perish, and left the rest on the ground. 
  A call-up of reserve officers who received their military 
ranks simultaneously with college diplomas for a two-year stint 
became the last trump card played by military officials. Some 
1,500 "students," strictly civilians, ended up in the army. They 
are reinforced by 700 volunteers from among reservists. However, 
a majority of both groups do not have the necessary knowledge 
and experience in operating materiel and commanding soldiers. 
  It is necessary to discuss the soldiers and sergeants of the 
Kazakhstan Army. They will and do carry out the orders of their 
officers. General Taulanov maintains that the troops have a 100 
percent complement of enlisted men and sergeants, despite the 
fact that in the last five years the authority of the Army has 
been substantially undermined. Cases of evasion of service and 
absence from units have been reduced to a minimum. To a great 
degree, the fact that residents of Kazakhstan serve for the 
entire 1.5 years only within the republic has contributed to 
this. As far as "dedovshchina" [recruit abuse] is concerned, in 
the opinion of the general, it afflicts "guys who are 
unaccustomed to labor and do not wish to accomplish the assigned 
tasks. This prompts fellow servicemen to physically influence 
disobedient ones." 
  We believe that not everything is that simple within the 
community of soldiers. Inductees begin to experience their first 
problems in military commissariats during examinations by 
medical commissions. Colonel Galim Aldamzharov, deputy military 
commissar of Almaty and the capital city oblast, states that 
according to the findings of physicians, one in three draftees 
is unfit to serve. Their weight falls 20-25 kilograms short. 
They are afflicted with intestinal disease, tuberculosis, and a 
bunch of other conditions. 
  Employees of military medical commissions admit that they 
are 
pressured in certain military commissariats, and a certain 
proportion of the "unfit" are put in the ranks of soldiers. It 
is precisely of unhealthy soldiers that the first group of 
escapees, deserters, and military criminals is comprised. The 
second group consists of those who, according to the general, do 
not wish to carry out commanders' orders. These guys are not 
prepared for service either physically or morally. We cannot 
help thinking of the system of school-based and pre-induction 
training. It was also destroyed in the heat of "disarmament." 
The third group consists of "martinets," the mainstay of 
"dedovshchina," mainly sergeants and second-year servicemen. 
They establish their own rules in view of the reluctance and 
inability of officers to discharge their official 
responsibilities. 
  According to data from a well-informed source, the number of 
crimes committed by servicemen keeps growing. Based on the 
totals for last year, in the capital city oblast alone more than 
500 criminal cases were instituted, including those involving 
particularly dangerous crimes. Some 320 servicemen left places 
of service without official leave; 118 of them have already been 
convicted, and the search is on for the rest. 
  The issue of omitting Article 232 of the Criminal Code 
(absence without official leave) which draws up to two years of 
disciplinary battalion for the escapee is being worked on. 
Otherwise a good proportion of the Army would trade in barracks 
for cells. A one-month disciplinary confinement to the 
guardhouse is proposed as an alternative. 
  The combat readiness of all armies is judged not only on the 
basis of the strength of troops but also on the results of army 
exercises. In the two years of existence of the Kazakhstan Army 
not a single large-scale exercise has been held. They have 
restricted themselves to command post exercises, unit commander 
training, and end-of-training performance evaluations. The 
Ministry of Defense is inclined to associate this fact with 
difficulties in forming the Armed Forces of the republic. 
However, other reasons making it impossible to conduct such 
exercises are also apparent. Between December 1991 and May 1992 
a power vacuum prevailed in the former Union army. The Union no 
longer existed, republic armies did not yet exist. In the words 
of many military men, this period was sufficient for once 
menacing districts to be stripped. Weapon depots were plundered, 
elements of air defense and space surveillance systems were 
removed. All drugs of any value were removed from the central 
military hospital. 
  Of course, we cannot call the Army of Kazakhstan indigent 
troops. It does have modern combat materiel. Under a military 
treaty with Russia signed this year our Army will be able to 
mitigate a weapons shortage. This is necessary and advantageous 
for both sides. However, use of weapons needs to be learned. 
Meanwhile, trainers are clearly in short supply.

<F P=106> [Interview with N. Isingarin, by GUDOK correspondent T. </F>
Shirshova, Alma-Ata, under rubric "On the Commonwealth's Main 
Lines": "Seeing the Prospects"] 
  [Text] The Kazakhstan republic's Ministry of 
Transportation was the scene of a meeting between Transportation 
Minister N. Isingarin and representatives of the branch press: 
three railroad newspapers and a GUDOK correspondent. The 
participants in the meeting touched upon various questions 
pertaining to the current status and prospects for developing 
the railroads of Kazakhstan. We were publishing that 
conversation today. 
  [Shirshova] Nigmatzhan Kabatayevich, could you please 
discuss 
the state of affairs on the republic's railroads? Does the 
branch correspond completely to today's requirements? 
  [Isingarin] If one speaks about our railroads immediately 
after the collapse of the Union, during that period they were 
capable of providing for the necessary volume of freight and 
passenger shipments. It was also impossible to complain about 
the rate to which they were provided with equipment, since, 
beginning in the 1970's, there was active development of 
Kazakhstan's main lines, especially the Virginland Railroad. But 
after the break in the economic ties among the former union 
republics, certain shortcomings were revealed. 
  The configuration of our railroad network does not 
correspond 
to the internal railroad-car flow. For example, the republic's 
center is not linked with the western rayons of the republic. 
The economy, under conditions of sovereignty, requires the 
development of those structures which, when Kazakhstan was part 
of the Union, would not have been given the go-ahead, since 
there was no need for that. For example, today the petroleum-gas 
industry is developing in West Kazakhstan. But in specifically 
that part of the republic there is no capability of organizing 
rail shipments in full volume. 
  Could we have previously built a petroleum refinery in 
Aktau? 
I would scarcely think so, since we got our petroleum products 
from Russia. 
  After the separation, Kazakhstan's railroad workers proved 
to 
be without the industrial base that they needed. And currently 
not a single finished article is being produced in our republic 
to meet the needs of railroad transportation. That is the main 
problem today! 
  In addition, railroad transportation has proven to be not 
ready for the changed trends in passenger flows. Previously even 
the people on business trips were sent basically to Moscow. But 
currently the number of passengers leaving Alma-Ata and going to 
Alma-Ata has doubled. The volume of shipments within the 
republic has increased. But our pool of passenger cars has 
become obsolete, they are wearing out, and there is simply a 
catastrophic shortage of them. And so we simply cannot carry 
approximately 20-25 percent of our potential passengers. 
  Because of the break in the economic ties and the failure to 
receive payments, there has been an increase in the freight 
shipments within the republic. Previously the virgin lands 
received petroleum products from Omsk and Tomsk, and last year 
they came from Guryev. East Kazakhstan and Semipalatinsk Oblast 
used to receive coal from Kuzbass, but currently we bring it in 
from the Shubarkul deposit (Kazakhstan), that is, a distance 
that is twice as long as previously. 
  There has arisen a problem with improving the system of 
administering rail transportation in the republic, because the 
previous union scientific and normative base has been lost. 
  [Shirshova] How, then, will the branch develop in the 
future? 
  [Isingarin] Most probably Kazakhstan's rail transportation 
will be constructed according to the Russian model. Therefore we 
are attempting to preserve close ties with the RF MPS [Ministry 
of Railroads]. This is expressed in a number of agreements that 
were signed by Kazakhstan Mintrans [Ministry of Transportation] 
and MPS. We support branch publications -- the ZHELEZNODOROZHNYY 
TRANSPORT magazine and GUDOK newspaper. 
  Incidentally, GUDOK once published an article in which, in 
particular, it was mentioned that Isingarin is dreaming of 
creating an MPS of the Commonwealth countries. That is true. And 
I shall even add that I proposed creating a company on the scale 
of the CIS -- "Gruzovoy Vagon -- 1520"-- in order to unite all 
the railroad-car pools and to create on their basis an 
intergovernmental structure in which each country would be a 
shareholder with its own railroad cars, but in which there would 
be a single repair base and a single system for regulating the 
pools. But nothing has happened yet. The politicians are still 
holding onto their sovereignty, even if it harms the situation. 
  Currently I am proposing creating from the Commonwealth's 
railroads a transnational railroad company with a single 
scientific-technical policy and a single leadership. The people 
of Kazakhstan are ready to forgo a certain part of their 
sovereignty for this purpose. But we shall all be winners since 
we shall not create our own scientific-technical base in each 
country. 
  The transnational company could be created on the basis of 
the Russian MPS, but so far the CIS countries are probably not 
ready for this idea. Although the European Community's 
Commission on Transportation already is a kind of ministry for 
Europe's transportation. 
  But for the time being the situation is forcing us to think 
about independent steps. We are uniting our own scientific 
forces, and with the aid of the Russian Academy of 
Transportation we are creating a national scientific center. 
Much is being done in our republic to manufacture spare parts. 
The steel-casting plant in Pavlodar produces parts for automatic 
couplers, and the motor-vehicle repair association in Alma-Ata 
produces elements for attaching reinforced-concrete ties. We 
have to produce 30-40 percent of the spare parts that we need. 
  Currently we are also creating a plant base for repairing 
equipment. We shall also produce certain things, for example, 
passenger cars. For this purpose we intend to increase our 
business relations with Germany, Russia, and Turkey. 
  Today we are unable to carry all the passengers across West 
Kazakhstan, and we also have a complicated situation with such 
shipments in the south of the republic. It is necessary to 
create new routes, and to make a number of trains daily ones. 
For this purpose we are attempting to purchase a hundred 
passenger cars in Germany. 
  [Shirshova] What is the rate policy on the railroad main 
lines? 
  [Isingarin] The rates are regulated by the state. Everyone 
thinks that the railroad workers must not suffer any losses from 
the shipments, but at the same time the republic is experiencing 
a sharp increase in the prices of energy carriers, although in 
our republic they will soon exceed the worldwide prices. But if 
there is another rise, the railroad workers will also be forced 
to raise the rate for shipments. This will impact upon the 
clientele. And the raising of the prices of their output will 
lead to the ruination of the railroads themselves. So everyone 
has to behave very cautiously. 
  [Shirshova] A problem that is no less urgent today is the 
problem of nonpayments. What are the railroad workers 
undertaking in order to get the money that is owed to them? 
Aren't they suffocating from their debts? 
  [Isingarin] At one time the Kazakhstan government made the 
decision: no freight would be shipped without prepayment. But 
currently, one after another, decisions are being made that 
require the railroad workers to ship without prepayment, whether 
it be coal, or grain, or gas for the population. 
  As of today, we are owed 1.5 billion tenge. At the 
same time we ourselves have become debtors. The Virginland 
Railroad, for example, owes Russia almost 200 billion rubles. 
All this has led to a situation in which the railroad workers 
have been forced to accept output as a form of payment on 
account, to pay for the shipments. For example, it was decided 
that half the Ekibastuz coal that is en route to Russia should 
be channeled into paying off the miners' indebtedness to the 
railroad workers. We shall transfer that money to the Russian 
MPS in order to pay off our debts. The Kazakhstan government 
supports this kind of reciprocal settlement: there is no other 
alternative. 
  [Shirshova] How have the market and the new relations had an 
effect on the operation of transportation? 
  [Isingarin] Railroad workers were among the first in the 
republic to sense sharply the uncontrollability of the market. 
The volume of shipments dropped by one-half. Recently we 
resolved the question of preferential payment for them. If the 
customer has money for prepayment and has freight, the railroad 
workers guarantee to him that he will receive shipment benefits. 
We want to attract freight in this way. 
  [Shirshova] Do the railroad workers have any hope of getting 
money in exchange for shipments? I am talking about indebtedness 
to three railroads of 1.5 billion tenge. 
  [Isingarin] At the present time there is a republic-wide 
reciprocal offset. If it proves to be possible to carry it out 
intelligently, the railroad workers will be able to count on 
success. Starting in February of last year, the railroad workers 
have been attempting to get payment of shipments without invoice 
acceptance, but they have been unsuccessful... 
  [Shirshova] We like to make parallels with the state of 
transportation abroad. But the countries in the near abroad give 
their railroads subsidies for their development. Can the 
Kazakhstan railroad workers count on this? 
  [Isingarin] Only a rich country can give subsidies. As you 
know, the republic's budget at this moment is in a very 
difficult situation. There won't be any subsidies. In addition, 
railroad transportation, unlike many other branches in 
Kazakhstan, is currently operating at a profit. The only problem 
is that the profit drowns in the reciprocal debts. 
  [Shirshova] Will the existing system of administering rail 
transportation be preserved? 
  [Isingarin] We have already discussed among ourselves 
various 
alternatives and have decided that, at this stage, it is more 
desirable to preserve the existing system of administration. 
When the economy settles down, the questions of 
material-technical supply are resolved, and the market 
requirements are defined, then we shall also improve the 
administrative system. 
  If one speaks about the economics of railroads, the 
reduction 
in shipments will continue for many years. We shall not return 
to the volumes of the 1980's in the foreseeable future. In 
addition, there has been an intensification of labor. Even if, 
within, say, 20 years, we do return to that volume of shipments 
that we used to have, we shall cope with it with a much smaller 
continent of workers. Our hope is to open two new international 
through-shipment main lines: the Trans-Asian and the Eurasian 
main lines. 
  [Shirshova] Today China is worried about the rise in prices 
for through shipments by way of Kazakhstan. There is less 
freight than one would like. What is the reason for this? 
  [Isingarin] The Chinese railroad workers are waiting things 
out. They are building 1620 kilometers of second tracks between 
Urumchi and Lanchow. As soon as the construction is completed in 
1995, a broad exit will immediately open up for a flow of 
freight, and it is our task not to create any barriers to this 
flow, either in the form of customs barriers or rate barriers. 
It is necessary for us to think about how, in the year 2000, we 
can guarantee the shipments of freight from China in a volume of 
10 million tons, of which 5 million will be by rail. I feel that 
we must be able to carry the same number of millions in the 
direction of Turkey and Iran. If that through shipment occurs, 
the volume of work will undoubtedly increase and this will 
simultraneous resolve a number of problems linked with personnel 
downsizing, earnings, etc.

<F P=106> [KAZTAG report: "Before Starting an Offensive Against Crime, </F>
the Workers of Law Enforcement Organs Plan To Bring Order to 
Their Own Ranks"] 
  [Text] A meeting of the republic's council to fight crime 
was held on 25 May. The leaders of a number of ministries and 
departments were invited to it. Kairbek Suleymenov, a state 
adviser, gave a report. 
  The speaker noted that a lot of criticism is being directed 
against the president and the government for the state of crime. 
But few take upon themselves the work of analyzing how 
consistently measures are being carried out that are directed at 
strengthening law and order and legality. For example, necessary 
changes to legislation are being made effectively. Work is 
coming to a conclusion on the adoption of a crime and a criminal 
procedure code. A state program of legal reforms is being 
implemented. Organizational measures set forth in the anticrisis 
program and the program to fight crime in 1993-1995 have been 
implemented in many ways through edicts and decrees of the 
president and decisions of the government. In a word, there is a 
legal basis for strengthening the fight against crime in the 
republic. And the references of executives of law enforcement 
organs to its absence only indicates their unprofessionalism and 
poor understanding of the situation, and their elementary legal 
ignorance. 
  The speaker recalled that the February 1992 decrees of the 
president proposed to discharge those who were unable to cope 
with their duties from the positions they occupied. However, 
there has been no work in this direction to the present day. It 
is not a question of firing personnel, but it is no longer 
possible to condone the obvious idleness of individual workers. 
A good third of the officials on the job are of no use, but the 
departmental chiefs resigned themselves to this a long time ago. 
In the last two years, just in the MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs], 636 extraordinary incidents and 380 violations of the 
law were committed, and 215 officials were convicted for various 
crimes. Four thousand and seven hundred and sixty-six persons 
were discharged for unfavorable reasons. The offensive against 
crime will not start until strict order is established in the 
system of law enforcement and judicial organs itself. 
  The economic services of the MVD are not working 
effectively, 
where under the slogan of healthy competition they actually 
continue to duplicate each other and where various organs work 
on trivia. 
  In summing up what was said, Kairbek Suleymenov declared 
that 
in individual oblasts whole subunits have not given any results 
for years, and a good half of the officials of the economic 
services of the MVD are not worth their salt, and no one is in a 
position to compel them to work on important matters. The 
solution, in the opinion of the state adviser, is to unite these 
services and to conduct a tough objective report on the 
efficiency of the personnel. 
  The protection of public order is also organized with poor 
results. The meager means of the budget are frequently spent on 
computer equipment, which later rusts in storehouses. Acquired 
motor vehicles are used by thousands of chiefs of all ranks for 
personal purposes, but not for patrolling by mobile militia 
groups. 
  It has also become the norm for the courts to examine cases 
with a violation of dates. The Procuracy continues to engage in 
writing concepts that are not read by anyone and in senseless 
checks on the state of lawfulness. Cases of liberalism toward 
dangerous criminals on the part of the courts have become 
general. The Ministry of Justice does not have continuous 
effective information about punitive practice. 
  Kairbek Suleymenov also said, in particular, that the 
distinguishing feature of criminal tension is the theft of 
firearms and ammunition in military units. In the last two years 
and four months, more than 1,300 firearms items were stolen, 
including 160 assault rifles and more than 500 pistols. In this 
same period, 2,059 rifle barrels were confiscated from the 
population, including 91 assault rifles and 825 pistols. 
Firearms were employed in the commission of 2,465 crimes. 
  The state adviser proposed to carry out an action of the 
voluntary surrender of firearms and ammunition, which will 
promote an improvement in the situation. 
  Taking part in the discussion of the report were Minister of 
Internal Affairs Vladimir Shumov, Procurator General of the 
Republic Zharmakhan Tuyakbayev, KNB [National Security 
Committee] Deputy Chairman Zhenisbek Zhumanbekov, Deputy 
Minister of Defense Valeriy Sapsay, and Commander of Internal 
Troops Aleksey Filistovich. 
  The result of the discussion of the question was the 
adoption 
of a protocol decision directed at reinforcing the fight against 
crime and strengthening legality in the republic.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Meetings in the Turkmen Land"] </F>
  [Text] On 27 May 1994 the President of Turkmenistan 
S. Niyazov received G. Fadeyev, chairman of the Council on Rail 
Transportation of the CIS Countries and RF Minister of 
Railways. 
  B. Sardzhayev, deputy chairman of the Turkmen Cabinet 
of Ministers, and Kh. Khalykov, chief of the Turkmen State 
Railway, took part in the conversation. 
  The minister informed the President of Turkmenistan of the 
work done by the Council on Rail Transportation to coordinate 
the activities of railroads on the interstate level. 
Preservation of the technological uniformity of the rail network 
of the former USSR was noted as an important result of the 
Council's work. 
  The President of Turkmenistan had high praise for the role 
of 
the Council on Rail Transportation in supporting the transport 
of freight and passengers in the interests of the economic and 
social development of all the member states of the CIS and the 
Baltic countries. He noted the need for further consolidation of 
cooperation among railroads, in particular the railroads of the 
Russian Federation and Turkmenistan. 
  Turkmenistan is devoting a great deal of attention to the 
creation of rail transport corridors, which are important not 
only for the particular region but also for Russia and the other 
countries of the CIS. They have in mind construction of new rail 
lines from Tedzhen through Seraks to Meshkhed and from 
Gazandzhik to Gyzyletrek; these lines will provide the shortest 
route to Iran and on to the Persian Gulf for freight from 
Russia's eastern regions, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan as well as 
for international transit freight. 
  Salarmurat Niyazov stressed that the doors are open for 
mutually advantageous cooperation by all interested states in 
carrying out these projects. As for Russia, a joint working 
group has been formed on the basis of the protocol of the talks 
between the RF minister of railways and the chief of the Turkmen 
State Railway to study the set of questions related to Russian 
participation in building the above-named rail lines. As the 
result of its work, which should be completed before 1 September 
of this year, proposals will be prepared for the governments of 
Russia and Turkmenistan. 
  The support of the RF Ministry of Railways for the formative 
process and efficient operation of Turkmenistan's independent 
railway was noted as part of the development of bilateral 
Russian-Turkmen cooperation. At this meeting questions of 
improving the quality of transportation ties between Russian and 
Turkmenistan were also discussed. 
  In conclusion the President of Turkmenistan wished the 
participants of the 11th meeting of the Council on Rail 
Transportation good results and successful implementation of the 
decisions adopted in the interests of further development of 
mutually advantageous cooperation.

<F P=106> [Article by Namoz Mamatkulov, secretary of the Erk Party </F>
Surkhondaryo Oblast Council: "The National Movement Is 
Undivided"] 
  [Text] One of the facts of the perestroyka movement was 
national awakening. The struggle for independence in the 
colonial republics is a direct continuation of this national 
awakening movement. As long as the Union was preserved, it is 
clear that basic democratic reform in some of the republics was 
not implemented. 
  Thus, there was a need for a political organization with a 
national orientation in Uzbekistan. The Erk Democratic Party 
came to the fore to fill this need. From the time the party was 
formed it set for itself the goal of national independence and 
used its power in this direction. On the foundation of the 
earlier national awakening and this movement, basic reform in 
society was the path selected by Erk. 
  Viewed from this point of view, it was natural that the 
national aim was not to move toward the literal concept of 
"democracy" accepted in the West. Forces not completely 
understanding the meaning of this began to take aim at Erk from 
various directions the day it was founded. 
  On one hand, representatives of the totalitarian regime 
placed obstacles in its way (this is why the party was not 
officially registered for a long time), and on the other, 
radical communists who had suddenly become "democrats" attacked 
it. 
  Perestroyka was brought about through the dismantling of the 
empire, and its colonialized people attained national liberation. 
  Under this historical situation, communists who had turned 
into "democrats," including representatives of the Birlik 
movement such as Abdurayim Polatov, completely repudiated the 
goal of independence; "we will not separate from Moscow: If we 
separate from Moscow, we will be unable to attain democracy," 
they claimed. 
  However, the healthy part of the Birlik movement was 
together 
with the Erkists in this struggle. The majority of the members 
of this movement joined the ranks of Erk. This became especially 
evident during the referendum held to preserve the Union. 
  Under existing circumstances the forming of democratic 
traditions in the concept of a nation and in society became a 
regular duty. Thus the Erk party, as a constructive opposition, 
opted for the parliamentary way of democratic struggle, in other 
words, entering the government through the electoral process. In 
the Baltic republics, representatives of the national movement 
came into the government by means of elections, also. 
  On the basis of the plan and struggle of the Erk party, the 
passing of the Declaration of Independence at the Supreme 
Council of Uzbekistan and the participation of Muhammad Solih, 
the founder and chairman of the party, in the presidential 
elections was an expression of this goal. These actions 
undoubtedly raised the political understanding of the nation. 
  After the elections the party continued its path of 
struggle, 
and ERK, its press organ, continued to cast light on events in 
the Republic although it was placed under merciless censorship. 
  Erk did not stop at this. It gave precedence to the people's 
interests and its own suggestions, and struggled to introduce 
these into the direction of the government. 
  Forces in favor of strengthening democratic principles in 
the 
government began to group around Erk and the Forum of Democratic 
Forces of Uzbekistan was formed. Birlik also joined this Forum. 
Birlik cochairmen and activists Bek Toshmuhamedov, Gulchehra 
Nurullayeva, Dadakhon Hasan, and others demonstrated that Erk 
was firmly on the road. Not only did the government oppose the 
formation and activity of the Forum, but also the Polatovs, 
whose goal and struggle was unknown. 
  Individuals who attach the title of "democrats" to 
themselves 
like Abdurayim Polatov, who was then and is now a communist, 
have found no other function than denigrating the Erk party. For 
example, it is sometimes forgotten that Polatov, who calls 
himself a "democrat" and yelled "Down with communism!", was 
secretary of the Communist Party's primary party organization at 
the Cybernetics Institute where he worked. 
  I was never a communist, but if I had been, I would have 
been 
ashamed at yelling something like that. 
  After the Istiklol Yoli [Independence Road] Party was 
founded, I expressed my opinion about this on Radio Liberty. In 
response, Abdurayim Polatov, in a radio interview, said that he 
was glad and the government was also glad that two traitors had 
left the Erk party. 
  Polatov lied when he said in his interview that "Erk was 
founded before the parliamentary elections of 1990." In the 
first place, the 1990 parliamentary elections took place in 
February 1990. As for the Erk party, it was founded in April 
1990. And Muhammad Solih was not elected to parliament in his 
capacity as party chairman, but as a writer and public servant 
known to the people. 
  Polatov has accused Erk of being in the constructive 
opposition. Yes, we are a party of constructive opposition now 
and in the future. We are different from the "shadow parties," 
which declare the government's line to be their own line, and 
the radical communists, who lack both their own line and 
proposals for one. The Erk party has a clear program in every 
sector and concrete proposals which it has stated to the 
government in every sector. We are fighting to apply this 
program to life. 
  If we come to the allegation of Abdurayim Polatov, the only 
reason for this is that he is jealous of the Erk party, because 
when Erk was organized in April 1990 he himself was struggling 
to organize a party. He named it the Birlik party. But the 
majority of Birlikists refused to join it. 
  The basic democratic forces today are grouped around Erk, 
and 
the party, under the present serious conditions, is acting in 
solidarity with all progressive forces in the Republic. Our 
friends, who know themselves to be true Birlikists, are fighting 
shoulder to shoulder with us. 
  Following the last party congress, democratically inclined 
religious officials, who had wavered earlier, joined our 
struggle. Their activity has been a great help to us since the 
Erk party wants our nation to be formed as a nation of high 
principle. 
  There are those who do not recognize this unity movement. 
But 
there are more who do than do not. They are the Uzbek people.

<F P=106> [Article by Yu. Ryazhentsev, under the rubric "Looking to </F>
the Upcoming Session of the Republic Supreme Soviet": 
"Guarantees for Investors Are Guarantees of Success in 
Attracting Foreign Capital to Priority Sectors of the Uzbekistan 
Economy"] 
  [Text] The draft Law on Foreign Investment and 
Guarantees for the Activity of Foreign Investors is being 
broadly discussed in Uzbekistan business circles. There is great 
interest in it. 
  There is, of course, a Law on Foreign Investment in 
effect in our republic. What is new and different in the 
proposed draft law? This was the subject of our conversation 
with S. Kh. Abdurakhimov, chief of the Administration of 
Analysis and Expert Examination of Investment Plans of the 
National Bank of Foreign Economic Activity, and Sh. A. 
Ishankhodzhayeva, chief of the financial-economic analysis 
department of this institution. 
  "If we provide reliable guarantees for the activities of 
foreign investors," says Saidakbar Khodzhiakbarovich, "then you 
can say that we will open up a broad way into our republic for 
foreign capital. There is a distinction here between the 
already-mentioned draft law and the present one. The draft law 
put the very important point about guarantees for the activity 
of foreign investors in a special heading. 
  "To understand the essential features of the proposed draft 
law better it has to be viewed together with the other laws, 
draft laws, and governmental directives concerning questions of 
foreign investment in the economy. Above all I would like to 
recall the recent decree of the Cabinet of Ministers entitled 
'Measures To Ensure Insurance Protection for Investments in the 
Republic of Uzbekistan,' under which the Uzbekinvest National 
Insurance Company is formed. Its assets will be placed in 
first-class foreign banks. This will provide a reliable 
guarantee of insurance coverage for foreign and domestic 
investments. 
  "In the present state of the reforms it is especially 
important for this insurance company to cover political risks. 
Incidentally, it is precisely political stability that attracts 
foreign investors to our republic. The investor must be 
absolutely confident that he will be able to recover the capital 
invested in the matter with profit under any conditions, 
independent of the current political situation. For our 
partners, therefore, the formation of Uzbekinvest opens great 
prospects. A business can be promoted confidently, in complete 
safety. After all, although Uzbekinvest is a state company, its 
insurance fund can be used at the stipulated moment for 
insurance payments to investors at the decision of the 
supervisory council, formed of the managers of first-class banks 
in various countries. 
  "In this way a reliable protective mechanism is created, a 
system to insure property against expropriation and also against 
any kind of administrative measures that harm the interests of 
investors." 
  "It must be said," Shakhnoz Agzamovna Ishankhodzhayeva 
continues the conversation, "that the draft Law on Foreign 
Investment and Guarantees of the Activities of Foreign Investors 
gives clear definitions of the meaning of foreign borrowing and 
investment and a classification of foreign debts, government 
guarantees, and the like. And here is what I would like to note. 
During discussion of the most recent version of this draft law 
there were significantly fewer criticisms, which indicates good 
cooperation between the authors of the law and the consultants 
from interested departments. 
  "For example, questions related to foreign investment are 
today regulated by a whole set of legislative acts. But there 
was no bankruptcy law. The investor, though, must know exactly 
the conditions under which an economic unit or natural person 
can be judged bankrupt on a legal basis. And here the draft Law 
on Bankruptcy proposed to the session has a definition of the 
elements of bankruptcy. Civil liability is stipulated for 
persons whose improper actions lead to bankruptcy. Thus, the 
draft laws submitted for the session are one more practical step 
by us on the path to creating a market economy. After all, the 
set of laws and draft laws that are already in effect are 
directed to creating favorable conditions for the production of 
export products that meet the highest world standards and to 
creating a protective mechanism for investors." 
  Because the National Bank of Foreign Economic Activity 
specialists took an active part in preparing the draft laws on 
foreign investment, I asked them to talk about some of the 
specific details which, if it can be put this way, have created 
obstacles in practical affairs. And I learned that it was in 
fact the bank specialists who proposed creating conditions to 
increase the flow of cash for investment projects during the 
period of credit repayment. They consistently defend the need to 
create conditions for investors so that the profit norm in our 
country is better not only for foreign entrepreneurs but also 
for domestic ones.

44.9 million hectares of territory in Uzbekistan the area of 
irrigated lands is about 4.2 million, while pastures used in 
agricultural production account for 22 million hectares. 
  Desert pasturelands account for 82 percent of the total 
balance of agricultural lands in Uzbekistan. In recent years 
more than 9.2 million sheep have been kept on them, including 
5.1 million karakul sheep, as well as more than 823,000 goats 
and several thousand camels. In addition to receiving karakul 
lamb hides pasture sheep herding in the desert produces tens of 
thousands of tons of meat and wool each year. The enormous role 
of this sector in the republic economy is perfectly obvious. 
  In recent decades the anthropogenic impact on desert zones 
has been increasingly felt. This is reflected first of all in 
the water arteries of the arid territories. As an analysis that 
was made indicates, the primary rivers of the desert--the 
Amudarya, Zarafshan, and Kashkadarya--are contaminated to one 
degree or another. Phenols, petroleum products, pesticides, and 
other elements have been detected in river waters. Contamination 
of water around the large cities has increased especially in 
connection with the discharges of industrial enterprises. 
  In the large cities ecology problems are linked primarily 
with the growing concentration of production. Contamination of 
the natural environment of rural settlements is somewhat 
different. As a rule there are no large industrial enterprises 
in the towns and villages, the density of housing construction 
is three-five times less, transportation arteries are less 
dense, and there is lower overall saturation with motor 
vehicles. But the ecological situation around towns and villages 
has also been worsening in recent times. The impact of the city 
on the environment is manifested in development of nearby land 
for suburban gardens, recreation zones, trunk transportation 
routes, and the like. But it is seen particularly in pollution 
from industrial discharges into the atmosphere and streams. The 
greatest anthropogenic stress falls on the most heavily 
settle--but small in land area--Chimbayskiy Rayon in 
Karakalpakia and the Khorezm region. 
  So intensive development of the desert pasture territory of 
Uzbekistan intensified the anthropogenic stress on the desert 
ecosystems of our republic. We need to determine the precise 
data on the location and chemical composition of underground 
waters, the efficiency of methods of opening up underground 
waters by drilling wells, transporting water with pumping 
pipelines and in tankers, the use of small desalinization units 
to supply water to the population, improving techniques of 
freshening mineralized springs with atmospheric precipitation, 
and ways to raise water using electrical drive operating on wind 
and solar energy. It is essential for regeneration of the desert 
pasture zone to compile a long-range prognosis of the 
intensification of desertification under the anthropogenic 
influence, broken down by physico-geographic regions. And the 
approach to further development of land resources within 
geosystems should be differentiated here and city planning 
policies must be straightened out with due regard for how 
favorable the ecological situation is and the degree of 
anthropogenic stress on their territories. 
  Therefore it is especially important and fundamental--both 
for its ecological and its economic significance--to put on the 
agenda of the upcoming session of the Supreme Soviet discussion 
of amendments and additions to certain legislative enactments of 
the Republic of Uzbekistan in connection with adoption of the 
Law on Environmental Protection and the Law on Specially 
Protected Natural Areas.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Put Energy Resources under Reliable </F>
Protection!"] 
  [Text] A meeting of the commission on saving 
fuel-energy resources was held at the Cabinet of Ministers of 
the Republic of Uzbekistan under the chairmanship of first 
deputy prime minister I. Kh. Dzhurabekov. 
  Participants in the meeting were the deputies of the 
chairman 
of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Karakalpakstan, 
the khokims [administrators] of the oblasts and the city of 
Tashkent, and the heads of ministries, departments, concerns, 
corporations, and associations. 
  The question of the situation with execution of the laws 
directed to ensuring preservation and rational use of petroleum 
products in the sectors of the agroindustrial and construction 
complexes was reviewed. 
  Inspections conducted by the republic procurator's office 
and 
its organs in the local areas with participation by specialists 
showed that measures are being taken at the farms and in the 
administrative apparatuses of the Ministry of Water Management, 
the Ministry of Agriculture, the state concerns Uzvodstroy 
[Hydro Construction], Uzplodoovoshchvinprom 
[Fruit-Vegetable-Grape Industry], and Uzpishcheprom [Food 
Industry], Uzglavstroydrevprom [Main Administration of 
Construction in the Wood Processing Industry], and the 
Tashkentstroy [Tashkent Construction] State Corporation to stop 
mismanagement in the storage, transportation, and use of 
petroleum products. This reduced the number of violations of the 
law in the use of fuel and lubricants. At the same time the 
proper measures are not always taken with guilty parties. As the 
result of connivance on the part of ministries, departments, and 
officials at the farms and enterprises there occur cases or 
irrational use of petroleum products, unsatisfactory 
record-keeping on them, illegal writing off of fuel, poor 
technical condition in petroleum storage facilities, and 
operation of vehicles with malfunctioning speedometers. 
Petroleum products are squandered, stolen, and resold owing to 
the neglected state of record-keeping and relaxed monitoring of 
their preservation. The sources from which petroleum products 
sold by private individuals at speculative prices were obtained 
are not identified. 
  A shortfall of 92,500 liters of various petroleum products 
was found at the petroleum storage facilities of just 17 farms 
in Andizhan, Bukhara, Dzhizak, Surkhandarya, and Navoi oblasts. 
  The practice was followed where the customs services would 
use confiscated petroleum products for their own needs and sell 
them to various organizations instead of turning them in to 
state storage areas in Surkhandarya, Andizhan, and Bukhara 
oblasts. In just the first quarter of this year more than 88 
percent of confiscated petroleum products were used for their 
own needs or sold to customs employees and various organizations. 
  The attention of those at the meeting was called to 
compulsory execution of the Cabinet of Ministers decree entitled 
"Establishing Order in the Sale of Fuel and Lubricants." 
  The decision adopted noted that many heads of ministries, 
concerns, associations, enterprises and organizations, and local 
governmental organs did not draw the proper conclusions from 
decisions adopted earlier and did not fully ensure their 
realization. 
  The question of the use of gas, boiler fuel, and thermal and 
electrical energy at enterprises in Samarkand, Navoi, and 
Tashkent oblasts and the city of Tashkent was examined at the 
meeting. Study of the state of affairs in this sphere identified 
numerous substantial shortcomings, which lead to significant 
losses of gas. 
  In a sample inspection of just 13 percent of the enterprises 
of the above oblasts and the city of Tashkent it was established 
that about 100 million cubic meters of gas is being lost because 
of direct mismanagement. The losses of other types of fuel, 
heat, and electricity are very large. The situation with the use 
of energy-conserving equipment remains unsatisfactory. The 
attention of the executives was directed to the inadequacy of 
the steps being taken on questions of the use of fuel-energy 
resources. 
  It was recommended that the heads of khokim [administrative] 
offices, ministries, and departments review the personal 
responsibility of the officials guilty of offenses in the 
questions reviewed, going as far as discharging them from their 
positions. 
  The commission also examined the question of switching 
diesel 
pumping stations to electric drive. It was noted that 
realization of these measures will make it possible to free a 
significant quantity of diesel fuel. A schedule was approved for 
switching diesel pumping stations to electric drive and 
switching machine irrigation systems to gravity flow watering in 
1994-1995. Steps to realize this program were outlined. 
  Deputy prime ministers of the republic A. Voznenko, K. 
Tulyaganov, M. Usmanov, and K. Khankulov took part in the 
commission meeting.

<F P=106> [Article by Kronid Lybarskiy: "The Agreement [dogovor] on a </F>
Separate Peace"] 
  [Text] And so the race with the elaboration of the 
"Agreement [soglasheniye] on Accord" [soglasiye], which later, 
to the satisfaction of linguistic purists, was transformed into 
an "Agreement" [dogovor] has now been successfully completed. On 
28 April the first 245 signatures were put under the agreement. 
The pompous act for some reason took place in the Georgiyevskiy 
Hall of the Kremlin, which symbolizes Russian military glory, 
although for the declaration of a civic accord, probably, a more 
peaceful place would have been more suitable. 
  After the "Georgiyevskiy [Hall]" celebrations there were 
also 
other ones--on a smaller scale. 
  But of greater significance than any symbolism is the 
essence 
of the matter: What precisely was signed, and who precisely 
signed the agreement. 
<H5>  The Kremlin Has Come Closer to Moncloa </H5>
  It is necessary to say that during the several weeks that 
have passed since the time of the development and publication of 
the first variant of the draft agreement it has changed very 
substantially. The first thing that should be noted in comparing 
a number of intervening variants of the text with the final one 
is the fact that the very structure of the document has changed 
drastically. It has become more "addressed" [adresnyy], as they 
say now. In this sense, it has come to resemble much more the 
pacts of Moncloa. 
  In the original variant, all responsibility and all 
obligations were equally divided between all the participants of 
the agreement. A sort of collective security was established. 
For example, it was provided that all future signatories--from 
the Seventh Day Adventists to "Women of the Navy"--obligated 
themselves "not to allow" either "a reduction of the defense 
ability" or "an irreversible technical lag", and expressed 
complete readiness to carry out "budget compensation to the 
regions." 
  In the signed variant there is already nothing of this. The 
obligations of the parties are formulated sufficiently precisely 
and clearly, above all in what concerns the government and the 
Federal Assembly. Besides that, the points of the agreement to a 
significant degree lost poetic vagueness and began more to 
resemble political obligations. 
  It is especially clear now what the Federal Assembly needs 
to 
do. Almost in every part of the agreement a lengthy list of 
legislative acts is cited which the Council of the Federation 
and the Duma obligate themselves to adopt, moreover, some of 
these laws are quite concrete. This is important, for in the 
meanwhile the new Russian parliament has worked utmost 
ineffectively: Upon the expiration of the parliamentary "100 
days" it was discovered that the deputies have not adopted a 
single substantial law, but only laws regulating and 
"guaranteeing" their own activity. 
  The Federal Assembly now promises to adopt at last a 
constitutional law on the government, civil and land codes, a 
new Codex of Labor Law, laws on free economic zones, on banking 
activity, on the securities market, and on the subsistence wage. 
Also envisaged is the adoption of laws "aimed at the perfection 
of the taxation system." The parliamentarians have also 
promised, however, to adopt at last the budget for the current 
year--for this alone one should give thanks to the "Agreement on 
Accord." 
  Also quite concrete are the obligations of the Federal 
Assembly in connection with the laws on local self-government. 
In other spheres of lawmaking they were formulated in much more 
general form. 
  The promises given in the agreement by the executive 
authority sooner have the character of establishing aims: 
Reduction of inflation, increase of investment activity, 
overcoming the structural deformations of the economy, an active 
social policy, etc. For the time being it is not very clear in 
what manner the government intends to carry all this out. It is 
not that the budget for 1994 presented to the Duma exactly 
during the period of the preparation of the agreement 
contradicted the government obligations in the agreement--both 
of these documents simply exist independently of one another, 
one ouitside the other. 
  We will hope that the government has nevertheless some 
thoughts concerning ways of executing the obligations it has 
taken upon itself. However, for the time being these hopes are 
not too great. Here it is worthwhile to remember that even the 
economic obligations of the Moncloa Pact, assumed in conditions 
of a much more favorable situation, were by no means fully 
carried out. 
  Moreover, the executive authority, one must suppose, 
realizes 
this. Not by chance, literally during the last days before the 
signing of the agreement, a cautious reservation was made to the 
government obligations: They will be carried out by the 
government only "on the basis of the legislation of the Russian 
Federation and within the limits of its powers." Thereby the 
success of the actions of the executive is closely linked to the 
preparedness of the parliament to cooperate with it and with the 
powers it will succeed in receiving. 
  By comparison with the original text, the removal of the 
idea 
of "an economic conference" from it must be recognized as a 
reasonable change. According to the original idea of the 
authors, such a conference was to have worked out "coordinated 
proposals in the sphere of economic policy." It was proposed to 
include representatives of both the executive and the 
legislative power, as well as trade unions and entrepreneurs. 
The parties, too, made known their claims to participation in 
the economic conference. One can imagine to what paralysis in 
the course of economic reforms the creation of such an organ 
would lead--an evident next "talking-shop." 
  Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning one circumstance here: 
On the whole, in their majority, the government economic 
obligations are in the channel of market reforms. The authors of 
the document succeeded in resisting the pressure which, without 
a doubt, was exerted on them in the direction of the 
"socialization" of the agreement. Thereby the agreement fixes 
the attained political-economic level of the reforms and does 
not permit restoration tendencies, which, evidently, also made 
it unacceptable to the "red" opposition. 
  This is very important. Any accord must nevertheless have 
some central point, a base foundation, which is not called into 
question by either one of the sides. Today, the recognition of 
the fact that a change in the social system has taken place in 
our country can be and has actually become such a foundation. 
Already this alone makes the "Agreement on Accord" an important 
document. 
  The obligations of the trade unions reduce themselves, in 
the 
main, to the promise not to strike, except for concrete economic 
reasons. The entrepreneurs pledge to do what any entrepreneur 
who has not lost his faculties and is not a swindler would do: 
Not to stop production without necessity and to fulfill his 
obligations to suppliers and buyers. 
  The role of the remaining participants of the agreement, 
evidently, comes most of all to the moral support of the main 
acting parties. 
<H5>  The Results of Trades </H5>
  From a substantive, not a structural, point of view, the 
agreement underwent the most important changes in the past few 
weeks in the part devoted to the federative structure, which was 
previously called "Regional Politics." A whole series of 
fundamentally important provisions were deleted from it. 
  Thus, it was originally proposed that "the subjects of the 
Federation agree to the repudiation of the change of their 
constitutional statuses within 2 years." Now there is no such 
provision. Likewise missing from the agreement is the promise 
that "the constitutions, statutes and other legislative acts of 
the subjects of the Federation will be brought into conformity 
and newly elaborated in strict conformity with the federal 
Constitution." As far as is known, the main opponent of this 
restriction was the Tatar president, Mintimer Shaymiyev, who not 
so long ago defended the right of Tatarstan to its own 
constitution, which does not entirely link up with the federal 
one. 
  The bilateral agreement with the federal authorities 
concluded by Shaymiyev, evidently, also induced the remaining 
subjects of the federation, the republics first of all, to 
insist on the withdrawal, from the text of the agreement, of the 
moratorium on the signing bilateral agreements about the 
delimitation of the subjects of jurisdiction and powers between 
the federal and regional organs of power. 
  All this is the evident price that had to be paid for the 
regions' support of the agreement on accord. Has the price been 
raised too high and to what extent--still remains to be seen. 
For the time being there are rumors to the effect that even the 
president of Chechnya, Dudayev, is examining the possibility of 
joining the agreement--rumors that appear not completely 
improbable and sooner speak in favor of the concessions that 
have been made. Nevertheless, the resistance of the regions even 
to potential restrictions of their rights should serve as a 
serious warning to the federal government: The support on the 
part of the regions will not come automatically. 
  Another significant difference of the original and the final 
variants of the agreement concerns questions of security. The 
original variant put emphasis on reform of the army and navy 
and, in the final analysis, on the transfer of the armed forces 
to a professional basis. In the final text there already is no 
mention of anything like that. The question of the army as a 
separate subject in general is virtually absent in the 
agreement. Only the necessity is proclaimed of "strengthening 
and increasing the effectiveness of the activity of the power 
structures," but, judging by the context, here they sooner have 
in mind the so-called "law enforcement organs." 
  This is supported also by another place of the agreement. 
Still on the eve of the signing, the draft retained the 
obligation of the Federal Assembly "during the current year [as 
per text] to create the necessary legislative basis . . . for 
the execution of reforms of the law enforcement organs." At the 
very last moment, the word "reforms" was replaced by the word 
"strengthening." It is not clear to what degree "the organs" are 
responsible for this important change, but the impression has 
been created that it was to a considerable degree. 
  Thus, in the lack of desire to reform themselves the "power 
structures" manifest touching unity. 
  Some innovations in the agreement clearly represent 
"address" 
concessions, such as, for example, the promise of the government 
"to create acceptable economic conditions for the operation of 
the agroindustrial complex." This promise is among those that 
were put into the text literally at the last moment--at the 
obvious demand of the "landowners" [agrarii]. One must suppose, 
the hopes that the "landowners" as a result of such a concession 
will nevertheless sign the agreement were retained to the very 
last moment, for the promise in the agreement was retained, in 
spite of the splendid absence of the "landowners" among the 
signatories. 
  With satisfaction it needs to be noted that they judiciously 
removed from the final variant the demand, addressed to "every 
member of society", to "tirelessly confirm" religious values, as 
well as "to propagate the primordial spiritual and moral 
traditions of Russia." Thereby the next draft "on the 
introduction of like-mindedness in Russia," fortunately, was not 
carried out. 
  Also omitted was the obligation of the parties "not to 
utilize the assessment of the events of August 1991 and 
September-October 1993 as grounds for intensifying confrontation 
and resistance." Evidently, however, it was clear that any such 
assessments of these events call forth a confrontational 
reaction with one side or another--the memory of them, which has 
by no means receded into the past, is too fresh. So that to be 
silent about these events in this situation was the only way out. 
  It would have been a good thing also to remove from the text 
the strange passage about "simplified and insulting assessments 
of the past"--for the same reason. Our recent past is too dismal 
to take it under such high protection. I would like to find out 
from the authors of the text: What assessment of that past 
precisely would they consider "insulting?" Self-pardon is not 
the best method for overcoming the past. 
<H5>  Reality or Illusion? </H5>
  In completing the signing ceremony, Yeltsin said that 
henceforth the "Civic Accord Agreement" has become "a reality of 
Russian life." I am afraid that the desirable is here given out 
to be the real. 
  I think that Grigoriyy Yavlinskiy was not right when he 
called the agreement harmful: The leader of "Yabloko" suggests 
that the present forcing of events will prevent the president in 
the future, when this will really become possible and necessary, 
to conclude such an agreement again--there are steps which 
cannot be taken twice. 
  There is, of course, no harm from the agreement. Moreover, 
it 
can entirely exert a certain beneficial influence in the 
direction of mollification of the political nerves. The central 
idea of the agreement--the necessity of civic peace--is 
indisputable, the majority of words in it are correct. The 
repetition once more of good wishes cannot bring any harm. It 
appears that the very process of the development of the text of 
the agreement has led to some rapprochement of the positions of 
its participants--thus, for example, the balanced conduct of 
Ivan Rybkin, who overcame heavy pressure from his party 
comrades, calls forth unquestionable respect. 
  What is worse is something else. Most likely, already in the 
near future the passions in regard to the agreement will be 
forgotten, as the agreement itself will happily be forgotten. 
This is already now clearly indicated by the reaction of society 
to the triumphant event: According to the results of a public 
opinion survey, immediately after the signing of more than 52 
percent of those surveyed regarded it with indifference or did 
not have an opinion of their own. 
  Such a reaction is understandable. The "Civic Accord 
Agreement" can become "a reality of life" only when it fixes 
trends that have really ripened in society. They indicate that 
society has grown tired of confrontation. But tiredness is not 
yet accord. All agree that "to live in this way is impossible," 
but unity about how for all that people should live, 
unfortunately, has not yet come into being. 
  Thank God that the strange idea of Shakhray--to adopt the 
Agreement on Accord" as a federal law--was not accepted. If this 
had been done--the agreement could not escape becoming the 
double of the sadly famous resolutions of the CPSU Central 
Committee, the USSR Supreme Soviet, and the USSR Council of 
Ministers" with their endless "to pay special attention", "to 
intensify," and "to concentrate." As if accord can be planted by 
order from above, like a potato! Or like corn. 
  The agreement will be useful if it does not give rise to 
unjustified hopes and, following them, bitter disappointments. 
Disappointed politicians are inclined to make indadequate 
decisions that strike society with pain. 
<H5>  Sometimes a Protocol on Differences Is More Useful </H5>
  In the light of what has been said above, a list of names of 
the signatories or of those who refused to sign, is certainly 
not so important. The real conduct of these or those will hardly 
be determined by the presence or absence of their signature 
under the agreement. And nevertheless the position of the 
parties [to the agreement] represents a certain interest. 
  Without a doubt, a significant factor is the refusal of the 
communists to join the agreement. Personally Zyuganov, who has 
already tasted the sweetness of the corridors of power and who 
has internally prepared himself to find a niche for himself in 
the system, possibly, would also have signed the agreement. He 
already repeatedly gave signals that he is prepared to transform 
himself into a social democrat of the parliamentary type for the 
sake of admittance into the Areopagus of the decision-makers. 
But the party, which has brought him into the Duma, decided 
differently, and to resist it Zyuganov, in contrast to Rybkin, 
did not have enough spirit. However, Zyuganov could not act 
otherwise--he understands that outside his party he represents a 
political zero. 
  The decision of the Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation 
has clearly determined its place in the Russian political 
spectrum--next to the National Salvation Front and Anpilov's 
Working Russia members. The Communists refuse to accept in the 
agreement the fact which is basic in it--the recognition of the 
reality of the change of the social system in Russia. They 
cannot reconcile themselves to this. Thereby they have 
determined their political future: Either to continually secure 
their influence through confrontation, or to disappear from the 
political scence. For Russian politicians to forget about this 
would be foolish. 
  In fact, a sort of "protocol of differences" precisely 
setting forth the positions of the parties [to the agreement] 
was signed. Such a "protocol" is also useful, as the 
understanding of political reality is always useful. By 
contrast, games of the appearance of accord in the absence of a 
real will to it are extremely dangerous. 
  Accord cannot be unlimited. Otherwise it is transformed into 
unprincipledness. 
  Several days prior to the signing of the "Accord Agreement, 
on 23 April, an, in my view, extraordinary event occurred in 
Russian political life, which nevertheless passed completely 
unnoticed. On this day, the newspaper IZVESTIYA published a 
verbose article by Zhirinovskiy, with an exposition of his 
political program. I shall recall that by decision of the last 
congress of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], the 
leader of the party was given extraordinary powers, and, 
henceforth, the statements of Zhirinovskiy are not the opinion 
of a private individual, but the official position of the party, 
which has now adopted the name LDPR-PZH [Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia--Party of Zhirinovskiy]. And so, among the many 
pearls of this programmatic party article, which I am not 
inclined to examine here, is the following: "It is necessary to 
`close' down the autonomous republics, oblasts, etc., and 
immediately reestablish the guberniya headed by a governor. And 
in so doing not hold any discussions. Quickly, rigidly, by means 
of a corresponding edict, dispatch the sovereign presidents who 
do not want to become transformed into governors to suburban 
Moscow dachas for a `discussion.' Let them rest, eat smetana 
[sour cream], watch television, only don't let them leave the 
territory of the dacha in the interest of their security. After 
a couple of years they will leave--it will already be a 
different country. And without a drop of blood." 
  Well, as far as blood is concerned--that we have already 
heard: Vladimir Volfovich intends to make his way even to the 
Indian Ocean on tanks without a single drop of blood, proceeding 
from the "realistic" assumption that no one will start to resist 
him. But here in essence the procedure of "dispatching to 
dachas" described by Zhirinovskiy is called the internment of 
leading statesmen, and the passage as a whole is a call to a 
coup d'etat. 
  The act of Zhirinovskiy, committed by him on 23 April, 
clearly qualifies according to Article 70 of the Criminal Code 
of Russia: "Calls for the forceful change of the constitutional 
order." According to Article 1 of the Constitution of the 
Russian Federation, Russia is a democratic federative 
law-governed state with a republican form of rule: Through the 
"closing down" of the republics, the constitutional federative 
basis of the state is fully destroyed. Internment--quickly, 
rigidly, and without discussions are an unequivocal act of force. 
  Thus, the leader of the second largest parliamentary party 
group in the Duma, endowed by his party with the powers to 
formulate its policy personally, in the heat of the discussion 
of the final variant of the "Civic Accord Agreement," declares 
his intention to carry out a coup d'etat in the near future. And 
the only reaction of society in so doing is the limp answer in 
that same IZVESTIYA of Otto Latsis, ridiculing Zhirinovskiy, 
like Khlestakov! 
  The procuracy is silent, which in its time under pressure of 
the public had instituted proceedings against Zhirinovskiy in 
the matter of the propagation of war, but now is clearly trying 
to have this case disappear in the sand. 
  Also silent are the other parties and election blocs, the 
"colleagues" of the LDPR-PZH in the Duma are not conducting 
indignant parliamentary inquiries and are not declaring 
protests. Mr Gaydar, the defender of democracy, Mr Shakhray, the 
defender of federalism, how are we supposed to interpret your 
silence? Or do you also share the view that all this is only 
inoffensive shameless bragging to which one cannot but call 
attention? But then, what reasons do you have to expect that 
people will take seriously the parliament, where you sit next to 
Zhirinovskiy? 
  Silent are the "sovereign presidents", the very same who 
intend to intervene, and, not even having wiped off the spittle 
from their face, place their signature under the "Accord 
Agreement" next to the signature of Zhirinovskiy? This is 
difficult to fit into consciousness. 
  And after this you want society to place hopes on such an 
agreement? In such a situation the accord looks like connivance. 
  Zhirinovskiy does not conceal his ultimate political 
ambitions. In his dreams he already sees the longed-for moment 
prophetically described by A. K. Tolstoy in the unforgettable 
"Istoriya gosudarstva Rossiyskogo" [History of the Russian 
State]: 
  "And, having climbed up to the place of Boris, this impudent 
fellow, out of joy with the bride, he began to dangle his feet." 
  If this, God forbid, will happen, then not civil peace, but 
full-scale civil war will become the reality of Russian life. In 
the grown-up Russian society, forces are announcing themselves 
that no longer under any circumstances will resign themselves 
either to the railway cars for dissidents "to Taymir, the last 
stop--tundra", or to the "bloodless" dashes to the south. 
Closing the eyes today to the appeal on the part of political 
adventurists, we are sowing the seeds of tomorrow's civil war. 
  The country really needs civic accord. And not for two 
years. 
To secure it, not demonstrative, but realistic and principled 
actions are necessary. It is impossible to allow for political 
deluge to begin "after us." 
  P.S. A number of days ago, appearing on radio with 
commentaries concerning the signing of the agreement, I 
expressed the opinion about the dangerous game set forth above, 
which the leader of the LDPR-PZH is playing. Soon after this, I 
received a call from someone who called himself "colonel of the 
tank forces" from the "army in the field" and promised that in 
the near future I will be "crushed" (by a tank, one must 
suppose?). 
  We are not talking about me--I am an elderly person who has 
long since ceased to be afraid. But then what about civic 
accord? Not invite to the signing of the "Accord Agreement" also 
the "forces" who killed Ayzderdzis? It goes without saying, 
having amnestied them beforehand.

<F P=106> [Dialogue between former KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov and </F>
ZAVTRA Editor in Chief Aleksandr Prokhanov; place and date not 
given: "Vladimir Kryuchkov: `National Security Is at Zero 
Point'"] 
  [Text] [Prokhanov] Vladimir Aleksandrovich, in my 
perception you are one of the last Soviet statesmen for whom the 
collapse of the Soviet Union was a personal tragedy. At the 
stages immediately preceding the destruction of the great power, 
you began to actively and openly voice your position. In August 
1991 you undertook a last desperate attempt to avert this 
disintegration--an unsuccessful attempt, for which you paid with 
a year and a half of incarceration, suffering, humiliation, and 
political ostracism. 
  You must sense the existence of a certain design aimed at 
the 
destruction of the Soviet Union. There are conspiracy models, a 
plot theory circulating in our patriotic circles. In part, it 
appeals to me, although I understand very well that it is 
difficult, for instance, to draw up a blueprint of a superplot 
sometime at the beginning of our century and then consistently, 
methodically implement it. Of course, there was a general trend 
of efforts aimed at the destruction of the Soviet Union, and 
within it there existed numerous doctrines, micro-projects, and 
merely operations of our opponents. Some were successful; others 
collapsed after encountering our ability to defend ourselves. 
  Speaking in the language of mythology rather than 
intelligence or political science: There existed a certain 
design for destroying the USSR. It included such tasks as, for 
instance, squeezing the Soviet Union out of global zones of 
confrontation: Africa, Asia. It contained a score of programs 
aimed at weakening our geopolitical belts in Central and East 
Europe. It definitely included the weakening of our military 
potential, removing parity status through unilateral 
disarmament, and absolute military collapse. It also had built 
into it the destruction of state structures, in particular the 
military. 
  Very little is known about the Soviet Union's withdrawal 
from 
East Europe, how the communist pro-Soviet regimes collapsed in 
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, and about the unification 
of Germany. Its unification was accompanied by propaganda 
slogans based on so-called "universal human values." In my 
opinion, however, unification in Germany more than anything else 
potentially holds a tremendous danger for the Europe of the 21st 
century, including Russia. Did Gorbachev and the State Security 
Committee take into account the potential consequences of this 
unification; and generally, how did the Soviet Union leave East 
Europe? 
  [Kryuchkov] Looking at the conspiracy model you described, 
in 
reality everything was simpler and at the same time more 
complex. More complex in the sense that we did not sort out 
right away the deep-seated internal and external factors that 
led our country to tragedy. And simpler because plans to destroy 
our Union have indeed been developed and implemented, because 
the West saw a danger to itself in the existence of such a 
powerful state. 
  Strictly speaking, the West did not conceal these plans. 
Moreover, there are our own, domestic figures who only recently 
were bragging that they had something to do with it, and that 
they contributed to what has happened. Seeing the latest events 
in the country, they became less vocal, though, because now the 
moment of reckoning is coming. I think the time will still come 
when these people will be held to answer. 
  I remember my conversation with former CIA Director Gates, 
which took place in Moscow in 1990. He said then: "Mr. 
Kryuchkov, would you like me to give you a very interesting 
report, from which you will learn what will be happening in your 
country in the year 2000, at the point of transition to another 
century?" I said: "Of course." He promised to send me the 
materials, and I promised in return to put on paper my 
perception of global problems. He never sent the materials, but, 
as I learned later, among other things the report said that in a 
year or two the Soviet Union would no longer exist. 
  When the head of state security gets this kind of 
information 
firsthand, it tells you a lot. Our intelligence officers also 
reported that it was commonly expected in the West that the plan 
to break up the Soviet state would succeed in the near future. 
And our own analytical evaluations as well led us to sad 
conclusions. As KGB chairman (and before that, chief of foreign 
intelligence for almost 15 years), I openly told Gorbachev in 
1989, 1990, and 1991 of the impending danger. 
  The trouble was that this man never told the truth. He 
hedged, dodged, and agreed: "Yes, yes." But no measures were 
taken, and everything was sliding into an abyss. Moreover, some 
of his actions did not fit with the notion of actions expected 
of a statesman, whose responsibility it was to take care of 
society and to try to forestall tragedy. The country was going 
through a succession of failures, but instead of holding the 
defense, and occasionally going on the offensive, all we did was 
retreat, retreat... 
  The events that took place in the heart of Europe at the end 
of 1989 are something we will long remember. Even in the West 
the reaction to them was not at all uniform. In December 1989, 
President of France Mitterrand came to the GDR on an official 
three-day visit. And this at a time when the GDR already was 
falling apart; groups of youth from West Germany were attacking 
the building of the Ministry of State Security, and rallies had 
been held in some cities for the unification of West and East 
Germany. 
  Of course, Mitterrand was well informed of the current 
events, but he wanted to demonstrate his goodwill stance toward 
the German Democratic Republic. The point is that neither France 
nor England were ready to see the GDR absorbed by West Germany. 
They thought it would be a slow process, within the framework of 
general European integration, in a form that would not affect 
its future in any way. Because both France and England know what 
a powerful unified Germany means... 
  I cannot say that the processes were totally unexpected for 
us. The unexpected part was only that they rolled in so swiftly 
and that the leadership of the Soviet Union completely resigned 
themselves to it. I do not want to say that I was not related to 
it at all. I raised these questions. If you dig into documents 
you will find very alarming KGB memoranda addressed to 
Gorbachev, in which we warned of what could happen. 
  As to Gorbachev, they valued him tremendously in Germany; he 
was later declared a "No. 1 German" in West Germany. By the way, 
Helmut Kohl said these notable words at the time: Germans should 
not miss the chance of unification, and that chance is a result 
of the fact that Gorbachev is at the helm of the Soviet Union. 
  You know, this was not just surrendering positions--it was a 
real capitulation that happens only in the most serious defeat. 
We fled not only from the GDR but also from other countries, 
without a thought about our short-term interests. We welcomed 
German unification--in reality, the absorption of the 
GDR--without attaching any conditions to it. We abandoned our 
property; we abandoned our friends, who had been with us for 40 
years, on whom we drew for support and who helped us; because it 
is hard to tell who gave more over the last few years: we to the 
GDR or the GDR to us. 
  Then came the arrests of intelligence officers and 
statesmen. 
Erich Milke, minister of security and Hero of the Soviet Union, 
is in jail now--a man who put his entire life on the altar of 
internationalism, the altar of Soviet-German friendship. Some 
other friends from the Ministry of State Security are in jail on 
charges of horrendous crimes; and in general, many GDR statesmen 
are in prison for allegedly committing crimes against Germany. 
While all they did was carry out their duties as citizens of the 
completely independent state of the GDR--recognized in the world 
and, among others, at the United Nations... I think this is not 
the end of it all; there will be more. Because Germany already 
has revised the outcome of a world war once, and it cost us 
alone 27 million human lives... 
  The story of the GDR is an ignominious page in our history, 
a 
shameful page, possibly with far-reaching consequences. If we 
continue to remain so unwise, this may do tremendous damage to 
our vital interests. You know how we lost many friends in 
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and many other places... 
  I am not saying that Germany will definitely go in a 
direction fatefully detrimental for us. This depends on many 
factors. But if we continue to remain in our current state, 
whether we want it or not this will whet the appetite of other 
countries. And we should not expect altruism in this respect. 
  [Prokhanov] It so happened that I went to Germany the day an 
aircraft carrying the ill Honecker was leaving for the Soviet 
Union from the same airport. He was coming to our country for 
treatment, but in reality he was flying there to a future of 
captivity, disgrace, humiliation, and arrest, perhaps knowing 
deep in his heart that this is exactly what awaited him. 
Gorbachev betrayed his trust--as he did with other allies, 
effectively surrendering them to enemies and tormentors. 
  This is what I am thinking about, though. In 1945, when the 
Russian Army entered Berlin and Europe was still smoldering in 
the ashes of war, Stalin, together with the other leaders of 
victorious countries, carved up Europe, established borders, and 
accomplished a change of a social system in the countries of 
East Europe. What immense, if perhaps tragic for the population, 
measures were implemented across the entire enormous expanse 
from the Baltics to the Black Sea! A geopolitical design was 
implemented which, as rumor goes, had existed even before the 
war in the mind of Tarle, who read Stalin his treatises, his 
essays on a pan-Slavic union in Europe by the end of the 20th 
century... 
  What I am saying is that after the war a superorganizational 
design was implemented, the result of which was the emergence of 
a pro-Soviet Europe. So why have all these efforts--military, 
economic, geopolitical--been nullified overnight? After all, 
there was already an entire generation of Czechs, Poles, and 
Germans with values and a psychology that the West Germans, for 
instance, still cannot grind out... 
  One would think that such failure can be sustained only as a 
result of a strike, a crushing military defeat--of the kind that 
happened, for instance, to the Germans in 1945. We were fleeing 
from there as if we were under the fire of nuclear cannons and a 
strategic bombers' strike! As it turned out, however, it all 
happened after one or two trips by Gorbachev--one to Reykjavik, 
another to Malta. Somebody said a few words to somebody; 
somebody promised something to somebody; somebody shook 
somebody's hand in the quiet of an office; guarantees were 
given; perhaps an immense amount of money was paid, some immense 
promises made to Gorbachev... 
  Why did one word of Gorbachev's all of a sudden prove 
stronger than the entire huge mega-machinery of the Soviet 
presence in Europe? What was it that they whispered to him, 
promised him? For me, as a writer, this is a mystery and a 
subject for a plot. What do you think? 
  [Kryuchkov] There is one factor I would like to start with 
in 
answering. As you know, in 1990-1991 the system of governing our 
country, the decisionmaking mechanism, was changed. When we had 
Article 6 of the old Constitution, which formalized the leading 
role of the party, the most important issues, including those of 
foreign policy, were decided exclusively in the CPSU Central 
Committee Politburo. When we rejected the leading role of the 
party, we needed to replace the Politburo with another organ 
rather than leaving complete control over everything to one 
person--the president, no matter how much of a genius he might 
be. And Gorbachev was not such a person anyway. This gave 
Gorbachev, Shevardnadze, Yakovlev, and other persons the 
opportunity to make decisions without the support of legal norms 
and collective will. 
  At the end of the war, when we were drained of our 
lifeblood, 
had lost tens of millions of people, East Europe, changed from a 
territory hostile to us to a friendly one. And when the 
processes of forming states with a new sociopolitical system 
began, there was no opposition. In the years following the war 
we quickly restored the ruined economy. This was a brilliant 
victory, perhaps as great in significance as the victory in the 
Great Patriotic War. In 1948-1949 we already reached the prewar 
level, and in 1950-1951 we began to bring on line plants, entire 
industrial complexes, electric power stations. The nation 
returned to life. We again became a great power the world had to 
reckon with. This said that the socialist system had not 
exhausted its possibilities but had just begun to approach them. 
We took the road that promised peace in Europe, and people 
understood this very well. 
  I think that by all these deeds and accomplishments we built 
at the time a very serious margin of security for many decades 
and made good use of this margin. Our state had a huge safety 
margin. Our gold bullion alone amounted to 2,500 tonnes in 1953. 
Ask how much gold we have now. You will get an answer that is 
simply demeaning for us. 
  We should look for answers to far-reaching questions in two 
directions. First, in our system, in our governing mechanism, 
the national leadership--that is, objective things. Second, we 
should give subjective factors their due. First and foremost the 
procedures for electing our presidents, evaluation of the 
possibility or impossibility of placing authority in their 
hands. This is a very important issue, and many countries have 
long insured themselves against all sorts of flukes. We, 
unfortunately, left a multitude of loopholes for these 
accidental things, and will pay for this more than once. 
  [Prokhanov] Being a writer and a free artist, by a certain 
logic I found myself plunged into a journalistic battle when an 
all-out campaign began against the Soviet Army. I was amazed at 
how an army that has established control over half the world, is 
capable of sending aircraft carrier groups into every ocean and 
sending global control orbital stations into space, found itself 
defenseless against those who were destroying it in front of our 
very eyes! I remember: All of a sudden a theory was advanced 
that the Soviet Army is a source of thermonuclear threat, and 
the entire population was horrified by the possibility of the 
start of World War III, while the military was seen as the devil 
incarnate. I remember how it came out that the army was being 
called an army of parasites; when all our economic troubles, the 
insufficient percentage of protein in our nutrition, were being 
blamed on it: That it had allegedly exhausted our economy and 
eaten up our development potential. The military was accused of 
cruelty, of propagating ruthless, antihumane, almost brutal 
customs... 
  I jumped into this battle, tried to explain that the 
military 
is the concentrate of statehood, the guarantor of world 
stability, and if we have no world wars it is only because the 
Soviet Army is strong. I tried to show that a Soviet officer, 
with his ethics based on sacrifice and service to the people, is 
the standard of public service to the country... A lot insults 
were heaped at me at the time. 
  One of the latest phases associated with the collapse of the 
Soviet Army were the so-called "set-ups." The army was sent into 
zones of internal interethnic conflicts, in particular, Baku, 
Tbilisi, Vilnius, while at the same time a certain dual policy 
was conducted. 
  One originated at the center, in particular, from Aleksandr 
Yakovlev, and encouraged in every way nationalist movements in 
the republics; people's fronts were springing up; our party 
leadership secretly met with their leaders and coddled them in 
every way. These people's fronts were a force that strived to 
seize power from the republic parties, from the republic 
leadership, and very serious conflicts were arising on these 
grounds. 
  Another one was when the same center sent troops into the 
zone of conflict to suppress this unrest. First a wound was 
inflamed; then the steel probe of the army was sent, the wound 
was stirred up even more, and the result was a nationalist 
explosion. Use of force is very traumatic for the population; it 
incites them. An entire nation would rise up against the central 
military leadership. Then the military was called back and, 
having first established order, it withdrew in humiliation. 
  The reputation of the military both in the republics and the 
Union was dropping to zero; commissions were set up, like 
Sobchak's, or the one with the participation of the writer 
Vasilyev. The military was traumatized, it was demoralized, and 
the winners were regionalism and separatism. 
  Could you, as a person associated with intelligence, 
security, get a feel of all these mechanisms at the time? What 
was your perception of all these conflicts: Tbilisi, Baku, 
Vilnius? Who was the "architect" of this tragedy? 
  [Kryuchkov] I remember very well how you fought for our 
military. I greatly appreciated your efforts then, and remember 
them now with gratitude. 
  In 1990 Academician Arbatov began to say that our military 
budget considerably exceeded that of the United States. This was 
an outright lie. The U.S. budget at the time exceeded $300 
billion, while ours was 70 billion rubles [R], but even then the 
dollar and the ruble were not comparable in weight. The attacks 
on the military pursued a single purpose: to knock out one of 
the most important pillars of the state. Of course, not 
everything was ideal in our military--there were a lot of 
shortcomings... 
  At the same time, the military-industrial complex already in 
1990 produced up to 100 percent of the output of certain 
categories of civilian products, in particular, television sets 
and washing machines; that is, even then it was not a burden to 
the state. In 1990 the Soviet Union accounted for more than 
one-third of global arms sales. Currently the United States' 
share is 38 percent, while quite recently it was only 18 
percent. See who we have surrendered to?! 
  Attacks on our military were being conducted in all 
directions, and I think that those who set as their goal to 
destroy it have achieved this to a considerable extent. In the 
level of combat readiness our current armed forces are hardly 
capable of deflecting any aggression. This is very serious. 
  This "setting up" of the military began under Khrushchev. 
Remember the Novocherkassk events? Later, whenever a difficult 
situation arose, military units were moved to forward positions. 
  In 1988-1989 events were brewing in the Caucasus, and again 
military units were activated there. Then came Karabakh, 
Lithuania, Baku, and so on. 
  In Tbilisi, for instance, the army was cleverly set up in 
the 
interests of certain circles. Georgian forces were fighting for 
power. In order to avoid doing this themselves, they drew the 
armed forces into the conflict. I am fully convinced that this 
was not done without the knowledge of the highest leadership of 
the party and the state. 
  In January 1991 the situation in Lithuania heated up so 
much, 
taking such an unpredictable turn, that it came to direct 
clashes on a massive scale. The forces that came to power took a 
position against the constitution of the USSR of the time and of 
the republic itself, and took a course on secession from the 
Union in a way not envisaged by the law. And the forces that 
wanted to prevent the violation of the constitution, that 
supported the Union, were subjected to direct persecution and 
repression. They had a moral right to defend themselves. Then 
the military units stationed in Lithuania decided to ensure 
minimal order, to forestall potential bloodshed. They were 
carrying out only protective functions. 
  I remember very well the materials of the investigation. It 
followed from them that the casualties were killed and wounded 
not by the military but by other persons who were in the crowd, 
who were provoking the unrest, which was used by the reactionary 
forces in the republic as a pretext to start more active actions 
and as a result achieve their goals. 
  The subsequent development of events in Lithuania fully 
confirmed this. I think that A. Yakovlev's trips to these 
republics at the time also played their role. Every time they 
were followed by an explosion of actions against the center, 
against the constitutional order. It is apparent that his hand 
showed in this, too. 
  I once wrote in one of my articles about the actions of 
certain individuals who were beginning to destroy our 
Fatherland, and I will not take back a single word. I think that 
in terms of destructive force, in terms of exerting a corrupting 
influence on many aspects of our life, the main credit should go 
to A. Yakovlev. I cannot tell what drove him in the beginning: 
strictly personal traits, vanity, or something else, but in any 
case many of his actions were not in any sense in the interests 
of our state. 
  [Prokhanov] I think that the history of the disintegration 
of 
the Soviet Union and the current post-Soviet history are replete 
with mystery. History in general is a hierarchy of mysteries, 
most of which never come to the surface. Among the mysteries of 
the last decade is mentioned, for instance, the disappearance of 
the so-called party--essentially, state--gold. It is believed 
that there is still information on the highest leadership of the 
Soviet Union kept in secret safes that tells of their 
recruitment and their connections with secret, closed Western 
organizations. 
  One such version, circulating to a very limited extent in 
intellectual circles and very cautiously mentioned at seminars 
and symposiums, concerns a certain German project nurtured in 
the Soviet leadership, involving an infusion of a large quantity 
of capital into West Germany and concealing this capital from 
the public. This capital allegedly was accumulated by German 
business and controlled by people from the Soviet Union for the 
contingency of post-Soviet history, when it is to be returned 
here, to our space, to nurture a new authority, a new generation 
of statesmen on the basis of a Russian-German alliance. 
  Allegedly, already then a certain convergence of economies, 
of future financial systems, and future policy had begun. And 
one can see a trend toward rapprochement with Germany in today's 
convulsive political process. Among patriots, for instance, some 
are anti-German, while the others are pro-German. For instance, 
Zhirinovskiy openly proclaims a Russian-German alliance. Behind 
all these statements--speeches, hints, innuendoes--one can 
detect the formula of that early Soviet-German project. 
  Do you know anything about this, have you heard about it? 
  [Kryuchkov] I think your question is based to a certain 
extent on reality, but this is also a fruit of mythology. The 
actions of U.S. politicians are driven by one set of interests; 
our politicians are guided by other interests--if they are 
pro-Soviet, of course; the French have their own, the Chinese 
and Japanese--their own... These interests engender both certain 
alliances of forces, and their lobbying. Under Stalin, any 
lobbying was out of question. Sometime in the 1960's, however, 
under Khrushchev, we gradually began to practice a rather broad 
system of lobbying. 
  It is time to tentatively identify our lobbying groups, 
without bringing up actual names at this point. I think that we 
have a pro-German lobby, a pro-American, pro-Chinese, 
pro-Japanese, and pro-European one; then there are branches of 
the above that do not play a significant role. 
  [Prokhanov] The only lobby we do not have is a pro-Russian 
one. 
  [Kryuchkov] Speaking of what you have in mind, I think that 
such a pro-Russian lobby is undergoing a revival today; it is 
getting stronger and broader. I believe that in a very near 
future it will proclaim itself loudly. 
  Our lobbying does not operate by the same rules as in the 
West. The pro-Japanese lobby in the United States, for instance, 
spends enormous sums of money, makes major investments in 
economic sectors that are interesting and profitable for Japan. 
Our lobbies operate gratis. I am deeply convinced that the 
Germans, Americans, and others do not invest billions in 
lobbying in order to realize their ideas. On the contrary, they 
are pumping money out of our country. Because the aid that goes 
to Russia and some CIS countries--if one can call these crumbs 
aid--is generated through the theft taking place in our country. 
Tens of billions flow abroad, and at best only a few million 
come back. 
  I have heard of this Soviet-German myth, and I am convinced 
that all this is not true. The Germans may, of course, spend 
some money to support the German communities in our state, to 
develop some or other sectors in our industry, to set up some 
training. But there is not and will not be powerful support for 
our pro-German lobby or billions in investment. 
  Where have our reserves and wealth disappeared? A very 
simple 
thing is happening in this respect: At some stage we engaged in 
self-consumption. We permitted industrial production to decline, 
permitted inflation. Since the 1990's corruption has been 
spreading rapidly. In the past we had a foreign trade monopoly; 
today this would be our salvation. So why is our oil today sold 
by private individuals? Should not the state be doing this? What 
is happening is real squandering, real theft... 
  As to the party money, I will tell you: Had there been, let 
us say, massive embezzlement of party money, a massive outflow 
of the party gold to a foreign country, I can assure you that 
the KGB certainly would have heard something about it. 
  [Prokhanov] In your communications you constantly 
contemplate 
the problems of security, formulating its concept in classic 
form, creating a hierarchy of different levels of security, 
including cultural and intellectual. Its foundation, however, is 
still geopolitical security, the balance of world powers. Russia 
cannot be considered today a certain subject in a geopolitically 
finished form--this is meaningless. Today's Russia cannot 
formulate its security without measuring itself against, 
identifying itself with, neighboring Ukraine. It cannot 
formulate its security without the sense of its presence in 
Kazakhstan all the way to the Chinese border, without a 
perception of its historical and geopolitical unity with 
Belarus, which pushes the border of Russia's defense to the 
Polish border. 
  What is your opinion of Russia's strategic interests? 
  [Kryuchkov] To my great regret, I have come to the 
conviction 
that today's Russia is essentially not vital as a state. We have 
never been in such a grave situation with respect to security. 
We are currently vulnerable literally from all sides. 
  Take our borders. Finland, the Baltics, Poland, Hungary, 
Romania, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, China, Japan, the United 
States... It so happens that our borders have become 
disputable--at ,least we hear such voices from the other side of 
our borders. Before 1985 nobody raised such issues. The Soviet 
Union was a mighty superpower. Now all of a sudden everybody has 
simultaneously started voicing claims on our territories; even 
the Baltic countries have raised this issue. It has reached the 
point of direct provocations at borders. 
  When there was a great Soviet Union, we could security 
defend 
one-sixth of the world's territory. First, our population 
comprised almost 300 million; second, we had strong industry and 
science. Our positions in East Europe, Asia, Africa, and some 
Latin American countries permitted us to be certain of our 
security. Nobody touched us. I think we could be "busy" with 
peaceful labor for another 50 years. Generally speaking, nothing 
and nobody threatened us. Now the situation has changed. 
  Look to the east. Japan lays claim to Kuril Minor range. 
This 
is a serious claim, and the Japanese stand firm on it. They do 
not say that they will resolve this issue by force. But under 
certain circumstances the situation may become very unfavorable 
for us, and we will be helpless to do anything. 
  We have reasonably good relations with China now. But China 
has never said that it does not have any territorial claims 
against us. Moreover, not the entire border is marked. 
Therefore, while giving due credit to the sensible policy of the 
current leadership of China, can we be sure that its next 
generation will hold the same course? 
  Take the West. I think that the Germans would be well served 
if they do not forget the lessons of history and remember 
Bismarck, who understood the significance of Russia for Germany 
and nothing cast a shadow on our relations. But there also were 
two world wars. History has a peculiar trait--it repeats itself. 
If certain forces in Germany return to a militarist policy, is 
there someone to keep them from taking ill-considered steps? 
Moreover, there may be some who are interested in channeling 
Germany in a certain direction. I cannot understand the United 
States and the British, who are aware of this danger but so far 
remain silent. 
  Our south also is very dangerous. We had strong positions in 
Afghanistan, but the situation has changed. There are countries 
with which we absolutely have to be friends. I mean India--our 
natural geopolitical ally, which has a stake in good relations 
with us. There is a large group of countries in Asia which we 
can regard with great optimism. These are so-called minor 
countries that already play an important role--South Korea, 
Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines... 
  We had strong positions in Africa, and some used to say: 
What 
are we doing; why are we there? But let us think about it once 
again. Our expenditures there were minimal, while we did derive 
a certain profit. In addition, this was where the struggle was 
conducted for political positions at our remote outposts. Now we 
are approachable--almost to the heart of Russia... 
  We also had good relations developing with a number of Latin 
American countries. We had active military cooperation with 
Peru, and due to this factor alone we were receiving up to $1 
billion of net profit. And generally, Latin America is a very 
promising continent from the standpoint of our geopolitical 
situation. 
  Unless there is sharp progress in the very near future in 
relations with CIS countries, unless we take the road of close 
integration, the situation will become very difficult for all of 
us. Still, I am an optimist and I believe that this process will 
begin, and Russia, together with parts of the former Soviet 
Union, will create a society, a state entity, that will ensure 
our collective security. 
  There is currently a certain imbalance in the world: Some 
countries are coming to the forefront, some are receding, but 
sooner or later everything will stabilize. We would be 
ill-advised to believe that all of this will happen on its own. 
Nothing of the sort! Without human will, without the will of the 
leadership of certain countries, this is not going to happen. 
  [Prokhanov] And what about such a problem for Russia--and 
many other countries as well--as the Jewish problem? The Jewish 
factor played an enormous role in foreign and domestic policy in 
the former Soviet Union and in today's Russia. At certain times 
it went under the surface, took on a coded form, and then at 
some point it would suddenly become a priority, and entire 
political groups mulled over it. Sometimes the Jewish problem 
held the threat of a global catastrophe--as it did during the 
Arab-Israeli wars in the Near East. 
  Today the Jewish problem is delineated by an internal drama, 
the Russian-Jewish conflict at ideological, cultural, and ethnic 
level, as well as the drama of the Russian choice in the Near 
East. Traditional groups of Arab countries still see us as a 
potential ally who betrayed them at a crucial moment. Israel, on 
the other hand, is the strategic ally of the United States, with 
which today's Russia has established long-term relations of 
partnership. This mysterious triangle, or if you wish, polygon, 
today grips human passions and destinies. Enormous energies are 
being burned in this regard, and completely unproductively. 
  How do you see the Russian-Jewish issue, the political 
factor 
of Russia and Israel in the context of 20th century history? 
  [Kryuchkov] This question does have peculiar aspects. The 
explanation to them is in the history of the Jewish people, 
their difficult road in the struggle for survival. For thousands 
of years Jews were a relatively small nation in a far from 
friendly environment. They not only survived, but increased 
their numbers and in the end achieved the formation of an 
independent state. In a historical sense, Russia has long been a 
motherland for a considerable number of Jews. According to the 
1897 census, half the world population of Jews lived within the 
borders of tsarist Russia. 
  Over the last couple of decades not everything was smooth in 
relations between the Soviet Union and Israel. Problems arose 
with respect to Jewish emigration, and this gave rise to 
arguments, confrontation, and misunderstanding. Currently this 
problem has been removed. And I do not see any other problems 
that could somehow seriously damage Russo-Israeli relations. 
  At the same time I believe that a society cannot consider 
itself healthy if it produces, for instance, anti-Georgian, 
anti-Ukrainian, anti-Belarusian, or anti-Jewish attitudes. But 
this is a two-edged process. 
  Over the past few years we have had no direct anti-Jewish 
manifestations. I remember that when I was KGB chairman we 
received warnings of potential anti-Jewish pogroms. We checked 
them out and never found anything to them. Apparently what we 
are dealing with is not some anti-Jewish manifestations but 
simply disagreement with some or other aspects of Israeli policy 
toward, for instance, Arab countries. In my opinion, it has not 
been optimal. Lately, history has demonstrated that there are 
healthy forces in Israel; there are smart people who understand 
that it is necessary to move into a broad front of development 
of Arab-Israeli relations. And this viewpoint now prevails. 
  I do not think that Jews in the Soviet Union are in a 
position of an oppressed ethnic group. Nothing of the kind. They 
hold decent positions in all spheres of administration, 
industry, agriculture, medicine, science, etc. Moreover, I think 
that there are certain extremes in this, too, but this is 
happening for the reason of certain special traits of their 
character and partly because of the complacency of Russians. 
  I think that some persons of Jewish nationality are making a 
serious mistake. They frequently go too far in labeling some or 
other political figure an anti-Semite. This is not always so. 
For instance, speaking against certain aspects of Tel Aviv's 
policy does not mean one is an anti-Semite. Speaking against 
certain actions of persons of Jewish nationality here does not 
mean one is an anti-Semite, either. In the same way one can 
speak against Kazakhs, Ukrainians, Belarusians, but this does 
not mean that this person is anti-Kazakh, anti-Ukrainian, or 
anti-Belarusian. 
  I think that the process of creating a better atmosphere for 
the development of relations between Russia and Israel must 
proceed from both sides. Israel and Russia have serious reasons 
to speak of the compatibility of certain interests in the 
geopolitical structure of the world. And in this respect we 
absolutely cannot orient ourselves toward individual persons of 
Jewish nationality. I, for one, will never judge the position of 
all Jews by the actions and deeds of, for instance, Minkin, 
Plutnik, and some others. 
  This is far from full compatibility, of course, but it would 
not be in the interests of either country to disregard it. 
  [Prokhanov] I propose that we come down from geopolitical 
heights back to our sinful earth. 
  On one hand, it seems to me that the current regime, having 
gone through phases of crises, in a way has suddenly come to its 
senses and begun to take steps towards stabilization in Russia. 
Attempts are being made to stabilize the sociopsychological 
atmosphere by all these charters of reconciliation, through 
state regulation of the economy. There are attempts to stabilize 
the situation at the border. There is talk about military 
development, increasing military orders. We, people of the 
opposition, should appraise all this positively. Hurt and 
insulted, remembering all the wounds and traumas dealt us by the 
regime, we still should not reject outright all these actions 
aimed at stabilization. 
  On the other hand, against this background, which to a large 
extent is only being proclaimed, we see again some steps towards 
destroying the remnants of Russian statehood. This involves the 
system of security, everything that used to be called the 
ministry of security and now has become the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service. People come to me from these 
agencies, people who have left, been fired, have fled, been 
thrown out--they are horrified at what is being done to this 
last bulwark of Russia's security. 
  What is your opinion of what is happening in your former 
domain, the Committee for State Security, and what this organism 
is being turned into? What does this mean for the state and the 
country? 
  [Kryuchkov] Yeltsin's latest steps, aimed at reaching an 
accord, were manifested impulsively earlier as well, in the form 
of occasionally dropped phrases, because you cannot keep 
threatening and act only by enforcement methods. I think the 
explanation is simple: The regime has found itself in a very 
difficult situation; many see it as hopeless, and therefore they 
undertook such steps in the interests of survival. 
  But I also think that those to whom this accord is being 
offered would be wrong not to use this opportunity to ease the 
hardship of life for our people. It is another matter what the 
proposal will be. We have to look at it. 
  Problems related to state security are closer to me. I could 
anticipate and have anticipated many things, but what has 
happened in our Fatherland has exceeded my worst expectations. 
In August 1991 the first reorganization of the KGB took place; 
at the end of 1991--the second; then the third... I have lost 
count. We need to organize not just reliable security but also 
make it economical. Everything that is being done currently is 
not economical. Because these organizations have not become 
smaller numerically--they have simply been dispersed into 
different corners. There is no system now in dealing with 
security problems, and this is impermissible. There are 
apparently considerable means allocated to it, considering the 
disastrous state of the country, but the entire system of 
security--and this is the tragedy--is subordinated not to the 
interests of the state but those of a certain individual. How 
long can this go on? A year, two, three... Sooner or later it 
will all collapse anyway. Intelligence has been separated; 
counterintelligence, communications, protective units, technical 
services, border troops have been taken out of the total 
structure of security; that is, everything is fragmented. 
  Until August 1991 everything was a single mechanism; we were 
at a level necessary to deal with problems of security 
associated with the country as a whole. Now this does not exist. 
We know that thousands of skilled personnel have left the 
organs; new ones have come, poorly trained--they have different 
selection criteria there now: apparently loyalty toward the 
regime rather than professional skills. In the past the most 
important thing for us was attitude towards the Motherland, this 
was a sacred notion. In the past, we had duty--another sacred 
notion. Now everything has shifted and lost shape. The system of 
security--broken up, dismembered, drained of its lifeblood, 
stripped of cadres--is unable to deal with the tasks it is 
facing. Those who will inherit this component of our statehood, 
or rather its bits and pieces, will find themselves in a very 
difficult situation. 
  How do we solve security problems? We have to work on this 
fast, because intelligence operations against our country 
continue, the drug business is growing, international organized 
crime is active, smuggling is running wild, our secrets are 
swimming away... There are some secrets that are worth billions 
of dollars, and they are being taken from us almost for free. 
While the organs, drained and destroyed, are expected to fight 
all this. 
  [Prokhanov] The country is living through, as we say, a 
systemic crisis. This is the crisis of the socium in all its 
manifestations. Among the directions in which it is developing 
there is a power dimension. We are living through a crisis of 
authority. In normal constitutional societies this is resolved 
by changing the cabinet, leadership, course. The losing team 
gives way to another one through constitutional forms. 
  In our country this is apparently precluded. All crises 
since 
1991 have been resolved by methods of force. I have a feeling 
that this power crisis, as it grows rather than diminishes, must 
produce a cascade of similar power catastrophes. It is not 
accidental that the whole society was traumatized by rumors of a 
state coup. Society did not treat it as another canard because 
the idea of coups is hanging in the air. We are waiting for them 
and practically inviting them. 
  Does your experience, your intuition, tell you that these 
coups are becoming a norm in our troubled times? 
  [Kryuchkov] I think we are dealing here with a very 
troublesome phenomenon which perhaps no other country has had to 
face. Efforts are being made to make our public, our people, get 
used to everything that is unusual in normal life, even 
unnatural, impermissible. For instance, a change in a social 
system occurs either as a result of a revolution or with the 
consent of the entire nation. In our country one sociopolitical 
system has been changed or is about to be changed without asking 
anyone. Moreover, we had a referendum on 17 March; we had a 
Union--they simply broke it up. Also, without asking anyone. 
Force is being used in dangerous dimensions. Last year will go 
down in history by its October tragedy, during which hundreds of 
totally innocent people died. We had one coup, then a second, a 
third... Now there is talk of the probability of another coup. 
One gets the impression that there is a group of people trying 
to find a way out of the crisis by the same method of force. 
  I do not think that Yeltsin necessarily is the source; there 
are other people. They want us to get used to the idea that an 
enforcement structures' strike against the forces that allegedly 
are plotting a coup is a logical thing to do. This is the most 
dangerous method of resolving the problems we now face. And at 
the same time they exhort us to reach a peaceful accord... 
  I would like very much for Russia to get rid of such 
cataclysms, and look for a constructive way out of the crisis 
situation. But I am afraid that interested forces may provoke an 
attack against those who do indeed stand for order.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Khamrayev: "Opposition Leaders Once Again </F>
Demanded Unity: General Makashov Offered His Services to Our 
Lord"] 
  [Text] Unity will be finally nailed down in the end of May 
by convening a "national assembly;" the State Duma will support 
"our guys;" the working class, having discovered the unpaid 
wages, will wake up from its hibernation and, forming a solid 
union with the peasants, intelligentsia, and Barkashov's 
confederates, will walk out on a general strike, the crowning of 
which will be restoration of the power of the soviets and the 
fall of the regime of "Judases and Pilates." This was the main 
theme of the literature and arts evening held on Thursday by the 
ZAVTRA newspaper at the Izmaylovo indoor complex. 
  The evening began with declamation of poems, spiritual 
canticles, and folklore collectives' performances, which formed 
an integrated musical-poetic composition and was over while the 
spectators continued to fill the 4,000 floor and bleacher seats 
in accordance with purchased (at 500-2,000 rubles [R] each) 
tickets. The soundtrack of tolling church bells announced the 
beginning of the official part, and a large group of leaders of 
right and left, radical and centrist opposition, whose speeches 
made up the contents of the evening, walked up to the podium. 
The master of ceremonies was Aleksandr Prokhanov. 
  The first production number was Aleksandr Rutskoy. The 
former 
vice president informed viewers that the disparate forces of the 
opposition have been brought together not by thirst for power 
but thirst for a decent life. Mr. Rutskoy expressed his pain for 
Russia, which has lost its status of world power because of 
"Kozyrev and Yeltsin's foreign policy course," which Aleksandr 
Vladimirovich, with an apology to the listener, called 
"bastardly." Then he emphasized once again his desire to 
celebrate the next 9 May under Soviet power, which, in Mr. 
Rutskoy's conviction, will represent people's power in the 21st, 
22d, and 23d and all subsequent centuries." 
  Communist Party of the Russian Federation leader Gennadiy 
Zyuganov complained that over the years of reforms the 
communists were left "without leaders, without money, and 
without office space;" noted that "the communist idea is the 
Russian idea;" and informed the audience that "we have hundreds 
of newspapers, our own administrative and economic managers," 
and insistently demanded of all other leaders that they complete 
mutual consultations before the end of May and convene a 
"national assembly," which will work out a program of joint 
action. 
  In the opinion of Aleksandr Nevzorov, one can clearly see 
that "we definitely have a majority in the State Duma:" In the 
deputy-reporter's words, three-quarters of the Duma members will 
shed a tear "at the sound of the Soviet Union's national 
anthem." The only ones who continue to support the enemy camp 
are the "dem-schizophrenics," whose typical representative is 
Gleb Yakunin. 
  The only woman among the speakers--nun Angelinya from 
Serbia--exhorted Russia: "Wake up!" Being "God's bride," the nun 
insisted on turning "the secret was between Americanism and the 
Slavs, between Zionism and Orthodoxy, into an open war." 
  Albert Makashov brought his own unique flavor to this 
evening 
of literature and arts; he was introduced by Mr. Prokhanov as 
the author of "Suvorov's expression": "...neither mayors, nor 
sirs, nor herrs [peckers]." Drawing a historical analogy between 
the October events of last year and the Kronshtadt and Tambov 
rebellions, the organizer of the storming of the mayoralty and 
Ostankino said no agreements on any accord with "Ye-Be-eN" 
[Yeltsin's initials, which, when spelled this way, form the 
Russian equivalent of "fucking"] are possible. Then, having 
dashingly rapped out: "Yes to the Russian government! Yes to the 
Russian economy!"--Mr. Makashov moved on to the spiritual 
sphere, imparting on the audience his prayer to the Lord "to 
kick out of the Kremlin the crooks, prostitutes, thieves, 
cosmopolitans, and other scum." "And if you are too busy, Lord," 
he continued his tale, "then let me do it!" Albert Makashov 
volunteered to give "his knowledge, his strength, and his rank" 
to the leader who will be able to unite the entire opposition. 
In conclusion, the general informed the audience that he "has 
the honor" and "serves the Soviet Union." 
  Others who voiced their support for the idea of a unified 
opposition with a unified ideology and one leader included Ilya 
Konstantinov, Sergey Baburin, Cossack Captain Viktor Morozov, 
the amnestied "minister of defense" Vladislav Achalov, the 
"glorious GKChP member" Vasiliy Starodubtsev, and Ruslan 
Imranovich Khasbulatov, who sent to the gathering his written 
address. According to Aleksandr Prokhanov, words of solidarity 
were received from Aleksandr Barkashov, who could not attend for 
reason of poor health; Valeriy Zorkin, who "probably was delayed 
by a traffic jam;" and others. 
  The final coda was delivered by Viktor Anpilov. The RCWP 
[Russian Communist Workers Party] leader announced the precise 
date for the all-Russia general strike--it has been moved to 21 
September--and proposed to hold a "primary round of presidential 
elections" by distributing among the population the list of 
candidates from all opposition parties and movements. The 
winner, in Mr. Anpilov's design, will become the sole candidate 
from the unified opposition at the official early presidential 
elections. 
  With this, they parted. The spectators leaving the Izmaylovo 
indoor complex were offered at the door the purchase for R1,500 
of ATTACK--the first issue of the first Russian nationalist 
magazine with a swastika on the cover. The magazine, according 
to those selling it, is intended "only for Aryans" and those "in 
whom the lack of Aryan blood line is compensated for by 
great-power spirit." "Black shirts" were offered a R200 discount.

<F P=106> [Article by Ernst Chernyy, member of the Civic Chamber under </F>
the Russian Federation President, expert for the Association of 
Independent Professionals and candidate in geographical 
sciences: "On the Hobby-Horse of Nationalism One Can Ride Only 
Into the Abyss"] 
  [Text] Anyone who wanted to could, and probably even now 
still can, buy on the street a copy of the newspaper RUSSKIY 
PORYADOK (No. 9, 1 December 1993-January 1994) and learn from it 
that point 5 of the "code of honor" of the Russian National 
Unity provides that: "A fellow brother-in-arms, being a 
full-fledged representative of the Russian Nation, is obligated 
to restore justice in regard to the Russian people through his 
power and his weapon, without appealing to judicial and 
other institutions" (here and henceforth the italics are 
mine--E. Ch.). Point 6 of this same code explains: "The 
brother-in-arms resolves any questions guided only by national 
legal consciousness in accordance with the powers and 
authorities granted to him by the Chief Brother-in-Arms, and 
is not subject to any other laws." The most 
remarkable Point 3 of the code states: "Any encroachment on the 
honor and dignity of a brother-in-arms is a crime 
against the Russian nation." So there you have it! What is 
this--megalomania or someone's angry will, which wants to turn 
the country into a theatre of military operations? Point 14 of 
the code declares: "A brother-in-arms is obliged to always 
remember that Russia has no friends. One who forgets 
this becomes a traitor." This is medieval blackness... Yet it is 
so similar to that which the CPSU [Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union] and the KGB [Committee for State Security] were in their 
time able to do with our country, turning it into an enemy of 
the whole world! On the next-to-last page of this newspaper, 
from the text of this oath which appears very much like a 
military one, we may learn that a brother-in-arms is obligated 
to keep military, national and state secrets. A 
national secret--this is something altogether new. We did not 
experience such a thing even under the leadership of the CPSU 
and the KGB. And since there are national secrets, then, 
naturally, we must "have a cautious attitude toward all persons 
of other faiths and toward foreigners." In short, it is a 
textbook of hate. And this at a time when the United States has 
put an end to racial discrimination, and when the last country 
of classic apartheid, the Republic of South Africa, has embarked 
upon the path of racial conciliation. In our country, along with 
the outward fascists, it is the communists who have taken the 
national idea into their arsenal. 
  The formation of pro-fascist organizations began as early as 
the mid-80's, with the blessings of gorkom [city committee] and 
raykom [rayon committee] functionaries. The CPSU and KGB began 
to formulate groups which had the outward appearance of 
different directionality, and on which they could subsequently 
rely. When the appointed hour struck, the confusion of the true 
CPSU and KGB leaders was short-lived. All went to their 
pre-arranged "apartments"--the various parties, movements and 
fronts. They scattered, like some animal from a fantastic 
fairytale which breaks into many miniature copies of itself at 
the moment of danger. Perhaps only the main headquarters of this 
party and the levers of control are hidden from prying eyes. 
However, it is unlikely that this evokes any doubt among 
attentive observers regarding the existence of a well-managed 
system. The strong anti-democratic communist-nationalist 
newspapers have also been preserved: SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, PRAVDA, 
ZAVTRA and many other smaller ones. 
  Very indicative was the emotional phrase of GKChP [State 
Committee for Extraordinary Situation] Oleg Shenin (former CPSU 
Central Committee member), upon the announcement of cessation of 
work at the last session of the court: "The USSR shall be 
restored!" As they say, they will not haggle over the price. And 
the effort to unite the former Soviet republics will be similar 
to the effort to bring all the powderkegs to one place--closer 
to the bonfire. 
  Without troubling themselves over the reasons for the 
disintegration of the USSR, the national-communists, finding 
their scapegoats in the democrats, essentially never understood 
why the country fell apart. Yet A. Solzhenitsyn knew about this 
even 40 years ago, and not only knew, but wrote about it in the 
"Archipelago" [Arkhipelag GULAG] which, unfortunately, not that 
many of our fellow countrymen have read. (Otherwise, perhaps, 
the elections last December would have gone quite differently.) 
Aleksandr Isayevich wrote the following: "Rulers change. The 
archipelago remains. It remains because this state regime could 
not stand without it. Disbanding the Archipelago, it would 
itself cease to exist." (Arkhipelag GULAG, part 7). The prophecy 
has come to pass: First they liquidated the terrible 
archipelago, and the rest collapsed by itself. The foundation 
disappeared. No, it was not Yeltsin who tore down that old 
building. It could exist only on the foundation of fear and 
camps. So, for a normally thinking person, the consequences 
turned out to be quite predictable. 
  The loud national-communist pseudo-patriots are calling 
Russia not to the future, but to the past--to the musty world of 
totalitarianism of reaction and terror. Yet Russia is a country 
just like Germany or France, except that it had fallen behind 
them by some 300 years due to the Mongol yoke and the extended 
feudalism which was associated with it, whose chains were broken 
only 130 years ago. It is easy to understand that mutual 
guarantee and communal land ownership were necessary to the 
feudal lords in order to keep people who had no rights under 
submission. When the bolsheviks came to power, they merely 
resurrected feudalism in a somewhat different form, replacing 
the landowners with numerous party furers, and the commune with 
kolkhozes. Today the national-communists assure us that this is 
the "Russian way." That means they must again turn the people 
into a mindless herd which they can drive to conquer world 
supremacy, which the Zhirinovskiy followers need so much. 
  For this it is necessary to have enemies, both domestic and 
foreign. In order to find them, the musty national thesis is 
once again dragged out, remarkable in its primitiveness and 
maliciousness, as is, we might add, also the approach to the 
freedom of conscience--the intimate relationship of man with 
God, a sphere where considerable progress has been achieved in 
recent years. From the standpoint of the new specialists on 
freedom of conscience, the nationalists: "Freedom of activity of 
religious confessions, religious communities and individual 
cleriks will be provided only in that measure in which it 
strengthens the spiritual powers of Russians and those living in 
Russia." 
  Yet in pre-revolutionary Russia, the national question as 
such did not exist on a background of religious inequality. 
Today, in connection with the weakening of religion over recent 
decades, the ethnic torch is being fanned. We will note that 
among the irreconcilable active Russian nationalists we may find 
also the half-breed Zhirinovskiy, and this leads us to think 
that the fanning of the nationalist flames is primarily a 
political matter, and only at the lowest level--the level of the 
lumpenized masses--does it take on a primitive nationalist 
coloration. 
  Primitive because it would be laughable to speak of the 
purity of a nation where even the emperor and the nobility were 
not ethnic Russians. The lower strata of society were also not 
ethnically pure in a complete sense--the 300-year Tatar yoke 
stirred everything up. Those whom we today call Russians are a 
mixture of Eastern and Western Slavs, Mongols and Ugro-Finns, 
Khazars and persons of Scandinavian extraction, native residents 
of the North and Siberia and persons of Baltic extraction. There 
is a bit of everything here, and this, we must believe, is not a 
shortcoming, but rather an advantage. And so for this very 
reason, we should hardly seek out ethnic purity today among the 
citizens inhabiting Russia, even in the newspapers ZAVTRA and 
RUSSKIY PUT, and moreover prohibit mixed marriages and consider 
them a crime, as the RNE [Russian National Unity] program calls 
for. At the same time, it seems that one of the forms of 
racism--anti-Semitism--in many cases is still a definite means 
of achieving mercenary political goals. One such example is 
Zhirinovskiy. However, he is not the only one. Entire 
organizations such as the Russian National Council, the Slavic 
Council, the Union of Russian Communities, and the Front for 
National Salvation, not to mention the openly fascist 
organizations, are shamelessly exploiting Russian nationalism 
for their own political purposes. 
  Those who are busy searching out domestic enemies can divide 
citizens into those who are more and less Russian. Therefore, 
today we should fight not for the rights of nations, but for 
human rights. This approach is broader and guarantees protection 
for all. The tendency of slipping into the protection of rights 
by national or linguistic principle will more often hinder than 
help. 
  Nevertheless, the president and the MFA [Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs] as represented by Kozyrev and its other leaders are 
ever more often following the lead of numerous nationalistic 
organizations in speaking of the rights of the Russian and the 
Russian-speaking population, and not about the protection of 
human rights, as is directly provided by the Constitution. The 
protection of Russian and Russian-speaking citizens must be the 
specific case of protection of human rights everywhere, wherever 
they are violated. The success of international and national 
rights protection organizations and their actions has always 
been associated with the emphasis of attention on general human 
rights. 
  Ultimately, we must admit that the idea of statehood on an 
inter-ethnic basis is movement ahead, while the idea of national 
limitation is obvious backward movement, as proven by world 
experience. 
  In conclusion, here is one more quote from the "code of 
honor" of the Russian National Unity, which emphasizes the 
extremely aggressive character of the principles of this 
organization, excluding it from the political sphere and 
relating it to the number of openly terrorist organizations: 
"Persecution of foreign and domestic enemies of the Russian 
Nation, no matter how far beyond the boundaries of Russia they 
may be found, is a matter of honor for the brother-in-arms." We 
may draw our own conclusions. But who must be the first to draw 
them? And where, ultimately, are our wonderful laws which are 
called upon to defend civic peace in the country? 
  Freedom and democracy have come to us over difficult roads. 
Can it be that our imprudence, carelessness and irresponsibility 
will force them to leave our boundaries?

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Protsenko: "Once Again, One Less </F>
Shakhray..."] 
  [Text] We may already compose proverbs about the 
resignations of Sergey Shakhray. Something like: "May has 
come--Shakhray has gone." This is because two years ago, also in 
May, Sergey Mikhaylovich had already submitted his resignation 
from the position of deputy chairman of the government. 
  At that time he left for the president's circle, to engage 
in 
the creation of the GPU [expansion not given], and returned to 
the government only after a year-and-a-half and "through the 
Caucasus," where he tried to smoothe over the sins of another 
deputy chairman of the government, trying to somehow extinguish 
the fire of the Osetin-Ingush conflict. 
  Sergey Mikhaylovich recalls that voluntary resignation 
without any satisfaction. He says, "I demonstrated that I did 
not have a death grip on the minister's portfolio. And what did 
I have to gain? Only a sense of my own moral satisfaction from 
the fact that I showed character." There is some logic in this: 
When you answer for some serious matter, stop and think how your 
personal ambitions will be reflected in this matter. But quite 
recently, last December, Shakhray was once again deprived of the 
post of deputy chairman of the government, and this time not 
through his own will. (Chernomyrdin was ready to take him into 
his renewed command only in the rank of minister), and Sergey 
Mikhaylovich agreed, justifying his decision, among other 
things, by his desire simply to remain on the political scene: 
"If one expects a political future, one cannot absolutely 
distance oneself from power." 
  Five more months went by--and again a resignation. Again a 
voluntary one. "In connection with the appointment of a new 
minister for nationalities affairs and regional policy even 
without a formal consideration of the opinion of the deputy 
chairman of the government who deals with national and regional 
policy, I ask to be relieved of my duties as deputy chairman of 
the Russian Federation Government." 
  So, think what you like about these politicians. He had just 
achieved Chernomyrdin's recognition, gotten back the deputy 
chairmanship, and was introduced into the Security Council. It 
is true, they deprived him of the minister's portfolio, but 
three other "deputies" also do not have one--Oleg Soskovets, 
Aleksandr Zaveryukha, and Yuriy Yarov. Yet Nikolay Travkin, who 
had just been brought into the government as who knows what, 
agreed to the position of "minister without a portfolio." 
Meanwhile, Shakhray retained relations with the mass media on 
the government line (the dream of any politician--to be in 
charge of the press!), interaction with public organizations and 
parties (i.e., the full opportunity to strengthen his own PRES 
[Party for Russian Unity and Accord] at state expense), and also 
no one removed Sergey Mikhaylovich from treatment of questions 
of national and regional policy. 
  "When they dismissed me from the deputy chairmanship, I 
stayed on to work because I had in my hands a ministry which is 
becoming a real instrument for implementation of regional and 
national policy," explained Shakhray. "For the first time the 
ministry had in its hands real levers--money--7.3 trillion 
rubles (R) for food to be brought into the rayons of the Far 
North, R40 billion for aid to Germans in Russia, R20 billion in 
budget funds for the national-cultural rebirth of the peoples of 
Russia..." 
  All of this was "hammered out" by Shakhray. And suddenly 
this 
was "all" given to someone else. And not just to anyone, but in 
essence to his political rival--the head of administration of 
Krasnodar Kray, Nikolay Yegorov, with whom Shakhray had long 
"not formed relations." In such a situation, how can the deputy 
chairman of government be in charge of a minister if the 
minister occupies "an independent place in the structure of 
state power" (that is the status that Shakhray was also 
"hammering out"), and who must even replace his own curator in 
the President's Council on Cadre Policy--a position defined at 
Shakhray's request as being ministerial "in duty," but not 
falling under the deputy chairman of government. In other words, 
now there are no real levers for influencing events in the 
country. It is true, there is a broad field of activity for 
political intrigues. Vladimir Shumeyko, for example, had been in 
such a situation and emerged from it with a large gain. And what 
about Shakhray--did he become insulted? 
  "My resignation does not mean a departure to the opposition 
of the president and the government," Shakhray explained to 
journalists. "It also does not signify any personal insult, 
although I am also a human being and react to the situation as 
any normal person would." 
  Here we should note in parentheses that the PRES leader did 
not coordinate his decision either with the party or with the 
party's faction in the Duma. Even that Tuesday morning, Sergey 
Stankevich announced to journalists that the faction's council 
had decided to forbid Shakhray from leaving the government. At 
the same time, Shakhray himself was already submitting his 
resignation to the chairman of the government. Which, it seems, 
did not make Chernomyrdin very happy. Although Viktor 
Stepanovich had to know what Shakhray's replacement with Yegorov 
in the ministerial post might mean. But... 
  "From a constitutional standpoint, the appointment and 
dismissal of ministers is the prerogative of the president. He 
can do so only at the written nomination of the chairman of 
government. These formalities were upheld, but no more than 
that," Sergey Mikhaylovich explained certain details of his 
resignation from the ministerial post, clearly hinting that 
Chernomyrdin "was not to blame." Then who was? 
  "I would like to hope that the appointment of a new minister 
is not associated with my directive regarding a financial 
investigation within the system of the former Goskomsever [State 
Committee on the Socioeconomic Development of the North], just 
as it is not associated with pressure by various groups in 
Krasnodar Kray and their representatives in Moscow," Shakhray 
stated in his supplemental announcement regarding the reasons 
for his resignation. This phrase can also be called nothing 
other than a hint. Especially its second part--about the "Moscow 
representatives of Kuban," of which Vladimir Shumeyko is 
deservedly considered the leader (and, we might add, a long-time 
patron of Nikolay Yegorov). He has repeatedly announced that 
Boris Yeltsin "consults on cadre questions" specifically with 
him. 
  Then again, Sergey Mikhaylovich has a number of ill-wishers 
also in the president's administration, which would itself like 
to manage and direct the policy in relations with the regions. 
Shakhray believes that the presidential administration's 
management of work with the territories must move away from 
petty patronage of the regions and concentrate on the 
development of political decisions, but... Even the chief of 
this administration, Nikolay Medvedev, who was recently removed 
at the demand of the governors, has once again been appointed as 
acting chief of this same administration. And the edict on 
appointment of a new minister in Shakhray's place was approved 
by Sergey Filatov, with whom Shakhray recently waged a stubborn 
struggle over the conditions of agreement with Chechnya and over 
who, Filatov or Shakhray, should head up the Russian delegation 
at the negotiations. 
  "In principle I never became one of the president's own 
men," 
Sergey Shakhray said almost two years ago, after that first 
resignation. "They reconciled themselves with me, admitted that 
sometimes I would give sound advice and propose fairly good 
draft laws. But on a personal plane, I annoyed many..." We will 
add to this that Sergey Mikhaylovich "annoyed," as a rule, not 
so much his enemies as the people whom he should have considered 
"his own," people from the presidential command, from the 
governmental command. Even at the very beginning of his joint 
work with Boris Yeltsin, when there was a full opportunity to 
select the "lawful" Shakhray as first deputy chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet of Russia, he did not get to become even 
Yeltsin's deputy, "and not without the `help' of Yeltsin's 
closest advisors" (Shakhray's own words). 
  Even later, working within the make-up of the Gaydar and 
Chernomyrdin governments, he often saw (or felt?) what steps 
were being taken by his supposed comrades in arms to move the 
competitor away from the president or the chairman of 
government. "It is not only the jealousy which exists in the 
apparatus that is unpleasant. It is much more unpleasant to 
encounter those methods which the apparatus is ready to use 
under the influence of this jealousy...", admitted Shakhray. But 
he did not go into detail, did not divulge the secrets of the 
"kitchen." "I know everything--I will say nothing!", he once 
waved reporters away at one of the press conferences. 
  Of course, politics has its secrets, and one who has "sold" 
them will later be shunned both by his own and by others. Yet 
one cannot help but ask: What is this "Kremlin kitchen," if 
Shakhray, who even in the Caucasus was more or less able to get 
along with the mutually hostile sides of the Osetin-Ingush 
conflict, could not find even long-term partners in Moscow, in 
the "circles close to the ruling circles." 
  It is true, he was not the only one. A recent study 
conducted 
by the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] Sociology Institute 
regarding the fates of the old nomenklatura in the current 
echelons of power showed how the "old tried and true cadres" are 
invariably returning to their circles, and how the new ones are 
being forced out. Already today among those surrounding Yeltsin 
there are only 10.5 percent of the people who came to power with 
Yeltsin himself or during his time. Thirty-seven percent are 
still holdovers from the Brezhnev era, and 39 percent--from 
Gorbachev's. Even two years ago the picture was entirely 
different. But today there is a definition about the "newcomers" 
as being "democratic flies who have gotten bogged down in the 
thick soup of autocratism." Although by a large account, even 
among the "new flies" far from all are "democrats." 
  We might add that even quite recently the views of Sergey 
Shakhray himself, with only a big stretch, could be called 
"fully democratic." It is enough to remember at least the draft 
law prepared by him in January of '92, "On Ensuring the Effect 
of Russian Federation Legislation," with its specific 
responsibility for actions contradicting the edicts of the 
president and the interests of the Russian Federation. "Under 
this law, if it were adopted now, one could today expand 
whatever one liked, political and physical annihilation of the 
opposition," the then-Minister of Justice Nikolay Fedorov said 
in horror, and ultimately persuaded the president to recall this 
draft law. 
  In Spring of that same year, Shakhray prepared an analytical 
paper for the president, in which he proposed to Boris Yeltsin 
that he announce the possible declaration of a state of 
emergency in the country, although, it is true, in the most 
extreme case. A year later these recommendations became the 
basis for the famous OPUS [Osoboye Poryadok Upravleniya 
Stranoy-play on word ~opus", meaning "work"]. And only now, it 
seems, has Sergey Mikhaylovich's militancy declined, and his 
desire to reach national and social reconciliation has increased. 
  Announcing his resignation, Shakhray advised the president 
and the government to first of all "activate the Agreement on 
Civic Accord so that it would not remain merely on paper, so 
that the coordinating commission which is being created would 
force everyone who signed this agreement to really work..." 
Having listed several other points of the program of action 
which the authorities should have implemented "even yesterday," 
Shakhray predicted that otherwise... 
  "...In July--the first wave of discontent in the defense 
industry collectives and the demonstrations by part of the 
military servicemen and the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. 
The problem, it is true, will resolve itself thanks to vacations 
and summer in general." 
  "But as of August the situation may go into the next phase, 
under which Viktor Chernomyrdin will have to retire. Moreover, 
he will himself have to announce his retirement so as to diffuse 
the situation in society as a whole and in the State Duma in 
particular. Efforts at coordinating the Duma of the new prime 
minister--and there are only three real candidacies: Luzhkov, 
Soskovets and Skokov--these efforts under conditions when the 
Duma will be "revving up" in opposition to the president, will 
lead to activization of the scenarios for disbanding the Duma 
with an effort to announce new elections. Or more precisely, to 
put off the elections altogether in view of the low activity of 
the population." 
  "But suddenly it will turn out that the Duna does not intend 
to disband itself. The Federation Council, upon change of the 
role of the government and the relationship between the 
government and the president, will go over to the president's 
opposition. And the October-December scenario, when the radical 
opposition will act under the principle of "the worse it is, the 
better," raising up the people to a social riot, may repeat the 
worst variant of October of last year..." 
  This is what Sergey Shakhray predicted, stipulating, it is 
true, that this is the "blackest" of all possible scenarios, 
that the president, government and parliament will not allow 
such a thing. He personally remains an optimist and even intends 
to go on his scheduled vacation. 
  Until August?

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Zhirnov: "Skokov Shows His Cards"] </F>
  [Text] On Tuesday, the former secretary of the 
Security Council, and currently the chairman of the Federation 
of Goods Producers of Russia, Yuriy Skokov, made a secret visit 
to the State Duma. 
  His hour-and-a-half long speech to the members of the deputy 
group, "New Regional Policy," about which only this group had 
been given confidential notification, was presented behind 
closed doors, without "outside" deputies or journalists. 
  Perhaps that is for the best. Skokov's evaluations of the 
other Duma factions and the lower chamber as a whole were rather 
unflattering. The State Duma is as yet "not a parliament, but a 
party club," a mechanical conglomerate of party factions which 
"are not accountable to anyone." On the contrary, the NRP ["New 
Regional Policy"] group, in Skokov's interpretation, is the 
bulwark and hope not only for parliament, but to a certain 
degree for all of Russia. Reminding them that he "took an active 
part in the stage of formulation of the group," Skokov called it 
the "nucleus, the beginnings of the structure of representative 
power in the entire country." 
  Such complementary interpretations ran through Yuriy 
Vladimirovich's entire political philosophy and program of 
action. The fact is that he has a rather low opinion of the 
party system of current-day Russia in general. In his opinion, 
parties do not have serious programs and principles. They are 
created "under surnames" for the purpose of realizing the 
political ambitions of these "surnames." Therefore, there is no 
sense for Skokov, as any rational and responsible politician, to 
build yet another party on the basis, for example, of the 
Federation of Goods Producers. Rather, it is necessary to create 
a "system of interaction" between deputies who share a single 
mandate and who have ties in the regions, with the 
representative and executive powers of the territories, the 
regional unions of the Federation of Goods Producers, and with 
the local intellectual and professional elite. This is the 
"non-governmental, non-state" technocratic--in opposition to the 
party--system, which can organize the country's emergence from 
its historic dead end. In the name of its development, Yuriy 
Skokov offered the deputies his cooperation "in any form," 
specially stipulating that it should not be limited to the field 
of lawmaking. 
  Having understood the sense of the proposed deal, the 
parliamentarians stopped to think. Despite the attractiveness of 
the proposal, despite the respect which they had for the name of 
the speaker, the "regionalists" were clearly concerned by the 
problem: What does Skokov actually represent in the political 
plane? Yuriy Vladimirovich, who previously expressed his 
readiness to run for president, this time avoided responding to 
the question of whether he sees himself as a future leader of 
the country. Then at least they would like to know what his 
"hosts and home fronts" are! 
  Skokov gave a rather detailed listing of the collective 
members of the Federation of Goods Producers which he heads up, 
noting that he includes in this category "all persons at the 
local sites who create material wealth." However, in response to 
the specific question of whether he has a group of persons 
capable of working with the NRP on the formation of a 
socio-political movement, he gave an expansive answer from which 
it followed that, in general, he does not have such a group. 
"Only individual persons are emerging." On the whole, however, 
the cadre problem is the most complex, and that is why he has 
appealed to the "regionalist" deputies. 
  It seems that after the "secret meeting," the 
parliamentarians understood what was wanted of them, but never 
did understand who stands behind Skokov. Is it only his 
legendary humility which explains the fact that he stubbornly 
stays in the shadows? Did he not rush to the deputy group as his 
last hope? Or, in fact, is this a leader who only needs some 
link, some Archimedes key, to turn Russia upside down? 
  In any case, it is obvious that Skokov has seen in the "New 
Regional Policy" more than simply a duma faction. Perhaps he has 
seen a sort of "micro-soviet of the Federation" in the State 
Duma, a channel of power for emergence into the regions which he 
lost when he left the post of head of the Security Council and 
did not find in the Federation of Goods Producers, which he 
currently heads up. And so he decided to make use of the actual 
and imagined potentials of the deputy group. 
  There are varying opinions about these potentials. Some 
believe that the NRP is a "union of unattached persons." Others 
believe it to be a powerful government lobby in parliament. If 
the latter is true, then Yuriy Vladimirovich has presented his 
listeners with a serious choice. It is not overly disposed to 
the current government and its head, and critizes it not only 
for its failures in the economy, but also "from personal 
positions." The Federation of Goods Producers long ago proposed 
that Chernomyrdin sign the "agreement on interaction," and even 
the president had a "rather positive" attitude toward this. 
However, the "government is silent." Therefore, Skokov, for his 
part, does not want to sign the Agreement on Civil Accord. 
  Thus, it has been suggested in cautious form that the Duma 
"regionalists" define themselves. It is hard to say how 
difficult this choice is for them in the ideological plane, 
since in any case it is not a choice in favor of "classic 
democracy." Because while Viktor Stepanovich embodies the power 
of the "director-privatizers" in the eyes of many, the outline 
presented by Yuriy Vladimirovich is a second variant of the 
"nomenklatura renaissance," which casts off as being unneeded 
the inalienable attribute of democracy--the leading role of the 
party in the political process. 
  And finally. Is it by chance that Yuriy Skokov's blitz-visit 
to the Duma coincided in time with the news of the resignation 
of Sergey Shakhray, a long-time rival of Yuriy Vladimirovich in 
the field of regional policy? Among the "regionalists" in the 
Duma, Shakhray enjoyed the authority of being a practical man 
who helped to solve specific questions of the territories. "With 
Shakhray one could discuss the problem of the 'norths.' Now 
Shakhray is gone. Do you know this problem?", one of the 
deputies asked Skokov. "I know it very well," he accepted the 
challenge.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Shokarev, VTsIOM [All-Union Center for </F>
the Study of Public Opinion]: "If We Were To Elect the President 
Tomorrow, It Would Be Yeltsin; Yavlinskiy and Zhirinovskiy Are 
Breathing Down His Neck"] 
  [Text] According to the data of VTsIOM [All-Union Center 
for the Study of Public Opinion0, obtained in the course of a 
survey of the urban population of Russia at the request of the 
newspaper SEGODNYA, if the early presidential elections were to 
be held next Sunday, approximately one-fourth of the votes would 
be distributed as follows: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Yeltsin                               |14| 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Yavlinskiy                            |8| 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Zhirinovskiy                          |7| 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Rutskoy                               |5| 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Gaydar                                |3| 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The list given to the respondents also contained the names 
of 
other political leaders, which may be united into three groups: 
  First--the populist-democrats: Mikhail Gorbachev, Gavriil 
Popov, Nikolay Travkin, Anatoliy Sobchak and Svyatoslav Fedorov. 
7 percent of the respondents were ready to vote for them. 
  Second--the pro-government leaders: Viktor Chernomyrdin, 
Sergey Shakhray and others. They collected 5 percent. 
  Last--the leaders of the irreconcilable opposition: Sergey 
Baburin, Gennadiy Zyuganov and Aman Tuleyev. Their supporters 
numbered 3 percent. 
  The other politicians collected an insignificant number of 
votes. 
  Around 15 percent of the respondents declined to answer the 
question. 
  Boris Yeltsin leads in practically all the socio-demographic 
groups. The only exception is managers, specialists, students 
and the unemployed. In the first group, Aleksandr Rutskoy is in 
first place, and in the next two Grigoriy Yavlinskiy is the 
leader, while unemployed persons give preference to Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy. This represents an alarming symptom, considering 
the possible sharp increase in unemployment already this year. 
  Among several of the groups, the leader of the LDPR 
[Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] edges out Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy from second into third place. Thus, he is preferred 
by men as a whole, blue-collar workers, persons with little 
education, as well as those with per capita monthly income below 
50,000 rubles (R). 
  The former vice president is in stable fourth position, but 
among white-collar workers and students he is more popular than 
Zhirinovskiy. They place him in the third position, as do 
persons with per capita monthly income of from R100,000 to 
R149,000. We must add also that in such an important region as 
Moscow, Aleksandr Rutskoy is in second place, attracting the 
sympathies of 7 percent of Moscow residents. However, the 
positions of Boris Yeltsin are strongest in the capital--here 22 
percent of the respondents are ready to vote for him. 
  Yegor Gaydar makes it into the top three only in groups of 
entrepreneurs and among persons with income above R150,000. 
  Table 1 presents the results in greater detail. 
  For the present day, the president maintains the leading 
positions among urban residents, yielding them in groups with 
low level of adaptation. Moreover, the democratically oriented 
"unadapted" persons choose Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, while Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy wins out among those who have found themselves in 
the worst situation. These two politicians aspire to second 
place in the presidential race. Their chances of winding up in a 
hypothetical run-off are equal. Aleksandr Rutskoy, who was right 
behind the leader, i.e., the president, up until September of 
last year, has fallen behind and has been unable to regain the 
second position in the months following the day of dismissal. 
Yegor Gaydar has practically no chance to enter the finals. Even 
among those who voted for the "Choice of Russia" block in 
December of 1993, 40 percent gave their sympathies to Boris 
Yeltsin, and only 11 percent would vote for the leader of the 
block.

  Table 2 presents the structure of values which respondents 
consider to be the most important for Russia and its future. The 
first column presents the responses of all the population, the 
second gives the responses of those who at the hypothetical 
elections would vote for Boris Yeltsin, and so forth (see 
table). As we can see, the overwhelming majority of the 
respondents consider the most important thing to be "law and 
order and legality." This demand unites all the groups, with the 
exception of the supporters of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. If we 
consider that the latter put the need for a "strong leader" in 
first place, evidently they believe that if there will be such a 
leader (Zhirinovskiy), he will bring about order. Ranking second 
is the "social protection of the population," whose importance 
evokes practically no doubt in anyone. Here again, the 
supporters of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy comprise the exception. 
  The demand for "strong authority, a real leader," which is 
ranked third in importance, fully reflects the paternalistic 
tendencies retained in society. Then again, no one wants to 
reject such a concept as "adherence to human rights and 
freedoms," which 10 years earlier was no more than a "figure of 
speech." 
  We must remember that the proposed responses represent a 
certain stamp, but their meanings vary depending on the values 
of the respondent. The most obvious example of this is the 
attitude of supporters of Boris Yeltsin and Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, 
on one hand, and those of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Aleksandr 
Rutskoy on the other to the concept of a "hard, freely 
convertible ruble." While the former believe that a convertible 
ruble may be achieved only under a "free market economy" (for 
them it is always more important than the "ruble"), the latter 
understand the "convertible ruble" as a ruble which is ordered 
to be convertible--a set ruble exchange rate and fixed prices. 
The concept of a "free market economy" does not even enter into 
the top ten priorities for supporters of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
and Aleksandr Rutskoy. 
  Behind the concept of "good neighborly relations with other 
countries and peoples," there is hidden the well-known 
expression, "just so there is no war." It is interesting that 
the supporters of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, and especially 
Aleksandr Rutskoy, are ready to part with such relations for 
purposes of "restoring the USSR and Soviet power." 
  One thing that draws attention to itself is the fact that 
the 
supporters of the leader of the LDPR--the only ones out of all 
the groups--believe such a concept as a "Russian national state" 
to be important. They have ranked it in fourth place, while for 
the others it is not even in the top ten priorities. 
  Summarizing all of the above, we may say that the proponents 
of one or another political leader are quite similar to their 
chosen candidate. Their collective portraits appear 
approximately as follows: 
  The "Yeltsinists"--compared with the population as a whole 
or 
with the proponents of other leaders--are more pro-market and 
pro-democratically oriented. The "Yavlinists" are rather similar 
to the proponents of Yeltsin, although for them "social 
fairness" is more important than "social protection of the 
population." In other words, they are populists to a greater 
degree than are the "Yeltsinists." the "Zhirinovtsy" are 
supporters of a firm hand and a Russian national state. However, 
they cannot be considered "red" in the same degree as the 
supporters of the former vice-president. On the other hand, 
Aleksandr Rutskoy is specifically the leader of the "reds," at 
least for the present moment. 
  The survey was conducted at the request of the newspaper 
SEGODNYA from 14 through 18 May, using a representative sampling 
of the urban population of Russia. A total of 1,620 persons were 
polled.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Podberezkin, head of the author's </F>
collective of the "National Doctrine of Russia" by Olga 
Sapozhnikova, date and place not given: "The `National Doctrine 
of Russia'"] 
  [Text] This is the title of the voluminous work, prepared 
and published very recently by the RAU-Corporation. The 
president of this well-known scientific research organization 
and leader of the authors' collective Aleksey Podberezkin 
answers the questions of our correspondent Olga Sapozhnikova. 
  [Sapozhnikova] What basic factor influenced the publication 
of your book at such a complicated time? 
  [Podberezkin] In Russia today all the problems are closely 
intertwined: There cannot be economics without spirituality, 
there cannot be military security without ecological security 
and so on. The contemporary Russian idea with an answer to 
these questions should find its expression in the formulation of 
a national doctrine. (The Russian idea is more than a 
geographical concept--it reflects the interests of all citizens 
living on the territory of contemporary Russia and within the 
boundaries of the former USSR.) Our work is an attempt to bring 
together and to show in its interdependence a strategic 
conception of the development of our state at the current time. 
  [Sapozhnikova] The "Russian idea" is a claim to a definite 
ideology. In the title of the book there are the words 
"National Doctrine." One recalls immediately the lexicon of 
American presidents. What is the genre of your book? 
  [Podberezkin] If one proceeds from the fact that a doctrine 
is an aggregate of officially adopted views toward common 
national goals and the ways to achieve them, then, of course, it 
is not an official document because it was prepared by 
non-official structures. It is more a practical attempt to 
inspire the process of forming a national doctrine. 
  [Sapozhnikova] What can representatives of the political 
establishment find in a book entitled "The National Doctrine of 
Russia?" 
  [Podberezkin] In our book the key feature is the development 
of the factor of spirituality as a condition for resolving all 
the remaining problems. To establish the priority of the 
problems, having determined them and analyzed their situation 
today, and to give some hardly inarguable variants for resolving 
them--that is our task. 
  [Sapozhnikova] Society in our country today is seriously 
splintered. How can your book influence this situation? 
  [Podberezkin] One of the most important tasks of our work is 
to show realistically this problem of society's splintering and 
possible prospects for overcoming it. The nation faces a choice: 
either we will develop according to the Georgian scenario, 
where the sides cannot come to an agreement and sooner or later 
a violent confrontation will begin, which acquires its own 
internal logic and in the end everyone forgets who fired first; 
or we will not have civil war. It is necessary to do everything 
so that the first variant does not develop. This requires 
serious efforts on all sides. Here the main difficulty is how 
and to what degree to arrive at a compromise. 
  [Sapozhnikova] A national doctrine begins with the fact that 
a nation forms for itself an ideal of development. You call 
spirituality such an ideal. But we are also split over the 
question of spirituality. There are forces who consider that 
Russia is an uncivilized country and that it is necessary for us 
to be integrated into "world civilization." And there are those 
who are activiely seeking the ideal of spirituality in the 
15th-16th centuries. As long as society will not achieve 
agreement regarding an ideal of development, the remaining 
problems will bear a secondary character. 
  [Podberezkin] Problem number 1 is the achievement of an 
agreed-upon spiritual ideal. We are Eurasian. From a 
geopolitical point of view we are located in the center of a 
continent, unique in its historical, geographical and cultural 
features, and we should work out our own model of development, 
our own world view. In it the primary role belongs to the 
spiritual factor, which is coompletely unrecognized by the 
supporters of the Western model of development. Our mentality 
wull be formed on the basis of our historical and cultural 
traditions... 
  [Sapozhnikova] The "new Russians" don't think so. 
  [Podberezkin] A large part, but not all of the "new 
Russians" 
support the comprador model of development. These people take 
for themselves the values, lets say, of Austria or Holland. If 
it works out for one of them to become Austrian or Dutch, which, 
frankly speaking, I doubt, then good; if it doesn't work out, 
which I am to a greater degree convinced of, that person, 
whether there or here will be a foreign body. 
  The spiritual and ieological factors form the basis of the 
development of our state both in the future, and in economics. 
  If we use both of them, we will come to the unavoidable 
conclusion that we can solve economic and social problems. But 
now these factors are simply not taken into account. Financial 
culture, education, science, the current tax system--these are 
the destruction of the nation's spirituality, the destruction of 
the factor which can lead society out of the crisis. 
  [Sapozhnikova] A national doctrine is an all-society 
agreement. It presupposes the presence of a conscious group of 
interests. We have still not formulated them, the social 
structure of our society is changing: there are the "new 
Russians," the criminal associations...How to move society 
toward a realization of its common interests? 
  [Podberezkin] An original conclusion from this situation was 
proposed in our work. If we view the political party spectrum 
according to its interests, we see that agreement is practically 
impossible. The interests of these strata are varied and it is 
very difficult to find a social-political basis on which to 
unite them. If we try to look at society according to a 
different spectrum, dividing it into a system of priorities of 
all-national interests, having removed the party factor of 
personality and ambition, society will be divided into two 
camps. The first are the state patriots, seeing their Russia as 
a strong great power with a developed economic structure, 
intellectually and economically independent. Therefore in this 
camp there will be some supporters of the president, of 
parliament, and followers of your newspaper. 
  In the second camp are the compradors. What Russia will be 
is all the same to them. 
  [Sapozhnikova] How did the work on preparing "The National 
Doctrine of Russia" proceed? 
  [Podberezkin] The first version of the work, presented as a 
document on the strategy of national security was conceived and 
completed in two weeks. 
  After the book was printed and we began to get reactions it 
became clear that the work was not finished. In the course of a 
month we produced its expanded version. Nearly 300 people, 
leading specialists in their areas, to a greater or lesser 
degree participated in preparing the final text (the creative 
collective directly). These experts are well known and 
recognized not because they have big titles or because they 
often appear on television, but first of all they are respected 
in their professional field. Among the authors is Nikita 
Nikolayevich Moiseyev, a star of the first magnitude, and other 
well known names. 
  [Sapozhnikova] Did "Group Most" finance the work? 
  [Podberezkin] Not completely. The work was done on an equal 
footing, since our corporation took upon itself a large part of 
the financing. "Group Most" paid for printing. Without 
financial support we would not have been able to publish the 
book--there was not enough money.

<F P=106> [Article by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent: "A Quarter </F>
Kopek for a Heifer, Transit for a Ruble; Some Heads of 
Administration Do Not Want the Public To Know Its Rights?" 
  [Text] According to the presidential edict, all legislative 
statutes, government decrees and documents signed by the 
president become effective upon publication in ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA. That means free access to our newspaper is one of the 
inalienable civil rights. The censorship of the department does 
not exist today, but a barrier which has arisen between the 
newspaper and the reader is the censorship of the pocketbook, 
which may also be administatively controlled. 
  The newspaper does not get to the reader by itself. It is 
delivered by mail. And in addition to the subscription price, 
the postal service sets its price for delivery. While the 
editors of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA determine the first price, the 
second is determined in each region independently. The 9,000 
rubles (R) for half a year set by the editors does not cover 
expenses for maintaining and publishing the newspaper (a ton of 
paper today costs R780,000, and no one knows what it will be in 
6 months). However, the post offices have a special methodology 
for computing the price to cover their expenditures. 
  Then what explains such sharp variations today? For example, 
in Samara Oblast (where K. Titov is head of administration) they 
charge R15,600 for delivery of RG, while nearby in Saratov 
Oblast (head of administration Yu. Belykh) it is R10,396. Since, 
according to the methodology, transport expenditures are among 
the primary components of the price for delivery, we can only 
assume that in Saratovo Oblast the roads are better and shorter, 
and the gasoline is cheaper than in the neighboring oblast. 
Which is absurd if we remember Griboyedov's address in the 
"sticks" and the presence of well-developed oil processing and 
local gasoline in Samara Oblast. And how can we explain that in 
the neighboring Penza Oblast (head of administration A. 
Kovlyagin) they charge R4,500 for six months of delivery of our 
newspaper, but for the same operation with the "ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA Collection" they already charge R30,000? 
  One more inexplicable difference is in the delivery to 
individual subscribers versus organizations. In Kaluga Oblast 
(head of administration A. Deryagin), offices are charged as 
much as R23,400 for the newspaper, while in Belgorod Oblast 
(head of administration Ye. Savchenko) they charge R12,000. 
According to V. V. Gogoleva, department head of the Federal 
Postal Service Administration, the newspaper is delivered to 
organizations with the aid of the GSP [city postal service] 
system, which is about two times more expensive than the 
ordinary mail. But why more expensive by different amounts? 
Viktoriya Viktorovna believes that prices are higher where the 
ordinary population is subsidized at the expense of 
organizations. 
  And here we must go from the postmen to the heads of 
administration. Since, in view of the open-field system of 
postal price lists, it turns out that, in places where prices 
are low, the administration knowingly subsidizes the delivery of 
a newspaper which publishes documents and commentaries which are 
of vital importance to all of Russia. We may say this about 
Bryansk Oblast (head of administration V. Karpov), where 
delivery costs R2,760; about Krasnodar Kray (recent head of 
administration N. Yegorov)--R4,668, and about Tuva (president 
Sherit-ool Oorzhak) and Karachayevo-Cherkesiya (Council of 
Ministers Chairman V. Khubiyev). And in those regions where 
prices are high, the administration, frightening the public away 
from subscriptions, is facilitating the breakdown of all-Russian 
ties and in practice conceals from the citizens the federal laws 
and decrees, leaving them in the field of arbitrary activity of 
local authorities. That is what they do in Vologda Oblast (head 
of administration N. Podgornov), where the price of delivery is 
R18,510, in Mordovia (Council of Ministers Chairman V. 
Shvetsov)--R11,046, and in Moscow (Mayor Yu. Luzhkov)--R8,800. 
  However, the most pleasant thing is that in the places where 
the local authorities are truly active in a positive way, there 
no barriers are set for the governmental newspaper. Without any 
prompting, benefits have been introduced for subscribers in 
Kabardino-Balkariya (President V. Kokov), while in Kaliningrad 
Oblast, an isolated little island of Russia, they even solve the 
problem of employment with the aid of benefits. At the decision 
of the oblast administration (head of administration Yu. 
Matochkin), delivery is half as expensive for those newspapers 
which are printed in Kaliningrad itself. 
  We might add, about the press. We are even published in 
Cheboksary. However, there they charge both citizens and 
organizations the same for delivery--R22,800. Moreover, the 
price is the same for rural residents and for city residents 
living within 100 meters from the printing-house or the post 
office. While in Chelyabinsk, for example, the city price is 
R9,200, while in the oblast it is R15,594.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Katukov, manager of the Department </F>
for Organizational-Technical Support of the Activity of the 
Government of the Russian Federation, by Yuriy Mikhaylov; place 
and date not given: "Privileges Have Ended. Forget about Them!"] 
  [Text] [Mikhaylov] It is known that the government staff 
has been reorganized. But what has happened to the traditional 
nomenklatura privileges of the current civil servants? We have 
fought for so long and fiercely against them that, in principle, 
we were supposed to have abolished privileges a long time ago... 
  [Katukov] If you will permit me, first about the 
reorganization of the staff of the Government of the Russian 
Federation. In our view, the staff has become more compact and 
significantly more efficient. A number of subdivisions have been 
eliminated, and now the staff of the Government of Russia 
consists of 17 departments and three directorates (juridical, 
organizational-technical, and record-keeping directorates) and 
the secretariats of the chairman of the Government of the 
Russian Federation and his deputies. 
  As for "privileges," let us agree on terms. Take a computer, 
typewriter, or a dictaphone for a journalist--are these 
privileges, or instruments that are necessary for work? It is 
generally recognized that "privileges" are a certain kind of 
additional or above-norm advantages or benefits, if you wish, 
that have nothing to do with the nature of the work. This 
relates in different degrees to a worker, a farmer, and an 
office employee, including a government official. Everything a 
government official needs, depending on the volume and nature of 
the work he performs, is stipulated and described in special 
documents. 
  [Mikhaylov] Telephone apparatuses with special 
communications 
were always the pride of the former party nomenklatura. As far 
as I know, they have not vanished even now. Who has the right 
today to use "secure government communications" with the state 
seal on the dial disk? 
  [Katukov] With respect to special communications, the circle 
of persons who have the right to use it is regulated by the 
"List of Positions of Managerial Workers of the Russian 
Federation That Are Furnished Governmental Communications." 
  [Mikhaylov] But precisely what is this kind of 
communications? 
  [Katukov] Precisely telephones of the government ATS 
[Automated Telephone Station] that are commonly called "secure 
government communications," which guarantee confidentiality in 
conversations both within the bounds of the city of Moscow and 
between cities (PM-communications--government long-distance). 
  [Mikhaylov] What are the staff salaries of senior government 
officials now? 
  [Katukov] Staff salaries are established by an authorized 
staff schedule. In accordance with this document, a federal 
minister has a salary of 312,000 rubles [R]. The rest of the 
existing percentage additions to position salary are for 
difficult and special work regimes and an addition for length of 
service similar to that which exists in other state institutions 
and enterprises. 
  [Mikhaylov] And what are the salaries of the president and 
the prime minister? 
  [Katukov] The staff salary of the president of the Russian 
Federation is R467,900, and of the chairman of the 
government--R422,400. Practically no government makes a secret 
of this, and ours is no exception. 
  [Mikhaylov] To whom in the Government of Russia is a 
personal 
car now available? 
  [Katukov] In answering your question, I would like to note 
immediately that the question concerns official motor vehicle 
transport exclusively. On the staff of the Government of the 
Russian Federation this right is possessed by chiefs of 
departments and directorates, managers of the secretariats of 
the chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation and his 
deputies, and assistants (advisers) of the chairman of the 
Government of the Russian Federation. 
  [Mikhaylov] And the ministers? 
  [Katukov] Federal ministers and the directors of other 
federal departments of the Russian Federation also have the 
right to use official motor vehicle transport year round in 
accordance with the nature and volume of their work. As a rule, 
this is a Volga GAZ 3102 or GAZ 31029. 
  [Mikhaylov] But some ride in Mercedes? I wonder who? 
  [Katukov] Still fresh in our memory are the times when an 
enormous number of government ZIL's and Chayka's--which the 
people called "member-carriers" [chlenovoz]--were driven around 
Moscow. The picture is different today. It is no secret that the 
operation of that same armored government ZIL is not comparable 
to the financial costs of the foreign make that you mentioned 
and is not in the domestic limousine's favor. The assignment of 
a Mercedes to higher staff personnel is made through special 
decisions. This decision was made in the Government of Russia 
with respect to the first deputy chairman of the Government of 
the Russian Federation and the managers of federal, commonly 
so-called "power," ministries and departments: Defense, Internal 
Affairs, Foreign Affairs, the Foreign Intelligence Service, and 
the Federal Counterintelligence Service. 
  [Mikhaylov] And who is supposed to have a security guard? 
  [Katukov] Guaranteeing the safety of senior government 
officials also presupposes a security guard for the chairman of 
the Government of the Russian Federation, his deputies, and the 
managers of the "power" ministries and departments mentioned 
above. 
  [Mikhaylov] What is happening now with the former fourth 
Main 
Directorate of the USSR Ministry of Health? At one time its 
splendid polyclinics served the party elite. And now? 
  [Katukov] If you have no objection, I would make a 
correction--not only the "party elite" but also workers of the 
central staffs of the former CPSU Central Committee and the 
Council of Ministers. 
  At the present time it is the Medical Center under the 
Government of the Russian Federation that serves the workers of 
the central staffs of the Federal Assembly, the president's 
office, the government, and the Supreme Court, the 
Constitutional Court, and the Court of Arbitration, and, also, 
as before, a number of institutions of culture, science and 
education, and specific individuals whose services were 
especially noted by the state. 
  [Mikhaylov] But what about government dachas? Who is now 
supposed to get a year-round suburban dacha? 
  [Katukov] The existing "Statute on Procedure for Granting 
Accommodations for Rest in Dacha Communities and in Pension and 
Rest Homes" provides for year-round paid use of dachas. This 
right is given to those officials who also get an official 
vehicle. The exception are assistants (advisers) to the chairman 
of the Government of the Russian Federation who are granted rest 
accommodations in the summer period. 
  [Mikhaylov] And ministers? 
  [Katukov] Ministers and managers of federal organs of the 
executive branch also have the right to year-round use of dachas 
that are within the jurisdiction of the administration of 
affairs of the president of the Russian Federation, but their 
deputies do not. 
  In addition, the area granted is in accordance with the size 
of the family, and payment is in cash. 
  [Mikhaylov] What is the situation now with distributors for 
special clientele? I have in mind special food rations, special 
sections in GUM [state department store], and special shops. 
  [Katukov] Let us ask ourselves the question: "What is the 
feasibility of maintaining special clientele distributors, given 
existing real life in Moscow? After all, practically everything 
can be bought now in a regular store. There are no longer any 
kind of special food rations and special sections. The network 
of shops, it is true, remains. You can have whatever you like 
made for yourself, but for your own hard-earned money. For 
example, to have a two-piece suit made costs a client 
R180-200,000 on the average, regardless of the official's 
position. 
  [Mikhaylov] Does it not seem to you that for a majority of 
government officials all these telephones, vehicles, and dachas 
also give genuine meaning to their activity and are a measure of 
their success in life? 
  [Katukov] I would not be sincere even with myself if I did 
not answer unambiguously. Unquestionably, a layer of such civil 
servants remains on the staff, nevertheless, the main part of 
the staff of the Government of the Russian Federation consists 
of respectable people, professionals. For these people, all the 
things we have talked about are only an instrument in their 
work--the government communications telephone, the presence or 
absence of an official motor vehicle, or a dacha, never was and 
never will be a criterion of their success in life. They could 
have left a long time ago for "big money" and specifically for 
the "benefits" that exist in other jobs with their numerous 
"privileges." It seems to me that what "holds" them here is a 
feeling of duty, inculcated by years of state service, and an 
understanding of the fact that their experience and knowledge 
are necessary now as never before. 
  As for state employees who live with other categories and 
values in life, the present day indicates that with the 
emergence of new and increased demands in their work, people 
like this do not last, and they leave. 
  [Mikhaylov] Do you consider that a government staff employee 
position is a profession? 
  [Katukov] Actually, this is so. Moreover, I am convinced 
that 
this is one of the difficult professions. If for no other reason 
than that everyone has to master its ABC's on the job; after 
all, we do not have diplomaed state civil servants, and higher 
educational institutions do not train them. 
  And, by the way, my first specialty is military doctor. What 
I am engaged in now in the service is a result of daily training 
in the school of the government staff over several years. I do 
not consider it a disgrace to learn and exchange experiences 
among one's colleagues. 
  [Mikhaylov] What do you think is paramount in this 
profession? 
  [Katukov] Veracity, a sense of duty, and a sense of 
obligation.

<F P=106> [Article by IZVESTIYA writer Yuriy Fefofanov: "Who Will Be </F>
Judged for What in Russia"] 
  [Text] As a general rule, criminal codes consist of 
two halves: "General Part" and "Special Part." The first half 
gives the basic principles of criminal legislation; this is its 
philosophy. The second part enumerates the criminally punishable 
acts and the punishments corresponding to them. We shall now 
discuss the "General Part" of the craft Criminal Code--it was 
developed by the Ministry of Justice and the president's State 
Legal Administration. 
  Will discussion in parliament get around to this draft? 
It is hard to say. The Criminal Code in general is having a hard 
time. The 1960-model code, which is still in effect, is 
obsolete. A draft appeared in 1991--it was published in the 
journal ZAKON. It was never even discussed. And here is a new 
draft. 
  Doctors of Jurisprudence S.G. Kelina and I.M. Galperin 
helped in the expert assessment of the draft Criminal Code. 
<H5>  What Is Crime? </H5>
  Criminal law must first of all answer this "simple" 
question. How is it to be distinguished from the host of human 
actions which, although they may be of a negative nature, do not 
warrant jail and certainly not "the noose"? 
  The Criminal Code now in effect: 
  "A crime shall be deemed to be a socially dangerous act 
(action or inaction) specified by criminal law which threatens 
the social structure of the USSR, its political and economic 
systems, socialist property, the individual, and political, 
labor, property, and other rights and freedoms of citizens...." 
  It is interesting to compare this with the draft of the 1913 
Criminal Code, which was not adopted either. 
  "A crime shall be an action or inaction specified by the 
present code that is dangerous to the socialist state of workers 
and peasants or the socialist law and order established in it." 
Protection of the individual is not mentioned at all--only the 
"state of workers and peasants" is protected. 
  And what does the present draft have to say about crime? 
  "A crime shall be deemed to be an act prohibited by criminal 
law under the threat of punishment. Socially dangerous shall be 
deemed to be an act that causes or creates the possibility of 
causing harm to objects protected by criminal law." 
  In the first three definitions of crime there are the 
"society" and the "state," which inevitably politicizes the 
point of departure of all criminal legislation. But do the 
society and state have to protect themselves. Undoubtedly. But 
then is it possible to avoid "politics"? It seems to me that 
this was done in the draft of the 1991 Criminal Code which never 
reached the point of discussion. 
  It seems that the authors of the draft managed to enclose 
the 
definition of a crime within a purely legal framework and yet it 
is fairly exhaustive. 
  So is it worthwhile to give a very great deal of thought to 
such a "simple" thing as the definition of a crime; to weigh 
everything on the most precise scales so that in the list of 
specific acts and punishments there will be no loophole for 
arbitrariness. "Theoretical" imprecision in practice leads to 
derailing the proceedings of the State Committee of the Russian 
Federation on the Administration of State Property and 
justification of political violence. The Roman principle "nullum 
crimen sine lege" (there is no crime unless it is indicated in 
the law) proclaimed by the compiler of the draft of the Criminal 
Code must be upheld to the end in all its purity... 
<H5>  The Death Penalty for the Firm </H5>
  Criminal liability of legal entities is something new 
and unusually for our law. That is, not living people but 
organizations may be sentenced to criminal punishment. It seemed 
to me that this breaks away from the general principles of 
criminal law. 
  CHAPTER 16. CRIMINAL LIABILITY OF LEGAL ENTITIES 
  Article 106. Grounds for criminal liability. 
  (1) A legal entity shall be subject criminal liability for 
acts specified by criminal law if: 
  a) the legal entity is guilty of failing to fulfill or 
fulfilling improperly a direct prescription of the law, which 
establishes the obligation or prohibition to conduct certain 
activity; 
  b) a legal entity is guilty of conducting activity that does 
not correspond to its constituent documents or declared 
objectives; 
  c) an act that caused harm or created the threat of causing 
harm to an individual, the society, or the state was committed 
in the interests of the given legal entity or was allowed, 
sanctioned, approved, or used by an organ or individual 
performing the functions of management of the legal entity. 
  2. The criminal liability of a legal entity shall not 
preclude the liability of the individual for his commission of a 
crime. 
  Article 107. Types of punishment. 
  (1) As basic punishments it is possible to impose fines, 
prohibit engaging in a particular kind of activity, or liquidate 
the legal entity. 
  (2) As additional punishment it is possible to prohibit a 
particular activity or confiscate property. 
  "Is the innovation of criminal liability of a legal entity 
not flouting the very foundations of criminal law? An individual 
and not the organization is responsible for the act. Only the 
Nuremberg Tribunal accused an organization of a crime. Is that 
not so?" 
  "No," says the person with whom I was talking, "the legal 
systems of many countries stipulate the liability of legal 
entities: England, America, France. And we have an extreme need 
for this. Take ecological crimes--it is not enough for only the 
officials to be responsible. Or legal violations regarding 
taxes. And all the 'Panama affairs' with checks, auctions, and 
deposits. Or the mass media: Certain newspapers are directly 
calling for violence and war. The measures specified by civil 
legislation are clearly inadequate." 
  "But will individuals who are guilty of crimes not hide 
behind legal entities? Remember our recent sanctions? The 
enterprises easily paid the fines and continued to destroy 
nature." 
  "But the liability of the legal entity does not remove the 
blame from the individual. Unfortunately, the parties mainly to 
blame have always escaped responsibility. The guilt of the 
collective subject established by a court, the sentence of this 
court--the sentence that declares the organization's actions to 
be criminal--in the present chaos will help to single out legal 
business, even if it is with an element of risk, from criminal 
business into which entire firms are sometimes drawn." 
  Criminal liability of legal entities will certainly evoke 
disputes. Still, the basic postulate of criminal law--the 
actually liable person is responsible--does not fit completely 
into the innovation. I personally am bothered by one thing: Will 
it not turn out that the sentence for the organization will save 
the organizers from a sentence. 
<H5>  Justified Risk </H5>
  The draft Criminal Code, it seems to me, proposes a 
very important and typical market norm which will give a person 
the "right to a justified risk." 
  Article 45. Justified risk. 
  (1) It shall not be a crime to cause harm to legally 
protected interests when there is an objectively justified risk 
for achieving a socially useful goal. 
  (2) The risk shall deemed justified if the goal that has 
been 
set cannot be achieved by actions that do not involve risk and 
the individual who has taken the risk has taken the necessary 
measures to prevent harm to legally protected interests. 
  (3) Risk shall not be deemed justified if it was known to 
involve the threat of an ecological catastrophe or social 
disaster. 
  That would be a legal form for the recent 
command-administrative times! Do not count "commanders of 
production, as they were called at the time, who would take 
literally a fatal risk to do something useful for the people in 
spite of stupid prohibitions. At that time there was only one 
principle: Do the absurd, but according to Marx; push 
unmarketable products but fulfill the plan; throw seeds onto 
frozen ground but do not disobey the raykom [rayon committee]. 
Some brave souls departed from the absurd and spent the rest of 
their days in jail. Yes, much has receded into the past. 
Nonetheless enterprisingness, innovation, the achievement of a 
legitimate advantage have always involved risk. There is no 
business at all without risk. But is it right, for example, for 
the board of a joint-stock company to risk the stockholders' 
money for their own sake? Is a risky operation allowable if the 
patient has agreed to it but it is not envisioned by medical 
canons? Life is always presenting us with situations that do not 
appear in the textbooks. And our law has not tried to regulate 
them. 
<H5>  Is an Order the Law? </H5>
  What should a soldier do if he has received an order 
that is more or less clear? And what should a bookkeeper do if 
his direct superior orders him to distort the reports. And who 
will go to court if the subordinate has carried out a legal 
order? 
  Article 46. Execution of an order 
  (1) It shall not be considered a crime if harm is caused to 
legally protected interests by an individual who is acting to 
execute an order that is mandatory for him or any other 
instruction given according to the established procedure and in 
compliance with the proper form. 
  (2) Causing harm to legally protected interests as a result 
of the execution of an illegal order or other instruction shall 
not entail liability if the individual was unaware of its 
illegal character. In this case the liability for the act 
committed in execution of an illegal order or instruction shall 
be born by the individual who issued this order or instruction. 
  (3) Execution of an order or other instruction that is known 
to be illegal shall entail criminal liability but there can be 
mitigating circumstances. 
  (4) Failure to execute an illegal or criminal order or other 
instruction shall not involve criminal liability. 
  Article 8 of the Regulations of the Nuremberg Tribunal: "The 
fact that the accused was acting on instructions from the 
government or an order from his superior shall not relieve him 
or responsibility." 
  Our popular semi-proverb "the order of the superior is the 
law for the subordinate" harbors a very deep contradiction. 
  During war time the absolute nature of the order for the 
subordinate was formulated clearly in the Regulations: It was to 
be carried out without questioning whether it was criminal or 
not. Do it! All responsibility lay with the individual who gave 
the order. The draft Criminal Code proposes a different norm: It 
shall be a crime to execute a criminal order. But how is the 
subordinate to determine which order is legitimate and which is 
criminal? Can the call from the country's vice president to 
storm the city facilities be regarded as an order? What were the 
tank drivers who were given orders to open fire on the 
parliament supposed to do? 
  There is no doubt that such a norm of law places each 
follower of orders in the face of a serious problem of choice. 
How is the "switchman" supposed to recognize the legality or 
illegality of an order? 
  The legal experts with whom I was speaking answered: The 
"switchman," of course, is always the fall guy; but he does 
control switches; he is capable of diverting the train; but 
ultimately he is a "homo sapiens" and not an automaton for which 
the leaders do the thinking. 
  Obviously, in these norms the law corresponds very closely 
to 
morality and a sense of justice plays a decisive role in the 
selection of possibilities of behavior. So it would be possible 
to exclaim after the poet: "Where there is no morality, what 
good are useless laws?" But still the attempt on the part of the 
authors of the draft Criminal Code to legally regulate precisely 
these complicated, nonstandard, extraordinary situations seems 
useful. 
<H5>  Confiscation </H5>
  When you read the draft Criminal Code offered for 
discussion you get the impression that in many respects it has 
held to a position somewhere between the old and the new. I 
think this is especially clearly seen in the inclusion of 
confiscation of property as a separate punishment (Article 55). 
The people with whom I was speaking commented somewhat 
enigmatically: "That is an old question." 
  Article 55. Confiscation of property 
  (1) Confiscation of property shall be forced removal of 
property to state ownership of all or part of the property owned 
by the accused. 
  (2) Confiscation of property shall be prescribed for crimes 
that are grave, especially grave, and exceptionally grave 
committed with a selfish purpose and may be imposed only in 
cases stipulated by criminal law. 
  (3) Property needed by the accused or his dependents shall 
not be subject to confiscation... 
  Yes, perhaps it is old, like Chernomor's. In Rus for ages 
the 
property of guilty parties and falsely guilty parties "has been 
confiscated by the state," especially if there was something to 
confiscate. At the beginning of the last century Aleksandr I 
declared confiscation to be a separate punishment. Soviet rule, 
having made pillage the norm of life, soon promoted it to a norm 
of law as well. Since that time confiscation has been in all the 
codes as an independent punishment. The crime may not have been 
related in any way to the criminal enrichment--still, according 
to the sentence, everything was taken except what was needed to 
survive. 
  Yes, what has been criminally gained, if this is proven in 
court, must be taken away; there is no question about that. But 
this must be clearly documented. It is not enough to make 
mention of a crime "committed with a selfish end." It is 
necessary to indicate unequivocally what is subject to 
confiscation and when. 
  The draft Criminal Code contains much that is new, and 
a good deal has been clarified. The norms of the "General Part" 
of the draft code lay the foundations for sanctions against 
organized crime, they strengthen punishments for repeat offenses 
(cumulative punishments), they introduce life imprisonment, and 
the clarify the liability of repeat offenders. The draft takes a 
large step from the "socialist" criminal law now in force to a 
legal Criminal Code. 
  but here is the question: Will the parliament adopt the 
new Criminal Code? In 1991 the Ministry of Justice of the 
Russian Federation developed a draft Criminal Code which 
corresponded to market relations. It was not even discussed. Now 
the draft with which we have familiarized the readers has been 
submitted. But the parliament is busy patching up the old, 
socialist code. And the question arises of its own accord: Are 
they not expecting times like 1939? If so, I have the draft 
Criminal Code from that time in front of me. Perhaps it should 
be proposed to the parliament.

  [Text] Recently, during meetings with various foreign 
guests, Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma, has been fond 
of repeating approximately the same phrase: The chamber has 
already approved the framework of the 1994 budget (thereby, 
according to him, consciously supporting unpopular government 
measures) and in June it will have the second and the third 
reading. It is quite possible that the latter will really 
happen. However, the first is no more than a very strained 
approval. 
  After the Duma voted for revenue, expenditure, and budget 
deficit figures on 11 May, many commentators hastened to declare 
that the chief thing was done. It should be noted that the Duma 
itself gave reason for this, having put down, in violation of 
its own regulation, in the decree (where revenues were 
solidified in the amount of 124,477 billion rubles and 
expenditures, 194,495.31 billion rubles, the deficit totaling 
70,018.31 billion rubles) that the draft law "On the 1994 
Federal Budget" was approved at the first reading. Mikhail 
Zadornov, head of the Duma Budget Committee, confirmed the fact 
of violation of the regulation concerning the budget process to 
a correspondent of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. This violation lies in 
the fact that at the first reading the following were not 
approved: 1) distribution of revenues between the federal budget 
and budgets of components of the Russian Federation; 2) 
appropriations for sections of the federal budget in absolute 
amounts and in percent of the federal budget expenditures; 3) 
the list of defended items and upper limits of appropriations 
for them in percent of the federal budget expenditures (see 
Article 11 "Provisions Concerning the Procedure of Examination 
and Adoption by the State Duma of the Federal Draft Law 'On the 
1994 Federal Budget'" adopted on 23 March 1994). 
  Thus, there was no "first reading" (in general, this word 
combination can be used only in quotation marks). At best only 
one-half of it took place. Mr. Zadornov attributed such a 
situation to the fact that the Budget Committee was totally 
unprepared for the competent first reading on 11 May, because it 
could not receive and examine amendments and proposals by Duma 
committees concerning budget sections and items. It is obvious 
that on 11 May it was impossible to examine them just by hearing 
and, therefore, in the Duma decree all this work was postponed 
to the second reading. 
  The Committee on the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances is 
now preparing for it. It can be assumed that its members, as 
well as understanding deputies burdened or not burdened by the 
obligation to lobby for someone's benefit, with fear or, 
conversely, with hope are waiting to hear and see how the bomb 
planted by the impatient chairman of the Duma and by leaders of 
most fractions will explode ("Yabloko," "Russia's Choice," "12 
December," and IPRF [expansion not given] were against the 
submission of the budget for the "first reading" on 11 May and 
all of them, except the last, also voted). 
  The smartest advocates of an increase in military 
expenditures, who lost on 11 May, set off the fuse of this bomb. 
At the end of last week they held parliamentary hearings, at 
which it was decided to again raise the question of an increase 
in expenditures on the "national defense" section. An amount was 
also mentioned: in the bracket of 15 to 18 trillion rubles and, 
of course, its lower limit was the limit of a compromise for 
these lobbyists. However, it was stated that the budget deficit 
should remain as before. From where will money be taken? 
Apparently, part of this amount can be covered by taking 
advantage of the proposals by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the 
Committee on Economic Policy, for an increase in revenues from 
foreign economic activity, privatization, and consolidation of 
the resources of extrabudgetary funds. Deputies will hardly 
agree with the fact that, in reality, all this will give 
approximately 30 trillion rubles and, in principle, revenues can 
be increased by part of this amount. However, since the revenue 
obtained will be spent on defense, the missing part will have to 
be collected through the redistribution of money from other 
sections. 
  And then it can explode. True, at first everyone will hear 
only the bang of the detonator--at the very fateful meeting of 
the Budget Committee, where before the second reading it will 
have to decide which amendments for budget sections and, 
moreover, items of these sections (sic!) to recommend for 
adoption by the Duma and which to postpone. All fractions are 
represented in the Budget Committee, that is, it has lobbyists 
of every stripe and level. Such a meeting will not manage to 
make any sensible decision on what should be given priority. 
However, even if some lobby is poorly represented in the 
committee, it can have stronger positions during the counting of 
the total number of deputies. Thus, it is possible that the 
committee, inevitably gets into a stalemate situation. Not being 
able to decide what amendments it should submit for approval or 
rejection by the Duma, it will decide to submit all of them come 
what may. A stalemate may not happen in the committee. 
Nevertheless, in one way or another, the chamber has the last 
word. The bomb charged by the Duma's violation of its own 
regulation will explode precisely at the Duma meeting devoted to 
the budget. 
  Need one say that, according to the results of the voting in 
the chamber, the amount for individual items can exceed the 
limit on a specific section, while the total increased 
appropriations for sections in no way will amount to the 
approved limit of the budget deficit? The practice of the 
Supreme Soviet shows that this precisely happens. 
  Can it be foreseen that some lobby will meet another halfway 
and will let it have part of the appropriations? Thus, the Duma, 
most likely, will have either to expand the deficit after 
repeated votes and additions, resulting from them, of sums, or 
even before their beginning to declare the so-called "first 
reading" of 11 May a phenomenon of the type "the devil got into 
you" and to practice witchcraft, but only on paper, adjusting 
revenues to the amount of expenditures maximally suiting 
everyone. At the same time, it will have to try not to greatly 
increase the deficit in order not to anger Viktor Chernomyrdin 
very much, who from its rostrum once told the Duma with disdain: 
"You are not worth shooting." 
  In fact, how can anyone give up something to someone else 
when the budget gives little to everyone? For example, it cannot 
even be assumed that there will be a majority wishing to reduce 
the expenditures on state support for national economic sectors 
(42,364.7 billion rubles were allocated). The following are the 
biggest items in this section: the coal sector (5.9 trillion); 
the agro-industrial complex (11.9); state investments (18.2 
trillion, of which 14 go for construction, architecture, and 
urban development; 2.4, again for the agro-industrial complex; 
the rest, for debts for capital construction and into the fund 
for the revival of the merchant marine). Larger or smaller 
appropriations also go for the reproduction of the mineral and 
raw-material base (almost 2 trillion) and the protection of the 
environment, natural resources, hydrometeorology, cartography, 
and geodesy (a little more than 1 trillion). In principle, 
dealing with this section, agrarians can fight with coal 
industry workers for the norm of distribution of the fund for 
financial support for key sectors (the former receive 58 
percent, while the latter, 42 percent of this fund), but there 
can be no clear victory in this fight if it takes place. Of 
course, 14 trillion for construction and architecture is a 
tidbit, but deputies from regions will hardly permit anyone to 
take them away. In fact, it is impossible to significantly 
redistribute expenditures in this section and all those offended 
will have to convince colleague deputies that the amounts 
allocated here and there should be changed. 
  Nevertheless, lovers of distribution have a small field of 
activity in the section "foreign economic activity" (a little 
over 21 trillion rubles), where it is possible to reduce the 
amount of credits to foreign states (1.4 trillion). However, 
they have nothing more to do here, because the lion's share of 
this section (12.8 trillion) is devoted to an investment program 
(including the agro-industrial complex and the public health 
system) at the expense of foreign credits and, as practice 
shows, the connection of any money with agrarians' needs is the 
most reliable undertaking. It is difficult to imagine the Duma 
voting for a reduction in expenditures on social and cultural 
measures (12.4 trillion)--rather a reverse effect is 
possible--or on basic research and assistance for scientific and 
technical progress (only 4.2 trillion). The "national defense" 
section (37 trillion 126 billion) has already been mentioned 
above. A vote for its increase alarms the deputy's soul when the 
increase occurs at the expense of other sections. Nevertheless, 
the deputy understands that, apparently, this will have to be 
done through an increase in the deficit or machination with 
revenues. 
  The section, where only 837.2 billion rubles are allocated 
for the realization of international treaties on the 
liquidation, reduction, and limitation of arms, is too small to 
nip off something from it. Most likely, only the fate of social 
and cultural measures can befall the 12 trillion for 
law-enforcement activity and securities bodies: Everyone will 
try to increase them. Court and procuracy systems receive 1.3 
trillion rubles and also do not have chances to become the 
object of redistributors' longings. 
  It will be more complicated with sections IX and XIV: state 
administration (3.8 trillion) and financial assistance for other 
levels of authority (1.8 trillion). The fractions that voted on 
11 May against the "first reading" have already announced 
repeatedly the need to significantly reduce expenditures on 
state administration, but a response to their angry appeals has 
not been noted in the hearts of the majority of deputies. 
Although, if the majority somehow manages to connect such big 
money with something concerning the president, there is a chance 
for the Duma's intervention in these (and, especially, the 
second) sections. A total of 5.9 trillion rubles are also 
allocated for the replenishment of state orders and resources; 
1.8, for the prevention and liquidation of the consequences of 
natural calamities and extraordinary events; 6.5, for the 
support of the North. All these expenditures are more or less 
indisputable. 
  Apparently, nor is it possible to touch the liquidation and 
servicing of the state (domestic and foreign) debt (16.8 
trillion rubles). If deputies have enough strength, in 
principle, they will be able to calculate that less (7.7 
trillion) is spent on the domestic debt than on the foreign debt 
and they will be indignant. True, one can hope that deputies 
will want to probe the last section--"other state expenditures" 
in the amount of 8.9 trillion, of which only approximately 2.5 
trillion are allocated for items. 
  The possibility of adjusting revenues in order to reduce the 
deficit to a level acceptable to the government has already been 
discussed above. Despite official assurances that, in principle, 
the situation with the receipt of revenues is normal, this is 
not quite so. This is evidenced by Acting Finance Minister 
Sergey Dubinin's nod during the battles in the Budget Committee 
on 11 May in response to the statement by one of its members 
that it would be good if in 1994 revenues exceeded 60 trillion 
rubles, that is, less than one-half of what has been planned. 
This statement is based on the dynamics of collection of basic 
components of the revenue part of the budget during the first 
and the second quarter of this year. Discussing revenues, nor 
should it be forgotten that the share of the value-added tax, 
from which the fund for regional support is formed, by no means 
satisfies the potential majority of the Duma and it demands an 
increase in this share. 
  In general, going back to the degree of reality of budget 
revenue and expenditures figures written on paper, it should be 
noted that in our country in the last few years they have run 
far away, but in different directions, and could be stopped only 
through the direct nonfinancing of certain sectors.

Factories Is To Live: They Are Saying This at the Top of Their 
Voices to the Authorities Who Are Burying the Industry"] 
  [Text] The production slump in machine building over the 
last 2 years amounted to more than 50 percent. In April, more 
than 300 enterprises were operating on a reduced schedule, while 
60 were shut down completely. 
  The wages of the majority of machine builders do not exceed 
100,000 rubles, but even those are being paid on an irregular 
basis. The enterprises' social sphere is being ruined, an 
intensive exodus of skilled personnel is occurring and hidden 
unemployment is growing. 
  The enterprises' privatization has not produced any positive 
results and the unfair redistribution of collective property is 
continuing. 
  The majority of the machine-building enterprises cannot 
survive under the tax, price and financial conditions which the 
government has proposed. The Russian machine builders' trade 
unions have repeatedly proposed changing the orientation of the 
economic reforms and easing their consequences, however, the 
government is not adopting or is adopting very belatedly actual 
measures based on our proposals. 
  Under these conditions, at the decision of their elective 
organs, the Russian Federation Machine Builders Trade Union, the 
Motor Vehicle and Agricultural Machine Building Workers Trade 
Union, the Machine Builders and Instrument Makers Trade Union 
and the All-Russian Elektroprofsoyuz [electrical machine 
builders trade union] intend to organize on 1-3 June collective 
protest actions against the policy of the organs of power and 
administration, which is aimed at ruining machine building and 
making the lives of the sector's workers worse, including the 
picketing of the Russian Federation Government House on 2 June 
by representatives of the machine-building enterprises' labor 
collectives. 
<H5>  The Demands of the Russian Machine Builders' Trade Unions </H5>
  1. Support should be given to domestic machine building, 
including on the basis of the implementation of the approved 
special-purpose federal programs. 
  2. Urgent specific actions to overcome the mutual payments 
crisis should be carried out. 
  3. The state's portions should be returned completely to the 
agricultural producers, the defense departments and the MPS 
[Ministry of Railways] -- the users of machine-building products. 
  4. The priority of payments for wages over other payments 
should be established. 
  5. The government should ensure the fulfillment of 
obligations based on the Agreement on Social Harmony and on the 
General and Sectorial Tariff Agreements. 
  6. The number and amount of taxes should be reduced, the 
procedure for their collection should be simplified and the tax 
system should provide incentives for commodity producers. 
  7. Effective state regulation of prices for energy 
resources, 
transportation services, communications, individual types of 
products, medicines and other services in the interests of the 
basic mass of the population should be implemented. 
  8. An effective public employment system should be 
established as quickly as possible. 
  9. The safety of Russia's citizens should be ensured.

<F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Solovyev, deputy chairman of the FNPR </F>
Commission for the Socio-Economic Development of the North, and 
Albert Kozlov: "Wheat Does Not Grow in Evenkia: The Inhabitants 
of the North Cannot Get the Goods Necessary for Life in This 
Navigation Period"] 
  [Text] For Russia, the North is two-thirds of the territory 
of the country, in which one-tenth of the population lives. The 
North means oil, coal, diamonds, gold, furs, timber and huge 
reserves of other raw material resources. 
  But here is the paradox. The government wants to obtain 
increasingly more from the northerners, but shows increasingly 
less concern for them. In order for the people to live and work 
normally in the bleak, remote regions, almost everything has to 
be delivered there: grain, vegetables, matches, soap, clothing, 
medicines, production equipment.... 
  It was always that way. The system of supply for the 
northerners has been in effect in the country for decades. First 
they accumulated cargo at specific river and sea ports, and as 
soon as spring came to those regions, ships loaded with 
everything needed hurried to these god-forsaken corners, hard to 
reach even by plane. All the same, in the short navigation 
period, the seamen and river workers delivered to the 
northerners almost everything that they needed for life in the 
long winter and Arctic night. 
  The system that had been set up has been breaking down in 
the 
last few years. Take last winter. Even the government was forced 
to evaluate the supply situation for the North as catastrophic. 
As early as December, for example, the collective of the Tokhomo 
geological prospecting enterprise, which is in the Evenkia 
settlement of Baykhit, had no products, medicines, goods for 
production purposes, and this means wages as well. In the 1993 
navigation period, less than half of what was proposed was 
delivered there. It is a wonder that the people survived last 
winter. It was the same over the entire expanse of the Russian 
"norths" -- from the Kola Peninsula to Chukotka and the Kuril 
Islands.... 
  Just a few days remain until the opening of this navigation 
season on the northern rivers. What kind of situation faces it? 
It can't get any worse....

  As can be seen, government bodies drew no conclusions from 
the extremely grave situation of last year. One can see that 
they are not hastening to do so. In confirmation of this, we 
will present one more table.

  The problem of survival was mentioned with alarm at the 
recent 4th Conference of Trade Unions of Northern Territories. 
Quite a few bitter words were spoken about the financial-credit 
mechanism for cargo delivery. The trade union estimate of this 
situation was also supported by the Federation Council. The 
deputies, expressing their concern about the situation in the 
regions, passed the appropriate resolution. Deputy hearings on 
these problems began in the State Duma. 
  Only in the government structures are they continuing to 
discuss the subject of a comprehensive solution to the northern 
problem. The matter goes no farther than talks, though. The most 
dangerous thing is that the necessary volume of financing is not 
fully coordinated with the State budget. 
  Considering all this, as well as the economic problems 
becoming more exacerbated in the regions, the FNPR 
[FITUR--Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia] has 
repeatedly appealed to the RF President with a proposal to hold 
a meeting under his leadership with the participationg of all 
those involved in the important national economic problem. There 
is no time left for further shelving of this problem.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Novikov, under the rubric "Analysis": </F>
"Borders Are Open--So Far, Only for Mafia"] 
  [Text] "A few years ago Moscow was advertised as a 
city of intellectual and cultural blossoming, compared to Paris 
of the 1920's and New York of the 1940's. Today it frequently 
seems that Moscow more resembles the Chicago of Al Capone's 
times... Moscow has turned into a menacing 
city."--THE WASHINGTON POST 
  At a time when the president of Russia, like the beloved 
leader Kim Chong-il, "provides a hands-on leadership" for 
Russian intelligence, counterintelligence, and border guards, 
conducting meetings with them and mapping the milestones for 
future victories, it looks like our American comrades are 
increasingly losing faith in the ability of our "competent 
organs" to at least get somewhat of a handle on the criminal 
situation on one-seventh of the dry land. 
  It has always been believed, and justly so, that the regular 
American Joe does not give a damn about anything that has no 
direct bearing on him personally and his country. Therefore, it 
is symbolic that recently articles on the subject of runaway 
crime in Russia appear weekly in American newspapers. It means 
that this problem, which has already drove us to frustration by 
its "urgency," is already perceived there as something almost 
close to home. And judging by headlines, is even treated with a 
shade of panic. 
  "...American politicians are discovering that they will have 
to battle a threat to national security that is perhaps much 
more serious than the ill-fated Ames' espionage case," writes 
Martin Anderson in THE WASHINGTON TIMES, and goes on to warn: "A 
situation where the authority in the second world nuclear power 
of significance may end up in the hands of criminal and 
nationalist fanatics no longer appears inconceivable." He is 
echoed by an equally perplexed Steven Erlanger in THE NEW YORK 
TIMES: "Few could foresee that crime will be so large-scale and 
so well organized, so strongly linked with the weak government, 
and that it will create the real prospect of the emergence of a 
superpower run by criminals, a sort of Sicily stretching over 
two continents." 
  Perhaps these are just journalistic "embellishments" for 
better effect? Far from so. A serious "word" in this respect has 
already come from the most competent people in Washington (and 
not only there). Appearing in April in the U.S. Senate, CIA 
Director James Woolsey spoke of the threat of a "criminal 
politburo" emerging in Russia, which will become a "strong and 
ingenious adversary," while a high-ranking London police 
official David Winess warned directly that "unless Russian 
organized crime groups are treated with all due vigilance, you 
are not going to be able to cope with this problem--so fast it 
exacerbates and such is its scale." 
  As for Americans, they certainly keep up their vigilance. It 
is not accidental that a few days ago there was a report that 
the FBI intends to open its representation (or whatever it may 
be called) in Moscow in the nearest future, although in the past 
they have rejected this idea "because of budget paucity," and 
the CIA had been against it as well. 
<H5>  * * * </H5>
  Articles filed by foreign correspondents accredited in 
Moscow 
resemble reports from a country at war: the number of 
casualties, grisly details of crimes, nearly daily bombings, 
"the atmosphere of rage and cruelty in which it seems 
aggressiveness has become a norm"--in short, everything that for 
Russia means "rampant gangsterism here." And actually, Western 
colleagues hardly exaggerate. 
  On 20 April, some touches to this gloomy picture were added 
by CIA Director James Woolsey, who spoke at the hearings in the 
U.S. Senate on the subject of international organized crime. 
Speaking of the largest in the world criminal groups, Woolsey 
separately identified four: Latin American drug syndicates, the 
Italian Mafia, Chinese "triads," and organized criminal groups 
in the former USSR. He said that there are approximately 5,700 
criminal gangs currently operating on the territory of Russia, 
and another 1,000 similar formations on the territory of the 
former Soviet republics. "Approximately 200 of them," said the 
CIA director, "are large, far-flung criminal organizations, 
which are involved in criminal activities across the entire 
former Soviet Union and 29 other countries." 
  In the opinion of the chief American chekist, the Russian 
mafia is currently at the stage of formalizing its 
organizational structure. So far there is no single center 
directing the entire criminal infrastructure, but it may appear 
in the form of the aforementioned "criminal politburo." At least 
underground "obkoms" [oblast committees] and "gorkoms" [city 
committees] are already functioning. 
  James Woolsey states authoritatively (and we have no reason 
not to believe him) that "to a considerable extent the might of 
Russian organized crime is the result of its ties with corrupt 
government officials. Right now organized crime probably does 
not control the Russian Government, but it has tremendous 
influence in some of its segments." "Without any doubt, there 
are links between the leaders of the main criminal groups and 
some prominent political figures," said the CIA director. 
"Keeping in mind the number of companies that are under the 
influence or control of organized crime, it would be difficult 
for government bureaucrats in Russia, even high-ranking 
government officials, to avoid close contact with it." According 
to Woolsey, criminal groups in Russia spend between 30 and 50 
percent of their profits on bribing "government employees with 
good connections, first and foremost in customs and in the 
militia." 
  One can only regret that James Woolsey did not provide at 
least a partial list of these "figures"--as part of humanitarian 
aid, so to say. By doing this he could save the West billions of 
dollars, which arrive in Russia with fanfare in the form of 
credits, and then quietly flow into foreign banks. 
<H5>  * * * </H5>
  So how can our tattooed compatriots present a threat to 
world 
civilization? 
  First, in the opinion of the West, the rampant crime in 
Russia is a direct threat to its internal stability. The same 
James Woolsey quite logically believes that because of 
activation of organized criminal formations "a considerable 
number of people in Russia lose faith in their government's 
ability to function, which revives their nostalgia for a 'strong 
hand' that will bring order back to the streets." "There is a 
real danger that a rapid growth of crime will turn people away 
from Yeltsin's program of reforms and throw them into the 
embrace of political forces, of supporters of a hard line," he 
says. 
  In other words, the West is very much afraid that the 
Russians, driven up against the wall by gangsters, will demand 
the "iron fist" for a curtain call and then they, the West, will 
have to deal not with the compliant Boris Nikolayevich but with 
the unpredictable Vladimir Volfovich. The results of 
parliamentary elections in Russia showed that these concerns are 
not groundless and it is not accidental that Zhirinovskiy has 
made fight against crime one of the central points of his 
program. And presidential elections are still ahead for us.... 
  The second point that causes great concern in the West is 
that organized crime in Russia threatens to weaken its control 
over the stockpile of tactical nuclear warheads and nuclear 
materials in general. "There is serious evidence," writes the 
American magazine ATLANTIC MONTHLY, "that organized crime in the 
former Soviet Union is constantly trying to find access to the 
nuclear stockpile for the purpose of deriving giant profits." 
And the former U.S. State Department official Paul Goble 
maintains: "I am convinced that if I had $25 million, I could 
buy a warhead and the codes for launching it." 
  TIME magazine reports that many traders in Moscow offer for 
sale small quantities of radioactive substances, which, however, 
are not suitable for making a nuclear bomb. "But nobody has any 
doubt that a market of real nuclear materials does exist." The 
proof of this is last year's incident when an employee of a 
Moscow nuclear materials research center fled, taking with him 
one and a half kilograms of highly enriched uranium. True, the 
stolen material was soon recovered, but perhaps we simply do not 
know of other such cases with a less happy ending? 
  And finally, the entire world community watches in horror 
cooperation processes within the framework of international 
organized crime. Unlike proletarians of all countries who never 
did get around to uniting, the gangsters implement the famous 
Marxist slogan quite successfully. 
  According to CIA data, Italian and Russian mafiosi have 
already held two "symposiums"--in Prague and in Warsaw. In 
keeping with the agreements reached there, the Italians share 
their "expertise" in the area of acquisition and distribution of 
drugs, while the Russians ensure safe routes for their 
transportation and make a distribution network available. "Our" 
gangsters have already begun cooperation with the Colombian drug 
barons from the Cali cartel as well. As is known, the trail from 
a huge consignment (one tonne) of cocaine confiscated by Russian 
customs led to Colombia. In addition, the CIA maintains that the 
Russian mafia moves drugs from Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and 
the Central Asian countries to Europe and North 
America--naturally, through the territory of Russia. 
  As for foreign gangsters, they see our country as an 
excellent place for money laundering. According to Luciano 
Violante, who heads the Italian parliament's commission on 
combating the mafia, just recently Calabrian mafiosi invested 2 
trillion lira in a small bank and an oil refinery in the 
outskirts of St. Petersburg. Which brings to mind an old 
journalistic joke: "Sodom and Gomorrah are sister cities!" 
<H5>  * * * </H5>
  In the past, our newspapers regularly published the rubric 
"Soviet Man Abroad." It usually featured tales of various heroic 
deeds by our compatriots: one rescued a foreign old lady from a 
fire; another resolutely rebuffed the intrigues of foreign 
intelligence; still others responded to a desperate SOS by 
Japanese fishermen. Such things did happen, of course, but 
mainly all of us remember what a sad sight a Soviet man actually 
presented abroad on an official trip or as a tourist: the 
intimidated penniless creature, afraid of every shadow, seeing 
CIA agents in every trash can, and therefore preferring to move 
around exclusively in groups--like baboons. 
  There have been blessed changes in this respect, too: Former 
comrades with foreign travel privileges have turned into 
citizens without travel privileges, while corpulent herds of 
those who in the past most often had a lot of practice 
addressing others as "Comrade Warden" currently have found their 
grazing pastures at Champs-Elysee. 
  The monstrous magnitude of the illegal "flight" of capital 
from Russia has already been written about many times, but it 
may still be worth reminding that at the time when our 
leadership kneels before the West and begs with an outstretched 
hand for a couple of billion, about $40 billion have flown 
abroad from Russia since 1992, and about $1 billion now flows 
there every month. 
  According to the British company Control Risks Group, which 
consults Western businessmen on matters of security, most of the 
almost 2,000 commercial banks currently existing in Russia are 
used to launder money and transfer it abroad. Now another method 
of exporting money abroad has become fashionable: Ingenious 
crooks buy tickets by the hundreds for the Air Canada airline, 
take them to Canada by suitcase and once there, return them for 
hard currency as "unused." And in April, the work of 
Sheremetyevo customs was paralyzed for an hour: Its staff was 
counting the million dollars one of the passengers was taking 
with him to London. 
  Therefore, as the reader may guess, our "Japs" 
["Yaponchik"--nickname of a Russian mafia "kingpin" who lives in 
the U.S.] are not destitute in the far abroad. According to a 
specialist from the same Control Risks Group, "in London a 
considerable number of luxury items are being purchased by 
Russians with suitcases of cash at the price of up to $3 million 
per item. By comparison, what is a check in an expensive 
restaurant--1,000 pounds "per nose?" With satisfaction, the 
owner of one such establishment told a SPIEGEL [as published] 
correspondent: "They spend much more than Arabs." 
  London bankers have calculated that the Russians already 
have 
deposited in British banks at high interest yield more than 3 
billion pounds. They buy up homes and land lots in such 
aristocratic areas as Chelsey, Mayfair, and Kensington, have 
formed a waiting list for prestigious Jaguars, and have placed 
their children in the most expensive colleges and boarding 
schools. "They always demand the best and most expensive," says 
a London real estate agent. "You can recognize these gentlemen 
first and foremost by diamonds," says the manager of a Tiffany 
jewelry firm. He is upset, though, that Russian visitors 
themselves wear "poor quality jewelry, while buying from us 
expensive stones the size of a pigeon egg." Well, this is just 
too bad--they do not teach good taste in the zone... 
<H5>  * * * </H5>
  Right now--against the background of our endless references 
to the "civilized world" and the splendor reigning there--one 
may get a false impression that corruption, gangsterism, and 
street crime are problems of a purely Russian "vintage," unknown 
to Americans, Italians, or British. It is silly to argue that 
this is not so. As is known, only two things provide more or 
less secure protection from crime: either a dictatorial regime 
with its "iron fist," as it was under Stalin or Hitler, or a 
highly stable and socially-oriented economy, such as exists, for 
instance, in Sweden. 
  As for most industrially developed countries in the West, 
which we tirelessly point to as an example for ourselves, I dare 
to assure you that their citizens--much as ours--bemoan day and 
night the rise of all varieties of crime. Italy has long become 
famous for its Mafia, corruption, and political terrorism. In 
far-from-bloodthirsty England, where capital punishment was 
repealed 30 years ago, now 75 percent of the population demand 
it be restored. The United States of America spends $90 billion 
annually fighting crime, and nevertheless the national loss 
resulting from it--with the same enviable regularity--amounts to 
more than $400 billion. 
  And the statistics in this area do not depend at all on the 
country's operational socioeconomic model. In China, despite the 
preservation of political dogmatism, the development of market 
relations also produced a tremendous number of new stimuli for 
theft and corruption. In the beginning of this year XINHUA 
reported that more than 300,000 bribe-taking bureaucrats were 
"netted" in China's Anhui province alone. 
  Nevertheless, although we cannot claim a strictly Russian 
monopoly of crime, the situation in our country fundamentally 
differs from that in the rest of the world. While the situation 
there is difficult, in our country it is atrocious. We have 
neither Chinese nor Arab cruelty, nor American money, nor--least 
of all--Scandinavian stability and wealth. What we have is a 
complete mess, demoralization, and anarchy, where gangsters and 
bribe-takers multiply like bacteria in a Petri dish. While "over 
there" a line still exists between honest people and criminals, 
"here" it is already so washed out that soon we will be 
completely unable to distinguish one from the other. 
  Criminality has permeated the masses so much that the 
expression "a criminal state" no longer appears to be a 
journalistic exaggeration. And the saddest part is that the 
"masses" are not really that much at fault. Pseudo-reforms have 
pushed them into a corner, and the only way out often is unclean 
conscience. 
  I recently happened upon an article by an American author, 
who naively berated his country for not aiding former Soviet 
republics more in the fight against crime. This is laughable for 
at least two reasons. First, the Russian leadership got the 
Americans used to the idea that the latter, like the Communists 
in our past, "are responsible for everything," from winter crops 
to suppression of crooks. Second, equally laughable per se is 
the assumption that crime in the CIS or just Russia can be 
defeated by monetary infusions into the decrepit organism of law 
enforcement organs--they will end up precisely in the place 
where infusions usually end up.... Criminal rampage in the 
Russian expanses is the result not only and not so much of the 
weakness of our militia and special services. This is precisely 
the case where the problem cannot be solved without dealing with 
the economic base. Had we not had "shock therapy," we would not 
have crime epidemics. Because it is widely known that under 
normal circumstances it is still much more profitable and 
comfortable to be an honest man than a bribe-taker and gangster.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dmytro Vasylovych Pavlychko, a Ukrainian </F>
poet and politician, by Petro Ovchar: "No More Docility"] 
  [Text] "Pavlychko didn't lose the election, Ukraine 
did!" ..."We are spiritually impoverished by Pavlychko's absence 
from the parliament" ..."Someone finds it convenient to bring 
Ukraine to her knees before Russia with a parliament packed with 
Marchenkos, Morozes and their like. Its a tragedy that Pavlychko 
is not among the deputies that defend Ukrainian independence...." 
  I heard many similar comments on April 22 by the parliament 
building, and decided to meet with Dmytro Vasylovych Pavlychko, 
a well-known Ukrainian poet and politician, for a frank 
interview and discussion. 
  [Ovchar] Why didn't you run for parliament in the Western 
oblast where a victory was a sure thing, but instead in Chyhyryn? 
  [Pavlychko] It was not my intention to win for the sake of 
winning. I knew that in Eastern Ukraine it would be difficult to 
win, but I felt that from a moral point of view it would be more 
honest to lose in the East than be elected in the West. Of 
course I wanted to be in the new parliament and had every right 
to be. Ukraine has made significant progress in international 
politics and it was in this area that I had the most experience. 
Nevertheless, elections are an important aspect in developing a 
new consciousness in our nation, and I decided to run in a 
region where national consciousness had been most severely 
oppressed for hundreds of years. The Chyhyryn region is the 
nucleus of our statehood, a fact well understood by our enemies. 
For that reason even the mildest display of national pride 
evoked much more severe repressions than in Galicia. I am 
referring to the savage executions carried out by the Cheka and 
NKVD after the fall of the Kholodnyy Yar republic. On March 9 of 
this year we commemorated Shevchenko at my initiative, the first 
such celebration after many decades. Someone had to go to 
Chyhyryn, if only to renew the tradition of celebrating 
Shevchenko. 
  Having gone to Chyhyryn I also avoided running against 
people 
with similar beliefs from Rukh and other democratic parties. 
This was quite important to me, since I cannot conceive of 
anything more degrading than a squabble among friends and mutual 
recriminations. This move avoided confrontation with some of the 
more hard-headed `fighters for Ukraine'. It made it possible for 
me to take up a fight for a new way of thinking, for a new way 
of perceiving Ukrainian history and Ukraine's current situation, 
and for a new world outlook. This is a struggle that will take a 
lot of time. 
  True, I lost, but I got a sixth of the votes. The people who 
supported me are the strongest proponents of reforms, democracy 
and statehood for Ukraine in the Chyhyryn and Kamyanskyy rayons 
in the Cherkasy Oblast. 
  Think how much support we--democrats--would have in Eastern 
Ukraine if we did not spend all our time in the cities and 
villages of Galicia but went to the Dnieper region, Donbas, and 
Southern Ukraine. Even if we failed to wins seats in the 
parliament we would raise the consciousness of hundreds of 
thousands or even millions of our countrymen! 
  [Ovchar] Recently the press reported that deputy Serhiy 
Holovatyy hinted that those who found National Rukh have lost 
their ideals, sold their souls to satan, and now seek cushy 
government jobs. Referring to you he said "...the Draches and 
Pavlychkos turned power over to the communists and then joined 
their camp." Comments? 
  [Pavlychko] Four years ago I was one of Holovatyy's trusted 
colleagues when the parliament was being formed. I liked that 
young lawyer very much and it pains me to talk about him now. He 
acts like a narcissistic, conceited child. His baseless and 
vulgar attacks on the Ukrainian president are a reflection of 
his crudeness, and he has accused me, Drach and other deputies 
of collaborating with satan. This was in connection with the 
establishment of the Kievan patriarchate, a great achievement in 
our history. At least we have one independent Christian church. 
The fact that he is attempting to undermine this very 
institution suggest that something more is involved, but it is 
beneath my dignity to devote any more time to him and his base 
behavior. 
  [Ovchar] Still, why did you select Chyhyryn and not, for 
example, an electoral district in the Kherson region? 
  [Pavlychko] The first poem I learned by heart was 
Shevchenko's The Desecrated Grave (Rozryta Mohyla). Shevchenko's 
Chyhyryn and Subotiv lie at the heart of my being. I had a 
teacher from Chyhyryn, Anastasiya Leontiyivna Korsunivska. When 
battles were being fought in Kosmach between the UPA [Ukranian 
Insurgent Army] and NKVD [People's Commissariat of Internal 
Affairs] batallions, and in Yabloniv you could hear the 
explosion of grenades and other munitions, she was teaching us 
history in the eight grade. She taught us names of the cossack 
hetmans, colonels and haydamaks with the full knowledge that at 
that very instance the followers of Bandera were dying for our 
freedom while serving in units named in honor of the 
Doroshenkos, Hamaliyas, Charnots, Zaliznyaks. In the summer of 
1952, after graduating from the university, I lived for several 
weeks in Borovytsya with my friend O. Shchyrytsya. My stay in 
that village--the home of otaman Pavlyuk--has been etched into 
my memory forever. I covered the Chyhyryn region on foot and 
still have friends in the villages dating back from that time. 
Then and later I visited Subotiv, Medvedivka, Stetsivka and 
other villages in that sacred land. I chose Chyhyryn because I 
feel close to it and know it quite well. Because I love this old 
cossack capital I founded the "Fund for the Restoration of 
Hetman B. Khmelnytskyy's Residence in Chyhyryn" long before I 
even thought of running for a deputy. 
  [Ovchar] What will happen to this fund now? 
  [Pavlychko] I will continue to serve as president of this 
benevolent organization. The fund has its articles of 
organization and a bank account at the Ukrinbank in Kiev. I will 
do what I can to see to it that it continues to grow. Chyhyryn 
and the worldwide Ukrainian community will celebrate the 400th 
anniversary of birthday of Hetman Khmelnytskyy in December, 
1995. B. Khmelnytskyy was the founder of the Ukrainian state in 
cossack times. Without his accomplishment it would be hard to 
imagine a drive to independence and a sense of national dignity 
in our people. His oath to the tsar was as much a diplomatic 
maneuver as was his oath to the Polish crown before the final 
liberation of Ukraine from Polish nobility. Much too late I. 
Mazepa attempted to carry out Khmelnytskyy's plans. As a symbol 
of Ukrainian independence Chyhyryn will attract more and more 
people, and I see a great and happy future for it. But for now 
it is a destitute and unhappy city. The nuclear power station 
remains unfinished and thousands are unemployed. What can be 
done to save the qualified workers capable of providing Ukraine 
with the energy it needs but who don't have the opportunity to 
exercise their skills and expertise? I have gotten in touch with 
Western investors about the frozen Chyhyryn nuclear power plant 
and will continue with these efforts. 
  [Ovchar] What was the main reason for your defeat? 
  [Pavlychko] The primary voter here is a villager, a 
collective farm worker. I met with them, but not in mass 
meetings or clubs, but largely with working brigades. In other 
words, with small numbers. The major political force here is the 
head of a collective farm. These types agitated against me for 
their candidate, I. Vasyura, the head of the Khoduliyiv 
Collective Farm. They are the feudal lords whom the farm workers 
fear to offend because they are completely dependent on them 
economically. It is a hard life. The majority of the farm 
workers are older people and retirees and they fear the collapse 
of the collective farms. Who is going to take care of them then? 
Who is going to supple them with the necessities of life? A 
private farmer? They don't trust him. And they're right! 
  I think a different approach to farm reforms would be more 
suitable than the one advocated by the parliament. I had to make 
peace between collective farm workers and private farmers in 
Lubyanky in the Ternopil region. Transferring large measures of 
land to private hands will mean social conflict in the village. 
Everyone in a collective farm realizes that they will not get as 
much land in the future as is now being granted because there 
simply won't be enough land. The collective farm worker will 
regard the private farmer as an enemy until all the land is 
privatized and the amount of land in one's possession is 
determined by market forces and individual abilities. 
  But my realistic--in fact, pro-collective farm--program was 
not heard, and I was presented as an enemy of the collective 
farm. All those who were bad off in the collective farms and 
whose condition had deteriorated even more voted against me. In 
addition, all those philistines for whom the collective farm is 
now a paradise because there is no higher authority to order 
them around or punish them also voted against me to preserve 
their status quo. 
  [Ovchar] You said the villages are made up of old people. 
But 
aren't younger people returning because life there is now easier 
than in the cities? 
  [Pavlychko] Very few are coming back, and the villages are 
dying out. In Stetsivka fifty people died and two were born in 
1994. If the young people who left the villages don't come back 
our chornozem will soon be covered with weeds. Consequently, 
farm reforms are an absolute must to save our people since the 
collective village is dying out. The Moscow-type of `developed' 
socialism created such disparities between the village and the 
city that we now have no choice but favor villages over cities 
to attract young people there to enjoy a more comfortable 
lifestyle that is closer to nature. This will require new laws 
and reorientation of national goals. 
  [Ovchar] How do you feel about the elections in general and 
what do you think the new parliament will be like? 
  [Pavlychko] I have no tragic prognoses. The elections were 
held in the midst of nostalgia for times when bread was cheap 
and human dignity had no value. The state took care of its 
slaves and provided food while trampling on human, national and 
civil rights. These elections, particularly in Eastern Ukraine, 
are reminiscent of the rebellion that Moses encountered while 
leading the Israelites out of Egypt to the Promised Land of 
Canaan. This too will pass and there is no going back. The 
majority of the new deputies are not party members and are not 
disposed to turn Ukraine back into a colony of an imperial 
system headed by Zhirinovskiy or Zyuganov. 
  I have confidence in the new deputies and hope that 
political 
ambitions and differences between the parties will be set aside 
so that we can proceed with economic reforms. We need a new 
government that will increase our exports and income, reverse 
the outflow of dollars earned by our people, balance the budget 
and introduce the hryvnya. 
  I am against presidential elections since they are 
unconstitutional. Kravchuk agreed to limit his term to four 
years rather than five, which means that presidential elections 
can be held in December of next year. Until we decide who is to 
hold executive power--the president or the prime minister--and 
until the parliament is at full strength and all the local 
elections and other problems that have troubled us are settled, 
a presidential election would lead to economic instability and 
discord. 
  [Ovchar] I would be remiss if I did not inquire about any 
new 
literary endeavours in your life? 
  [Pavlychko] Chyhyryn means a lot to me and in my free time I 
have written a cycle of poems entitled "Chyhyryn" which I would 
like to offer to the readers of LITERATURNA UKRAYINA. (The poems 
are published below--Eds.) 
  [Ovchar] Do you have any comments on the article by Yu. 
Badzo 
"Let's Not Commit Suicide for Nothing," recently published in 
LITERATURNA UKRAYINA? 
  [Pavlychko] That was a new democratic manifesto not limited 
to the democratically oriented parties. We have no `government 
party' and Ukrainian communists are not a new creation. However, 
many of the old members of the CPU were secretly for 
independence. The democratic forces must cooperate with the 
individuals who have no party affiliation, i.e, the mythical 
`government party', since our main objective is the preservation 
of our statehood. Only an independent Ukraine can guarantee 
social justice, and independence requires consolidation of all 
of our citizens. 
  [Ovchar] What will you do now that you are 'free'? 
  [Pavlychko] Be involved in literature and politics, same as 
before. You can work at statehood without being a deputy. As a 
member of the Democratic Party of Ukraine I will strive to unite 
the various small democratic parties into a single, solid 
political organization, otherwise we will fall prey to 
individual ambitions and lose our statehood, as has happened 
before in our history. 
  [Ovchar] What do you mean by a single political 
organization? 
  [Pavlychko] A political party. At the Khust conference I had 
advocated transforming Rukh into a political party. My proposal 
was not supported and Rukh fell apart into a number of parties. 
There were other reasons for that too--leaders that could not 
find common ground. The tragedy lies in the fact that our 
divisions were not along political lines but as followers of 
different leaders. I think the time has come for these leaders 
to step down since their activities are placing our national 
independence at risk. We could then unite the democratic 
organizations with Rukh into a powerful political entity that 
could promote Ukrainian statehood. The present leaders must be 
made to realize that their time is up. 
  [Ovchar] The elections also revealed flaws in the election 
laws because of all the irregularities. What are your views on 
this? 
  [Pavlychko] To put it gently, the election law is not very 
democratic. Anyone can run as long as he and his wife and 
children can get 300 signatures on a petition. In addition, a 
candidate that lost in one district cannot run in another even 
if drafted. Another major mistake is that elections were not 
carried out as they were in Russia, where half of the deputies 
were elected from political parties according to a proportional 
system. In that case individual candidates are elected as well 
as representatives of certain political viewpoints. However, our 
parliament passed a law to preserve itself at any cost. We had 
to vote for 450 deputies although we don't need such a large 
number of parliamentarians, and do so under a majority system. 
  [Ovchar] Thank you for the interview and the discussion and, 
despite all the setbacks and problems, I wish you much success 
in your future literary and political activities.

  [Text] Myroslav Volodymyrovych, in analyzing the results of 
the recent elections to the Supreme Soviet, some say: how 
wonderful that our people have demonstrated their political 
awareness by expressing their will in such large numbers. 
Others, on the other hand, say: how terrible that our people 
elected Lord knows whom. Which view do you support? 
  [Popovych] This is one and the same phenomenon. The fact 
that 
people took such an active part in the elections and the fact 
that they sometimes did not vote for the people they should have 
voted for -- these are two sides of the same coin. This means 
that the public is uneasy, in an aggressive mood, and does not 
know what to do... The political culture of the general masses 
is exactly what one would expect it to be in a region where 
people have lived only a few years in a parliamentary republic. 
e live in a free country -- you can't deny that. However, under 
normal circumstances, people are somewhat less politically 
active than what we are seeing here. In the West, towards which 
we constantly look, a 50-60 percent turnout is considered 
wonderful, because it is natural for people to be more involved 
in other things than politics. Obviously, the turnout has to be 
large enough to ensure that the elections are valid. But if 
everyone runs to the polls in a parliamentary republic, this is 
a sign of an unhealthy situation. It means that the society is 
ill, that it is running a fever. It means that the political 
structure is ailing. This explains the high turnout at the polls 
as well as what I would call such a radical voting pattern. 
Moreover, there were people among those who were first to cross 
the finish line in the election marathon who had no constructive 
program in their heart of hearts. Strictly speaking, neither the 
radical-communists, nor the radical-nationalists had any 
intention of presenting any plans for overcoming the economic 
crisis. All they wanted was a tribune from which to be heard. 
Why -- to destabilize the situation? To assume power? 
  A weak political center is a symptom of the same disease. 
  [Oliynyk] Incidentally, how do you explain the defeat of the 
centrist political forces in the elections to the Supreme 
Council? From time to time, one party or another announced its 
intention to take a position in the center. One had the 
impression that there was no more room there, and yet... 
  [Popovych] One reason for this is the objective cirumstance 
that centrist ideas are unpopular in the conditions in which we 
live today. But if we were to conduct a comprehensive 
sociological survey to determine what it is that people really 
want... In fact, we did just that, and we took into account the 
results of such studies when working out the program of the 
Democratic Center [Demtsentr], an alliance of centrist 
politicians formed shortly before the parliamentary elections. I 
was one of the authors of this program. The surveys show that 
the people really want centrist methods of solving the different 
problems. Methods that only the centrist parties can offer these 
days. But these centrists parties were left, as the Russians 
say, "unclaimed." Largely because the majority of our country's 
intelligentsia has remained outside all political parties. And 
the parties that do exist are losing members. It is, after all, 
difficult to carry on an enormous amount of preelection work, 
virtually for nothing and in one's own valuable free time. What 
is more, the intelligentsia takes an ironic view of political 
parties, a suspicious view, which, in my opinion, is a grave sin 
on its part. The fact that ordinary people, so to speak, also 
look at parties askance, is a consequence of the former. 
Meanwhile, our intelligentsia, particularly our technical 
intelligentsia, has enormous potential! Heads of gold and hands 
of gold!. 
  That is why the political center proved to have absolutely 
no 
rganizational backing in the elections. 
  In addition, there exists a uniquely Ukrainian 
interpretation 
of the term "center." For some reason, when we say "center," we 
mean some sort of outer edge [kray], as in the proverb: "my 
house stands at the edge [of the village], I know nothing" 
[i.e., I am neutral in this matter]. And so this center is 
forming on this very principle. The center is perceived as that 
political group that is expected to "quell" all the convulsions 
coming from the flanks. In reality, the center is where optimal 
decisions are made. This is a first-aid station, a 
social-therapy station. It has a well-defined political 
countenance! 
  In general, our society is like a rider at a crossroads torn 
in three different directions trying to find a solution to its 
problems. The first direction points to the national solution. 
We are standing on the threshhold -- although we have not yet 
crossed it -- of a situation in which our national orientators 
could turn into a policy oriented towards Ukrainian ethnic 
origins, a policy of restricting the human rights of those not 
of Ukrainian descent. As yet, we have no Zhirinovsky-style 
nationalism in our country, and thank God for that. The few 
newly elected people's deputies to the Supreme Council who can 
be described as extreme nationalists have so far not proclaimed 
such a policy publicly, although we know that such sentiments 
exist. Nevertheless, all our social, economic, and political 
problems are viewed by certain political forces through the 
prism of national concerns. For instance, it was enough for 
Leonid Kuchma to enter into the political arena -- let me stress 
that I do not wish to discuss Mr. Kuchma at this time and that I 
am merely stating a fact -- it was enough for him to enter into 
the political arena and announce that he did not want to 
exacerbate Ukraine's relations with Russia for the 
national-democratic forces to write him off. They have even 
proclaimed his Interregional Reform Bloc [MBR] to be the number 
one enemy. This kind of unhealthy reaction is a sign of 
political obtuseness and one-sidedness. In fact, the public mood 
is the same in eastern and western Ukraine; the only difference 
is that these moods form in different ways. 
  The second direction consists of solving socioeconomic 
problems. In other words, the sausage direction. I do not use 
this as a derisive expression --there is nothing comical about 
people wanting sausage, which even academicians cannot always 
afford these days. Obviously, many of the ontradictions in our 
society come to a head on this "sausage" level. But even in this 
sphere things are not as simple as they may appear. For example 
-- a journalist friend of mine told me this story -- there is a 
businessman in Kharkiv who every day fed a hundred impoverished 
old people at a restaurant. He ran as a candidate to the Supreme 
Council. Following the first round of the elections, the 
businessman asked the people he had been taking care of: who did 
you vote for? "What do you mean, who?" -- they asked. "For the 
communists, of course!" In other words, they depended on him to 
feed them, but voted for the communists. It probably all boils 
down to the genetic changes in the psychological makeup of 
people that have occurred over the last seven decades. 
  But there is no return to this life. I do not believe that 
Ukraine is in danger of losing her independence, but Russia's 
imperialistic policy will remain imperialistic. Unfortunately, 
it will also continue to be chauvinistic, inasmuch as both 
Russia's centrists and liberals are unable to resist the 
pressure of Russian nationalists, particularly in their attitude 
towards Ukraine. 
  The third course is a political one. I have in mind 
democratic changes. There are countless problems, including some 
that we forget about for some reason. Who will own the land? Who 
will control resources? Municipalities? Councils? Which 
councils? Everything will depend on how these issues are 
settled. And what about our so-called public and social life -- 
the helplessness of our political parties, the inanition of our 
press?.. 
  Our society today is reminiscent of what Mussolini dreamed 
of 
once --corporativism. It is broken up into corporations. The 
miner does not strike against those who exploit him, but -- 
together with the mine director -- against another sector. There 
is solidarity where no solidarity should exist. There is no 
labor movement. That is why every political endeavor comes to 
nothing, like rings in the water: many rocks on the bottom, yet 
the surface of the water remains smooth... 
  [Oliynyk] In your view, is polarization, the clash of 
opposing views, the greatest danger threatening our parliament? 
  [Popovych] I do not think that this poses a danger. All 
these 
things will sort themselves out, and a process of regrouping 
will occur... To the best of my knowledge, at least two-thirds 
of the newly elected deputies from the Communist Party are 
workers rather than hardened politicos. Albeit with a definite 
political orientation. I do not excuse their views -- it is 
disgraceful that after decades of years of the filth in which we 
lived, there are still people who stake their hopes on this form 
of existence. But what can we do? Nonetheless, I am convinced 
that these people are different, and when they sit down in the 
sessions hall and face the need to solve the burning issues of 
the day, they will think quite differently. 
  What is absolutely unproductive is recalling what this or 
that politician did during the era of Soviet power. As far as I 
know, there are some problems in this respect even among the 
Ukrainian Self-Defense Forces [UNSO]. The past is not what we 
should be thinking about; we all share the same past. Except for 
those who hurled themselves headlong against the wall and were 
fortunate enough to survive. But there are not many such people. 
  Strictly speaking, we all have a general idea of what needs 
to be done. We need to divide our enterprises into three 
categories: those that the state has to support no matter what, 
those that must be allowed to make their own way, and those that 
have to be closed down. If, as they say, the Black Sea Fleet 
consumes as much as all of our science and scholarship, we have 
to decide what is more important to us. I believe that culture 
and science must come first, otherwise our state is threatened 
by paralysis of its central nervous system. We must conduct 
conversion. [We must] set optimum tax rates rather than trying 
to squeeze out as much as we can by grabbing people by the 
throat. The problem is not what to do, but how to do it in such 
a way as to ensure that we move a step ahead every day and to 
ensure that every step increases effective demand. Only then 
will we see reforms happen. There is no place to retreat -- 
behind us lies Moscow, and the pressure it exerts is palpable. 
  [Oliynyk] Myroslav Volodymyrovych, do you agree with the 
currently very fashionable claim that alleges that the office of 
the presidency is alien to the Ukrainian mentality? 
  [Popovych] I take a very ironic approach to all this talk of 
a Ukrainian mentality. What does it mean? Where did we unearth 
this notion? No doubt about it, this is a very convenient way of 
explaining and justifying just about anything -- you see, it's 
not part of our mentality. 
  Whereas the characteristic features of the Ukrainian state 
are that this is a country in which one-third of the population 
lives in villages and two-thirds live in cities. Half of those 
living in cities are first or second-generation urban dwellers. 
Most of these people work in highly advanced technical sectors; 
they are the elite of the world's technical civilization. his is 
precisely the culture -- that of a military-technical colossus 
-- that the Bolsheviks created and did so deliberately. But the 
humanitarian core of all this is very weak. We have huge muscles 
and a very small brain. That, if you will, is our mentality. But 
to say that the office of the presidency is an impediment -- 
forgive me, but... However, the institution of presidential 
representatives has some negative features. Without even giving 
the local councils a chance to begin feeling accountable to the 
people, the state administration began to meddle in local 
affairs. Now, when the buses run badly, the people berate 
Kravchuk. Such a system is fine for a country with established 
bureaucratic traditions -- a country like France, for example. 
  owever, on the whole, we need the presidency and firm 
authority. Obviously, the powers of the president have to be 
clearly defined. In the United States, for example, the states 
and cities have a high degree of independence, and therefore the 
American president can have full powers. Here, the situation is 
different. 
  [Oliynyk] And what do you think about the presidential 
election in June? 
  [Popovych] The choice will not be easy. There is no ideal 
candidate. In general, the decision to hold early elections to 
the Supreme Council and of the president, which the former 
parliament passed under pressure from the miners' strikes, was 
illegitimate and capitulatory. This was the wrong thing to do. 
But inasmuch as this decision was made, and parliament has been 
elected, we must finish resolving these issues. We gain nothing 
by putting off settling this matter until the fall. Having said 
"a," we have to say "b." My only hope is that whoever is elected 
president will have to move forward with reforms.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Yelenskyy, Kiev: "The Crusaders: </F>
Ukrainian Churches and Great Politics!"] 
  [Text] A Group Portrait of the old parliament would be 
incomplete without a tall white cowl of the then-Metropolitan of 
Vinnytsya and Bratslav Ahafanhel, that formed a nice contrast to 
the grey suits in the halls of parliament. Deputy Savin (as he 
was known in lay life) was always polite and courteous, voted 
but, it seems, never once gave a speech. His calling allowed him 
to talk only from the pulpit, but everybody was aware that the 
church had a presence in the parliament. 
  There are no clergymen among the deputies now. But the 
church 
was much more active in the March elections than four years ago. 
And if there are no vestments in the new parliament it does not 
mean that the devotees of the cult--so to say--have given up 
politics and limited themselves solely to communicating with 
God. On the contrary, the social profile of the church activists 
is on the increase. One does not have to go far to see the 
vehemence with which the Catholic Church is attempting to 
`theocratize' Poland. We see the confluence of church and state 
in Ukraine and attempts at indirect influence. Having recovered 
from repressive state control, Church activists quickly captured 
the trust of a people devastated by atheism. The confusion of 
the post-perestroika years has been replaced by awareness of 
their political interests and might, and the utility of front 
men. 
  Article 5 of the Public Laws of Ukraine on "Freedom of 
Conscience and Religious Organizations" states quite clearly 
that churches cannot "advance candidates for elections to 
governing bodies, nor promote or finance election campaigns." 
But such paper barriers obviously are not enough to control the 
ambitions and interests of church leaders vis-a-vis lay matters. 
As Post-Postup predicted a last spring, all Ukrainian churches 
were active in the elections. Since more elections are scheduled 
this year, we can prophesize that this activity was just the 
beginning. 
  The Ukrainian Autocephalic Orthodox Church (UAOC) publicized 
its elections credo in spring of 1993. The UAOC called its 
adherents to vote for believing christians to repel atheists who 
lack "any moral credentials." But the heavens seemed to favor 
the latter in elections. Father Chudinov, who stood for 
elections in the Snihuriv Electoral District in Mykolayiv 
Oblast, had his church set on fire by some goons, while the 
chancellor of the UAOC, Fr. Yuriy Boyko, survived the firs bout 
of elections in Shpolyanshchyna area (Cherkasy Oblast), but then 
lost big to Oleksander Tkachenko, a former minister of 
agriculture and a leader of the socialist movement. 
  Nor did Vitaliy Zhuravskyy win; he heads the Christian 
Democratic Party (CDP) which is simpatico with the UAOC. He may 
have counted on some other support since he ran in the Marynskyy 
district in Zhytomyr Oblast where UAOC is weak. Still, the UAOC 
can count on two deputies from the CDP and Serhiy Holovatyy. 
Holovatyy is one of the leading proponents of a reviews of the 
legality of the Common Orthodox Sobor, held in June 1992, that 
deprived UAOC of its official status. 
  The Ukrainian Orthodox Church--Kiev Patriarchate (UOC-KP), a 
more clever competitor of the UAOC, issued a sharp appeal to the 
faithful before the elections. They hit hard at the fifth 
columnists, betrayers of the Black Sea fleet, and external 
enemies. In two words, the essence of the appeal was to vote for 
"true patriots." This patriotism has several interesting 
features, including the recent elevation of Metropolitan 
Volodymyr (Romanyuk)--a former religious dissident--to a 
patriarch. Then there are the close ties between the UOC-KP and 
the government as well as with personages connected with the 
former Congress of National Democratic Forces. In short, the 
clergy seem to be more catholic than the pope--after all, before 
and during the first few months of Ukrainian independence many 
of the highest UOC-KP hierarchs were on the other side of the 
barricades. 
  If one is to believe the Moscow news agency IMA-Press, sixty 
percent of the candidates running for parliament in Kiev 
declared their devotion to Patriarch Volodymyr before March 27. 
My observations showed a steady stream of politicians to the 
hierarchy's reception rooms during spring, as well as to other 
ecclesiastical luminaries in their districts. 
  This was, however, a two-way street. In Ukraine the mountain 
and Mohammed take turns visiting each other. The leaders of 
UOC-KP visited the Rivne region where two powerful figures in 
Ukrainian Orthodoxy, Vasyl Chervoniy and Mykola Porovskyy, both 
members of the Supreme Church Council, were successful 
candidates. But a third lay member of the council, Oles 
Shevchenko, was less successful despite a patriarchal visit and 
Oleksander Moroz, leader of the Ukrainian Socialist Party, 
emerged victorious. Nor did patriarchal efforts help Svitlana Li 
in the Kharkiv District in Kiev. Still, having Porovskyy and 
Chervoniy in parliament assures the UOC-KP that its interests 
will be protected. 
  The Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church (UGCC) is also taken 
care 
of in the parliament. In Galicia, especially in the rural 
districts, a word from their priests made a decisive difference 
in an election. The only question was the delicate manner in 
which the hint was given to avoid breaking the law. But the 
names that were mentioned with sympathy in the rectories of 
Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil wound up as deputies--Volodymyr 
Pylypchuk, Vyacheslav Chornovil, Yevhen Pronyuk and others. 
  The UGCC hierarchy strongly favored the rightists and 
rightist centrists. But they also favored liberals--although 
seeing in them a threat to their puritanical philosophy--and 
extreme radicals. At St. George's Hill they noted that 
nazism-fascism is no better than communism and both should be 
kept from emerging. In fact, the legendary Metropolitan 
Sheptytskyy had already expressed those sentiments in 1942. 
  The UGCC had outlined its views in a pre-election message: 
"Epistle of the UGCC Hierarchy on the Occasion of the March 27, 
1994 Parliamentary Elections." The bishops advised saying `No' 
to the political system of the past and irrational 
centralization, and `Yes' to Ukrainian independence and 
democracy, private property and the new constitution. The future 
deputies were reminded of Christ's maxim: you were elected to 
serve and even give your life for others, not to be served. 
  The Ukrainian Orthodox Church--Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) 
was most consistent in not popularizing its political tastes, 
perhaps because the candidates themselves avoided affiliation 
with a collaborationist church. Perhaps it was due dissent 
within the church. Still, adherents of the UOC-MP count in the 
thousands and thousands and their parishes dominate in 22 
Ukrainian oblasts (except for the three Galician oblasts.) My 
view is that Metropolitan Volodymyr (Sabodan) is not indifferent 
to the outcome of the elections. 
  Nevertheless, the confessional synod of the UOC-MP allowed 
two of its hierarchs to run (unsuccessfully) in the 
elections--Avhustyn (Markovych), Bishop of Lviv and Drohobych, 
and Sofroniy (Dmytruk), Bishop of Cherkasy and Kiev. 
Interestingly, the MP had forbidden its bishops and other 
clergymen from running for the Russian Duma since such duties 
would interfere with the divine duties of pastoral care. Father 
Hlib Yakunin ran for the Duma and was defrocked. Even as a 
dissident in Brezhnev's time he was treated more gently and 
simply forbidden to hold services. 
  What are we to make of this? Either there is a conflict 
between Kiev and Moscow or Patriarch Alexei's court feels that 
two disparate approaches to politics are called for in Ukraine 
and Russia. 
  Avhustyn and Sofroniy, as well as father Anatoliy 
Kyrychenko, 
who ran in Fastivka, Kiev region, should have been aware of 
their noncompliance with apostolic decrees. But willful 
noncompliance was and is a church tradition and the position of 
the UOC-MP is quite uncomfortable at the present time, 
particularly since their colleagues in the other Ukrainian 
churches did not shy away from politics. 
  Through it all the protestants remained remarkably calm and 
quiet. Nowhere in Ukraine do they form a compact electorate-- 
except Hungarian reformists in Transcarpathia, but that is a 
nationality issue--and the candidates ignored them. However, had 
elections been held on a proportional basis, the 300,000 
disciplined protestants could have been heard from. 
  These ruminations exclude Jehovah's Witnesses who during 
Soviet times avoided having anything to do with temporal affairs 
and refused to vote. On the other hand Baptists, Pentecostal 
Christians, and Seventh Day Adventists--who account for most 
Ukrainian protestants--did their civic duty. On March 20 the 
Baptists even proclaimed a day of fasting and special prayers 
for the elections. Leaders of the protestant communities 
supported centrist candidates who would not drag the country 
back to socialism or promote dubious innovations. Since the 
traditional churches are not very welcoming to these believers, 
in the future only those candidates who advocate freedom of 
religion and legal equality of all churches will be able to 
count on their support. 
  In Conclusion, it appears that keeping churches out of 
politics is as unattainable as the Ten Commandments. Churches 
are, after all, social institutions with tens of millions of 
members. The effectiveness of their pastoral care depends on 
worldly realities. Some commentators have even attribute the 
fall of communism to the Vatican, while others feel it was due 
to a desire to replace a foreign ideology by our own. 
  There are principal differences between churches with finely 
honed political aims and those that seek to protect the weak 
from the "powerful of this world." There are the stirring 
examples of Bishop Midszenty who opposed the pro-Moscow and 
pro-Stalinist regime in Budapest, Father Tekesz who helped bring 
down Ceausescu, and our own martyr, Metropolitan Yosyp Slipyy. 
But then there are also contrary examples. 
  President Leonid Kravchuk noted with some trepidation on the 
eve of the elections that "...recently various political forces 
have attempted to subvert the authority of the Church to their 
ends in the upcoming parliamentary elections." He took the 
appropriate steps to control such machinations...but the 
skeptics pointed out that the Presidential Press Service made 
similar announcements a year ago on May 26. Nobody, of course, 
paid any attention to this and elections have become a tradition 
in Ukraine. Just a glance on the goings-on makes it easy to tell 
which local or presidential candidates have been blessed by an 
ecclesiastical hand and which have not.

  [Text] One of the local newspapers, referring to the 
results of parliamentary elections in Donbass, headlined that if 
Ukraine wants to conduct an independent policy it will have to 
separate itself from the eastern region. To wit: it is not 
Donbass that should demand independence, it is Ukraine that 
could be free of its obligations to the industrial region which, 
if one is to believe the press, feeds and clothes itself, "it is 
at the same time both the orchestra and the audience." 
  Such a super-radical view of the issue is gaining popularity 
among the increasingly lumpen population mass. An eloquent 
indication of that consist not only of the outcome of the oblast 
referendum on the entry of Ukraine (read: Donbass) as a 
full-fledged member into the CIS and a certain European Economic 
Community, on a federative land structure of an independent 
state and on the granting of the status of a second state 
language for the Russian language, but also of the tactic that 
was selected on the eve of new elections by leaders of the local 
national-democratic organizations. For example, the kray Rukh 
firmly decided to boycott elections to local organs of power 
since there are no chances even for episodic breaks in the 
communist party nomenklatura blockade. Therefore let the Reds 
bear responsibility for the state of affairs in the stagnant 
preserve. Igor Laponogov, a member of the presidium of the 
oblast organization of social democrats and a former candidate 
for people's deputies, was even more frank at one of the 
democratic meetings: "We have no serious grounds for objecting 
to the separation of Ukraine from Donbass if power there will 
belong entirely to the communists." 
  Observers, however, are not in any hurry to assert that 
after 
elections to the local soviets from rural regions to the oblast 
center the East is now colored in red. Yes, Vadim Chuprun, 
chairman of the oblast soviet, in announcing his candidacy for 
the post of chairman of the oblast soviet, made a point of 
declaring restoration of membership in the Communist Party of 
Ukraine, but his more sober-minded colleagues, heading the power 
organs, so far have preferred not to hover up in the clouds, but 
to stand firmly on the ground and rely on tested means: 
executive structures, trade unions, state enterprises, and local 
business. It is likely that they will be the ones able to 
realistically count on victory, the more so since the so-called 
"new" communists, whose ranks are swelling with pensioners 
languishing for old prices, readily vote in the electoral 
districts not for a bright tomorrow, but for the trash heap that 
was removed and for several kilograms of charity food today. 
  That is why considerably greater interest is aroused not by 
the reincarnated communist V. Chuprun, but by the outcome of the 
duel between two other contenders for the governor's seat, two 
people's deputies of Ukraine who are well-known businessmen in 
the region, two individuals with the same name--Vladimir and 
Yevgeniy Shcherbanya. It is unlikely that their programs will 
differ any more than their names. The issue is something else: 
who has the money and connections that will prove to be 
strongest.

<F P=106> Article by S. Furmanyuk: "A Coal Face Argument"] </F>
  [Text] It is unlikely that the visit by L. Kravchuk 
to Yenakiyevo, the site of a meeting of the president with 
directors of coal, by-product coke, and metallurgical 
enterprises, will clarify anything in the complex mutual 
relations between the center and the oblast. 
  Leonid Makarovich, naturally, was unable to refuse the 
directors their request to do everything possible to halt the 
collapse of the economy and production. He promised to help with 
the settlement of unpaid accounts between enterprises and with 
the granting of extensive technical credits for the basic 
branches. But in return he took back to Kiev with him what he 
came for. At a joint meeting an appeal to the parliament and the 
government was adopted (with the president as the third 
addressee) proposing the ensurance of order and prosperity in 
the country through the transfer of local and presidential 
elections to a later more "feasible" date and the introduction 
of strict presidential rule. 
  Local political leaders have not had time yet to comment on 
the results of the conference at Yenakiyevo, but it is unlikely 
that the results will have any effect on the mood at the 
grassroots level. It seems that no one is trusted any longer. No 
matter how insistently Yu. Belomestnov, director of the 
Oktyabrskoye Mine Administration, appealed to his workers to 
halt the strike that started on Saturday 14 May, for example, 
they refused to go down to the coal face. 
  "It is better to go hungry on the surface, than to work 
hungry in the mine," declared Petr Moyseyenko, deputy chairman 
of the local Independent Miner's Union, and that argument 
outweighed all of the reasoning by the administration which 
showing the miners that "things are what they are." In April the 
administration fulfilled the state order in full shipping coal 
to consumers but the wages are yet to be credited to the 
bursary. At the Abakumov mine, however, which is officially 
designated as a priority candidate for closure, wages were paid 
to the workers on time. At Donetsk they are certain that this is 
not a coincidence. It was specifically the labor collective at 
Abakumov mine which turned out to be the only one in Donbass to 
have nominated I. Plyushch, the former speaker of parliament, as 
candidate for president. That is why "things are what they are 
there." Are the leaders of state enterprises in the oblast 
expecting similar "pressing economic measures," having supported 
the president on the rescheduling of elections set for June?

NEZAVISIMOST parliamentary correspondents: "Is Communism Once 
Again As Close As It Was in 1919?"] 
  [Text] Oleksandr Moroz has been elected chairman of 
the Supreme Council of Ukraine. Democrats counting on centrist 
Vasiliy Durdinets lost the election of speaker by just a couple 
of points. 
  History teaches us that its lessons are never learned... We 
will not take it upon ourselves to pass judgment on the state of 
memory in other countries, but, for us who live in Ukraine, 
memory is quite short. It is as though the four years separating 
us from the May days of 1990 did not transpire. Why such a 
historical digression? Well, the events of 18 May of this year 
in the Ukrainian parliament are painfully reminiscent of that 
scenario. 
  True, four years ago everything was decided beforehand. The 
"leading and guiding" party resolved at its plenum to elect 
Vladimir Ivashko, first secretary of the Central Committee of 
the Ukrainian Communist Party, as chairman of the Supreme 
Council of the Ukrainian SSR. Though reduced at that time 
basically to a declaration of political pluralism, the 
nomination of aspirants from our young democracy to this 
position was still of some use to society. For the first time, a 
call to reject hegemonism and refrain from electing yet another 
party leader as speaker resounded under the arches of the 
parliament. A neutral, centrist figure could bring accord to 
society. But the Communist majority in the hall shouted and 
stamped, listening to itself and deciding things its own way. 
How did it all wind up? In August of 1991. It is a blessing that 
Ukraine managed to avoid more serious upheaval. 
  A similar situation was observed last Wednesday--with the 
one 
difference that almost all those seeking the position of Supreme 
Council chairman declared their centrist orientation. But when 
the time came for former First Deputy Speaker Vasiliy Durdinets 
and leader of the Socialists Oleksandr Moroz to present their 
programs, it became clear that it was between them that the 
fight for the post of chairman would ensue. The former, not 
formally connected with party factions in the parliament, 
appeared to be the most centrist figure among the contenders. 
While the leftist portion of the parliament immediately sided 
with the latter. The Communists also resolved at their plenum to 
support Moroz--the chairman of the Political Council of the 
Socialist Party. A promising unification of leftist forces, 
correct? 
  The uninterrupted string of conferences of deputy groups and 
factions only served to add the finishing touches. On behalf of 
future accord and rejecting party ambitions, the leaders of Rukh 
[Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka] and the Democratic 
Party, Vyacheslav Chornovil and Vladimir Yavorivskyy, withdrew 
their candidacies. Mikhail Pavlovskyy, representative of the 
Republicans, followed their example. Just a little more, it 
would seem, and good judgment would fall upon the hall of 
parliament. Just a bit more, and Ukraine would get its first 
nonparty speaker. But loyal to Bolshevist traditions, the 
Communists, Socialists, and like-minded people were not about to 
begin acting on principle--the interests of the party above all 
else! 
  Yuriy Tima and Oleksandr Karpov, the deputy from Kharkov, 
decided they too would stay the course along with Oleksandr 
Moroz and Vasiliy Durdinets. But Tima and Karpov were just 
extras. Discussion of the four candidacies turned into a sham. 
Now and again there resounded in the hall fiery appeals to the 
leader of the Socialists--"remain loyal to your banner," 
"maintain conviction in the rightness of the cause," "loyalty to 
the charted course." Then the uninterrupted ovations. How 
familiar it all was! Too late, all too late did Vyacheslav 
Chornovil suddenly remember, perceiving the malevolent ruse in 
formation of the list of speakers, drawn up contrary to 
regulations not by the Rada system, but in the secretariat of 
the parliament. The result of the secret voting was 
predetermined. Oleksandr Moroz was elected chairman of the 
Supreme Council, receiving 171 votes--169 were necessary. 
  It still remains for Ukraine to interpret what took place in 
the parliament last Wednesday. Triumph for some, frustration for 
others. So it would seem once again that accord was just an 
alluring apparition to our legislators. 
  But what exactly took place? Figures of familiar hue will 
continue to rule us. It would be naive at the very least to 
perceive the Ukrainian socialists as true centrists. This is not 
France, Sweden, or Austria... We do not doubt the wisdom of 
politician Oleksandr Moroz, or his desire to introduce accord 
both in society and in the parliament. But will he be 
successful? Or will he slide over to the leftmost fringe of 
politics, assisted by his friends and comrades-in-arms in the 
Communist and Socialist Parties? This is what is alarming. In 
addition to everything else, the election of the speaker has 
revealed a noticeable striving on the part of a significant 
portion of our legislators to begin once again to build a bright 
Communist future. This time--in an as yet independent Ukraine. 
But if this does not turn out--and there are such feelings in 
the parliament--we can again move to the Union. 
  Of course, today is not 1990. A great deal will depend on 
the 
actions of the Democrats. Will they join the structures of 
authority, or will they be forced to form a distant opposition? 
In the first case, they run the risk of turning into hostages of 
that same old system; and, in the second--of being regarded as a 
destructive force. 
  One thing is clear--that the time has not yet arrived for 
true reformers in Ukraine. The coming presidential elections 
will change little here. That scenario is akin to the 
parliamentary one. The roles were assigned long, long ago. But 
now the fate of independent and democratic Ukraine--is not 
clear... 
  The day of 19 May began in the parliament with consultations 
and discussions in deputy groups and factions of the possible 
nominations for deputy chairmanship of the Supreme Council and 
the chairmanships of committees and commissions.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Andreyeva: "Are the Centrists Raising </F>
a Wave?"] 
  [Text] Lvov--The Lvov preelection association New 
Wave is registered as a permanently active public organization. 
There is reason to suppose that this is not just a regional 
event. 
  First of all, the New Wave leaders, and they are People's 
Deputies Mykhaylo Kostyv, Viktor Pynzenyk, Taras Stetskyv, and 
the young politician Igor Grynyv, who is well-known from the 
parliament of the last convocation, are perhaps not persons of a 
regional scale. And it seems that the question concerns a 
tendency. If you will permit me a small pun--a wave rises, when 
the foam subsides... 
  I do not know what the diplomaed political scientists will 
say, but it seems to me: The phenomenon matured at a logical 
time. Only high tones could be heard and two colors could be 
viewed in a period when totalitarian walls and bars were being 
pulled down and at the time of yet another fermentation of 
ideas, intellects, and speeches. It was necessary later at least 
to go through a rudimentary restructuring of political forces. 
And also to experience a certain disappointment in the existing 
organizations and parties. This is what affects factors that in 
a positive way influence the possibility of the emergence of 
fruitful work of regional or global associations of 
reform-minded centrist-democrats. Of course, there is also the 
negative factor--red and blue-yellow "Sharikov's" who are ready 
"to divide everything" and to jail those over and over whom they 
do not hang, are growing like mushrooms on the threshold of the 
key posts of a society that is rolling into the abyss. Thus, 
everything occurs at the conjunction of a paradox: A 
catastrophic economy and a stagnating state structure 
persistently require the intervention of those who are capable 
of making anything that is real and civilized. And the very same 
aforementioned troubles do not let the centrists expand: The 
people are not inclined either to mature to a sensible choice, 
nor to trust anyone, and, indeed, not much time is allotted... 
  The Lvov New Wave was born during the recent preelection 
campaign and with the purpose of participating in it. Not bound 
by party limits and the "long-playing" obligations that 
intimidated the intelligentsia from time immemorial, it was able 
to assemble not only a fair circle of candidates for parliament, 
but also rather good company around the candidates, if it can be 
expressed this way. Intellectual, young, and pragmatic. As our 
newspaper has already written, the result of the elections, 
proceeding from the fact that the association could not use the 
halo of past feats and did not tickle the sensitive centers of 
the lovers of rallies, can be called not bad. Here is something 
else that is interesting: No one was cursed as much, and no one 
was fought against as hard by all possible kinds of extremists. 
Stepan Khmara, for example, being already elected, dropped all 
of his affairs and traveled all around the district of a 
candidate from New Wave who was not familiar to him, desperately 
agitating against him. The candidate, by the way, was elected. 
  Just before the local elections, visitors began to come to 
New Wave frequently: Many potential candidates wanted to 
associate their preelection fate specifically with this 
association. There is this feature--among the New Wave nominees 
to the city council today, there are members of the URP 
[Ukrainian Republican Party], the KUN [Congress of Ukrainian 
Nationalists], and the SOU [Ukrainian Officers Union]. Both this 
and other facts indicate: In the Galicia region, the "seismic 
waves," as the group is sometimes referred to teasingly, have 
come into their own under the political sun. And in doing this, 
they got rid of the adjective "electoral" before the word 
"association." The talk turned to a new social movement. Let us 
put it this way, there was nothing unusual in the proclamation 
documents and speeches at the first conference. It was rather 
transparently stated that the New Wave considers itself one of 
the components of a future democratic center (read--party). But, 
not being a party, at this stage it calls on the unity and 
cooperation of all who share the key postulates: the formation 
of a Ukrainian national state, orientation of Ukraine on 
integration in Europe, and the formation of a civil society and 
a rule-of-law state. It should be added that on economic 
questions the New Wave supports a market economy, orienting 
itself on Viktor Pynzenyk's program. 
  What are we dealing with this time? With yet another 
fragmentation of the national-democratic movement, or actually, 
with absorption, and does this means a uniting of healthy 
forces? The "eggheads" traditionally lost to the Bolsheviks from 
the aspect of the mass character and organization of basic 
cells. Today, branches of the Lvov New Wave are appearing in the 
rayon centers; moreover, this process is really coming from 
below and not from above. Will it come to a halt after the local 
elections, or will it continue? Incidentally, it is exactly the 
local elections that can become a trampoline, but they can, just 
the opposite, bury the new movement. The fact is that the 
"'Piemonte' of the national renewal" (probably no one in all 
Galicia can pronounce these words any longer today without 
irony) cannot brag about economic successes. In the event that 
the New Wave and its allies receive a sufficient number of seats 
to the local organs of authority, Viktor Pynzenyk, and other 
prominent economists, promise to implement a regional program of 
reforms here with the involvement of the best forces. If the 
seats are present and there are no positive accomplishments, 
even because of global or national reasons, the disappointment 
will be fierce. A final resolution of the "East-West" problem 
was not within the capability of either Rukh [Ukrainian People's 
Movement for Perestroyka], or URP. The new centrist 
organizations seem to have the grounds for becoming a 
consolidating factor: Standing on indisputable positions of 
independence and statehood, they do not regard wide trousers, or 
even language, of paramount importance. This plus has an 
opposite side--it is for this reason that this kind of a 
movement will become the object of a tough struggle on the part 
of extremists in both the West and in the East. But how will the 
fraternal organizations behave? Will Rukh and URP like the fact 
that, figuratively speaking, a new little horse is entering the 
field, nipping at the general electorate? 
  As always, there are more questions than answers at the 
moment of birth. It is unlikely that astrologists will help. 
Mykhaylo Kostyv, of course, was joking: New Wave received its 
registration certificate on St. George's day. And George, as is 
well-known, is a dragon-slayer. Shall we end on this optimistic 
note?

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Lanovyy, doctor of economic sciences, </F>
under the rubric "The Economy": "The Metronome of the Economic 
Crisis"] 
  [Text] The critically complex economic condition of Ukraine 
demands an unbiased analysis of the sources, causes and factors 
of its decline, as well as an analysis of those forces and 
processes which are capable of either accelerating or stopping 
it. The time has come to make generalizations that will give us 
the capability of understanding the nature of the present 
macroeconomic phenomona and consciously choosing the way toward 
revival. 
<H5>  The Sources of Crisis </H5>
  The economic crisis in Ukraine has lasted a long time. It 
began in 1980-81, when the average annual growth of the gross 
social product fell from more than 3% during the 
preceding two 
years to 1.5-1.8%. The causes of the crisis lie in the 
ineffectiveness of the old cost-based, wasteful, 
planning-subjectivist system of economic management. As we know, 
this system was incapable of promoting the distribution of 
goods, capital, and manpower resources according to the real 
needs of society. As a result, the structure of social capital, 
its division among the different sectors, as well as the quality 
of capital projects in terms of technological levels, physical 
conditions, and cost recovery, were in conflict with the 
structure and quality requirements of social consumption. It 
should be noted that in the case of Ukraine, as in the case of 
other non-Russian states that made up the Soviet Union, the 
structure of capital distribution by sectors and the 
distribution of manpower resources was further distorted by an 
artificially created demand on the part of enterprises and 
residents of Russia and other former republics (demand for 
output to meet defense needs, cultivating the boundless northern 
and far-eastern territories, ambitious projects in space and in 
the pro-Communist Afro-Asian countries, etc.). As a result, the 
deformation of the structure of the economy went further in 
Ukraine than in Russia, Poland, or Bulgaria, and, thus, the 
decline in production may be greater. Not only must Ukraine 
reorient her production to meet real domestic demand, but she 
must find new foreign markets, abandoning those she had 
developed in the past. This requires technological adjustments, 
additional spending on marketing, standardization, and ensuring 
that products are competitive in terms of both cost and price. 
  The crisis that began 12 years ago began to display more 
clearly distinguishable features at the beginning of 1992. The 
liberalization from state control of the overwhelming majority 
of prices and the self-collapse of the system of state-planned 
distribution of production exposed the crisis that existing 
enterprises were in and the fact that many of the goods they 
produced were unneeded. A tectonic rupture took place in the 
planning stream of the economic crisis. Simultaneously (although 
this occurred over a certain period of time), thousands of 
former economic ties were broken. The explosive transition to a 
new price level did not give enterprises enough time to 
accumulate working capital without interrupting the production 
process. The economy went into shock and remains in this 
condition to this day. The rate of production decline over two 
years has surpassed 35.0% (the first year in which the 
national 
product fell was 1991, when the decrease reached 4.0%), 
and 
there are no signs of stabilization in sight. 
  The long duration of the crisis stems from the fact that the 
contradictions created in the national economic system run very 
deep (they are, of course, also present in other states of the 
former Soviet Union). Until the structure and nature of social 
capital are strengthened (by changing the specialization of 
existing enterprises and modernizing their manufacturing 
processes, building new production and infrastructure facilities 
which would make it possible to meet the unsatisfied demand for 
goods and services, retraining and shifting manpower resources 
from certain sectors into others, reconstructing obsolete 
transportation and communication systems), there can be no real 
revival of production growth. 
<H5>  The Characteristic Features and Course of the Crisis </H5>
  So far, the crisis has not engendered any factors to produce 
structural and technological revival. While during the first 
years, until the beginning of 1993, the crisis caused economic 
losses to enterprises by making it impossible for them to work 
at full capacity, for the past year and more, the crisis has 
been creating conditions in which these capacities are being 
physically destroyed. The cause is inflation, which in December 
1992 surpassed the 50% mark, in July 1993, the 60% 
mark, and 
in December 1993, the 90% mark. As we can see, inflation 
is 
steadily rising (let us recall that in June 1992, before the 
beginning of the state "financial and credit narcotization" of 
enterprises, price growth amounted to only 20%). 
  Inflation, which exceeds 40-50% per month, prevents 
enterprises from replacing their fixed capital. New construction 
is completely out of the question. Thus inflation sharply 
accelerates the rate of production decline, and hyperinflation 
completely halts structural changes in the economy. 
  A second distinguishing feature of the economic crisis is a 
step-like [stupenepodibnyy] movement of price levels. These 
price levels are not rising according to plan; they change at 
given intervals (every two to three months), increasing each 
time by a factor of two to three or four to five. We have 
already experienced seven such increases. This is happening due 
to the permissive administrative price review procedure, which, 
in fact, consists of the state establishing prices for most 
products (officially, two-thirds of all prices). After each 
price review, business entities and ordinary consumers 
experience inflationary shock: Their profits, incomes, or 
earnings prove insufficient to allow them to buy materials and 
goods as well as services in the same volumes as they were able 
to afford earlier. This leads to sociopolitical explosions and 
conflicts, strikes, meetings, hunger strikes, etc., that take 
place in the same sequence as the price hikes. [Boxed item: 

  -  The budget deficit in the first half of 1994 will be 
higher than in the first half of 1993 and will amount to 35-40\ 
  -  of total expenditures. 
  -  Within half a year, the exchange rate of the karbovanets will 
fall to 180,000-190,000 to the U.S. dollar. 
  -  Production decreases will result in mass unemployment in the 
first half of 1994. An increase in emigration should be 
expected.] 

  On the one hand, this phasal inflation disturbs the 
financial 
proportions that have formed since the preceding price increase 
and strips enterprises of their working capital and banks of 
adequate amounts of credit resources. This leads to mass 
nonpayments and blockages in goods turnover. On the other hand, 
it is impossible to achieve a balance between the money supply 
and the supply of goods: after the new prices are set, the total 
value of goods exceeds the amount of available means of payment. 
After a while, when enterprise and personal incomes are 
compensated by government emission and the fixed prices lag 
behind the growth of the money supply, the supply of goods 
becomes insufficient. From that moment on, both producer and 
consumer goods become scarce and disappear from the state trade 
network. 
  The third "national" feature of the economic crisis in 
Ukraine is the unwarranted falling of the living standard, which 
has now lasted more than three years. During this period, 
average real incomes have decreased nearly 45% (at a time 
when 
earnings have been growing in many neighboring countries -- 
Russia, Moldova, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia). As a result of 
this trend, economic sectors that serve the consumer are 
collapsing. Thus, according to our estimates, consumer services 
have shrunk by 70%, the physical volume of state trade -- 
by 
45%, the food industry -- by 40%, the output of 
milk products 
-- by 50%, and the output of clothing and footwear -- by 
55%. 
  The falling living standard leads directly to the shrinking 
of the domestic market and a further recession among 
goods-manufacturing enterprises due to a reduced demand for 
their products. If we take into account that personal savings 
have virtually melted away (the amount remaining in banks, 
calculated in real terms, has decreased ten-twelvefold), then 
effective consumer demand has decreased more than 2.2-2.4-fold. 
  There are two main reasons why the living standard is 
falling: a) the large-scale redistribution of monetary revenues 
through budgetary and banking mechanisms to benefit the 
raw-materials branches of industry and the military-industrial 
complex, and b) the large, disproportionate export of capital 
abroad (both to the West and to Russia) by export enterprises, 
which then conceal their foreign currency earnings abroad (only 
some 20% of this sum returned to Ukraine in 1993). These 
are 
the "national" characteristics of the methods of financial and 
currency regulation used by our government. This three-sided 
financial background of the economic crisis in Ukraine 
(hyperinflation, step-like [stupenepodibni] changes in price 
levels, and decreasing consumer purchasing power) not only 
blocks the action of internal stimuli and economic growth, but 
increasingly undermines the economy and causes the level of 
production to decline even further. We can predict that in the 
next few months hyperinflation will also accelerate the drop in 
the production of goods for domestic consumption. In addition, 
the vigorous outflow of foreign currency will continue (as a 
result of the import restrictions introduced by the 
Kravchuk-Zvyahilskyy government and the worsening domestic 
economic conditions). Consequently, personal incomes in Ukraine 
will continue to drop in 1994. 
<H5>  The Nature of the Course of the Crisis </H5>
  Today's production decline in Ukraine is not accompanied by 
positive structural changes -- in other words, the crisis is 
producing no healing effects. What is more, the impact of the 
principal tendencies of the crisis is destructive to the economy. 
  First, the decline of obsolete traditional industries is not 
taking place at an accelerated rate; the output volumes of these 
industries are falling at the same rate as the rate for industry 
as a whole. Modern industries and technologies are either not 
being widely introduced, or the scale on which they are being 
assimilated and are functioning is not expanding. This is 
blocking the structural changes that could vitalize the rate of 
growth of the economy as a whole and ultimately reduce the 
energy- and material-output ratio in industry, agriculture, and 
transport. 
  Second, the functioning national capital is not being 
transformed from production into financial form: enterprises and 
private citizens are not placing their money in bank deposits or 
investing it in securities, but are rushing to exchange it for 
goods. In addition, there is an increased demand for money, 
above all, bank credits (which, as a rule, is a characteristic 
feature of the stage in which an economy is growing and not of 
the stage in which it is declining). A financial system in this 
condition means that existing production is conserved rather 
than modernized. No sources of investment into new branches and 
kinds of activity emerge in society. 
  Third, there is no growth in output in those branches of the 
economy which produce goods and services for the population -- 
in other words, in the sphere in which the socialist system 
continually recreated a supply deficit. Instead, these are the 
very sectors in which production decline is greatest. As long as 
this trend continues, Ukraine is doomed to high inflation due to 
a chronic shortage of goods and to a continued decline in the 
gross domestic product (because of the reduced capacity of the 
domestic market). 
  At the same time, it should be noted that certain structural 
changes are taking place, even though these changes are not yet 
positive. The greatest structural changes are occurring in 
branches that export most of their products and services and in 
branches that are geared towards internal Ukrainian consumption. 
Those in the first category quite naturally enjoy greater 
opportunities and strive to make the most of them. There is 
almost no production decline in these branches (primarily oil 
refining, metallurgy, the chemical industry, shipbuilding, and 
sea, aviation, and motor vehicle transport), and they pay the 
highest wages. However, so far, this trend is not promoting 
economic stabilization, because there is no return of income 
from exports. In fact, capital is being exported at the same 
time that there is an acute shortage of domestic investments. 
Only if the recovery of funds from exports is ensured (by 
increasing or at least maintaining the present levels of 
exports) will these structural changes promote stabilization of 
both finances and domestic production as a whole. If this does 
not happen, the domestic market will soon become so denuded that 
virtually all branches involving investment or consumer 
specialization will come to a halt. 
  A second, rather significant structural change stems from 
the 
process of a partial reorientation on the part of exporters away 
from the east and towards the west. This has happened, 
primarily, because of a reduced demand among Russian buyers (as 
a result of the same kind of crisis as ours and the beginning of 
a structural reorganization of the Russian economy, and its 
demilitarization in particular), and, secondly, because of the 
growing attraction of selling in countries with a stable and 
convertible currency and stable and predictable sociopolitical 
conditions. The consequences of this reorientation must not be 
assessed one-sidedly. From the standpoint of current benefits 
and conditions of domestic economic stabilization, this 
reorientation must be regarded as positive, but in terms of the 
long-range interests of Ukrainian enterprises, such excessive 
turning to new markets can lead to negative consequences because 
of territorial remoteness, an already satisfied demand, or 
smaller arket capacities in other regions. 
  The third and most important structural change is taking 
place along the line that divides the dynamics of output volumes 
in the state and private sectors of the national economy. As we 
know, the former is experiencing an absolute decrease, while the 
latter is experiencing an absolute increase. This might lead one 
to conclude that the revival of the national economy can only be 
achieved through the efforts of the new, nonstate enterprises. 
But this conclusion is premature. Today's private sector is made 
up primarily of nonindustrial capital, and growth in this sector 
does not result in the overall improvement of the economy and a 
rise in personal incomes. Only after financial stabilization is 
achieved will the ctive investment of private capital in 
industry, agriculture, and the building industry become 
possible. If inflation is not curbed, the outstripping growth of 
turnover in the private sector and the increasingly higher 
income levels of employees in private enterprises will create an 
ever widening gap between people employed in the private sector 
and the incomes of those working at state enterprises. This is a 
detonator for future social disaffection. Moreover, the 
structural reorganization of the economy solely on the new 
private sector is possible only if a large number of state-owned 
enterprises proclaim bankruptcy. On the one hand, this would 
cause huge economic losses, and on the other hand, it would 
prolong the period of transformation by many decades. Neither 
society nor the state would survive this. 
  From a long-range standpoint, the current crisis is also 
dangerous in that it threatens to worsen the quality of manpower 
resources by greatly reducing financing of the humanitarian 
fields -- education, health care, culture, science, and 
environmental protection. The objective conditions causing this 
decrease in financing (reduced budget revenues due to a drop in 
profitability of enterprises and in personal incomes) is 
multiplied by subjective factors (an ineffective taxation 
system, the distribution of budget funds to benefit other 
sectors, discrimination of the nonstate humanitarian sector, 
etc.). 
  If the future brings with it a deficit of skills, morality, 
and professionalism, it will be more difficult to revive and 
rearm the economy and enable it to become more competitive. 
<H5>  A Look into the Near Future </H5>
  The disastrous hyperinflationary background and the falling 
living standard in Ukraine are hindering forces capable of 
halting the production decline. As a result, the ruination of 
the economy will continue and the point at which a reversal of 
the crisis can occur will become increasingly lower. This will 
last as long as the described destructive processes are not 
overcome. 
  Taking into account what has been said above, we should 
examine the opportunities that will emerge in 1994. The 
country's main tasks are to reduce the budget deficit and to end 
unproductive state spending and financing of losses and 
mismanagement. In addition, one of the most urgent goals is to 
expand exports and increase hard currency earnings. 
  Unfortunately, the plan and budget documents of the 
Kravchuk-Zvyahilskyy government put in doubt the prospects for a 
successful accomplishment of the listed tasks. We can assume 
that the budget deficit in the first half of 1994 will be higher 
than in the first half of 1993 and ill amount to 35-40% of 
total expenditures. This assumption is based on the fact that 
budget revenues will decrease due to tax increases, as well as 
due to declining production volume and profitability. 
  The acting government's regulation for the administrative 
confiscation from enterprises of their foreign currency earnings 
at an artificially low rate of exchange will further weaken 
Ukraine's export potential. This will substantially reduce the 
volume of raw materials and goods bought from Russia and 
increase the trade balance deficit with Russia to approximately 
three billion dollars. 
  The administrative confiscation of foreign currency, along 
with artificial bureaucratic restrictions (licensing, higher 
tariffs) on imports, will force the holders of foreign currency 
to evade bringing these funds back to Ukraine. Obviously, the 
amount kept out of the country will grow by another two to three 
billion dollars. This will lower the exchange rate of the 
karbovanets even further: in a half year's time it will fall to 
180,000-190,000 karbovantsi to the U.S. dollar. 
  One can therefore conclude that in the next few months of 
1994, the rate of inflation will not fall below the 65% 
mark 
per month. This will prevent the emergence of conditions 
conducive to technological modernization and to positive 
structural changes. 
  Now should we expect the current Cabinet of Ministers to 
make 
any large-scale attempts to introduce new organizational forms 
of managing enterprises, including privatization. Given these 
conditions, the rate of production decline cannot be slowed in 
1994. It can be stated with certainty that during the first six 
months of this year, the decline of the gross domestic product 
will remain at 15-20%. 
  Inflation will take the form of continually repeated -- 
every 
two to three months -- one-time administrative prices increases 
by 300-400% each time. At the same time, we should expect 
an 
increase in emissions by the National Bank, which in the first 
half of 1994 will cumulatively increase nearly tenfold. This 
situation will further destabilize the system of payments and 
settlement of accounts between enterprises. In light of an even 
greater drop in production, many enterprises will be forced to 
shut down. In the first half of 1994 alone, these closures will 
make mass unemployment a reality. Workers will be deprived of 
the opportunity to receive even a minimum wage. We can also 
expect an increase in emigration. 
  The further disparity between the rise in the prices of 
goods 
and services and increases in wages, pensions, and financial aid 
will substantially lower the living standard of the people. 
There will be an especially sharp drop in the real incomes of 
those who are paid from the budget and the pension fund, because 
contributions to these will decrease. The level of financing of 
defense, the state administration, and institutions in the 
social sphere will drop. If we do not manage to halt these 
processes in the second half of 1994, the very statehood of 
Ukraine will be threatened.

1994 "On Urgent Measures To Overcome the Payments Crisis and 
Normalize the Work of Enterprises," signed by acting Prime 
Minister Y. Zvyahilskyy and Minister I. Dotsenko] 
  [Text] In view of the current socioeconomic difficulties 
and of the need for urgent measures to overcome hyperinflation 
in Ukraine, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers hereby decrees 
that: 
  1. The Ministry of Finance and Ministry of the Economy will 
work with the Ministry of Justice and other concerned ministries 
and departments on the preparation of the following draft 
decisions of the Ukrainian Supreme Council and submit them to 
the Government of Ukraine within a month: 
  on the institution of a profit tax on 1 June 1995 instead of 
the tax on the income of enterprises and organizations and the 
introduction of a property tax for enterprises; 
  on the reduction of the value-added tax rate to 20 percent 
of 
the taxable turnover as of 1 July this year and on the possible 
reduction of this tax on domestically produced food staples and 
children's goods as of 1 January 1995; 
  on the institution of excise taxes of 80 percent on hard 
liquor, 10 percent on table wines, 40 percent on filtered 
tobacco products, 25 percent on unfiltered tobacco products, and 
10 percent on color television sets as of 1 July this year and 
the cancellation of the excise tax on black and white television 
sets and alcohol exported in accordance with international 
agreements of Ukraine; 
  on the establishment of a state monopoly in the production, 
storage, and wholesale and retail sales of hard liquor and 
tobacco products (in conjunction with the State Committee on the 
Food Industry). 
  2. The Ministry of the Economy, Ministry of External 
Economic 
Relations, State Customs Committee, Ministry of Finance, and 
Main State Tax Inspectorate will prepare a draft decree of the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council "On the Procedure for Conducting 
Barter (Commodity Exchange) Operations in Foreign Economic 
Activity" and submit it to the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers 
within two weeks for the purpose of stimulating exports of goods 
for foreign currency. 
  3. This must be done with consideration for the fact that 
draft edicts on the improvement of currency regulation and the 
liberalization of foreign economic operations have been 
submitted to the president of Ukraine and that a decree of the 
Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers on changes in import duties on 
certain goods has been passed in order to protect domestic 
producers of goods produced in sufficient quantities in the 
country. 
  4. The Ministry of the Economy will work with the Ministry 
of 
Finance and sectorial ministries and departments to determine 
the amounts of financial and credit support required by 
enterprises producing goods in demand in the domestic and 
foreign market and enterprises and organizations with a 
potential significant impact on the state of the national 
economy. 
  The Ministry of Finance and Ministry of the Economy will 
work 
with the National Bank to determine the sources of financial and 
credit support for various enterprises and the terms of its 
provision and use after of 1 June this year. 
  5. The National Bank is advised to consider lowering 
interest 
rates with a view to actual rates of inflation.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Chernyak: "Finances: National Economy </F>
in the Throes of Foreign Debt"] 
  [Text] Sharp discussions in Ukraine have recently 
focused on currency control, particularly currency policy and 
disposition of income. Primary concerns deal with the rational 
use of a fixed currency exchange rate. 
  In an inflationary situation a fixed rate of currency 
exchange rapidly loses meaning, especially when inflation is 
prolonged. The results are an increase in imports and a decrease 
in exports, the need to support the currency abroad, and 
transformation of Ukraine into a supplier of capital for other 
countries, especially Russia. In fact, Russia regards a fixed 
rate of exchange in Ukraine as a source of income in their 
economic plans for 1994. 
  The IMF calculated that in 1993 Ukraine lost 1.3 billion 
U.S. 
dollars because of state of affairs. 
  The negative balance of payment is destroying Ukrainian 
potential as an exporter and further exacerbates Ukrainian 
foreign debt, which in 1993 reached 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. 
This spells total economic ruin. 
  The obvious solution is to institute a market-controlled 
floating exchange rate for the karbovanets vis-a-vis the U.S. 
dollar and the ruble. Many experts agree on this course of 
action, including the IMF and V. Yushchenko, head of the 
Ukrainian National Bank (UNB). With certain economic 
adjustments, this approach makes sense theoretically and 
conceptually. 
  The best alternative for Ukraine at present is a controlled 
exchange rate, i.e., a free-floating rate during a transitional 
period until Ukraine develops a stable monetary system to 
support all financial transactions. 
  An absolute prerequisite for a floating exchange rate is the 
creation of a stabilizing fund to control the supply and demand 
for currency and alleviate the loss of millions of dollars at 
the UNB used to cover billions in foreign debts. 
  How did Russia manage to introduce a floating rate of 
exchange without a stabilizing fund? For one thing, Russia has a 
positive balance of trade thanks to its exports of fuel, raw 
products and armanents, all of which raises the value of the 
ruble with respect to the coupon-karbovanets. For another, 
unlike Ukraine, Russia can also intervene in the monetary 
market, while the contrived high ruble-to-karbovanets ratio 
assures a positive balance of trade with Ukraine by charging a 
lot for goods exported to Ukraine and paying little for goods 
imported from Ukraine. This is neocolonialism in the finest 
sense of the word and makes it possible for Russia to agree to a 
disproportionately low ruble-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate. 
  The UNB advocates a 100 percent mandatory regulation of 
currency in relation to market conditions, based on the 
theoretical arguments that this will ensure a more realistic and 
accurate exchange rate. 
  While theoretically true, such a course may screen subsidies 
at the UNB unless mandatory--but liberal--taxation is introduced 
to stimulate exports and increase flow of capital into the 
country. The current national deficit is due precisely to the 
lack of such taxes. 
  Money for the national monetary fund would come from taxes 
on 
exports, the selling of exported goods at the prevalent global 
prices, and recovery of export subsidies. 
  The Ukrainian foreign debt is an artificial creation of the 
accord signed between Ukraine and Russia in Moscow in October 
1992. In it, Ukraine assumed responsibility for the debts of its 
industry, while Russia did incur an analogous obligation for its 
industry. Furthermore, Ukraine agreed to sell its goods at below 
market value and to charge virtually nothing for the transit of 
Russian goods and those of other CIS countries across Ukrainian 
territory. Finally, Ukraine agreed to ineffective import-export, 
tariff, and monetary policies which make our products 
uncompetitive on the CIS market. Consequently, without drastic 
reforms in our foreign trade policies it will be impossible to 
eliminate Ukraine's foreign debt.

<F P=106> [Edict No 197/94 of President L. Kravchuk of Ukraine "On </F>
Measures To Decrease Currency in Circulation," signed by 
President Kravchuk in Kiev on 29 April 1994] 
  [Text] For the purpose of normalizing monetary circulation 
and reducing the rate of increase in the amount of money put 
into circulation, I hereby decree that: 
  1. All juridical persons within the territory of Ukraine, 
irrespective of property status and type of activity, and 
physical persons--citizens of Ukraine, foreign citizens, and 
stateless individuals--participating in business activity will 
do the following: 
  --make separate settlements with one another for goods, 
work, 
services, and securities costing more than six times the minimum 
wage only in non-cash forms. The amount of money issued by banks 
within a calendar month to enterprises, institutions, and 
organizations with up to 3,000 employees for current expenses 
will not exceed 15 times the minimum wage, or 30 times the 
minimum wage in the case of those with over 3,000 employees. 
Currency for business-related travel expenses will not be 
included among current expenses and will be issued by the banks 
according to the established procedure; 
  --keep currency in their cash funds within the established 
limits. The procedure for setting limits on the amount of cash 
on hand and for organizing the oversight of their observance 
will be defined by the National Bank of Ukraine; 
  --keep currency in excess of established limits in their 
cash 
funds only for the payment of wages, social insurance benefits, 
stipends, and pensions and only for a period of no more than 
three working days, including the date of receipt of the 
currency in banking establishments. 
  The second paragraph of this section will not apply to the 
settlements of collective agricultural enterprises and farmers 
with trade organizations and enterprises. 
  The provisions of the third and fourth paragraphs of this 
section will not apply to physical persons engaged in business 
activity. 
  2. The limits on the amount of currency kept in cash funds 
for juridical persons will be decided by the commercial banks 
serving them on the basis of financial reports submitted by 
these juridical persons. In the absence of these reports, the 
limits will be set autonomously by the commercial banks. 
  Commercial banks will issue currency only on valid grounds 
and will oversee the use of this currency for the designated 
purpose. 
  3. Juridical and physical persons engaged in the purchase of 
agricultural products, wild fruits and berries, medicinal herbs, 
waste paper, rags, glass, and scrap metal from the population 
and juridical persons conducting pawning operations will receive 
currency for the full amount of settlements with the population. 
  Motor transport enterprises and organizations (enterprises 
and organizations specializing in the performance of transport 
services) offering inter-oblast transport services will receive 
currency to cover the cost of fuel to be purchased outside the 
oblasts where these enterprises and organizations are located. 
  Expenditures of funds advanced for the purchase of products 
(or to cover the cost of fuel) will be overseen by commercial 
banks. 
  The amounts owed to citizens for the products they sell may 
be deposited in savings accounts only at the request of the 
citizens. 
  4. Banking establishments will issue funds to juridical 
persons conducting insurance operations for the payment of 
insured amounts (the coverage of claims) connected with 
voluntary and compulsory insurance contracts in non-cash forms, 
with the exception of the following: 
  amounts subject to payment in cash to citizens after the 
expiration of insurance contracts or their early termination; 
  compensatory payments to citizens in the form of insured 
amounts and claims. 
  5. Enterprises, institutions, and organizations, including 
trade organizations engaging in regular currency trading 
operations and relying on them for the payment of wages and 
pensions and the purchase of agricultural products will be 
entitled to keep currency over and above expenditure limits in 
their cash funds only for three working days prior to the 
payment date. 
  6. The observance of the requirements of this edict by 
juridical persons, with the exception of commercial banks, and 
physical persons engaged in business activity will be overseen 
by commercial banks, agencies of the Ukrainian State Tax 
Service, the State Auditing Service, and the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs. 
  The observance of the requirements of this edict by 
commercial banks will be overseen by institutions of the 
National Bank of Ukraine. 
  7. Sales of non-food items to citizens by trade 
organizations 
and other enterprises and organizations, as well as settlements 
with physical persons acting as the agents for goods sold on 
commission or consignment (per unit or lot, irrespective of the 
type and category of commodity) at a cost exceeding 200 times 
the minimum wage will be conducted with the use of Ukrainian 
bank checks or transfers to personal accounts. 
  No service fees will be charged on bank checks issued to 
citizens and on transfers to their personal accounts in excess 
of 200 times the minimum wage. 
  8. State tax inspectors will impose financial penalties on 
enterprises, institutions, and organizations, irrespective of 
property status and type of activity, and physical persons 
engaged in business activity for violations of the requirements 
of this edict, in the form of fines in the amount of the 
settlement operations or currency in cash funds exceeding the 
limit, on the basis of the information of their own audits and 
information submitted by commercial banks, the State Auditing 
Service, and agencies of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal 
Affairs and the National Bank of Ukraine. 
  The parties liable for violations of the requirements of the 
second paragraph of Section 1 of this edict in reference to the 
separate settlements will be the juridical and physical persons 
making the payments in cash. 
  Commercial banks violating the requirements of this edict 
will be subject to financial penalties, on the recommendation of 
the National Bank of Ukraine, in the form of fines of the 
following types: 
  for the failure to set limits on currency in cash funds--a 
fine equivalent to 50 times the minimum wage for each incident; 
  for the issuance of currency without valid grounds--a fine 
in 
the amount of the sums issued. 
  The fines stipulated in this section will be collected 
without recourse and deposited in the state budget. 
  The procedure for implementing the provisions of this edict 
will be defined by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers in 
conjunction with the National Bank of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Chetverik: "Currency Exchange Rates and </F>
Ukrainian Exports"] 
  [Text] A paradoxical situation has taken shape in Ukraine 
with regard to currency exchange rates. At this time there are 
actually three different rates--the fixed rate, the market rate, 
and the rate resulting from the relationship of world prices to 
the domestic prices of goods, which is different for each 
producer. The potential impact of this situation on Ukrainian 
exports is everyone's concern. 
  An agency of the Ukrainian Ministry of External Economic 
Relations assessed the export potential of the main types of 
industrial commodities in 1994. Table 1 illustrates the results.

main 
commodities 


  It is clear that the products of the metallurgical complex 
will continue to bring in the most foreign currency. Besides 
this, there will also be some emphasis on machine building. They 
should account for most of the receipts. Nevertheless, there is 
some indication of wishful thinking here. Profitability, after 
all, is one of the essential conditions of exports, and no one 
must ever forget that enterprises have to sell 50 percent of 
their foreign currency receipts to the state at the fixed rate. 
This puts producers in vastly different positions, because the 
production costs of all of these commodities are different, but 
the 50 percent of the foreign currency receipts remaining at the 
disposal of the enterprises must cover all of the expenses of 
reproduction and produce a certain amount of profit as well. 
Obviously, if these conditions are not met, the export of the 
commodity becomes unprofitable. This means that exports of some 
of the commodities listed in Table 1 or exports as a whole might 
be reduced considerably or be discontinued. The reader can judge 
the validity of this statement for himself. The figures in Table 
1 and the results of simple computations, presented in Table 2, 
illustrate the current situation quite clearly.

43,000 krb = $1 


  We should stipulate from the very start that any price set 
by 
a producer in karbovantsy will include a certain profit margin 
and all overhead expenses, including the cost of using obsolete 
equipment and inefficient production technology. 
  An analysis of the figures in Table 2 suggests the 
following: 
  1. Goods cannot be exported at prices set with consideration 
for the fixed exchange rate of the dollar, because these prices 
would be much higher than world prices. In other words, the 
fixed rate and inflationary processes distort actual enterprise 
expenses by exaggerating them. It is also impossible, however, 
to export a commodity at a price set with consideration for the 
market exchange rate of the dollar, because this would be much 
lower than the world price and consequently would be a dumping 
price. 
  2. The undifferentiated approach to enterprises in different 
industries which export their products and sell 50 percent of 
their foreign currency receipts at the fixed rate will reduce 
exports of the products of the metallurgical complex because the 
income the enterprises earn will not cover their production 
costs at the present market exchange rate of the dollar. Exports 
of products of the chemical industry, on the other hand, 
probably will increase even under the conditions of the 
compulsory sale of 50 percent of the foreign currency receipts 
at the fixed rate. This is due to the high world prices, the 
fairly low production expenses of producers, and the high market 
exchange rate of the foreign currency. 
  3. In view of the fact that the projected export figures for 
the metallurgical complex are much higher than the projections 
of other industries, we can assume that enterprises of the 
metallurgical complex play a cardinal role in the determination 
of the market exchange rate. This means that unless the fixed 
rate is adjusted and the requirement for the compulsory sale of 
50 percent of foreign currency receipts at this rate is 
cancelled, enterprises of the metallurgical complex will have an 
incentive to increase the market value of the dollar and will 
strive to do this, because this will give them a chance (their 
only chance) to cover their own expenses, earn a good income, 
and increase their output. 
  Finally, if the National Bank could start buying foreign 
currency at the effective enterprise or industry rate, this 
would benefit the producers and the state. Furthermore, this 
probably would aid in stabilizing the exchange rate of the 
Ukrainian karbovanets.

<F P=106> [Interview with Volodymyr Pylypchuk, people's deputy of </F>
Ukraine, by Serhiy Lavrenyuk; place and date not given: "We Have 
Laws a Program and a Mechanism for Implementation' " -- first 
paragraph is HOLOS UKRAYINY introduction] 
  [Text] Recently a group of economists, headed by People's 
Deputy Volodymyr Pylypchuk, finished working on a program to 
overcome the economic crisis. In addition to the program, the 
group prepared nearly 50 legislative acts, 30 of which are 
drafts of laws. Today, Volodymyr Pylypchuk discusses some 
provisions of the program. 
  [Lavrenyuk] Volodymyr Mefodiyovych, a wise man once said 
that 
if a cripple knows the right route, he will reach his 
destination faster than a rider on horseback jumping around 
aimlessly. Applying this image to define how our economy has 
been managed for the last few years, one is unfortunately forced 
to assert that its progress has been that of a cripple wandering 
aimlessly. Let me therefore ask you: do you and the team with 
whom you drafted this program for overcoming the crisis think of 
yourselves as horsemen who know the way? 
  [Pylypchuk] We are not proposing anything new, because all 
postcommunist states have chosen to make the transition to the 
market. How to go about making this transition, the various 
elements in this process, and the sequence in which the 
different steps are taken -- that is a different matter. For 
example, this transition would have been much easier in 1990, 
whereas the situation today requires the use of more complicated 
methods. On the other hand, there are many more people today 
than in 1990 who know how to go about making this transition. We 
have more than just a program. To make it work, it is necessary 
to make changes in our legislation, and we have worked these 
out. The only thing left to do is to refine the implementation 
mechanisms and the sanctions to be applied for failing to obey 
the laws. 
  [Lavrenyuk] In your opinion, how soon will the Supreme 
Council get through its organizational phase and get around to 
the economy? 
  [Pylypchuk] I expect the new Supreme Council to complete its 
internal organization in a week or two. 
  [Lavrenyuk] Then let me put the question another way. 
Volodymyr Mefodiyovych, how soon will the Supreme Council begin 
to discuss the state budget? We all recall that at one time 
Finance Minister Pyatachenko vowed to eliminate the deficit. 
Naturally, no one believed that this would be done, but the 
deputies had to approve this budget because they had no way out. 
To be sure, a separate provision in the decree provided for a 
quarterly review. But we are approaching the middle of the 
second quarter, and there is no indication that anyone is 
planning to review the budget, just as everyone expected from 
the beginning. Meanwhile, experts predict that the deficit will 
reach 35-40 percent in the first half of 1994. 
  [Pylypchuk] The thing is that the promises of this 
government 
are not serious, and so it is not worth getting fixated on them. 
Indeed, when the budget was being adopted, many deputies, 
including myself, asked the finance minister if, given the 
current program, the current budget, and the existing taxation 
system, the government could halt inflation. He answered that it 
could. And so we have a situation in which we collect only 
200-250 billion of every trillion karbovantsi due in taxes. 
  [Lavrenyuk] Apropos of taxes. Tell me, do you still support 
the idea of a sales tax? 
  [Pylypchuk] We have modified this somewhat. This will be a 
tax on purchases (the person who buys will pay). 
  [Lavrenyuk] In that case, what do you think of the decree 
that the Cabinet of Ministers has just passed, which stipulates 
that in a month's time drafts of decisions are to be drawn up 
regarding replacing the tax on income with a tax on profits, 
establishing a property tax, and lowering the value-added tax to 
20 percent? 
  [Pylypchuk] It is true that any reduction in taxes will 
eventually produce an increase in revenues into the budget, 
because the tax burden on the producer will be lessened. As to a 
tax on profits, we've already had that. I think, therefore, that 
in view of the inflation we have, it is absurd and senseless to 
view profit as a target of taxation, because with each upward 
spiral of inflation, profits are reduced to zero, which leads to 
price increases and a greater budget deficit. It is impossible 
to mend the budget if there is no solid compensatory tax base. 
Only those aspects that are connected with the price can serve 
as this base. All normal economists know this. Whereas it does 
not take a great deal of intelligence to insist on imposing a 
tax on profits, because this is a traditional tax in a stable 
economy. To impose a property tax at this time means to halt 
privatization, because only those who own property will pay it. 
(Just imagine a tax on a privatized apartment.) 
  This, in turn, is linked to the problem of regional 
unemployment. We will be able to solve this problem without cost 
to the budget only if we have a full-fledged housing market. In 
other words, it is possible to introduce such a tax, but only 
when all citizens are private owners. This is but further proof 
that there are many dilettantes in the current government, who 
have heard something somewhere, but do not know when that 
"something" should be implemented. 
  [Lavrenyuk] Now that you have mentioned privatization, can 
you describe the changes that you propose in your program for 
overcoming the crisis. 
  [Pylypchuk] We are proposing to broaden the opportunities 
available to the public with respect to privatization. In 
addition, in the course of privatization, it is possible to 
solve the problem of paying back what the Ukrainian state owes 
its citizens (for the devaluation of their savings, bonds, 
special drawings). In conjunction with this, we propose indexing 
personal savings: up to 1,500 -- 10,000-fold, up to 10,000 -- 
5,000-fold, from 10,000 to 20,000 -- 1,000-fold, and over 20,000 
-- 500-fold. And to issue these funds to citizens in the form of 
privatization vouchers. We also think that it is important to 
step up privatization, which can be done by computerizing these 
processes, because we will gain more from accelerating 
privatization than from the fiscal function of privatization. In 
addition, we have worked out a simplified mechanism for making 
enterprises sound. This can be done in three stages: the first 
involves changing the management, the second -- reorganizing the 
enterprise, and the third -- changing the owner. If a monopoly 
enterprise shuts down, the management is changed, and, if the 
manufacturing process allows for this, production is broken up, 
new enterprises are created, which are immediately corporated 
and their stocks put on the market. If an enterprise with a 
debit balance shuts down, its management is changed and the 
enterprise is privatized without being corporated, for example. 
In other words, we propose harsh measures. 
  [Lavrenyuk] Could we talk about the mechanism for overcoming 
inflation? 
  [Pylypchuk] We have already mentioned the taxation system as 
one element in liquidating the budget deficit, but we propose 
another measure as well -- commercializing budget funds. On the 
whole, to put it briefly, this mechanism provides for 
eliminating the budget deficit, halting the decline in 
production, liquidating the foreign trade deficit, balancing the 
goods and money supplies, and liquidating the issuance of more 
credit than there are resources. The point also needs to be made 
when speaking of the drop in production, for example, that the 
policy of the National Bank of Ukraine [NBU] "contributed" to 
this in no small way. Of what use is simply prohibiting not to 
issue credit? [as published] One could conclude from this that 
the NBU's policy is based on a simplistic understanding of 
regulating the economy by monetary means: first they issued too 
much money, causing it to be devalued, then they suddenly "came 
to their senses" and swung to the other extreme. Too little 
money in circulation causes production volumes to drop. In this 
respect, the NBU's actions remind me of a drunk weaving from 
fence to fence as he makes his way home from the bar. 
  [Lavrenyuk] Then what about currency regulation and the 
external trade activities of enterprises that are affected by 
this? 
  [Pylypchuk] There are two points at which currency 
regulation 
has the same effect (I should state at the outset that currency 
regulation as such is a necessary thing) -- when either zero 
percent or one hundred percent of foreign currency has to be 
sold. The least effective situation is when fifty percent of 
the foreign currency has to be sold. Very harsh administrative 
measures are required to ensure that one hundred percent of 
foreign currency is sold. On the other hand, the second method 
(zero sales of foreign currency) means abandoning any attempt to 
manage and giving up the state's monopoly over exports. 
Enterprises will then be interested in hard currency earnings, 
but to ensure that these earnings benefit our state rather than 
some foreign country, we need to provide incentives not only for 
our own depositors but also foreigners by raising the interest 
rate on deposits to 25 percent. In these conditions, our own 
hard currency earnings will be recovered, and foreign investors 
will try to invest their money where they will earn larger 
profits. 
  [Lavrenyuk] In connection with this, what do you think of 
the 
current round in the epic tale of the commodities bonds, which 
were blocked nearly a year ago thanks to your committee, and 
which have now been resurrected following some osmetic changes? 
  [Pylypchuk] There is one thing I fail to understand in this 
situation: why are we so unwilling to do things in the normal 
way? Let me remind you of what happened: they issued commodities 
bonds and placed them somewhere in the West at seven percent per 
annum. But, first of all, there is no interest on commodities 
bonds anywhere in the orld, and, second, if we do not repay the 
money, in 10-20 years we have to settle the bill with property. 
But whose property? The property of state enterprises? But in 
ten years' time privatization should be completed. Will we then 
pay with property belonging to our citizens? If so, we have to 
ask our citizens if they are willing to be saddled with this 
debt. But let us imagine that there is still state property ten 
years from now. We hand it over, the investor introduces new 
technologies, and begins production. What is the sense of all 
this? Do we need investments right now? Yes! Then let us at 
least sell our unfinished construction projects for hard 
currency by international tender. We will have the money today 
and, moreover, we will not be burdened by the need to pay 
interest. And if an investor comes today, he will also set up 
the manufacturing process and begin production today rather than 
ten years from now. 
  That is what we proposed doing originally, and that is what 
we are proposing again today. But we are witnessing another 
attempt to get around this, which compels me to think that 
behind this maneuver lie the personal economic interests of 
those organizing and pushing this through. 
  [Lavrenyuk] In conclusion, Volodymyr Mefodiyovych, what 
would 
you like to wish the new Supreme Council? How do you envisage 
its work? 
  [Pylypchuk] I believe that it will be more constructive than 
that of the former council. I say this because while working 
during the preparatory period with deputies who are economists 
by profession, I saw that the position of the representatives of 
the so-called left bloc is the same as that of the Polish 
leftists -- that is, they support reforms. I like them. I do not 
know whether all the leftists hold the same view, but we already 
share a common fulcrum. Naturally, I would like the deputies to 
the Supreme Council to take into account both the positive and 
negative experience of their predecessors. For our part, we 
worked out a new organizational structure for the Supreme 
Council -- we changed the basis on which commissions are to be 
formed. Previously, they were formed to correspond to the 
branches of the national economy, while we propose creating 
commissions that are based on the branches of the economy and 
the law. In other words, there will be separate commissions on 
budget issues, banking, property reforms, micro and 
macroeconomics, and others, because the previous Supreme Council 
had several economic commissions, but while ours drafted 160 
laws, some of the others prepared only three or four each. This 
may have been enjoyable [for our commission], but it was also 
exhausting. The load has to be evenly distributed. As to the new 
Supreme Council, I wish it to complete organizing its working 
bodies as quickly as possible and get down to the real work that 
needs to be done. 
  [Lavrenyuk] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Ekhanurov, Ukrainian deputy minister of </F>
economy: "The Future Belongs to Multinational Companies"] 
  [Text] Yuriy Ekhanurov, Ukrainian deputy minister of 
economy and president of the Small Enterprise Union in weighing 
problems concerning the creation of a CIS unified economic space 
and the place of our country in it, believes that the future 
belongs to multinational companies. 
  There have already been many declarations. One of them 
concerns creation of an economic union of commonwealth 
countries, which as is commonly known, Ukraine joined as an 
associate member. A lot here is big politics. Economic reality, 
however, stubbornly injects its corrections in such agreements 
and treaties. It is necessary to take that into account. 
  When I hear appeals by industrialists (particularly from the 
eastern regions) heard from tribunes at conferences and 
congresses for the immediate restoration of old ties with former 
cooperative partners, which for some reason are often linked 
with various forms of protests against active privatization of 
state property, I involuntarily feel surprised by the naivete 
and the feigned lack of insight by these mature leaders of large 
industries. 
  The economic river is fast-flowing and variable. How is it 
possible to seek links with something that no longer exists with 
such recklessness? First of all I have in mind the new economy 
of our main economic partner, Russia, which is completely 
different from what it was yesterday. Totally different 
relations, frequently not controlled by decisions at the state, 
and certainly, at the interstate level, predominate there. The 
new property owner is already functioning in Russia and becoming 
more active, a prototype of whom is barely evident in Ukraine. 
  Still we must hold on to former markets at whatever cost, 
inasmuch as we will hardly be able to get a foothold in the next 
several years on the new European market with our products, 
which lack high quality and competitive ability. It is necessary 
to seek ties with Russians, Belarusians, Kazakhs, and other CIS 
members, but on a qualitatively new basis. 
  Structural interrelations among subjects of management in 
Russia, for instance, as I have already said, are undergoing 
important changes. For instance, tens of industrial-financial 
groups are already operating there (whereas we are only talking 
about them). Therefore, the question concerning mutual 
penetration and amalgamation of capital and, correspondingly, 
efforts for attainment of some common goal, is increasingly 
becoming the order of the day. Mutual acquisition of "foreign" 
property is necessary and inevitable. 
  Again, because of the outstripping pace of their economic 
reforms, the Russians are today ready to sell shares in their 
enterprises and financial structures to foreign partners and 
purchase foreign shares. We, however, are not ready for this. 
Even though I feel confident that the future belongs to 
multinational companies. 
  Thus, whether we want to recognize it or not, there is 
simply 
no other way for us to engage in normal work and obtain the 
possibility of economic integration with the closest, and in the 
long range, with presently distant neighbors, other than to 
follow the path of immediate radical reforms and mandatory 
fulfillment of privatization programs and measures. 
  We have to create structures as quickly as possible that 
would be capable of conducting a policy aimed at assimilation 
and protection of markets (i.e. the amalgamation of efforts of 
industry and financial capital). It is necessary to develop the 
entire market infrastructure with insurance against risk, along 
with leasing, holding, and similar forms and organizations 
accepted in a market economy. 
  Before attempting to change something on the outside, 
however, it is necessary to create optimal conditions inside the 
country for the normal existence, development, and flourishing 
of domestic production. Its export possibilities must not be 
stifled with thoughtless laws and decrees, but stimulated in 
every way. It must be offered the opportunity to get up on its 
feet so as to be able to arouse interest in itself primarily 
among countrymen, and then among consumers abroad. 
  According to first quarter results 24 percent of our 
enterprises (read every fourth one) are unprofitable. Can they 
promise any dividends at all to potential owners of their 
potential shares? An absurd question. But it is already on the 
agenda in connection with the massive privatization that has 
started. 
  It might turn out that we will yet again fail the 
expectations of our people. That cannot be allowed to happen. 
The policy must be rigid, but honest and open. People must be 
told the truth. They must know that profits, and that means 
dividends, may be generated only by effective production. That 
is what it will be when an enterprising owner emerges on the 
economic arena.

<F P=106> Interview with Anatoliy Holubchenko, minister of industry of </F>
Ukraine, by Lyudmila Nikolaychuk; place and date not given: 
"Antidumping: The Suit Has Started, but Ukraine May Attempt To 
Influence It"] 
  [Text] The antidumping suits, which have recently 
been threatening Ukraine, augur many problems for our industry 
which, clearly, is already facing more than enough of them. Just 
what threat do the antidumping suits pose for the Ukrainian 
economy as a whole? Quite obviously those in the Ministry of 
Industry, with jurisdiction over most of the enterprises with an 
export potential, had to work out some projections dealing with 
these issues. What were those projections? Anatoliy Holubchenko, 
Ukrainian minister of industry, talks with a UNIAN correspondent 
about them. 
  [Nikolaychuk] Mr. Anatoliy, Ukraine's difficulties, as 
commonly known, started with the initiation of an antidumping 
suit by the International Arbitration Court against the 
metallurgical flagship Azovstal. How complicated is that 
situation? 
  [Holubchenko] The problem of dumping is increasingly acute 
for Ukraine. We have done too much "trading" in the years of 
unlimited freedom. The reason being the lack of a price 
regulation mechanism as well as three years of uncontrolled 
trade by our enterprises. Particularly in types of products that 
are in short supply, which are eagerly purchased, and also in 
raw materials. 
  Canada and the United States initiated antidumping 
litigation 
involving products that are supplied from Ukraine. Even though 
the products were not supplied directly by Azovstal or even by 
Ukraine, but by the Kleker firm, which simply acquired sheet 
steel from Azovstal and resold it in Canada and the United 
States. We are, however, a civilized country with a state 
economic sector. 
  Therefore complaints concerning those products, which come 
from Ukraine, are expressed directly to the government. 
  A special task force has now been formed, headed by my 
deputy 
Valeriy Mazur, which is working on the antidumping problem. 
  [Nikolaychuk] Beside the Azovstal suit, what other 
antidumping litigation was initiated against Ukraine? 
  [Holubchenko] The EC filed an antidumping suit against our 
government pertaining to ferro-alloys, certain types of mineral 
fertilizers, and cast iron. Today, for instance, Ukraine is 
selling cast iron at $95-$115 per tonne. Europe is maintaining a 
price of $140-$150. Naturally it cannot allow our cheap cast 
iron on its market since that would ruin its producers. 
Therefore, in protecting its producers, the EC initiated a suit 
against us. That, naturally does not mean the production of cast 
iron is that cheap in Ukraine. But because we have always 
maintained low prices for energy sources, the cost of cast iron 
production was artificially kept low. 
  [Nikolaychuk] Approximately how much and from whose treasury 
will the Ukrainian enterprises have to pay in case the suits are 
lost? According to certain data, for instance, Azovstal alone is 
being threatened with a fine of $1.5 million. 
  [Holubchenko] We are working on that right now and in my 
opinion, have every chance of avoiding payment of fines. Almost 
daily our experts participate in negotiations with EC experts 
and western firms. Naturally, we ask that consideration be given 
to the fact that Ukraine is a developing country and that the 
violation occurred due to our lack of experience and ignorance. 
  [Nikolaychuk] Please indicate whether the guilty enterprises 
will become bankrupt if Ukraine has to pay in case of the loss 
of antidumping lawsuits? 
  [Holubchenko] I do not believe so. But the point is not the 
fines. If we should lose the suits such heavy taxes will be 
imposed on the import of Ukrainian products that Ukrainian 
enterprises will be unable to appear on the market at all. For 
example, we are selling cast iron today at $105, while EC 
countries sell it for $150, and in case of a loss Ukraine will 
be compelled to sell cast iron in Europe at $200. No one would 
buy it. In other words we will lose the market. 
  [Nikolaychuk] Do the enterprises have adequate funds to pay 
the fine? 
  [Holubchenko] If they do not have them, they will have to be 
earned. They must build less and pay lower wages and even 
smaller pensions. In other words, it will be necessary to 
economize.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Alexandr Lebed by Viktor Perushkin; </F>
place and date not given: "`Russia Would Not Survive Another 
War'"] 
  [Text] The eighth round of negotiations between 
Russia and Moldova on the withdrawal of the Russian 14th Army 
contributed no appreciable changes. The presence of the Russian 
military in the Dniester region is, as before, exasperating the 
leadership of Moldova, whereas General Lebed, commander of the 
14th Army, continues to exasperate the leadership of the 
Dniester region. There has long been talk in the republic about 
the speedy posting of the army commander to a new assignment. 
All this was discussed in an interview given to our special 
correspondent Viktor Perushkin by General Aleksandr Lebed. 
  [Perushkin] Has it not become tedious for you being a 
general 
in an out-of-the-way place? You once studied with P. Grachev, 
after all, and together with him fought in Afghanistan and 
defended democracy in August 1991. Have you not been offered a 
general's position in the "Arbat Military District?" 
  [Lebed] There never have been and never will be such offers. 
I have never stooped and have never served either general 
secretaries or the president but have served, am now serving, 
and will continue to serve the Fatherland. My current 
appointment is entirely suitable for me personally. And in 
Moscow I might not blend in with the capital's generals. None of 
this is up to me, nor am I fit for the role of entourage man. I 
am used to being myself and walking alone. 
  [Perushkin] Aleksandr Ivanovich, a truce has held in the 
Dniester region for two years now. Is such a method of conflict 
settlement possible in Abkhazia, say? 
  [Lebed] In the Dniester region, as distinct from Abkhazia, 
the conflict was not of a national coloration. Moldovans, 
Russians, Ukrainians, and Bulgarians took part in the war on 
both sides. The similarity, however, is that in both places 
people fought and continue to fight for their rights, which, on 
a wave of pure nationalism, are being flouted in the most 
loutish fashion. It is sufficient to say that the cause of the 
conflict here was the Language Act. More than 30 percent of the 
Russian-speaking population living on the territory of the 
former Moldavia had to speak Romanian. 
  [Perushkin] But today, Chisinau maintains, Moldova's policy 
has changed for the better. How far does this correspond to 
reality? 
  [Lebed] At first sight, truly, common sense would appear to 
be starting to conquer. But all is not that simple. The result 
of the war in the Dniester region (and this was a real war) was 
a deep rift between Chisinau and Tiraspol. Only time can smooth 
over it, and trust will be restored very slowly. That 
commonsensical people have entered the parliament of Moldova is 
a first step toward this. 
  [Perushkin] So Moldova has taken it. The Dniester region? 
  [Lebed] The leadership of the Dniester region has expressed 
its readiness for negotiations, but in practice nothing has 
changed. Nonetheless, the visit of V. Vasev, authorized 
representative of the Russian president, whose purpose is the 
rapprochement of the positions of Moldova and the Dniester 
region, should, I believe, produce positive results in the very 
near future. Adopting a combat posture forever is impossible. 
Unless radical measures are adopted, no good will come of this. 
  [Perushkin] The truce that set in two years ago is linked 
with your arrival. Your appearance in Abkhazia, let us suppose, 
would produce a similar result. 
  [Lebed] Let us start with the fact that the 14th Army has 
been here since 1956. I was sent here at a time when the war was 
in full swing. I lay claim to no laurels in this situation. The 
sole thing I have understood in going through Afghanistan, 
Azerbaijan, and Armenia is that in all such situations tough 
measures need to be adopted instantly. This is a guarantee that 
blood will not be shed for any length of time. You can fight for 
two years and lose five to 10 persons a day. Not many, it might 
seem, but in a year the number of those who have perished 
amounts to 3,650. And this matter can be settled once and for 
all, with a loss of 100 men, with one brutal strike. I am a 
supporter of this policy here, in the Dniester region, also, and 
I have been able to prove its soundness. But it cannot be said 
that the same tactics are suitable in just any instance, 
including in Abkhazia. It is always necessary to proceed from 
the situation, but spinelessness in policy always has severe 
repercussions. 
  [Perushkin] Judging by your approach to conflict solution, 
you are a hard man. Is this actually the case or is it a 
defensive reaction? 
  [Lebed] I derive absolutely no pleasure from being forced to 
adopt harsh measures since I am one of those officers who has 
had in their life their fill of fighting--this is as far as it 
goes. It is simply essential to settle all political 
disagreements at the negotiating table, but there are moments 
when words are left hanging in the air. It is then that the 
moment for decisive actions comes. But this does not mean that I 
am a supporter of war. The point is that our state would not 
survive a third war in one century. We have lost a substantial 
part of our gene pool as it is, and if this continues, the 
nation will perish. 
  [Perushkin] It is a poor soldier that does not dream of 
becoming a general. You have become one. What next? 
  [Lebed] This saying continues. It is a poor soldier that, 
having become a general, stops being a soldier. I will say one 
thing: Several years ago the Afghan mujahidin would not have 
dared think even of attacking the USSR, today they are preying 
on its borders. Our state has become an ailing emaciated 
elephant that all kinds of rats and hyenas have begun to bite. 
The state has always been associated with a potent army. It is 
by no means necessary to wage war, but the presence of such an 
army is a guarantee of the security of the Fatherland. And as 
long as the world has existed and continues to exist, there has 
always been and will always be respect for the strong. I 
subsequently see it as my mission, therefore, to strengthen the 
Armed Forces in the interests of our state. I will look like a 
dumb cook praising his own broth, perhaps, but the best minds 
and the best workers will be bought or destroyed unless a 
professional army is created. 
  [Perushkin] Is this the explanation for your reluctance to 
play politics? 
  [Lebed] Absolutely right. I have never set myself the goal 
of 
ascending to some political heights. But today's situation in 
the Dniester region forces me to look into all matters. I cannot 
switch the points anywhere. There is a Russian Embassy, but it 
is in Chisinau. Of course, the ambassador and the consul are 
regularly in Tiraspol, but questions arise daily, and they have 
to be tackled. 
  [Perushkin] You have not developed a relationship with the 
leadership of the Dniester region. Who does not suit whom in 
this situation? 
  [Lebed] There is total reciprocity here. Perhaps internal 
matters should not concern me, but my army, which has to live, 
is in the republic. A great deal of matters arise in this 
connection, and this is, naturally, disliked. 
  [Perushkin] When will the question of the withdrawal of the 
14th Army be decided? 
  [Lebed] The point is that when an army of one state is on 
the 
territory of another, this is always bad. Should this army be 
withdrawn? Undoubtedly! But when this army is withdrawn will 
depend on the political and economic conditions for its 
withdrawal that have been created. At this stage these 
conditions have not been created. I do not, therefore, have an 
official decision on the withdrawal of the 14th Army. 
Consequently, the army will be here a while yet.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Afghanistan Is Opposed to Aggression </F>
and Condemns the Mercenaries"] 
  [Text] As already reported, in December 1993 Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan, president of the Republic of Armenia, sent 
letters to Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of the Islamic 
Republic of Afghanistan, and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, 
in which he expressed concern at the involvement of Afghan 
mujahidin in the Karabakh conflict in units of the Azerbaijani 
Army. 
  We were able to acquaint the reader with fragments of the 
return message of the president of Afghanistan. Today we have an 
opportunity to publish a more detailed text obtained from the 
staff of the president of the Republic of Armenia: 
  "Your Excellency, I have received and studied your message 
concerning the involvement of certain irresponsible Afghan 
persons participating in the war in Nagornyy Karabakh. The 
Afghan side recognizes the feelings of the Armenian leadership. 
I want with great regret to inform you and, through you, the 
people of Armenia that some groups of adventurers undermining 
social and political stability in Afghanistan are, truly, for 
financial backing for their aims accepting Afghan underlings of 
the former Soviet Azerbaijan in order to cause a deterioration 
in relations between Armenia and Afghanistan. 
  "Your Excellency! The Islamic state of Afghanistan and the 
freedom-loving people of Afghanistan, recognizing the UN 
Charter, express their protest against aggression, from wherever 
it emanate. 
  "We view the roots of the contradiction between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan as the consequences of a conspiracy of the former 
Soviet leaders. The Islamic state of Afghanistan and the people 
of Afghanistan advocate peaceful coexistence and are following a 
strategy of peace and Afghanistan's friendly relations with the 
two countries: Azerbaijan and Armenia. In the light of this we 
do not approve of the participation of Afghan citizens in the 
armed operations in Karabakh. We support a peaceful resolution 
of the conflict between the recently formed countries. 
  "Your Excellency! The participation of certain mercenaries 
going by the name of mujahidin cannot cause a deterioration in 
the friendly relations between Afghanistan and Armenia. The 
Afghan side will endeavor in every possible way to prevent this 
inhuman business, which is being conducted by extremists using 
their income from this to increase instability in Afghanistan. 
Afghanistan will try to put an end to this business as soon as 
possible. 
  "Your Excellency! Availing myself of the opportunity, I wish 
you and the people of Armenia success, good health, and 
happiness."

<F P=106> [Ashot Aznuni report: "The 'Human Face' and the 'Fists' of </F>
the Reforms"] 
  [Text] The economic situation in the republic underwent no 
appreciable changes in the past week, which cannot be said about 
its perception. I refer to a demonstration organized by the 
republic Confederation of Trade Unions on Friday, which was 
conducted to the accompaniment of socioeconomic slogans. There 
are, truly, limits to society's patience and understanding of 
the severe conditions under which the republic finds itself. The 
government must clearly recognize that hungry people are 
extremely unreceptive to reforms and that the efficient reform 
of society is possible only under the conditions of the 
assurance of minimum conditions for society's subsistence. The 
demonstration also showed that the unions are not entirely happy 
with their present relationship with the government. 
  The currency rates in the republic continue to be controlled 
with a "firm hand" by the Central Bank, and the prices of the 
basic consumer goods remain practically unchanged. A reduction 
in prices has been recorded even in respect to a number of 
commodity groups. True, the shortage of eggs had initially led 
to a doubling and tripling of their price: from 400 to 800-1,200 
drams. But a carton of eggs now costs 600-650 drams. The price 
of cucumbers, tomatoes, and strawberries--all that has already 
ripened and produced its first harvest--is gradually acquiring a 
"human face." 
  The situation in the energy sphere has remained practically 
unchanged (thank God!). The public is receiving its daily 
four-hour electricity "ration"--even more, should there be any 
surpluses. 
  Certain hopes are being linked with Fourth Armenian 
Businessmen's Forum Conference, which is taking place at this 
time in Yerevan and in which entrepreneurs from many countries 
are participating. The minimum result of the forum will be, I 
believe, the creation in our republic of a new international 
bank and an open stock company--the Armenian Businessmen's 
Corporation. 
  The final preparations for the start of privatization are 
being made. Last week the government confirmed the list of the 
first "small" facilities to be transferred to private ownership. 
In June, according to the president, the sales assistant will, 
finally, obtain his own set of scales, the tailor, a needle and 
scissors, and so forth. Privatization certificates--vouchers 
that should clearly identify each citizen of the republic's 
share of the former general property--will, finally, arrive in 
the republic this same month, the Ministry of Finance promises.

<F P=106> [Vagram Stepanyan report on briefing given by Babken </F>
Ararktsyan, chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of 
Armenia, on 30 May: "Difficult Summer: Six Weeks To Go Before 
the Start of the Parliamentary Recess"] 
  [Text] The start of summer is expected to be quite tense 
and strenuous for the Supreme Council of Armenia both in the 
sphere of the establishment of interparliamentary relations and 
in law-making activity itself, Babken Ararktsyan, chairman of 
the Supreme Council of the Republic of Armenia, promised at the 
start of his briefing on 30 May. Turning to the business of the 
current, eighth, session of parliament, he noted that in the 
upcoming six weeks of business the Supreme Council intended to 
discuss two most important matters: the Constitution of Armenia 
and the law on elections to the Supreme Council of the Republic 
of Armenia. He expressed the hope here that parliament would 
comprehensively consider and discuss all the drafts of the 
future basic law that had been presented. The speaker observed 
in this connection that such discussions afforded the 
opportunity for compromise and that, were difficulties to arise, 
a conciliation commission, which would study the versions of the 
draft constitution, would, most likely, be formed. Even if these 
discussions produce no results, they will at least have been of 
the nature of a useful debate. 
  Then, having noted a number of serious tasks geared to 
implementation of economic reforms in the republic that are to 
be accomplished in the course of the current session, Babken 
Ararktsyan familiarized the journalists in greater detail with 
the Supreme Council's upcoming work on the development of 
interparliamentary relations, detailing the planned visits and 
meetings. Specifically, a session of the CIS Interparliamentary 
Assembly Council will be held on 8 June in St. Petersburg. The 
12 items on the forum's agenda include also the question of a 
peaceful settlement of the Karabakh conflict, which will be 
presented by M. Shirimkulov, leader of the assembly's 
peacekeeping group and chairman of the parliament of Kyrgyzstan. 
As Mr. Ararktsyan announced, there has been a positive solution 
of the question of the participation of members of parliament of 
the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in the discussion of this 
question, which is in keeping with the letter and spirit of the 
Bishkek Protocol. He noted also that it is thanks to such forums 
that the question of a settlement of the Karabakh conflict has 
acquired a qualitatively new path of solution. 
  At the end of the assembly session the chairman of the 
Supreme Council of Armenia will at the invitation of Ivan 
Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma of Russia, leave for an 
official visit to Moscow. In the course of the visit it is 
planned to sign an agreement on interparliamentary cooperation 
and also a number of other important documents. The next plenary 
session of the parliamentary assembly of the participants in 
Black Sea Economic Cooperation will take place 20-22 June in 
Bucharest, and at the start of July a parliamentary delegation 
of the Republic of Armenia will participate in a session of the 
CSCE Interparliamentary Assembly in Vienna.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Akhverdyan, chairman of the </F>
National-Democratic Union's Human Rights Club: "`Criminal' 
Statistics: In 1993, One in Three Crimes in the Republic 
Remained Unsolved"] 
  [Text] Obviously statistical analysis, and especially in 
the sphere of "the crime situation and the percentage of crimes 
solved, investigative work, and individual areas of procuracy 
oversight" does not reveal to the full extent the crime picture 
in the republic. Behind each incident of crime there are 
concrete human lives. Nevertheless, statistics allow us to 
follow the development of very alarming trends and, as a natural 
reaction, take at least the necessary preventive measures to 
avert their further acceleration. 
  Last year Armenian organs of internal affairs registered 
13,081 crimes. For the first time over the past five years, we 
see a decline in the number of registered crimes (1988--6,324, 
1989--8,415, 1990--12,100, 1991--13,109, 1992--16,251). One has 
to admit that in the years past, "good" reports were the goal. 
Many crimes, especially on everyday level, essentially were 
concealed and were not registered. That is, nobody ever had the 
real picture. To a certain extent this phenomenon, but on a 
relatively lesser scale, is present today as well. 
  As we can see, in many respects the year 1988 was 
significant 
for us. The peak of national awareness, manifestation of a high 
degree of organization, affected even the crime situation. 
Armenia had not had such a low crime rate since 1980. The 
subsequent lawlessness does not need any comment. Its causes 
have been described many times: Social disintegration has lead 
to the total impoverishment of almost all population strata and 
brought about a crime boom. 
  In such analyses, the custom is to quote the crime rate per 
100,000 persons. This indicator does not lend itself to 
measurement, however, because of the endless stream of 
emigration. According to official data, 300,000--and to 
unofficial, 800,000--Armenians already have left their homeland. 
Naturally, the decline in the total number of crimes over the 
year is closely related to, and actually is caused by, this sad 
reality. The migrants, some of whom undoubtedly belong to the 
well-off population strata, had been an attractive target for 
criminals. So to a certain extent emigration created 
unemployment of a sort among the petty-crime brotherhood. Not to 
mention the fact that, according to some reliable sources, 
emigration processes decimated the local criminal world as well. 
  At the same time it should be noted that the crime 
coefficient per 100,000 population in Armenia has always been 
lower than the analogous indicators across the former Soviet 
Union, although, in our opinion, we should now discard 
comparative arithmetics. Each republic has its own internal 
political and social situation; it is hard to find a 
"counterpart" in a chaos, and does not make sense anyway. 
  Unlike the year before last, the geography of safe cities 
and 
regions has expanded. Their number reached 35. Yerevan's 
Shengavitskiy Rayon and Dilizhan remain "hot spots" (the crime 
rate has reached 136 percent (!?), as well as Spitakskiy, 
Sevanskiy, and Stepanavanskiy Rayons. Amazingly, this list 
includes border regions: Tavush, Tashir, Krasnoselsk, Goris, and 
Megru. 
  While overall crime declined, there has been a sharp 
increase 
in the number of grave crimes registered by criminal 
investigation departments (especially increased theft of 
personal property)--from 4,526 to 5,602. This trend was 
registered in republic's 42 cities and regions. So, in reality 
the safe status of the cities is very much a matter of 
conventional definition. The number of grave crimes fell in nine 
rayons, including two in Yerevan--Mashtotskiy (0.4 percent) and 
Sovetskiy (20 percent)--but expressed in percents they are not 
impressive. While in the past Yerevan accounted for more than 
half of the registered crimes, including grave crimes, last year 
the seats of criminal activities expanded beyond its boundary. 
For instance, the growth of grave crime has been registered in 
Talinskiy Rayon (115 percent), Dilizhan (400 percent), and 
Vanadzor (78 percent), as well as Tavushskiy (223 percent), 
Masisskiy (83 percent), Spitakskiy (128 percent), Stepanavanskiy 
(221 percent), Tashirskiy (363 percent), Akhuryanskiy (150 
percent), Martuninskiy (48 percent), Vardenisskiy (74 percent), 
Gorisskiy (112 percent), Yekhegnadzorskiy (81 percent), 
Kalanskiy (60 percent), and Sisianskiy (132 percent) Rayons. 
  Looking at statistics by the type of crime, it should be 
noted that the number of violent crimes decreased somewhat, 
including that of premeditated murder (-35), attempted murder 
(-13), and assault (-78). In the area of general crimes for 
mercenary motives, the number of thefts of state and public 
property dropped dramatically (-4,388), while theft of personal 
property increased (+1,328), including apartment burglaries 
(+638), robberies (+112), and muggings (+239). This does not at 
all mean that state property is now better protected. Everything 
usable already has been plundered from plants and factories. In 
one year the number of such crimes dropped from 6,709 to 2,321. 
The ordinary guy, on the other hand, essentially found himself 
unprotected. This is extremely dangerous, since this trend is on 
the increase. There is also a "pick-up" in the sphere of crimes 
committed for economic and mercenary motives. 
  There also has been a sharp increase in crimes associated 
with the manufacture, possession, and use of drugs--from 162 to 
368. Against this backdrop, the MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] decision to abolish the corresponding unit in its 
structure looks even more strange. Now it is unclear who deals 
with this problem or how it is dealt with professionally. As to 
all sorts of hints and statements that we are "all right" when 
it comes to the drug problem, they are groundless. Amazingly, 
according to city and rayon procuracy statistical reports, not a 
single inspection has been conducted on how the law on combating 
drug addiction among minors is carried out. 
  Quite understandably, the number of traffic accidents is 
down--from 887 to 525, including those with fatalities--from 325 
to 198. There are also fewer car thefts--from 957 to 376. There 
are fewer crimes committed in public transportation, which 
actually is not surprising, keeping in mind that practically 
everywhere it simply is not operating. 
  One would think that the drop in the number of violent 
crimes 
can be considered a positive factor. Very alarming, however, is 
the number of unsolved cases of premeditated murder (105) and 
attempted murder (12). Of the former, 43 took place in Yerevan; 
15, in the disaster zone; 28, in border regions. Of 68 unsolved 
cases of assault, 41 also occurred in the capital. Also there 
has been an increase in the number of unsolved mugging attacks 
against individuals' personal property--from 120 to 228, and in 
Yerevan--from 55 to 111. Five of 38 rapes in the republic have 
not been solved. As a whole, the number of unsolved crimes in 
the republic is 4,565. No matter how optimistic this figure 
looks--at least against the backdrop of prior years' 
statistics--all it says is that one in three crimes remain 
unsolved. In this situation there is no reason to say that law 
enforcement organs are fulfilling their direct functions. The 
overwhelming majority (3,470) are general crimes for mercenary 
motives. 
  According to MVD data, last year 402 crimes were committed 
by 
minors or with their participation. In Yerevan this figure 
increased from 128 to 142. Of 278 criminal cases referred to 
court, 235 are theft of state, public, or personal property. 
Keeping in mind that last year in the same category of crime 
3,381 incidents remained unsolved, it is simply impossible to 
judge the whole picture. 
  On the whole the crime situation in the republic remains 
difficult and most likely will exacerbate, aided by the 
worsening of the socioeconomic situation of the majority of the 
population. Not to mention serious shortcomings and deficiencies 
in the work of law enforcement organs. The lack of a legislative 
base also makes itself felt. Law regulating the activities of 
the Procuracy and the MVD still have not been adopted. 
  As to figures, the MVD provides the data that reflects 
quantitative indicators of the crime situation, which is not 
enough for an in-depth analysis of today's problems of crime 
suppression, Statistics must reflect quantitative 
characteristics of the crime situation, including information on 
persons committing criminal actions, the situation with respect 
to repeat, group, and organized crime, the percentage of 
unsolved crimes, and a number of other things. One thing is 
clear. A decline in the total number of registered crimes at 
this point does not allow us to say that the situation has 
stabilized, and even less so--that crime suppression has 
improved. 
  We will cover the methods of getting out of the current 
dismal situation in our subsequent articles, after discussing 
the subject in the National-Democratic Union's human rights club.

<F P=106> [Article M. Sarkisyan: "Is Forum `Going Into Battle?'"] </F>
  [Text] The Fourth Armenian Businessmen's Forum has 
completed its work. The organization, created with the purpose 
of combining the efforts of business people and helping Armenia, 
which is going through transition period difficulties, finally 
has made it to the big league. 
  This happened at the price of debunking a myth nurtured for 
decades: That all the diaspora as a whole and its business 
circles in particular think about is the good of their historic 
homeland. It turned out that most of them if they have not lost 
interest in the Motherland entirely, at the very least are quite 
indifferent to it. 
  It also became clear for everyone that there is no place for 
charity in business. Emotions are nice, but business may 
flourish only if the necessary financial and legal base have 
been created for it. 
  And last, the forum participants have realized that their 
attention should center on the interests of Armenian economy. 
The efforts of Armenian businessmen should be directed at its 
prosperity. Correspondingly, they will reap dividends due them 
only if this goal is achieved. 
  Let us start from the beginning, though. The latest forum 
resembled only remotely the first one, which had been marked by 
pomp and universal euphoria. It differed in the composition of 
participants as well. Of the 120 foreign guests, 80 were our 
Iranian compatriots. I should note that four years ago there 
were guests from more than 50 countries. In this connection, 
France d'Arteng, the French ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary to the Republic of Armenia, very tactfully and, 
of course, quite correctly pointed out that this was to be 
expected. And in fact, unlike in the United States and France, 
Armenians in the Near East, in particular in Iran, live in 
communities, are better organized, and have retained their 
ethnic values and hence the attachment to their historic 
homeland. Besides, Iran is our neighbor; transportation 
questions between us do get resolved one way or the other; 
banking ties are being established; the population's standard of 
living, the degree of technological development do not differ 
substantially. So why not trade? It was the fortuitous 
combination of these two circumstances that has led to a rather 
resolved Iranian delegation landing in Yerevan. 
  This was matched by the atmosphere in the government's 
conference hall, where the forum participants held their 
meetings. For two days they discussed ways to overcome the 
stagnation that has settled into their work. Many quite 
openly--bordering on unfairly--expressed doubt in the abilities 
of this organization's leadership. It came to a point where the 
board chairman, V. Dzhazmadaryan, remarked that he might as well 
step down. 
  Of course, the personality factor plays an important role in 
any undertaking. Seriously speaking, however, the main topic of 
the forum was the need to provide forward momentum. 
  Among objective reasons the only one that actually stands in 
the way is the lack of a proper legislative base. Jumping ahead, 
I will say that Armenian Supreme Council Deputy Ye. Shamshyan 
informed the businessmen that a draft law on protection of 
foreign investment is being readied to be submitted for 
discussion. Moreover, he asked for proposals as to what 
normative acts are needed in order to get things moving. 
  Very little has been accomplished over the past few years. 
Not just in absolute terms, which would be understandable and 
explainable, but even taking into account the opportunities 
available both in the republic and outside it. Especially 
impressive were remarks by O. Seferyan from India; A. 
Ter-Torosyan, a businessman from the United States; A. Asriyan, 
the Armenian Entrepreneurs Union's Chairman; and L. Agaronyan, 
the chairman of the Armenian-Iranian Chamber of Commerce. In 
particular, among priorities they named the need to get 
compatriots from CIS countries involved, to develop more 
flexible and effective forms of participation in resolving the 
tasks facing Armenia, but of most importance, to begin concrete 
work. 
  The primary means to serve this goal will be the Corporation 
of Armenian Businessmen joint-stock society, set up by the 
forum, which will assist in the development of small- and 
medium-size business. Judging by the participants' enthusiasm, 
its charter capital will exceed by far the originally planned 
$200,000. As to expected dividends, nobody can guarantee them. 
As in any business, there is risk. 
  Napoleon used to say that the most important part is to get 
into a battle, and then see. The Armenian Businessmen's Forum 
has moved from words to action. Among things on the drawing 
board is to create with the participation of the European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development a financial corporation with 
a charter capital of $12 million, which will meet the highest 
standards of a commercial bank. 
  As to the forum organization, the audience was not ready for 
normal work, and there was a shortage of information materials. 
During Mme. d'Arteng's speech, the forum's Board Secretary Ruben 
Grigoryan had to give up his seat in the Presidium to the 
interpreter. And when Mr. A. Sobkhani, Iran's acting charge 
d'affairs in Armenia, took the floor, there was no interpreter 
in the conference hall at all. In desperation, he addressed the 
audience half-jokingly in Armenian: "There are so many Armenians 
from Iran here; how can it be that there is no interpreter?" And 
then he and an interpreter took turns at the microphone... 
  Trifles perhaps? Depends how you look at it. In any case, if 
these are trifles, they are certainly unpleasant ones. 
  Another conference of Armenian businessmen is behind us. 
Also 
behind us is another year of work, the only result of which is 
the emergence of the Corporation of Armenian Businessmen. There 
is another year ahead of us--until another forum, or rather, a 
whole year which, I am sure, will finally show who is who among 
businessmen and what their word is worth.

<F P=106> [Report by Veniamin Goltsov: "Iran-Azerbaijan: New </F>
Contracts"] 
  [Text] The negotiations in Tehran between 
representatives of the oil companies of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and the Azerbaijani Republic have culminated in the signing 
of two contracts. In accordance with these, Azerbaijan's oilmen 
are to perform engineering-survey and seismo-exploratory 
operations in the Southeast Caspian that total more than $3 
million. 
  As Khoshbakht Yusuf-zade, doctor of geological and 
mineralogical sciences and vice president of the State Oil 
Company of Azerbaijan, announced, business relations with the 
National Oil Company of the neighboring state began to take 
shape by the end of the 1960's, when Azerbaijani geophysicists 
conducted research on a study of the geological structure of the 
mineral resources in the Southern Caspian that the Iranian side 
needed. 
  Our specialists presented Iran with even fuller information 
on the geological section of the shelf in accordance with 
contracts for 1987 and 1991. It made possible the adoption of a 
decision on the need for the drilling of the first offshore well 
off the southern shores of the Caspian. 
  The sinking of a parametric well in the geologically complex 
structure was accomplished successfully by our Khazar-2 drilling 
ship. The presence of hydrocarbon raw material in the said area 
was confirmed. 
  The specialized ships Zokhrab Veliyev and Rezonans equipped 
with everything necessary for the performance of a whole set of 
operations ensuing from the new contracts between the oil 
companies of the two neighboring Caspian states will be setting 
off shortly for the southern shores of the Caspian.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zardusht Alizade by Eynulla Fatullayev; </F>
place and date not given: "`SD's Do Not Make Coups'"] 
  [Text] "Political Palette of Our Times" is a new 
column which we offer our readers. The material of this column 
will describe the various parties functioning in Azerbaijan and 
their leaders. Here you will learn about the republic's 
politicians and their views of the political situation. Today's 
guest is a colleague, editor of the newspaper ISTIGLAL, and a 
leader of the Social Democratic Party of Azerbaijan. 
  [Fatullayev] Zardusht bey, you were a pioneer of the 
Azerbaijan Popular Front in 1989. But on the threshold of the 
January events you and a group of APF [Azerbaijani Popular 
Front] activists declared that you were withdrawing and forming 
a social democratic party. What were the main disagreements that 
brought about this split? 
  [Alizade] Yes, I was the first to begin to gather people 
around myself and to campaign for the creation of a democratic 
organization for perestroyka, glasnost, and the defense of our 
Karabakh. I provided the name of the organization and its 
slogan, and I wrote the first version of its program, albeit 
very imperfect. It is not a question of an idle "I this and I 
that" here, I am still proud that at that time I yielded to a 
sincere summons of my heart and found within myself the resolve 
to make a break with the settled measured tenor of life of an 
armchair scholar and to throw myself into the thick of political 
struggle. People of Baku, professionals with pure intentions, 
gathered in the Provisional Action Center of the APF in 1988. 
Subsequently, following its association with the Varlyg 
organization in March 1989, the APF became soiled by party-mafia 
clan intrigues. My first shock occurred in the fall of 
1989--people who had pioneered the Front and who had sworn 
fealty to the Motherland and the people broke. Since then the 
APF has become something alien to me. I protested against the 
troglodytic anticommunism, unbridled nationalism, and moral 
relativism of the "bey's" with plebeian mentality. On 7 January 
1990 I quit the APF, but remained true to the ideas of 
democracy, human rights, liberty, and justice that had been 
embedded in the APF's precongress program. The program of the 
SDPA [Social Democratic Party of Azerbaijan] is, in fact, the 
first version of the APF program. A two-sector economy, 
political pluralism, and pluralism of the forms of ownership, a 
return to national sources, and openness to world culture and 
experience--this is the essence of our program. 
  The reason for the split may be expressed very concisely. 
Those who fiercely resisted implementation of the KGB's "20 
January" plan and the rest, who subsequently became social 
democrats, who deliberately, and unquestioningly, led the people 
to slaughter [sentence as published]. The social democrats have 
never led and will never lead the people to the slaughter. 
  [Fatullayev] The SDPA is one of the leading parties in our 
republic. There is no doubt that the party's assertive activity 
throughout all the previous political peripeteias has attracted 
the attention of the community of the republic. How do you, a 
leader of Azerbaijan's social democrats, evaluate your party's 
activity? 
  [Alizade] I believe that the SDPA has performed an 
exceptionally important role in the enlightenment of the masses. 
Our party had and has now the courage to rise up against the 
opinion of the majority and to not only say but also shout the 
truths, by disregard for which leaders relying on the blind 
support of people they have deceived are leading people to 
disaster. I consider the party's main merit our consistent 
campaign for national reconciliation, which has now become the 
prevailing political idea. It is the SDPA that, by its realistic 
policy, has contributed to our people resisting xenophobia and 
not sliding, like the Armenian people, into the abyss of 
fascism. After all, the blind, total denial by one nation of 
another is fascism. We may speak boldly of an anti-Turkic 
fascism that has conquered in Armenia, but in Azerbaijan the 
people have not succumbed to the vain hankerings of various gray 
"animals" and have not fallen into the trap of anti-Armenian 
fascism. 
  [Fatullayev] Many leaders of right and ultra-right parties 
have stated repeatedly that Azerbaijani social democracy does 
not have a chance of winning party influence among the 
population of the republic any time soon since contemporary 
Azerbaijani society has not reached the corresponding stage of 
development. 
  [Alizade] Many leaders of right and ultra-right parties of 
Azerbaijan are distinguished by a utopian nature of their views 
bordering on caricature. These people, blindly carrying out the 
orders of their masters, are incapable of understanding the 
normalities of social development. They are unwilling to be 
reconciled with the idea of the exhausted nature of their 
function of destroyer of the totalitarian state. Their extreme 
approach is the wedge that dislodged the other, Bolshevik, 
wedge. The time for creation is nigh, and, as the experience of 
almost all the post-socialist countries testifies, social 
democrats are performing not at all the least role in this 
process. Of course, everything depends on the specific 
conditions, but the leaders of the SDPA see this normality and 
are working to ensure that the predictions of the false oracles 
not come to pass. The idea of the exclusiveness of the 
Azerbaijani people, to which normality does not extend, is a 
foolish idea, and I do not believe that it has a chance of being 
realized. The people long for social justice, and the social 
democrats will fight for it. 
  [Fatullayev] In the opinion of many foreign politicians, 
present-day world social democracy has taken a step to the 
right, having thereby renounced some of its strategies to some 
extent. How do you evaluate such changes in the purposes and 
tasks of world social democracy? 
  [Alizade] The political success of the European social 
democrats and the high standard of the peoples in Europe testify 
that this is the right course. As far as "fidelity to 
principles" is concerned, this is an invention of limited 
conformists. Social conditions in a particular era may engender 
"principles" that are very useful for the defense of the 
interests of the working people. But societies develop, and the 
new conditions could create a dilemma: either to remain loyal to 
the "principles" and lag behind life and become detached from 
the interests of those same working people or, on the other 
hand, to adjust the "principles" and continue to uphold the 
interests of those same working people. Of course, the processes 
of stratification in Western societies differ from ours, but on 
the path toward the social market economy Azerbaijan will 
inevitably pass through the stage of "national accord" for the 
sake of the efficiency of the transition from one system to 
another. This is why the SDPA has not a clear-cut "class-based" 
program but an orientation toward the accomplishment first and 
foremost of national goals. This is why the SDPA is not 
"struggling" against "capital" but struggling to ensure that 
national capital stand on its own two feet and begin to work. 
After all, without the "employer," there is no "wage worker." 
Under the conditions of total state ownership, on the other 
hand, struggling against the national state is meaningless. The 
SDPA is struggling against the corrupt and predatory state 
bureaucracy, for denationalization and privatization, and for 
government protection of the population. The tasks coincide, as 
you can see, with the goals proclaimed by the state. The entire 
problem is that the state proclaims goals and in practice does 
everything the other way about; we, on the other hand, are 
trying to ensure that state tasks be accomplished correctly. 
  [Fatullayev] The press organ of the SDPA--the newspaper 
ISTIGLAL--of which you are the editor, is at the present time 
one of the most popular print publications among the republic 
press. What would you like ISTIGLAL to become in the future? 
  [Alizade] I would like to see ISTIGLAL become a more diverse 
newspaper with information on world politics, culture, sport, 
the home, the environment, and such. Unfortunately, ISTIGLAL is 
currently the canvassing organ of the social democrats. No 
money, that's why. We are writhing in the grip of a financial 
crisis. 
  [Fatullayev] Zardusht bey, when will Azerbaijani democracy 
come to power? 
  [Alizade] Answering this is very easy. The social democrats 
do not make coups. Consequently, we have to wait for the 
parliamentary elections. At these the social democrats should 
increase their representation. Then work in parliament. The 
people, primarily "people working for wages," small-time 
entrepreneurs, and people of the free professions, have to see 
for themselves that this small faction is consistently defending 
their rights. Serious success should be expected at the 
elections of the year 2000. This is my forecast. But in life 
anything can happen. It cannot be ruled out that crime bosses 
could physically eliminate party leaders. Or that the right and 
ultra-right leaders could plunge the people into such a morass 
of misfortunes that the country's very existence is in jeopardy. 
The SDPA will fight against such a development of events. The 
SDPA will fight for the realization of our optimistic forecast.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandra Tevzadze, member of the Deported </F>
Meskhetians Subcommission of the Parliamentary Commission for 
the Protection of Human Rights and National Minorities Affairs: 
"We Must Break Down the Barrier of Distrust"] 
  [Text] Our society is well aware that on 15 November 1944 
the Mohammedan population of Meskhetia-Dzhavaketia--chiefly 
children, women, and old people (the men were fighting in the 
war...)--were all deported to Central Asia. 
  The pretext for the deportation was that they were 
"unreliable" in districts bordering on Turkey. 
  Most of the deportees were Moslemized-Turkefied Georgians, 
as 
is confirmed by plenty of historical documents, and I will not 
dwell on this matter here. 
  Much has been written and said about the historical 
processes 
that resulted in that demographic pattern in 
Meskhetia-Dzhavakhetia. Let me recapitulate: first, 
incorporation by the Ottoman Empire, followed by Tsarist 
Russia's long-range anti-Georgian actions, and finally the 
Soviet system's monstrous nationality policy, cut a substantial 
portion of the Georgian people off from their native culture, 
deprived them of their language, destroyed their national 
consciousness, and finally made them victims to Stalinist 
repression--the Mohammedan Meskhetians were uprooted from their 
native soil, and the final thread linking them to their 
motherland was broken. There in Central Asia, in a Moslem 
environment, they became further denationalized. 
  Today, they find it difficult to give a definite answer to 
the question, "Who are you?" They shrug their shoulders, look at 
each other, start to speak, argue, and finally... they look at 
us as if to say, You hold the key to that mystery, you know more. 
  After the deportation, two groups of political leaders 
arose, 
with opposing orientations--pro-Georgian and pro-Turkish. 
  The pro-Turkish leaders emphasize the deportee's present 
situation--Moslem religion, Turkish language, and Azberbaijani 
surnames and nationality listed in their documents. These 
leaders engage in falsifying history and they instill among 
their own people and broad segments of society the notion that 
Meskhetia was historically inhabited by Turkish tribes, and that 
they themselves are descendants of these tribes. 
  The pro-Georgian leaders (L. Baratashvili, Kh. Gozalishvili, 
and I. Varsknelidze), drawing upon historical documents, tried 
to restore and reenforce Georgian national consciousness among 
the people. They always cooperated with Georgia's leading 
intellectuals and also, though not always successfully, tried to 
establish contact with the Georgian government. 
  Everyone wants to return to his homeland, regardless of 
national orientation. This problem became especially acute after 
the Fergana tragedy. Let me also add that of all the peoples of 
the former Soviet Union who were deported in 1944, only the 
Mohammedan Meskhetians have failed to gain real rehabilitation; 
they are the only ones who have not been repatriated. 
  The hysteria that broke out in 1989-91 regarding this 
unfortunate people did so much to poison our society's 
consciousness that its effects are still felt. This 
long-suffering people should be returned to their homeland, but 
our country's vital interests demand that the Meskhetians be 
brought back with a Georgian national consciousness. 
  What is being done in Georgia to accomplish this task? 
  The deportee issue is being dealt with by both legislative 
agencies (the Commission for the Protection of Human Rights and 
National Minorities Affairs) and executive bodies (the Committee 
for the Protection of Human Rights and Interethnic Relations, 
the Refugees and Settlement Committee). In addition, a 
governmental commission to settle the deportee problem has been 
set up--though only formally so far. 
  Despite all these protectors, things are not getting 
anywhere. The Parliamentary Commission has drafted several bills 
on deportee rehabilitation, but it is unlikely, unfortunately, 
that Parliament will pass them. Instead of a bill, a totally 
"bland" draft decree has been placed on the agenda of 
Parliament's plenary session, having to do with granting 
citizenship to repatriates. Meanwhile, our bill has been waiting 
in vain for Parliament's attention. Children of the deportees 
have been in Tbilisi for almost a year now, living in a 
dormitory in the Gldani district. There are about 80 boys. They 
are studying Georgian language and history in the Sulkhan-Saba 
Orbeliani Pedagogical Institute. Twelve young men are trainees 
in the Military Academy. They are also studying Georgian. What 
shall we do with these boys, who keep asking us the same 
question every day: When are we to get our Georgian surnames and 
nationality back? That's the question we have been asking 
Parliament, and we are eagerly awaiting their answer. Things 
were not helped by the Head of State's Order No. 106, issued 18 
May 1993, concerning the problems of deportees. The basic part 
of the Order remains unimplemented to this day. 
  Just as a man cannot hide from himself, no people can escape 
its history. The Meskhetians' historical misfortunes are a part 
of our own common historical fate. The mistakes which were 
committed in the recent or distant past and which brought the 
Mohammedan population of Meskhetia-Dzhavakhetia to such a tragic 
plight, are something we have to rectify. It is a sad reality of 
Georgia's history that being cut off for so long from their 
native culture has brought it about that the Mohammedan 
Meskhetians do not know their identity, and today, left without 
a homeland, they have come to our door and are meekly waiting 
(bless their patience!) for us to let them come home. 
  I'll go further: even those deportees who, under the 
influence of the pro-Turkish orientation, consider themselves 
Turks, deserve our care and protection. Especially considering 
experience we have had in which, given the necessary explanation 
work and sincere treatment, these people have turned back to 
Georgianness. The fact that only a few of the Mohammedan 
Meskhetians who were repatriated in the 1970s and 1980s still 
remain in Georgia, while the rest were expelled again, must be 
on our conscience alone. I take full responsibility in saying 
this, because I was a direct participant in that deplorable 
process. 
  Clear proof of the fact that we are not taking care of those 
that do remain can be seen in the predicament of the Mohammedan 
Meskhetians living in the town of Kopitnari, Samtredskiy Rayon. 
Consider two aspects: schooling, and the restoration of surnames 
and nationality. The younger school children have to walk a long 
way, which is dangerous given today's crime situation, because 
the Mohammedan population is the most vulnerable (last October, 
the fighting there cost the lives of two children). There is a 
building in the town in which elementary classes were being 
taught a few years ago. For two years now the people have been 
asking for the classes to be resumed. They are asking for 
schooling, to be taught in Georgian, and we aren't doing a 
thing. The same is true of the reinstatement of surnames and 
nationality. Their applications still lie untouched in the Rayon 
Civil Registry Office. A Meskhetian girl named Amina, who died 
in the tragic events of October, had taken part in a television 
program in connection with the start of the school year in 
Georgia on 20 September, just a few days before she died. A 
reporter asked her what she wanted the most. Her answer--in 
beautiful Georgian--: "To go to school and grow up to be a good 
Georgian for my country." 
  The Georgian people and those who were cut off from them 
must 
break down the barrier of distrust which was erected several 
years ago by the anti-Meskhetian campaign fomented by 
destructive forces.

<F P=106> [Guest commentary by Hill Kulu: "Majority of Russian </F>
Speakers Will Link Their Fate With Estonia"] 
  [Text] Relations between the Estonian majority and the 
Russian-speaking minority are now better than they have ever 
been, writes Hill Kulu. The writer is a researcher of Estonian 
migrations who is currently a guest researcher at the Migration 
Institute. 
  The status of the Russian-speaking people in the Baltic 
countries has been described with terms like: "violation of 
human rights" and "oppression of a minority." Nevertheless, very 
little has been known about what these Russian speakers actually 
think about it themselves, what their experiences have actully 
been during the changes of the last few years, what are their 
goals and aspirations. The Russian-speaking people of the 
Baltics have become, regardless of their own desires, tokens in 
a political game that has most actively been played by Russian 
politicians. 
  The report of the Estonian Academy was published at the end 
of last year. It dealt with the impact that Estonian 
independence has had, between 1986 and 1993, on relations 
between Estonians and Russian speakers living in Estonia. 
  The report contained a survey conducted during different 
years, in which about 1,000 randomly selected Estonians and 
Russian speakers were asked to give their opinion on various 
social, political, and economic changes. 
  The survey revealed that, at the end of the Soviet era, 
1986, 
more than half of Estonians felt that relations with Russians 
were poor. This aptly describes the situation in which the 
relative number of Estonians as a proportion of the population 
of Estonia was continuously decreasing, and newcomers were 
increasingly taking over the really important positions in 
society. The majority of Russian speakers said that relations 
were normal, but, deep down inside, they felt that relations 
between Russian speakers and Estonians were strained. 
  After the birth of the Estonian popular movement the strain 
emerged into open, public view. The situation was at its worst 
in 1988, but, since then, it has gradually improved. In 1993 the 
majority of both Estonians and Russian speakers considered their 
mutual relations to be normal, or even good to excellent. 
  In the opinion of Estonia's Russian speakers as well as the 
Estonian majority, their mutual relations have improved during 
the process that has led to Estonia's independence. They are 
better in the Estonia of today than they have ever been before. 
This positive development clearly indicates that both ethnic 
groups have accepted their changed positions in Estonia's 
society. 
  It is not possible to consider the Russian speakers in 
Estonia to be one homogenous ethnic entity. Within their numbers 
there continue to be various groups with diverse attitudes 
toward Estonia and Estonian aspirations. 
  Based on these attitudes, the Russian-speaking segment of 
the 
population can be categorized into five different groups. 
  The first group is formed by those who have been negative 
toward the Estonian popular movement and have not wanted 
Estonian citizenship. Among the 40,000 Russian citizens living 
in Estonia, this group is a majority. Generally speaking, 
numerous former party officials and Army officers, who have lost 
their positions and privileges through the change in conditions, 
belong to this group. Among other things, they have actively 
opposed the breakup of the USSR and have supported Russian 
conservatives. At the present time less than 10 percent of 
Estonia's Russian speakers belong to this group. 
  The second group is made up of those who have had 
reservations about Estonian national aspirations, and have not 
wanted Estonian citizenship. They currently constitute about 
15-20 percent of their ethnic group. 
  The third group is made up of the uncertain. Throughout the 
process leading to an independent Estonia, this group has been 
the largest. Its proportional size varied between 40 and 50 
percent. Only after Estonia became independent did it begin to 
decrease in size, and at the present its size is around 15 
percent. 
  One positive development, however, is that the majority of 
those who were uncertain have, during the last couple of years, 
accepted the Estonian aspirations and have decided to link their 
own futures with Estonia. This fourth group, therefore, regards 
Estonia with cautious approval. The fifth group is composed of 
those who have actively supported Estonian aspirations from the 
very beginning and have regarded their own future to be in 
Estonia. 
  Thus about 60 percent of Russian speakers view things 
favorably, more or less. In 1990 this figure was only 30 percent. 
  During the last two years an increasing number of Estonia's 
Russian speakers have accepted the developments in Estonian 
society, and want to, themselves, be participants therein. A 
good example of this were the local elections in October of 
1993, when two-thirds of the 27 Russian speakers elected to the 
Tallinn city board of governors approved of an independent 
Estonia and supported economic reforms. 
  Nevertheless, a small part of Russian speakers have opposed 
the development of an independent Estonia right from the start. 
Numerous pensioners are included in this group, which means that 
their numbers will gradually decrease in the future. 
  It appears that the rapid progress in Estonia's economy has 
had its influence on the change in attitudes among 
Russian-speaking people. Many have noticed how good conditions 
actually are when compared, for example, with Russia. 
  Zhirinovskiy-style speeches, which are currently arousing 
fears in Europe, were given in Estonia as early as 1988, and 
there were many speakers and listeners both. The situation has 
changed now: Although speakers can still be found, the audiences 
have withered away to nonexistence. 
  It is clear that, in the future, continued tolerance will be 
necessary among both Estonians and Russian speakers. Some 
ill-considered decisions have created unnecessary strain and 
have retarded progress. An example of such a decision is the 
outcome of the 1992 Estonian referendum, on the basis of which 
the Estonian cabinet did not actively endorse the citizenship 
applications of Russian speakers that had been supportive of 
Estonian actions. 
  Now that Estonians rule Estonia, they should more actively 
aid the integration of the Russian speakers. This is important 
also on the basis of Estonia's own security considerations. 
  On their part, the Russian speakers must learn to actively 
use the democratic organs of the Estonian state and become 
accustomed to the role of being a minority, which may well be 
difficult for members of a great nation.

<F P=106> [Article by Liga Laizane: "9,000 Discipline Violations in </F>
the Armed Forces."] 
  [Text] Riga, May 6. Last year, 9,000 discipline violations 
were found in the Armed Forces, as reported on Friday by Valdis 
Petersons, Chief of the Mobile Department and Personnel 
Department of the Armed Forces (AF), at the meeting of AF unit 
and subdivision commanders. 
  AF Commander Dainis Turlais stated at the meeting that the 
army units are artificial creations, where interrelationships 
are regulated only by laws and regulations, not by personal 
sympathies or antipathies. The duties of the army do not include 
the re-education, within 18 months, of hooligans into decent 
citizens. 
  Fifty-six percent of all violations, as mentioned by V. 
Petersons, were related to carelessness in the fulfillment of 
duties, involving violations during guard duty and internal 
service, 20 percent of violations -- drinking, 16 percent -- 
unauthorized departure from the post and not returning from 
leave on time, as well as 3 percent of cases of callous 
harassment of fellow servicemen. V. Liepins stated that the 
latter are difficult to identify because they are being covered 
up, and it could be assumed that there have been many more such 
cases. Specifically, those with the least education are the ones 
harassing their fellow servicemen. 
  Overall, regulations were mostly violated by soldiers in 
obligatory service, although 17 percent of these 9,000 
violations were incurred by instructors, 3 percent by officers 
and 0.8 percent by deputy officers. Thirty new officers and 200 
re-enlisted servicemen have been retired from duty because of 
drinking. 
  Last year, 16 servicemen lost their lives in the Armed 
Forces. Two of these were by suicide, and there were also 12 
attempted suicides by servicemen. The remainder died in 
accidents. As stressed by Ivars Grava, Chief of the Legal 
Department of the Armed Forces, in the army last year, not a 
single serviceman intentionally murdered another servicemen. 
Nevertheless, V. Liepins confirmed the facts that the body of 
one serviceman was found with knife wounds in a courtyard of one 
of the houses on Marijas Street, and the body of one serviceman 
-- by the railroad tracks. The causes of death for the others 
were drowning, traffic accidents while on leave, heart disease, 
and also two cases where the servicemen had not used care when 
handling their firearms. 
  The Chief of the Medical Service of the Armed Forces stated 
that a very serious problem in the army is the development of 
psychological problems -- pathological personality changes, 
which, especially in the first three months of duty, create a 
poor relationship with fellow servicemen, and the commanders are 
unable to deflect conflict situations. Because of this reason, 
many servicemen have been retired.

<F P=106> [Article by Peteris Zvidrins, Academician of the Latvian </F>
Academy of Sciences: "Demographic Situation Worsening: Almost 
One Quarter of a Million of Latvia's Inhabitants Have No Family 
Members -- They Are the So-Called Singles."] 
  [Text] Four years ago the former Supreme Soviet adopted the 
declaration of independence. The half-Latvian Latvia is still 
not completely free today, but it will be soon. The last 
thousands of Russian army soldiers and officers, and some of 
their family members, will leave Latvia soon. 
  The statistical data have been summarized for the results of 
the natural movements and migration in the past year. As was 
expected, the outcome is not too appealing. In addition, this 
year has started with an even bleaker picture. 
  There were 14,595 marriages registered last year, which was 
over 400 marriages less than in 1992. As a comparison, there 
were over 25,000 marriages concluded in the years 1986 - 1988. 
In the first quarter of this year, there were almost two-fold 
less marriages registered in comparison with the previous year. 
Thus, at the end of this year, a new record with 
long-term negative results is expected. 
  Of course, this attitude taken by young people towards 
marriage and the formation of a family is not accidental. It is 
a reaction to today's difficult socio-economic situation in the 
nation. We can also agree with the viewpoint of the famous 
Toronto psychotherapist, Voldemars Gulens, that an important 
role in demographic apathy is played by the relationship between 
the government and society. These days, more and more young 
people do not wish to formalize marriages, and the so-called 
consensual marriages, where the partners do not register, are 
becoming increasing more popular in Latvia. These are 
encountered quite often in Scandinavia and various other Western 
countries. Still, they do not have a firm basis in our country 
and, as we will see later, they cannot compensate for the lack 
of births in registered marriages. 
  Furthermore, there is a rather high rate of marital 
instability in our country. It is true that the number and 
frequency of divorces were at a lower level last year than in 
1992, when of every 100 marriages, 77 ended in divorce. Last 
year, this indicator fell to 70, but was still the highest in 
the world. It is characteristic that every fourth person 
divorces repeatedly. Apparently our present-day society is 
thoroughly tainted by egotism. 
  More than 5 years have elapsed since the last population 
census. Until the next one, which will most likely take place in 
1999, there are almost 5 years remaining. Data on the 
composition of the population are not as precise as they were 
right after the census. Nevertheless, we have been able to make 
certain calculations, acquiring additional data on family 
numbers and composition, as well as a distribution of the 
population according to family status. 
  At present, there are slightly more than 700 thousand 
families in Latvia. There is a trend towards a decrease in this 
number, especially with respect to large families. 
  Almost one quarter of a million of Latvia's inhabitants have 
no family members, and they are the so-called singles. Almost 
2/3 of these are women, and in addition, there are quite a few 
of the latter (about 90 thousand) who are 60 years of age and 
older. But a good proportion of the singles are capable of 
marriage and are of reproductive age. 
  Of those who are 16 years of age and older, 67 percent of 
men 
and 55 percent of women are married, while 21 percent of men and 
15 percent of women have never been married. Among women, there 
is a high proportion of widows (18 percent) and also divorcees 
(11 percent). The respective figures for men are 3.8 percent and 
8 percent. 
  The majority of our families are very small. In two out of 
three of our families, there are 2 (this is the majority) or 3 
family members. Nevertheless, 78 thousand families have 5 and 
more members. Due to the high rate of divorce, as well as the 
large discrepancy between the lifespans (mortality) of men and 
women, there is a relatively high number of so-called incomplete 
families, i.e., a family with only one spouse. And the 
demographic situation is predominantly determined by the welfare 
of the family. 
  Particular interest is paid by demographers and society to 
generational changes over time, especially the dynamics of 
births. Unfortunately, the past year was the bleakest in 
our century, with the exception of some of the war years. Only 
26,759 children were born in Latvia in 1993, which is almost 5 
thousand children less than in 1992. Not very long ago --in 
1986 and 1987 -- the number of births was 42 thousand. In the 
first quarter of this year, there have been one-fourth less 
births registered than at the same time of last year. Thus, the 
decline in births is continuing on a very severe course. For 
1986 - 1988, births per 100 women in their lifetime equalled 210 
to 215 children, in 1990, the birth rate was characterized by 
202 births, in 1991 -- by 186, in 1992 -- by 173, but in 1993 -- 
by about 150. We can almost certainly say that the indicator for 
this year will be perceptibly lower than in the prior year. 
Therefore, at the present time, there are less children coming 
into this world than ever before. It is possible that nowhere is 
the birth rate as low as it is in Latvia. In any case, the 
present birth rate is lower by one third than what is necessary 
the maintain a level changeover to the next generation. 
According to evaluations, the determining factor for this 
decline is the previously mentioned basic decrease in the number 
of marriages, and well as in marital fertility, both in urban 
and rural families. The positive effect of the increase in the 
proportion of rural inhabitants is not able to compensate for 
the basic losses occurring in young families as a result of 
present-day instability in welfare and the rather uncertain 
future. 
  Unfortunately, an even more unappealing picture is revealed 
in the analysis of the people's health and longevity. The 
total number of deaths for last year (39,197 persons) was the 
highest ever in Latvia's existence as a state. During 1993, 
it increased by almost 4 thousand people. And this occurred 
despite the fact that the number of inhabitants in our country 
decreased by 40 thousand people. 
  The severity of the situation is also evidenced by the fact 
that last year the number of deaths outweighed the number of 
births by 12,438 persons. Relatively speaking, this situation of 
depopulation can be characterized by these simple figures: last 
year, for every two births there were three deaths. This year 
has started in an even more tragic manner: deaths exceed births 
by 76 percent. This author, who was working on the preparation 
of United Nations conference documents in New York just one 
month ago, was able to confirm that nowhere else in the world is 
the situation any worse. In one graphic illustration, which was 
prepared for the Cairo Conference on Inhabitants and 
Developments (which will take place in the beginning of 
September), Latvia is specially shown as the nation with the 
highest mortality rate. It is true that not too far behind us 
are our neighboring countries of Lithuania and Estonia, as well 
as Ukraine, Russia, Hungary, and a few others with negative 
natural population changes. Still, the number of these countries 
in the world can be counted on the fingers of both hands. 
  The common mortality indicator -- the national average 
lifespan has fallen for the sixth year in a row, and it has been 
below 70 years since 1990. Last year, it quite honestly did not 
even reach 68 years ( 68.7 years in 1992), while in the rural 
areas, it declined to 60 years for men. Thirty years ago, the 
incidence of mortality was quite a bit lower, and the average 
lifespan for a newborn was calculated to be 71 years, while 
girls could hope to surpass a threshold of 75 years. We have now 
been thrown back to the level that existed in the mid 1950s... 
  In the past few years, there has been a perceptible increase 
in the incidence of unnatural deaths, indicating an 
unsatisfactory situation in society. In 1992, 4,485 persons died 
in accidents, from poisoning and trauma, and there were even 
more last year. Since 1989, the suicide rate has increased 
regularly, and it exceeded 1,000 for the first time last year. 
The number of deaths due to traffic accidents is also very high, 
as is the number of murders. 
  Society is being affected by the new boom in widespread 
alcoholism. Negative trends are also being noted with respect to 
drug addiction. Medical treatment centers report to have about 
40 thousand patients who are alcoholics and drug addicts, and 
report even more psychiatric patients. Unfortunately, a good 
proportion of our officials, whose direct duty is to help 
promote moral values by preventing the degradation of the 
nation's intellectual capacity are taking the easy route out. 
  With an increase in emigration by noncitizens and also, in 
part, by the assimilation of other nationalities, the proportion 
of Latvians in Latvia is increasing. Until now, the migration 
balance of inhabitants of Latvian nationality has been positive, 
overall, although the numerical increase has been small. In the 
year 1992, the number of deaths among Latvians was higher by 
several hundred than the number of Latvian newborns. Last year, 
this negative number increased almost eight-fold. For 1993, it 
has been estimated at minus 4,429. Thus, again the numerical 
representation of the Latvian people has started to decline, and 
at present it is slightly less than 1,400,000. It is true that 
the number of non-Latvians is decreasing even more rapidly, 
which is why the Latvian proportion of the total population has 
reached 54.5 percent (at the beginning of 1989, it was 52 
percent). It is most likely that this unique phenomenon, whereby 
the Latvian population is declining in number while its 
proportion in relation to the total population is increasing, 
should continue for a few more years. For the end of the 
century, we can hope that the birth rate will rise and that we 
will overcome the depopulation situation. First for Latvians 
(whose birth rate is slightly above the national average, and 
whose mortality rate --slightly lower) and then for the 
population of various other nationalities. But with the 
provision that the national demographic policies are 
sufficiently active. 
  Already in my earlier popular science articles, I had 
expressed my dissatisfaction with the passive position held by 
the state on solving demographic problems. Little has been done 
in the past few years to improve the situation. Just very 
recently, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia 
issued an order on the creation of the Demographic Commission. 
It is regrettable that the resolutions on the Demographic 
Commission and the National Program were not made much earlier. 
We should remember that similar resolutions were adopted even 
during the Soviet period, and they had a positive impact, 
overall. Demographic processes have an inert character, and 
every month of delay creates major losses in the living force, 
depleting the potential of a small people. 
  The present situation of our national economy does not 
provide hope for any type of perceptible demographic improvement 
in the next few years, but it is within the power of society to 
arrest the further disintegration of the demographic situation 
and to initiate a program of action for the improvement of 
people's health and family welfare, insuring a level changeover 
to the next generation.

<F P=106> [Article by Kestutis Jauniskis: "Two Opposition Parties Do </F>
Not Want the Present Government To Be Swept Away by Force"] 
  [Text] On May 2, the Nationalist Association and the 
Democratic Party registered an initiative group, which began to 
collect signatures for a referendum on the scheduling of 
elections to the Seimas ahead of schedule. The initiative group 
adopted an "Appeal to the Nation," which states that during the 
Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party's (LDDP) one and a half years 
in power, production has experienced a catastrophic decline and 
privatization has satisfied only the interests of the former 
nomenklatura and of the criminal structures. 
  The document also says that "the hopes for a spiritual 
rebirth of the nation are being frustrated, the society is 
drowning in alcohol, morals are declining, science, culture and 
education are being ignored." In the opinion of the authors of 
the appeal, "the only way to stop the disastrous LDDP rule is by 
holding the elections to the Seimas ahead of schedule. Such 
elections would establish a new relationship of political forces 
in the Lithuanian government and would invite conscientious, 
competent and determined representatives of the nation to the 
rudder of state." 
  At a press conference that was held in the Seimas palace 
yesterday, the chairman of the Nationalist Association, R. 
Smetona, said that the other parties of the opposition are also 
talking about the harm caused by the LDDP administration, but 
until now nobody had decided to start a signature gathering 
action. 
  In R. Smetona's opinion, it was possible to start collecting 
signatures on premature elections to the Seimas together with 
the action to collect signatures on the compensation of the 
people for their deposits, which was initiated by the Fatherland 
Association. According to the leader of the Nationalist 
Association, premature elections to the Seimas could take place 
simultaneously with the elections to the local administrative 
organs -- in February-March 1995. 
  One of the participants at the press conference, the deputy 
chairman of the Democratic Party and member of Seimas, J. 
Tartilas, said that one hears representatives of the other 
opposition parties expressing their views that the Nationalist 
Association and the Democratic Party would allegedly lose the 
referendum, but, in his opinion, "when you are trying to save a 
drowning person, you cannot be guided by cheap considerations." 
  When asked by LIETUVOS RYTAS to comment on the position of 
the Christian Democratic Party and of the Fatherland Association 
on the early elections (the KDP leaders having stated that they 
would not launch any action to collect signatures on the 
introduction of a referendum concerning the premature elections 
to the Seimas; and the Fatherland Association having made no 
such statement, but also making no plans so far to gather 
signatures), J. Tartilas said that "some imagine that one can be 
merely an observer, others are trying to latch on to something, 
are preparing programs." "However, I don't think that the cold 
status of an observer for the United Nations Organization is the 
best solution in this case," asserted the deputy chairman of the 
Democratic Party, J. Tartilas. 
  R. Smetona said he did not think that one should comment on 
the principles of the other opposition parties. He expressed his 
conviction that the active part of the society would actively 
join in the signature collection action. 
  Speaking about the results of the sociological polls, the 
leader of the Nationalist Association said that they did not 
predispose one for passivity or doing nothing. "The greatest 
crime and stupidity in this case is to do nothing, and such a 
position is absolutely unacceptable to us. The saying that 'we 
should wait until the idea of the early elections will ripen in 
the nation's depths and then we, politicians, will do 
something,' seems to lack seriousness for us. What will be the 
indication that the society has sufficiently matured already? We 
don't want this government to be swept away by force," R. 
Smetona said. 
  In J. Tartilas' opinion, the structure of the electorate has 
not changed: 40 percent have supported the rightist opposition, 
and the same percentage --the LDDP. The outcome of the election 
was decided by the remaining 20 percent. We are hopeful that 
those 20 percent -- they are mostly from the rural areas, and I 
would call them soviet kolkhoz serfs, have regained some of 
their eyesight and have started thinking. 
  A reminder: a proposal on early elections to the Seimas by 
26 
members of the Seimas representing the parliamentary opposition 
of the right was registered at the Seimas secretariat on April 
15 (meanwhile, there are 6 members of the Seimas in the 
Democratic Party and the Fatherland Association factions). But 
so far nobody has suggested that this proposal be put on the 
agenda of the Seimas sessions. 
  When asked to comment on this new initiative of the 
Democratic Party and the Nationalist Association, the chairman 
of the LDDP faction at the Seimas, Justinas Karosas, said that 
these parties are thus trying to draw attention to themselves, 
but that will help neither the state nor themselves. "I don't 
see what's so bad to require an early election," Justinas 
Karosas said.

<F P=106> [Article by Tomas Juknevicius: "The Labor Market; the </F>
Freezing of Natural Processes May Generate a Social Explosion"] 
  [Text] Sixty-six thousand fifty-six unemployed citizens 
looking for work were registered in Lithuania on May 1, 1994 
(their number was 68,002 at the beginning of last month), 
including 27,366 (28,547) official jobless individuals. 
Forty-six percent of the jobless were registered in the cities, 
and 54 percent in the districts. 
  The largest number of the jobless is in Vilnius 4,952 (5,031 
at the beginning of April) and Panevezys -- 1,910 (2,074), the 
fewest are in Marijampole --238 (261) and in Palanga -- 216 
(248). 
  The districts with the most jobless are Taurage -- about 1.8 
thousand people, and Silute -- 1.4 thousand. 
  The number of jobless workers keeps increasing in the 
country. On May 1, there were 65.7 percent of them (65.4 percent 
at the beginning of April). The number of jobless women remains 
stable (61.7 percent). 
  The level of unemployment and joblessness has changed little 
in the country, as compared with April 1: the level of 
unemployment -- 3.2 percent (it was the same at the beginning of 
April), and of joblessness -- 1.3 percent (1.4). 
  One available job in the country is sought by about 19 
people 
who are not working, and 8 jobless individuals. 
  The Lithuanian labor exchange's inquiries among the 
employers 
have revealed that at the beginning of May 120,000 people in 
this country worked an incomplete working day, not in their 
working place, were taking a compulsory vacation, or were about 
to be fired. 
  The president's adviser on questions of social economic 
policy, A. Vasiliauskas, told LIETUVOS RYTAS that hidden 
unemployment, which the official statistics pass over in 
silence, was entrenched in the country and was a negative 
phenomenon. Many enterprises avoided applying the Bankruptcy 
Law, because the people are paralyzed by psychological fear. On 
the other hand, procrastination might lead to a social explosion 
in the future. 
  V. Aleskaitis, the chairman of FIDA, a firm of the agency 
for 
the promotion of foreign investments, and the former minister of 
international economic relations, said that investors in 
Lithuania are not being scared away by the bastions of industry 
with thousands of workers drawing minimal wages. The serious 
investors may even find this unreally low level of unemployment 
attractive, but they immediately try to compute how fast it 
might rise in Lithuania. 
  "Instead of paying unemployment benefits and granting the 
right to seek work, people get minimal wages and are left with 
no prospects -- this is a faulty situation," V. Aleskaitis said. 
"The freezing of natural processes promotes a social explosion." 
  The director of the Vilnius labor exchange, J. Jagminas, 
asserted that this spring there was an increased demand for 
construction workers in the capital city. Other typical large 
city trends were also noticeable: fewer registered jobless and 
youths, more able-bodied people. The enterprises in the capital 
city have so far been reluctant to furnish the labor exchange 
with statistics about working at less than full capacity; by the 
way, directors of private enterprises in the Northern countries 
are acting in a similar manner.

<F P=106> [Article by ELTA: "Wages and Pensions in the Baltic </F>
Countries"] 
  [Text] Vilnius, May 4 (ELTA). The highest minimum wages in 
March -- 15 lats, or 26.32 U.S. dollars -- were noted in Latvia; 
the lowest -- 50 litas, or 12.73 U.S. dollars -- in Lithuania; 
in Estonia it was 300 kron, or 22.11 U.S. dollars, as reported 
to ELTA by the Department of Statistics at the Government of the 
Republic of Lithuania. During the year since March 1993, minimum 
wages have increased most in Lithuania -- 212.8 percent, in 
Latvia --200 percent, and in Estonia -- 100 percent. 
  There is less difference among the average wages, with 
additions, in these states; the lowest ones -- 1,165 kron, or 
85.86 U.S. dollars, in Estonia, somewhat higher -- 346.94 litas, 
or 88.30 U.S. dollars -- in Lithuania, and the highest -- 70.08 
lats, or 122.95 U.S. dollars, in Latvia. The annual average 
wages, with additions, have been increasing most rapidly in 
Lithuania -- 257.3 percent, in Latvia -- 148 percent, and in 
Estonia -- 145 percent. 
  There is almost no difference between the average old age 
pensions in Lithuania and in Estonia: 354 kron, or 26.09 U.S. 
dollars, in Estonia, and 103.81 litas, or 26.40 U.S. dollars, in 
Lithuania. In Latvia, this pension amounted to 24.82 lats, or 
43.54 U.S. dollars, in March.

<F P=106> [Article by Feliksas Telksnys: "The Ministry of the Interior </F>
Has Not Yet Promised a Peaceful Sleep"] 
  [Text] A session of the Seimas tonight will deal with the 
maintenance of law and order in Lithuania. Yesterday the members 
of the Seimas received materials prepared by the Ministry of the 
Interior, surveying the present state of criminality in 
Lithuania and attempting to predict the future. One member of 
the Seimas jested sadly that after these facts and forecasts, 
the average inhabitant of Lithuania might as well shoot himself, 
because otherwise he will be shot dead anyway. 
  Several numbers and facts. Seventeen thousand two hundred 
fifty-seven crimes were registered during the four months of 
this year. This is 20 percent less than during the same period 
in 1993. One hundred forty-four crimes are registered daily on 
the average, or 36 crimes less than last year. 
  The largest number of crimes for 10 thousand inhabitants has 
been registered in the cities of Neringa (74.1), Klaipeda 
(73.8), and Vilnius (60.3), and in the districts of Lazdijal 
(65.7), Kedainial (63) and Panevezys (62.3). 
  This year, every sixth registered crime was of a serious 
nature, last year it was every tenth one. The increase in 
serious crimes this year is linked with the increase of crimes 
of violence per person, in particular of intentional murders, 
robberies, public thefts. One hundred fifty-eight intentional 
murders were committed, there were 20 attempts at murder. This 
is, respectively, 61 intentional murders (62.9 percent) and 5 
attempts (33.3 percent) more than last year. Deliberate 
relatively grave bodily injuries have increased more than two 
times (from 97 to 207). 
  Every seventh stealing of citizens private property was 
accomplished by open theft or robbery (last year -- every ninth 
one). The number of robberies of private property has increased 
from 136 to 239, or by 75 percent, this year, as compared with 
1993. Twenty-four such crimes were registered during the four 
months of this year, while there were only 4 of them during the 
same period last year. 
  Firearms are being used more frequently in committing 
crimes. 
One hundred seven such crimes, or 11 cases more than last year, 
were registered during the four months of this year. Five cases 
of destruction of property or injury due to the use of explosive 
devices were registered each month, on the average. There was a 
total of 77 cases of deliberate destruction of property by way 
of arson. This is 36 cases, or 87 percent, more than last year. 
  Cases of violence against the citizens private property have 
increased almost three times this year: from 43 to 127. Ten 
cases of violence against state or public property were 
registered. No such cases were registered last year. 
  Cases of fraud have become more numerous. Two hundred 
seventy-five such cases of larceny involving citizens' private 
property, or 45.5 percent more than last year, have been 
registered. Fraud in the area of economy has become more 
frequent. Twenty-four cases of larceny by way of fraud involving 
state or public property were registered. This is six times more 
than in 1993. 
  This year, every sixth crime has been committed in public 
space (only every ninth one last year). Street crimes have 
increased in particular -- 36 percent more of them have been 
committed than in 1993. 
  The Ministry of the Interior forecasts that in view of the 
large quantities of illegal firearms and the relatively easy 
acquisition of explosives, the ratio of dangerous crimes per 
person shall increase as the consumption of alcohol and 
narcotics increases. 
  Considering the minimal level of wages paid to the employees 
of state institutions, a conclusion is made that corruption and 
abuse of the official positions will not decrease. 
  It is believed that because the frontiers are poorly 
controlled, the smuggling of narcotics and weapons should 
increase. 
  Thefts of automobiles are not likely to diminish, since this 
is a very profitable variety of criminal enterprise. 
  The Ministry of the Interior considers as its most important 
task the struggle against organized crime, the creation of a 
system for the prevention of crime and the violations of law, as 
well as the strengthening of the material base and the prestige 
of the police.

<F P=106> [Article by Neringa Jonusaite: "Lithuanian and Polish </F>
Television Cooperation Treaty Signed"] 
  [Text] A Lithuanian-Polish television cooperation treaty 
was signed yesterday at the Lithuanian state radio and 
television center. On the Polish side, it was signed by the 
chairman of the board of Poland's joint-stock TV company, W. 
Walendziak, and for Lithuania -- by the general director of 
radio and television, L. Tapinas. 
  The treaty was signed for three years. It provides for a 
broad cooperation between the televisions of the two countries, 
including an exchange of programs and technical equipment. The 
earlier treaty had expired in October of last year, but, as the 
director of the Lithuanian television, S. Sondeckis, told 
LIETUVOS RYTAS, the televisions of both countries continued 
their cooperation even in the absence of a treaty and the Polish 
TV provided Lithuanian TV with invaluable informational 
assistance. 
  Upon the signing of the treaty, the general director of 
Lithuanian radio and television, L. Tapinas, reminded that the 
Lithuanian RTV has signed cooperation treaties with the 
televisions of many European countries: "The treaty includes an 
item providing for a preparation of a special program in the 
Polish language by the Lithuanian television, and a similar 
program for Lithuanians in Poland by the Polish television. 
  W. Walendziak emphasized that this paragraph on the programs 
for the Polish and Lithuanian inhabitants was very important. 
The programs for Lithuanians in Poland are to be broadcast from 
a regional station in Warsaw; there are also plans to establish 
a regional station in Bialystok.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report concerning a 12-14 May 1994 roundtable </F>
meeting of scholars of the Russian Federation and Ukraine 
regarding the relations of the two countries: "Appeal"] 
  [Text] We, scholars of the Foreign Policy Research Center 
of the IMEPI [International Economic and Political Research 
Institute] of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the 
International Research Center of Odessa University, after 
assembling in Odessa on 12-14 May 1994 for a regular conference 
of the "Roundtable of Ukrainian and Russian Scholars," discussed 
the current state and outlook for Russian-Ukrainian relations 
and came to the following conclusions: 
  The struggle of two tendencies in the relations of our two 
countries--the moderate and the compromising, which is directed 
at the search for mutually acceptable resolutions--and the 
confrontational, which incites a further worsening of relations, 
is obviously turning out in favor of the latter. Relations are 
forming between Russia and Ukraine that are reminiscent of the 
"cold war," and a "war of nerves" is going on that is fraught 
with border disputes and interethnic clashes. 
  And this is at a time when an overwhelming part of the 
population of one and the other country is not experiencing 
hostility toward each other. 
  Moreover, the traditional friendly relations of the two 
peoples urgently require amicable interstate relations. 
  Political elites are competing between themselves who, as it 
seems to us, cannot find a common language by virtue of the 
obsession with imperial great power ambitions on the one hand, 
and the so-called "Pereyaslavl complex," with excessive fears 
regarding a threat to Ukrainian independence--on the other hand. 
  Under conditions of a lack of clear state rule from both 
sides, too great a force in the adoption of political decisions 
is acquired by the generals and admirals and their small but 
very active ultrapatriotic, chauvinist circles in both Russia 
and in Ukraine. 
  This threatens that the ruling state structures will lose 
control of the situation. It looks especially explosive in 
connection with the recent presidential elections in the Crimea, 
the provocative statements of Crimean President Meshkov and the 
position of the command of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Similar 
actions could cause a chain reaction of the further 
regionalization of Ukraine and Russia at best, and at worst--it 
could unleash a civil war. 
  We are categorically against the policy of the two countries 
being determined by generals and admirals among whose functions 
this does not fall. We are against the emergence of a "Crimean 
Zhirinovskiy" in Ukraine, and more specifically in the Crimea. 
  After considering numerous problems in Ukrainian-Russian 
relations, many of which have an undoubtedly objective 
character, in particular economic, international-legal, and 
culturological, we came to the conclusion that these problems 
are completely resolvable, given the competence, persistence, 
and tolerance of the sides. And the main thing: Given a clear 
realization of the desire to come to a mutually acceptable 
compromise by means of bilateral concessions that do not affect 
state sovereignty and the independence that was recently 
acquired by both sides. 
  During the course of our discussions, we coordinated the 
measure and volume of such concessions and are prepared to 
report them to the authoritative structures. 
  Being loyal citizens of both countries and at the same time 
professionals in the field of international relations, we 
caution the governments and the authoritative structures of both 
sides against playing with fire. The recent events in the area 
of Odessa were a striking example of the possible uncontrollable 
development of events. These kinds of incidents, given the 
current nature of authority in both countries, are entirely 
probable in the future as well. It is difficult to predict how 
local military authorities will behave in this case, just as it 
is difficult to predict the chain reaction of similar events. 
  At the same time, careful analysis of the foreign policy of 
both countries shows a real possibility not only of resolving 
bilateral problems, but also of effectively achieving an 
"international division of labor" in current international 
relations, in the resolution of problems of European security 
and relations with developing countries, in the resolution of 
problems of domestic and world economies and participation in 
joint international projects, and in the development of common 
positions in relations with the leading countries of the 
West--without unnecessary competition and ambitious political 
games of the ruling circles of Ukraine and Russia. 
  We view this appeal as a serious warning to the governments 
and public organizations of both countries, and we urgently 
request that it be taken into account in the preparation of 
decisions that affect the fundamental interests of Ukraine and 
Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Larisa Zelkova: "TV as One of the Local </F>
Attractions in Nizhniy Novgorod"] 
  [Text] It would be difficult to call this Russian 
city provincial, and not just because it is the birthplace of 
many famous people, it has a population of over a million, and 
its fair was famous even in the last century. Everything here is 
acquiring the dimensions of a capital. This applies to the motor 
vehicle plant and to the submarine engineering facilities. As 
for television broadcasting, Nizhniy Novgorod has more 
broadcasting companies than most cities. There are several 
reasons for this unique situation, and it is significant that 
the broadcasting industry in Nizhniy Novgorod is a paradigm of 
the one in Moscow. 
<H5>  Reason One: How One State TV Broadcasting Company Turned </H5>
into Two 
  The story of this division began, as most stories do, with a 
confrontation. The creative team in the oblast studio split into 
two camps. One group called themselves patriots and refused to 
"sell out," while the members of the other group were more 
likely to act on purely materialistic interests. When Mikhail 
Poltoranin from Moscow decided a year and a half ago to open 
local branches of the Federal Television Broadcasting Company, 
this provided a way of resolving the conflict. Today it is clear 
that it may not have been the best way. Imitating a single-cell 
amoeba, the labor collective split into two halves: an oblast 
team and a federal team. Each received its own chunk of air 
time. They divided the days up evenly, so that no one would be 
slighted. This created an unusual, overlapping program schedule: 
The new oblast studio took Monday, Thursday, and Friday, leaving 
the other four days at the disposal of the new federal company. 
  Many believed that this paradoxical division was possible 
only because there was always enough "watchable" TV here. The 
film editing division alone, which made excellent documentaries, 
was good enough for several oblast studios. Director Olga 
Noskova of the Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast Studio is certain that 
the uniqueness of the situation was due to one unusual feature: 
The television broadcasting center in Nizhniy Novgorod is a 
leased enterprise and was not dependent on any existing company. 
  "The director of our television center could be called a 
legend in his own time.... He was the one who displayed 
impressive persistence and consistency in solving the problem. 
If he had not done this, we would have had the same situation as 
in other regions. We would have been the poor relatives of 
non-government companies. The television broadcasting center is 
a monopolist, but it does not concern itself with industry 
politics. It serves everyone--as long as they all pay their 
bills," Noskova explained. 
  Now the two competing companies have been joined by a third 
force, a quite independent and strong force. The leased TV 
broadcasting center dared to treat all of its clients equally, 
and some of them categorically objected to this. 
  The management of the federal company is convinced that the 
issue of property has to be settled. "Look how they managed to 
get the technical equipment away from us!" This is what makes 
the chairman of the federal "Nizhniy Novgorod Broadcasting 
Company" furious. Of course, the people in his studio want the 
issue to be resolved in only one way: They want title to the 
broadcasting center and are implying that no one else is 
entitled to use the equipment and the premises. 
  Incidentally, there is more than enough unequivocal 
animosity 
in the relations between the two broadcasting companies. Olga 
Noskova, director of the oblast TV studio, has another opinion: 
"The problem of the federal company has to be solved by 
eliminating it. I could talk to them about unification, but only 
in one sense: Guys, give us your air time and we will find 
something to fill it with." 
  The resulting situation is fascinating in several respects. 
The groundlessness of the federal company's insistent refusal to 
"sell out" was confirmed by subsequent events: They are now 
hunting for advertisers just as eagerly as the oblast studio and 
are starting to show the same "disgraceful box-office hits and 
other bourgeois trash" as the other studio. Their competitors in 
the oblast studio, however, have already had time to learn the 
ways of commerce, and advertisers are more likely to do business 
with them. 
  In general, it is a peculiar situation. A single channel 
shows the programs of one company for three days a week and the 
programs of another company the rest of the time. Both want to 
destroy the competition and are basing their long-range plans on 
precisely this outcome, which would be beneficial for only one 
side. Everyone realizes that it is ridiculous to divide up the 
program schedule in this way. The viewers do not want to have to 
remember the specific days of the week that belong to each 
company, and they do not remember: They call the oblast company 
to complain about the mistakes of the federal company, and vice 
versa. This is not surprising: The programs of the competing 
former colleagues are so similar.... And this is also 
understandable: After all, they all worked together for such a 
long time to establish the television industry in Nizhniy 
Novgorod. 
  This overlapping schedule is not particularly agreeable to 
the administrators or the journalists. The journalists know that 
something momentous might happen in Nizhniy Novgorod that day, 
but their company will not have any air time until the next day. 
The news services of the competing companies are naturally 
independent of one another--and, it seems, independent of the 
viewers, who might have to watch virtually identical reports two 
days in a row, because all of the reporters cover the same beat. 
  In any country with a technical rating system, the question 
of viewer preference is never left unanswered. We, on the other 
hand, have only the pathetic results of sociological surveys, 
and they can only be used to inform a competitor as loudly as 
possible: "Nobody watches your programs anyway!" 
  Their relative merits will become apparent with the passage 
of time. 
<H5>  Reason Two: It Takes a Pioneer </H5>
  The first non-governmental broadcasting company in Nizhniy 
Novgorod, the "N-N Network," does not have to wonder if anyone 
watches its programs. The company does not have a channel of its 
own yet. It leases air time on Sundays from the federal studio 
and for two hours in the morning on weekdays from the "Rossiya" 
Network. The network's colleagues have different opinions of it. 
They all acknowledge its boldness. It dares to do all kinds of 
things with no regard whatsoever for politics. Company President 
Mikhail Lerman had this to say about the absence of political 
programming on his schedule: "As soon as political programs get 
popular, we will make political programs." This lack of concern 
about politics might be the reason that all of the sociological 
polls indicate that a high percentage of the people in Nizhniy 
Novgorod are watching the "N-N Network" on Sundays. 
  It would be odd if they were not watching it. There is no 
commentary at all, and there are many Western movies, 
mini-series, and entertainment programs, half of which the 
company produces itself. In general, the "N-N" team has several 
interesting principles of operation, and they always act on 
them. At some point the people at the "N-N Network" realized 
that they had to have something of their own. They have their 
own editing room and their own equipment. When company President 
Mikhail Lerman was asked what kind of equipment they had, his 
answer was quite simple: "Anything that is not essential is not 
necessary. That is another of our principles of operation. We do 
not buy ultra-modern equipment, because neither today's 
businessman nor the present viewing audience is demanding 
ultra-high quality." The company's policies are distinguished by 
pragmatism and expediency. These qualities are in short supply 
today. 
  The "N-N Network" was the first in Nizhniy Novgorod to begin 
buying licensed products. It has accumulated an impressive 
library of films, and as soon as the other companies in the city 
begin showing licensed programs, it will broadcast only the 
films it acquired legally. The company administrators feel that 
the "N-N Network" should not have to pay for something that the 
others get virtually for free. This situation requires an 
explanation. 
  Local TV studios in virtually every part of Russia are 
broadcasting nothing but stolen films. No one is paying 
royalties to anyone. There are two reasons for this. Most of the 
firms in our country that are claiming the rights to bourgeois 
films do not really own the rights. Since there are no 
legitimate representatives, it appears that there is no one to 
pay. Furthermore, our companies still cannot afford to pay the 
fees that are accepted in the rest of the world. They are too 
poor. 
  It would be difficult, however, to call the "N-N Network" 
poor. Everything there looks wonderful to an outsider. This 
company acquired the regional rights to CNN and MTV telecasts by 
paying for them. They feel it is always better to pay their way, 
and this is another of the company's principles of operation. 
  It has accomplished a great deal on the local TV scene since 
1985: It was the first to interrupt programs to show 
commercials, the first to hold advertising fairs, the first to 
organize "Night Flight"--special programming for night owls, and 
the first to film commercials for local advertisers. The "N-N 
Network" staffers were the only ones smart enough to get 
on-the-job training at CNN, which even showed the story of an 
"N-N Network" trainee on its international news channel. 
<H5>  Reason Three: Where the "Volga" Flows </H5>
  The "Volga" channel is not even a year old. It had the 
simplest beginnings imaginable. A few people decided to start a 
book-publishing business a few years ago. It was a success. Then 
they started publishing their own newspapers. They ended up with 
"Kuryer," a whole publishing house. A little later they got a 
broadcasting license and "Rendezvous Radio" came into being. 
With this experience in taking on so many projects successfully, 
some of them decided to go into television. They used the same 
method as before: They got a broadcasting license, their own 
transmitter, and their own equipment--not the best, but good 
enough for a start. Six private individuals and one firm acted 
as the co-founders. It was a success. 
  The story of this company's quick rise is surprisingly 
simple 
and essentially ordinary. The principle of "doing something 
different from everything else on TV in Nizhniy Novgorod" worked 
perfectly. That is why the image of the "Volga" channel is more 
youthful and audacious than mature and wise. Young people were 
hired to make all of the programs--kids from 16 to 22. They did 
some incredible things on the air in the beginning, but we have 
a tolerant viewing audience. Everyone knew that these young 
people had to learn their job and that they could only learn by 
trial and error. It goes without saying that each day they tried 
more and erred less. 
  The boys and girls who were literally taken off the street 
immediately started making their own programs about the most 
diverse and extremely serious topics. Now anyone who has been 
working there for more than half a year is already an 
"old-timer." During the first six months the company moved away 
from the usual kind of programming and began to produce its own 
shows. Two children's series could be regarded as a genuine 
accomplishment. Once some young staffers filmed a whole 
children's play with just one home video camera. There were many 
things about the program that could have offended the eye of a 
professional, but this was a show for children, and it was a 
very good one. 
  Another of "Volga's" indisputable achievements is its own 
sports programming. I do not know of any oblast studios that 
show the soccer matches of local teams.... The "Volga" staffers 
have even made their own tourist magazine show, with the same 
young staffers making films in Gorkiy Oblast. There is also some 
political commentary, but the company administrators learned 
long ago that political programs do not bring in enough 
advertising revenue. Advertisers are more eager to show their 
commercials during horror movies and erotic films.... 
  The number of members of the "Volga" creative team can be 
counted on one's fingers. Each one is a jack-of-all-trades. Each 
can film a show, edit it, and broadcast it. Maybe everything has 
gone so well because these young "TV experts" (what else can we 
call them?) have never experienced abject failure. They 
fearlessly take on anything new. They have nothing to fear but 
their own commercial failure. Remember the old adage about the 
destructive power of the predictable? The youngest people in the 
television industry in Nizhniy Novgorod know better than their 
senior colleagues how this principle works. They have all of the 
necessary knowledge and ability. These children have a great 
future ahead of them. These boys and girls have already learned 
to do their job and to take responsibility for what they do. 
This is valued in any social structure and in any profession. 
  ...Everyone knows that the Volga flows into the Caspian Sea. 
No one knows where this "Volga" will be in a few years. 
<H5>  Reason Four: The Zverev Brand of TV </H5>
  There are many women on television. There are few successful 
women on television. Nina Zvereva, the Rossiya Network's 
personal correspondent in the Nizhniy Novgorod region, is unique 
in this respect and in many others. Her reports from Nizhniy 
Novgorod are always distinguishable from the work of other 
journalists. Nina Zvereva has perfected her own special brand of 
TV coverage. 
  They like her in Nizhniy Novgorod. She is well-known in 
Moscow. Nina Zvereva manages to combine the best features of 
provincialism with the sophistication of the capital. Zvereva 
herself feels that she was just lucky in guessing what the 
viewer in Nizhniy Novgorod wanted from her. "People do not care 
what I am talking about. All they want is for me to assure them 
that everything is fine, that life goes on. I even feel 
something like a minister...," Nina explained. 
  Her news bureau was the Rossiya Network's first independent 
agency. She managed to put together a set of good professional 
equipment. When company Chairman Oleg Poptsov, who had to 
approve her requisitions, asked Broadcasting Director Anatoliy 
Lysenko with amazement why all of the equipment was going to 
Nizhniy Novgorod, Anatoliy Grigoryevich had a simple response: 
"Because Nina Zvereva lives in Nizhniy Novgorod...." 
  At the start of her TV career, Zvereva had to wear two hats: 
In Moscow she was a provincial, and in Nizhniy Novgorod she was 
a representative of the capital's values. "Then I realized that 
my image, my appeal, my individuality stemmed from my provincial 
nature. I knew that a Muscovite could not succeed here anyway. 
After all, they do not know anything." Nina, now confident of 
her own strengths, recalled her early days in the business. At 
one time she worked for the children's programming department of 
the Central Television Network, taking her best Nizhniy Novgorod 
programs to Moscow, but she found that they were not appreciated 
in the capital. 
  There have been many changes since then. Now Zvereva is a 
chief executive. She always knows what to send to Moscow and 
what to show on her only program on oblast TV--"Video Library." 
Relying on her own judgments, Nina Zvereva is almost never 
mistaken--about people or about situations. First-rate cameraman 
Mikhail Sladkov works with her. She has been able to find the 
most committed people for her news bureau, perhaps because she 
is also wholly committed to her job. She has trouble taking it 
easy on the weekend and has to conceal her eagerness to get back 
to work from her husband. 
  It was the same sense of commitment that made Zvereva open 
her school of television arts. At first Nina thought this was a 
good way of starting a business of her own and making money. As 
soon as the students arrived, however, she was hesitant: It 
would have been like taking money from her own children. 
  The school already has several graduates. Each puts an 
additional workload on Zvereva's news bureau, because all of her 
students later come back to the bureau for advice on their own 
reports. At this time Zvereva and Sladkov are teaching beginners 
in television: Rayon TV studios are being opened in Nizhniy 
Novgorod Oblast and they need personnel. 
  What Nina Zvereva would like to do is to teach 
correspondents 
for the Rossiya Television Network in Nizhniy Novgorod. After 
all, it would be impossible to teach people in Moscow to work in 
the provinces. She wants the school to have its own good 
professional equipment and a nice building in the middle of the 
city. I am quite certain that she will have all of this someday. 
Nina Zvereva knows how to get what she needs. 
<H5>  Reason Five: How the Governor Governs </H5>
  There is another possible explanation for the uniqueness of 
the television industry in Nizhniy Novgorod: Officials here are 
distinguished by a particularly democratic style of 
administration and do not exasperate broadcasters with stupid 
regulations or try to keep journalists on a leash. Boris 
Nemtsov, the Nizhniy Novgorod governor who is well-known all 
over Russia, has his own ideas about the development of 
television broadcasting in the region and, consequently, his own 
preferences. After all, the governor is also a member of the 
viewing audience. 
  "No one has to give me any reports on TV broadcasting--no 
oral or written reports. I have always supported independent 
television. Furthermore, I have no wish to issue orders to the 
TV stations. 
  "My colleagues frequently reproach me for giving interviews 
to journalists who always criticize me, but there are no 
journalists with exclusive status in my office. A reporter from 
any station can come to me and ask me any questions at all, even 
the most unpleasant ones." 
  "How do you envision TV broadcasting in Nizhniy Novgorod in 
the future?" 
  "In general, our case is unprecedented in provincial Russia. 
They say that no other place has so many different broadcasting 
companies. Now they are starting to compete with one another. 
Obviously, someone is bound to defeat someone else. My job is to 
prevent monopolization without interfering. If someone on the 
highest level decides to herd everyone back into a common stable 
again and to appoint a general administrator, I will object, but 
if one company defeats another in competition, I will tell the 
loser that he must not have been doing his job well.... 
  "It seems to me that the companies with the greatest 
prospects are not the ones in Nizhniy Novgorod, but the ones in 
the cities and rural communities of the oblast that we are just 
opening now. I am certain that the emergence of these 
broadcasting companies is a step toward the civic society. It 
means that people are acknowledging their common features to 
some extent and are realizing that they have common problems. I 
hope we will have our own broadcasting companies in all of the 
rayons before I have to leave office." 
<H5>  In Lieu of a Sixth Reason: You Have To Know What Life Is </H5>
Like in Nizhniy Novgorod 
  The situation in Nizhniy Novgorod is unique in other 
respects 
as well. For some reason, people of different specialties regard 
this Russian city as the test site for their social and economic 
experiments. This was the site of the first organized 
privatization program and the first auction in Russia for the 
sale of land to the peasants. Imagine that!... Now trainees in 
the TV industry can come here for experience, and I will not be 
surprised if some of them decide to stay at one of these four 
extremely promising TV broadcasting companies.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Voloshina: "Is MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS </F>
Buying CHAS PIK?"] 
  [Text] CHAS PIK, St. Petersburg's main weekly, intends to 
turn over a large package of its stock to the capital's 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS newspaper. In view of the different 
images of these two publications, the symbiosis seems rather 
odd: In St. Petersburg CHAS PIK claims to be the "newspaper of 
the intelligentsia." 
  As President Anatoliy Yezhelev of the Chas Pik Publishing 
House, a joint-stock company, told the MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI 
correspondent, the weekly, like other newspapers in St. 
Petersburg, is under considerable financial strain: "The 
newspaper needs a sound investor to move up to a new qualitative 
level, and this could take hundreds of millions of rubles." CHAS 
PIK plans to begin by becoming a daily newspaper and attracting 
advertising revenue. 
  Anatoliy Yezhelev explained that the talks with MOSKOVSKIY 
KOMSOMOLETS had just begun, and that the discussion concerned 
the creation of a joint news and commercial service in St. 
Petersburg and Moscow. As the MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent 
later learned, however, MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has already been 
offered a package of CHAS PIK stock at face value by one of the 
weekly's main shareholders--the UniREM joint venture. Other 
shareholders--two city banks and the St. Petersburg Union of 
Journalists--own a negligible percentage of the stock. The main 
stockholders are the members of the newspaper labor collective. 
The CHAS PIK journalists told the MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI 
correspondent that persistent attempts were being made to force 
them to sign a "quit-claim" to their employee stock. Many 
members of the collective have already signed papers of this 
kind, possibly in the fear of administrative penalties. Only a 
few have refused, and they want to know why MOSKOVSKIY 
KOMSOMOLETS was chosen as the investor and what kind of policies 
it intends to pursue after it gets the controlling share of the 
stock. Anatoliy Yezhelev explained the choice of MOSKOVSKIY 
KOMSOMOLETS as a matter of pure ethics: "We received extremely 
tempting bids for our stock from large financial corporations, 
but we do not want to fall under the influence of the banks--we 
would rather deal with our journalist colleagues."

<F P=106> [Article by I. Medina, chief of the Subdivision for the </F>
Development of New Economic and Financial Structures of Russia's 
Ministry of Economics: "Between the Past and the Future"] 
  [Text] Today, in order not to be bogged down in the 
current chaos of events and to select the correct direction and 
key positions for a systematic implementation of advanced 
economic policy, it is necessary to become aware of the 
objective cause-and-effect relationship and direction of the 
global processes that have shaken our country's economy. 
  It must be admitted that the dying away of investment 
processes was the main reason for the downfall of the 
administration and command economic system. The existing scheme 
for distributing investment resources and bringing them to the 
investment process came into conflict with the scale and 
complexity of the serviced system and became an obstacle to 
expanded reproduction and further economic development. The 
continuation of its vital activity led to the fact that the 
system ate itself away, thereby destroying its future, that is, 
the future of the next generations. All of us know well the 
symptoms of this: inefficiency, total deficit, corruption, and 
so forth. 
  Thus, the need for a fundamental change in the system from 
the standpoint of providing new opportunities for its economic 
growth was the objective reality. First of all, this implies the 
birth of a new scheme for the functioning of investment 
resources in it and for the appearance of new subjects of the 
investment process. 
  Attempts at cosmetic corrections through the introduction of 
cost-accounting elements into the old system could only delay 
the necessary changes and aggravate the process. 
  The transformations begun in the economic sphere in 1992, 
which were connected mainly with the transformation of property 
relations and included price liberalization, privatization, 
demonopolization of the economy, and so forth, in the end were 
supposed to serve the establishment of the necessary base for 
investments from the standpoint of the formation of their 
subjects. Real results in this area are quite tangible and do 
not need additional comments. 
  Costs in the course of practical implementation of the 
presented directions were largely due to the fact that at the 
moment of the break-up of and impossibility for creative labor 
flaws and processes serving the goals of destruction in any 
system, that is, money-grubbing, corruption, group and 
individual egoism, crime, and so forth, were manifested in 
hypertrophied form. 
  As a result, in the absence of rational control of processes 
a situation has been created, in which the economic system is 
being destroyed to a level exceeding the limits of its viability. 
  This is expressed in the fact that the economic crisis 
experienced by the country is characterized by a decline in 
production and by a scale of destruction of the economy 
unprecedented in their depth. In the last 4 years the general 
decrease in production has approached 50 percent of the mark and 
in individual sectors the decline has reached 70 percent. There 
is an especially difficult situation in science-intensive 
sectors of industry, which are the basis for present economic 
growth. The rapid drop in competitiveness of Russian industrial 
output, destruction of cooperative ties and technological chains 
in the manufacture of complex types of products, and increase in 
the export of raw-material goods with a reduction in the export 
of goods with a high degree of processing point to the growing 
trend toward the country's deindustrialization and 
transformation of the Russian economy into a raw-material 
periphery of the world market. 
  However, the main danger lies in the fact that an 
uncontrolled complete stoppage of production processes can 
entail, as a minimum, the elimination of the viability of entire 
cities and even regions. It is a question of fully civilian 
sectors, beginning with the textile industry and so forth. At 
present the maintenance and normal functioning of the social 
infrastructure serving the population can be ensured only at the 
expense of operating enterprises. Mass unemployment and poverty 
as a direct consequence of the indicated process can serve as 
the basis not only for a sharp rise in crime, but also for a 
powerful social explosion, which will eliminate any opportunity 
for revival. Furthermore, the fact that in a number of cases 
production stoppage requires procedures for a reliable 
suspension of technological processes should be kept in mind. 
Taking into account the scale of the possible process, the state 
does not have funds for these purposes. As a result, there is a 
real threat of ecological disasters. 
  Our task is to avoid such a tragic development of events! 
The 
uniqueness of the moment is that at present the scale of the 
calamity has not yet acquired an irreversible nature. However, 
the fact that it is still possible to embark on a steady path of 
progressive development of the national economy is the chief 
thing. 
  Confidence in this is based on existing--with respect to a 
number of questions still in the form of concepts--new 
approaches to the economic policy of the postprivatization 
period developed by specialists of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Economics with the participation of practical 
workers and scientists. 
  The essence of the proposed measures lies in the following: 
  1. It is necessary to carry out work on the determination of 
priorities of structural policy. At the same time, as the basic 
goal-oriented task it is necessary to utilize, on the one hand, 
the demand for the preservation and support of advanced 
technologies and, on the other, the inevitable suspension of 
especially harmful and ecologically dangerous backward 
technologies. 
  Only by promoting advanced technical thought and destroying 
and rendering obsolete technological processes harmless, can we 
hope to bring about a new technological spurt and on this basis 
to hold a leading place in the world economic community. 
  It is this process that should form the basis, in the first 
case, for investment projects developing and strengthening 
existing production and, in the second, for investment projects 
servicing procedures for clearing up finances. 
  2. It is necessary to bring the formation of the base for 
the 
implementation of investment processes to conclusion with a view 
to ensuring the transfer of enterprises into the hands of 
individuals, who carry out on the basis of guarantees 
responsible management of the property transferred to them, 
thereby ensuring at enterprises a transition to a management 
regime stimulating a real saving of expenditures. 
  Without this the launching of any investment project is a 
utopia and a deliberately inefficient expenditure of funds. 
  The process of transition to responsible management can be 
carried out: 
  --through the transfer of rights of ownership of the managed 
facility to a real, not washed away, owner, for whom the 
investment attractiveness of a given enterprise is already 
obvious and who is prepared to carry out investment activity, at 
the same time, becoming its "efficient" owner. The 
responsibility of the indicated individuals for an efficient 
development of investment processes should be ensured by a 
sufficient amount of capital invested by them in a given 
enterprise. 
  For this purpose it is necessary to think out procedures for 
investment bids and for secondary emission of privatization 
enterprises, as well as for privatization for money; 
  --through the transfer of property for responsible 
management 
to individuals carrying out investment activity at enterprises 
in the process of clearing up their finances under conditions of 
strictly regulated responsibility for the results obtained. 
  In this case there is a need for a legislative base ensuring 
the regulation of procedures for responsibility and the 
conditions of its occurrence. 
  3. For the purpose of determining real sources and volumes 
of 
available state investment resources, it is necessary to 
reexamine the distribution of budget funds assigned for the 
realization of investment policy and to provide for their 
allocation strictly on the goal-oriented programmed principle 
according to the established priorities of economic 
restructuring. 
  Taking into consideration that today large national private 
capitals and funds of foreign investors are drawn into the 
investment process with great caution and that it is naive to 
count on their mass inflow until a really existing favorable 
investment climate is created, it is necessary to pay special 
attention to the population's funds accumulated in various kinds 
of accumulating organizations--mainly check investment funds, 
nonstate pension funds, and so forth. 
  With regard to check investment funds we must realize that 
the system of accumulation of the population's funds with 
mandatory current payments established on their basis at present 
under conditions of inflation and the economic crisis does not 
meet the constructive goals of its establishment--to be the 
social guarantor for the population. 
  In order to survive, in a short time funds must be 
transformed from the apparatus of accumulation and 
redistribution of privatization rights in the form of vouchers 
into a mechanism of an efficient redistribution of real capital. 
  In all cases, only by servicing real social needs and being 
oriented toward the population's vital interests, not by getting 
off with current handouts, can accumulating organizations of any 
type and direction acquire a long-term perspective for their 
activity. 
  4. As the main factor permeating the entire investment 
infrastructure, it is necessary to apply the new scheme for 
bringing investment resources to their direct consumers. Under 
existing conditions of inflation and the decline in production 
currently existing channels--direct investments and investment 
credit--cannot launch the investment process. 
  Direct investments as a system are not fully justified from 
the standpoint of attaining some efficiency. With regard to 
investment credits, under the existing procedure of their 
allocation, first, they differ little from any other forms of 
distribution of "cheap" state funds and, second, are a direct 
channel for forcing the inflationary flow. The lack in the 
country of investment banks with strict restrictions on the 
performance of any other, except investment, operations under 
conditions of the difference--incomparable in profitability--in 
credit servicing of various spheres of activity inevitably 
pushes funds, which are allocated through the credit system for 
investment purposes, into the sphere of financial, trade, and 
any other business affording the opportunity to obtain a higher, 
even to the smallest degree, norm of profit. Thereby, the more 
funds for good investment purposes we allocate through the 
credit system, the bigger the inflation spiral that we will 
eventually get. 
  In this connection the scheme of portfolio investments is 
the 
only way of bringing investment resources to investment 
processes without system losses. It is necessary to establish a 
system of state guarantees for private investments on the basis 
of the use of stock market tools, because the stock market is 
the main regulator of investment processes in a market-oriented 
economy and can reliably protect funds allocated in such a way 
against nonpurposeful use. 
  Establishing and developing a liquid market of securities 
with state guarantees issued for real investment processes, we 
will be able to initiate the inflow of funds of private 
investors (including the population). The indicated approach was 
discussed on pages of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN, No 14 of this year. 
Therefore, we will not further dwell on its description. 
  The nature of the present state of the stock market, which 
fully reflects all the problems of the national economy, 
confirms the need to turn to it as to the key tool of 
implementation of state investment policy. 
  On the whole, describing Russia's stock market in 1994, the 
crisis unpredictability of its development on the threshold of 
the voucher's departure from the arena of actions should be 
recognized. 
  This is evident from the increasing volume of proposals and 
rise in the rate of highly risky and unreliable securities. 
Attention should also be drawn to the emerging tendency toward 
the expanded practice of emission of promissory notes by 
commercial banks. In essence, this signifies an additional 
uncontrolled monetary emission, which can successfully service 
settlements among subjects and blow up monetary circulation in 
the country, which is undermined as it is. The intentions of 
local authorities in a number of regions, whose finances have 
been affected by the nonpayment crisis, to accept bank 
promissory notes as tax payments and to pay for their own 
expenditures with them are the symptom of this. 
  On the part of the state a feverish, unsuccessful search for 
a financial tool capable of replacing the voucher on the stock 
market and of saturating exchange turnovers with a mass liquid 
and reliable security continues on the part of the state. 
Experiments with the gold certificate and state treasury bonds 
do not yet give the proper result. 
  The obvious inadequacy of the legislative base, which 
regulates the activity and development of the stock market and 
guarantees the property rights of private investors, who are 
owners of securities, creates the possibility for unprecedented 
deceptions of the population and dirty speculations. 
  In order to prevent a future crisis on the stock market 
under 
these conditions, it is necessary to carry out the intervention 
of part of the budget funds, which are intended for the 
investment replenishment of the economy, in the establishment of 
a liquid stock exchange on the basis of securities guaranteed by 
the state and connected with real investment processes, in which 
the state is interested. In contrast to the credit mechanism of 
investments, a preferential use of the stock market mechanism 
for these purposes under present conditions gives three 
significant advantages: 
  --the rate of turnover of invested funds increases sharply; 
  --a recoverable nature of investments is guaranteed, because 
securities for investment projects purchased by the state with 
its shareholding are transferred to government agents, who are 
responsible for the realization of a given project, for 
responsible management with the right of their sale or option. 
In this case securities with state guarantees through stock 
market channels can be gradually placed among small investors, 
or will be transferred to the ownership of the indicated private 
structure as an investor; 
  --the return on investments increases, because the mechanism 
of the stock market automatically, on a fair competitive basis, 
ensures the selection and financing of the most profitable 
investment projects. 
  The following can be specific stock market tools, which 
realize state guarantees for investment projects with state 
shareholding: 
  --shares with guarantees of buyout or the payment of 
dividends for specific technologies depending on the periods of 
realization and other characteristics of the project. Such a 
variant can be envisaged in case of the realization of a new or 
the development of an already existing technological process; 
  --promissory notes with a regulated recording procedure and 
a 
discount rate guaranteed by means of a certain regulation. These 
kinds of schemes can be used in case of the realization of 
investment projects connected with the clearing up of finances 
at enterprises. It must be stated that the first tests in this 
direction are already being performed. In April Russia's 
Ministry of Finance began the preparation of the output and 
organization of a secondary circulation of a new state 
security--the state treasury bill. 
  The development of the transparency of the stock market, 
which is connected primarily with an improvement in the 
operation of stock exchanges both on a professional plane and 
from the standpoint of their technical support, is the most 
important and necessary component of success of the proposed 
approach. 
  5. The proposed concept of state investment policy should be 
realized by giving wide powers, which also presuppose increased 
responsibility, to organizers of investment processes as 
represented by nonstate structures--government agents 
establishing their guaranteed funds on the basis of state 
guarantees. The essence of these powers can lie in the right to 
choose specific investment projects of commercial interest 
within the framework of investment programs approved by the 
government according to the priorities of structural policy. 
  In order to ensure state guarantees in the form presented 
above, along with the use of funds allocated from the budget for 
investment purposes, it will be necessary to include the 
resources of Russia's Central Bank as an insurance reserve for 
the coverage of possible losses. The indicated credit could be 
determined in the ratio of 10:1 with respect to the total amount 
of security obligations guaranteed by the state. 
  The state should guarantee responsibility for a successful 
realization of an investment project not to its organizer and 
direct implementer, but to persons attracted as passive 
investors, who have entrusted their funds to this process. A 
government agent should undertake the remaining responsibility 
and, accordingly, guarantees in exchange for the powers 
delegated to him. 
  The multiplicative effect of guaranteed securities, when 
everyone along the vertical line, beginning with the state and 
ending with commercial banks, begins to act as a guarantor, is 
possible only on this basis. The formation of rational and 
efficient financial and industrial groups concentrated around 
the investment process and assuming their share of 
responsibility is possible only on this basis. 
  6. For the purpose of a complete realization of the 
expressed 
approaches, which excludes distortions, it is necessary to carry 
out significant preparatory work on the establishment of the 
necessary legislative base, primarily on problems of setting 
rules of responsibility for actions carried out within the 
framework of the indicated processes and of the conditions of 
its onset. 
  It is necessary to work out legislative norms regulating 
responsible management of property (not its transfer to 
trusteeship), implying by this all possible variants and objects 
of management. 
  The urgency of such a formulation is determined by the fact 
that the sufficiency of guarantees in any case, with the 
exception of the state, is ensured primarily by strong judicial 
and legal protection based on existing legislation. The solution 
of the problem at the level of subordinate legislation is not 
sufficient as a legislative base during court examination. In 
this connection it is a matter of the development of an entire 
package of legislative acts with the indicated direction. 
  In conclusion it must be said that any of the proposed 
schemes can be doomed to failure if we, each of us, do not 
realize that only by treating the matter from the standpoint of 
responsibility, not personal mercenary interest, only by feeling 
personal responsibility for our country's future, will we be 
able to build a new society worthy of our children. 
  We have no other choice!

<F P=106> [Article by V.L. Perlamutrov, corresponding member of </F>
Russian Academy of Economic Sciences, doctor of economic 
sciences, professor, and deputy director of the Market Problems 
Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences: "Reforming the 
Central Bank: Financial-Economic and Political Aspects"] 
  [Text] A message from the president of the Russian 
Federation spoke of the need for reformation of the Central Bank 
of Russia, the ultimate aim of which was the creation of a 
federal reserve system. How do the reformers envisage the 
Central Bank? For the time being it is not clear--there is no 
precisely formulated concept. One thing is clear--the process of 
reform will be under the president's control. In an interview by 
our newspaper (BIZNES I BANKI No 17, 1994), F.Ya. Livshits, 
director of a presidential group of experts, called upon the 
Central Bank of Russia, scholars, and bankers to express their 
opinion on the subject of their vision of a new banking system 
for our country. Before posing the problem of converting the 
Central Bank of Russia to a federal reserve system, however, the 
status and authority of the Federation's constituents should 
obviously be determined. This opinion was expressed by those 
participating in an applied science seminar (Moscow, 14 April 
this year) at which a number of problems related to reforming 
Russian banking systems were discussed. It was organized by the 
Market Problems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 
the Energiya Association of Independent Commercial Banks, and 
the newspaper BIZNES I BANKI. We offer for our readers' 
attention the speeches of the seminar participants. 
  We have just heard the ideas of F.Ya. Livshits, doctor of 
economic science. I have the impression that these are not the 
thoughts of a financier, or a loan officer, or a money 
specialist, but of an economist in general. The question right 
now is really not whether the president does or does not need to 
issue a document on organizing financial-industrial groups--this 
is a matter for a different level of managing the economy. It is 
a question of something quite different, above all, of the 
processes in the entire financial-economic sphere. The main 
thing is that, after all, we are not simply bringing about a 
reform, we are in a profound economic crisis. Industrial 
production has dropped by 60 percent, agricultural--by 
one-third, and putting new production funds into 
operation--almost 100-fold. This is not simply an economic 
crisis, it is the collapse of the country's economy. Even the 
crisis in the American economy at the beginning of the 1930's 
was a lesser one. Now they tell us that a "constriction" of 
Russian industry has taken place. The Russian language is a 
splendid language, and one can find many synonyms for any 
concept, but the word "constriction" in no way corresponds to 
the concept "crash." 
  As a result of Gaydar's reforms, the Russian economy has 
arrived at a state in which it soon may not need any banking 
system at all. It will either function in a regime like the 
economy of "militant communism," when it has no need at all for 
either a banking or a monetary system, but needs a Gosplan, 
Gossnab, etc., or it will arrive at a state of utter chaos. 
  There has never been a situation in the 20th century when in 
peacetime, in an industrially developed country, production has 
dropped on such a scale. In the report which we heard from the 
director of the group of experts affiliated with the Russian 
Federation president, however, he speaks, in such calm academic 
tones, about converting the Central Bank of Russia to a federal 
reserve system of the type that exists in the United States. 
Generally speaking, this sort of structure for central banks is 
characteristic of large countries--the United States, Germany, 
India. This is possible, however, when the situation in the 
national economy is more or less stable. It is highly doubtful 
that, with a general crisis in the national economy, the problem 
of reorganizing the central bank into a federal reserve system 
should appear as top-priority. 
  Many regional organs of authority are actively coming out in 
favor of reorganizing the Central Bank of Russia into a federal 
system. They picture each oblast or autonomous republic as now 
becoming a competent member of the federal system. But why? In 
those same United States there are 15 banking districts, when 
there are 50 states. In general, it is not compulsory, or even 
necessary, for the administrative boundaries of territorial 
formations to coincide with the boundaries of the banking 
districts. It is much more logical for these latter to coincide 
with the boundaries of the economic regions of a country, such 
as the Center of Russia, the Northwest, the Central Chernozem 
area, the Urals, West Siberia, etc. 
  No reforms in Russia will be successful if we reject, from 
the very start, the experience of other countries that have 
undergone huge critical shocks and have found a way out of them. 
At the beginning of the 1930's a monstrous economic crisis shook 
the United States. Industrial production dropped by 48 percent, 
one-third of the farmers and 5,000 commercial banks were ruined, 
and the nation's unemployed numbered about 14 million. F. 
Roosevelt, who had become president of the country, put a series 
of anticrisis laws through congress in the early days of his 
presidency. The first of them was the "Emergency Law on Banks." 
The houses of congress passed it in one day and the president 
signed it, that is, it went into force, in the evening. The 
status of commercial and investment banks was separated, which 
could not prevent mass speculation by the commercial banks in 
"short money" (which is widespread in Russia right now), but 
stimulated capital investments, which can only be the basis for 
an upsurge in the national economy. Unless there is an increase 
in capital investments in spheres such as agriculture, power 
engineering, machine-building, and light, food, and 
pharmaceutical industry, no monetary, customs, price, or state 
budgetary measures will provide a positive return for the 
national economy. 
  The experience of developing European and other countries 
after the second world war is extremely helpful to us right now. 
The regeneration of the economy, after the military collapse, on 
normal market bases, following the rigid state control of 
enterprises is very instructive. Once again, the main factor was 
the organization of investments, not the conversion of a unitary 
central bank into a federal reserve system or vice-versa. For 
example, Japan got out of the postwar economic crisis along two 
main channels. In the first place, the enterprises existing 
mainly through the treasury, in the course of approximately 10 
years after 1945 converted to commercial bases, to 
self-financing, and moreover they were divided up, merged, 
modernized, respecialized, etc., preparing for market conditions 
of operation. In the second place, the law established that 
commercial banks were obligated to transfer a quota of their 
liabilities "to the custody" of a central investment bank. This 
created a source of investment for regeneration and structural 
and technological reorganization of the country's economy. The 
results of these measures were manifested in the postwar 
augmented growth and improvement in the country's national 
economy in 1970-1990. 
  One more point--the interrelations between the central bank 
and the commercial banks. While up to the middle of our century, 
the Ministry of Finance and the treasury were the main monetary 
center for the state everywhere, since gold or primarily gold 
working capital were emitted, now the central banks come forth 
as this center. The country's central banks have essentially 
become the dictator of its monetary economy and relations with 
other countries. In our country the laws in force on the Central 
Bank and on commercial banks grant the latter more rights than 
is accepted in other industrial countries. This is one of the 
reasons why the economy has been brought to an increasingly 
chaotic state. For example, the Central Bank cannot or does not 
have the right to demand from a commercial bank everything 
necessary to analyze the statistics on its activity. Obviously, 
a unified law on the country's banking system is needed, in 
which the rights and duties of both the upper and lower levels 
of this system would be unequivocally stipulated. In addition, 
in a period of crisis, a third level of the banking system 
should be assigned--investment banks, as was done in crisis 
conditions in the United States, Japan, France, and other 
countries. On the whole, during the period of crisis, Russia 
needs emergency anticrisis laws, including those in the banking 
sphere. As we emerge from the crisis, measures can be taken to 
convert the present central banking system into a federal 
reserve system. But not before that. Preliminary developments, 
of course, must begin right now.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gennadiy Matveyevich Fadeyev, RF minister of </F>
railways, by correspondent Arkadiy Zhemchugov; date and place 
not given: "Gennadiy Fadeyev: `We Are in Favor of Mutually 
Beneficial Cooperation with Businessmen'"] 
  [Text] 
  [Zhemchugov] Gennadiy Matveyevich! Railway transport is 
known 
to be one of the few areas in which most, if not all, operations 
are regulated by the state. Nevertheless, First Deputy Chairman 
Oleg Soskovets of the RF Council of Ministers kept asking the 
railroad administrators who attended a domestic electronics 
exhibit in the Leningrad Station on 12 April about their 
relationship to commercial banks and business structures. Can 
you tell our readers anything about this? 
  [Fadeyev] The Ministry of Railways is in favor of mutually 
beneficial cooperation with commercial banks and business 
structures. What is more, it is assisting in the establishment 
of commercial structures, particularly those that might do 
something to achieve the current objectives of railway transport. 
  The Railroad Bank, a commercial institution, was established 
and is operating within the branch, and it already managed to 
achieve some impressive financial results last year. The capital 
stock of the bank is now being increased to 1.5 billion rubles, 
and the figure will rise to 5 billion in the future. According 
to plans, the Railroad Bank should aid in the establishment of a 
single banking system for the Russian railroads to speed up the 
transfer and circulation of financial resources. Virtually all 
of the railroads have operating commercial banks, and bank 
branches are being opened in railroad subdivisions and 
enterprises. The banking system is operating as an autonomous 
commercial structure, not only to attract investments and extend 
credit to rail transport enterprises, but also to earn money on 
its own. This is particularly important in view of the reduction 
of freight transport revenue. 
  The Ministry of Railways and the railroads have established 
commercial structures such as Sovfinamtrans, Apparel, and the 
Railway Joint-Stock Insurance Company, which will have a broad 
field of operations in connection with the institution of 
compulsory insurance for freight and passenger transport. An 
industrial finance company was recently founded to solve the 
problem of nonpayments. There are plans to establish a structure 
to handle supplementary pension security. According to railroad 
administrators, the commercial structures can develop most 
productively if they solve the specific problems of the branch 
and secure and improve transport services. 
  [Zhemchugov] Do you want to enlist the services of Russian 
businessmen in the resolution of current problems in rail 
transport? If so, what kind of plans have you made? 
  [Fadeyev] We certainly do want to do this. In particular, we 
want a domestic production base for the construction of rolling 
stock. You could say that this process has already begun. The 
production of electric trains, for example, has been organized 
at a plant in Torzhok, and without the use of government funds. 
  Participation by Russian businessmen in the improvement of 
transport services could be another important field of 
cooperation. Railroad administrators are willing to take the 
priority of certain freight shipments into account when they 
serve business structures. 
  Besides this, there are already some firms specializing in 
the safe arrival of freight, in freight expediting services, and 
in the monitoring of delivery schedules. Interaction with 
commercial structures is also possible in this field. 
  [Zhemchugov] How realistic are the plans for the 
construction 
and operation of private railroads in Russia? 
  [Fadeyev] The construction of private railroads in Russia 
would be extremely problematic: It would entail large capital 
investments and a long recoupment period. Private capital still 
cannot afford to take on projects of this kind without 
government support. The Gelleflint Joint-Stock Company, which 
plans to build the Lendmozero-Kochkoma line, and the High-Speed 
Highways Joint-Stock Company, which has already begun 
construction work, are experiencing a need for considerable 
government support. No one could object to the installation of 
private railway lines for the development of new mineral 
deposits, for instance, but any new railroad will have to 
operate at a loss for the first five years or so, and carrying 
losses for this length of time will probably be too inconvenient 
and unaffordable for business structures. 
  [Zhemchugov] Tell us what we all want to know: Will there be 
any fare increases before the end of this year? 
  [Fadeyev] Rail transport is one of the few branches in which 
the cost of its products and services is regulated by the state. 
Meanwhile, the prices of most of the products used by the 
railroads are not controlled. Regrettably, adjusting fares to 
keep up with rising costs cannot be avoided unless the state 
subsidizes the expenses of the branch, and this depends on 
budget prospects. 
  In view of the much more intense rail traffic in summer, the 
government wants to reduce the fares on suburban trains by 70 
percent from 30 April to 10 May 1994 and by 50 percent on 
holidays and weekends from 14 May to 25 September 1994 and 
compensate the Ministry of Railways for the resulting losses.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Nikolayevich Shokhin, Russian </F>
minister of economics, by Yelena Vishnevskaya; place and date 
not given: "At the Bottom of the Crisis Pit"] 
  [Text] Many people took heed of a recent statement by 
our prime minister to the effect that we are now at the lowest 
point of the crisis. They began to comment on it. In reality, 
the lowest point means there is nowhere deeper (read -- worse!) 
to go, means that next we should begin to rise. The path is slow 
and torturous, but it is upward. When will it start? How will it 
proceed? By what signs can we determine that it has, all the 
same, begun? How can we scramble out, albeit with bleeding 
fingers, but without falling back into the abyss? We must get 
through this low point as quickly as possible, feels Aleksandr 
Nikolayevich Shokhin, Russian minister of economics, or else the 
danger of falling to the bottom of the pit lies in wait for 
us. 
  [Shokhin] Even if everyone scrambles for himself, the way 
upward will become reality only when society comes to realize 
that we are now completely tied up. There is nobody to throw 
down a rope from the precipice -- preferential loans -- and to 
pull up an enterprise that has gone under -- the state has no 
money. Many captains of industry, however, still believe 
religiously in a bottomless state pocket. If nothing comes out 
of it, they explain that as the ill will of the government. 
Recently, when picketing miners were standing around the White 
House, I myself held in my hands the travel authorizations 
issued to the miners. On them -- in black and gray: 
such-and-such mine face worker is dispatched to Moscow to solve 
the problem of financing the coal industry. What social harmony 
we have here -- typical power methods! 
  [Vishnevskaya] All the newspapers have avoided the ZiL story 
-- also the pressure on the president and the government. How 
does the government intend to behave in situations like this? 
After all, these giants constitute thousands of workers, and 
this means a potential social explosion. 
  [Shokhin] What is happening there could not better reflect 
what is happening in our industry and the desire of the 
directorial corps to solve their problems by proven methods. 
After all, two-thirds of the plant's shares belong to the 
Mikrodin Company and the Moscow Federal Property Fund. So that 
they won't picket it? No, the ZiL workers appeal neither to 
commercial structures nor to the Moscow government. All because 
both of them, for loans and the more so for financing, need an 
effective production program and a guarantee of sales. Their 
plant management cannot provide them. So we are looking for a 
way to keep ZiL afloat. 
  [Vishnevskaya] Preferential loans without a guarantee of 
selling what has been produced? 
  [Shokhin] No. Consultation with shareholders, working out a 
program and a new management system. The Moscow authorities 
decided to ease the load on ZiL somewhat, after taking on its 
social infrastructure -- housing, medical institutions. I am now 
trying to talk the capital's government into turning over to the 
plant the land on which ZiL stands. With it as security, loans 
could be attracted. 
  [Vishnevskaya] Mortgage rights, a mortgage -- some time ago 
we began an active discussion of them, but things went no 
further than talks. After all, commercial banks could also grant 
a loan secured by land. 
  [Shokhin] This is one of the most important noninflationary 
methods of stabilization in key sectors. In this case, state 
guarantees might be given even to commercial structures 
investing funds in the development of production. I feel in 
general that the funds of Russian banks, commercial structures, 
finance companies, and institutional investors (pension, 
insurance funds) are a very important source of investment in 
the Russian economy. It is possible that we may have to 
guarantee the securities that they issue. But only when their 
funds go toward projects specified in the program for structural 
reorganization, agriculture, the defense complex. 
  [Vishnevskaya] Quite recently, when inflation was 20 percent 
and more a month, it would have been laughable at the least to 
talk about investments. Just who is going to invest money for 
several years under such conditions? Right now inflation rates 
have slowed noticeably. But they are linked to an unprecedented 
production slump. Have we not got into a vicious circle: In 
order for production to revive, we need money, and money means a 
rise in inflation, inflation fattens up additional capital and 
makes it unprofitable to invest in production? 
  [Shokhin] Some enterprises have already got into one, having 
picked up commercial loans at a high interest rate, not even 
thinking about how they will pay back the money. Even though, of 
course, this rate is clearly too high, and speculative. Low 
inflation has another advantage, however, which is somehow often 
forgotten --the possibility of reducing the interest rate. 
According to the information of the last three months, it could 
have been reduced to 160 percent without hurting 
credit-financial institutions. There are limits, of course, for 
example, the market interest rate. Here the state, having worked 
out a mechanism which makes it impossible to raise these 
interest rates, might have its say. 
  [Vishnevskaya] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, there are also loans 
from international financial institutions -- the International 
Monetary Fund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, the World Bank. Can we count on them? After all, 
what we can owe is limited by our potential for paying off the 
debt. What if we fall into a pit of debt. 
  [Shokhin] You are quite right. Right now we have submitted 
to 
the State Duma the draft of a law which limits aid to us to $5.7 
billion. In no way can we go over this sum! Otherwise, in the 
next few years "payment peaks" will arise and we will have to 
pay back up to half of the new loans to clear off the old ones. 
This is just about what happened in the last two years, when we 
were getting interstate loans without giving much thought to how 
to pay them back. 
  [Vishnevskaya] There are loans and loans, though. "Cheap" 
loan money can be invested in more profitable projects. Surely? 
  [Shokhin] Not quite. In the first place, because you have to 
pay more for a large loan. Even so, for 1994-1995 we invested 
$4.5 billion in the budget (but for 1992-1993 -- only $2.5 
billion). There are no more realistic possibilities, except 
through cutting back expenditures on items other than social 
ones. And in the second place, precisely because they are cheap, 
it is not worthwhile, for example, investing them in the 
development of the oil and gas complex. Commercial, more 
"expensive" loans can be drawn in there. So through the cheap 
ones, create a mechanism of social support for the population, 
and adapt the reforms, if you like, to the social-political 
situation in the country. 
  [Vishnevskaya] What do you mean? 
  [Shokhin] For example, practically everyone agrees that 
taxes 
have become too heavy for enterprises to bear. It would be nice 
to lower taxes instantly by 10-15 percent. Then, however, a tax 
gap is inevitable in the time between their reduction, and this 
means a reduction in budget receipts, and the increase in 
business activity, for which, strictly speaking, tax reform is 
needed. There is no way to fill this gap other than with the aid 
of foreign loans. Having obtained them in the autumn, and this 
is presumably $4 billion, they could go toward tax reform. 
Another direction for the use of "cheap" loans might be the 
development of a social infrastructure, with its transfer to the 
balance sheet of the enterprises (most of them have not had the 
money for it for a long time) and to municipal authorities. We 
could take out a social loan for this. Negotiations are in 
progress concerning a half-billion dollar loan of this sort. As 
for investment loans, here we must suppress our appetites a 
little and pass from loans secured by government guarantees to 
investments in specific projects, using a mortgage. 
  [Vishnevskaya] This is, though, a basically different form 
of 
borrowing money -- not from the government or international 
financial organizations, but from private investors. 
  [Shokhin] Yes. It is a turning point in interrelations 
between Russian and foreign entrepreneurs and banks. Private 
investments are direct investments according to project 
financing schemes. They will be given for a guarantee, not from 
the government, but from the creditor himself, for example, with 
land as security -- as we were talking about in the case of ZiL. 
  [Vishnevskaya] This mechanism presupposes not only the 
direct 
collaboration of two partners -- Russian and foreign -- but also 
the responsibility of the former to the latter? 
  [Shokhin] Yes, if the debt is not repaid, the creditor can 
sell the security (that same land), convert the rubles made to 
currency and export it abroad. Neither pickets nor leaflets nor 
meetings will help here. 
  [Vishnevskaya] But in order for a private investor to invest 
his money in the Russian economy, he should still have some sort 
of guarantee. If the Russian government does not pay back the 
sums invested in a bankrupt enterprise, at least have stable 
legislation -- customs, tax. In our country it runs up against, 
to put it mildly, the inconsistency of the decisions made. For 
example, why, suddenly, since December of last year, have they 
begun to levy tax on the added value of capital imported into 
Russia? After all, in September, an edict of the president 
introduced a moratorium for several years (!) on the force of 
the normative acts that worsen the conditions for the activity 
of foreign firms on Russian territory. 
  [Shokhin] This is an example of our legislative instability 
that worries actual and potential investors so much, an example 
of what free interpretation can be like. Explanations must be 
given here. The capital that was imported as part of the charter 
capital is not taxed. As for the investments, the tax on them 
immediately disappears, as soon as the equipment is installed, 
that is, the investments become real. The technical question, it 
is true, remains: whether to grant a deferment of the VAT 
payment for the period until the equipment is installed or to 
exact it right away, and then return the sum paid. There are 
difficulties involved in both the first and the second case. In 
the first -- how is the period for which the deferment is 
granted determined, and in the second -- should the sum paid be 
indexed on the basis of inflation. In any event, though, if a 
new tax or duty is introduced, a certain "period of adaptation" 
to the new regime is necessary. 
  [Vishnevskaya] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, it is not only 
foreign 
investors who need legislative and other stability in our 
country, though, our entrepreneurs need it too. I meet many 
plant and factory directors. Often they do not ask for 
privileges, but they want clear-cut, clearly understandable 
economic legislation, and also -- the removal of the 
restrictions that fetter their work. 
  [Shokhin] There is no doubt about it, everyone needs 
stability. Above all, one must adhere precisely to the laws, for 
example on the customs tariff, which does not specify any 
individual privileges. Even though, probably, we will not 
succeed in refusing all privileges, for example, for projects 
that are already being completed and established as privileged, 
you do not stop construction because of the last nut. But you do 
not have to pass these privileges through the budget and show 
how much we lose on them and monitor their object-oriented use 
as well. We must also remove thoughtless restrictions, for 
example, the quota, for that same petroleum complex, on the 
export of petroleum products. If nonpayments make it impossible 
for an oil refinery to trade with fellow countrymen, then do not 
stop production (and so on, meanwhile, along the chain, right 
down to the oil extractors, who are faced with the problem of 
whether to kill the wells!). Let them increase the export. 
  [Vishnevskaya] One hears all the time that there is not 
enough money. We think about how to attract foreign loans and 
investments and how to interest our entrepreneurs and financiers 
in investing funds in the development of the economy. Again, 
however, the draft of the state budget has been made up with a 
deficit, and moreover: The State Duma is proposing that this 
deficit be increased. After all, our country has its debtors. Or 
have these debts already been relegated to the ranks of the 
hopeless? 
  [Shokhin] There are, of course, hopeless ones. One must 
remember that our debtors are the least developed countries. The 
governments of some of them, on this basis, appealing to the 
feelings of the Russian leaders, are asking that their debts be 
remitted. To excuse the debts does not, however, mean forgetting 
about them. In this case each debtor requires his own approach. 
Libya, for example, is well enough off to pay us, for example, 
for the supply of oil. For this, however, the UN sanctions 
should be removed. Work is proceeding in this direction. In 
another direction, though -- it is not proceeding. I mean that 
many countries are already concluding pre-contractual protocols 
of intent with Libya. There is a danger that, when the sanctions 
are rescinded, we will not find ourselves first in this queue. 
  [Vishnevskaya] It is difficult even to get what is ours. 
What 
other methods can be used to recover our debts? 
  [Shokhin] This can be done, for example, through supply of 
traditional export goods. 
  [Vishnevskaya] Like China, which offers its feather-beds and 
track shoes in payment for the newest, most modern technological 
equipment? 
  [Shokhin] This is not, of course, the most profitable 
variant 
for us. There are others, though. For example, converting debts 
into property on the territory of the debtor-state. 
  [Vishnevskaya] But can we negotiate a debt to some other 
state whose economic level permits it to expect repayment? 
  [Shokhin] Yes. The only question is, in the first place, how 
much it will pay us, buying this debt, and in the second place, 
must we ourselves in this way leave our debtor's country. 
Perhaps we could work out a long-term scheme for repaying the 
debt, but remain in the country. The important thing today is 
not getting the money, even though we need it very much, but 
being included in economic and political dialogue as a member 
with equal rights.
