<F P=106> [Article by A. Yugrina: "Give...Stop...We Demand..."] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday morning at 0815 representatives of 
industrial enterprises of Novosibirsk organized a picket line at 
the entrance to the oblast administration building. The 
participants carried placards: "Halting production to curb 
inflation is insanity!" "Taxes are an octopus on the body of 
production." "The country was proud of the working class and now 
they are firing them." "We demand work!" "Without wages how will 
we feed our children?" "Stop the decline of production!" Judging 
from their content it is possible to determine the demands of 
the forthcoming protest rally, which will take place on 9 July. 
So far they are economic ones. That is what trade union leaders 
of the defense industry have decided. A natural question: "On 
the eve of a large action why was it necessary to 'besiege' the 
front entrance to the oblast administration?" 
  "It is a warning action. We want not only to draw attention 
to the needs of the working class but also to awaken the 
awareness of those who are still in an inert condition," says V. 
Tyulenkov, chairman of the trade union committee of the Kometa 
production association. 
  Unfortunately, for certain people the 50 percent decline of 
the production volume in "defense" and the radioelectronics 
industry is no cause for alarm. It is not without reason that 
they say that some people will not do anything until disaster is 
at their door. And perhaps the working man did not notice the 
first signs of it. Hidden unemployment has created the illusion 
of temporary difficulties with entering the market economy, and 
the pacifying speeches of government bureaucrats about the grace 
period for privatization hypnotized the people for a certain 
amount of time. But now the voice of the workers is beginning to 
cut through, and they are saying: "It is silent in the shop--it 
is an ominous silence!" 
  "Why did you decide to join the picket line today," I asked 
Olga Grigoryevna Baturina, an engineer of the scientific 
research institute of automatic instruments. 
  "I last received my wages in February. For six months now I 
have not received a stipend for my child," the young woman said 
almost in a whisper. I could see that she was very agitated 
because this was the first time she had participated in such a 
measure. Friends and acquaintances usually say of such people: 
"Quiet, modest, retiring, cannot stand up for herself." But Olga 
Grigoryevna's last hope lies with the local authorities. And 
today she has come out to defend herself and her child. 
  "They will definitely help us. After all, I have an 
eight-year-old child. What am I supposed to feed him?"--the 
woman asks. 
  "There is no money, but they order us to survive!"--this was 
the theme of the reproachful placards of the engineers of 
another scientific research institute. A group of women here are 
in the mood for a more purposeful discussion. 
  "Our Zoya Nikolayevna Sadkova died recently. She had a month 
to go before she received her pension. The diagnosis on the 
death certificate was exhaustion from hunger"--this is what the 
person carrying the placard told me. These women no longer 
believe in either the local or the higher authorities. 
  I met the chief of the oblast administration, I.I. Indinok, 
with the picketers. 
  "Ivan Ivanovich, how do you intend to solve the social 
problems in the oblast?" a television correspondent asked the 
governor. 
  "Perhaps we can solve this problem together?" I. Indinok 
answered a question with another question and pointed to a 
placard--"Oblast administration! Protect the children from the 
decadence of TV and radio!" 
  The questions, demands, and requests were left for the 
rally. 
What will it do? Will the circle of mutual nonpayments be 
broken, will the tax rates change, will the jobs be returned, 
will earned money be paid?...

<F P=106> [Article by Galina Vasilyeva: "How Much Charity Costs; the </F>
Social Assistance Service Was Financed in the Best of Times 
According to the Residual Principle"] 
  [Text] What is it really that speaks of this day? 
  The state publishes edicts and decrees, looking for 
resources 
as much as possible. And social protection seems to correct the 
rules of the game that are imposed on us by the market. 
  In Novosibirsk, social protection departments have been 
established in all rayons of the city. In the first quarter, 
R110 million have been allocated from the city budget for 
providing material assistance (already more than R250 million in 
the second quarter). 
  Seven people work in this department in Tsentralnyy Rayon. 
Employees of the department looked after 465 families at the 
beginning of the year. Material assistance was received by 1,392 
people. Among them were pensioners and invalids, large families 
and single mothers, and people who were victims of the Chernobyl 
catastrophe. 
  The provision of daily bread always remains the overriding 
task. The distribution of acquired resources cannot be resolved 
with a simple measure. Therefore, officials of the social 
protection administration turn directly to the producers of food 
products and conclude contracts for deliveries. Simultaneously, 
contracts are concluded with stores, and money is transferred 
there for the purchase of commodities (interest-free loan) so 
that the poorly provided for residents of the rayon would make 
purchases of food products in the Energy and Echo municipal 
enterprises at prices that are 15 percent lower than retail 
prices. But in the Hermes and Dawn stores, 490 people received 
food products free of charge. For these purposes, R2.5 million 
were allocated. According to a contract on cooperation with the 
Clothing trade-production firm, people acquired goods at a 20 
percent discount (40 critically needy families received knitted 
underwear here free of charge): The Shveybyt joint-stock company 
helped mend and make clothing as good as new for half price. The 
rayon administration allocated credit of R10 million for these 
purposes. 
  All told in the first quarter, more than R9 million was 
expended on material assistance, R2.7 million was received from 
the city budget, and the rest of the resources drawn in by the 
rayon administration were received from sponsors. 
  Daily bread is a problem that is common to everyone--daily, 
constant, but far from the only one. All of the data on the 
people, and on their needs, are entered into a computer. 
Everything about life, and what it is like: Swimming lessons 
were covered for 36 children; 13 families had refrigerators 
repaired; 140 families received seeds and books on vegetable 
gardening; fares for the transport of invalids, for students of 
large families, and for families where there are two and more 
invalids, were paid for. 
  As usual, everyday life is brightened by celebrations and 
holidays. One hundred and forty participants in the Battle of 
Leningrad and blockade-runners came to a meeting where there was 
a concert, the presentation of commemorative souvenirs, and a 
festive dinner. In celebration of 8 March, gifts totalling R3 
million were presented to women from large families and 
incomplete families, invalids, and single pensioners. The 
holiday Spring was organized at the end of March for pensioners 
and invalids. Using the occasion, workers of the housing 
administration of the rayon and the Central Savings Bank 
clarified the situation on allowances for the payment of 
housing. Fifty-seven pensioners and invalids rested in holiday 
hotels and sanatoriums. Two single elderly people formed school 
boarding houses. It turned out that making living arrangements 
for elderly single people is the most difficult problem to 
resolve today. 
  Two hundred and nine of them, who have ended up facing life 
alone, are provided services at home. Three social assistance 
sections, in which women work, were established for this in the 
rayon. Each of the women has up to 10 wards. 
  What is behind this? Most of all, helplessness and old age. 
Sometimes the physical load is easier to bear than communication 
with people who are out of favor with fate. Of course, not 
everyone survives. Many work out of hopelessness--they were laid 
off from service. 
  Elderly people spoke with gratitude about the work of Marina 
Aleksandrovna Sheina, Svetlana Stepanovna Manuylova, and Olga 
Veniaminovna Rozovska. Others were also mentioned, but these 
women requested that they not be named: The children are 
embarrassed by the work of their mothers. Some day they will 
understand that the most onerous but also the most noble burden 
fell to the lot of their mothers--to take into their hands the 
concerns of their fellow citizens. We often hear the phrase: 
"The level of a civilized state is determined by the attitude in 
it toward old people and children." But the state--this, after 
all, is us?

<F P=106> [Interview with psychiatrist-narcologist L.V. Pushkareva by </F>
Inessa Lasovskaya in Novosibirsk, under the rubric "Stay 
Healthy!"; date not given: "Alas, Drug Addicts Learn Only From 
Their Own Experience"] 
  [Text] The number of children and teenagers 
registered by drug rehabilitation clinics because of a weakness 
for alcohol, drugs, and toxic substances has increased by a 
factor of more than two in our city. 
  The narcologists and the mayoralty committee for youth 
affairs believe inviting both children and parents to a meeting 
at the imeni October Revolution House of Culture at 1500 on 8 
June to be one of the measures to hamper the spread of this 
teenage "epidemic." They planned to show a very interesting film 
which clarifies many points, and to comment on what the film 
narrates and what happens to those who are brought up on the 
street. Physician-narcologists will present answers that are 
easy for children to understand to all the complex questions 
that are asked from the floor. 
  As we announce this event and deeply appreciate the anxiety 
of the public, we offer for your attention an interview with 
psychiatrist-narcologist Larisa Vladimirovna Pushkareva, chief 
of the adolescent ward of the municipal city drug rehabilitation 
clinic. 
  [Lasovskaya] Larisa Vladimirovna, how does it still happen 
that adults living side by side with a teenager do not notice 
that they have a real drug addict in the family? 
  [Pushkareva] This happens when attention is paid to the 
children only in a pro forma manner: They are fed and clothed. 
Upbringing means work and responsibility. One cannot shift this 
direct duty to others. Depraved inclinations develop out of a 
lack of occupation; many cling to "their own" groups and packs 
just because they have nothing to do. They go to "their own" 
kind because of a lack of understanding from adults. Their 
parents are seldom their friends and advisers; more frequently 
they act as prosecutors. Meanwhile, adolescents have their own 
problems. A girl fell in love, and the boy dumped her. This is a 
tragedy for her. A girlfriend makes her an offer: "Here, take 
this, you will feel better." Perhaps this girl, having gotten 
used to the regular use of the "tranquilizer," will pity some 
other person. You and I may not know how drugs are distributed, 
but they know! 
  [Lasovskaya] One gets the impression that modern-day 
children 
have no notion of the danger in which they are putting their 
lives. Among those whom you begin to treat, is there not a 
single person who has discussed this topic with adults? 
  [Pushkareva] Why not? About 30 percent have been forced to 
listen to admonitions from their mothers and fathers. However, 
like fools, they learn from their own experience, although these 
children are far from stupid, rather the other way around. 
  [Lasovskaya] It is clear as far as they are concerned, but 
what about the parents? Why do they fail to see deviations in 
the behavior of their children? Or are the signs of drug 
addiction imperceptible? 
  [Pushkareva] It is precisely the point that they leap out at 
you. The toxic substance addict altogether reeks of glue from 
three kilometers away. Both drug addicts and nascent alcoholics 
cannot conceal mounting aggression, nor do they want to conceal 
it. Love in children alternates with hate. How is this normal? 
And what about a puffy face? What about memory loss? What about 
strange burns and skin lesions? They deliberately slit their 
skin; for them, this is a technique for the infusion of 
intoxicating preparations. They have bruises along their veins, 
they behave as if they were drunk, but there is no smell. Is 
this easy to overlook? However, many parents display unsoundness 
even on learning of the disease. We are the ones trying to 
convince them: It is not coming to us that is shameful, but 
failing to have your child treated. Or else they bring their 
children and sort of dump them on us: "Do what you want. Treat 
them any way you know how, but we cannot do anything any more." 
  [Lasovskaya] In general, you are not discussing your work in 
the mass media in vain. By all signs, your work has picked up in 
response to the growth of adolescent drug addiction and the 
crime it entails. We have an opportunity to give a telephone 
number which people may call for your advice. 
  [Pushkareva] The telephone number is 23-48-14. Ask for me, 
Larisa Vladimirovna. At the reception office of the clinic they 
will immediately understand what will be discussed. Recently we 
separated from the city adolescent narcological complex which 
had an inpatient facility and a chain of outpatient facilities. 
  [Lasovskaya] Support from the public is needed for the 
efforts of adolescent narcologists to rescue perishing children. 
Do you encounter indifference most often nonetheless? 
  [Pushkareva] It is easier for me to answer by giving 
favorable examples. We have invited parents, teachers, 
guardians, adolescents, and members of commissions for minors' 
affairs for a meeting on 8 June at a large auditorium (holding 
500 people). So, Kalininskiy Rayon has even made arrangements 
for its own bus to bring in all those who wish to come, and this 
is characteristic of them! Central Rayon accommodates us in all 
our endeavors; it is easy to work with any representative of the 
rayon administration there. I hope that such examples will be 
much more numerous. 
<H5>  *** </H5>
  Like all adolescent narcologists of the city, Larisa 
Vladimirovna Pushkareva handles three times the regular 
workload, and not just because this is virtually a new specialty 
for physicians which has been occasioned by our new, utterly 
debauched times. When there was strict morality there were 
modest children and plain pediatricians. Then the immoral video 
conditioning for depraved inclinations appeared, and the pattern 
of assistance to children by physicians changed: Children are 
now treated by venereal disease specialists and narcologists. 
They are already taking up functions which are not properly 
theirs: Distracted from the treatment process, they go to youth 
audiences to meet potential patients and call things by their 
proper names, or try to talk some sense into parents: Please 
understand that the departure of a child from the family and 
preoccupation with "grass" are paths toward tragedy. Adolescent 
drug addiction (alcoholism, toxic substance addiction) is a new 
mass disease which is transmitted through the social milieu, 
through the communication of children. It should be perceived 
precisely as a disease--that is, your own and other children 
alike should be protected against it.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Gavrilina: "Soldiers, Gallant Fellows, </F>
Where Is Your Conscience?"] 
  [Text] "The Basics of Security and Vital Activity" is the 
subject now being taught in many schools. You will guess at 
once that under this name one can infer the formerly named 
"basic military preparation [NVP]." Employees of the city draft 
board responsible for educational work consider that it is 
necessary to resurrect this subject, since the absence of NVP is 
one of the reaons for the poor results of the callup. 
  The draft board polled the draftees. Twenty percent of those 
questioned would willingly enter the Army; 15.7 percent intended 
to avoid it in any way possible; 33 percent would enter service, 
but without enthusiasm. The rest perferred not to express 
themselves. 
  Among the motives expressed by the "draft dodgers," the 
youths' fear for their life if assigned to "hot spots" 
dominated. Other reasons named were domestic disorder and the 
low prestige of army service. 
  Therefore, jointly with the city authorities, it is planned 
to implement a large-scale program for preparing youth for 
service in the Armed Forces. Military-patriotic education 
occupies first place in this program. 
  However, in all probability draftees and their parents are 
more worried about such things as health, security and the 
possibility of completing their education. Letters read at a 
press conference held yesterday by acting city draft 
commissioner Vladimir Davydov attest to this. 
  Despite the fact that 11 draft dodgers were sentenced last 
year and 177 criminal suits are still ongoing, those subect to 
callup are not hurrying to the draft board. 
  From the point of view of the city draft board the Army is 
not at fault. New recruits are sent to "hot spots" only with 
their agreement. Draftees from the North-West region, 
particularly married ones, as a rule remain in that region. Mr. 
Pichikov, a representative of the military-medical commission, 
vowed that "the Army doesn't need sick men" and none of the 
youths with medical problems would be forced to serve.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Zubkov, chief of the Tax Inspectorate </F>
of St. Petersburg, by Valentina Shestakova; place and date not 
given: "Extremism Is Not the Best Remedy for a Sick Economy"] 
  [Text] Viktor Zubkov was appointed chief of the Tax 
Inspectorate of St. Petersburg with the rank of deputy minister 
seven months ago. He "inherited" a number of unresolved public 
proceedings against the property fund and joint ventures and 
arbitration proceedings involving numerous commercial structures 
that had filed lawsuits over what they viewed as illegitimate 
punitive sanctions by the tax inspectorate. The introduction of 
new federal taxes and the vigorous creation of norms by the 
local authorities were fraught with new conflicts involving the 
tax organs. However, it blew over. In the first quarter of the 
new year, the revenues of the budget increased by 4.5 percent as 
compared to the fourth quarter of last year. In April, the 
budget took in 382 million [as published], the assignment being 
340 million [as published]. In total, 1.080 trillion rubles [R] 
were taken in during the four months. Viktor Alekseyevich Zubkov 
discusses the reserves that were tapped in order to invigorate 
the intake of budgetary receipts: 
  [Zubkov] First, we made the rayon tax inspectorates 
completely independent: Their chiefs no longer rush to the head 
office over every trifle. 
  Second, we established an economic council at the 
inspectorate. Issues of perfecting tax legislation are discussed 
at the meetings of the council. They are later considered by the 
mayor of the city, the government, or the State Tax Service. The 
developed decisions concern the making of advance payments by 
small enterprises, specify procedures for tax relief on profits, 
control small-scale retail trade, and cancel unjustifiably harsh 
measures against the violators of tax legislation. 
  For example, the edict of the president "On Offering a Tax 
Amnesty in 1993" envisions that enterprises and entrepreneurs 
who declared the underpayment of taxes before 30 November 1993 
and paid the taxes before the same deadline shall not be subject 
to relevant sanctions. If the tax organs discover concealed 
receipts after the indicated deadlines, fines shall be collected 
at three times the rate. 
  Those who have understated receipts frequently do not even 
suspect that they have done so. The use of the tripled rates of 
fines in the case of such taxpayers can hardly be considered 
correct. We propose to index the underpayment as of the moment 
of concealment or understatement of payments to the budget. 
  The computerization of our inspectorate is among the 
measures 
taken which we always mention with pleasure. 
  In early May, we signed a memorandum on the creation of a 
computer network at the Tax Inspectorate of St. Petersburg with 
the Government of Denmark. This is a large project, which is 
worth more than $3.5 million and is financed by the Government 
of Denmark. In addition to being outfitted with hardware and 
communications, it is intended to allocate large funds for the 
training of rayon inspectors and the improvement of computer 
programming. 
  [Shestakova] So, you succeeded in doing something more than 
just reinforcing the fiscal authorities. The outflow of 
professional financiers from the inspectorate ceased; the audits 
of banks and commercial structures no longer look like guerrilla 
raids. The Finnish and Swedish governmental press, which 
clamored to the whole world over the undiplomatic approach of 
the Russian authorities to the economic operations of joint 
ventures, has finally fallen silent.... 
  [Zubkov] I see what you are talking about. All the problems 
with joint ventures, the property fund, and other taxpayers 
which developed last year could have been solved quietly, 
without resorting to aggressive publicity. Indeed, a large 
amount of fines, $24 million, was assessed against the Grand 
Hotel Europe. There were also smaller amounts--the 
Lenraumamebel, Pizza-Express. 
  The rayon financial services uncover financial violations. 
Subsequently, the penalized enterprises approach the Russian Tax 
Service and the government, and the latter examine the case with 
our participation. The financial standing of these organizations 
is analyzed, and a way is sought to punish the transgressors 
without bankrupting them. 
  If the Lenraumamebel does close, how will it make things 
better for anybody? The enterprise will wind down production, 
and the 600 Russians it employs will be thrown out into the 
street. I think that in such cases a compromise should be found. 
  This is not to say that such enterprises should be exempted 
from fines or penalties. However, the fines should not finish 
them off. 
  As far as the property fund is concerned, 92 million rubles 
have been assessed against it rather than sums going into the 
billions, as was advertised. They have already remitted R9.3 
million to the budget. And R69 million have been remitted from 
the accounts of the fund without recourse. We will definitely 
collect the balance. A special commission will monitor this. 
  [Shestakova] The budget is demanding still new infusions, 
including yet another round of harsher taxation. Thus, by his 
Edict No. 2270, the president granted the local authorities the 
right to independently set the rates of taxes and introduce new 
taxes. St. Petersburg was quick to take advantage of this right 
and, next to Moscow, is a leader in tightening the taxes.... 
  [Zubkov] We got three new taxes confirmed by a directive of 
the mayor: for the maintenance of the housing stock, facilities 
of the sociocultural sector, and law enforcement organs. The 
land fee increased 10-fold. Another three taxes are pending. As 
a large European city, St. Petersburg should introduce taxes on 
car parking, the passage of vessels along the Neva, and for 
entering the city. This should be done as soon as possible. A 
great many foreign-made cars are parked in the downtown area of 
the city for weeks, and private parking lots are getting 
organized. Their owners hardly pay anything to the budget. 
  However, the city has been given the right not just to 
introduce taxes, but also to grant exemptions from them. 
  If a certain company has been worn down by fees but its 
operation is a vital necessity for the city, we are entitled to 
seek an exemption from some local taxes for the enterprise 
through the economic council. The federal taxes are not our 
prerogative. 
  The reserve sources of budgetary receipts have not been 
depleted yet. A special directorate that only handles large 
payers was created at the inspectorate. Most of them have not 
been audited once in the last three years. Large enterprises 
will now be monitored on an annual basis. 
  Relief and reductions granted to the Lenenergo, the 
Vodokanal, and other enterprises of municipal services run up to 
about R30 billion; however, these infusions have not produced 
results for the city. It is much more feasible to make them 
count money and value every job. This year, we have already 
directed the tax personnel to step up work with individuals, 
including foreign citizens. All of this means extra money. 
Budgetary proceeds also increase in a stable manner due to the 
invigoration of the work of the state inspectorate, jointly with 
the Tax Police Department, on commercial structures, the trade 
sector, and large payers.

<F P=106> [Article by Veniamin Bereslavskiy, under the "From a Fact to </F>
a Phenomenon" rubric: "Summer: Mercury Hunters"] 
  [Text] Thirty children from a multifamily building on 
Parashyutnaya Street in Primorskiy Rayon finished out the school 
year at the clinic of the Medical Institute of Pediatrics. They 
were recently discharged from the hospital after comprehensive 
evaluation and treatment. As the intern of the chair of 
childhood diseases, M. Soboleva, testifies, signs of the 
influence of mercury, which to one degree or another affected 
the health condition of the young patients and may be a factor 
in their future, were found in all the children. 
  The case with which I began occurred precisely when the Days 
of Protection Against Ecological Dangers was being held in St. 
Petersburg. The two-month event has the resounding motto, 
"Ecology--Safety--Life," which in itself testifies to the 
significance of raising ecological issues in the city. The lives 
of the people are indeed on the line! However, recently yet 
another warning sign--"Attention--mercury!"--appeared on 
Podkovyrov Street in Petrogradskiy Rayon, next to a house where 
a playground used to be. Almost one month has passed, but so far 
only the initial work on the cleanup of the area has been done. 
The further demercurization (this is precisely what a mercury 
cleanup is called) has been suspended, because it is not clear 
who must pay for the quite complex measures to clear away the 
pileups of construction refuse, metal, and all kinds of junk, as 
well as to dismantle a burned-out outbuilding. 
  Mercury does not forgive haste and negligence; it appears on 
the list of particularly poisonous, toxic substances. Inhaling 
mercury vapors is extremely harmful: The liver, the kidneys, and 
the nervous system are afflicted. Initially, the symptoms of 
poisoning are unclear and fuzzy--fatigue, irritability, 
headaches, dizziness. However, most serious diseases develop 
later under the protracted influence of the vapors. 
  After an extensive survey was taken several years ago, it 
was 
discovered that about one-half of the schools in the city, one 
day-care center in five, and one-fifth of the premises of 
health-care facilities, including maternity wards, were 
contaminated with mercury. Major measures to control the danger 
of mercury were taken; the citywide Demercurization program was 
developed for the first time in Russia and is being implemented. 
An obstacle was thrown up to the vicious "mercury breath." A 
tremendous and significant effort has been undertaken; as of 
now, contamination has been cleaned up in all schools and 
day-care facilities for children of the city. It is forbidden to 
use any instruments containing mercury in class; nor is mercury 
used in chemical experiments now. 
  The case is more complex with health-care facilities, 
numerous colleges and scientific research institutions, and 
enterprises where mercury-containing instruments are used. They 
usually get away by claiming that demercurization will allegedly 
interfere with the normal operation of enterprises and 
institutions. However, is it normal for newborns to be on 
occasion held in rooms where the maximum permissible 
concentration of mercury is exceeded? Is it normal for students 
to remain for a long time in laboratories contaminated with 
mercury? Is it normal for dozens of enterprises using mercury 
and instruments containing mercury not to be certified from the 
point of view of ecological danger? Is it normal that any one of 
us may be taken hostage by some plant in whose compound the 
unrecorded poisonous metal freely "circulates?" 
  For the first time, mercury cleanup specialists developed, 
jointly with the sanitation and disease control inspectorate, 
clear-cut rules for recording, storing, and using mercury and 
mercury-based instruments, set strict norms, and mapped out all 
possible obstacles in the path of the toxic substance. Alas, the 
documents on which protection for you and me could have been 
based have drawn no response from the mayoralty for many months 
now. 
  Fortunately, St. Petersburg is one of the few cities of 
Russia that has everything it takes to control mercury 
pollution. An ecological unit is in operation at the All-Russian 
Institute of Geophysical Surveys, VIRG (telephone 567-88-02) 
whose specialists can promptly survey premises, city 
territories, and sources of water supply. The State Enterprise 
for Ecological, Geological, and Geophysical Research, EGGI 
(telephone 312-62-09) has likewise mastered all up-to-date 
methods for mercury detection and cleanup at facilities. The 
municipal PITsER--the St. Petersburg Engineering Center for 
Ecological Projects--was established in 1991. It has assumed 
responsibility for both emergency efforts and planned actions to 
clean up contamination, and for the collection of mercury and 
mercury-containing instruments whose service life has ended or 
which have broken down while in operation. 
  Even during such a small accident, it is best to call in the 
PITsER at the telephone 218-80-69. 
  The mercury cleanup specialists of St. Petersburg earn their 
bread through hard labor. It is good that several subdivisions 
exist which are independent of one another--the PITsER, the 
EGGI, the VIRG-Rudgeofizika. It is bad that they, those who 
protect us against a real threat, are put in a situation of 
continuous rivalry, that each one of them uses solely his own 
methods without striving to use outside accomplishments. I think 
that it would be very proper for our environmental protection 
department to ensure effective interaction. It is hardly 
reasonable at present to sacrifice some elements and be left 
without knowledgeable and self-sacrificing people when the 
danger has not been completely eliminated.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Gavrilina: "Will the Duma Help Russian </F>
Science?"] 
  [Text] The St. Petersburg Union of Scientists, 
jointly with the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] St. 
Petersburg Scientific Center, invited Oksana Dmitriyeva, a 
deputy of the State Duma and chairman of the budget 
subcommittee, to a regular seminar from the cycle "Science and 
Power." The topic of the discussion was phrased as follows: "The 
Budget and Tax Policy With Regard to Science as a Result of 
Activities of Certain Influence Groups Within the 
Authorities." 
  The leader of the seminar, Sergey Kozyrev, vice president of 
the St. Petersburg Union of Scientists, said that the desire to 
learn "from the horse's mouth" what the authorities really 
intend to undertake in order that the situation of science, 
especially basic research, no longer be catastrophic was the 
objective of the meeting. 
  The budget that was approved in the first reading calls for 
allocating 3.5 trillion rubles [R] for science. This number with 
many zeros is much smaller than the amount designated for 
agrarians. What is to be done when funds are appropriated for 
basic research that are only twice as large as those for 
repairing the White House? 
  They asked Oksana Dmitriyeva this question: Does the Duma 
understand that the irreversible decay of science in our country 
is possible? The intellectual elite is migrating abroad, young 
scientists are changing professions.... 
  Dmitriyeva gave hope to the participants in the seminar by 
stating that the situation whereby the Ministry of Finance 
delayed the payment of money to scientific institutions would be 
rectified. She mentioned the development of policy proposals in 
this area jointly with the scholarly community as a direction 
for the operation of her subcommittee. Oksana Dmitriyeva said 
that it is necessary to seek a "transparent" budget for science, 
and the Duma can resolve this issue.

"There Was Once Such a Profession as Defending the Motherland"] 
  [Text] As of today, 1,750 young residents of St. 
Petersburg have refused to report to military commissariats. 
  Yesterday, Deputy Mayor Vladimir Putin held a conference at 
the Smolnyy on the issues of military draft. It was announced 
that the fall draft had not been completely finished until 
March. In the process, 16,000 people from St. Petersburg were 
drafted into the ranks of the Armed Forces. Participants in the 
conference noted that the number of draftees without a secondary 
education has increased sharply in the last three years. Some 35 
percent "admitted they have used drugs." Strange as it may be, 
only one-quarter of the total number of latter-day servicemen 
"consume alcohol." Many young men are seriously ill; as a 
result, one in three is found unfit for service. 
  Participants in the conference expressed their 
dissatisfaction with "legal nihilism mounting" among young 
people recently: As of today, 1,750 people have refused to 
report to military commissariats. In conjunction with this, the 
issue of coordinating the efforts of military commissariats, the 
militia, the procuracy, educational establishments, and rayon 
administrations was raised at the conference once again. These 
structures intend to work out soon a concept in keeping with 
which rules specifying the draft system in St. Petersburg will 
be approved. 
  Representatives of the Leningrad Military District gave hope 
to the draftees of St. Petersburg by informing them that there 
is no threat of service far away from home, noting in the 
process that "young people who already have their own families 
will definitely serve in the vicinity of St. Petersburg." It is 
planned that only servicemen who have served for no less than 
half a year will be sent to the "hot spots" of our country, and 
then only on a voluntary basis.

<F P=106> [Article by L. Rakhmanov: "Military Commissariats Appeal to </F>
Patriotism"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, a conference concerning the issues 
of the draft into military service was held at the mayoralty. 
The conference was attended by representatives of the military 
commissariats of the city, law enforcement organs, and heads of 
rayon administrations. 
  Despite the 1993 quota for the draft into the Army having 
been met, concern about the "unpatriotic sentiment" of the young 
people of St. Petersburg was voiced at the conference. This 
phenomenon has been registered among both the draftees and their 
parents, who sometimes try to spare their children military 
service by hook or by crook. 
  The number of persons without a secondary education has 
sharply increased among the draftees. Such persons account for 
40 percent at present. 
  Besides, the number of those unfit for military service 
continues to increase. During the fall draft, 8,300 such persons 
were registered; in 1993 as a whole, one in three was 
"rejected." Many of the diseases are of the kind caused by drug 
abuse. 
  The "evaders" are a special headache for the military 
commissariats. In 1993, there were several thousand of them; 
among them are both those who failed to report to military 
commissariats and those who have changed their place of 
residence. Search teams were organized, which succeeded in 
bringing 14,500 [as published] people to the premises of 
military commissariats. They did not succeed in locating 500 
"evaders." 
  The staff of the district has now given the assignment to 
draft 6,800 persons. Some of them have already reported to 
induction centers. However, participants in the conference noted 
that problems might recur during the spring draft in the absence 
of cooperation between the organs of government, the military, 
and the law enforcement organs. In particular, it is necessary 
to computerize the operation of passport desks so that the 
military commissariats will be able to promptly track changes in 
the registered residence of draftees, as well as to revisit the 
patriotic conditioning of young people. 
  It should be added that effective 25 May, the draft of 
military reservists for active-duty training was suspended in 
both St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast. This happened because 
the Ministry of Defense of Russia is currently unable to finance 
this training.

People's Deputies of 19 May 1994: On Progress in Implementing 
the 25 June 1990 Decision of the Third Session of the City 
Soviet 'Concerning Basic Measures for Improving the Ecological 
Situation in the City of Kazan'"] 
  [Text] Having examined information on the progress in 
implementing the 25 June 1990 decision of the third session of 
the city soviet "Concerning Basic Measures for Improving the 
Ecological Situation in the City of Kazan," the session of the 
city soviet notes that, in accordance with the decision adopted 
by the city soviet, the administration of the city carried out 
purposeful work in perfecting environmental protection activity, 
implementing a shift from administrative to economic methods of 
rational wildlife management, and increasing the responsibility 
of wildlife managers for compliance with environmental 
protection legislation. 
  A city ecological soviet was established for the purpose of 
coordinating environmental protection activity, and two 
environmental protection procuracies and a sanitary-ecological 
militia are working actively. A system of payments for 
discharges (disposal) of polluting substances into the 
surrounding natural environment has been introduced. A city 
off-budget ecology fund has been organized. Together with budget 
appropriations, resources of the ecological fund were expended 
on city environmental protection measures that were approved by 
the city ecological soviet and the permanent commission on 
questions of ecology and the protection of the health of the 
population; a radiological survey and a decontamination of 
polluted sectors were conducted; work was continued on improving 
the sanitary conditions of Lake Kaban and other reservoirs of 
the city; work is being done on the development of a 
comprehensive territorial environmental protection plan 
(TerKSOP) of the city of Kazan and the surrounding Kazan region, 
a plant TER [not further identified] has been developed on the 
utilization of everyday and industrial wastes, and work is being 
concluded on the construction of a unit to remove mercury from 
mercury lamps, etc. 
  A long-range program to increase the ecological reliability 
of waterline-sewer networks and structures and of engineering 
structures for the protection of the city has been developed and 
approved, and a program for the ecological improvement of the 
storm water drainage system is in the developmental stage. 
  All of this, together with the drop in the volume of 
production, made it possible in just the last year to reduce the 
discharges of harmful substances into the atmosphere by 12 
percent, and into open reservoirs--by 15 percent. 
  At the same time a number of tasks set by the decision of 
the 
third session remain unfulfilled. In particular, the 
construction of car wash facilities at the entrances to the city 
is being delayed, and questions are not being resolved on 
providing the city with nonethylated gas 
  The Kazan City Soviet DECIDED: 
  1. Information "On Progress in Implementing the 25 June 1990 
Decision of the Third Session of the Kazan City Soviet 
'Concerning Basic Measures for Improving the Ecological 
Situation in the City of Kazan'" will be taken into 
consideration (attached). 
  2. The head of administration of the city (Comrade K.Sh. 
Iskhakov) will: 
  2.1 In the period up to 15 June 1994, develop a program of 
top-priority environmental protection measures for the city of 
Kazan for 1994-1995. 
  2.2 Provide for the allocation in 1994 of the necessary 
resources for the continuation of work in the TerKSOP program of 
the city of Kazan and the surrounding Kazan region. 
  3. Remove from control the 25 June 1990 decision of the 
third 
session of the city soviet "Concerning Basic Measures for 
Improving the Ecological Situation in the City of Kazan." 
  4. Entrust control over the implementation of this decision 
to Comrade N. Rybushkin, deputy chairman of the city soviet, and 
the permanent commission on questions of ecology and protection 
of the health of the population. 
  [Signed] Chairman K.Zh. Iskhakov.

in Implementing the Decision of the Third Session of the Kazan 
City Soviet of People's Deputies `Concerning Basic Measures for 
Improving the Ecological Situation in the City of Kazan' of 25 
June 1990"] 
  [Text] The system of payments for the discharge (disposal) 
of contaminating substances into the natural environment in 1993 
involved 652 enterprises and organizations of the city (in 
1990--52, 1991--168, 1992--226.) 
  In 1990 the city ecological fund account received R760,000, 
in 1991--R12.6 million, in 1992--R28.7 million, and in 
1993--R93.3 million. 
  The resources were spent on city environmental protection 
measures in accordance with the plan approved at meetings of the 
city ecological soviet and the deputy commission for ecology and 
the protection of the health of the population. 
  In particular: On conducting radiological surveys and 
decontaminating polluted sectors, on sanitizing Lake Kaban and 
other reservoirs of the city, on developing TerKSOP [Territorial 
Comprehensive Environmental Protection Plan], on the 
technical-economic account of the plant for utilizing everyday 
and industrial wastes, on constructing a unit to remove the 
mercury from mercury lamps, and on other matters. 
  In 1993 computations were conducted for payments by 652 
large 
enterprises and organizations of the city (1990--52; 1991--168; 
1992--226). 
  Coordination of the activity in the sphere of environmental 
protection is ensured by the city ecological council. A 
scientific-technical expert council and a laboratory council 
were established under the city ecological council. 
  Monitoring compliance with environmental protection 
legislation by wildlife managers is carried out by the Central 
Territorial Administration of the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources of Tatarstan, the city and 
rayon centers of Gossanepidnadzor [State Sanitation and 
Epidemiologic Inspectorate], two environmental protection 
procuracies, and the sanitary-ecological militia of the 
Directorate of Internal Affairs of Kazan. 
  In 1991-1993, in connection with the violation of 
environmental protection legislation, the Central Territorial 
Administration of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources of the Republic of Tatarstan halted the 
operation of 15 installations, including the installation for 
burning industrial wastes at the Tasma PO [Production 
Association], the testing ground for the burning of industrial 
wastes of the NPO [Scientific Production Association] imeni V.I. 
Lenin, the cement mixing center of the Kazan PSK [not further 
identified], the foundry sector of the Melita joint-stock 
company, the KVPO [not further identified] sector of marshalite, 
and others. 
  The city center of the State Sanitary-Epidemiologic 
Inspectorate issued seven decrees on the cessation of operations 
of establishments (the galvanic coating shop of the 
Neftepromavtomatika NPO, Shop No. 4 of the Vakuummash PO, Shop 
No. 1 of Tatmebel, the container site of PRSO [not further 
identified], sectors of the Stroymaterialy plant, and others. 
  Through cooperation between enterprises in 1991, work was 
conducted on the development and inculcation of technologies for 
rendering galvanic products harmless; at present the 
construction of units for rendering mercury lamps harmless is 
being completed at the Elekon PO; work was initiated in 1992 on 
the development of technologies of a plasmaochemical method of 
using toxic industrial wastes, the construction of purification 
facilities for storm drainage in the area of the KMPO [not 
further identified], and the elaboration of project materials 
for starting the processing of solid everyday and industrial 
wastes. A number of city environmental protection measures were 
financed owing to payments by city enterprises. 
  In 1992, 415 motor vehicles were switched to gas fuel, in 
1993--350 units. 
  With Decree No. 1159 dated 22 November 1993 of the head of 
administration of the city of Kazan "Concerning the Planning and 
Construction of 'Ecological Protection' Complexes" in the city 
of Kazan, the Tatar republic scientific production association 
Ecology was established as the buyer and contractor for the 
planning and construction of five "Ecological Protection" 
complexes at entrances into and in the city of Kazan (in the 
system of GAI [State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate], ecological 
monitoring posts, regulation points, car wash facilities with 
cleaning units, gas stations, and service stores). Work is being 
conducted at the present time on setting aside land parcels for 
the complexes. The start of work has been delayed in connection 
with financial difficulties. 
  Starting in the second half of 1990, the city center of 
Gossannadzor organized the "Environment and Health" department 
which, jointly with the KGMI [Kazan State Medical Institute 
imeni S.V. Murashov] and the city health services department, 
conducted a retrospective analysis of the status of the 
population sickness rate of the city (87 medical-preventive 
treatment institutions) within the framework of the all-Union 
program OAZIS [not further identified], "Health." 
  Work is continuing within the framework of the TerKSOP 
program. 
  During the report period the operation of 22 facilities was 
halted. More than 150 materials, on which measures were taken, 
were turned into the environmental protection procuracies. 
  Fines were imposed on more than 100 enterprises and 
organizations. 
  Fifty suits were brought for a sum of more than R15 million. 
The Sanitary-Epidemiologic Service fined 331 persons, 60 cases 
were turned over to the administrative commission, the 
sanitary-epidemiologic commission imposed fines in the sum of 
R192 million, and R130 million was recovered. 
  From information presented to deputies at the 
session.

atmosphere is one of the factors causing a drop in the birth 
rate and an increase in the mortality rate. In 1993 the number 
of births in Vladivostok declined by 13 percent as compared to 
1992. In the same year, one and a half times more people died 
than were born. 
  Vladivostok enterprises discharged into the atmosphere 
691,000 tonnes of pollutants. Of them, 626,000 tonnes were 
intercepted by scrubbers and neutralized. 
  While in 1992 an average of 169 tonnes of pollutants were 
discharged daily, this year the amount increased to 176 tonnes. 
  The greatest culprits in atmospheric pollution are such 
major 
industrial enterprises as AO [joint-stock society] Dalzavod, 
Vladivostok central heat and power station No. 2, 
heat-distribution networks, the oil warehouse, and the maritime 
fishing port. Many of them, in addition to dust, "present" the 
atmosphere with ammonia, hydrocarbons, and a score of other 
hazardous substances. 
  Over the year, 253 tonnes of soot, 1,239 tonnes of dust and 
inorganic compounds, and four tonnes of hydrogen sulfide are 
discharged into the atmosphere. 
  The high level of discharge of hazardous substances--3,000 
tonnes--is produced by means of transportation and 
transportation and road complex enterprises. 
  The ecological policy should be one of priorities for the 
state. People's health depends on it.

<F P=106> [Report by VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Mark Viktorov: "Minimum </F>
Wage Currently Equals the Cost of 13 Loaves of Bread"] 
  [Text] According to the kray statistical 
administration report, the greatest price increases in May were 
registered with respect to for-fee services for the 
population--8.8 percent; prices for foodstuffs and consumer 
goods rose, respectively, by 6.2 percent and 6 percent. 
  Within the foodstuffs category, the greatest price increases 
occurred with respect to cereals--by more than 14 percent. For 
instance, the price of polished rice rose by 17 percent. Prices 
for quick-frozen fish (not including gourmet varieties) rose by 
12.5 percent. 
  The last week, however, was marked by a certain decline in 
prices for milk and products made of it. In particular, milk 
prices declined by 2.1 percent: from R1,096-R1,073 in the kray 
on average. 
  It should be noted that rye bread--whose price, by the way, 
rose by 40 percent last week, from R773 to R1,087 per kg--was 
not available for sale anywhere in the kray except in 
Vladivostok. 
  Despite the fact that, as statistical data show, food prices 
rose at a somewhat slower rate, their range in different cities 
and rayons continues to vary greatly. For instance, prices for 
macaroni items differ by a factor of three: While the cheapest 
macaroni is sold in Vladivostok (R662 a month), the most 
expensive ones are in Pogranichniy Rayon (R2,100). At the same 
time, Vladivostok is the leader in milk products cost. The same 
applies to very expensive meat products and imported sausages. 
As to our own bologna, which is affordable for our population, 
it is practically impossible to find it in the stores. The 
exception is the Vladivostok meat combine's own store. 
  Those whose refrigerator, washing machine, or vacuum cleaner 
broke down, discovered in May that the cost of their repairs 
went up by 25 percent. For instance, the cost of repairing the 
refrigeration unit in a refrigerator increased from R133,000 to 
R165,000. 
  Barber salon services also cost more now. For instance, 
men's 
fancy haircut now costs more than R7,000, and the cost of 
chemical permanent increased to R16,500. 
  The cost of car maintenance service increased over a month 
from R105,000 to R122,000. 
  Prices for tickets for concerts and the circuses increased 
over May by almost one-third. For instance, while in April one 
ticket to a concert cost in the kray on average R20,000, in May 
it cost R26,000. 
  The cost of housing and municipal services increased almost 
1.5-fold over last month. However, as VLADIVOSTOK has already 
reported, beginning 1 June these services will cost many times 
more.

<F P=106> [Article by Radio VVS Editor in Chief Vladimir Oshchenko: </F>
"Radio VVS Is Vladivostok Today--At 1413 kHz Frequency"] 
  [Text] Next week, Radio VVS (Vladivostok Today) will 
commence operations. It will broadcast daily for 14 hours at 
1413 kHz frequency in the medium-wave range (between Youth 
Channel and VBC) from 0700 to 2100. We will publish the precise 
date of the Radio VVS first broadcast as soon as the Vladivostok 
city telephone company completes the work for which it already 
has been paid, the technical substantiation for which has been 
in the works at the telephone company since April. 
  Radio VVS is another information channel owned by AO 
[joint-stock society] Vladivostok-Novosti, which currently 
publishes VLADIVOSTOK, TIKHIY OKEAN, VLADIVOSTOK-REKLAMA, and 
VLADIVOSTOK NEWS newspapers. The need to set up a new radio 
station was dictated first and foremost by the information needs 
of Vladivostok residents. It was also these needs that defined 
the structural basis of Radio VVS programs: 20 minutes of each 
of 14 hours (from 0700 to 2100) will be devoted to news--the 
most current, just-received news. 
  Imagine: On a weekend you are at a dacha or on the sea 
shore... Moscow radio programs are too far removed from the life 
of the Far East and Maritime Kray; besides, when something 
happens here, it is usually the middle of the night in Moscow. A 
portable radio tuned to Radio VVS will bring you all the 
information about events happening in the city and kray. 
  How much did AO Vladivostok-Novosti journalists regret that 
they did not have access to air waves on 14 May! This day is 
remembered for its bad news: the explosion in Novonezhino 
arsenal, evacuation of residents of Romanovka and other 
villages, and, of course, rumors and anxiety. I am convinced 
that there would be fewer rumors had Radio VVS already been in 
operation. Our correspondents knew about the incident one hour 
after it happened, and an AO VLADIVOSTOK-NOVOSTI journalist even 
managed to squeeze into the car that took members of the 
commission for emergency situations to Novonezhino. Maritime 
Kray residents could have listened to reports from the incident 
site as shells were still exploding, and then read the 
VLADIVOSTOK newspaper with all the details and particulars two 
days later. 
  But, of course, this is about more than just emergency 
situations. Numerous events take place in our city and kray that 
any person who feels himself an active member of society would 
find useful to know--be it economic and sociopolitical items or 
the news from everyday life of the city. 
  Some may say: Why set up another radio station in the city 
that already has Radio Vladivostok and VBC? And we will reply: 
The more stations, the better. Each of them has its own audience 
of listeners, and those who do not have a strong preference for 
one particular station simply will have a choice. Besides, let 
us admit it--each radio station has its own specialty: Radio 
Vladivostok has great shows and expensive prizes; VBC has 
innovative advertisement, round-the-clock music. Radio VVS dares 
to make the emphasis in its programming on the latest news about 
the events and life in Vladivostok. Of course, it will be 
supplemented by musical programs. 
  Radio VVS information programs will be anchored by 
journalists whose names are very familiar to VLADIVOSTOK 
readers: Andrey Ostrovskiy, Marina Lobova, Aleksandr Kartashov, 
Sergey Filonenko, Aleksandr Maltsev, Dmitriy Khabalov. The 
programs will be produced by Tatyana Batova, Oleg Erastov, Igor 
Chetverikov, Stanislav Golovach, and Irina Roshchina. 
  Thanks to AO Vladivostok-Novosti's stable economic 
situation, 
Radio VVS is completely independent of political parties, state 
bodies, and commercial and financial structures. This to a large 
extent guarantees objectivity and unprejudiced coverage at our 
radio station. We do not intend to go after superprofits: 
Advertising will occupy no more than one-fifth of broadcast time 
in Radio VVS programs. 
  The transmitter from which Radio VVS programs will be 
broadcast is powerful enough to ensure stable reception on the 
territory of the entire southern part of Maritime Kray--50 kW. 
We are grateful to the staff of Vladivostok Radio Center who 
were able to lease us these broadcast capacities and air time. 
  And we do hope that Vladivostok Today radio will become 
truly 
a necessity for the city and its residents.

<F P=106> [Text of the theses of the Foreign and Defense Policy </F>
Council: "Strategy for Russia (2)"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The "Strategy for Russia" theses of the nongovernment 
Foreign 
and Defense Policy Council [FDPC], published almost two years 
ago, on 19 August 1992, in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, attracted great 
interest on the part of the public and specialists and, to the 
best of our knowledge, seriously influenced the discussion 
around the country's foreign policy course. In approximately one 
year FDPC members could state with justification that the main 
conclusions of the theses and the proposals they contained have 
been proven correct and almost fully implemented. 
  The theses came into being because of FDPC members' concern 
over the fact that the national leadership lacked a minimally 
systematic understanding of Russia's interests and goals in the 
foreign policy sphere, as well as fears that a demonstratively 
one-sided pro-Western policy orientation could not only damage 
Russian Federation [RF] interests in other foreign-policy 
directions, but also would cause an inevitable hard reaction on 
the part of public opinion inside the country. The theses were 
aimed at convincing national leaders that the policy needed to 
be adjusted and this reaction softened. 
  The changes in the Russian foreign policy course that have 
taken place since the end of 1992 have made it much more 
balanced and restrained, and somewhat softened this reaction but 
could not avert it entirely. There are increasingly numerous 
signs that the pendulum of Russian public opinion and Russian 
policy already is passing the "golden middle" and is moving in 
the direction of a policy potentially much more dangerous that 
the one conducted in 1991-1992. 
  The explanation lies not only in past events and mistakes. 
There are forces that exist and operate in Russia, which strive 
to provoke a crisis in relations with the outside world, to 
create again a hostile environment without which they cannot 
even dream of coming into power. 
  The firmer tone and better defined positions that have 
manifested themselves lately in Moscow's foreign policy lead to 
formation of a normal, more equal and respectful nature of 
relations with the leading powers. One cannot fail to notice, 
however, the revival and intensification of xenophobia as well. 
  Under these conditions a number of FDPC members came up with 
an initiative to draft new theses. They have been written by the 
working group of council members who as a rule currently do not 
hold official positions in the bodies of executive authority. 
(Footnote 1)( The working group included: Yu.Yu. Boldyrev, 
deputy of the Federation Council of the RF Federal Assembly; 
L.I. Vainberg, president of the Association of Joint Ventures 
and International Associations and Organizations; A.P. 
Vladislavlev, vice president of the Russian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs; A.C. Grachev, member of the 
MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI founder's council; O.V. Kiselev, chairman of 
the board of directors of AO [joint-stock society] Mosexpo; 
Ye.M. Kozhokin, director of the Russian Institute of Strategic 
Studies; V.P. Lukin, doctor of historic science, professor; 
I.Ye. Malashenko, general director of NTV; M.V. Masarskiy, 
president of the Association of Enterprise Managers; N.V. 
Mikhaylov, president of Vympel Interstate Joint-Stock 
Corporation, doctor of economic sciences, professor; I.M. 
Khakamada, deputy of the RF Federal Assembly State Duma; I.Yu. 
Yurgens, first deputy chairman of the General Confederation of 
Trade Unions; S.N. Yushenkov, chairman of the RF State Duma 
Federal Assembly's Committee on Defense). The group's work 
was coordinated by S.A. Karaganov, a deputy director of the 
Europe Institute of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] and 
the chairman of the FDPC collegium, and V.T. Tretyakov, editor 
in chief of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. In the process of preparing 
these theses, the council has conducted a number of seminars 
with the participation of noted specialists and politicians of 
Russia, Ukraine, the United States, Germany, China, Japan, and 
other countries. Among the materials used were official 
documents, as well as theoretical work of a number of noted 
Russian specialists. (Footnote 2)( Members of the working 
groups used especially extensively the work of the following 
specialists: A.G. Arbatov, D.A. Danilov, P.Ye. Kandel, I.M. 
Klyamkin, A.V. Kortunov, V.V. Naumkin, V.A. Nikonov, K.E. 
Sorokin, S.M. Rogov, P.T. Podlesnyy, V.V. Pazuvayev, D.V. 
Trenin, and K.O. Sarkisov. The authors would like to express a 
special appreciation for A.K. Pushkov, who was a co-author of 
one of the important parts of the report. 
  (Members of the working group would like to thank the 
FDPC Executive Director T.V. Borisova and Deputy Executive 
Director A.A. Belkin for organizational and academic help in 
preparing the theses.) 
  The theses were discussed at the meeting of the FDPC 
Assembly 
on 12 May of 1994 and the results of the discussion were 
incorporated in the draft. 
  Not all planks of the theses necessarily reflect the views 
of 
each member of the working group who put his signature under 
them. Rather, they reflect a broad consensus on their underlying 
philosophy. 
  The authors almost fully reaffirm the appraisal of the 
international situation and the prospects for our country's 
development presented in the 1992 "Strategy for Russia" theses. 
The new theses do not represent an attempt at an 
all-encompassing appraisal of the international situation and 
detailed recommendations on Russia's foreign policy strategy. We 
are gratified to see that state bodies now have engaged in doing 
this. The purpose of the theses is to influence several key 
long-term elements in Russia's policy, first and foremost with 
respect to the countries of the former USSR, as well as attempt 
to warn against some dangerous trends that have emerged in the 
Russian policy. 
<H8>  1. New Elements in Russia's Foreign Policy Situation </H8>
  1.1. A perceptible trend has developed in Russia's foreign 
policy toward a shift from the old one-sided alignment with the 
West to the defense of real national interests. However, it has 
been accompanied lately by great-power rhetorics on the part of 
high officials, aimed first and foremost at domestic 
consumption. This rhetoric, not supported by real economic, 
political, and military levers, can only exacerbate suspicions 
that Russia is aiming for an "imperial revanche" in both the 
near and far abroad. There is presently a danger that Russia may 
start moving from the old policy of unconditional alignment with 
the West and neglect of its relations with neighbors in the 
former USSR to a policy of political confrontation and 
suspiciousness, on the one hand, and high-handedness of 
strength, on the other. 
  1.2. Suspicious attitudes toward Russia undoubtedly are on 
the rise around the world, but at the same time we see a decline 
of interest in it; quite a few signs of lack of respect for 
Russian interests can be detected. 
  The main reason is the progressively weakening Russian 
economy and the lack of a strong economic strategy capable of 
taking the country out of the crisis and starting an economic 
upturn. Russia is relatively weak. But most important, so far no 
short-term prospects for its stabilization and strengthening are 
in sight. 
  The West fears a revival of Russian expansionism. Many do 
not 
want even a partial restoration of Moscow's influence in the 
world policy. It should also be noted that there are many in the 
outside world who are interested in retaining on the territory 
of the former USSR, strategic counterbalances free of Russian 
influence. 
  1.3. For the West, there also are reasons that are purely 
internal as to why a shift has began in relations with Russia. 
To a considerable extent, West Europe temporarily lost the 
capacity for active outward-aimed action because of 
post-Maastricht difficulties, Germany concentrating on 
"digesting" eastern lands, the economic decline, and another fit 
of "Europessimism." There is an increasing desire to shut 
oneself off from the problems whose resolution requires 
political will and economic expenditures. Similar processes and 
orientation, first and foremost toward domestic affairs, also 
are developing in the United States, albeit in a less explicit 
form. The West has demonstrated its inability to seriously 
assist in the Russian reforms or to assist Russia effectively in 
averting and settling crises in the post-Soviet space. (Limited 
aid in both the former and the latter is being rendered, 
however). 
  The inevitable erosion of security structures set up during 
the years of the Cold War begets fears among a part of 
traditional Western elites, the desire to slow down or turn back 
these processes, including with the help of the "rallying 
factor"--by reviving the perception of an outside, that is, 
Russian threat. Both in the West and in Russia there are forces 
that want us to "slip" and provoke a beginning of a new "cold 
war." 
  1.4. At the same time, the forces that wish a return to the 
Cold War do not have an upper hand either in Russia or in the 
West. 
  Moreover, numerous analyses, including those conducted under 
the auspices of the FDPC, show that the conflict between Russian 
vital interests of primary importance and those of the largest 
countries in the West is not great. In most cases these 
interests either coincide or do not contradict each other. The 
conflict emerges only in connection with implementation of 
interests that are of clearly secondary importance. Thus, there 
is no deep underlying reason for worsening relations. 
  1.5. Nevertheless, we face the possibility of such worsening 
in relations, which will mark the beginning of the 
third--"farce"--"cold war" (the first one fell in the 
1950's-1960's, and the second in the beginning of the 1980's). 
It cannot be either deep or intense. But for Russia, in its 
current state of overexertion and weakness, another 
confrontation with the West will cost extremely dearly and may 
derail economic reforms. This--and only under the best-case 
scenario--will lead to stagnation and considerable worsening of 
general conditions of life for Russian citizens as a minimum for 
the lifetime of one generation, and make integration processes 
on the territory of the former USSR more difficult. Moreover, in 
the event the confrontation exacerbates, the West may attempt to 
recreate the system of military-political isolation of Russia 
that will diminish even more its ability to influence the 
outside world, to defend its interests in it. It is conceivable 
that the West also has the ability to contribute to its domestic 
destabilization. 
  The new isolation will be much more damaging than the one in 
which the USSR lived during the years of the first Cold War. 
  1.6. Even without a serious worsening in relations, there 
exists a real threat of qualitative and long-term increase of 
geopolitical isolation of Russia and weakening of its 
international positions, especially if a decision is made to 
expand NATO that would exclude Russia. 
  1.7. Russia has broken out of confrontation. It does not 
have 
any enemies in the foreseeable future and this is a gigantic 
plus in its current geostrategic situation. It is quite obvious, 
however, that the hope of acquiring new allies, first and 
foremost in the West, so far have not materialized. We have not 
succeeded in creating a new effective security system that would 
replace the collapsing two-bloc system and in which Russia could 
feel at least relatively comfortably. At least for the next few 
years Russia will be compelled to live without clear allies and 
be in a "suspended state" in a geostrategic sense. 
  1.8. A qualitatively new situation is developing in most 
"near-abroad" countries. The mood in favor of integration is 
growing. At the same time, the trend toward strengthening 
independent statehood is being replaced by another one--most 
states become weak. An unstoppable economic decline is taking 
place. Many states already are destabilized (the Transcaucasus, 
Tajikistan); others are moving in the same direction. Only the 
Baltic countries, and also (for different reasons) Turkmenistan, 
constitute clear exceptions. One may reach a preliminary 
conclusion that many, if not the majority, of countries that 
formed after the USSR's disintegration, are proving their 
inability to survive as completely independent states outside of 
very close cooperation with Russia, its and each other's support. 
  1.9. There are many reasons for this. The new structure of 
prices, under which Russia stopped playing the role of an 
economic donor, has led to a sharp redistribution of resources 
between former Soviet republics. Little countries suffer to a 
relatively greater degree from the disruption of traditional 
economic ties. All of them experience in most cases a shortage 
of specialists capable of adopting to new economic conditions, 
manage on a macroeconomic level, conduct a reform, and this 
cannot be made up for even in an intermediate-term future. In 
most CIS countries, for all practical purposes market reforms 
are not being implemented. The result of all this is that they 
not only progressively fall behind in relation to Russia, but 
also develop in different directions. The former USSR countries 
(with the exception of the Baltics and Turkmenistan) not only 
are growing increasingly poorer as compared to Russia, the 
differences in the structure of their economies keeps increasing 
as well. 
  1.10. Of particular concern is the situation in Ukraine. Its 
economy is disintegrating fast; there is the absence of 
consolidated political will and minimum accord, and perhaps of 
the ability to implement a resolute reform; the population is 
getting increasingly more impoverished. The disintegration 
process has gone far. As early as within the next one to three 
years Ukraine may have to face a social explosion and the 
beginning of political disintegration. There is a growing mood 
among the population, especially in the southern, eastern, and 
central oblasts, in favor of unification with Russia, as well as 
distrust and rejection of the policy associated with Western 
Ukraine. Most elites at the same time would like to preserve 
some level of state independence. In the foreseeable future 
calls for unification possibly will be coming from individual 
regions or oblasts, which may provoke internal clashes. A stream 
of illegal emigration to Russia is swelling. The manageability 
of the Ukrainian armed forces is declining dangerously. 
  1.11. The situation in Ukraine (but not Ukraine itself) 
currently presents the most serious long-term external challenge 
to the security and internal stability of Russia. Economic 
degradation, internal conflicts portending the threat of mass 
migration, technotronic catastrophes, loss of control over 
nuclear weapons and arsenals of conventional weapons. 
  1.12. Against the backdrop of weakening neighboring states, 
Russia public opinion and political circles, along with the 
general growth of nationalism, manifest an increased perception 
of imaginary omnipotence of Russia. This perception is very 
dangerous. It may result in drawing Russia into a considerable 
number of conflicts aimed at supporting stability in one or 
another country or region or at supporting unification 
processes. Russia, however, does not have either the social, 
military, or economic potential for it. Russia itself is in a 
critical economic situation. A quick overexertion is almost 
inevitable, and with it--increased social instability and 
renewed disintegration tendencies. Russia may very quickly 
follow the road of the USSR and fall apart because of excessive 
strain and insufficient resources. 
  1.13. At the same time, the experience of the last few years 
showed that a complete separation from the republics of the 
former USSR--as had been proposed by radical democrats--is 
impossible. Neither does it seem possible to effectively 
regulate by traditional methods of international diplomacy the 
set of problems that are emerging on the territory of the former 
USSR: sociopolitical conflicts; the legal and economic situation 
of almost 70 million persons living outside their ethnic 
homelands; economic development; borders. Integration with many 
states of the former USSR in a strategic perspective is almost 
inevitable. There is simply no other solution. It is only a 
question of its forms and terms. 
  1.14. No strategy for defense and promotion of national 
interests in the foreign arena--even the most elementary 
one--can be implemented given the current state of the bodies 
whose job it is to develop and implement this strategy. What we 
have is a discordant chorus, where each bureaucrat affords 
himself the luxury of his own policy, which weakens the 
country's foreign political positions and quite often 
embarrasses it. This is one of the greatest challenges facing 
the country's foreign policy. A top to bottom reform of the 
executive branch has not been completed. The capabilities of the 
president's apparat still are not commensurate with the 
president's constitutional prerogatives. 
  1.15. The shortcomings of the current system in the foreign 
political sphere per se in a most general sense boil down to the 
following: 
  1.15.1. So far the president had not devoted sufficient 
attention to the issues of foreign policy and national security; 
in many respects, he removed himself from the dialog with 
society on the foreign policy issues; he clearly does not have 
sufficient bureaucratic capabilities through which he could, at 
least in principle, exercise effective control over the 
formation and implementation of an integrated foreign policy 
strategy. 
  1.15.2. There is still practically no system of strict 
planning and coordination. The Security Council staff over the 
past half-year has increased potential capabilities for 
coordination. It cannot carry out this function effectively, 
however. The key role in defining the policy is still played by 
relevant agencies, which, with all the constant bickering 
between them, are united in one point--the reluctance to 
subordinate to anyone. As a result, the already meager potential 
of the country, the capabilities of the president and the 
presidency in the matters of foreign policy are being sharply 
diminished. 
  1.15.3. A continuous, anticipatory dialog between the bodies 
of executive authority and legislative authority has not been 
set up. As a result, additional impulses are generated for the 
confrontation of two branches of power, as well as obstacles on 
the road of forming a foreign policy consensus. 
  1.15.4. Because of the largely negligent attitude, the 
cadres 
corps, whose task is to serve foreign policy and national 
security, is in a sad state. To a large extent this is true of 
counterintelligence. But an especially alarming situation exists 
with respect to the professional corps of the MFA [Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs]. It is seriously demoralized and losing people. 
As a result, not just the quality of diplomacy suffers. The 
country is losing human resources that cannot be replaced in the 
foreseeable future. 
  1.15.5. Another alarming point is the level of knowledge the 
society and broad leadership circles possess with respect to 
foreign policy problems. There is a shortage of both serious 
analysis and popular coverage of these problems in the mass 
media. As a result, the mind of the public and policy-forming 
circles is filled with myths, falls prey to search for "simple 
solutions" and the worst examples of party propaganda. 
<H8>  What To Do </H8>
<H8>  2. General Considerations </H8>
  2.1. Russia will inevitably see its foreign policy positions 
worsen, and in the future perhaps will face direct threats to 
its territorial integrity unless the national leadership manages 
in the next year or two to self-organize and advance a viable 
concept of national development--first and foremost, for getting 
out of the economic crisis: a new industrial policy designed for 
the long-term perspective, the rescue of scientific-technical 
intelligentsia and advance technologies, the restoration of law 
and order, and the restraint of corruption. The key formula of 
the entire Russian strategy must be "accumulation of strength" 
or, using A.M. Gorchakov's formula, "concentration." Without it 
Russia will not be able to ensure the well-being and freedom of 
its citizens and take the place of a respected and 
self-respecting power in the world. 
  2.2. One of the possible ways to stimulate such 
consolidation, such "accumulation of strength" is to create a 
nongovernment National Strategy Commission. This commission 
could also include representatives of the current 
administration--however, not for political oversight or guidance 
but just to enrich the unrestricted analysis of possible 
alternatives with information and ideas not available to people 
who are not part of the ruling structures. This commission could 
produce a long-term program of national development, around 
which a platform could emerge for uniting responsible and 
future-oriented economic and political leaders, the active part 
of the society. We have to honestly admit that so far none of 
the parties, nor the government, nor the president in his 
message to the Federal Assembly have been able to advance such a 
long-term program, although they have identified many of its 
essential elements. 
<H8>  3. Policy Toward Former USSR Countries </H8>
  It is no longer possible to conduct any policy toward the 
countries of the former USSR without defining clear strategic 
goals. Russia must decide in the very near future what it wants. 
Effective and long-term solution of the second-tier 
tasks--maintaining stability, establishing economic and 
financial cooperation, ensuring human rights, military-political 
interaction, and so on--is impossible unless these tasks are 
built into the overall strategy and subordinated to a single 
goal. The low efficiency of Russian policy over the past two 
years with respect to CIS countries and the fact that the 
organization is in a skid is a vivid testimony to this. 
  3.2. The disintegration of the USSR, despite likely being a 
historic inevitability, brought deprivation and a decline in the 
standard of living and quality of life for most people of the 
former USSR and has led to a succession of conflicts that has 
yet to reach the end. But such a conclusion should not push us 
toward a policy that may lead to even greater losses and 
suffering. 
  3.3. The boundaries of Russia's strategic choice are 
extremely narrow if we keep in mind first and foremost the 
progressive weakening of the majority of neighboring states, the 
growing instability in them, which has exceeded or is about to 
exceed the critical mark, the shift of the moods there in favor 
of integration, and the emerging balance of attitudes in the 
ruling groups in Russia itself. The different direction of 
Russian economic development and other countries of the former 
USSR; the lack of ability or desire to coordinate its interests 
with long-term interests of all countries; the lack of real 
experience of modern integration; and the political, social, and 
military-political instability make the idea of creating a 
EU-type community on the territory of the greater part of the 
former USSR increasingly less realistic even in the 
intermediate-range term. 
  3.4. Essentially, Russia is left with just one alternative: 
Either a course toward reuniting with the considerable number of 
former USSR republics--or in the event of their disintegration, 
with their regions--and creating a new federative state; or a 
course toward preserving political independence of these states 
in exchange for unlimited access to their markets of goods, 
services, and capital, creating an effective defensive 
military-political union, and providing a single legal space for 
all ethnic minorities that will ensure their full rights. That 
is, integration not through territorial and political 
unification, but through creation of political, 
military-political, and other conditions for economic 
interaction and interpenetration, which in turn should ensure 
and support political and military-political interests of Russia 
on the territory of the former USSR. Of course, the policy 
should provide conditions for such an integration as well in the 
event this trend becomes objectively predominant. 
  3.5. The goal of creating (or recreating) a federative state 
is too costly in political terms and especially in economic 
terms. Absolutely unacceptable are ultranationalists' 
recipes--reunification through strong-arm expansion, by 
undermining in a controlled way the stability of neighboring 
states. Such a policy is not only immoral--it is also 
impractical: Instability will inevitably spill over into Russia 
itself. However, the course toward reunification may turn out 
counterproductive even when purely economic and political levers 
are used: It will require gigantic infusions of money into 
frequently collapsing economic entities, direct subsidies to 
prop the population's standard of living in the neighboring 
states in order to make it at least comparable with that in 
Russia. Russia is in danger of turning again into an economic 
colony of states it will unite around itself. Considering the 
current standard of living in Russia itself, its inevitable 
sharp decline may lead to an explosion of social discontent and 
increased disintegration trends in Russia itself, when the 
regions, in order to avoid dramatic destabilization of the 
social situation, will be compelled to resort to a save-yourself 
policy. In this case, any industrial policy will be doomed from 
the start, society's modernization will be reversed, and a 
national strategy of accumulation of strength and restoration 
will be impossible. Overexertion is almost inevitable, and 
because of this overexertion and the shortage of resources, 
Russia may quickly go the way of the USSR. 
  The policy toward unification will cause inevitable sabotage 
and resistance on the part of a considerable part of local 
elites. Besides, they will be to a considerable extent absolved 
of the responsibility for economic disintegration, 
impoverishment of the population, and instability. They will get 
an opportunity, even greater than before, to shift the 
responsibility onto Moscow. 
  Finally, an open course toward full integration, especially 
with Ukraine, may cause tensions in relations with the outside 
world, and the rise of already-obvious anti-Russian moods. This 
will create difficulties in utilizing outside sources of growth: 
technologies, capital, societal management and social 
development expertise. The probability of NATO's expansion will 
sharply increase, and the danger of overexertion will increase 
even more. 
  3.6. Russia should not support just any integration--only 
that which will be beneficial for Russians and the Russian 
state. We also have to recognize the right of our neighbors to 
such a policy of "enlightened egotism." 
  3.7. The policy aimed at creating around Russia a system of 
friendly states, nonconfrontational toward Russia and 
economically open to it, also is not going to be cheap--both 
from the standpoint of political effort and from a purely 
economic standpoint. But this strategy is qualitatively cheaper 
and more profitable. Russia will not have to bear direct 
responsibility for maintaining the standard of living of the 
population of neighboring states. It will be able to avoid a 
return to the position of economic donor, and will be able to 
utilize to the full extent its advantages--natural resources, 
the technological potential, on average more skilled labor force 
and managerial cadres. It will have access to the natural, 
economic, and human resources of neighboring countries on a 
basis relatively more advantageous for it. The goal of 
such policy is not to restore with some modification the 
situation that existed before the disintegration of the USSR, 
but to modernize these relations in a way advantageous for 
Russia, whereby it will retain many advantages of its former 
geostrategic position and at the same time create for itself a 
much more advantageous economic position in the new commonwealth 
of states. The philosophy of this approach is "leadership 
instead of direct control." 
  3.8. Russia has the right to propose development of some 
model of interaction with the neighboring countries, but it 
should not impose it the hard way. And especially so by force. 
The people and the leadership of the neighboring countries must 
make their own choice. But the price of refusal also should be 
made quite clear from the very beginning: reducing the 
incentives for economic, political, or military-political 
support on the part of Russia. 
  Such a formula will probably cause less resistance in the 
outside world, since it will not lead to a qualitatively greater 
military-political power of Russia and at the same time will 
ensure the opportunities for stabilizing the situation in the 
space of the former USSR. 
  Apparently, only after getting out of the crisis, 
successfully implementing economic reform, and achieving a sharp 
rise in economic might and prosperity will Russia be able to 
afford a closer integration with those former USSR republics 
that will want it and if it is advantageous for Russia itself. 
  3.9. The concrete directions of Russia's actions in 
implementing the policy based on the "leadership instead of 
control" philosophy could be the following: 
  3.9.1. Insist on removing all restrictions on the movement 
of 
goods, on creating conditions for the capital of all countries 
to participation in privatization; transfer of industrial and 
other assets in exchange for debt. Active support on the part of 
all states for interpenetration of capital. 
  3.9.2. Create an effective system of mutual clearing, first 
on a bilateral basis, and then possibly by creating a clearing 
union with a reserve currency. At the same time, complete 
integration of financial systems should be avoided. The example 
of Belarus should be an exception rather than the rule (although 
its repetition cannot be completely precluded) because of the 
closeness of this country to Russia and its strategic position. 
It is necessary to attentively study the experience, benefits, 
and costs of economic integration with Belarus. 
  3.9.3. A course at creating a close military-political union 
of a considerable part of the former USSR states in the future, 
possibly with unified armed forces. 
  3.9.4. A course toward the right of all former USSR citizens 
to have a second citizenship (Footnote 3:) (On the issue of 
second (or dual) citizenship, the opinions of FDPC members were 
polarized. This thesis is left in the text more as an indication 
of a problem than as a commonly recognized version of its 
solution), and protection from any discrimination. 
  3.10. These goals might be achieved through following means: 
  3.10.1. The main principles of the policy must be 
flexibility. In addition to several fundamental principles, the 
policy with respect to each country should be formed on the 
basis of concrete conditions and concrete interests of Russia. 
The line toward strengthening the CIS must be continued, but it 
will not bring effective results without a stronger emphasis on 
bilateral forms of interaction in relations with former USSR 
states. Multilateral diplomacy within the CIS framework should 
develop on the foundation of new bilateral relations, in which 
Russia occupies stronger positions than in the system of 
multilateral contacts. 
  3.10.2. Within the framework of general strategic 
principles, 
Russia has to have a separately developed line with respect to 
each of the states of the former USSR. These lines may differ 
substantially from one another. 
  3.10.3. A consistent and energetic interaction with the 
responsible political forces of neighboring states. 
  3.10.4. Conduct policy aimed at preventing disintegration of 
neighboring states, preserving the main internationally 
recognized attributes of their statehood. At the same time, 
Russia cannot become a guarantor of preservation of the regimes 
that have shown the inability to govern their countries or that 
violate the rights of ethnic minorities, including the Russian 
one. 
  3.10.5. Limit interference in internal affairs other than in 
instances of gross and mass-scale violations of human rights, or 
unleashing civil wars that require peacekeeping measures in 
keeping with the UN Charter. The concept of Russia's special 
responsibility should not lead to a sharp expansion of Russia's 
participation in settling the conflicts. Moscow should stick to 
the principle: the less direct involvement, the better. At the 
same time, this principle cannot be made into an absolute--as 
experience shows, in some instances early intervention may 
prevent protracted conflicts with serious bloodshed. 
  3.10.6. All possible support for the export of capital to 
spheres profitable for Russia; support for establishing direct 
ties between oblasts, rayons, cities, and enterprises. 
  3.10.7. Purposeful efforts aimed at preserving the positions 
of Russian language; increasing at state expense the training of 
specialists from neighboring states in Russian institutions of 
higher learning. 
  3.10.8. Russia's policy toward the countries of the former 
USSR must be aimed at protecting the rights of all ethnic 
minorities. The Russian flag, Moscow must become symbols of 
guarantees of minority rights, protection from aggressive 
nationalism, from wars and violence. At the same time, on its 
own it needs to direct its policy toward the protection of 
rights and interests of Russian abroad. In this connection it 
appears expedient to create a special state organ coordinating 
the work of relevant ministries and agencies. 
  3.10.9. Taking into account the specificities of history, 
geography, and culture of the Baltic states, Russia must have a 
special policy with respect to these countries, aimed at 
building good-neighbor relations with them as they proceed with 
a civilized solution of the problem of ethnic minorities there 
and on the condition of taking into account legitimate interests 
of Russian security. 
  3.10.10. The course on "leadership instead of control" is 
far 
from ideal, including in the opinion of the authors of these 
theses. However, it represents the least evil. At the same time, 
of all politically available realistic options it seems to meet 
to the greatest extent the interests of both Russia and 
Russians, and those of citizens of neighboring states interested 
((as published--line(s) missing)) 
<H5>  4. Policy Toward the Outside World </H5>
  4.1. A slow but steady erosion of the security system 
created 
over the years of the Cold War; the diverse and broad geographic 
spread of Russia's political and economic interests; its current 
relative weakness; the obstacles preventing quick rapprochement 
with the West, which have become apparent by now, require that 
we conduct a flexible policy of balancing between the centers of 
power, build dynamically the balance of force with individual 
states and individual regions that would be advantageous for 
Russia. 
  4.2. The line of rejecting the costly globalist policy must 
be continued. The policy must be maximally economical and 
commensurate with current abilities. At the same time, Russia 
must boost its policy of cooperation and presence in those 
regions where there is interest in such cooperation and where it 
may bring economic dividends and increase the country's general 
political influence. This includes, for example, India, Greece, 
Bulgaria, Southeast Europe as a whole, and the Near East. 
  We need to continue the policy aimed at developing relations 
as friendly and close as possible with China. 
  There is the potential for Russian foreign policy to boost 
its presence in the Asian-Pacific region, and interaction within 
it with the United States, China, and Japan. 
  4.3. At the same time, because of historic, geographic, and 
cultural specificities of our country, the economic and 
technological might of the West, as well as the fact that Russia 
at this point does not have natural allies in the South and the 
East, its long-term goal should be to establish a stable 
realistic partnership, and in the future perhaps a strategic 
association, with the northern belt countries--from the United 
States and Canada to Japan, gradually involving in it China and 
other states. We should continue the course toward including 
Russia--and later possibly China--in the activities of the "Big 
Seven"--first on a political level. 
  4.4. It is necessary to conduct a policy aimed at avoiding 
the unneeded increase of tensions with the West and, on the 
contrary, to aim at establishing with it as close an interaction 
as possible in the areas where it is possible--not, however, at 
the expense of Russia giving up its own interests, but through 
their greater coordination. The dominant contents of relations 
should be stable cooperation while expanding the field of 
partnership where our interests and the concept for a problem 
resolution coincide (for example, nuclear nonproliferation and 
other spheres of military-strategic interaction, especially with 
the United States). Nor should we preclude a limited and 
controlled competition along certain lines (for instance, arms 
trade). 
  4.5. The interests of avoiding isolation and preserving 
influence in relations with West Europe, preventing a return to 
a military confrontation in Europe, and creating in the future 
an effective system of common European security of which Russia 
would be a full-fledged member, require preservation of the 
semi-demilitarized belt of states that has emerged in the center 
of Europe, preventing NATO's expansion, and broadening the 
dialog between Russia and NATO, which in the future would make 
the issue of expanding the bloc without Russian participation in 
its activities moot. Expansion of the zone of prosperity and 
stability to include the countries of Central and East Europe 
and the fastest possible inclusion of these countries into the 
EU would be in Russian national interests overall. 
  4.6. It is necessary to sharply increase the intensity of 
Russian policy in Europe and the efforts aimed at creating in a 
long-term future an effective system of collective European 
security or at least at preventing the creation of a system that 
would exclude Russia to some degree. Keeping in mind the 
possibility of NATO's expansion without Russian participation, 
it is necessary to increase the efforts to search for 
alternative ways to ensure Russia's security and political 
interests in Europe. 
  4.7. Also necessary are special efforts to support and 
expand 
an intensive dialog and interaction with the leading countries 
of the West, especially with Germany and the United States. 
  4.8. In order to attenuate possible irritants in relations 
with the outside world associated with the activation of 
integration processes on the territory of the former USSR, it is 
expedient to involve the West and other states in an intensive 
bilateral dialog on these problems. 
  4.9. We should not allow the necessary shift in Russian 
diplomacy's tone in relations with the West in the direction of 
greater independence and equal standing to become a goal in 
itself, and the enchantment with words to lead to a new 
alienation between Russia and the most advanced and powerful 
countries. Russia's realization of its status as one of the 
leading great powers must proceed on the basis of restoration of 
its economy, the use of existing and the creation of new levers 
to influence the situation, the strengthening of Russia's 
positions on the territory of the former USSR rather than 
through aggressive rhetoric that inflicts direct damage on the 
national interests. 
<H8>  5. Organizational Measures </H8>
  5.1. The main task is to create conditions for the maximum 
concentration and coordination of resources and actions of all 
agencies toward protection and advancement of foreign policy 
interests of the society and the state. Building an effective 
structure of organs whose task is to protect the national 
interests in the foreign arena is a task of no lesser priority 
than developing the policy itself. Specifically, we consider it 
expedient to take the following steps: 
  5.1.1. Considerably increase the president's attention to 
foreign policy issues. Dramatically increase the role of 
presidential structures in its formulation and coordination, 
while retaining the democratic balance and constitutional 
responsibility of all branches of authority, including a strong 
parliament. 
  5.1.2. Create in the president's apparat--with the possible 
utilization or involvement of the Security Council's apparat, or 
on the basis of it--structures capable of effective policy 
coordination, possessing personnel capabilities commensurate 
with the task and, most important, a proper authorization from 
the president. We do not want to preclude the possibility of 
raising MFA potential in matters of foreign policy coordination. 
Experience tells us, however, that its potential is limited, 
especially in the part associated with the policy toward the 
countries of the former USSR. 
  5.1.3. For the president's apparat and under the president's 
supervision, to develop, with the participation of agencies and 
interagency commissions of the Security Council, continuously 
updated directives on individual lines of security policy, in 
particular, on foreign policy. After being approved by the 
Security Council and the president, these directives must become 
mandatory. Violation and nonfulfillment of them without the 
president's concurrence on each individual issue must lead to a 
practically automatic dismissal of officials permitting such a 
violations. 
  5.1.4. Create a sufficiently powerful structure that would 
be 
commensurate with the task, capable of formulating in a 
comprehensive and effective manner and coordinating 
implementation of the policy toward each of the countries of the 
former USSR. This may be done by creating a corresponding 
department with country desks in the president's apparat, in the 
Security Council apparat, by raising the status of the Ministry 
on CIS Affairs and creating in it country desks possessing 
personnel capabilities and prerogatives to coordinate the 
activities of agencies, or through a corresponding strengthening 
of the MFA. There probably are other options. One thing is 
clear--it is impermissible to continue the status quo. 
  5.1.5. It is expedient to set up a special unit in the 
president's apparat that would conduct state information 
activities on the issue of foreign policy in strict coordination 
with the MFA. 
  5.2. Special measures of an organizational, as well as a 
financial and moral nature, must be implemented in order to save 
and strengthen the cadres corps of the diplomatic establishment, 
the officer corps of enforcement ministries, whose role at the 
current stage of our history will inevitably grow not only from 
the standpoint of maintaining internal stability, but also in 
conducting a policy of prevention and regulation of crises in a 
number of regions of the former USSR, collection of relevant 
information, and support of the political and economic interests 
of Russia. 
  5.3. Keeping in mind the increasing influence of the armed 
forces in modern political life of Russia, the state leadership, 
and first and foremost the Ministry of Defense itself, as well 
as the leadership of other enforcement ministries, should not 
only facilitate development of civilian control over the armed 
forces, but also develop and implement a program for integrating 
the officer corps into civilian society. It is also necessary to 
develop a comprehensive program for raising the social status 
and prestige of military service. Rapprochement with and support 
for the officer corps is also a task for new elites, first and 
foremost entrepreneurs, who have a stake in the country's stable 
development. 
  5.4. Members of the working group do not claim that the 
recommendations on reforming the bodies involved in foreign 
policy are exhaustive. It is clear, however, that a reform is 
long overdue. The current situation inflicts serious damage on 
the country's international positions and prestige, and weakens 
its national security.

<F P=106> [MOSCOW NEWS correspondent Irina Lagunina interview with </F>
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, date and place not 
given, followed by MOSCOW NEWS commentary: "Russia-NATO: Will 
Moscow Secure `Special Relations'?"; first paragraph is 
introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] After numerous proposals regarding Russia's 
participation in NATO, Boris Yeltsin suggested in Bonn what is 
expected to be the final variant: Moscow will sign a 
presentation agreement on joining the Partnership for Peace and 
simultaneously will create an additional protocol specifying 
this program. In this connection RF Foreign Minister Andrei 
Kozyrev gave an interview to MN diplomatic analyst 
Irina Lagunina on the fate of the Partnership, Russia and NATO. 
  "We have nothing against the framework document as such, nor 
did we have anything against it from the very beginning. It is a 
different matter that it is not quite sufficient. Our public 
opinion, perhaps thanks to the mass media, tends to believe that 
the Partnership means very serious relations for many years. In 
fact, however, this three-page framework document is not only 
not a wedding, but not even an invitation to the movies. 
  "When a crisis broke out around Gorazde, man in the Duma 
started saying: we are signing a treaty on the Partnership, but 
NATO has not even consulted us over air strikes. But in fact the 
framework document does not even make provision for such 
consultations. 
  "Thinking of how to combine the expectations generated by 
the 
very words Partnership for Peace with the real content of the 
program, we have come to the conclusion that there is a need to 
speak about closer cooperation with NATO. Moreover, as we see 
it, it is Moscow that must draw up a more in-depth program of 
relations -- in the given case it comes forward as the 
"customer" and singles out the lines which it considers to be 
the most interesting and useful for itself. 
  "Now such a document has for the most part been created. 
However, it still calls for discussion in NATO and with the 
other states-partners in order to build relations on the basis 
of reciprocity. As regards the main lines of cooperation in 
which Russia is interested, they are as follows: 
  "First, cooperation between military departments, commands 
and headquarters on account at the fact that these are relations 
between the two mightiest war machines with global potential and 
global responsibility. 
  "Second, the problems of conversion. Moscow has a stake in 
getting both additional investments and technological exchange 
in the framework of partner relations with NATO. The current 
Partnership for Peace program, however, envisages at best 
seminars on conversion. 
  "Third, expanded cooperation in fields such as the 
maintenance of peace, the conduct of joint maneuvers and 
exercises. And, lastly, political consultations and, possibly, 
mutual coordination of positions." 
  MN Commentary 
  It should be presumed that it is these four points that form 
the basis of the protocol drafted by Moscow. The most heated 
debates will undoubtedly be triggered by the last point, as 
political consultations are not envisaged in the Partnership for 
Peace program. However, the latest Bosnian crisis has shown that 
they are indispensable, especially if NATO intends to continue 
engaging in peace-keeping activities. 
  All the signs point that the draft protocol has been 
compiled 
jointly by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of 
Defense of the Russian Federation. On the whole it runs counter 
to the sentiments of some Russian circles which still believe 
that after the disbandment of the Warsaw Treaty Organization, 
NATO must also dissolve itself, and therefore it is not worth 
strengthening this organization through a partnership with 
Russia. The document is rather consistent with the directly 
opposite view: there are still many threats in the world, and if 
there is a military structure possessing sufficient organization 
and might for combatting them, there is a need to find a role 
for this structure. 
  Contrary to expectations and rumors, Kozyrev makes no 
mention 
of Russia's "special responsibility" in the CIS. Moscow has 
evidently decided not to introduce into the protocol additional 
points of dispute. All the more so since many member-states of 
the CIS have already signed the Partnership. A realistic 
analysis has shown that the North Atlantic Alliance is not yet 
ready psychologically, organizationally or physically to spread 
its military-political influence to the space of the former 
Soviet Union even if the CIS states wished this. 
  The additional protocol will be presented to NATO for 
consideration by Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev on May 
24 during his visit to Brussels. 
  The problem for Moscow that, have delayed the signing of the 
framework document, Russia now simply cannot confine itself to 
this step alone, and the signing of any other agreement is not 
envisaged in the framework of the Partnership. Judging by the 
results of the meetings in Geneva between Andrei Kozyrev and 
Warren Christopher, the United States understands this problem. 
This does not mean, however, that any easy time will be in store 
for the Russian protocol in Brussels.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Karpov: "Rules of Bon Ton for the `Nine'" </F>
  [Text] Paris-- 
<H5>  The European Stability Pact Conference, Which Opened </H5>
Yesterday in Paris, Is Designed To Define Them"] 
  The idea of the conclusion of a European Stability Pact, 
which was put forward, as we know, by French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur immediately upon assuming office in April 1993, 
has been transformed into a collective initiative of the EU, 
Russia welcomed it from the very outset, according to Foreign 
Minister A. Kozyrev, since it "is consonant with Russia's work 
on a strengthening of stability on the European Continent." 
  In the opinion of Balladur, which is shared by the Russian 
side, the launch conference in Paris should signify the start of 
a process of signing bilateral agreements and treaties and the 
organization of a number of roundtables for negotiations of a 
bilateral or regional nature on the consideration of regional 
aspects of good-neighbor relations between different countries. 
A third party would participate in them also, which would make 
it possible to impart to them greater objectivity. The EU and 
its bodies or individual members could act in this capacity. It 
is contemplated subsequently to summarize the agreements reached 
in the course of this process in the text of the European 
Stability Pact. 
  It is perfectly obvious that this initiative is addressed to 
the nine states of Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic who 
are endeavoring to become members of the EU. Before the opening 
of the Paris conference, Alain Juppe, French minister of foreign 
affairs, declared that it was designed "to define the rules of 
bon ton" for these countries without, nonetheless, establishing 
conditions of admittance for them. 
  The main factors causing concern are the inter-nation and 
interethnic conflicts and the position of national minorities. 
They are typical to this extent or the other of practically each 
of the nine countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the 
Baltic. It is emphasized that the conference will exclude from 
its field of vision the crises in Bosnia, Crimea, and the 
Caucasus. They erupted long since, and the tasks of the European 
Stability Pact are primarily to exclude new ones arising. 
  Little is said about Russia's role in the conclusion of the 
European Stability Pact. According to Kozyrev, it "is ready, of 
course, to make its contribution in the form that we deem 
expedient." In his speech at the Paris conference, the minister 
emphasized repeatedly the role and significance of the CSCE in 
the building of a new Europe, stressing that "matters pertaining 
to borders, as, equally, national minorities, should be 
discussed exclusively within the framework established by 
documents of the CSCE...." 
  One further distinguishing feature of the future pact will 
be 
its political, not military, character. Alain Juppe, in 
particular, pointed to this, and Andrey Kozyrev declared plainly 
that "the present conference benefits from the fact that 
questions of stability in Europe are being framed here from the 
angle of democracy and human rights, not in a military context." 
  Kozyrev simultaneously also supported military-political 
change finding its place in the channel of broader efforts. He 
confirmed that Russia would, in affiliating with the Partnership 
for Peace, sign a corresponding framework document with NATO 
together with a substantive program of cooperation, which, "of 
course, will reflect Russia's special role as a nuclear power." 
"We are for a deepening of the equal partnership of Russia and 
NATO without mutual vetoes and surprises," Kozyrev emphasized. 
  After his speech, Edouard Balladur had a conversation with 
Andrey Kozyrev lasting almost an hour. Russia's role in the 
settlement of European conflicts, which France values highly, 
was discussed. The Russian side expressed particular concern at 
the slowdown in the process of Russia's membership of European 
structures. Balladur assured Kozyrev that all objections on the 
part of France had now been removed and that he saw no obstacles 
to Russia's membership in European institutions.

<F P=106> [Article by Pavel Felgengauer: "Partnership and Social </F>
Accord"] 
  [Text] The Partnership for Peace program was thought up in 
Washington last year to somehow protect NATO against the East 
European countries that were insistently attempting to join the 
alliance. The speedy membership of NATO by Poland, Hungary, the 
Czech Republic, and others could, in the opinion of Western 
politicians, have signified an intensification of extreme 
nationalist ("pro-empire") sentiments in Moscow. In addition, 
pragmatists in the Pentagon fairly assumed that NATO's 
accelerated expansion eastward would rapidly have reduced to 
nothing the military value of the alliance, having converted it 
(considering the principle of unanimity in all decisionmaking) 
into a second CSCE. 
  The quite indefinite and nonbinding conditions of 
participation in the Partnership program had to satisfy all. It 
was not even considered necessary to consult the former members 
of the Warsaw Pact, including Russia, in advance, about a 
framework document being offered for signature immediately. As a 
result, all NATO's future "partners" were unhappy to this extent 
or the other. But, whereas the other East European countries 
subscribed to the program, nonetheless, Russia, unexpectedly for 
the West, refrained. The Russian military, as perfectly 
pragmatic people, saw no specific advantages for the army in the 
signing of the framework document. 
  But, it is not the military that determines foreign policy 
in 
Moscow. When, in March, the decision to subscribe was adopted, 
the Ministry of Defense officially supported it. But, in April, 
Kozyrev's promised visit to Brussels for the signing was 
postponed indefinitely. Formally, in connection with the 
American aircraft's attack on Serb positions near Goradze 
without prior consultation with Moscow. But the main thing, 
obviously, was to obtain support in the "opposition" ranks for 
the Social Accord Treaty. 
  Western politicians found themselves in an absurd position: 
Without Moscow's participation, the none too intelligible 
program finally became totally meaningless. In the course of the 
session in Brussels during 24-25 May, the NATO defense ministers 
did everything possible to keep the Partnership afloat, and the 
Russian defense minister helped them as best he could. General 
Grachev announced that "Russia will subscribe to the program 
without any prior conditions," and Western politicians publicly 
welcomed this. True, at the same time Pavel Grachev once again 
confirmed that Russia would like to "unconditionally" sign the 
framework document only simultaneously with a supplementary 
protocol or agreement that sets forth in detail the mutual 
obligations of NATO in respect to Russia and of Russia in 
respect to NATO in the political and military spheres. He also 
proposed a system of permanent consultations. "Now NATO must 
decide whether it accepts our partnership or not" (Pavel Grachev 
in Brussels, reverse translation from the English). 
  In any event, Russia's formal affiliation to the program 
has, 
evidently, been postponed until NATO understands what kind of 
protocol, in fact, Russia needs. Meanwhile, nothing is 
preventing preservation of the pro-government majority composed 
of the former "opposition" that took shape in the course of the 
first Duma vote on the budget. The Partnership can wait. 
Especially since the framework agreement is open for signing at 
any time.

<F P=106> [Interview with Marshal Ye. Shaposhnikov by Andrey Uglanov; </F>
place and date not given: "Partnership for NATO?"] 
  [Text] This man was the last defense minister of the 
USSR, the sole commander in chief of the CIS Joint Armed Forces, 
and secretary of the Security Council of Russia. Today Marshal 
of Aviation Ye. Shaposhnikov is the representative of the 
president of the Russian Federation at the Rosvooruzheniye State 
Company--an organization selling Russian weapons overseas. 
Perhaps this appointment signifies the twilight of his military 
career. But, in the opinion of a number of political scientists, 
a pretty good political future might await him, given a certain 
confluence of circumstances and his own desire. 
  [Uglanov] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, your opinion of the Armed 
Forces of Russia. What awaits them? We know that the situation 
in the Army is very difficult. 
  [Shaposhnikov] Next year it will, evidently, be even worse. 
Three groups of factors are affecting the Army at this time. The 
first is the lack of funding. We are today increasing 
the funding of its upkeep thanks to a reduction in defense 
contracting. But there will be nowhere to get the money from 
next year. The second--destructive processes in the 
Army continue. The reason for them, all else aside, is the loss 
of an ideological reference point in the form of an enemy image 
and the absence of effective institutions of educational work. 
The third factor is the appearance of regional 
influence on the Army. The leaders of certain regions are 
flirting with the Army, laying claim to the role of its saviors. 
If these three factors come together in one point at one and the 
same time, there will be an explosion which could signify the 
Army's uncontrollability. 
  [Uglanov] A very dim prospect. 
  [Shaposhnikov] Lest this happen, it is essential to do three 
things, that is, create the conditions for a radical reform of 
the Army. The first concerns the strategic missile 
forces. It is essential to upgrade their combat readiness, 
manning level, and hardware provision as the basis of the Armed 
Forces. As long as we have them, no one will touch us. 
  The second is the strengthening and upgrading of 
the border forces. And the third is the observance of 
legality and law and order and the organization of an all-out 
offensive against crime in all its manifestations. Having thus 
protected ourselves against possible aggression from outside and 
having secured order within the state, it will be possible 
embarking on the building of a new army, taking the path of both 
reforms and reductions. 
  [Uglanov] But, aside from the Army, there are tens of 
millions of people employed in the military-industrial complex. 
This is a delayed-action bomb. An explosion is expected from day 
to day. A strike of the military-industrial complex is, 
apparently, scheduled for 9 June. 
  [Shaposhnikov] Studying military-technical cooperation with 
foreign countries, I discovered serious problems. More than just 
our opportunities to export arms and military equipment will 
depend on their resolution. I am talking about our capacity for 
supplying the Russian Army with modern arms and, consequently, 
for successfully defending ourselves in case of need. This 
depends on the state of the military-industrial complex. 
  The label of "red conservatives" has, I regret to say, been 
pinned on the leaders of defense industry. In reality, this is 
the most patriotic, law-abiding part of our society. Their sole 
shortcoming is a blind faith in state structures that have 
proven powerless to do anything for them. Whence the talk about 
the formation of their own political party, a merger with the 
commercial banks, and so forth. It is for this reason, I 
believe, that Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin has, for all that, 
concerned himself with this problem. 
  [Uglanov] But we have always earned terrific money from arms 
sales. Why not allocate it for the development of the defense 
industry? 
  [Shaposhnikov] Strictly speaking, in Soviet times we were 
never involved in the sale of arms. They were supplied according 
to the principle: "You respect me? You support my socialism? 
Here you are, then." Tens of billions of dollars were lost, and 
their return is greatly in doubt. The USSR leaders wanted to 
gratify the world by their inordinate kindness. We were regarded 
as fools. 
  [Uglanov] But we were paid for the weapons, all the same.... 
  [Shaposhnikov] We received in exchange cheap, often sour, 
wine, tomatoes, some pieces of this and that, and so on and so 
forth. The year of 1985, for example, was the high point in 
military-technical export cooperation. On the basis of such 
principles of the arms "trade" we concluded agreements totaling 
$16 billion and received in actual terms on the order of $2 
billion. But where these billions went, no one knows. Into the 
"granary of the motherland," evidently. 
  Today the plants and regions themselves are going to the 
president and the government: "We are dying--allow us to move 
onto the market." Many were allowed. And when they went 
overseas, people locally were astonished by our insanity. Some 
12-15 individuals and organizations would move after one and the 
same deal, one and the same contract. They were competing with 
one another, thereby knocking down their prices. The president 
decided to close off all these loopholes and to retain one 
channel for the sale of weapons--the Rosvooruzheniye. Although 
the role of manufacturer should not be belittled, this should be 
done in the channel of state laws and interests. 
  [Uglanov] You hold the cards here. You are a person who 
knows 
weapons and you are, furthermore, a pilot. Is it mainly aviation 
equipment that is being sold? 
  [Shaposhnikov] You are right. If we take 100 percent as 
being 
the total, aviation accounts for 60-70 percent. 
  [Uglanov] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, you had your finger on the 
nuclear trigger. The operational situation throughout the world 
was reported to you daily. You must see some common development 
of events from the viewpoint of the "warmup" of conflicts 
throughout the world. How may they be extinguished, how may the 
armed forces of blocs and individual states be used? Do you have 
any thoughts in this connection? Is it right that Russia is 
being pulled into NATO's Partnership for Peace program? 
  [Shaposhnikov] After World War II, mankind behaved like a 
handful of street toughs. But we have reached a point where 
there is no more Warsaw Pact and no more Soviet Union, but nor 
is there at the same time clearly expressed opposition. And 
military power has lost its precise, clear reference point in 
the enemy image. This is understood by the leaders of NATO also, 
and they have for several years now been in the mode of search 
and explanations of their existence. Organizing the Partnership 
for Peace is one such find. 
  Will Russia gain or lose from the Partnership? Let us 
consider three scenarios. The first is the signing of 
the treaty without reservations. In this case NATO's influence 
would extend to the Pacific, to the borders of China, which does 
not accept the Partnership as yet. This could signify a conflict 
with our southeastern neighbor, which neither we nor China need. 
The second scenario is a refusal to sign. Russia 
would then be putting itself under conditions of isolation from 
the Western world. NATO's borders would become closer to our 
borders. Consequently, a new confrontation, a cold war, of which 
the world has grown tired, is possible on this basis. The 
third scenario is that of us seeking some special 
role for ourselves in NATO or in the Partnership. I believe that 
this is unworthy of a great Russia. Consequently, Russia should 
propose to the world community something else worthy of its 
authority and shared by the world community. 
  The time has now come, in my view, for thought to be given 
the concept of states' nonbloc existence. Mankind does not need 
military blocs but rather the perfection of the structures and 
mechanisms that would secure both peace and prosperity on earth. 
We have such mechanisms and structures: the United Nations, the 
CSCE, the CIS, the Arab League, the Association of States of the 
Pacific Region, the Organization of African Unity, and others. 
  In my view, one organization--the United Nations--should be 
a 
world organization and deal with general matters to ensure peace 
and stability. It is necessary to this end to perfect the 
military structure of the United Nations so that it makes 
forecasts and analyses and offers the UN Security Council some 
versions of a resolution of this problem or the other. And all 
the other regional organizations (CSCE, CIS, and others) would 
be components and structural subdivisions of the United Nations 
with their missions at the United Nations and with UN missions 
in them. They would tackle regional tasks. In place of NATO, a 
CSCE peacekeeping contingent with a change of name and, 
naturally, function would emerge. It would be involved in both 
peacekeeping and in rendering assistance at the time of a 
variety of natural disasters, accidents, and catastrophes and in 
the delivery of humanitarian aid. 
  I have been telling the top-ranking NATO people for two 
years 
now: "Following the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact, you are 
without a job, and this is why you are rushing into Yugoslavia 
or some other venture. The time has come to transform your bloc 
into a peacekeeping organization. But not on a world level, 
rather under the auspices of the CSCE." 
  I have put this idea to the leadership of Russia also. As 
yet, silence.... But unjustly so. In my view, our politicians 
should not let slip their opportunity.

<F P=106> [Article by I. Maksimychev: "A Bad Start: First Crisis in </F>
Russian-German Relations Becomes Fact"] 
  [Text] Without a doubt, the end of the Russian troop 
withdrawal from FRG territory will begin a fundamentally new 
stage in relations between Russia and Germany. It will now, 
perhaps, be justifiable to speak of the beginning of these 
relations in pure form even, without the factors attendant upon 
the presence of our soldiers in a country that never invited 
them; factors not altogether insignificant, as is sometimes 
perceived from afar. For instance, the presence of Russian 
troops in and around Berlin served for a long time as grounds 
for delaying the transfer of the government to the German 
capital. The petty thievery concentrated around Russian 
garrisons created a constant threat of provocation. Also, 
throughout the duration of the withdrawal, the temptation 
remained for certain political circles in both countries to use 
the incomplete status of the withdrawal to serve their own 
political goals. 
  From now on Russian-German relations will be built on the 
bona fide national interests of each side, without gifts or 
compensation being given for what must be done anyway. This 
sound approach will be not only for Russian-German relations. An 
approach of this kind will also be predominant in FRG's other 
lines of foreign policy with regard to the departure of other 
foreign troops from Germany. There is nothing reprehensible 
about it. Taking realities into account is entirely normal in 
the course of mutual relations between independent and sovereign 
states. Reminiscences of the age of the victors and the 
vanquished belong to the past. He who has tried to make policy 
on the basis of the latter will invariably lose. Becoming 
accustomed to the new style of conducting affairs will not be 
altogether easy. There is, however, no alternative. 
  At the same time, it would be a mistake to think that 
relations will be built in a vacuum between the new Germany and 
the new Russia. No matter how hard one tries to erase from 
history the writings of former generations, they will clearly 
surface in the texts that replace them. One cannot view 
Russian-German relations strictly from 1991 on, as many Russian 
politicians would like, or from 1945, as official Bonn does now 
with the support of the oppositional Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD]. Nor can a consideration of Russian-German 
relations begin from 1941, as is dreamed by the many with a 
phobia of Germany, or even from 1914, when an age of 
Russian-German cooperation was ended by the catastrophe of the 
First World War. 
  Unfortunately, personal, party, and pre-election interests 
frequently overshadow needs common to all of mankind, even at 
this critical juncture when the foundation for tomorrow's world 
is largely being laid. One can only regret that Russian-German 
relations are no exception in this regard. The main question, 
and not only for them -whether Russia will be a participant with 
equal rights in constructing a Greater Europe, or whether the 
West will once again try to quarantine Russia as a second-rate 
European power - is being determined on the basis of the past, 
not the future. And this is namely how Russian society is 
perceiving the now symbolic finale to the Russian troop 
withdrawal from German soil at the end of August this year, 
although the Russian side has formally assented. In the final 
analysis it is not important whether there will be a parade of 
departing troops, or whether it is held in Weimar or Berlin, or 
even whom the departing soldiers will salute on the honorary 
platform. What was and remains paramount is whether an element 
of commonality is created at the final farewell ceremony; a 
commonality that is, logically, five-fold; i.e., which includes 
both the participation of the four powers which have, for almost 
a half century, born overall responsibility for Germany, plus 
Germany, which henceforth will assume sole responsibility for 
itself. Or, will this element of commonality be absent? In other 
words, are Europeans finally ready to draw the line on the 
period of confrontation, or will they carry on the loathsome and 
fruitless bloc mind set, the tyrannical division between the 
pure and unpure, and the new, even more painful move to 
dismantle a continent? 
  The way the final farewell in Berlin is being planned for 
troops of the four powers would sooner indicate a negative 
response. The September 8, 1994 official state act at the 
Brandenburg Gates, which will finalize the withdrawal of foreign 
troops from Berlin, remains an exclusive event that will involve 
the three Western powers and Germany. In spite of all of Bonn's 
assurances of the high priority of German-Russian relations, 
Russia is being demonstrably excluded from the ranks of those 
taking part in the summit meeting. "Friends remain friends;" 
under this motto residents of the Berlin region of Shteglits 
recently bid farewell to the American battalion under their 
patronage. There is apparently a different logic regarding the 
Russians. 
  This marks the onset of a crisis in Russian-German 
relations, 
virtually even before relations have had a chance to get started 
on a new basis. The Russians' understandably wounded self-esteem 
will hardly permit them to quickly forget the completely 
undeserved disregard shown toward them. If they are being 
incriminated for the actions of the Soviet Union during the Cold 
War period, then it must not be forgotten that it was namely the 
Soviet Union's policy of Perestroika that not only created the 
necessary conditions for overcoming the division of Germany, to 
which the entire world had long become accustomed, but also 
ensured the peaceful and nonviolent reunification of Germany; 
including within the framework of the "two plus four" process. 
As far as Russia is concerned, the nation scrupulously fulfilled 
ahead of time all of its inherited obligations regarding the 
withdrawal of troops, although technically speaking, this 
operation was, on a technical, organizational and ethical level, 
one of the most complex in the history of armed forces. 
  One must point out the ineptitude demonstrated in the given 
situation by diplomatic departments in both countries in their 
failure to foresee society's reaction to the development of 
events, to obtain timely solutions to the problems which arose, 
and to avert the negative effects which could have been 
altogether avoided. On the road to the historic reconciliation 
between Russians and Germans, which Europe needs, yet another 
obstacle has arisen. One can only hope that the corresponding 
lessons will be learned from this essentially mirthless episode, 
and that both sides will realize the importance of showing 
consideration for one's partner and his sensitivities.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Voskresenskiy, deputy director of the </F>
Russia-China Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute 
of the Far East, under the rubric "Geopolitics": "A Change in 
China's Status in Russian Diplomacy"] 
  [Text] After the 
geopolitical crisis of the early 1990s, Russia changed in a 
fundamental way. Although it preserved more than four-fifths of 
the territory of the USSR, even so it has slightly more than 
half the population of the former USSR and controls no more than 
half the gross national product of the USSR in 1990. If we are 
speaking of society as a whole, Russia has certainly not 
achieved political accord yet and its strategic economic future 
is not clear yet either. The important conclusion follows from 
this that at least for a time, in terms of most parameters 
(other than the size of territory and military potential), 
Russia has moved to the category of medium-sized (regional) 
powers. 
  China is undergoing fundamental changes too. The phenomenal 
rate of development achieved in recent years is making this 
state one of the leaders in terms of overall might and prospects 
for development no longer only among the "third world" 
countries. However, China, which is now second in the world 
after the United States in terms of total production of goods 
and services (gross domestic product), continues to enjoy all 
the advantages of a "developing country." Remember that Russia 
is in 10th place for this indicator, behind not only the United 
States and China but even Japan, Germany, India, France, Italy, 
Great Britain, and Brazil. Today China is third in the world in 
terms of industrial production, behind only the United States 
and Japan, while Russia is in fifth place. It is no secret that 
today people in the PRC [People's Republic of China] are 
extremely disturbed by the changes in the geopolitical situation 
along the perimeter of China's borders and the especially 
destabilizing influence on Chinese society of sociopolitical 
processes in the CIS republics, which theoretically might bring 
to China processes similar to those which caused the dissolution 
of the USSR, given the separatist trends in Tibet, Xinjiang, and 
Guangdong. Despite the obvious success of the reforms, there 
are difficulties of a political and economic nature in China 
just as in Russia, and the future appearance of this country is 
not perfectly clear, which obviously worries not only its 
closest neighbors. 
  Russia is a Eurasian power, and its interests in connection 
with this are objectively grouped in both the West and the East. 
Russia's role in Asia is gradually beginning to change. The 
country's national interests were wrongly assessed by USSR 
foreign policy strategists. The struggle against imperialism and 
then against the PRC for a long time had a prominent place in 
our country's foreign policy course in Asia, while other 
countries for the most part concentrated on maintaining or 
achieving the needed growth in labor productivity per capita, 
which should finally be regarded of paramount importance in 
Russia's strategy. But at the same time Russia must now also 
decide which components of its national interests are to be 
realized and in what direction. And the approach to this 
question should be as pragmatic as possible. That does not mean 
Russia's assuming a one-sided orientation to the West or to the 
East, which still occurs depending on the domestic policy 
situation in the country, but rather it means achieving a 
consensus among the political elite in terms of what direction 
the "strategic partnership" needed for peaceful existence and to 
attract new technologies and investments to modernize the 
economy should take; and where we can find mutually advantageous 
cooperation in relations and the balance of economic interests 
needed for Russia's geopolitical stability. 
  It is perfectly clear that today large-scale investments and 
new technologies can only come to Russia from the West; that is 
the objective reality. Regardless of our likes and dislikes, the 
United States' role here is a crucial one in all senses. That is 
why access to U.S. markets is so important to Russia. True, 
behind the talk of a "strategic partnership" of democratic 
Russia with the United States, we somehow do not hear of 
successes of Russian diplomacy in achieving most-favored nation 
status in trade with this country, while communist China easily 
extends this status from year to year. At the same time, 
however, China is not only our largest Asian neighbor with a 
dynamic rate of development (the ratio of the yearly volume of 
production of GNP between Russia and China dropped from 2:1 in 
1990 to 1.25:1 in 1992 and may change to 0.75:1 by the year 
2000) and a population of almost 1.5 billion people opposite the 
sparsely populated territories of Siberia and the Far East. It 
is now the second most important trade partner with the Russian 
Federation after the FRG. The PRC is apparently the only country 
upon which Russia can realistically depend in strengthening its 
positions in northern Asia, this most dynamically developing 
region of the world. The extraordinary importance of a Chinese 
orientation for Russian foreign policy stems from that. Indeed, 
neither the United States nor especially Japan is inclined to 
automatically help raise Russia's role in the Asian-Pacific 
Ocean region, since this would objectively result in their 
narrowed influence in the system of foreign policy and economic 
ties which have already become established. For this reason, the 
hopes of certain analysts that the resolution of the territorial 
question with Japan will open an era of large-scale cooperation 
with this country are very problematical. But for China 
cooperation with Russia may to a significant degree act as a 
factor for maintaining the balance of forces in northern Asia in 
counterbalance to the one-sided rise in influence of the United 
States and Japan, which is not to China's advantage. And 
although on the strategic level China may consider Russia a 
source of instability, at the same time there is no doubt that a 
threat to China from the north disappeared along with the 
disintegration of the USSR. 
  Russia's entry into the Asian economic space is 
predetermined 
by the fact that the USSR, whose successor Russia is, in the 
past built up only its military-political presence and in 
practice did not participate in the process of forming the 
structure of regional economic cooperation. After the USSR's 
disappearance from the international arena and in light of the 
economic difficulties, Russia's future presence in the region 
depends only on its ability to incorporate itself into the 
process of economic integration. In present conditions Russia 
will not be able to decide any issue by military means. It is 
obvious that the situation that has now taken shape is 
characterized by Russia's low level of realization of its 
interests in Asia, which is linked above all to the lack of a 
clearcut strategic course of development of the country. 
  At the same time, however, Russia's transfer of focus from 
the military-political sphere to the area of economic contacts, 
that is to say the change in status from a military superpower 
to the status of an economic partner, is undoubtedly in China's 
interests. China is interested in multipolarization of the 
economic structure in the region to counterbalance the one-sided 
rise in Japan's role in order to prevent China from experiencing 
a growing relative economic lag. Fairly strong economic ties of 
the northern and northwestern provinces of the PRC with the 
Russian Far East and its Central Asian part would also be in the 
PRC's interests in order to prevent the growing imbalance in the 
economic development of the country's north and south, which is 
fraught with the potential danger of increased separatist 
tendencies within the Chinese state. 
  For Russia friendly relations with China guarantee a 
reliable 
rear area for relations with the West, no matter what these 
relations are in the future, in exactly the same way that Russia 
provides this rear area for China. As its positions in the world 
are reinforced, the new Russia could help raise China's role on 
the world level just as China could provide support to Russia on 
the regional level, and accordingly both countries could 
continue to progress along the path of reform and structural 
reorganization of their economies. 
  However, we must not shut our eyes to the fact that a 
breeding ground for rivalry between Russia and China within the 
framework of the international system of relations continues to 
exist. Today it is defined not only by traditional geopolitical 
considerations as in the past, but also by the following two 
features. First, both Russia and China now occupy a similar 
position in the world system of relations, that is to say, in 
the eyes of the world they are major regional powers which are 
either on the threshold or in the process of transforming their 
political systems and reforming their economies, that is to say, 
essentially they are developing countries called upon in 
principle to play a world role based on their objective 
conditions. Moreover, the medium for rivalry is determined by 
the differences in the initial parameters, general strategy, and 
context of socioeconomic transformations in these countries. 
Without dwelling on comparing the Chinese and Russian reforms, 
one can assert that in terms of such criteria as the state's 
economic role and the correlation of forms of ownership, the 
interdependence of transformations in economics and politics, 
and others, they are developing in different ways. Thus, the 
degree of Russia and China's compatibility with international 
economic structures and the degree to which the countries fit 
into the world economy differ. On the other hand, the Russian 
domestic policy situation determines the complexities of 
economic interaction at the given stage, in particular the 
clearly unequal character of trade between our countries. 
  The similarity of the tasks which our countries are 
performing and at the same time the differences in the nature of 
the reforms and their rates allow Russia and China in the very 
near future and with definite focused efforts to occupy 
different niches in the world division of labor and in 
attracting international investments; that is to say to avoid a 
direct collision of interests, which when the complementary 
nature of the economies is taken into account may ensure 
perfectly harmonious development of both interstate relations 
and economic ties. The main components of the national interests 
of Russia and China are by no means mutually exclusive in 
principle. Although periods of acute confrontation between our 
countries were observed more than once throughout the 400 years 
of history of interrelations, this was above all the result of 
major foreign policy miscalculations or considerations of an 
ideological nature. So the difficulties which exist in relations 
are certainly surmountable today, and both countries may at 
least in the short-term utilize one another's potential to 
modernize and reform their own economies.

"Chinese Bankers in Moscow Want To Influence Trade"] 
  [Text] The Bank of China in Moscow (Elos) is a joint-stock 
commercial bank. It was founded by three financial institutions. 
The Bank of China is the principal shareholder. Along with it, 
blocs of second-rate shares are held by the most significant 
members of the Bank of China group in Hong Kong and 
Macau--Jincheng and Xinhua. The Bank of China owns 100 percent 
of the stock of the latter banks; therefore, it is possible to 
assert that the Moscow institution is a subsidiary bank of the 
Bank of China in Russia. 
  The statutory capital of Elos comes to $10 million. Mr. Du 
Wan You, vice president of the Bank of China in Moscow, observed 
self-critically that "by Russian standards, we are a small 
bank." However, the potential of the Chinese institution in 
Russia hinges on two factors. 
  Direct relations with the Bank of China are the first 
factor. 
The bank was founded at the beginning of this century. Although 
it remained in quite a lamentable condition until the end of the 
1970's, by the end of 1992 the Bank of China came to rank 19th 
in the world. The Bank of China has 448 foreign branches in the 
main financial centers of the world with a staff of more than 
16,000. Correspondent relations have been established with more 
than 4,000 banks in 150 countries of the world. A few hundred 
banks maintain relationships with the Bank of China on the basis 
of the continuous mutual transfers of funds. 
  The Bank of China in Moscow operates in close contact with 
the head office, amounting in fact to its branch in Russia. This 
makes it possible for Mr. Du Wan You to say that his bank would 
transfer monetary funds to any point in the world within one to 
three days, depending on the time zone. 
  Active commercial relations between the two countries are 
the 
second factor strengthening the position of the Bank of China in 
Russia. Suffice it to say, the Bank of China (Elos) is the only 
Chinese financial institution in Russia. Out of a multitude of 
Russian banks, only the Foreign Trade Bank operates in China at 
present. The Bank of China is owned by the state. For this 
reason, it now operates within the framework of Beijing's 
official policy, which is geared toward expanding the trade in 
Chinese products in Russia in every way possible. 
  Mr. Du Wan You stressed: "As a bank, we must generate 
profits. However, our main objective is to solve the problem of 
bilateral settlements and facilitate economic cooperation." This 
is understood full well in the Russian power structure, which 
explains the ease with which the Bank of China obtained all the 
necessary licenses in April of last year." [quotation marks as 
published] 
  Chinese companies and trading firms have become the main 
clients of the Bank of China in Moscow. Elos has already begun 
extending credit to Chinese legal entities. At present, the 
Central Bank of Russia is considering the issue of performing 
ruble-to-yuan conversion operations. There are virtually no 
Russian firms among the clients of the Bank of China. 
  At present, Elos accepts deposits in U.S. dollars and 
effects 
currency transfers and exchange. A special subdivision exists 
that provides consulting services aimed at finding partners in 
the Chinese and Russian markets. In the long term, the Bank of 
China intends to embark on investment, fiduciary, and leasing 
operations, as well as operations with securities. 
  As of now, the Bank of China has established correspondent 
relations with two dozen Russian banks. Mr. Du Wan You noted the 
quite warm attitude toward the Chinese bank on the part of 
Russian commercial banks. In his opinion, market adaptation is 
proceeding quite successfully. 
  Thirty people work for the Bank of China in Moscow, of whom 
only 10 are Russians. This circumstance, which is rare in 
foreign banks, explains a certain delay in the development of 
services. The management of the bank continuously notes that at 
present its employees are mainly getting used to the Russian 
market and studying it. In particular, a lack of knowledge of 
the situation hinders the beginning of credit extension to 
Russian firms. 
  For the time being, the Bank of China is not planning to 
open 
branches in other cities of Russia for the same reason. In 
principle, it is necessary to open branches in St. Petersburg 
and the Far East. However, this is not expected in the 
foreseeable future. At present, the Bank of China has a 
representative office in Kazakhstan.

"Foreign Banks No Longer Attract Close Attention"] 
  [Text] Fundamental restrictions imposed on the 
development of foreign banks in Russia by the Central Bank are 
much more significant than restrictions on operations with 
rubles that have been set forth in a presidential edict. 
  Questions about the attitude of the domestic business 
community toward the presence of foreign banks in Russia come up 
at virtually all meetings between bankers and journalists. 
However, it is now becoming absolutely clear that this question 
is no longer topical. Nobody recalls any longer the norm of 12 
percent of the combined capital of commercial banks to which 
foreign banking capital is restricted. Meanwhile, it is 
precisely this norm that currently determines the market share 
of banking institutions with foreign capital. 
  The combined statutory capital of foreign banks is about 
$100 
million. Meanwhile, the Inkombank alone will increase its 
statutory capital from $50 million to $100 million during 1994. 
The Yugorskiy Bank is placing the third issue of shares and 
counting on an increase in its statutory capital to R50 billion. 
According to the latest rating, the Inkombank ranks eighth, and 
the Yugorskiy Bank, 25th. 
  The might of a Russian bank no longer hinges solely on a 
broadly advertised name and a rapidly developing chain of 
branches, but also on the division of the client market. Large 
clients and special exporters who are welcome guests at all 
banks have long opted for their domestic banking institutions. 
Large clients frequently purchase the stock of banks in which 
their accounts are open, which results in additional advantages 
for these enterprises. Russian banks that have attracted these 
clients provide the greatest possible range of services; they 
have grown to be large financial institutions by European 
standards. The final partition of the market of large clients is 
also confirmed by the fact that large banks are now fighting for 
clients who are private individuals. It is quite symbolic that 
the Yugorskiy Bank, which has been nurtured by the domestic 
exporters of oil and refinery products, rapidly implemented the 
restructuring of the bank and, effective 16 May, began to work 
with private individuals. 
  At the beginning of 1994, the MMB [Moscow International 
Bank], the oldest foreign bank in Russia, revised its market 
strategy. The bank shifted from international currency 
settlements and the distribution of the credit lines of 
international financial institutions to full-fledged services to 
Russian and Western enterprises, also developing debit 
operations. As a matter of fact, the MMB, which was founded in 
1989, joined the competitive struggle as late as four years 
later. 
  Even now, new banks are not under any illusion as far as 
attracting currency clients is concerned. They bet on 
sufficiently large and medium-size Russian enterprises and 
organizations. The effectiveness of settlements, the accrual of 
interest on accounts, and opportunities for taking out credit 
and performing fiduciary operations are becoming the main 
points. The banks are vigorously developing stock market 
instruments--bills of exchange and deposit certificates, which 
ensure tax relief for their clients. 
  Therefore, the development of a customer base is becoming a 
great problem for foreign banks. This base is turning out to be 
quite narrow in Russia because foreign banks go after large 
commercial and industrial customers. The offices of foreign 
banks do not allow them to establish services for nonresident 
private individuals who might prefer a domestic bank over a 
local bank [as published]. 
  Foreign banks must obtain a license for each new branch. For 
this reason, they are now based in Moscow and St. Petersburg 
where the market is the most saturated. A branch of the Austria 
Bank sometimes acts as a clearing bank of sorts, an intermediary 
between regional credit institutions. However, this can hardly 
be called the rule. Interregional and interrepublic settlements 
through foreign banks are difficult. This factor also reduces 
the attractiveness of Western banks on the Russian market. 
  Fundamental restrictions imposed on the development of 
foreign banks in Russia by the Central Bank are much more 
significant than restrictions on operations with rubles, which 
have been set forth in a presidential edict. This is all the 
more so because, with a tacit approval from Neglinnaya Street, 
foreign banks have embarked on operations with Russian currency 
quietly and in a planned manner. The Central Bank came out 
against the presidential restrictions right away. In turn, the 
presidential edict does not provide for sanctions against 
violators. The developed draft Law on the Bank of Russia and the 
draft Law on Banks and Banking envision that, in the future, the 
Central Bank will continue to regulate the operation of joint 
and foreign banks and their branches in the Russian territory.

"Warsaw: The G7-E10 Game Continued"; first paragraph is 
introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] A total of 200 billion dollars in foreign investment 
and 70 percent of GNP created by the private sector -- these are 
the goals for the post-socialist countries by the year 2000. 
  G-7: Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the USA, France 
and Japan. 
  E-10: Belarus, Bulgaria, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Poland, 
Russia, 
Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and the Czech Republic. 
  The third "East-West" Conference of Ministers of Economics, 
Industry and Trade of the G-7 countries and of the ten reforming 
countries was recently held in the Polish capital. 
  The "East-West" conferences (the two preceding ones were 
held 
in Germany and Japan) dealt with not only the forms of 
cooperation between the G-7 countries and the reforming ones, 
but also areas of possible technical assistance which can bring 
early returns and promote market relations and democratization 
in the former Eastern Bloc countries in the best way possible. 
  A feature of the Third Conference is the "East-West" 
business 
forum that preceded it which furnished a reply to the intentions 
voiced earlier of drawing the business community into the 
discussion of possibilities and conditions for accelerating 
reform in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the 
former Soviet Union. 
  The direct participation of about 200 businessmen in the 
transformation process imparted a dynamic and genuine character 
to the meeting. Their proposals and recommendations for the 
governments of the 17 countries spelled out in the Warsaw 
Declaration were presented to the Ministers and discussed at 
round-table sessions. 
  Those present acknowledged the following as the three 
pillars 
of partnership between the advanced countries and the reforming 
countries: an effective private economy, foreign investment and 
international trade. Hence the goals of the ten countries are 
these: 200 billion dollars in direct foreign investment, 70 
percent of GNP produced by the private sector, and 17 percent of 
trade should be conducted with countries of the G-7 (currently 
this figure stands at 6-7 percent). 
  As was stressed at the conference, the countries which 
belong 
to the so-called E-10 Group are currently experiencing a 
difficult transition to a market economy. Apart from the 
variations in their economic development, there are certain 
problems they all share. First of all, there has been a marked 
decrease in GNP caused by a slump in industrial production 
accompanied by high inflation and unemployment rates. There has 
also been a plunge in trade between the former CMEA countries. 
  But the first positive effects of the economic changes are 
appearing. Some countries have registered a significant GNP 
increase, and others have registered a slowing in the 
downward-trend. This tendency has been due to increases in 
output: in Poland -- by 6.2 percent and in Hungary -- by 4.3 
percent. The first results of privatization have also been 
appearing. According to estimates, in Poland, the Czech 
Republic, and Hungary, toward the end of this year fifty percent 
of their GNP will be created by the private sector. 
  Everyone agreed that for the economic reforms in the E-10 
countries to be successful, there needs to be considerable 
activity by foreign investors. Benefits from their investments 
are many and diverse: they spur production growth and job 
creation, they pay taxes which add to the budget, and they 
introduce state-of-the-art technologies and modern-day 
managerial techniques. Foreign capital in Eastern Europe since 
1989 has totaled more than 20 billion dollars. The biggest share 
has been invested in Hungary (5.6 billion US$), then Poland (3.0 
billion US$), followed by the Czech Republic (2.16 billion US$). 
At the same time, the value of foreign capital in international 
investment markets totalled 200 billion dollars last year. Of 
that sum, South American and Asian countries succeeded in 
attracting 56 billion dollars. In China, for example, foreign 
investment totaled 26 billion dollars. 
  The capacious market of "the Ten" will remain attractive for 
foreign investors. In the view of many participants in the 
Warsaw meeting, there are vast investment opportunities in the 
Russian and Kazakh fuel industries, the Ukrainian agriculture 
sector, the region's transportation, water-management and 
energy-producing infrastructure, as well as in the development 
of the banking and telecommunications sector. 
  The G-7, voicing its readiness to invest before the year 
2000 
a total of 200 billion dollars in the post-socialist countries, 
is nonetheless setting its own stipulations. They concern 
explicit investment conditions, especially a plain and 
unequivocal tax system, as well as customs privileges, 
possibilities for profit repatriation, patent protection, 
privatization, and how jurisdiction is divided between the 
central government and the local authorities. 
  As to the latter, businessmen recounted quite a few 
impressions of their association with bureaucrats of every 
stripe who seemed to be deliberately created to prevent the 
formation of a market. "Businessmen will invest their money 
provided it can make a profit." A British entrepreneur was 
hammering this idea and his colleagues were nodding with 
approval. 
  The conferees in Warsaw continued their essential 
conversation about a model program for restructuring industrial 
enterprises. The basic concept of the program drafted by a group 
of Japanese specialists envisages the development and 
implementation of pilot projects, under a Western technical aid 
scheme, to restructure the basic enterprises in different 
industrial sectors of the countries undergoing reform. This goal 
is to introduce into these firms effective management techniques 
and to expedite their privatization. 
  So far only Japan has taken real steps in this direction. 
Japan's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Industry has enlisted the 
services of the "Nomura" private research institute and the 
"Rotobo" association and has drawn upon funds earmarked by the 
Japanese government, with aid and assistance from the Russian 
State Committee for Industrial Policy. This group has formulated 
a project for restructuring the Murom engineering plant and has 
started similar work on the Smolensk garment-making association 
called "Charm." Japanese Minister Eijiro Hata informed the 
Warsaw conferees about a series of seminars being prepared to 
discuss Japanese experience in the field of industrial policy, 
to be held in Poland and Russia later this year. 
  "The "East-West" conference is truly unique because it 
realizes two fundamental ideas," First Deputy Economics Minister 
of the RF Andrei Shapovalyants told this correspondent. "One of 
them is that now, on the geopolitical plane, an economic 
mechanism is being created for cooperation among all countries 
in conditions of reform of the post-communist countries, and 
this raises the question: in what form can the Western countries 
help those being reformed precisely in the way of developing 
market relations and building a civilized economic mechanism 
which should perhaps take shape towards the close of the year 
2000 in all countries constituting "the Ten." The other idea is 
to see how direct investment, forms of technical aid, and 
organization of aid in privatization and in solving the 
questions having to do with liberalization, work directly for 
the entrepreneur. So, it is important that not only officials 
but also representatives of the business world have come 
together here. [quotation marks as published] 
  How do you view the sum of 200 billion dollars as 
investment for "the Ten" with respect to the Russian 
economy? 
  I would not view this figure as a binding plan which we have 
to implement. It is meant as an estimate of possibilities 
afforded by the E-10 investment market so as to be able to 
implement effective projects which would attract the interest of 
foreign investments. That the requirements of every country 
exceed manifold this sum is crystal-clear. To distribute the sum 
in anticipation of which country will implement a highly 
effective project is not essential yet. What is meant is a total 
estimate of projects that can be "mastered" by Western investors. 
  And do you believe that 70 percent of Russia's gross 
national product will be created by the private sector by the 
year 2000? 
  A program for post-voucher privatization to enter into force 
after July 1, 1994 is in the works. Under that program, 
depending on the chosen scheme, it will take the shape of either 
investment trading or portfolio investments, and maybe it can 
place heavy emphasis on foreign investment, drawing foreigners 
into the sphere of privatization. Which regime will be decided 
upon will determine whether the private sector will account for 
70, 62 or 54 percent of the economy. I would not regard this as 
a binding plan. Together with the 200 billion dollar sum we have 
interlinked estimates whose accuracy still needs to be verified. 
That is to say, for each of the countries it would be essential 
to make an elementary survey as to what foreign investments will 
do to increase the proportion of private capital within the 
economy. I for one am confident that in Russia, for instance, 
the growth in the share of private capital will be due not to 
foreign investment but to the development of inner processes of 
privatization.

<F P=106> [Article by G. Rivkin (jointly with Multinational </F>
Strategies, Inc. --experts on state risk in Central and East 
European Countries): "There Is a Need To Have a Will and a Way 
To Pay Debts"; first paragraph is introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] The credits issued by foreign banks to 
Vnesheconombank (Foreign Economic Bank) have lost 50% of 
their 
value since early December. Western investors discuss further 
prospects with enhanced interest. 
  A government's ability to pay debts is determined by two 
fundamental reasons: the possibility to pay and a desire to pay. 
  At present, the Russian government's ability to pay debts on 
time has lowered due to the costly attempts to keep the ruble 
rate from sharply falling. It was estimated that in the most 
turbulent week of January these attempts cost the government 
approximately from one to 1.4 billion. The inflationary 
consequences of economic policy will adversely affect subsequent 
economic development and add to the already powerful leakage of 
capitals. 
  This will slow down the growth of new resources and be 
instrumental in the further depletion of the existing ones, 
whereas all this taken together will tell on solvency in respect 
to credits. 
  These negative economic trends will force Russia to seek 
external sources of financing, such as from the IMF. 
  It has to be admitted that the Russian government's desire 
to 
pay debts has likewise been lowered. 
  It looks as if those who form Russia's policy are not at all 
worried over the menacing prospect that access to credit markets 
could be closed in the event of failure to pay the debt. The 
West has little faith in financial threats and promises. 
  And, lastly, in keeping with the Constitution of Russia and 
with Yeltsin's Decree of November 1993, parliament alone can 
determine the size of foreign loans and draw up the federal 
budget. However, considering the character of the new parliament 
and its literal understanding of the Constitution, the 
government will have to carefully analyze and weigh up which 
conditions of paying the debt parliament will see as acceptable. 
  The aforesaid makes it possible to understand why the price 
of Russia's debt has been lowered. However, an agreement with 
the IMF on the deferral of payment could overturn this entire 
scenario and enable Russia to somewhat brace itself before 
beginning to pay the debt. 
  The importance of this agreement is evidenced by the fact 
that in the draft of the 1994 Russian budget the sum earmarked 
for the payment of the debt (6.4 billion dollars) roughly equals 
the sum of the new offered foreign credits. (2.5 billion are 
expected to be borrowed from international financial 
organizations.) How real the prospect of reaching an agreement 
is depends on Russia's specific policy. The IMF would like to 
conclude such an agreement, but as we all know, a tango needs 
two. 
<H5>  Russia's Different Liabilities for Its Debts </H5>
<H5>  Eurobonds of Vnesheconombank </H5>
  These bonds have three positive characteristics meriting 
attention. First, since the moment of their emission in 
1988-1990 there has not been a case of non-payment on these 
bonds. Second, non-payment on international bonds always has 
greater significance (price) than the non-payment of commercial 
bank credits on international markets. This is explained by the 
fact that the international markets of securities are more 
effective, and therefore a bad reputation on these markets is 
particularly undesirable. Third, payments on these bonds were 
relatively small in 1994. The full package of these shares gives 
an interest to approximately the sum of 115 million. 
<H5>  Finance Ministry's Dollar Bonds </H5>
  The principal drawback of these bonds stems from the fact 
that the Russian government is the heir to the former Soviet 
government with its traditional non-payments on internal state 
bonds. And the political culture, enabling the government to 
handle its people in this way, is being changed at a very slow 
pace. Not long ago the Russian authorities again demonstrated 
their scorn for their citizens' financial interests when they 
withdrew from turnover the rubles emitted prior to 1993 -- this 
campaign was poorly prepared and organized. 
  In this way, the drawbacks of the financial policy have the 
effect that at the given moment all hopes in connection with 
paying the debt are pinned on foreign credits. 
  In a crisis-like situation it is logical to use these 
credits 
primarily for the purpose of keeping communication lines open 
and honoring international debt liabilities to the detriment of 
innerstate ones. (The total sum needed for the repayment of 
domestic bonds in 1994 comes to roughly 500 million dollars.) 
One more negative moment consists in the relative non-liquidity 
of these bonds in comparison with Eurobonds. The longer terms of 
payment (repayment) on these bonds do not permit them to be 
quoted at foreign banks. 
<H5>  Vnesheconombank's Debts to Foreign Commercial Banks </H5>
  The total sum of this debt (on which interest is accrued) is 
roughly 20 billion dollars, which is roughly four billion more 
than the fixed interest on payment. Of the three main types of 
debt liabilities this debt is the most susceptible to both 
positive and negative factors. Therefore it is more liable to 
fluctuations in the rate of prices. This debt is the biggest and 
most liquid of the three. The positive moment consists in the 
fact that, to all appearances, the Russians have continued 
acting in accordance with the terms of the agreement reached 
last summer on payments for 1993 -- in keeping with which Russia 
must pay the incomplete interests on 500 million in exchange for 
a deferral of the payment for five-ten years. This is attested 
by the sum earmarked in the draft budget for the payment of the 
debt. The negative moment, however, is that a concrete debtor 
was discussed at the talks and the question is in whether it is 
possible to present a suit to the Russian state in the event of 
non-payment. 
  Any steps in the direction of fulfilling the reached 
agreement are important to keep the price of the debt (the rate 
of prices) alive. Whether it will be possible to reach such an 
agreement relative to payment in 1994 and further on depends on 
the general international situation. 
  A worsening of Russia's economic position adds to its 
dependence on foreign creditors. There is also a need to note 
the circumstance that the fright triggered by the elections and 
the subsequent development of events has led to greater 
pliability on the part of commercial banks -- they have shown a 
leniency to negotiate even on terms offered by Russia. One 
analyst has surmised that the banks may even go to the length of 
forgiving debts, although nothing has yet been said about this 
anywhere. 
<H5>  Forecast </H5>
  Considering the present-day trends, it is safe to surmise 
most likely that in the next six months the Russian government 
will continue claiming that it remains true to the policy of 
reforms. Though in view of this it will continue printing money 
and not permit itself to take care of inflationary consequences. 
  Such actions will soon lead to a growth of inflation, a fall 
in the ruble rate and a general deterioration of the economic 
situation. 
  It is not ruled out that by the summer the worsening of the 
economic situation will lead to a search for new ways of 
economic development and a resurgence of the dispute between 
reformers and conservatives. And in the second half of the year 
the results of this dispute will tell on the price (rate) of 
Russia's debt. 
  Another major moment, which may subsequently influence the 
prices of the debt, is the outcome of elections in Germany. 
Chancellor Kohl is directly linked to the moral and financial 
support being rendered to Russia by German banks. 
  The large-scale character of this aid places the German 
banks 
in opposition to the likely variant of the Brady plan which, 
among other things, implies forgiving the debt should this 
question arise at the talks. 
  The new government will not consider itself to be bound by 
liabilities on extended credits and therefore (although every 
possible kind of financial considerations may also exist on this 
score) it may fully support the Brady plan. It is important to 
stress, however, that the mere fact of Kohl's defeat at the 
coming elections alone will not lead to a rise in prices -- the 
new government will have to announce its concrete policy on this 
question. It is also important that as of today the Brady plan 
does not figure in any talks on debts.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Chernakov under the rubric "Timber": </F>
"Need and Insects Compelled Americans To Turn to Russia"] 
  [Text] "And I whacked him for all I was worth so that my 
arm went limp--here is one for you for Vietnam, for Hiroshima, 
and for that beetle of theirs!..." (From a Russian song) 
  For the first time Russian loggers will be able to break 
into 
the American market, which has so far been geared toward its own 
resources and deliveries from neighboring Canada. For the first 
time Russian timber-processing enterprises and pulp-and-paper 
combines will be able to obtain up-to-date technologies and 
equipment from a credit line guaranteed by the U.S. Government. 
Finally, for the first time in Russian-American relations it has 
become possible to seriously discuss a project of such 
significance at the highest level. The document whose signing 
means the implementation of all these "first times" in practice 
is called the Agreement on Cooperation in the Area of 
Modernizing the Timber Industry Complex of Russia. It is planned 
to review the draft agreement in June among other documents at a 
regular meeting of the intergovernmental commission for issues 
of Russian-American scientific-technical and economic 
cooperation (the "Chernomyrdin-Gore Commission"). 
  The Russian logging company Roslesprom is currently awaiting 
the remarks and comments of the U.S. Department of Commerce 
concerning the draft agreement on the reconstruction and 
upgrading of the pulp-and-paper and timber-processing industry 
of Russia and the delivery of Russian products to the American 
market. Upon coordination, it is planned that the draft 
agreement will be reviewed within a general package of documents 
submitted for the June meeting of the "Chernomyrdin-Gore 
Commission." 
  As a KOMMERSANT correspondent has managed to learn, a credit 
line guaranteed by the U.S. Government and the participation of 
American companies producing equipment for the pulp-and-paper 
and timber-processing industry in modernizing a number of key 
Russian enterprises in the industry will be the main aspects of 
the agreement for the Russian side. (As chief specialist of 
Roslesprom Aleksandr Lagutenkov told a KOMMERSANT correspondent, 
the depreciation of fixed assets at a number of combines and 
associations has now reached 60-70 percent.) 
  The Russians will pay back the credit with finished 
products. 
Domestic loggers will thus be given an opportunity for the first 
time to enter the U.S. market, which has so far been geared 
mainly toward its own resources and deliveries from Canada. 
  Judging by unofficial information from Roslesprom, the 
Americans are mainly interested in pulp-and-paper production 
facilities. At present Roslesprom is working on a list of 
enterprises which, in the opinion of the Russian side, may 
attract American partners. These are primarily combines 
outfitted with new equipment which are capable of substantially 
increasing the output of exportable products. According to 
information which KOMMERSANT has succeeded in obtaining at 
Roslesprom, this list will certainly include the joint-stock 
company Arkhangelsk Pulp-and-Paper Combine, Svyatogorsk 
(Leningrad Oblast), Solikamskbumprom (Perm Oblast), and the 
Tsepruss Joint Venture (the former Kaliningrad Pulp-and-Paper 
Plant). 
  Strange as it may be, the project was initiated by the 
Americans themselves rather than the Russian loggers, who are 
smothered by domestic problems and depressed by a slump in the 
world market. As a KOMMERSANT correspondent was told at 
Roslesprom, two main reasons compelled American consumers to 
establish contacts with Russia. The appearance in 1993 of a 
certain beetle in the Canadian forests which turns quality 
timber into dust was the first reason. American consumers have 
tightened the quality requirements for products delivered from 
the north, and Canadians had to treat the forest intensively in 
order to destroy the beetle. So far, the insecticidal campaign 
has not been particularly successful. Meanwhile, the scope of 
activities of the malevolent insect has become so extensive that 
the United States, where about 300 kilograms of paper products 
per capita are produced annually, had to turn its sights toward 
Russia, where as little as 28 kilograms of such products are 
produced. 
  The "Greens" movement, under pressure from which draft laws 
sharply restricting the cutting of forests have been recently 
passed in both North American states, is the second cause which 
prompted the Americans to offer cooperation to Russia. It is 
notable that Vice President Albert Gore is one of the champions 
of this strategic policy in the United States; in June he will 
meet with Prime Minister of Russia Viktor Chernomyrdin in order 
to discuss, among others, issues of delivering the products of 
Russian loggers to the United States.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Pichugin, with commentary by the </F>
International Life Department, under the rubric "The Steepler 
Company Is Automating the Duma": "Deputies Have Each Received an 
Automated Work Station"] 
  [Text] As soon as the State Duma of the Russian 
Federation made a determination as to its location, the 
management of its staff began to urgently resolve the issue of 
automating the activities of deputies. On 4 May, Chief of the 
State Duma Staff Andrey Voykov and General Director of the 
Steepler Company Maksim Selivanov signed a general agreement on 
the creation of the Duma Data and Communications Complex (IKK). 
The first stage of the effort ended as early as today: The 
computer network has been installed, tested, and started up; 
Steepler has embarked on user training, and the deputies have 
begun to test the complex at work and submit individual wishes. 
According to a business plan submitted by Steepler, the 
tentative cost of the complex comes to $30 million. 
  No official competition or tender to automate the State Duma 
was held. At any rate, in the words of company president Andrey 
Cheglakov, Steepler has not happened to encounter competition, 
even if the Duma staff considered alternative variants. Mr. 
Cheglakov believes that there was simply no time to hold a 
tender in keeping with all the rules. Indeed, 100 days have 
already passed since the Duma began its work, but its location 
was not finally determined until the end of April. As soon as 
the specific floor space became known after the move into the 
building of the former State Planning Committee, Mr. Voykov, who 
has great experience with automation, made his choice. 
  An extremely tight schedule for making deliveries and 
performing work was one of the conditions of the project. 
Steepler has accumulated great experience in the area of 
comprehensive automation of enterprises (its customers include 
the Staff of the President of Russia, the Bank for Foreign 
Trade, and Surgutneftegaz). Steepler has included in its staff 
specialists who at one time took part in the computerization of 
the CPSU Central Committee, the Staff of the USSR President, the 
USSR Supreme Soviet, and other structures. Incidentally, the 
perestroyka history of automation of deputy work began with an 
order from Anatoliy Lukyanov. The Supreme Soviet he headed was 
equipped with Macintosh computers made by the Apple company with 
specially designed automated work stations for deputies. The 
fate of this complex is traceable up to the October events of 
last year in the White House, and thereafter the trace is lost. 
In view of the fact that Steepler has the status of wholesaler 
(large wholesale supplier) of the Hewlett Packard company, the 
current IKK of the Duma has been designed on the basis of 
network equipment, computers, and peripherals of this American 
company. A dozen Epson dot matrix printers and Panasonic 
communications and office equipment account for an insignificant 
proportion of the total volume of equipment. 
  Each Duma deputy will receive a work station worth 
$15,000-20,000. It will be possible to quickly dismantle the 
entire complex and move it to another building: The Duma is 
making provisions for the event of moving yet again. Mr. 
Cheglakov views the assignment of the Duma automation order 
specifically to a Russian company also as a manifestation of 
protectionism: This is an effective way for the state to support 
Russian business. Perhaps counting on the continuation of such 
practices, Steepler, which used to bet on developing a 
dealership chain, has changed priorities in its operations 
somewhat. At present the company gives preference to the 
implementation of large projects involving the comprehensive 
automation of enterprises.

<H5>  Commentary </H5>
  The world understood long ago that legislative authorities 
wishing to work efficiently must be computerized. The case of 
the U.S. Congress is perhaps the most impressive. The 
computerization of the Congress began as early as 1974. Annually 
no less than $1 billion is appropriated to maintain a colossal 
data and computer network. The House of Representatives and the 
Senate have their own networks; not only each legislator but 
also his aides have computerized work stations. However, giving 
everyone a computer is just the beginning. 
  The effectiveness of operation of a network depends on its 
interaction with nationwide databases. The computer networks of 
the U.S. Congress have access to all databases of the country 
(there are about 10 that are the most important), and have an 
opportunity to retrieve any data, from a quote from a provincial 
newspaper on any topic to data about world industrial output 
broken down by sector. There also is a database of the Congress 
itself drawing on the Library of Congress. At present, the 
transfer of its records to laser disks is being completed. 
  As a result, the staff of the U.S. Congress is capable of 
not 
only criticizing or knowledgeably supporting the draft laws of 
the administration, but also of developing in detail a 
full-fledged alternative draft budget (this means thousands of 
pages of text). In general, computerization is a good foundation 
for legislative fertility: During one session the U.S. Congress 
passes more than 20,000 laws, and is in a position to monitor 
the execution of any one of them.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Varnavskaya under the rubric "Taxation </F>
of Receipts of Foreigners": "Russians Must Pay for Their Foreign 
Partners"] 
  [Text] The State Tax Service has clarified the 
question of which particular receipts of foreign legal entities 
generated by them on the territory of Russia Russian companies 
must pay taxes on. A letter of the tax department, the official 
distribution of which began yesterday, contains a quite detailed 
and specific listing of such receipts of foreign companies taxed 
"at the source of payment." The new document has considerably 
expanded the list of taxable receipts which, in the opinion of 
KOMMERSANT experts, may be viewed as a harsher tax regimen. 
  In keeping with existing taxation procedures, only 
foreign companies operating on the territory of Russia through 
permanent representative offices pay taxes on profits through 
general procedures. Taxes on foreign legal entities which do not 
have permanent representative offices in Russia but generate 
receipts on its territory are levied in a special way--at the 
source of payment. This tax is withheld by the enterprise that 
pays receipts to a foreign legal entity in the currency in which 
the payment is made, from the full amount of receipts when each 
transfer toward the payment is made. 
  The new letter of the State Tax Service is devoted to the 
taxation of receipts of foreign legal entities not operating 
through permanent representative offices. The document specifies 
what exactly amounts to taxable receipts in their case. In 
particular, as the letter notes, in addition to receipts for 
leasing property located on the territory of Russia, the tax 
should also be withheld on receipts from the increment in the 
cost of property received as a result of its conveyance, for 
example, sale. The notion of "taxable interest receipts" has 
been expanded considerably: Not only will amounts due on debt 
obligations now be taxed at the source, but also the interest on 
insurance premiums, fines, or penalties for violation of 
contractual obligations. 
  However, innovations concerning the taxation of trading 
broker operations attracted the greatest attention of KOMMERSANT 
experts. The tax is still not levied on the receipts of foreign 
companies from trading operations. However, when imported goods 
are sold in Russia on trading brokerage terms (for example, 
under a consignment contract), the Russian company will have to 
withhold the tax prior to remitting abroad the portion of 
receipts generated by the sale of goods and due to the foreign 
company. 
  In the process, the amount of such receipts will be 
determined as the difference between the sale price set by the 
foreign company and the price at which the Russian intermediary 
actually sold the goods. Of course, in this case the 
"difference" means the amount directly remitted to the foreign 
company; the receipts of the Russian enterprise are taxed 
through usual procedures. 
  It is significant that these procedures for the calculation 
of taxable income may only be used if documents confirming the 
importation of goods from abroad by a foreign legal entity are 
available. The entire amount of gross proceeds paid to the 
foreign company will be taxed otherwise. It is quite 
understandable that agreements on the avoidance of dual taxation 
between Russia and other states which are in force are taken 
into account in the taxation of receipts. 
  The new expanded listing of the receipts of foreign legal 
entities taxed at the source of receipts which takes effect at 
the time of official publication will make it possible for the 
tax organs to considerably replenish the Russian treasury and 
solve the problem of the failure of foreign companies to pay 
taxes on receipts generated on the territory of Russia. 
  [Boxed item] Amounts received by foreign companies in the 
following forms shall be taxed: 
  --receipts from the profits of an enterprise established in 
Russia with foreign investment; 
  --additional remunerations for shareholders in monetary or 
other form; 
  --profits distributed by check investment funds; 
  --interest on debt obligations of any kind, on various 
insurance premiums, fines, and penalties for the violation of 
contractual and debt obligations; 
  --receipts from the use of copyrights, inventions, trade 
marks, and other similar assets, as well as the business 
reputation, clients, and cadres of the company; 
  --receipts from leasing property located on the territory of 
Russia, as well as receipts from the increment of the cost of 
property generated as a result of its conveyance; 
  --all other receipts whose generation is not associated with 
operations conducted through a permanent representative office, 
including receipts for use of know-how, consultations, and 
freight transportation. [End boxed item]

administration deputy chief, received Amsa Amin, Republic of 
Bangladesh ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to 
Russia, who was visiting Novosibirsk, as he said, on a goodwill 
mission to restore business relations and learn about the oblast. 
  This is the first time Novosibirsk has received such a 
prestigious guest from a distant Asian country. Noting this 
fact, V. Nekhoroshkov emphasized that the ambassador's visit 
marked the beginning of extensive contacts between Bangladesh 
and Novosibirsk Oblast in various areas, but particularly in the 
field of economics, culture, education, and science. 
  The parties exchanged information about possible business 
cooperation and reached the conclusion that it could be arranged 
on a long-term basis since there was common interest in this. 
  A. Amin intends to visit industrial enterprises and 
scientific, cultural, and educational institutions in 
Novosibirsk.

<F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, by </F>
Igor Dunayev; place and date not given: "Croatia Open to Russia"] 
  [Text] Two years ago, on 26 May, diplomatic relations 
were established between the Russian Federation and Croatia. 
Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic answers questions from 
OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. 
  It is easy for journalists to speak with the 43-year-old 
prime minister. The conversation proceeds as though with an old 
colleague. Because immediately after graduating from the legal 
faculty at Zagreb University, the future head of state worked 
for two years on the radio and for three years after that he was 
editor in chief of the journal PRAVNIK (lawyer). At the very 
beginning of our discussion, Nikica Valentic especially 
emphasized that from 1990 through the spring of 1993 he headed 
up the largest oil company in Croatia, INA, which has almost 30 
years of experience in successful partnership with Russia. 
  I was interested in the possibility of obtaining firsthand 
information about the economic situation in the country. If we 
recall the recent past, Croatia accounted for about $2 billion 
in Soviet-Yugoslav commercial exchange. 
  [Dunayev] What were the economic results with which Croatia 
celebrated its anniversary? After all, it acquired independence 
even before Russia did--30 May marks the fourth birthday of the 
young European state... 
  [Valentic] Like all former socialist countries, we inherited 
an economic mechanism from the past. But, in spite of the 
consequences of war and destruction (about half a million 
refugees are in the country, living on state welfare) and the 
fact that one-quarter of the internationally recognized 
territories of Croatia are occupied, we are conducting radical 
economic reforms, although we have not received a single dollar 
of outside aid. We are also consistently implementing 
privatization of enterprises and banks. About one-quarter of 
them already have been privatized. 
  Croatia has one of the lowest inflation rates as compared to 
other former socialist countries, which became possible as a 
result of rather tough macroeconomic monetary policy. While just 
recently the inflation rate approached 3,000-4,000 percent, it 
now has declined to the European "standard" of 10 percent. We 
have stopped printing money and realistically appraise labor 
remuneration and enterprises profitability. Over the past two 
years, foreign currency reserves have reached $2 billion. At the 
same time, our foreign debt is no more than $2 billion. The 
average wage rose to 400 marks [currency as published] a month, 
and, by the end of the year, will increase by another 100 marks 
[currency as published], which will place our country among the 
leaders of the former socialist bloc states. Croatian experience 
has attracted world attention, since it is a unique example of a 
successful economic reform in extremely unfavorable 
circumstances. 
  [Dunayev] What are the prospects of economic reform in 
Croatia? 
  [Valentic] This depends to a large extent on the success of 
privatization, as well as structural changes in key industrial 
sectors: shipbuilding, food processing industry, and 
metalworking. Croatia possesses exceptional economic resources. 
First and foremost, it has about 4,000 kilometers of Adriatic 
shoreline, famous throughout the world for its clean water and 
appeal to tourists. Croatian agriculture can produce European 
quality foodstuffs in quantities twice as great as the domestic 
need. Two-thirds of the gas and oil used in the country is 
produced in Croatia. Therefore, we can maintain that, under 
"nonwar" circumstances, Croatia could be an unquestionable 
economic reform leader among the former socialist countries. 
Income from tourism alone can bring up to $5 billion annually. 
  Croatia's geographic position is extremely favorable--it 
sits 
at the crossroads between the West and the East; at the same 
time, about 3 million Croatians, whose experience is invaluable 
for the country, live in the West. You have already noticed that 
we do not have any problems with foreign currency, which can be 
purchased and sold freely. Croatia is a European country that is 
small but open to international cooperation. Our goal is to join 
European structures, without any borders or customs. And I have 
no doubt that in the final count economic progress in Croatia 
will succeed. 
  [Dunayev] What is your opinion of the state of 
Russo-Croatian 
economic relations? 
  [Valentic] I see it as exceptionally fruitful. I am also 
certain that the process of change both in Croatia and in Russia 
will bring the business circles of our countries closer together 
in a variety of spheres. Both our friendly relations and good 
political contacts, which we value very much, work in favor of 
it. I would like to particularly emphasize the opportunities for 
tourism in Croatia, since lately we have noticed an increase in 
the number of visitors from such countries as Slovenia, Hungary, 
Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. They are confident of 
the comfort and complete safety of their vacationing in Croatia. 
We hope very much to see Russian tourists as well in our 
Adriatic region; they are welcome and are well-known here. 
  ...The prime minister presented us with a gift--a photo 
album 
with colorful photos of the Adriatic shore and islands. And 
confessed that hardly anyone can tell these days how many there 
are of these islands. Even the official figure quoted by tourist 
reference books seems fantastic--1,185. To see for yourself that 
all this is true, we invite you to watch a special report 
devoted to tourist attractions of Croatia, which will be shown 
on Russian television in the program "Business in Russia" on 30 
May. Precisely on the day of the national holiday--Croatia's 
Independence Day...

  [Text] Yesterday in Moscow, S. Smirnov, president of the 
Russian Federation Chamber of Trade and Industry, and A. 
Kruglov, chairman of the Russian Federation State Customs 
Committee, signed an agreement on cooperation between the 
chamber and the committee in the area of facilitating the 
development of foreign economic activities. It was decided to 
exchange information, hold joint events, and train cadres. A 
joint consultative council will be set to deal with issues of 
mutual interest, including matters of dispute. 
  One of the most important tasks of both organizations is 
preparing for the Russian Federation to join international 
agreements on the so-called ATA [authorization for temporary 
admission] coupon books (documents accompanying cargo during its 
temporary stay on the country's territory--for instance, 
exposition exhibits).

<F P=106> [Comments by Gennadiy Shcherbakov, main administration chief </F>
of the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations, recorded by DELOVOY MIR commentator Yuriy Yershov, 
under the rubric "Cooperation": "Russia-India: There Are 
Problems. But They Are Solvable"] 
  [Text] We have to admit with regret that trade 
between Russia and India had been steadily declining lately, and 
in 1992 fell off by more than half. Last year, however, the 
decline in mutual trade was halted. Having given up on clearing, 
we have developed a new legal base that allows us to move to a 
flexible system of reciprocal payments. The trading partners now 
have a choice of the form most acceptable for them, in 
particular, payments in convertible hard currency, or clearing 
through barter and exchange of goods. 
  The main factor that determines the prospects for the 
development of Russian-Indian trade and economic relations and 
promises an increase in bilateral trade is the expansion of 
direct ties between commercial structures of both countries. I 
hope that this year the trade turnover between our countries 
will increase to approximately $2 billion. 
  We are happy to see that more than 500 Indian companies 
currently work rather actively in the Russian market. Also, in 
my opinion, the companies that compete most successfully are 
those that take the risk of using trade forms that are most 
progressive in the existing conditions: selling goods from 
warehouses, deliveries with extended payment terms, and 
combining export with import. 
  To our chagrin, we also have to mention a number of negative 
points, which lately are becoming an increasingly frequent 
phenomenon. I mean shipments to Russia from India of goods of 
low, and sometimes unacceptable, quality--tea not fit for 
drinking, tobacco that does not meet the standards stipulated in 
the contracts, footwear that does not meet the norm, and so on. 
All of this, alas, causes a prejudice against all Indian goods 
among Russian consumers. This is a very dangerous trend, capable 
of seriously damaging our trade and economic relations. Some 
measures have been taken to stop such incidents. When I was a 
trade representative in Delhi, we made official representations 
to India's Ministry of Trade. So far, unfortunately, there is no 
change for the better. 
  Because of the complexity of the issue, work is dragging on 
forming a system of utilizing the means coming from India as 
payments on credits provided in the past by the Soviet Union. 
This year we will be able to utilize more than 30 billion 
rupees, or about $1 billion, to purchase goods in India and 
complete payments on goods shipped to Russia earlier but not yet 
paid for, as well as give Russian organizations the ability to 
use the money previously frozen in the Foreign Economic Bank's 
accounts. 
  We gave to the Indian side tentative lists of goods we are 
planning to buy in India as centralized purchases. In the near 
future, we expect to complete the selection of trade 
organizations that will handle such purchases. A serious 
obstacle in this respect is the shortage of means on the part of 
Russian customers to cover in rubles the rupees received from 
the state. The most realistic way of overcoming these 
difficulties, in my opinion, is for Indian partners to arrange 
for installment payments--naturally, on mutually profitable 
terms agreed upon in each particular deal. 
  And one more, completely new, point in the matter of 
utilizing the Indian debt. This year, for the first time, there 
is a plan to sell a certain amount of state money through an 
experimental auction in Indian rupees to Russian organizations 
and firms for subsequent purchases of goods in India. The 
mechanism for such an auction is being worked out now, but this 
will take some time--as I said, this is a completely new 
undertaking. 
  I think, however, that it is not advisable to link the 
development of trade relations just to the utilization of debt. 
Our aim should be to expand direct contacts between commercial 
structures of both countries. There is also a rich potential in 
working with Russian regions, as well as in deliveries of 
machinery and technical equipment from Russia to India. In 
addition, we do not want Indian businessmen to limit themselves 
to trade alone, but rather to invest capital more actively in 
Russia's production sphere, despite existing difficulties. 
  We, in turn, are ready to buy in India for rupees not just 
traditional goods but also machinery and technical products, as 
well as, for instance, semifinished footwear or woolen knitwear. 
At this point, however, we cannot do it in needed quantities, 
because the Indian Ministry of Finance has set a 100-percent 
value-added tax on imported components, as compared to the 33 
percent for exporting analogous goods for hard currency. 
Essentially, with respect to such goods, the Russian market 
found itself in a discriminatory position. I hope that this 
problem also will be resolved soon. 
  We have to somehow untie another knot as well. Russian 
exporters have two types of accounts in Indian banks--the 
so-called escrow account and the special-rupee account. For some 
reason, unlike the former, the latter does not allow Russian 
importers to re-export Indian goods. 
  Of course, development of ties between us is being 
constrained by unresolved transportation issues. As is known, in 
the past the main flow of freight in the Russian-Indian trade 
went through Odessa and Ilyichevsk. Now it is difficult for 
Russia to work with these ports. Therefore, the department of 
maritime transport decided to allocate two piers in Novorossiysk 
specifically to support mutual shipping. True, these piers need 
reconstruction in order to handle containers there. 
Nevertheless, representatives in the Indian Embassy who have 
visited Novorossiysk believe that, thanks to these two piers, 
the transportation problem can be resolved. 
  As you can see, there are quite a few issues to deal with. 
But all of them can be overcome--all we need is enough will on 
both sides. Which, I am sure, both sides have. 
  This material has been prepared on the basis of the report 
at 
the recent seminar "Trade and Business Relations Between India 
and Russia," organized by the Indian Embassy in the Russian 
Federation, the Russian Foreign Policy Foundation, and the 
Association of Indian Business in Moscow.

<F P=106> [Draft proposal signed "President of the Republic of </F>
Kazakhstan": "Formation of a Eurasian Union of States"] 
  [Text] At the present time all CIS countries are continuing 
to experience a profound crisis in all spheres of social 
life--the economy, policy, ideology, and inter-nation 
relations--and socioeconomic tension is on the rise. This is 
happening under conditions where the development of the CIS is 
being determined by two trends. On the one hand the continued 
formation of national statehood is taking place, on the other, a 
trend toward the integration of the CIS countries is being 
observed. 
  The CIS, as an interstate association, is performing a 
positive role in the legal structuring of the interstate 
relations of its constituent countries. CIS potential is not 
exhausted. Nonetheless, the structure of CIS organs that exists 
at the present time is preventing the realization to the full 
extent of the available integration potential. Not only the 
leaders of the CIS countries, but also a large part of the 
population of these states are calling attention to this. 
  The experience of CIS functioning in past years shows the 
need for a transition to a new level of integration that would 
guarantee observance of the jointly adopted commitments by all 
the participating states. 
  International practice shows that any interstate association 
goes through different stages in its development and is 
supplemented by new forms of cooperation. The CIS has 
appreciable advantages--the high degree of integration of the 
economy and similar sociopolitical structures and mentality of 
the population and also the multinational composition of the 
majority of the republics and common historical traditions. 
  All this testifies to the need for a combination of the 
process of national-state building and the preservation and 
development on this basis of interstate integration processes. 
The logic of history is such that integration in the world 
community is possible only by the joint efforts of all CIS 
countries taking advantage of the powerful integration potential 
that has taken shape over decades. 
  The actual conditions show that while perfecting the 
mechanisms of the CIS, we should not regard it as the sole form 
of association. As practice has shown, the further development 
of the CIS countries is being held back by the insufficiency of 
the intrinsic potential of each of them. The development of the 
latter is possible only with the economic integration of the 
countries of the post-Soviet space on a new, market basis. 
  The inherited structures of the single national economic 
complex are continuing to corrode. Outmoded forms of economic 
relations are objectively dying away. At the same time perfected 
production engineering relations corresponding to the economic 
interests of our countries in the near and distant future are 
being disrupted. 
  Market reformations have universal regularities. No country 
can ignore them without succumbing here to economic romanticism. 
It would be expedient to combine the efforts geared to market 
reform of the economies of the countries of the former USSR on 
the basis of the close business relations that have already 
taken shape over the course of decades. 
  As world practice shows, only with collective efforts are 
transitional societies in a position to undertake successful 
modernization. At the same time, on the other hand, we see that 
the continuing attempts to tackle this task by individual 
countries of the CIS alone are, as before, proving unsuccessful. 
They will remain such until the realization of economic 
integration on new conditions. On the other hand, the 
unrealistic nature of the attempts at a reorientation toward 
some regional economic associations in the far abroad is obvious. 
  The lack of coordination in price policy in respect to 
exported raw material, which is having a negative effect on the 
states' economic position, has become a serious problem for 
them. On the other hand, this is introducing an element of 
instability to the settled world economic relations and forcing 
third countries to adopt strict sanctions. Exports of raw 
material and energy resources are our states' most important 
revenue item. There is an urgent need in this connection for a 
unified export policy system within the CIS countries in the 
interest of all the participants with the adoption of serious 
measures in the event of some country's failure to observe the 
quotas and prices agreed upon. 
  An important component of the successful implementation of 
market reforms is an improvement in the national legislative 
bodies of the CIS countries. Further modernization is impossible 
without the rapprochement of the legislative foundations of 
economic activity, inasmuch as the current differences between 
them are becoming a serious obstacle to integrative processes in 
the economy. 
  Considering the differences among the countries in levels of 
development of the market economy and the democratization of 
political processes, we propose the formation of an additional 
integration structure--a Eurasian Union--in harmony with the 
activity of the CIS. Account is taken here of the polyvariant 
nature of the integration and the different pace and the 
heterogeneousness and varying vectors in the development of the 
CIS states. This is reason to speak of the urgent need for the 
formation of a new economic order in the CIS. The purpose is the 
harmonization of economic policy and the adoption of joint 
programs of economic reforms binding on the participating states. 
  The socioeconomic and political crisis is occurring against 
the background of the multinational composition of the 
population of practically all the CIS states. As a consequence, 
interethnic tension leading not only to intrastate tension but 
also, in a number of cases, growing into interstate conflicts is 
on the rise. This situation is undermining the very institution 
of the CIS. Consequently, it is essential by joint efforts to 
devise mechanisms for deterring, localizing, and extinguishing 
various types of conflicts. 
  At the present time all CIS countries are searching for 
forms 
of constitutional arrangement appropriate for the internal 
conditions. But, as practice shows, neither the unitary nor the 
federative CIS states can be considered completely stable. 
  A solution to the questions of economic integration dictates 
the need for the creation of political institutions possessing a 
sufficient volume of authority. They must incorporate within 
themselves the regulatory functions of states' mutual relations 
in the economic, political, legal, environmental, cultural, and 
educational spheres proper. 
  Thus the time has come for the removal of the obstacles to 
interaction at the highest level and the simultaneous creation 
of the instruments for this. 
  A process of disintegration in the sphere of science, 
culture, and education is taking place at this time. The once 
unified cultural and educational space is becoming disconnected. 
The claim under these conditions that "science has no borders" 
is proving to be simply unfounded. Against the background of the 
intensifying socioeconomic difficulties the drain of specialists 
from the sphere of science, culture, and education, the decline 
in intellectual potential, and the fall in the standard and 
quality of education are increasing. These processes are leading 
not only to the rupture of the once unified system, but also to 
isolation from the cultural and scientific achievements of world 
civilization. 
  At the same time, on the other hand, the aspiration to 
intensify integration processes in the economy and policy should 
be based on the preservation and development of a concerted 
policy in the sphere of culture, education, and science. It is 
essential to preserve and augment the internationalization of 
the processes of the acquisition and practical use of new 
knowledge. The integration of R&amp;D in the S&amp;T sphere has 
become 
an inalienable part of the globalization of industrial activity 
in general. 
  The isolation of the post-Soviet space from the world 
cultural and scientific community is fraught with the danger of 
a new stage in the lag of the technological sphere. 
  A key task for the new states is the assurance of 
territorial 
integrity and security. At the present time the post-Soviet 
space is a zone of instability and the combination of various 
types of conflicts and is also experiencing the impact of 
centers of tension outside of the CIS. The guarding of the 
exterior borders and the stabilization of the situation in the 
conflict regions may be accomplished only by the joint efforts 
of all the states concerned and requires the concerted approach 
of the participants to a range of questions of a defense nature. 
  The problem of environmental safety remains one of the most 
painful and unresolved problems in the CIS countries. The 
environmental tension has been caused by a number of factors. 
The consequences of the testing of nuclear weapons and the 
activity of the nuclear power stations, the contamination of the 
environment with industrial waste, and the degradation of the 
natural environment as a result of man's economic activity (the 
running dry of water basins, deforestation, soil erosion, and so 
forth) may be attributed to these. 
  These problems are urgent for practically all CIS countries, 
especially since the main zones of ecological disaster are 
located in border areas, as a rule. They have been caused by the 
community of the evolved production engineering base and the 
methods of economic activity, the basis of which was the 
extensive focus. Not one of these problems can be resolved today 
by the independent efforts of one, even the biggest, state. 
Environmental preservation is a global task requiring 
large-scale capital investments and a combination of the efforts 
of all states. 
  The draft of the creation of a new integrative association, 
provisionally entitled the Eurasian Union, is offered for 
discussion. 
<H8>  Eurasian Union </H8>
  The Eurasian Union is a union of equal independent states 
that is geared to the realization of the national-state 
interests of each participant and that has an aggregate 
integration potential. The Eurasian Union is a form of the 
integration of sovereign states aimed at a strengthening of 
stability and security and socioeconomic modernization in the 
post-Soviet space. 
  Economic interests determine the bases of the convergence of 
the independent states. The political institutions of the 
Eurasian Union should adequately reflect these interests and 
contribute to economic integration. 
<H8>  I. Principles of Association </H8>
  The following principles and mechanism for the formation of 
the Eurasian Union are proposed: 
  national referenda or parliamentary decisions on states' 
membership in the Eurasian Union; 
  participant signing of a treaty on creation of the Eurasian 
Union based on principles of equality, noninterference in one 
another's internal affairs, and respect for sovereignty, 
territorial integrity, and the sanctity of borders. The treaty 
shall contain the legal and organizational prerequisites for an 
extension of integration in the direction of the formation of an 
economic, currency, and political union; 
  associate membership in the Eurasian Union is not permitted; 
  decisions shall be adopted in the Eurasian Union on the 
basis 
of the principle of a necessary majority of four-fifths of the 
total number of participants. 
  Independent states shall be members of the Eurasian Union 
given fulfillment of the following preliminary conditions: 
  obligatory observance of adopted interstate agreements; 
  mutual recognition of the evolved state and political 
institutions of Eurasian Union participants; 
  recognition of territorial integrity and sanctity of 
borders; 
  renunciation of economic, political, and other forms of 
pressure in interstate relations; 
  termination of mutual hostilities. 
  New countries shall be admitted to the Eurasian Union 
following the presentation of expert findings concerning their 
readiness to join the Eurasian Union by the unanimous vote of 
all members of the Eurasian Union. The expert findings shall be 
produced by a body formed on a parity basis by the states that 
have expressed consent to become members of the Eurasian Union. 
  Eurasian Union states may participate in other integration 
associations, including the CIS, on the basis of associate or 
permanent membership, or they may have observer status. 
  Each participant may withdraw from the Eurasian Union, 
having 
given the other states advance notice no later than six months 
prior to the adoption of the decision. 
  The formation of the following supranational bodies is 
proposed: 
  A Council of Heads of State and Heads of Government of the 
Eurasian Union--the supreme organ of political leadership of the 
Eurasian Union. Each participant shall preside in the Eurasian 
Union for six months at a time in Russian alphabetical order. 
  The supreme consultative-deliberative body is the Eurasian 
Union Parliament. The parliament shall be formed by way of the 
delegation of deputies of the parliaments of the participants on 
the basis of equal representation from each participant or by 
way of direct elections. Decisions by the Eurasian Union 
Parliament shall take effect following their ratification by the 
Eurasian Union state parliaments. The question of ratification 
must be considered within one month. 
  The main area of Eurasian Union parliamentary activity shall 
be to coordinate the legislating bodies of the participants to 
ensure the development of a single economic space and the 
accomplishment of tasks pertaining to the protection of the 
social rights and interests of individuals and mutual respect 
for state sovereignty and the rights of citizens in Eurasian 
Union states. 
  A common legal base regulating the mutual relations of the 
economic transactors of the participants shall be created via 
the Eurasian Union Parliament. 
  A Eurasian Union Foreign Ministers Council for the purpose 
of 
the coordination of foreign policy activity. 
  The Eurasian Union Interstate Executive Committee--the 
permanent executive and control body. The leader of the 
Executive Committee shall be appointed in turn from 
representatives of the participants by the heads of state of the 
Eurasian Union for a time that they determine. The structures of 
the Executive Committee shall be formed from representatives of 
all the participants. 
  The Eurasian Union, in the shape of its Executive Committee, 
should acquire the status of observer in a number of important 
international organizations. 
  The Eurasian Union Executive Committee Information Bureau. 
The adoption of a special commitment or law by the participants 
to prevent unfriendly words about the parties to the treaty that 
could damage relations between them. 
  An Education, Culture, and Science Council. The shaping of a 
concerted educational policy and cultural and scientific 
cooperation and exchange and joint activity in the creation of 
textbooks and aids. 
  For the more in-depth coordination and efficiency of the 
activity of the Eurasian Union countries, the creation in each 
of them of a state committee (ministry) for Eurasian Union 
affairs would be expedient. 
  At the level of ministers of Eurasian Union countries the 
holding of regular meetings and consultations on questions of 
health care, education, labor and employment, the environment, 
culture, the fight against crime, and so forth. 
  Encouragement of the activity of nongovernment organizations 
in various spheres of cooperation in accordance with the 
national legislation of the Eurasian Union participants. 
  The official language of the Eurasian Union, together with 
the functioning of the national bodies of language legislation, 
shall be Russian. 
  Citizenship. The unrestricted movement of citizens within 
the 
Eurasian Union will require the coordination of external--in 
relation to third countries--visa policy. Upon a change in the 
country of residence within the Eurasian Union, an individual 
shall, if he so wishes, automatically acquire the citizenship of 
the other country. 
  A city at the intersection of Europe and Asia, Kazan or 
Samara, for example, could be proposed as the capital of the 
Eurasian Union. 
<H8>  II. The Economy </H8>
  For the purpose of creating a single economic space, it is 
proposed to form within the framework of the Eurasian Union a 
number of supranational coordinating structures: 
  a commission for economics under the auspices of the 
Eurasian 
Union Council of the Heads of State elaborating the main 
directions of economic reforms within the framework of the 
Eurasian Union with regard to the interests of the national 
states and presenting them for confirmation to the Eurasian 
Union Council of Heads of State; 
  a commission for raw material resources of Eurasian Union 
exporting countries for the harmonization and confirmation of 
prices and quotas for exported raw material resources and energy 
and the signing of the corresponding interstate agreement. 
Coordination of policy in the sphere of the mining and sale of 
gold and other precious metals; 
  a fund for economic and technical cooperation formed from 
contributions of the Eurasian Union countries. The fund would 
finance promising, research-intensive economic and S&amp;T 
programs 
and assist in the accomplishment of a wide range of tasks, 
including legal, tax, financial, environmental, and so forth; 
  a commission for interstate financial and industrial groups 
and joint ventures; 
  an Eurasian Union international investment bank; 
  an Eurasian Union interstate arbitration tribunal for 
economic matters legally ruling on contentious issues and 
imposing penal sanctions; 
  a commission for the introduction of a monetary unit of 
settlement (transferable ruble). 
<H8>  III. Science, Culture, Education </H8>
  It is proposed to implement a number of measures to preserve 
the potential achieved in previous decades and increase 
integration in this sphere: 
  to create Eurasian Union common research centers for basic 
research in the sphere of modern learning; 
  to create a Eurasian Union fund for the development of 
scientific research uniting the research outfits of various 
countries; 
  to create a committee for relations in the sphere of 
culture, 
science, and education under the auspices of the Eurasian Union 
Council of Heads of Government; 
<H8>  IV. Defense </H8>
  The conclusion within the Eurasian Union framework of the 
following accords is proposed: 
  a treaty on joint actions to strengthen the national armed 
forces of Eurasian Union members and to protect the exterior 
borders of the Eurasian Union. 
  The Eurasian Union proposes the creation of a common defense 
space for the coordination of defense activity: 
  the formation of a collective Eurasian Union peacekeeping 
force for maintaining stability and extinguishing conflicts in 
the participating countries and between them. With the consent 
of Eurasian Union participants, in accordance with international 
rules of law, the dispatch of the peacekeeping force to conflict 
zones on the territory of the Eurasian Union; 
  the presentation of a collective appeal of Eurasian Union 
countries to international organizations, including the UN 
Security Council, for conferring the status of peacekeeping 
force on the joint contingent; 
  the creation of an interstate center for problems of nuclear 
disarmament with the participation of representatives of 
international organizations. 
  All states of the Eurasian Union, aside from Russia, shall 
maintain their nuclear-free status. 
<H8>  V. The Environment </H8>
  The formation as soon as possible of the following 
mechanisms 
is essential: 
  an environment fund under the auspices of the Eurasian Union 
Council of Heads of State realizing within the framework of the 
Eurasian Union environmental programs and financed by all the 
participating states; 
  the coordination of operations with international 
organizations to reduce the degree of environmental pollution; 
  the adoption of short-term and long-term programs on major 
problems of environmental restoration and the elimination of the 
consequences of ecological catastrophes (the Aral, Chernobyl, 
the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Range); 
  the adoption of a Eurasian Union interstate treaty on the 
storage of nuclear waste. 
  History is affording us an opportunity to enter the 21st 
Century by the civilized path. One method, in our view, is the 
realization of the integration potential of the initiative 
pertaining to the creation of a Eurasian Union reflecting the 
objective logic of the development of the post-Soviet space and 
the will of the peoples of the former USSR to integration.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sultan Sartayev, member of the Committee on </F>
Interparliamentary Communications of the Supreme Council and 
corresponding member of the National Academy of Sciences of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, by KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA writer Igor 
Cherepanov; place and date not given: "Only a Renewed Government 
Can Continue the Economic Reforms. Parliament Has Presented a 
Bill to the Executive Power"] 
  [Text] The deputies supported by a majority of votes 
the statement of the Kazakhstan parliament of no confidence in 
the socioeconomic course of the Cabinet of Ministers of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan. In connection with this event our 
correspondent met with a member of the Committee on 
Interparliamentary Communications of the Supreme Council, a 
corresponding member of the National Academy of Sciences of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan Sultan Sartayev and asked him several 
questions. 
  [Cherepanov] Sultan Sartayevich, what do the members of 
parliament see as the groundlessness of the government policy? 
  [Sartayev] It seems to me that we have strayed a long way 
from the discussions to the effect that "it is necessary to 
conduct reforms." As today's reality shows, there have been no 
deeply considered economic transformations. This is stated 
unequivocally both by our economists and by our esteemed 
colleagues from nearby foreign countries. Therefore the majority 
of the deputy corps have decided that the government has 
exhausted its reform possibilities, and that was the point of 
departure for the essentially unprecedented statement. 
  [Cherepanov] In your opinion, what was the principal mistake 
or, if you will, omission of the creators of our economic policy? 
  [Sartayev] First of all that we are unable to intelligently 
dispose of foreign credits and check to make sure whether they 
are used as intended for target programs or thoughtlessly 
wasted. After all, according to press reports a considerable 
amount is being awarded to the republic. 
  Second, the bank credit system in its present form is 
clearly 
working against the commodity producer. Everyone knows that 
production cannot develop without a long-term financial policy. 
This policy is destructive to the state. The reforms will not 
move a step forward without support from small- and medium-sized 
business. 
  But as far as I know, they are the ones being bypassed in 
the 
distribution of credit, which gets to those that have already 
blazed a trail to the market and have become strong enough. 
Apparently we must fully revise the legislative acts, releasing 
the entrepreneur from the economic fetters. This is apparently a 
task for a renewed government. I have not misspoken here. I 
think that the president--and here the deputies agree with 
me--must distance himself from the present Cabinet of Ministers. 
  [Cherepanov] The appearance of the statement coincided in 
time with the creation of the "shadow" government headed by 
Supreme Council Deputy Vitaliy Roze. What do you think about 
that? 
  [Sartayev] The appearance of the "shadow" will to a certain 
degree serve as a catalyst for a more rational, weighed policy 
on the part of our present government. But I must say that with 
the presidential form of rule its appearance in and of itself is 
nonsense. 
  [Cherepanov] This is probably not the last act of 
disagreement of the deputies regarding serious questions of 
state policy. 
  [Sartayev] Many analysts predicted that the new Supreme 
Council would be "tame." Fortunately, the predictions were 
wrong. If the parliament were to unanimously approve everything 
proposed by the executive power without discussing it or delving 
into its essence, no progress would be forthcoming. This 
statement shows that the deputies have seriously undertaken to 
improve the economic, social, and legal policy. Let me emphasize 
once again that the Supreme Council must revise the entire tax 
and credit system and banking legislation in order to avoid a 
repetition of the situation in which the reforms run up against 
a blind wall.

<F P=106> [Article by KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent Andrey </F>
Zhdanov: "How Will the President Respond?"] 
  [Text] On 20 February of this year, commenting on the next 
steps of Nursultan Nazarbayev and the republic Cabinet of 
Ministers in the area of economic policy, KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA 
noted: "One can expect more battles over the January-February 
package of economic documents of the executive power--at the 
executive level, in the new parliament. The difficulty of the 
position of the president and government is that the executive 
power has only a month and a half or two months or maybe even 
less to prove the correctness of the acts that were adopted. If 
during this time there is not at least a minimal, even symbolic 
slow-up of inflation and the decline of production, the results 
of the discussion in parliament will be unpredictable." "Risk is 
a noble but not always an appreciated cause." Today, knowing the 
content of the statement of the Supreme Council which was made 
public by the Kazakhstan press yesterday, one can say that the 
risky steps of the executive power did not produce the expected 
results and our prediction, alas, turned out to be right, albeit 
with a delay of a month and a half. 
  The refinement of the wording of a number of places in the 
document adopted by the Supreme Council on the evening of 27 
May, which contains the agreement that there is no "alternative 
to the course toward in-depth reform," the desire to "reach a 
compromise and accord among the various political forces," and 
the "readiness for constructive dialogue with the president" 
does not change the essence. The parliament is unambiguously 
assessing the present results of the actions of the Cabinet of 
Ministers and leveling against it the serious accusation that 
the government is essentially blocking the declared course 
toward a market economy. In the opinion of the Supreme Council, 
this has led to "economic chaos" and therefore it expressed no 
confidence in the socioeconomic and legal policy of the 
government. 
  Near the end of the regular round in the struggle among the 
various branches of power, the beginning of which was the 
introduction of the national currency and the disbanding of the 
councils, the new parliament dealt a painful blow to the 
president. Nor was it soothed by the decision finally adopted by 
the head of state to distance himself from the Cabinet of 
Ministers (the recent separation of the staffs of the government 
and the president) or by Nazarbayev's increasing criticism of 
members of his team, or by the activation in recent months of 
foreign political and foreign economic activity in a desire to 
win support from foreign politicians, potential investors, and 
international financial institutes. 
  It would be difficult to hope for any other reaction from a 
legislator when there was an eightfold decline of the exchange 
rate of the tenge from the time of introduction, the permanent 
shutdown of not dozens but hundreds of Kazakhstan productions, a 
reduction of the national income since the beginning of this 
year as compared to the corresponding period of last 1992 by 
almost 40 percent, a 30-percent reduction of industrial 
production as compared to last year, and numerous other 
frightening economic minuses. And it is difficult to argue with 
the legislator who under these conditions has seen the only 
possibility of avoiding paralysis of power in dialogue among its 
branches and social and political forces in order to create a 
national program of reform and form a government capable of 
carrying it out. 
  How will the president respond? He will probably not be 
enthusiastic about the Supreme Council's intentions to 
concentrate their attention on consideration of presidential 
edicts adopted in the absence of a legislative organ and, in the 
opinion of experts, containing a good number of contradictions 
with existing legislation, as well as on the performance of 
oversight functions and international treaties subject to 
ratification, and also the parliament's intention to 
legislatively limit the executive power in disposing of state 
property. 
  The neutral wording of these points of the parliament's 
statement should not deceive the public either: It is 
essentially a question of a comprehensive expert evaluation and 
a probable change of approaches to such key areas of reform as 
privatization, economic integration into the world community, 
and the role of the state with respect to the commodity producer 
with all forms of property. And here it will probably be 
impossible to avoid significant compromises. 
  ...Regardless of how effective the knock-down in the boxing 
ring may have looked, when summing up the results of the fight 
the judges count it as only one well-aimed blow, one point. 
Politics and economics are not boxing. Politics and economics 
for the authorities are more like an endless chess match. For 
society it would be preferable to have them moderated and 
stationary in nature. Now all the participants are in the end 
game. The legislator has made his move. In the end game you 
cannot be slow, and the president knows this. 
  Being superstitious about predictions, we shall refrain from 
them, especially rash ones.

<F P=106> [Article by KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent Zhanna </F>
Oyshibayeva: "Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council Explains 
Position of Deputies"] 
  [Text] Our readers are now familiar with the text of the 
statement of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
which expresses a lack of confidence in the socioeconomic and 
legal policy of the government and contains a call for dialogue 
among all branches of power. On 31 May in the Supreme Council a 
news conference was held by Deputy Chairman of the Supreme 
Council of the Republic of Kazakhstan Marat Ospanov with 
journalists. As he admitted, this was his first meeting with the 
press. The occasion was Marat Ospanov's desire to explain to the 
mass media certain details and circumstances related to the 
aforementioned statement. 
  What factors motivated the members of parliament to do this? 
At the news conference Marat Ospanov gave these explanations. 
The Supreme Council is in favor of market reforms and in general 
supports the president's course. But our economy is in a 
lamentable condition today. In its statement the Supreme Council 
notes that this is blocking the movement toward the market. The 
work of the government has become ineffective; it has no unified 
team. Good ideas are quickly dispersed as the team members pass 
them on from one to the other. Taking these and other facts into 
account, the members of parliament decided to make the 
statement. The draft of it was discussed in two stages. In the 
first it was decided how constitutional the statement would be. 
In the second they discussed the form for transmitting it. The 
discussion, in Marat Ospanov's words, was lively and 
interesting. First the document was brought up for discussion by 
the committee; after that it was considered by the deputies, and 
then the plenary session and the editorial commission. 
  It was also noted that the Supreme Council cannot work in 
isolation; it needs contact with the president and his team. 
After all, the Supreme Council is not calling for the 
resignation of the government, since it does not have the 
constitutional right to do that. Now the authors of the 
statement are impatiently awaiting the response from the 
president. 
  How did Nursultan Nazarbayev react to the statement? This 
question was answered by Konstantin Kolpakov, the president's 
personal representative. "At my own risk," Konstantin 
Anatolyevich remarked, "I will say that the president addressed 
the statement calmly and attentively. And in general this 
expression of a lack of confidence in the government 
socioeconomic and legal policy was not a surprise to Nursultan 
Abishevich. He supports the desire for cooperation and dialogue."

<F P=106> [KAZTAG report: "Government Invites Supreme Council to </F>
Constructive Dialogue"] 
  [Text] The Cabinet of Ministers press service has 
disseminated a statement to the press that says that the 
government shares the concern over the socioeconomic situation 
in the republic expressed in the statement of the Supreme 
Council of 27 May 1994. At the same time it is emphasized that 
the lack of confidence in the government policy that was 
expressed is unconstitutional--according to the country's Basic 
Law, the Cabinet of Ministers is answerable to the president of 
the republic. 
  In the government it was hoped that the statement from the 
Supreme Council would be a contribution to a constructive 
dialogue between the representative and executive organs of 
power. But, unfortunately, one can see in it signs of slogans 
whose sources lie in the emotions and passions of the recent 
election campaign. 
  With the current socioeconomic situation a painful 
transition 
period is inevitable but the objective preconditions for 
overcoming it are in place, thinks the Cabinet of Ministers. The 
government has acted in compliance with the anticrisis program 
approved by the Supreme Council. Structural transformations in 
the economy are continuing, defense industry enterprises are 
being converted, the nonstate sector is developing, and under 
the conditions of the most severe nonpayment crisis a mutual 
offsetting has been conducted within the republic. Spring field 
work is being completed--under the most difficult of conditions 
the agricultural workers as of today have planted about 15 
million hectares in grain crops and the planting of potatoes and 
vegetables and other crops was conducted at the optimal times. 
  At the present time the government has submitted about 60 
draft laws to the Supreme Council regarding urgent issues of 
economic reform and strengthening the state, legality, and law 
and order in the country. The adoption of these and other 
documents would make it possible to improve the legal base of 
the reforms and make social protection of the population more 
targeted. 
  It says in the statement of the press service that the 
government is inviting the Supreme Soviet to exercise its 
constitutional authority to adopt laws and also to engage in a 
constructive dialogue for the sake of preserving political 
stability and interethnic harmony, and strengthening 
Kazakhstan's prestige in the international arena.

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Andreyev: "The Gordian Knot of the </F>
Legendary Sudzhinbay"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Origins </H5>
  Three territorially isolated groups of clans (zhuz) have 
been 
clearly identified in the structure of the "country of the 
Kazakhs" (and they are partly still noticeable at present): the 
Senior Zhuz (southern Kazakhstan), the Middle Zhuz (the steppe 
central rayons), and the Junior Zhuz (the west of the republic). 
  The history of the emergence of the Russian cities in 
northern Kazakhstan shows that this territory cannot be called 
Slavic in its origins. At the same time, the advocates of 
Russia's historical possession of northern Kazakhstan have their 
own arguments. After falling under the influence of Moscow 
almost a century earlier than its southern oblasts, this region 
was actively settled by Russian colonists, primarily Cossacks. 
But the Kazakh clans bordering with Siberia and the Ural rayons, 
experiencing a continuous threat on the part of the Dzungarian 
Khanate, saw joining Russia as more of an advantageous 
diplomatic step than "a natural desire..." 
  The dissatisfaction with the situation, developing among 
Slavs of northern Kazakhstan, however, is also easily explained. 
Many of them have been living on this land for more than one 
generation, and they see it as a small part of Russia. Finding 
themselves abroad in no time at all, it is difficult for them to 
grasp the argument that several centuries ago the only masters 
here were nomadic clans--the ancestors of the present-day 
Kazakhs. But, it is necessary to understand the latter as well: 
As a result of various kinds of migratory movements and numerous 
"resettlements," the number of aborigines (indigenous people) 
does not exceed 40 percent. But now, after the collapse of the 
USSR, the Kazakhs, perhaps for the first time, have felt 
themselves to be the masters of this very large former Soviet 
republic that is second in size after Russia, and they are 
striving to change the ethnic proportions that are unfavorable 
for themselves. However, as before, the rates of the natural 
growth of the native population remain very low, and the 
"invitations" to countrymen from Mongolia, Iran, and even China 
to return to the aboriginal homeland is also not changing the 
situation. Therefore, one hears the popular slogan on the 
streets of Kazakh cities more and more frequently: "If we cannot 
be increased, then you must be decreased." 
  However, in the opinion of one of the Western correspondents 
in Almaty, "...the local Russians are subordinating themselves 
to the new 'Tatar yoke' with stunning readiness." This 
observation was made, it is true, in the autumn of 1993, and it 
characterized a "special period" in the development of 
Kazakhstan--a "sovereignty euphoria" and a hope for maximum 
"nationalization" as a panacea for all problems. 
<H5>  `Boomerang' </H5>
  In a word, only yesterday considering themselves "vassals of 
Moscow," the Kazakhs in one way or another are trying today to 
"cure" their old national complexes. For, to be a Kazakh is not 
just to have slanting eyes and to speak in one of the Turkic 
languages. Belonging to the people also denotes "participation" 
in thousands of family ties--family and clan that, as before, 
play an essential role, enveloping all of society with invisible 
threads. 
  The Kazakhs succeeded over many years in establishing a 
structure in which belonging to a specific social group right at 
the moment of birth apparently determined the course of future 
life. Dozens of concepts were "established" in the language and 
expressions about mutual relations in the family and the place 
of each in its hierarchy. But, inasmuch as a "taboo" against 
marriages with members of other nations is observed more and 
more of late, the fact becomes apparent of the creation--little 
by little and not hurriedly--of a new, big, and closed clan that 
is functioning on the level of an ethnic group. 
  Not everyone today can even get into a university. And marks 
here do not have any real significance. It is important to be 
"wellborn." One of the main points on a job application 
questionnaire is something akin to the "fifth item." The 
employer, as a rule, does not read beyond this item of the 
submitted questionnaire--education or the possession of specific 
professional skills are secondary "details." 
  ...Without blinking an eye, Tulenbek, a Kazakh lad with whom 
I became acquainted, replied to the question of why he was 
studying history, which he "does not like," that he was "not in 
a position to enroll" in the prestigious juridical department. 
But, he would soon certainly transfer there, for "the family 
promised to help." 
  Knowledge of laws in significant measure was an opportunity 
for him, after defending his diploma and arranging a "cushy 
job," to return the money "invested in it" as quickly as 
possible. Including also not without the help...of bribes. And 
there is nothing surprising in this: "They take" everything. 
Which, however, goes without saying, and it not only does not 
evoke censure, but even the opposite--understanding and respect. 
"Passing through" all of the "vital chains," bribes create their 
own kind of second, unofficial monetary turnover. 
<H5>  Exodus </H5>
  Society was divided distinctly into two groups--"ours" and 
"not ours," the antagonism between which was so strong that the 
elements of communal life were practically obliterated. And, 
although the "Concept of the Sociocultural Development of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan" was published on 1 December 1993, which 
not only noted "the unquestionable priority of Kazakh culture," 
but which also declared a ban on "oppressing citizens on the 
basis of language and the guarantee of a broad space of language 
goodwill"; nevertheless, both the Kazakhs and the Russians are 
now two closed ethnic groups. In addition, they are mutually 
accusing each other: The Kazakhs are accusing the Russians of 
enslavement and the destruction of their eastern culture, and of 
the forced inculcation of pseudo- Europeanization; the Russians 
are accusing the Kazakhs of wildness and an unrestrained 
character. 
  In a word, until now living in peace and harmony, neighbors 
suddenly started "to quarrel with each other." And not only 
through the "fault" of history; propaganda also plays a large 
role. Although no one would probably even pay any particular 
attention to it, if everyone lived more or less tolerably. 
  That is why in certain cases the demonstrative behavior of 
representatives of Russian communities is the result not only of 
"quiet" discrimination against them on the part of local 
authorities, but also of the sharp worsening in the standard of 
living. Especially after the unified "new ruble zone" departed 
this life in October 1993, and, starting on 15 November, the 
Kazakh national monetary unit--the tenge--was introduced. 
  But, it is not only economic necessity that compels Russians 
to leave Kazakhstan (annually, about 100,000 leave just from 
Almaty alone), or, let us say, Germans (300,000 persons out of 
700,000 officially living in Kazakhstan did this in 1993 alone). 
The reasons are far more important. For example, Konstantin 
Erlikh, chairman of the republican society "German Revival" 
(Deutsche Wiedergeburt), also explains the "great exit" with the 
"country's Kazakh fixation," which does not promise national 
minorities a political future. 
  With the adoption of the constitution of 28 January 1992, 
Kazakh was officially declared the state language. Everyone who 
would like to remain in the civil service must now speak Kazakh, 
but there are very few such people among the local Russians and 
Germans. And, as a consequence: In a short time, the number of 
representatives of ethnic minorities was reduced noticeably in 
the management structures and staff of the ministries. For, 
according to the words of a former civil servant from Pavlodar, 
Petr Kranzbueller, a German by nationality, not having 
influential people "of your own kind" at the top, it is 
unbelievably difficult to fight with all-powerful officials in a 
corrupt swamp (we recall Tulenbek) in which God forbid that you 
should utter a "foreign" word. 
  Moreover, up until the end of 1995, every "non-Kazakh" will 
have to declare whether he wants to become a Kazakh citizen or 
not. The one who makes a positive decision to acquire a Kazakh 
passport should take into account that it will then be far more 
difficult to leave the country. The one who makes a negative 
decision will become a person without citizenship in Kazakhstan. 
Germany, it is true, annually authorizes entry for a maximum of 
230,000 persons of German origin from the former USSR (including 
from Kazakhstan). But, simultaneously, Bonn is trying in some 
way to hold back the continuously mounting wave of immigration, 
in particular, by also rendering economic assistance to 
Kazakhstan. Most of all for the development of an infrastructure 
of rayons that are densely populated by Germans. Since 1990, 
about 80 million German Marks have already gone there. 
<H5>  Hope </H5>
  At the same time, national minorities continue to rely on 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who in one of his interviews 
told the press on 4 January 1994 that the departure of every 
person is an economic loss for the republic, assuring that 
"...we do not want to divide our people into ours and theirs. 
Kazakhstan is our common motherland, and it will see to it that 
no one is harmed." Such statements are understandable: The 
republic will hardly be able to do without the Russians and the 
Germans. Thus, according to data from American sources, the 
outflow of just the Russians from Kazakhstan will denote an 
annual loss on the order of $24 billion during the next 
seven-eight years, which inevitably will lead to the actual 
bankruptcy of the republic. The departure of "only" 45,000 
Russians in 1992 was a serious loss for it. Especially if the 
fact is taken into account that a large part of the Russians 
belong to the intelligentsia. But, to develop a new 
professionally trained generation of specialists from the native 
inhabitants cannot be accomplished in a day. Almaty also needs 
the Germans--industrious craftsmen, disciplined workers, and 
hard-working peasants. 
  However, the matter has not gone any further than official 
declarations until now. The assistance being allocated "is 
disappearing" somewhere in the depths of the local bureaucratic 
apparatus. In December of last year, Kristian Keller, a 
professor at Berlin's Humboldt University, told me that the 
Goethe Institute has not been opened in Almaty to this day, 
although the money for it was allocated a long time ago by the 
German side. 
  ...The election on 7 March of this year of a new Kazakh 
parliament, to all appearances, will also not introduce any 
clarity to the question of national minorities. Since most 
likely all of it will be loyal to the president (in the course 
of the election campaign, 20 percent of its staff was actually 
proposed according to "his" list, which roused the censure, in 
particular, of the observers of the CSCE parliamentary assembly) 
then, obviously, it will not be able to adopt the law on dual 
citizenship for the Russians, because Nazarbayev himself is 
against this idea. His words: More than 120 nationalities live 
in the republic, and the priority of just the Russian minority 
alone means an "infringement of the rights of the others." As 
for the elections themselves, their standard, in the opinion of 
the president, corresponded to the "standard of Kazakh 
democracy, which has still not reached the European standard. 
And, therefore, we have to be satisfied with what there is..." 
<H5>  Economic Activity </H5>
  Apparently, the Kazakh economy is also guided by the very 
same "principle." For it stood on losing positions already at 
the time that Stalin created a Union "raw materials appendage" 
out of the republic. All of the minerals mined from the rich 
deposits here went to Russia and to the other republics. 
However, this had no significance in the united, "great state." 
  It is another matter now. It has been calculated that 94 
percent of the commodities being produced in Kazakhstan are 
connected with "Russian middlemen" up to the present time. But 
this "foreign" state is already demanding hard currency for its 
services, and not the ephemeral tenge, but it is exactly the 
former that there is none of in Almaty. However, it also does 
not have its own exits to the sea. And, this means that 
expensive ground transport makes the export of Kazakhstan raw 
material practically unprofitable. 
  In a word, it quickly became clear that one of the main 
symbols of Kazakh independence--the tenge--is only a beautiful 
piece of paper. But "capitalism" is developing in its most wild 
form, in essence being a more modern form of yesterday's 
speculation. Now proudly calling themselves businessmen, 
speculators are driving in splendid cars that are in such 
contrast to their "possessions"--shabby kiosks and booths filled 
with Western "delicacies" (mainly alcohol and sweets) with 
obviously fake firm trademarks. 
<H5>  `Snickerization' </H5>
  And this, however paradoxical it may seem, is yet another 
one 
of the characteristic features of today's Kazakh market. In 
Almaty, for example, it is the practice to "translate" wages 
into "candy bars" that are very popular here: The professor of a 
higher educational institution, in particular, "earns" the 
equivalent of 25, and a chambermaid, the equivalent of 11 
"chocolate sticks..." 
  And, nevertheless, every newcomer here is surprised by the 
practically ubiquitous opinion that "all the same, everything 
will be better," and that "these are only the difficulties of 
the transition period." Although there also are the pessimists 
who maintain that the tenge--the basis of the stability of the 
state-- will already fall this year. That all of Nazarbayev's 
attempts to "create" a Eurasian community are doomed to failure. 
And that, in the final analysis, the Kazakhs on their knees will 
ask Moscow (an example of which is seen in Belarus and 
Tajikistan) for a "new reunification with it." The optimists, of 
course, give a longer period. 
  Meanwhile, the deep stratification of society, galloping 
inflation, scarcity in the market, and, finally, the ethnic 
tension, however, give one and the other more reason to think 
that the question raised recently in the headline of the popular 
Almaty weekly KARAVAN--"Will We Last Until Monday?"--is becoming 
less and less rhetorical. Although, perhaps, the Kazakh Gordian 
knot problem can be solved by the legendary Sudzhinbay, who is 
depicted on the 3-tenge bill, and, in the opinion of informed 
experts, is a direct ancestor of today's Kazakh leader. Who 
knows?

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Konovalov, IZVESTIYA correspondent: "The </F>
Som Is Not Sinking. Why?"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Kyrgyz Currency Has Grown in Importance and Is Helping </H5>
Stabilize the Economy 
  The person with a ruble feels differently today in 
the different republics of the former USSR. With Russian money 
in the pocket, you feel in some places almost like an American 
with dollars who has access to all of the good things and 
commodities. Your purchasing power suddenly turns out to be much 
higher than that of a majority of the people around you... And 
you can exchange rubles practically on every corner. Moreover, 
right here next to you, higher exchange rates will be offered, 
and every respect will be shown to you, but mainly--to your 
money. 
  But then in Bishkek, you immediately notice that your ruble 
is not a bit more respected than the local som, which, 
incidentally, just turned a year old since its birth. Of course, 
there are exchange centers, but in contrast, for example, to 
Kiev, Yerevan, or Baku, they still have to be looked for and, 
indeed, the ruble does not cause a customs hullabaloo here. In 
any case, a som-dollar exchange is much more popular here than a 
som-ruble exchange. 
  When you drop by a store or the market, you understand why 
this is so. There is everything here that there is in Moscow, 
and prices are approximately the same in converting to the 
dollar: Some food products are cheaper; on the other hand, some 
of the imported industrial products are more expensive. But the 
earnings of Bishkek residents in the same conversion are 
somewhat lower on the average than for Muscovites, but not as 
much as in a majority of other republics. But the main thing is 
that the exchange rate of the som and ruble has not changed now 
for many months. 
  It is an evident fact: In contrast to a majority of its CIS 
colleagues, the som does not yield to the ruble--with respect to 
the dollar, their rates of exchange change in parallel. In 
addition, with the lowering rates of inflation recently, the som 
even started to take the lead over its Russian colleague. The 
task was set at the end of this year to bring the rates of 
inflation down to 4-5 percent a month, after the recent 15-17 
percent. However, in the last month the rates of inflation have 
already amounted to 4.9 percent. 
  It is still early to talk about world recognition of Kyrgyz 
currency. But the year-old som has already gained a reputation 
in the post-Soviet space that is quite good. The Moscow banking 
market, where Kyrgyz currency is purchased at a stable rate of 
exchange, also confirms this. But the som looks like quite a 
delicacy on the Central Asian monetary table. The trade turnover 
in this region is rather active, and the som more and more 
confidently is squeezing out its neighbors as the most 
preferable means of mutual settlements. 
  Few could predict such a turn of events a year ago. The 
appearance of the som in the world was met, as the saying goes, 
ambiguously in Kyrgyzstan itself, among its neighbors, and in 
Russia. And there were enough predictions regarding the quick 
crash of the new currency. And, after all, such predictions 
cannot be refuted in logic. But under conditions of the severe 
financial deficit, which is common for all of the republics of 
the former Union, any structure becomes a lobbyist. The sad fate 
of a whole series of other national currencies is known. 
Nevertheless, how was it possible to keep the som afloat? 
  One against all--is the way the position of the 
National Bank of Kyrgyzstan was characterized in the course of 
last year. After all, as is well-known, everyone needs money. 
But under conditions of a very severe financial deficit, which 
is common to all republics of the former Union, any structure 
becomes a lobbyist. But any kind of weakening in 
financial-credit policy is fraught with a jump in inflation, 
which is dangerous for the national currency. It was the task of 
the National Bank, which is granted exceptional powers in 
Kyrgyzstan, to oppose the onslaught of all possible lobbies, 
first of all as the only manager of emissions, credits, and 
regulation of the som exchange rate. 
  The exclusiveness of the position of the bank is in its 
independence from the power structures. Neither the parliament, 
nor the government were able to influence the bank and to 
dictate any kind of decision to it. Of course, a not unimportant 
role is played here by the support of the president who, without 
interfering in the policy of the National Bank, guarded it 
against any pressure. 
  This arrangement of forces is good for the economy, when the 
chief banker is powerful and competent and his team is a match 
for him. This is exactly the way it turned out in Kyrgyzstan. 
Kemelbek Nanayev, the chairman of the board of the National 
Bank, is one of the recognized fathers of the som, a key figure 
for financial and economic reform of the republic in general, 
and also a person with a firm character. Entire legends make the 
rounds here about Nanayev's mutual relations with the branches 
of authority, about the unsuccessful attempts to subordinate it, 
and about the pressure and blackmail on the part of both the 
authorities and lobbying structures. The criterion for him was 
the conformity of the money supply to commodity resources and 
the effectiveness of the programs under which credits were 
issued. But to put it more simply, it was written on the banner 
of the National Bank: Live according to one's means, no matter 
how difficult this turns out to be. 
  It was possible to survive a year. And the results are 
evident. However, a new attack on the bank is now starting, and 
this means on the som and on reforms as well. An attempt is 
being prepared to subordinate the bank to the government at the 
forthcoming session of parliament, and to remove from the bank 
part of the authority to manage currency emissions. 
  What could result from this can be seen from a recent 
scandal, which involved the resignation of the minister of 
finance who instructed that credit be issued from budgetary 
resources to a cousin. If other than bank structures receive 
access to emissions and credits, in essence, the printing press 
will be turned on, and the som will quickly lose its value and 
its reputation, which were earned with such difficulty for a 
year. 
  As for the team that was organized around Nanayev, it, 
perhaps, is one of the most powerful among the central banks of 
the former Union. Over a short period, a large group of 
specialists went through training and a probationary period 
abroad. These are mainly young and broadly educated people who 
work in close contact with very large world banks. 
Specialists-experts of the Central Bank of Japan are now working 
on a project to modernize the banking system of Kyrgyzstan, 
which is calculated for five years and being financed by 
favorable credits of the Japanese Government. 
  Perhaps the competence and independence of the banking 
structure of the republic is a decisive factor in the success of 
the reforms. It is for this reason that a tough policy is 
maintained in financing only directions that are effective, 
promising, and a priority for the economy of the republic. What 
kind are they? 
  These are agriculture and the food industry, light industry, 
the fuel-energy complex, the mining industry, the 
electrotechnical and microelectronics branches, and tourism. As 
President Akayev says, these branches should become the 
locomotive of the development of the economy of Kyrgyzstan. 
  It is amazing for our common usual practice, but Kyrgyzstan 
was able to maintain a 100 percent movement toward priority 
financing for a year. It is also amazing, because this occurred 
under conditions not of a totalitarian, but a rather democratic 
regime. And, judging by everything, the guarantor turned out to 
be the role and personality of President Askar Akayev, which 
have not yet been appreciated for their merits. 
  The president wrote a book, which is already 
typical for our practice as well. However, Akayev stands 
somewhat alone in this. He set forth his ideas about the economy 
of the republic and its prospects. But economics is a new field 
for the scientist-physicist. 
  Akayev's image as a soft democrat oriented on Russia is a 
little deceptive. I ascertained that he was succeeding in 
achieving his objectives by remaining within the framework of 
democracy and not arguing with the other branches of authority 
and political forces. For example, Akayev tried to give the 
Russian language the status of a second state language. It did 
not happen. But he afterwards achieved ratification of a 
constitutional norm that prohibited discrimination against 
people on the basis of not knowing the local language, which is 
being drawn up into laws and denotes, in fact, the very same 
real effect as the recognition of Russian as a second state 
language. 
  It is also the same in the economy. The mutual relations of 
the president with the government and parliament are 
complicated. But the system of laws, decrees, and edicts are 
used by Akayev in such a way that reforms are moving without 
delay, and the most exacting experts from international 
organizations invariably ascertain their dynamism and promise 
and guarantee the effectiveness of Western investments in the 
Kyrgyz economy. 
  It is for this reason that an attack is now being mounted 
against Akayev. The former and current opponents of reform 
understand that only by removing the president will it be 
possible to disrupt the balance that has developed between the 
authoritative structures and to acquire access to favorable 
credits and to the corrupt economic leadership. And so, already 
on behalf of the president, his statements about his alleged 
reluctance to put forth his candidacy for the next term are 
being carried even in the Moscow press. Possible successors are 
also being named. The blow against reforms that is being 
prepared can be ruinous for the economy of the republic. After 
all, the promises of solid financial assistance from abroad are 
based exactly on the present dynamism of reforms. 
  The farmer is feeding himself, the city, and even 
foreign countries, because he became the boss. There were 
11 large collective farms not long ago in Chuiskiy Rayon. Two 
are left now. The rest are individual peasant farms. One of them 
belongs to Dzhusur Suleymenov. He has 200 head of cattle, a full 
assortment of equipment, good earnings, and a permanent channel 
for the sale of products--through state purchases and through 
the market. The state purchases, however, are being reduced 
steadily, and only grain remains, comprising approximately 20 
percent of the production. 
  This kind of dynamic does not intimidate the farmers. The 
market is established. In addition to the fact that the state 
has become concerned about the organization of a network of 
markets and middleman structures, there is also a good outlet 
abroad. Customs restrictions on the export of products have been 
removed from neighbors and Central Asian republics. There 
already are orders and contracts with the far abroad--most of 
all for meat. The Kyrgyz peasant is coming into the world market 
today with his own products. As the same Dzhusur said, the local 
national currency--the som--is quite reliable in these 
operations, and it is preferable to the ruble, in any case. 
  The problem of property in Kyrgyzstan is being resolved for 
the peasants in a rather original way. And it is here, perhaps, 
that the peculiarity of Akayev's approach to complicated 
economic problems revels itself. He insisted on the introduction 
of private property in land. It did not happen. The transfer of 
land for use for 50 years was approved. But a law was just 
approved on the possibility of selling the right to land use. As 
a matter of fact, a market in land is already being established, 
albeit only in a compromise variant. 
  The effect of agrarian reform is evident. There is an 
abundance of products in the markets and in the stores. The 
export of foodstuffs is starting. The farmers are getting on 
their feet and are forming their own capital. And all of 
this--within a year in the introduction of the som and the 
beginning of agrarian reform. 
  So that industry would not go bankrupt, 
unprofitable enterprises are declared insolvent. This process 
has just started, and the implementation of presidential edicts 
and other legislative acts is proceeding under strict control. 
In general, this system of control in Kyrgyzstan is rather 
unique in its effectiveness for the post-Soviet space. This 
practice is especially significant in comparison with the 
Russian discord in legislative differences of opinion where not 
much is coordinated with anything and conforms to anything. 
  To bring edicts, decrees, laws, and constitutional norms 
into 
conformity with one another, and to achieve their implementation 
is what Dzhanysh Rustenbekov, the manager of the president's 
staff, works on 24 hours a day. It is not surprising that he 
also turns out to be a target for the opposition. Accusations 
have already been heard about his participation in corruption, 
but they were not corroborated. However, this is a key element 
in the work to stabilize the som and the economy as a whole; 
therefore, no end of the attacks is in sight. 
  Work is now going on in Akayev's staff on the resolution of 
the republic's most painful problem--the industrial economy. All 
of it has been oriented on the USSR. Practically all of it is 
defense. Now there are two solutions--cooperation with Russia in 
the creation of joint enterprises and in the process of 
bankruptcy. Both processes have started. Enterprises that do not 
show promise are being closed, and contracts are being concluded 
with Russia on the reanimation of unique production. In one and 
the other variant, dramatic turns and a struggle lie ahead. But 
the strength of the som, which is still dynamic and becoming 
more and more weighty, has a decisive significance. What will 
happen further depends not only on the state of the economy, but 
also on the political situation in Kyrgyzstan.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Panfilov: "Negotiations Between Authorities </F>
and Opposition Postponed Again: Through UN Efforts, They Have 
Been Moved to 14 June"] 
  [Text] It had been reported that the second round of 
negotiations between the Tajik Government and the opposition, 
scheduled for 4 June in the capital of Iran, had been moved to 7 
June. INTERFAX reports, however, that according to Anatoliy 
Adamishin, Russia's deputy minister of foreign affairs, the UN 
secretary general's representative, Ambassador Ramiro 
Piris-Ballon, "was a little hasty in announcing this date." In 
Mr. Adamishin's opinion, "he coordinated this date only with the 
opposition and the Iranian authorities. Concurrence has not been 
given by the Tajikistan Government, and we drew Piris-Ballon's 
attention to this fact on several occasions." 
  In one of the latest issues of the Tajik weekly BUZNES I 
POLITIKA, Abdumajid Dostiyev, first deputy chairman of the Tajik 
Supreme Council, said that he considers the first round of 
negotiations in Moscow a success and supports their 
continuation. In this connection, and in order to press on with 
the UN efforts, UN Undersecretary General Marrack Goulding was 
in Dushanbe on 27-28 May and, according to reports from 
Dushanbe, spent many hours in conversations with Emamali 
Rakhmonov, as a result securing the latter's consent to continue 
the negotiations. An agreement was reached that the government 
delegation will arrive in Teheran and the second round will 
begin on 14 June. 
  However, even before the end of Mr. Goulding's visit to 
Dushanbe, Anatoliy Adamishin told an INTERFAX correspondent that 
"the Russian Federation MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] has 
information that there is a plan to bring to the second round of 
inter-Tajik negotiations issues that are bound to result in 
arguments and confrontation rather than reaching an agreement." 
INTERFAX does not elaborate what Mr. Adamishin meant by this, 
although it is known that after the completion of the first 
round both delegations signed the agenda for further 
negotiations, which consist of three sets of issues. Neither 
then, nor now, did either side express any dissatisfaction or 
demanded putting additional issues on the agenda. Moreover, the 
only agreement--on forming a joint commission of 
refugees--already is being implemented. The commission commenced 
its work on 30 May in Moscow under UN sponsorship, and a group 
of government officials arrived from Dushanbe for this purpose. 
  Nevertheless, Mr. Adamishin points out several things in his 
interview. First, the increased number of terrorist acts, in 
which, in the diplomat's opinion, "the opposition also has a 
hand." Second, "in the course of the second round it is 
necessary to sign an agreement on cease-fire and suspension of 
hostile actions, agreement on which had been reached in the 
course of the Moscow round." Strangely, Mr. Adamishin does not 
mention that it was the opposition delegation that proposed to 
sign this agreement, and the government delegation refused. 
Third, he believes that "we need to look into how to bring the 
opposition into the internal political reform being carried out 
in Tajikistan." This does indeed need to be done; however, the 
ban on activities of parties and movements--with the exception 
of the Communist Party and two or three "pocket" parties--is 
still in effect in the republic. Moreover, the government never 
implemented the Law on Amnesty adopted at the Khudzhand session 
in the end of November 1992. 
  As it was in the end of March, when the Moscow round of 
negotiations was in the preparation stage, the "information war" 
already has began in the mass media. Since February, information 
has been coming from Dushanbe--especially from the Tajik MFA 
information department--on preparation of a "major offensive on 
the part of the opposition." Even the date was mentioned--21 
March, immediately after the Navruz holiday. Navruz has passed, 
however, and there was no offensive, while the negotiations did 
begin. By the beginning of the second round, the story with the 
"offensive" was repeated. In addition to the military, Mr. 
Adamishin began to bring up the subject, although it would be 
more logical to discuss the desire or lack thereof to conduct 
negotiations. In a situation of confrontation the position of 
Emamali Rakhmonov is far more advantageous, since he is 
protected by a very combat-capable contingent of the Russian 
Army. For some reason neither military nor diplomats want to see 
the results of the year-and-a-half rule of the regime: an 
economic catastrophe, refugees, and violation of all human 
rights. 
  The latest INTERFAX report from Dushanbe directly 
contradicts 
Mr. Adamishin's contentions. Characterizing the situation on the 
Tajik-Afghan border, Tajik Minister of Foreign Affairs Rashid 
Alimov said that "relative calm has settled there, which is 
partly caused by the overflow of the Pyandzh River, and partly 
by instability in neighboring Afghanistan." The minister also 
reaffirmed the authorities' willingness to continue dialog with 
the opposition. "We have no preconceived notions as to where to 
conduct negotiations. The important part is the substance, not 
location," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent S. Kasatyy: "Attack on Debtors"] </F>
  [Text] The slump in traffic volume is continuing in 
the region serviced by the Volga Railroad. In April for example 
it was 36.7 percent of the level of the corresponding period of 
last year. Noticeably less petroleum products, chemical 
fertilizers, cement and ferrous metals are being presented for 
shipment. Unfortunately a tendency for passenger traffic to 
decrease was noted in January as well. 
  However, as railroad chief Yu. Tsittel noted at a recent 
sorters' conference, there are still considerable unutilized 
reserves in the Volga Railroad. The freight shipment and 
dispatch system leaves something to be desired. Adequate 
attention is not being devoted to freight and passenger train 
schedules. 
  Yuriy Ivanovich also cited the figures for losses from 
failure to meet qualitative indicators. Because of reduced 
locomotive productivity 210 million rubles were lost, almost 
R180 million were lost because the average freight train weight 
target was not met, and R83 million were lost because of too 
high a percentage of empty runs. As for the total, R1.3 million 
were lost. 
  Even today, clients owe the railroad over R75 billion for 
shipments, while it owes R80 billion. Two out of four 
divisions--Yershov and Saratov--are already operating at a loss. 
  Here are two examples of irresponsibility. 
  It took 10 days for car No 63782270 to get from Duplyatka 
Station to the freight recipient in Yelshanka. The railroad 
received R1.235 million from the client in accordance with the 
rate schedule, but it then returned 720,000 to him for late 
delivery--over half of what it earned. And there were no reasons 
for the delays--just the usual laxity. 
  A second example. Passenger cars have been set up at large 
terminals as hotels on wheels. There are some at Astrakhan-1 
Station. An inspection of just one car by financial auditors 
revealed that only 11 of the 19 people spending the night there 
were accounted for. Conductor Koteva pocketed the R28,000 she 
received from the others. And you can imagine how much slips by 
the railroad's cash registers because of hitchhikers in 
passenger and commuter trains! 
  All of this needs to be fought decisively, since otherwise 
the railroad's income will fall no matter what the situation. 
  Special attention is now being devoted on the Volga Railroad 
to reducing operating expenses. Fulfillment of the corresponding 
order of the railroad chief made it possible to save as much as 
over R8 billion since the beginning of the year. 
  But there still are even more reserves. The position of 
division deputy chief for economics was introduced in the 
Volgograd Division, as being the largest and most important, in 
order to concentrate the efforts of financial experts and 
economists. Several months have gone by, but to what end? The 
results are almost invisible. Obviously the railroaders are 
simply waiting for the clients themselves to pay what they owe 
for shipping, out of the goodness of their hearts. And these 
debts are sizeable--64 percent of what the enterprises owe the 
railroad. 
  In a critique at the railroad administration, it was 
revealed 
that the Volgograd Division received from its clients only 40 
percent of what they owe for shipping. This indicator is lower 
than that of the railroad as a whole. In the meantime the 
Yershov Division received over 90 percent in April. How they 
were able to do this will be explained below. 
  Volgograd Division deputy chief for economics V. Sabina and 
financial division chief V. Plyushch were severely rebuked at 
the critique. After this, the owed money began flowing better 
into the division's account. 
  But let's return to the Yershov Division. The aggressive 
position taken by its chief, S. Khlobystov, had the result that 
the most delinquent debtor--the Irgiz Joint-Stock Company in 
Balakovo--finally dipped into its wallet and paid its debt of 
over a billion rubles for transportation services. 
  It should be noted that the experience that has been 
accumulated in settling mutual accounts with clients is also 
proving to be useful. Together with chief economist A. Yelashova 
and financial service chief A. Korolkov, the railroad's 
specialists developed and are successfully using a system under 
which the Volga Railroad pays what it owes for diesel fuel and 
electric power to keep the trains moving with fuel oil obtained 
in turn from its debtors. The Saratovenergo Joint-Stock Company 
recently paid off its entire debt in this way. 
  The railroad's contract relations with clients are also 
growing noticeably stronger. They can now influence them with 
the ruble, by demanding and collecting prepayments for 
shipments. While it owes no debts to the railroad, the Saratov 
Oil Refinery has taken it upon itself to prepay the State 
Committee for Petroleum Products for fuel received by the 
railroad. 
  "We found a way to demand payment of debts through State 
Arbitration," said chief economist L. Yelashova. "As you know, 
the presidential edict on collection of payments without 
acceptance has been invalid for a long time. Now arbitration is 
providing good assistance. Things have only just started moving, 
but our legal service has already joined the effort, and I think 
that the changes accountants and lawyers of the Yershov and 
Saratov divisions have accomplished will very soon become 
possible in all of the railroad's divisions. 
  "For a small fee we use the services of the Saratov Kapital 
Firm, which takes promissory notes from debtors and transfers 
them to us." 
  Debts are also being paid off with commercial products. The 
railroad has received fuel, electric power and construction 
materials worth R31.7 billion from debtors. 
  The way in which these acquired industrial products are 
being 
sold off will be discussed in a separate article.

<F P=106> ["Statute on the Procedure for Selling Off Debtor </F>
Enterprises"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  I. General Provisions </H5>
  1. This statute defines the general procedure for the sale 
of debtor enterprises within the framework of extrajudicial 
procedures with a view to averting the insolvency (bankruptcy) 
of state enterprises and creating the conditions for meeting 
creditors' claims as fully as possible, and it regulates the 
procedure for the sale of any corporate body engaged in 
entrepreneurial activity in respect of which a decision has been 
made, in line with Russian Federation Government Decree No. 498 
of 20 May 1994 "On Certain Measures to Implement Acts of 
Legislation on Insolvency (Bankruptcy)," to deem its 
balance-sheet structure unsatisfactory and the enterprise 
(hereinafter the debtor enterprise) insolvent. 
  2. The sale of debtor enterprises, their assets, and 
state-owned holdings (stakes, shares) of the aforesaid 
enterprises' capital is to be carried out on the basis of a 
decision on their compulsory sale. 
  A decision on compulsory sale may be made: 
  in respect of state-owned debtor enterprises and federally 
owned holdings (stakes, shares) of debtor enterprises' capital 
-- by the Russian Federation State Committee for the Management 
of State Property's Federal Administration for Insolvency 
(Bankruptcy) (hereinafter, the Federal Administration); 
  in respect of debtor enterprises and holdings (stakes, 
shares) of the capital of such enterprises that are state-owned 
by a Russian Federation component -- by the corresponding 
executive organ in the Russian Federation component, and by the 
Federal Administration in the event of the relevant powers being 
delegated to it in respect of the holdings (stakes, shares) of 
the aforesaid enterprises' capital that are state-owned by the 
Russian Federation component. 
  3. The initiative to make the compulsory sale decision can 
come from the Federal Administration, the debtor enterprise, 
creditors holding deferred enterprise bonds, the prosecutor, the 
Russian Federation State Committee for the Management of State 
Property or its territorial agency (on the basis of the results 
of an analysis of enterprises' balance sheets in the course of 
the preparation of privatization documents), other Russian 
Federation ministries and departments, relevant executive organs 
in Russian Federation components, and organs of local 
self-government. 
  4. When the decision is being made to deem enterprises 
insolvent and their balance-sheet structure unsatisfactory, the 
Federal Administration or corresponding Russian Federation 
component executive organ makes a decision on the question of 
dismissing the leader of the debtor enterprise as being unsuited 
to the position held. 
  The de-facto insolvency of an enterprise -- as established 
on 
the basis of the results of an analysis of the financial state 
of the enterprise in accordance with the system of criteria 
ratified by the Russian Federation Government for determining 
whether the balance-sheet structure is unsatisfactory, and 
taking account of the possible repayment of all state debts -- 
is the basis for establishing the leader's responsibility for an 
enterprise's insolvency, as defined by Russian Federation 
Presidential Edict No. 1114 of 2 June 1994 "On the Sale of State 
Debtor Enterprises." For the purposes of the aforesaid analysis 
the results of the possible repayment of all state debts are to 
be evaluated by deducting from the sum total of the amounts owed 
to the enterprise's creditors a sum equal to the payments in 
servicing the state debt calculated on the basis of the amounts 
and due dates of the aforesaid debt, discounted at the Central 
Bank of the Russian Federation interest rate applicable at the 
time the debt was incurred. 
  5. In the event of the enterprise being declared de-facto 
insolvent, taking account of the possible repayment of all state 
debts, the Federal Administration or corresponding Russian 
Federation component executive organ is obliged to adopt a 
decision on the dismissal of the leader of the debtor enterprise 
as being unsuited to the position held and to contract out the 
management of the debtor enterprise -- until it is sold to a new 
owner -- to a corporation (manager) determined with due 
consideration for the opinion of the relevant sectoral ministry 
(department). 
  6. This contract should stipulate: 
  the compulsory coordination with the Federal Administration, 
or corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ, 
of deals concluded on the debtor enterprise's behalf that lead 
to the enterprise's fixed capital being alienated or burdened 
with liabilities; 
  a ban on the use of the debtor enterprise's assets to 
provide 
the incorporation capital of newly established enterprises and 
organizations; 
  the manager's material liability for debts incurred by the 
enterprise after the conclusion of the contract; 
  remuneration for the manager in the amount of the 
remuneration formerly earned by the leader of the debtor 
enterprise, plus a share of the profits earned by the debtor 
enterprise during the management period. 
  Deals done by the manager on the debtor enterprise's behalf 
in violation of the aforesaid coordination procedure are to be 
deemed null and void under the established procedure. 
<H5>  II. The Sale of Debtor Enterprises </H5>
  7. The sale of debtor enterprises while retaining their 
corporate status means the sale of the enterprises' property and 
also, in full measure, the enterprises' property and personal 
nonproperty rights, in accordance with the procedure laid down 
by this statute. 
  The sale of a debtor enterprise is carried out on the basis 
of a decision of the Federal Administration or corresponding 
Russian Federation component executive organ which may be made 
in respect of any debtor enterprises, with the exception of 
enterprises whose privatization is banned under the State 
Program for the Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises 
in the Russian Federation (hereinafter the State Privatization 
Program). 
  8. A debtor enterprise is sold off as a unified property 
complex including fixed capital, other long-term investments 
(including nonmaterial assets), circulating capital and 
financial assets (excluding enterprise property not eligible for 
sale), liabilities, its property rights, its rights to articles 
of industrial and intellectual property, tracts of land and 
other facilities, and its personal nonproperty rights. 
  When a debtor enterprise is sold, it retains the status of a 
corporate body. 
  9. Debtor enterprises' property excluded from their property 
complex during sale include: 
  special-purpose property not eligible for privatization 
under 
Russian Federation legislation on privatization; 
  social and municipal facilities (housing stock, children's 
preschool institutions, and -- by agreement with the 
corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ or 
organs of local self-government -- certain social and municipal 
infrastructure facilities that are vitally important for the 
region in question). 
  When a debtor enterprise is sold, unfinished construction 
projects may also be excluded from its property complex. 
  Special-purpose property not eligible for privatization 
under 
Russian Federation legislation on privatization is transferred 
to the enterprise by a special arrangement that envisages state 
funding and commitments from the parties regarding the operation 
or mothballing of this property. This agreement is an 
inalienable part of the contract of sale. Failure by the state 
to fulfill its state commitments under the agreement ends the 
enterprise's commitments under the agreement, but does not 
constitute grounds for terminating (abrogating) the contract of 
sale. 
  The decision to sell off a debtor enterprise is at the same 
time a decision to transfer social and municipal facilities to 
state ownership by a Russian Federation component or to 
municipal ownership. 
  Unfinished construction projects excluded from the debtor 
enterprise's property complex are to be sold exclusively at 
auction for cash, and up to 50 percent of the funds raised from 
the sale of these facilities is to be remitted to the debtor 
enterprise and may be used exclusively to meet creditors' 
claims. In the event of property being excluded from the 
property complex in the sale of a debtor enterprise, a separate 
balance sheet is drawn up by the Federal Administration or 
corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ. 
  10. The sale of debtor enterprises is transacted by 
commercial or investment tender with no restriction on the type 
[sostav] of bidder. 
  The tender may be conducted through open or sealed bids. 
  11. Any individuals or corporations (including foreign 
corporations) which are not restricted persons, have submitted 
documentation in good time, and have under the established 
procedure paid a deposit (down payment) of 100 percent of the 
opening price of the enterprise are entitled to participate in 
the tender. 
  The responsibility for demonstrating the right to take part 
in the tender and acquire the debtor enterprise lies with the 
purchaser. 
  Restricted persons are: 
  corporate bodies which are not purchasers under Russian 
Federation legislation on privatization, or which are subject to 
restrictions laid down by Russian Federation legislation on the 
maximum size of the block of shares (stakes, holdings) in 
another enterprise to be acquired, owned, or administered, or 
which have an organizational and legal form that does not comply 
with the RSFSR Law "On Enterprises and Entrepreneurial Activity"; 
  in the sale of a debtor enterprise with a dominant position 
in its commodity market -- enterprises operating in the same 
commodity market, as well as corporate bodies and individuals 
controlling their capital in any form or with an opportunity to 
exert decisive influence on their decisions, unless they have 
received the consent of antimonopoly organs to acquire the 
enterprise. 
  In order to participate in a tender, bidders are to submit, 
in addition to the documents laid down by Russian Federation 
legislation on privatization: 
  documents attesting that the bidder is not a restricted 
person (including -- in the event of the debtor enterprise 
having a dominant position in the relevant commodity market -- 
preliminary consent from antimonopoly organs to acquire the 
enterprise); 
  a certificate attesting that a sum not less than 20 percent 
of the debtor enterprise's deferred debt to its creditors minus 
the debtor enterprise's total obligations to the purchaser has 
been deposited in the vendor's account. 
  No requirement for other documents is permitted during the 
application to participate in the tender. 
  12. The following are binding conditions of the tender: 
  the repayment of not less than 20 percent of the debtor 
enterprise's deferred debt to its creditors within no more than 
one month of the conclusion of the contract of sale; 
  a commitment to reorganize the debtor enterprise within a 
month of the conclusion of the contract of sale. 
  The terms of the tender may also include: 
  the continuation of the enterprise's activity in producing 
certain types of goods (work, services) -- exclusively on the 
basis of a petition from antimonopoly organs in the event of the 
debtor enterprise having a dominant position in the 
corresponding commodity market in respect of the aforesaid goods 
(work, services); 
  the preservation of the number of jobs -- exclusively on the 
basis of a petition from the local administration in the event 
of the debtor enterprise constituting a self-contained urban 
unit [yavlyayetsya gradoobrazuyushchim]; 
  the amount of investment in the enterprise. 
  This list of tender conditions is exhaustive; no other 
conditions may be laid down. 
  13. The opening price of the debtor enterprise in the sale 
by tender is determined from figures in the accounting documents 
on the basis of which the Federal Administration adopted the 
decision to deem the enterprise insolvent and its balance-sheet 
structure unsatisfactory. The setting of the opening price for 
the debtor enterprise and consideration of the results of the 
revaluation after 1 January 1992 of the enterprise's fixed 
capital are carried out under the procedure laid down by the 
State Privatization Program. 
  In the event that the opening price set under the aforesaid 
procedure for the debtor enterprise is less than 100 times the 
minimum wage laid down by Russian Federation legislation, the 
opening price for the enterprise shall be set at the equivalent 
of 100 times the minimum wage. 
  14. Tenders are to be held in accordance with the procedure 
laid down by Russian Federation legislation on privatization. 
  In the event of the tender commission receiving a single bid 
that meets the terms of the tender, the debtor enterprise is to 
be sold to the sole bidder at the price bid, taking account of 
the restrictions laid down by this paragraph. 
  If the tender commission receives no bid that meets the 
terms 
of the tender, or if the price of the enterprise in the tender 
falls by more than 30 percent, the tender is declared null and 
void and the debtor enterprise or its property (assets) are sold 
off under the procedure laid down by Section III of this statute. 
  15. A contract of sale is concluded between the vendor and 
the successful bidder (purchaser) on the basis of the results of 
the tender under the procedure laid down by Russian Federation 
legislation on privatization. 
  The vendor is obliged, within three days of the results of 
the tender, to conclude a contract of sale with the purchaser, 
to return the deposited funds to the other bidders, and to use 
the funds deposited by the successful bidder to repay the debtor 
enterprise's deferred debt to all creditors in proportion to the 
sums owed. 
  The ownership title is transferred to the purchaser from the 
moment the contract of sale is concluded. 
  The contract of sale is to be registered with the Russian 
Federal Property Fund within three days of its being submitted. 
  In the event of the acquired enterprise having deferred 
debts 
to its purchaser, this obligation is considered duly discharged 
and is included in the sum total of the debtor enterprise's 
repaid deferred debts to its creditors. 
  16. Funds raised from the sale of debtor enterprises are 
distributed in accordance with Section V of this statute. 
  17. The enterprise is deemed to have been transferred to the 
purchaser from the time the contract of sale is concluded. The 
purchaser acquires all ownership rights stipulated by civil 
legislation in respect of the enterprise. 
  The purchaser is obliged to effect the required legal action 
in reorganizing the debtor enterprise in accordance with Russian 
Federation legislation within a month of the conclusion of the 
contract of sale. 
  18. Decisions on the sale of state-owned debtor enterprises 
whose privatization is restricted are made under the procedure 
laid down by the State Privatization Program for the examination 
of questions of the privatization of facilities and enterprises 
covered by Sections 2.2-2.4 of the State Privatization Program. 
  A sale can only be banned by the Russian Federation 
Government in the case of federal state enterprises covered by 
Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the State Privatization Program, and by 
the corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ 
in the case of state enterprises covered by Section 2.4 of the 
said program, in the event that a decision has been made to 
repay the enterprise's deferred debt to its creditors in the 
form of cash or state short-term bonds (at par) prior to the 
adoption of the decision to ban the sale of the debtor 
enterprise. 
  When restrictions on a sale are laid down in the shape of 
the 
retention of state ownership of blocks of shares, the debtor 
enterprise is transformed into an open-type joint-stock company 
under the procedure laid down by Russian Federation legislation. 
The transfer of state-owned blocks of shares to the 
incorporation capital of holding companies is not permitted; the 
entire remaining non-state-owned block of shares is to be sold 
off under the procedure laid down by Section IV of this statute. 
  The measures linked with the preparation and adoption of the 
decisions indicated in this paragraph are implemented by the 
Federal Administration. 
<H5>  III. Sale of Debtor Enterprises' Property (Assets) </H5>
  19. A liquidated debtor enterprise's property (assets) shall 
be sold in the event that: 
  the tender for the sale of the debtor enterprise is deemed 
null and void, or the results of the tender are annulled, and, 
by agreement with the Russian Federation component executive 
organs which took part in reaching the decision to sell off the 
debtor enterprise, no decision is made to repeat the tender; 
  the sale of the debtor enterprise is deemed inexpedient 
under 
the procedure laid down by Section II of this statute on the 
basis of the results of the analysis of the enterprise's 
financial state carried out by the Federal Administration when 
adopting the decision to deem the enterprise insolvent and its 
balance-sheet structure unsatisfactory. 
  The debtor enterprise's property (assets) are sold on the 
basis of a decision by the Federal Administration or the 
corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ, 
which may be made in respect of any debtor enterprises, with the 
exception of enterprises whose privatization is prohibited under 
the State Privatization Program. 
  20. The decision by the Federal Administration or the 
corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ to 
liquidate a debtor enterprise and sell off its assets is, under 
the established procedure, brought to the attention of the 
enterprise's creditors whose obligations fall due from the 
moment the aforesaid decision is made. 
  If, within 30 days of the creditors being notified, not a 
single notification of disagreement with the decision to 
liquidate the debtor enterprise and sell off its assets has been 
received by the Federal Administration or the corresponding 
Russian Federation component executive organ from creditors 
holding enterprise bonds now due and not covered by the deposit, 
the aforesaid decision is deemed to have been agreed by all 
creditors. 
  If, within the aforesaid period, even a single notification 
of disagreement with the decision to liquidate the debtor 
enterprise is received by the Federal Administration or the 
corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ from 
a creditor holding enterprise bonds now due and not covered by 
the deposit, the procedures envisaged by this section of the 
statute are suspended. In the event of the debtor enterprise 
being federally owned, the Federal Administration, in accordance 
with the powers vested in it, is obliged to take measures to 
apply to the court of arbitration to begin insolvency 
(bankruptcy) proceedings against the enterprise in question. 
  21. The Federal Administration or corresponding Russian 
Federation component executive organ forms a liquidation 
commission to implement the measures to liquidate the debtor 
enterprise. 
  Specialists in anticrisis management, representatives of the 
relevant Russian Federation ministries and departments, 
financial organs, and corresponding Russian Federation component 
executive organs, and other specialists take part in the 
liquidation commission's work. 
  Within a month of its formation the liquidation commission 
submits to the Federal Administration or the corresponding 
Russian Federation component executive organ a plan to liquidate 
the debtor enterprise drawn up in accordance with the standard 
enterprise liquidation plan ratified by the Federal 
Administration. In the event of the liquidation commission not 
submitting a plan for the liquidation of a debtor enterprise 
within the time laid down, the Federal Administration or 
corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ is 
entitled to draw up a liquidation plan independently. 
  The plan to liquidate a debtor enterprise should include: 
  the full name of the enterprise, its legal address, and its 
accounts; 
  information on the size and structure of its assets; 
  information on the financial state of the enterprise and the 
size and structure of its debts; 
  a list of the measures to collect accounts receivable, to 
accept or reject creditors' claims, and to protest deals by the 
enterprise that infringe creditors' interests; 
  a list of social, cultural, municipal, and domestic 
facilities to be transferred to the state ownership of a Russian 
Federation component or to municipal ownership; 
  a list of other enterprise property not for sale, and the 
field in which it is to be used [i napravleniya yego 
ispolzovaniya]; 
  requirements pertaining to dividing up the liquidated 
enterprise's property into lots for sale; 
  the method (methods) of sale of the liquidated enterprise's 
property (property lots), and the opening price; 
  a list of the terms for the sale of the property (property 
lots); 
  a list of the measures to prevent any negative social 
consequences stemming from the enterprise's liquidation; 
  the procedure for effecting transactions with creditors and 
distributing the cash funds remaining after creditors' claims 
have been met. 
  The plan to liquidate a debtor enterprise is to be 
accompanied by the enterprise's balance sheet and by a list of 
creditors indicating the sum total of their claims at the time 
that the decision is made to deem it insolvent and its 
balance-sheet structure unsatisfactory. 
  The dividing up of the liquidated debtor enterprise's 
property into lots for sale is effected in accordance with the 
statute ratified by the Federal Administration on the basis of 
priorities relating to retaining those of the enterprise's 
production structures that manufacture end products that are in 
demand or that have the potential to convert to the production 
of such output. 
  22. The sale of liquidated debtor enterprises' assets 
(property lots) is effected at auctions and commercial or 
investment tenders in accordance with the methods laid down by 
the liquidation plan. 
  Any individuals or corporate bodies (including foreign 
corporations) that are not restricted persons under Paragraph 11 
of this statute and that have submitted the requisite 
documentation in good time and have paid under the established 
procedure a deposit (down payment) of 100 percent of the opening 
price of the property lot are entitled to acquire the assets of 
a liquidated debtor enterprise. 
  Responsibility for demonstrating the right to acquire a 
debtor enterprise's assets rests with the purchaser. 
  The sale of debtor enterprise property lots is effected in 
accordance with the procedures laid down by Russian Federation 
legislation on privatization for the corresponding methods of 
privatization. In effecting the aforesaid sales, the lots to be 
sold cannot be burdened with the liabilities of the liquidated 
debtor enterprise. 
  Assets of a liquidated debtor enterprise that are not sold 
off in accordance with the methods laid down by the liquidation 
plan are to be sold for cash at auction under a procedure 
defined by the liquidation commission, in which case there will 
be no restriction on the price at which the aforesaid property 
can be sold. 
  23. The contract of sale is concluded between vendor and 
purchaser on the basis of the results of the sale of each 
property lot under the procedure laid down by Russian Federation 
legislation on privatization. 
  Ownership title over acquired property lots is transferred 
to 
the purchaser from the moment the contract of sale is concluded. 
  The contract of sale is to be registered by the Russian 
Federal Property Fund within three days of the funds reaching 
the vendor's account. 
  24. Funds raised from the sale of a liquidated debtor 
enterprise's property, as well as funds raised from collecting 
accounts receivable and protesting deals by the debtor 
enterprise that infringe creditors' interests, are placed at the 
disposal of the liquidation commission and, after deduction of 
the funds needed to organize the sale of the enterprise's 
property, are used to implement liquidation measures as well as 
to meet creditors' claims under the procedure laid down by 
Russian Federation legislation. The funds remaining are 
distributed in accordance with Section V of this statute. 
  25. Not later than 15 days from the conclusion of the sale 
of the liquidated debtor enterprise's assets the liquidation 
commission is obliged to submit a liquidation balance sheet to 
the Federal Administration or corresponding Russian Federation 
component executive organ for ratification. 
  The ratified liquidation balance sheet is sent to the 
corresponding enterprise registration organ and constitutes 
sufficient grounds for removing the debtor enterprise from the 
state register. 
<H5>  IV. The Sale of State-Owned Holdings (Stakes, Shares) in </H5>
Debtor Enterprises 
  26. The sale of state-owned holdings (stakes, shares) in the 
capital of debtor enterprises is effected on the basis of 
corresponding decisions by the Federal Administration or the 
corresponding Russian Federation component executive organ in 
the event that: 
  the entire remaining non-state-owned block of shares in an 
open-type joint-stock company formed as a result of the 
transformation of the debtor enterprises in line with Paragraph 
18 of this statute is made available for sale; 
  the hitherto state-owned block of shares of an open-type 
joint-stock company formed in the process of privatization (on 
the basis of a corresponding decision by the organ adopting the 
decision to place the aforesaid block under state ownership) as 
well as unsold blocks of shares in joint-stock companies are 
being sold; 
  the sale of state-owned holdings (stakes, shares) in other 
enteprises is being effected. 
  The rules established by this section of the statute apply 
to 
state-owned holdings (stakes, shares) in the capital of debtor 
enterprises irrespective of the size of the aforesaid holdings. 
  27. In the event that a block of shares in a debtor 
enterprise was placed under state ownership by an earlier 
decision of the relevant organ, it will be liable to reduction 
as follows: 
  when the assigned block of shares comprises over 38 percent 
of the shares, it is to be reduced to 25.5 percent of the 
shares, with all the shares thus freed being sold; 
  when the assigned block of shares is equal to or less than 
38 
percent of the shares, one share out of those assigned is 
converted into a "Golden Share," with all the shares thus freed 
being sold. 
  The decision on the sale of state-owned shares in a debtor 
enterprise terminates the previously established powers of any 
persons involved in managing the state-owned block of shares. 
  In the event that previously state-owned blocks of shares in 
a debtor enterprise were placed in trust, the state 
representative is entitled, according to the established 
procedure, to demand that the trust contract be abrogated and 
the trustee called to account as stipulated by the law and the 
contract, if any one of the factors that led to the enterprise's 
insolvency was the result of unlawful or incompetent action on 
his part. 
  Unsold blocks of shares in joint-stock companies formed in 
the process of privatization, as well as state-owned blocks of 
shares in open-type joint-stock companies, are subject to sale 
in their entirety. 
  28. Holdings (stocks, shares) in the capital of state-owned 
partnerships and open-type joint-stock companies are subject to 
sale in their entirety; in this event the tender participants 
are restricted to persons who have obtained, according to the 
established procedure, the consent of the remaining participants 
in the partnership (company) to acquire the aforementioned 
holding. In the event that a tender is deemed invalid or its 
results annulled, the competent body is entitled to take 
measures to define and apportion of state-owned holdings with 
their subsequent sale under the procedure established by Russian 
Federation legislation on privatization. 
  29. The sale of holdings (stocks, shares) mentioned in 
Section IV of this statute is carried out at an auction 
conducted in line with the procedure established by Russian 
Federation legislation on privatization with due account for the 
requirements of this statute. 
  30. On the basis of the results of the sale of holdings 
(stocks, shares) under the procedure established by Russian 
Federation legislation on privatization, a contract of sale is 
concluded between the seller and the purchaser. 
  Ownership title to the acquisition of the holdings (stocks, 
shares) is transferred to the purchaser from the moment that the 
contract of sale is concluded. 
  31. Funds earned as a result of holding auctions are 
distributed in line with Section V of this statute. 
<H5>  V. Organs Effecting the Sale of Debtor Enterprises. Use of </H5>
Funds From the Sale 
  32. The sale of debtor enterprises, as well as that of 
property (assets) of debtor enterprises being liquidated, is 
effected by the relevant property funds or persons authorized by 
them. 
  33. The sale of holdings (stocks, shares) in debtor 
enterprises is effected by the relevant property funds or 
persons authorized by them. 
  34. Funds from the sale of debtor enterprises, property 
(assets) of debtor enterprises being liquidated, and state-owned 
holdings (stocks, shares) are directed: 
  toward the targeted financing of the maintenance of 
sociocultural facilities of debtor enterprises being transferred 
to the state ownership of the relevant Russian Federation 
component, or into municipal ownership; 
  toward financing measures to revive debtor enterprises and 
avert the negative social effects of bankruptcies, including 
social insurance of workers from debtor enterprises, the 
implementation of measures concerning the crisis management of 
debtor enterprises, and the training of specialists in crisis 
management; 
  to organs guaranteeing and implementing the sale of debtor 
enterprises, their property (assets), and shares (holdings, 
stocks). 
  At least 50 percent of the said funds are to be used for the 
express purpose of financing the maintenance of sociocultural 
facilities. 
  When distributing funds from the sale of unfinished 
construction projects excluded from the property complex of 
debtor enterpries, 50 percent of the funds earned from the sale 
of the said facilities are subject to distribution. 
  The norms for distributing funds earned from the sale of 
debtor enterprises under federal ownership are established by 
the Russian Federation Government. 
  The norms for distributing funds earned form the sale of 
debtor enterprises under the state ownership of Russian 
Federation components are established autonomously by the 
Russian Federation components. 
<H5>  VI. Concluding Provisions </H5>
  35. If, at the time of adopting the decision on the 
compulsory sale of a debtor enterprise which is under federal 
ownership, the case of the insolvency (bankruptcy) of the said 
enterprise is being examined in the court of arbitration, the 
Federal Administraion is obliged to lodge a petition with the 
court of arbitration on the external management of the property 
of the debtor enterprise. 
  In the event that the court of arbitration accepts the 
petition on external management, measures to implement the said 
decision are to be included in the plan for conducting the 
external management of the debtor enterprise's property. 
  36. If proceedings relating to the insolvency (bankruptcy) 
of an enterprise which is under federal ownership are instituted 
after the adoption by the Federal Administration of the decision 
on the compulsory sale of a debtor enterprise, the Federal 
Administration is obliged to lodge a petition with the court of 
arbitration on suspending proceedings relating to the insolvency 
(bankruptcy) of the said enterprise for the period necessary to 
implement the said decision, but no longer than six months. 
  37. If need be, the Russian Federation Government may adopt 
in addition to this statute normative acts on the procedure for 
the sale of debtor enterprises.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Smyk: "Even Metal Cannot Withstand It"] </F>
  [Text] The team of monetarists pushed us into a 
financial and economic crisis and then left. We shall seek to 
resolve it, "that was the way Vladimir Zimovetsk, director of 
the Volga Tube-Rolling Plant, explained the goal of the field 
session of the collegium of Roskommetallurgiya [Russian 
Federation Committee on Metallurgy] which gathered executives of 
the branch, directors of the largest metallurgy enterprises in 
Russia at Staryy Oskol. 
  Today it is more difficult for tube-rolling production 
workers than for others. In five months the sub-branch cut its 
production in half. In ferrous metallurgy the decline continues 
for almost all types of production, while in the case of the 
producers of tungsten concentrate it is particularly significant 
amounting to 74.3 percent. 
  The loss of the domestic market is taking place primarily 
due 
to the lack of an effective demand. But not only because of 
that. The speech by Serafim Afonin, chairman of 
Roskommetallurgiya, for instance, contained the following fact: 
ZIL [Moscow Automobile I. A. Likhachev Plant] and AZLK [Moscow 
Leninist Komsomol Automobile Plant] are in a disastrous 
situation, but the metal-cutting tool containing tungsten and 
molybdenum, however is acquired by them not from the Moscow Hard 
Alloy Combine, but from abroad, and they pay for it with foreign 
currency. Production capacities of tube-rolling plants, built on 
a latch-key basis by foreign firms, stand idle while Russia 
acquires many hundreds of millions of dollars in credit and 
purchases pipes abroad for trunk pipelines. The Tyrnyauz 
Tungsten-Molybdenum Combine has been idled together with the 
Lysvenskiy Metallurgical Plant. 
  Here is a typical example. Import duties were reduced or 
completely eliminated last year on the initiative of 
Roskommetallurgiya. These and other preferential terms gave the 
branch enterprises 500 billion rubles [R]. It was proposed to 
use that for investments. The enterprises, however, invested not 
130 billion as planned but a total of only R15 billion. As a 
result the building of the Yakovlev Mine for the mining of ore 
with a 70 percent iron content and other projects of interest to 
all ferrous metallurgy enterprises was disrupted. 
  Metallurgists understand that if they confine themselves 
within the framework of their branch, they will be unable to 
resolve their problems. They are in the same group with power 
engineers and transportation workers, and it is necessary to 
balance the interests of each link. That can be accomplished if 
one includes another link: the government. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA recently wrote that German railways suffer 
annual losses of seven billion marks. This with distances that 
are insignificant compared to those in Russia and the higher 
level of equipment. The government covers this loss, 
understanding that without such a measure the country would 
simply be losing export income. Russia in particular cannot 
neglect such a measure if we do not want our railroads and ports 
to die out. Already at the present time metallurgical 
enterprises are changing the routes for their freight since for 
many of them Baltic and Ukrainian ports are more advantageous 
than Russian ones. 
  The collegium stressed that the government must at least 
finance investments in power engineering and transportation. 
That measure, first of all, would permit a significant lowering 
of tariffs without freezing, and secondly, funds necessary to 
modernize and lower the cost of these branches would not create 
a burden on the entire economy. 
  A hospital, built for the city by the Staryy Oskol 
Electrometallurgical Plant, was opened on the eve of the 
collegium session at Staryy Oskol. It is a magnificent building 
with modern medical equipment. The city cannot take it over at 
the present time which means the combine will have to operate 
it. With what funds? The metallurgists believe one of the 
solutions to be a lowering of taxes by an amount equivalent to 
expenditures on the maintenance of such facilities. At any rate 
they do not intend shouldering that burden indefinitely. After 
all the metallurgists must include the maintenance of the social 
sphere in the cost of all production and these expenditures 
equal those on wages. 
  Executives in metallurgy worked out a number of concrete 
measures designed to resolve the economic crisis. They are being 
summarized and will be proposed to the government. The decree 
adopted at Staryy Oskol begins with the words: "Having studied 
the economic state of branch enterprises, the Collegium of the 
Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy views it as highly 
critical one."

<F P=106> [Article by Oleksandr Kramarenko, an independent journalist </F>
from Luhansk, supported by: Valeriy Teplyakov, an independent 
journalist from Luhansk; Rayisa Lukyanchuk, chairman of the 
Luhansk Oblast Taras Shevchenko Prosvita Society, member of the 
Writers Union of Ukraine; Ivan Nyzovyy, chairman of the oblast 
organization of the Writers Union of Ukraine; Oleksandr Tykhyy,

Conservative Republican Party [UKRP]; Valentyn Tkalych, chairman

"The Donbass Is Following in Crimea's Footsteps (What the 
Elections to the Supreme Council in Luhansk Oblast Have Shown)"] 
  [Text] The elections of people's deputies in Luhansk Oblast 
were valid in all 25 electoral districts. Deputies were elected 
in 24 of these districts. Sixteen districts were won by KPU 
[Communist Party of Ukraine] candidates, and one was won by a 
candidate of the Socialist Party. These deputies make up nearly 
71 percent of the new delegation to the Supreme Council from 
Luhansk Oblast. This is probably the most decisive leftist 
victory in all of Ukraine. 
  A particularly striking fact is that not a single (!) 
representative of the national-democratic forces opposed the 
Communists in Luhansk Oblast in the second round of elections. 
The national democrats did not place higher than fifth in any 
district in the first round.... 
  What is going on in this eastern oblast of Ukraine, if in 
the 
second round of elections its residents voted only for 
Communists, the party of power, Russian chauvinist imperialists, 
and only infrequently for sharp businessmen from the 
Kuchma-Hrynyov bloc? 
  First and foremost, there are subjective factors at play 
here. Despite the fact that 57 percent of the oblast's residents 
are Ukrainians, in a regional referendum nearly 91 percent voted 
in favor of granting the Russian language official status. If we 
ignore this, in the next Donbass referendum, the same percentage 
will vote for autonomy or secession from Ukraine. 
  This author had the opportunity to take part in the election 
campaign in the oblast's Ukrainian-speaking Lutuhyne Rayon. Even 
there, the absolute majority of the population has a negative 
attitude to Rukh (which personifies the national-democratic bloc 
here). Under the circumstances, what can one expect in the 
several rayons of Luhansk Oblast that are populated by 
indigenous Don Cossacks? 
  Of course, Luhansk Oblast is the Donbass--the "all-Union 
smithy" and the "dormitory of Soviet peoples." But there are 
several such dormitories in Russia. What about the Tyumen 
region, yet we see no evidence of anti-Russian sentiments there. 
  As it turns out, the main reason for the pro-Russian 
sentiments in Luhansk Oblast lies in the influence of the local 
mass media, which are promoting anti-Ukrainian attitudes with no 
opposition from official Kiev to speak of. 
  There are currently six newspapers in Luhansk that can be 
regarded as more or less influential on the oblast level. Three 
of them--LUGANSKAYA PRAVDA, GOLOS DONBASSA, and SUBBOTNIY 
KALEYDOSKOP (all published in Russian)--are vying with one 
another to prove which is most leftist and which loves the lost 
empire of the USSR most. Every issue of each of these newspapers 
carries letters from workers, who blame the Ukrainian 
nationalists in power for all our troubles. 
  The organ of the oblast state administration, NASHA HAZETA 
(the only bilingual newspaper among all of the oblast's 
periodicals), and of the local council, ZHIZN LUGANSKA, can be 
regarded as centrist, making their pages available to all public 
movements and parties. Recently, however, because of the 
economic crisis, they have been showing a distinct preference 
for advocates of the imperial idea, camouflaged either under a 
restored Union or a union of Slavic states. 
  Another newspaper, the organ of the Liberal Party of 
Ukraine, 
VZGLYAD, deliberately avoids political issues, concentrating 
exclusively on purely economic and business matters, and on 
advertising. 
  Interestingly, during the last election campaign, all these 
newspapers gave their main support to the representatives of the 
party of power, with businessmen, chauvinists, and Communists 
taking second place. 
  As far as the rayon newspapers of Luhansk Oblast are 
concerned, Lutuhyne's TRUDOVAYA SLAVA attests that the winds of 
change have not yet reached all the editorial boards. The only 
difference is that now, instead of being dependent on the 
Communist leadership, they are wholly dependent on the party of 
power. Consequently, it is impossible to speak of candidates 
having had equal access to the press in the election campaign. 
Thus, in contrast to the programs of other candidates, the 
programs of all three democratically oriented candidates were 
all published in the same issue. If one were to compare the 
space reserved for their materials in TRUDOVAYA SLAVA with the 
space allotted to the candidates from the party of power, one 
would find the ratio was 1:5. 
  As before, Luhansk Oblast radio sings the praises of the 
working people (mostly the leadership), and therefore, 
obviously, the nomenklatura was much more widely represented on 
the air during the election campaign than provided for by the 
election law. 
  Oblast television is especially apolitical. When it granted 
additional time to the voters [as published], it was for large 
sums of money. Yet the election campaign of the agro-industrial 
nomenklatura was presented against the background of 
preparations for spring field work (in all likelihood with no 
cost to the candidates in question). 
  On the other hand, the Efir-1 commercial television company 
of Luhansk maintains a pro-empire and antistate political 
position, taking full advantage of the silence on this issue on 
the part of both the Luhansk and Kiev authorities. If this is 
democracy, than it is of a unique Ukrainian variety, because it 
is impossible to imagine an antistate channel in England, the 
United States, Germany, France, and so on. 
  In summarizing what has been said above, it is not difficult 
to see that the Luhansk press is generally leftist and 
pro-empire in its orientation and engages in the ideological 
indoctrination of the population in the interests of the 
regional headquarters of the party of power and its 
chauvinistically oriented puppets. 
  The consequences of this state of affairs speak for 
themselves. The overwhelming majority of Luhansk residents 
regards the national-democratic forces as fascists, because the 
local media do not "bother" to explain the difference between 
Nazism and patriotism and are waging a battle against the latter 
as if it were Nazism. 
  It is difficult to overestimate the success of imperialistic 
propaganda. In one of the electoral districts of Luhansk, a 
candidate advanced to the second round of voting who claims that 
the Ukrainian government is made up of Rukh-Banderites and 
states insolently in his autobiography that in addition to 
Russian, he is fluent in English, Polish, and Italian with the 
help of a dictionary.... 
  The question arises: What should we do? Anything but what 
the 
leaders of national-democratic forces do when they occasionally 
pay courtesy visits to the Donbass. Evidence of this 
"productive" activity is seen in the fact that the overwhelming 
majority of the population of Luhansk Oblast honestly believes 
to this day that V. Chornovil and L. Lukyanenko are criminal 
offenders, despite the tolerant conduct of these politicians 
during their visits. 
  In my opinion, if the Donbass is to remain Ukrainian, there 
is an immediate need to establish a network of Ukrainian mass 
media in the region, whose goal would be to combat the 
anti-Ukrainian propaganda of the local media and to foster a 
civic consciousness among the residents of this coal mining 
region to replace the "Soviet-Communist" [sovkova] mentality 
that reigns here now. 
  It is especially important to create the necessary 
conditions 
in Luhansk Oblast for the publication of a bilingual weekly with 
a circulation of no less than 50,000. This matter should be 
decided in Kiev, and not in Luhansk, where the necessary funds 
are not available. 
  It does not really matter who in Kiev assumes the 
responsibility of financing such a newspaper. But if the 
government refuses to do so, this will serve as perfect proof of 
its concern for the territorial integrity of Ukraine in real 
terms. If the national-democratic forces refuse, this will be 
proof of their conscious capitulation to communist-chauvinism in 
the Donbass. 
  Bilingualism in the Donbass is a necessity today, because 
for 
the past three decades, Ukrainian schools in the region have 
constituted a tiny percentage as against Russian-language 
institutions. This is one aspect. Another is that I can confirm 
as an author that my Ukrainian-language articles on patriotic 
themes elicit no response from my political opponents, in 
contrast to my articles in Russian. 
  Another reason why such a newspaper is needed in Luhansk is 
that the city has a creative potential to make this a leading 
publication in the oblast. If the newspaper becomes a reality, 
knowing the creative potential of Luhansk's independent and 
democratically oriented journalists, I can almost guarantee this. 
  First of all, we will draw the population's attention with a 
series of materials exposing instances of "grabitization" in the 
oblast. This is something that is not reported by any medium of 
mass information in Luhansk Oblast. 
  Secondly, we will become the most popular newspaper because 
we will publish analytical articles on political, economic, 
artistic, and sports subjects. The weekly will need several 
months to accomplish this. By thus winning the respect of our 
readers, we will be able to deal a serious blow to 
communist-chauvinistic propaganda in Luhansk and throughout the 
entire oblast. 
  Such a publication, though expensive, is the cheapest means 
by which to prevent the Donbass from following the example of 
Crimea, which is already costing Ukraine much more than it would 
have cost to create a full-fledged alternative network of mass 
media on the peninsula (when this was still possible). 
  Thus, the preservation of the territorial integrity of the 
country is unquestionably a national matter. It is time to move 
from words to deeds. That is, of course, if our statesmen are 
not merely playing at statehood and using this as camouflage for 
something quite different.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Andreyeva from Lvov, under the rubric </F>
"Point of View": "Better With Plyushch to a Kolkhoz Than With 
Kuchma to Russia"] 
  [Text] The number of signatures collected in the Lvov 
region for candidates for president makes it possible to 
determine the preliminary apportionment of sympathies in the 
western region. 
  Even V. Babin, who did not collect the necessary number of 
signatures in Ukraine overall, acquired about 2,500 supporters 
in Lvov Oblast. This figure, of course, relates sooner to a 
curious incident, and it only indicates the "multifaceted 
nature" of the politicized region. But there are the signed 
lists filled out in support of the serious aspirants to the 
highest post in the state that make it possible to draw certain 
conclusions. 
  Leonid Kravchuk is leading. A total of 51,748 signatures in 
an oblast in which V. Chornovil, the No. 1 rival to the 
president, took the unequivocal lead in previous elections in a 
nationally oriented oblast in which the "streamlined" policy of 
yesterday's Communist Party secretary never aroused enthusiasm. 
This is an important result. Behind him is the work of the 
National Rukh of Ukraine [NRU]. The NRU, perhaps, was the only 
organization in Lvov that collected signatures in its 
headquarters, without shunning newspaper photographers who 
recorded those who approached the tables to witness support for 
the former president. The NRU, naturally, worked on the 
instructions of its head--Larisa Skorik. And here we again 
return to a paradox: The organization that started with lumpen 
superradicalism and the rejection of any existing authority, 
being "dominated" by the Kravchuk "Amazon," became pro- 
presidential... 
  The rest of the organizations were collecting signatures as 
if in secret from themselves according to the principle--the 
right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. But how 
can it be otherwise? Rukh, for example, adopted a number of 
statements about the unfeasibility of presidential elections in 
June, but meanwhile it was secretly collecting signatures for 
aspirants I. Plyushch and V. Lanovoy. For this reason, there is 
no one to ask--why for two candidates? Quite a few were 
collected in Lvov for Plyushch-- 20,669. The methods were 
diverse. For example, the signature lists were distributed to 
the chairmen of the branch trade unions. The head of the oblast 
trade union committee is People's Deputy Yaroslav Kendzor. On 
this basis, it can be said unequivocally: The support for 
Plyushch was the position of the Rukh leadership. 
  Ya. Kendzor put it this way: "Everyone who thinks about the 
future of Ukraine should vote for the candidate who will be able 
to take the biggest number of votes from Kuchma. L. Kuchma's 
pro-Russian position does not have any substantial support in 
the Galicia region (objectively: 2,686 signatures compared to 
second place in Ukraine as a whole). When Leonid Kravchuk 
visited Lvov on Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs business, he was met by pickets with slogans, 
among which there was a rather rude one: "Get your military 
overcoat, and go back to where you came from!" However, 
attraction to the "older brother" not only does not please those 
who are distinguished by their emotional simplicity, the 
picketers, but also the more undecided politicians. The question 
lies elsewhere-- what will it be possible for the various 
sovereign forces deployed in the West to place in opposition to 
Kuchma's high national Ukrainian rating? After all, the problem 
is that they are already very diverse. If we start with the 
extremists, S. Khmara simply scolded the NRU for supporting 
Kravchuk, but, on the other hand, he called V. Lanovoy an 
"anti-Ukrainian force." L. Skorik's people will fight 
desperately against Kuchma, using the Galicia beachhead. But 
they simultaneously will also start to ruin Ivan Stepanovich 
and, however, everything that will originate from Chornovil's 
Rukh. 
  Many here regret that V. Pynzenyk removed his candidacy and 
that Chornovil did not move forward. At this time there is no 
figure on the horizon of the presidential elections who for the 
Galicians would be thoroughly theirs. This is probably not that 
bad on an all-Ukrainian scale: Western Ukraine cannot win the 
elections on the whole numerically, and possibly in this way its 
votes in this case will favor a more or less acceptable 
candidate? 
  According to preliminary feelings, the democrat-centrists of 
Western Ukraine are inclined to the candidacy of I. Plyushch not 
because they are so enthusiastic about it, but because half a 
loaf is better than no bread. It is worth quoting the words of 
M. Kosyv in this respect: "Of course, if someone wants to see 
something in the head of state who even slightly resembles the 
Crown Prince of Wales in manners, then the problem will be 
difficult. What is Plyushch--he even uses crude words... But, 
after all, it will be necessary to choose not between the good 
and the best, but between the bad and the utterly bad..." 
  It is a pity, of course, that this is the case. As for the 
quality of the elections--who will become the new president of 
Ukraine will depend in many ways on Western Ukraine, which is 
politicized and always active in elections. If it is taken into 
account that neither Kuchma, nor Moroz (2,494 signatures) have 
any success here, then drawing the Galician card becomes even 
more interesting for the rest of the aspirants.

<F P=106> [Article by Borys Perhamenshchyk: "Metropolitan Filaret: </F>
'Whose Purpose Does This Falsehood Serve?'"] 
  [Text] Most Blessed Metropolitan Filaret--one of the 
leaders of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kiev 
Patriarchate--received me at his residence, which is situated in 
a three-storey building at 36 Pushkin Street in our capital. 
  Our discussion touched upon the refutation by the UOC-KP 
[Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kiev Patriarchate] of a report 
published in the Ukrainian business journal NOOSFERA. The text 
of this report has been widely disseminated by the mass media. 
It was obtained--as indicated--"from a source close to 
government circles." The gist of this published item lies in the 
statement that on 14 May of this year V. Kryzhanivskiy, 
Ukraine's ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the 
Russian Federation, had a meeting with Aleksiy II, Patriarch of 
Moscow and All Russia. Discussed at this meeting was the 
granting of autocephaly to the UOC-KP, as well as the secret 
meeting between Metropolitan Filaret and the leader of the 
Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan 
Vladimir (Sabodan). At this meeting agreement was allegedly 
reached concerning the unification of both Orthodox branches 
into a single, integrated confession. In the opinion of a 
"reliable source," the leader of the UOC-MP [Ukrainian Orthodox 
Church-Moscow Patriarchate] would have to become the patriarch 
of the newly unified church. 
  Here is what my fellow-conversationalist, Filaret, stated on 
this score. "It is not true. Some persons would like me to have 
a personal meeting with Metropolitan Vladimir (Sabodan), but 
there was no such meeting. Nor could such a meeting take place 
behind the back of the patriarch of Kiev and All Russia-Ukraine. 
Such disinformation by no means stabilizes the coordinated work 
of both hierarchies, but--on the contrary--leads to dissension 
and discord. Whose purpose does this falsehood serve?"

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Zholdak, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA: "Ukraine Is </F>
Bankrupt, but There Is a Ray of Hope. A Change of Power in the 
Supreme Council--the Socialist Oleksandr Moroz Has Been Elected 
Chairman. UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Predicts: Out of Seven Candidates 
for the Post of President of Ukraine, the Democrat-Centrist Ivan 
Plyushch Will Win"] 
  [Text] We might say that the election of a new chairman of 
the Supreme Council has become the first stage of the logical 
completion of a well-known and extremely important decision of 
the old membership of parliament, namely: 
  1) to hold an early election of people's deputies; 
  2) to hold an early election of the president of 
Ukraine. 
  So the first point has been "carried out," and thank God, 
quite successfully. For anyone who thinks normally "early 
elections" mean a radical change in the personalities in power 
both in the parliament and in presidential structures, which 
have shown their inability to govern the state and ensure at the 
very least the regular physiological existence for their nation. 
The membership of the parliament has been changed perceptibly. A 
new chairman also appeared promptly. 
  By now, Ukraine has been driven into the ground. At present, 
Ukraine is bankrupt. I had heard this before, but prior to the 
publication of this article, I decided to ascertain this with my 
own eyes. My good friend Volodymyr Nykonenko, chairman of the 
Druzhba kolkhoz, who is boundlessly devoted to the land and the 
people who work it, succeeded in "shaking loose" 800 million 
karbovantsy to finish the construction of gas mains in the 
villages of his farm. The poor Nykonenko has been working on 
that gas for many years. He suddenly called me and asked me to 
find out when the money had "gone" to Poltava, to the oblast 
agricultural administration (incidentally, his kolkhoz in this 
oblast, in Chernukhinskiy Rayon, subscribes to 10 copies of 
UKRAYINSKA HAZETA--therefore, it is a collective activist of our 
Subscriber Club). I went to the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Foodstuffs of Ukraine. I found the Administration for Investment 
Management, and their executives told me: 
  "You are going to wait for a long time. The quota assigned 
for capital construction in Poltava Oblast is 106 billion 
karbovantsy, whereas only 2 percent has been received by the 
oblast. That is it! The Ministry of Finance does not have the 
money." 
  "When will they remit the rest?" 
  "We do not know. At any rate, not soon." 
  "Are they withholding it solely from Poltava Oblast?" 
  ""All oblasts are in this condition. In total, rural areas 
are supposed to receive 5.8 trillion karbovantsy for capital 
construction. The Ministry of Finance has allocated 2.8 percent." 
  "That is it?" 
  "Besides, the shortfall for last year is 1 trillion." 
  I was indignant: "This is how the Ministry of Finance 
operates--Pyatachenko is hoarding it." 
  "For a long time now, he has not had things to hoard. There 
are no withholdings for the budget. There are no sources of 
revenue. Production is at a standstill. Ukraine is bankrupt." 
  I had heard the terrible official word. Ukraine is bankrupt! 
Later, I met Minister of Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko in the 
Supreme Council and told him this. He silently threw up his 
hands. 
  "Write down your considerations about everything as it is, 
Hryhoriy Oleksandrovych. Let us raise the alarm. Let us tell the 
people the truth about who has driven Ukraine into the ground." 
  "I will try to write this, but not now--in a couple of 
weeks." 
  I did not ask him again, because I understood that he would 
have no time two weeks later, either. In today's issue of our 
newspaper, we print an article by Volodymyr Chernyak--a 
diagnosis of disease or perhaps.... No, I will not write the 
word "death." Ukraine is bankrupt, but it is alive. It should be 
rescued immediately. We should look for those who can do 
it--soon, as soon as possible! 
  One change of power, in the Supreme Council, has already 
occurred. I believe that Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch acted wisely 
in refusing to take part in the election of the new chairman of 
the Supreme Council. I will repeat that the revolutionary 
decision on early elections is not a doorbell but an entire 
gong, telling all the current "leaders" that they should vacate 
their long-held seats of power for other "leaders" and deputies. 
UKRAYINSKA HAZETA has already written this, but I will repeat 
again that more reasonable and sober figures have come together 
in the current parliament. It is true. 
  The new chairman was elected on Thursday, 18 May, in the 
first round. Oleksandr Moroz, a well-known and quite active 
modern politician, the chief of the political council of the 
Socialist Party, became chairman (perhaps out of fear, HOLOS 
UKRAYINY immediately used "political council" with the capital 
letters, as was once the case with the Politburo. To be sure, 
there was a basis for that, because in his speech, Mr. Moroz 
frightened the newspaper-organ of the Supreme Council, stating, 
to my mind incorrectly, that HOLOS UKRAYINY should offer 
information about the positions of the deputies rather than give 
the thoughts of a journalist concerning the position of a 
deputy. This was a great mistake by the chairman, because if a 
newspaper does not evaluate the positions of deputies and the 
chairman, it will be bathroom tissue rather than a newspaper). 
  This is why I was doubly concerned when Mr. Moroz was 
elected 
chairman: I did not like his communist-censorship leanings; 
second, more than his "socialist affiliation," I was worried 
about the people milling around him and surrounding him because, 
now his most authoritative comrades in arms and like-minded 
people will want to receive leadership portfolios from him. God 
forbid, Mr. Chairman may yield to the pressure of "the kin and 
relations" without distinction. This is generally dangerous in 
politics. It is good if the contenders have a place for God in 
their hearts--for Love for our poor people, who have suffered in 
the darkness of communism, and will intelligently search for 
ways other than the well-known way of Lenin. Even now my hands 
tremble at the very thought that we might be governed by, say, 
these two so-called Ukrainians, one of whom, with the last name 
ending in "enko," courageously demonstrates his disregard for 
the native tongue of our people and for their statehood. 
  Terror overcomes us also because many people from among the 
new deputies, apparently highly educated and intelligent people, 
deliberately and impudently "speak only the foreign language" 
[the phrase in quotation marks is given in Russian in the 
original]. Indeed, Russian is a foreign language in Ukraine 
because it is not the state language. This is why it is 
considered foreign, just as French, Polish, German, or English 
are. I mean the official language in state institutions, to say 
nothing of the chamber of the Supreme Council. 
  To be sure, I have some expectations that the new chairman, 
who, incidentally, knows Ukrainian and has a "B-plus" command of 
it, will tactfully and unceremoniously force each deputy to 
respect the Language Law (anti-Ukrainian figures specifically 
have to be forced). For its part, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA will provide 
lessons in the state language with assistance from the language 
commentator Oleksandr Ponomariv, a professor of the imeni Taras 
Shevchenko Kiev University and one of the best experts on the 
Ukrainian language; the newspaper will also name the names of 
those who spit upon this language in the supreme premises of 
power. 
  So it would be greatly disturbing if the closest comrade in 
arms of the new chairman, the October Socialist Mr. Marchenko (a 
Ukrainian in form, an alien in content) "ends up among the 
engineers on the steam locomotive" [the phrase in quotation 
marks given in Russian in the original], which is pulling 
Ukraine to the "station" [the phrase in quotation marks given in 
Russian in the original] of Independence. We are only afraid 
about this station turning out to be the "commune-station." [the 
phrase in quotation marks given in Russian in the original], or 
that the former people's deputy Mr. Kotsyuba (in the past, a 
comrade in arms of the Rukh people and now one of the leaders of 
the Communist Party of Ukraine) can claim a "supreme post." He 
can say: "Oleksandr Oleksandrovych, we, the Communists, have 
pushed you through to become chairman; give me the portfolio of 
a minister or deputy minister, or say an ambassador to Europe, 
to Paris!" The gentleman Communist Marmazov does not bring us 
spiritual peace and joy. So far, the behavior of Petro Symonenko 
(number one in the Communist Party of Ukraine) has been changing 
the previous negative attitude toward him because it turns out 
that he has a good and easy command of the state language 
(meanwhile, the notion was advertised that the "leader" 
recognizes only Russian); nor is he an enemy of privatization, 
of precisely the kind that does not rob the people; he is also 
in favor of a market economy; he is supposedly altogether not in 
favor of the former USSR (a few days ago, he stated in the press 
in a quite human manner that "we are in favor of a Union of 
states with equal rights, although we understand that this is a 
protracted process, too"). 
  It is possible that Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz will not 
act as, for example, Mr. Shcherbytskyy in his time; the latter 
is no longer known to young people but is greatly respected by 
our current president of Ukraine as a "prominent politician" 
[the phrase in quotation marks given in Russian in the original] 
(see and read the so-called sensational interview on 21 May in 
KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI)--he dragged along to Kiev his "great" 
fellow natives from his Dnepropetrovsk. Why do I say "possible" 
with regard to Mr. Moroz? Because on the first day of his reign 
he showed himself not to be stubborn and, as he stated in his 
"throne" speech, truly capable of looking for ways to 
consolidate various forces rather than fanning the flames of 
confrontation and sicking some people on others. 
  The issue of electing the first deputy of the chairman of 
the 
Supreme Council became the first test of his wisdom. Mr. Moroz 
and apparently the forces that stood behind him proposed 
Chairman of the Peasant Party Oleksandr Tkachenko as candidate. 
He is an undisguised Communist, just as the staunch prominent 
poet of Ukraine Borys Oliynyk. Naturally, Tkachenko has 
contributed greatly to the victory of Oleksandr Moroz. In 
general, Oleksandr Tkachenko, 54, is an uncomplicated person (he 
is undoubtedly a committed and wholehearted Ukrainian) and a 
somewhat tragic one (he was minister of agriculture and deputy 
prime minister; at the same time, certain highly placed persons 
in power used him--they tossed him, as a camouflage outfit, to 
be a candidate for the post of president of Ukraine in order to 
attract votes away from Rukh and Republican candidates, and 
later forced him to pull out for the benefit of another "party 
comrade"; however, this ended up in his dismissal from his job 
altogether, and for a period of time he looked for a vacant 
position on his own). Now he is a figure of some consequence 
among the agrarians. So the rightist forces in the parliament 
(there are fewer of them than there are Communists) lodged a 
resolute protest against Mr. Tkachenko. This was right. The 
chairman is a Socialist, and his right-hand man would have also 
been from the legions of the left. This turns out to be somewhat 
disproportionate. The meeting of the Supreme Council was 
frustrated, and the chairman went on to further consider the 
situation with the factions and parties. 
  Naturally, only the deputies know this "nitty-gritty" 
better. 
I called our political commentator and co-chairman of the 
Statehood faction, Academician Ihor Yukhnovskyy, to find out 
whether power had been ultimately transferred to 
Socialist-Communists and if we could announce "a silent 
Communist coup." 
  The good friend of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA told us: "Do not worry. 
Ukraine will continue to be reborn as an independent, 
self-reliant, democratic state." 
  "So has Moroz not been stubborn? Is he keeping his word 
about 
consolidation?" 
  "We will see." 
  "Whose candidacy have they settled on now?" 
  "Perhaps it will be Yuriy Ivanovych Kostenko. However, let 
us 
survive till Tuesday." 
  Our conversation took place on Friday, 20 May. We survived 
until Tuesday. Oleksandr Tkachenko, the leader of the Peasant 
Party, was elected first deputy chairman, and Oleh Dyomin, a 
nonparty member, was elected deputy. They were members of an 
alternative pair, which got the greatest number of votes from 
among those proposed by all factions of the Supreme Council. It 
was as a result of the victory of these candidates that a 
stormy, even hostile debate was held last Wednesday. The 
rightist forces justifiably attacked the leftists, and the 
latter justifiably accused the rightists. The chairman spoke to 
make a comment. Who was right? Both. Understandably, squabbles 
in the parliament will, unfortunately, continue until all 
leaders understand that now we should fight for the immediate 
resolution of the most acute economic problems rather than for 
political victories. Ukraine is in danger now. 
  It is being pushed toward this at the last moment by 
imperial 
forces, in particular those of Russia. UKRAYINSKA HAZETA will 
discuss Oleksandr Tkachenko and Oleh Dyomin separately. 
  Who is who? Oleksandr Moroz has just turned 50. This is a 
golden age for a politician. He was born in the village of Buda, 
Tarashchanskiy Rayon, Kiev Oblast. He grew up in a family with 
many children. Moroz received a higher education at the 
Ukrainian Agricultural Academy. He is a mechanical engineer. 
Moroz also graduated from the Higher Party School of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. He worked in his 
profession for 12 years. Later, he was on the staff of the Kiev 
Oblast Committee of the party. He has been a people's deputy 
since 18 March 1990. Moroz was elected and reelected in the 
Tarashchanskiy Election District. He is married and has two 
daughters and four grandchildren. According to my observations, 
none other than Ivan Plyushch discovered him as a politician, or 
more precisely, promoted him in the Supreme Soviet, while at the 
same time breaking through to the supreme level of power 
himself. Actually, previously they had worked in the same Kiev 
Oblast and in the same area, that of agriculture, as leaders: 
Ivan Plyushch as chairman of the oblast executive committee, and 
Oleksandr Moroz as chief of the agrarian department of the 
oblast committee of the party. In the past, both were 
Communists, leaders of the Communist Party. The spirit of these 
times of building the "bright future" [the phrase in quotation 
marks given in Russian in the original] has faded. At present, 
based on their words and deeds, both wish to build an 
independent Ukraine, the Ukrainian state. 
  One of them, the younger one, has risen to the top of 
supreme 
power in Ukraine. The other, who is three years older, has 
already been there. It is not feasible to blame him for the 
mistakes of the Supreme Council, because this was the first 
parliament that, in its Communist vestments, proclaimed to the 
entire world the Ukrainian state, which was finally independent 
of all unions and the "great Soviet family" [the phrase in 
quotation marks given in Russian in the original]. So the 
Supreme Council deserved the early election, and, together with 
it, its chairman during this period of transition, and I would 
say, an unsteady period in which all of us got a breath of the 
air of freedom which it appeared would never break through the 
misanthropic Communist regime (in a matter of speaking, 
everything was being done for the people, and in reality the 
people felt like prisoners both in run-of-the mill jobs and in 
high positions). Both Moroz and Plyushch, as well as all 
nomenklatura apparatchiks, know full well how they had to be 
servile rather than serve, fake sincerity, and pretend to be 
zealots of the great bright ideas. As a personality, one could 
not come into his own self. Even those who occupied the apex of 
power (I mean on the scale of Ukraine) were in awe of Moscow, 
feared dismissal, and spoke the "truth" correctly, as Moscow 
wanted it. Then what can we say about the practices within the 
republic? They were as Shevchenko wrote--the large beats up on 
the small. 
  Everything that happened in the Supreme Council is for the 
better. For example, I like the fact that Mr. Moroz knows by 
heart and quotes from Taras Shevchenko. The bad people, the 
foes, the nonpatriots of Ukraine do not know and do not wish to 
know our Great Poet. 
  I like the fact that Mr. Moroz wants himself, us, and his 
grandchildren (I hope, Ukrainians) to live in their independent 
state. He put it well after his election as chairman: The people 
should feel themselves free in a free state. However, to this 
end a truly free state should be built up so that the people 
will not live as they do now, anxious and alarmed day and night 
and contemptuous of work, their way of life, and their highly 
placed bosses. 
  Could our past and present leaders be loved and respected, 
given that they have brought the Ukrainian people to the point 
where-- 78 percent of the people are below the poverty 
line; 
  20 percent of the people barely make ends meet; 
  and only 2 percent live so as not to deny themselves 
anything? 
  These terrifying facts (this may not exist in any country of 
the world) were given in his presentation by a new people's 
deputy of Ukraine, Professor Mykhaylo Pavlovskyy, a candidate 
for the position of chairman of the Supreme Council (he later 
withdrew his candidacy). His professional profound discourse 
about the critical economic position of Ukraine and at the same 
time realistic proposals for its breaking through toward the 
light will be published by UKRAYINSKA HAZETA in the next issue. 
In conjunction with this, we would like to quote the words of 
the new chairman of the Supreme Council to the effect that "we 
should urgently engage in forming the government.... We should 
not be geared toward the election of the president." If these 
are not words but rather a serious plan of action, there is no 
need to look far and wide for a real prime minister (rather than 
an "acting" one, which has suited the president of Ukraine for 
such a long time). He is Mykhaylo Pavlovskyy, 55. There should 
be no fears about his belonging to the Ukrainian Republican 
Party. If he agrees to become a member of the government, he 
will suspend his party affiliation. This is what Ukraine needs. 
New, fresh forces are needed, which are competent, reasonable, 
and businesslike. There are rumors that Vitaliy Masol is 
"wanted" for prime minister. He is from yesterday. He is a 
Shcherbytskyy cadre from the times of the Soviet period of 
stagnation. His command of Ukrainian is poor. Besides, he is 
retired. 
  In the next issue we will discuss the potential and chances 
of some of the registered candidates for the post of president 
of Ukraine. Out of 11 contenders, the four random and minor ones 
were left out. Those are instructors at two colleges in 
Kiev--the notorious Larisa Skoryk, and Mykola Rud, who is known 
only at work and at home, as well as the former people's deputy 
and engineer from Kharkov Ivan Valenya, and Viktor Pynzenyk (the 
most intelligent one among them, a quite prominent economist). 
What did they count on? Do they really not have a feeling that 
they will become a laughingstock among their acquaintances 
rather than chiefs of state? 
  Even among the ultimately designated seven, only two stand 
on 
really solid ground. 
  Leonid KRAVCHUK. He has already had an opportunity 
to prove that he was capable of changing the life of the people 
for the better. He has not changed it. On the contrary, 
everybody has been getting worse off all the time. It is 
doubtful that he will win. It is better for him to live 
gracefully on his own. 
  Leonid KUCHMA. He has already had an opportunity 
(an even greater one than Leonid Kravchuk) to show that he is 
capable of bettering the life of the Ukrainian people. On the 
contrary, he has tried to scare the Ukrainian people that it 
would get worse if we do not unite with Russia. He could not 
stand the strain and submitted his resignation. He stood at the 
helm of the government for 11 months. He now desires a higher 
seat.... It is not any easier there. Besides, he does not know 
the Ukrainian language properly, and that language does not 
enjoy his particular sympathy. 
  Volodymyr LANOVYY. As a deputy prime minister, he 
has already had an opportunity to prove that he is capable of 
developing and introducing an effective economic program. 
However, he talks much and promises a lot. Prior to his coming 
to politics, his working language in the Institute of Economics 
was Russian only, and it is now difficult for him to speak 
Ukrainian. However, his main drawback lies in the fact that by 
nature he is not an energetic, persistent politician. He 
represents the type of an experienced scientist who feels best 
in the reading room among his scientist colleagues. 
  Oleksandr MOROZ. Now he already has the rank of 
Supreme Council chairman. However, he still remains a candidate 
for the post of president--for now. It appears to me that Mr. 
Moroz will withdraw his candidacy, because there are several 
substantive reasons to do so. First, real politicians do not 
grasp all to lose all, and do not hold the two highest positions 
in the country. This is the greater scheme of things. The 
Socialist Moroz won in a chamber in which more than one-half out 
of 336 voters were his supporters, whereas in the "chamber" of 
Ukraine, with millions of voters opposed to the Communist 
system, he will indisputably fail to get the necessary number of 
votes at present, despite the successful election of Communists 
to the Supreme Council. Now is not their time, if there ever 
will be such. I am certain that Oleksandr Moroz understands this 
full well and wants to work as chairman more than anything else. 
He knows what needs to be done. If Plyushch becomes president on 
top of this, they will move mountains. 
  Valeriy BABYCH. We can only welcome him for his 
courage in wanting to become president of Ukraine. Without a 
political image, almost unknown among the peasants, workers, and 
also the intelligentsia, he, the chief of the Ukrainian Finance 
Group (few people are really knowledgeable about this 
organization, either), came to the start line. Evidently, he is 
merely trying the "princely crown" on for size because he is 
very young, or else he is on a "diversionary" mission. It is 
hard for him to speak Ukrainian. I ascertained this during a 
chance conversation with him at the palace of our president. I 
have heard that he is a top-notch financier. However, at present 
Ukraine needs a wise and reasonable politician-president. 
  Petro TALANCHUK. He is the minister of education 
of Ukraine, 56. As early as in October of last year, UKRAYINSKA 
HAZETA predicted that he would be one of the real candidates for 
president of Ukraine. This has been the case. He is a professor, 
doctor of technical sciences, and president of the Academy of 
Engineering Sciences. He graduated from the Technical University 
of Kiev and became the rector of this college. He is a great 
patriot of Ukraine, a highly cultured individual whose knowledge 
of science and production is profound. He deserves to become 
president of Ukraine, but he is not very popular with the people 
as a politician. We will publish a more detailed story about him 
in the next issue. 
  Ivan PLYUSHCH. He is 53. Plyushch is widely known 
and respected by the common people and the intelligentsia. He is 
energetic, persistent, and principled (he did not support L. 
Kravchuk's position on the issues of the Black Sea Fleet; he has 
his own, different view of the economic union and the CIS, 
believing that economic agreements with individual states are 
sufficient). This is how some new people's deputies dubbed 
Plyushch: "He was a firm director of the Supreme Council." 
  Is it good or bad? If we consider that Mr. Plyushch always 
got the decision he wanted, he is a terrible man. However, if 
all of the decisions he "pushed through" are aimed solely at 
protecting the interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, if 
these decisions make Ukraine strong and its people happy, I 
would want to advance two new "deputy-style" slogans, but this 
time on a greater scale: 
  "People, let us elect Ivan Plyushch director of Ukraine!" 
  "Long live Director of Ukraine Ivan Plyushch! He is the one 
we need now--the second president of the independent Ukrainian 
state." 
  I have arranged with Ivan Stepanovych to publish in the next 
issue a article entitled "Ivan Stepanovych Is Never Angry" about 
such "directorship in Ukraine" and generally about the everyday 
life of just People's Deputy Ivan Plyushch. 
  I will recall that the election of the president will be 
held 
on 26 June. It will definitely be held. It cannot be postponed 
by any means. Oleksandr Moroz said very correctly from the 
rostrum of the Supreme Council that political agitation on 
account of the election of the president of Ukraine cannot be 
fueled. The rampage of governmental mafia structures is 
continuing; the undisguised plundering of the people is under 
way. 
  Elections are needed. A new president is needed. A new 
government consisting of Ukrainian patriots is needed. One 
deputy prime minister already intends to resign. No, nobody 
should be dismissed. Everybody, beginning with the president, 
the acting prime minister, and deputy ministers, must come to 
the rostrum of the Supreme Council, report on the operation of 
the Cabinet of Ministers, and give an account of who has made 
our people into beggars before the deputies and all honorable 
people. It is hard to understand why our president 
simultaneously comes out against the election of the president 
in his voice while using his hand to write a petition concerning 
his desire to fight for this position. In submitting himself to 
a new popular vote, the president should know that the people 
are happy with his previous reign. In this case, he will be 
victorious. Meanwhile, in our country 78 percent of the 
people do not know what they are going to eat tomorrow....

<F P=106> [Roundtable discussion at the editorial office of HOLOS </F>
UKRAYINY, moderated by HOLOS UKRAYINY editor in chief Serhiy 
Pravdenko and prepared for publication by L. Kokhanets, A. 
Kraslyanskyy, and V. Tuhluk, with the participation of Supreme 
Council deputies Yevhen Marmazov (Communist Party), Volodymyr 
Mukhin (Socialist Party), Oles Lavrynovych (Rukh), Mykhaylo 
Ratushnyy (Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists), Pavlo Movchan 
and Stepan Volkovetskyy (the Statehood deputy group), and Yevhen 
Zherebetskyy, Hryhoriy Omelchenko, and Anatoliy Yermak (the 
Reform deputy group); statements by V. Mukhin and Ye. Marmazov 
are printed in Russian: "Roundtable Discussion at HOLOS 
UKRAYINY. We Are Held Together by the Main Point: The Fate of 
Ukraine, the Fate of Our People"] 
  [Text] Elections in the spring of this year were 
complicated and tense. If nothing else, the fact that but a 
handful succeeded in "breaking through" to the Supreme Council 
on the first try indicates this. Nonetheless, the election was 
held despite everything. The people made their political choice 
by clearly saying that they attach hopes to the Ukrainian 
parliament. At the same time, during the election campaign the 
people demanded that certain unfavorable elements in the 
operation of the supreme legislative organ be abandoned, that 
its operations be greatly improved, and that the coefficient of 
its effectiveness be raised. 
  So the editorial office invited for a "roundtable 
discussion" 
representatives of various political forces, deputy groups, and 
factions of the Supreme Council in order to share their thoughts 
about the following questions: 
  1. What is your vision of the process of improving the 
operation of the Supreme Council? To your mind, what aspects of 
its prior operation should be rejected and what aspects should 
be borrowed? 
  2. Deputy factions as a new element of the structure of 
the Supreme Council--will they become an instrument of accord in 
the parliament or, on the contrary, aggravate a political 
confrontation? What is your projection? 
  3. Do your parties and factions have a clear-cut vision 
of how Ukraine is to overcome the economic crisis? What priority 
draft laws will you introduce for consideration by the Supreme 
Council to this end? 
  4. The Supreme Council and its newspaper. 
  The following took part in the conversation: Yevhen 
Marmazov (Communist Party), Volodymyr Mukhin 
(Socialist Party), Oles Lavrynovych (Rukh), 
Mykhaylo Ratushnyy (Congress of Ukrainian 
Nationalists), Pavlo Movchan and Stepan 
Volkovetskyy (the Statehood deputy group), and Yevhen 
Zherebetskyy, Hryhoriy Omelchenko, and Anatoliy 
Yermak (the Reform deputy group). 
  The "roundtable discussion" was moderated by Serhiy 
Pravdenko, editor in chief of HOLOS UKRAYINY. 
<H5>  "We Have Come To Work Rather Than Fight" </H5>
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Observers estimate that even the first week 
of operation of the Supreme Council was considerably more 
productive than with the old set of deputies. They have 
succeeded in taking care of the initial organizational problems 
and proceeded toward resolving the main issues. The deputies 
have actually rejected political controversy and the settling of 
accounts, and have devoted their entire time solely to what is 
the most important. Nonetheless, the process of improving the 
operation of the Supreme Council still calls for major efforts. 
What is your view of this? 
  [P. Movchan] I would like to note the following essential 
aspect to begin with. It is yet another illusion that the 
current Supreme Council has come in, formed itself, and will 
quickly solve the problems that we are facing. We should not 
encourage among the public the illusion that the current Supreme 
Council will set things right all at once and will neatly 
resolve everything. We should get rid of these illusions, 
because they facilitate a new period for the accumulation of 
negative energy, which may end in an assault on the Supreme 
Council--the way it began in previous years. To me, it is 
unimportant whether this might come from the west, the south, or 
the east. 
  It should be understood that the period of collapse that 
Ukraine is going through will not end all that soon. Ours was 
not a Ukrainian economy, it was a colonial economy; as a matter 
of fact, it has to be built anew. All hopes that the Supreme 
Council will come and announce that a union with Russia begins 
today, and everything will become marvelous right away is a 
political speculation. Thus, a great, very strenuous effort 
awaits us. 
  The best way to ensure this, to have no speculation in this 
chamber, may be to split into factions, which we are already 
doing. Ensuring minority rights is yet another essential aspect. 
At present, there are various colorings in the 
chamber--blue-and-yellow, Red, or some other, but this is not 
important. It is important that without ensuring the 
constitutional rights of the minority in this Supreme Council, 
we will not get rid of strictly political precedents. Therefore, 
we need to make relevant amendments as soon as possible and lay 
a legal foundation for the functioning of groups that represent 
the minority in the parliament. 
  [H. Omelchenko] I represent the Reform deputy group, which 
was established on the initiative of a group of 
deputies--officers, lawyers, and economists. I subscribe to a 
number of fundamental statements just made by People's Deputy 
Movchan. However, to my mind, global problems also exist at 
present along with this. First of all, it is carrying out 
economic reforms that would make it possible to improve the life 
of the people and offer an outlook--as the saying goes, the 
light at the end of the tunnel. The second is the adoption of 
the legislative base and the creation of an entire system of 
state organs that could genuinely fight corruption and organized 
crime. As I see it, in the process there should not even be a 
discussion of whether or not Ukraine is to be an independent 
state. The Ukrainian people have made their choice, and there 
may not be any political unions at the expense of independence. 
  [Ye. Marmazov] [statement printed in Ukrainian] We should 
approve clear-cut by-laws and strictly adhere to them in order 
to improve the work of the Supreme Council. Unfortunately, our 
by-laws were violated all the time, even the provisional 
by-laws, which were passed last year. This is the first point. 
Second, we should make sure that our Supreme Council works, that 
a person comes along who would organize the operation of 
factions, groups, and circles. It should not so happen that a 
leader of the Supreme Council pursues his policy contrary to the 
will of deputies. All people's deputies should work, no matter 
how different they might be. The task at hand is to get the 
maximum from everyone in order promptly to pass laws aimed at 
overcoming the catastrophe that Ukraine is now facing. 
  In the old Supreme Council, nobody was interested in how 
commissions operate and whether someone reports for work or not. 
We should now categorically reject such practices. It was indeed 
possible to work through the commissions, through the 
territorial groups of deputies. However, not even attempts at 
that were apparent. 
  At present, we have an extremely difficult situation. There 
will be work for everyone, just come join in. The operation of 
the Supreme Council should be organized in such a way that 
everyone without exception would work on a permanent basis. One 
submitted a petition when he ran for deputy; let him now quit 
his previous job. Tell me honestly: Did we frequently see 
Zvyahilskyy and other leaders at the sessions? At present, too, 
the minister of agriculture, his two deputies, and the chief of 
material and technical supplies are deputies. Are they really 
going to sit here? If 50 people fail to show up for a session, 
the parliament will be paralyzed. Everybody should work on a 
professional basis. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Could it be that these difficulties would 
be 
successfully overcome if the leaders of factions work 
efficiently, if there is professional agreement and solidarity? 
  [Ye. Zherebetskyy] I, for one, am very happy that comrade 
Communists agree that the parliament must be professional. 
Frankly, all of us were afraid that the leftist blocs would 
advocate something different. 
  I would like to second the thought of Pavlo Movchan that the 
minority in the parliament should enjoy clearly specified 
rights. In recent years, the actual structuring of society has 
occurred; consequently, it is all the more necessary for the 
parliament to have its own new structures. 
  At present, there is the center, the right, and the left, 
but 
they are not structured among themselves. To be sure, as I see 
it, a parity between them has already been reached, and this is 
very important in itself. Preparatory groups operated very 
productively before the session began. They proposed regulations 
on factions which we passed and which suited everybody. This 
indicates that all of us wish to work productively. 
<H5>  By-Laws Are Not a Luxury, but Rather the Rules of the Game </H5>
  [O. Lavrynovych]I worked in the group that considered the 
draft by-laws. It is a pleasure now to hear a favorable 
evaluation of our effort from a deputy colleague. Of course, the 
effectiveness of operation of the Supreme Council depends on the 
rules of the game that it adopts. On several occasions, I worked 
with the representative of the Communist Party in this group and 
rejoiced at finding a common ground on procedural issues. This 
is the case, first of all, with the developed clear-cut rules of 
behavior of each people's deputy and all parliamentary organs at 
the time of decision-making. Therefore, the regulations that we 
have adopted are the first step for the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine to acquire a civilized appearance in general and to 
complete its structuring into factions and deputy groups in 
particular; this is precisely the process that can and must give 
us an opportunity to work much more effectively than before. 
  These conditions must first of all make our society feel 
that 
the deputies are responsible for the laws that they pass, and 
that there are political forces that assume responsibility for 
the decisions that they will make within these walls. 
  [V. Mukhin] I took part in the work of the preparatory 
group. 
At the first stage, we tried to lay a foundation for the normal 
operation of the Supreme Council. To this end, the idea of the 
need for clear-cut structuring was proposed because the fact 
that the previous Supreme Council was essentially a nonparty one 
was its substantial drawback. Although they frequently refer to 
the "group of 239," life has shown that individuals who actually 
adhered to particular party policies were few and far between in 
this group. Everybody else amounted to an indefinite political 
force and voted on each occasion, whichever way he saw fit. This 
made it impossible to clearly structure operations, due to which 
they discussed issues for hours and days, without being able to 
arrive at a common decision. 
  If someone followed attentively the first day of operation 
of 
the current parliament, he noticed that within just a few 
minutes, we plowed through issues that the former Supreme 
Council would have discussed for an entire day. The idea of 
clear-cut structuring is bearing fruit. 
  This issue simply ties in to the issue of factions. The 
Supreme Council will be at a political impasse forever in the 
absence of factions, in the absence of clear-cut political 
divisions. The situation is very simple: If they succeed in 
quickly coming to a compromise among the leadership of the 
factions, a compromise among all deputies will be found 
automatically. For this reason, when the question [rendered in 
Ukrainian in the original] "Are the factions of deputies a path 
toward accord?" I will confirm that this is indeed a path toward 
a precise and clear understanding of what we want, after all. I 
think that there will not be harsh confrontations between 
factions--we are going to come to agreements. 
  [M. Ratushnyy] I would like to revisit the thought with 
which 
P. Movchan began. Indeed, the several days of operation of the 
Supreme Council make it possible to draw certain favorable 
conclusions. However, it bothers me that the agreement of the 
deputies to quit their previous position only until 1 July has 
gone unnoticed (perhaps deliberately unnoticed). This means that 
some deputies do not want to just be deputies but also to remain 
directors or heads of oblast councils. They still want actually 
to influence elections to local councils, and I think that such 
a trend is dangerous. 
  What else may improve the operation of the Supreme Council? 
To my mind, it would be the existence of strong executive power 
in Ukraine, paradoxical as this might be, because until such 
exists, it will be impossible to carry out the adopted laws. 
Effectiveness of our actions is out of the question in the 
absence of this. Rules of the game were mentioned here. We cheat 
one another all the time. I worked in the working group for the 
development of by-laws. We made great efforts to provide a 
greater opportunity for one or several deputies to somehow show 
initiative and fully partake of the process of law creation. The 
leader should improve the work of the Supreme Council and mainly 
prevent it from rolling back. All differences that may be 
eliminated in the Supreme Council, be they on tactical or some 
other grounds, may be resolved if the goal of the parliament is 
the same: to prevent the liquidation of Ukrainian independence. 
If other trends prevail, this Supreme Council is not worth 
talking about.... 
  [S. Volkovetskyy] To my mind, the role of the speaker is to 
designate the middle, or the idea on which the Supreme Council 
agrees. Finding this idea is not all that easy, because it may 
not become apparent for everyone right away. A certain mastery, 
even the talent for advocating this position, is necessary. Of 
course, the speaker, just like any people's deputy, is entitled 
to his own point of view on all issues, but he has a special 
role to play. He must find an optimal solution on which the 
entire parliament would agree. 
  What we have adopted cannot yet be called good by-laws: This 
is a temporary move in order to ensure the further operation of 
the Supreme Council. In all parliaments of the world, their 
chairmen do not have the extensive rights that our previous 
chairman had formally or informally (I have studied these 
issues). Of course, attempts will be made to extend these rights 
further. This should not be the case. The chairman should be 
restricted through by-laws, and may allow himself only the 
things that the by-laws allow. Each deputy should know his 
rights, know what he can and cannot do, including deputies that 
constitute the minority, whether or not they belong to factions. 
  If we discuss what practices of the old Supreme Council it 
would be worthwhile to reject, I think that it is first of all 
poor discipline and, once again, the excessive role of the 
chairman. How many cases do we remember in which deputies did 
not speak to the point, but were not stopped! In keeping with 
the by-laws, they should have been resolutely interrupted: This 
would have taught a good lesson to other deputies, they would 
have made decisions faster. The endeavor would have gained, and 
their authority among the people would have been greater. Who 
from among these deputies was punished? There had to be some 
kind of sanctions, but we did not see anything like that. Also, 
there were altogether impermissible things, such as voting in 
place of someone else. 
  Generally, I believe that we, the new membership of the 
Supreme Council, should raise our operations to a new level, 
taking into account the experience of foreign partners. 
  [A. Yermak] I think that a rigid confrontation between 
political parties, circles, and structures will hamper the work 
of the parliament. This will not benefit the state of Ukraine. 
This is why I would like representatives of various parties and 
movements to agree on a moratorium on political discussions from 
the very first days, at least for a certain period of time, 
until we improve economic conditions. Political debate in the 
parliament will bring about still greater polarization of 
society, and you know that it is quite perceptible to begin 
with. The people just will not endure all of this. Our regular, 
harmonious work will provide an opportunity to complete the 
election to a full-fledged parliament. If there is accord 
between the representatives of various parties and movements, 
the right, the left, and the center will be able to make a 
determination and agree to focus their efforts on economic 
issues, on fighting corruption and the mafia, but on the 
condition of grasping that all of us are working for the same 
independent Ukraine. This is the foundation of foundations, the 
cornerstone. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] I ask that those who wish to do so respond 
to the second question: "Deputy factions as a new element in the 
structure of the Supreme Council." They may not be an entirely 
new element; an attempt to create them was made in the previous 
parliament, too, when it was divided into the majority and the 
minority, but later all of this fell apart. Therefore, will 
factions become an instrument of accord in the parliament? Your 
projection? 
  [P. Movchan] Whether there will be accord in the parliament 
will depend on how the statehood forces act. If all of these 
forces work for the same cause, the state, accord will always be 
reached. If we once again encounter anti-statehood forces, a 
conflict cannot be avoided. However, it is understood that 
anti-statehood forces will propose all manner of unions, and 
this will bring about the resuscitation of the old Union. 
  There are very powerful forces in Russia that speak out for 
the restoration of the Union. It is no secret that such forces 
also exist here. You witnessed yourselves a demonstration with 
the requisite slogans on Khreshchatyk. These are the hidden 
explosives that could split the parliament and cause a split in 
our state itself. All of these economic programs (I have read 
them and am familiar with them) further the resuscitation of 
colonies, and this is the path of provocations and clashes, 
which would begin here and transcend the confines of the 
parliament. It is precisely for this reason that amendments 
should be made to the Constitution right now, including those 
concerning the powers of the Supreme Council chairman, on which 
Volkovetskyy has touched: The speaker is not the chairman. The 
speaker is a regimented individual; if these amendments pass, it 
would be desirable to already make proposals as to the functions 
of the Supreme Council chairman. Relevant amendments should be 
made to the Law on the Chairman, and the head of the parliament 
should be elected later. As far as we are concerned, we are 
doing everything the other way around. 
  The programs of the center-right and the center are 
absolutely identical. The left is an exception. Perhaps they 
used this as a move in the elections, but now have other 
approaches and their own vision. The fate of the parliament will 
depend on these programs: accord or discord, controversy or 
agreement. One more point--amendments should be made to the 
by-laws in order to ensure the rights of both the minority and 
the majority: They should be codified. If this is not done, 
conflicts are also possible. 
  Do you know what the previous Supreme Council was to blame 
for? For there being neither a majority nor minority law. So 
they could not agree. I support the idea of Anatoliy Vasilyovych 
Yermak about the introduction of a moratorium, but on the topic 
of independence of Ukraine rather than on political discussions. 
If we agree that we do not touch on or consider this problem, we 
will always find a common point of view on economic aspects. 
<H5>  The Ideas May Be Different, But the Goal the Same </H5>
  [Ye. Marmazov] We believe that the creation of factions is a 
step forward in the operation of the Supreme Council. In 
principle, factions can play a major role in achieving "accord" 
[word rendered in Ukrainian in the original] in the operation of 
the Supreme Council. This "accord" will come when factions work 
in the way which is outlined in the by-laws. We are now taking 
measures for our faction to become constructive and disciplined. 
I like it very much that the by-laws provide for the 
"conciliatory group of deputies" [phrase rendered in Ukrainian 
in the original] to which a major role is assigned. If we keep 
to all of this, there will be "accord" [rendered in Ukrainian in 
the original] in our parliament. As far as "statehood" [word 
rendered in Ukrainian in the original] is concerned, the program 
of our Communist Party, incidentally, as well as that of the 
Socialist Party, clearly says that we support the policy of 
building a sovereign, independent Ukraine. We have a clear-cut 
platform, which we have released to the public, and everyone 
knows this. This is not a maneuver, as Pavlo Movchan said; it is 
our position. However, whether someone likes it or not, we 
should boldly proceed to establish an economic union. How can it 
be viewed? The European Union is now being created in Europe, 
which is proceeding toward just one monetary unit, the ECU 
[European Currency Unit]. If we take this path, in the long run 
there should also be a common unit, and so on. 
  [G. Omelchenko] I hope that deputy factions and deputy 
groups 
offer a real chance to achieve a compromise on the most readily 
solvable problems. The parliamentary practice of the world is 
unimaginable without the activities of factions, but this same 
practice is also inconceivable without elections on a multiparty 
basis. Therefore, if we are to be completely logical, factions 
indeed would play the role they do in developed countries if we 
held elections on a multiparty basis. Alas.... One more point. 
The parliamentary majority may take advantage of its numerical 
preponderance and demand the adoption of solutions to which the 
minority will not agree. So if these demands fit within the 
confines of parliamentary culture and of the possible upholding 
of minority rights, work will be constructive. 
  [M. Ratushnyy] I agree. We could refer to a favorable role 
of 
party factions only in the event that an election has been held 
on a multiparty basis. More than 180 deputies of the current 
Supreme Council are nonparty members. This is more than 
one-half. Therefore, it is feasible to refer to groups rather 
than factions. Three such groups have already emerged. The first 
group draws those who clearly advocate the restoration of the 
colonial status of Ukraine in some new forms. This group 
includes approximately one-third of the deputies. The second 
group, which clearly advocates statehood positions, has already 
emerged: They are also a conventional one-third. The third group 
likewise accounts for one-third. They are those who make a 
determination depending upon the situation. Consequently, the 
danger of changing the rules while the game is in progress 
exists. At present, someone wants to splinter these groups into 
some kind of factions and manipulate these small, 25-strong, 
party factions, to haggle, promise, and actually stage the 
entire behind-the-scenes performance. I am already seeing how a 
"hunt" is beginning for certain independent deputies. They try 
to drive these deputies into some kind of trap, whereas the 
deputies run toward the center, because there an opportunity 
exists to stand closer to power. They see that the leftists are 
getting the upper hand; therefore, they should flee from the 
center in that direction. This is precisely why the factions, 
due to their fuzziness, will not clearly reflect the reality 
that exists in our society. If there is no accord on any terms, 
this will amount to suicide for the parliament. The very 
instinct of survival, of self-preservation, should force us to 
come to an agreement: "Guys, let us work constructively; 
otherwise we will waste time, and the people will start asking 
questions as early as the fall...." 
  [O. Lavrynovych] Let us hope for this. I also think that 
associations of deputy groups and factions the possible 
existence of which is envisioned precisely by the provisions of 
by-laws will play a great "peacemaking" role. The unification of 
these factions and deputy groups will occur precisely in keeping 
with the principles to which, incidentally, Mr. Ratushnyy 
referred, perhaps with corrections of some kind. I would like to 
see a majority that would amount to an association of deputy 
groups and factions to appear as soon as possible, so that we 
could clearly know who belongs to the majority, who forms the 
government, and who precisely is politically accountable for the 
things that are done in this chamber. 
  I would like a common-sense group, a pro-reform group, a 
group for establishing legal order in our society, to be formed 
as soon as possible. This would make it possible to reconcile 
all opposing sides and to not make enemies of one another, but 
to cooperate and make the most urgent decisions. Why does nobody 
want to say that, in essence, there are two factions in this 
parliament: one in favor of statehood, independence, and 
sovereignty in full, and the other in favor of economic unions 
that ultimately mean the restoration of the empire. It is 
possible to talk about this in various ways, but it should be 
clearly understood what is what in reality. You do know that 
Zvyahilskyy is giving the Lisichansk Oil Combine to Russia 
toward the debt. Therefore, there is an attempt at present to 
liquidate our sovereignty by way of economics. Here is the 
"struggle for an independent Ukraine but within an economic 
union" for you. 
<H5>  Let Us Start With the Main Link--the Economy </H5>
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] So, do you see a way out of the economic 
crisis, and what draft laws to this end will you propose to the 
Supreme Council for consideration in the immediate future? 
  [Ye. Marmazov] Proceeding from the platform of our party, 
we, 
the Communist deputies, firmly advocate the social choice of the 
sociopolitical system. We are not abandoning this, and we are 
convinced that this is the only way to go. We advocate the 
primacy of all people's state property in politics and 
economics. This is why I consider creating conditions for the 
regular operation of state enterprises and collective farms to 
be the main point. It is on them that our entire economy hinges. 
However, virtually no attention has been paid to these 
components lately: We have been left to our own devices. 
  Ukraine will not be fed by either private farmers or joint 
ventures; all of this will not come to pass soon. It is also 
necessary to pass first of all a number of laws, in particular 
those on putting the finance and credit policy in order. 
Generally, we have an absolute mess in this area. The economy 
has now been paralyzed because the finance and credit system has 
been messed up. 
  Hence our paralysis. Such a situation has now developed that 
in our country enterprises and sectors cannot settle among 
themselves. The absence of the money supply is one of the 
burning issues. Something else: I support the comrades in that a 
major, carefully developed law on fighting corruption, mafia 
structures, speculation, and bribery should now be developed. 
Omelchenko has raised this issue. By now, the supreme spheres 
here have been afflicted with corruption; how are we going to 
put things in order? Take a look: It is not houses but rather 
palaces that are being built in the vicinity of Kiev. This is 
how arrogant people have become while taking advantage of 
impunity. Even the president's advisers did not refrain from 
this--they have also been involved with the mafia. One has run 
away, another has come to take his place, and has started doing 
the same thing. So, has corruption been elevated to the status 
of policy here? 
  [G. Omelchenko] Long ago. 
  [Ye. Marmazov] The following issue, although not everyone 
likes it: We will have to put everything aside and proceed to do 
the thing that is advantageous to Ukraine--establish an economic 
union. In the absence of it, we will not be able to restore 
normalcy in the operation of the national economy of Ukraine. 
Sooner or later we will proceed to do it anyway, but without 
encroaching upon sovereignty and an independent policy. 
  [G. Omelchenko] What needs to be done in order to overcome 
the economic crisis? First of all, the tax system needs to be 
changed urgently. Manufacturers must pay 30 percent in taxes at 
the most. It is possible to introduce a nominal tax of 5-7 
percent for five years. Further on, strict order should be 
restored in the credit and finance system and currency 
regulation. Likewise, a law on fighting corruption urgently 
needs to be passed. As early as 26 January 1993, the Supreme 
Council issued a decree in the second point of which it 
committed itself to approve, within one month, the legal and 
legislative notions of such phenomena as corruption, the mafia, 
organized crime, the shadow economy. However, this decree has 
not been carried out to this day. The next law is about a ban on 
the involvement of people's deputies in commercial and banking 
activities personally, through intermediaries, or through 
individuals fronting for them, which is not being complied with, 
either. The law on fighting corruption and organized crime 
should specify the level of liability--from ethical and moral to 
criminal. Yet another law in this area is the law on the 
dismissal of officials by virtue of a lack of confidence, which 
would indicate clearly for the commission of which violations an 
official, beginning with the president and on down to a clerical 
worker of the lowest rank, would be dismissed and no longer have 
the right to work in state organs and government organs. It is 
also necessary to pass a law on the recall of people's deputies 
and on stripping them of their powers, which would clearly 
regulate in what cases this would be done. 
  We have developed these priority draft laws. If such is the 
will of the Supreme Council, we may put the draft laws on the 
table in a month and a half. It is also worthwhile to write the 
following into the law on the recall of people's deputies and 
stripping them of their powers: "If a deputy has committed 
violations he shall be deprived of the credentials of deputy and 
shall never again have the right to run for the Supreme Council 
or another representative organ." People should know that by 
transgressing the law they rob themselves forever of access to 
the sphere of state power. This is what should be done and 
adopted first of all. 
  As far as the economic union is concerned, it is possible 
that at some point it will be an integrated structure on the 
model of the European Union. However, both Russia and Ukraine 
must be built up as states first. If Ukraine grows strong, we 
will have more confidence. However, for now it is premature to 
talk about a union, a common economic space. 
  [Ye. Zherebetskyy] This issue is a new, camouflaged tactical 
move by our Communists. 
  [O. Lavrynovych] The logic is simple in this instance. 
Russia 
does not want the Union to be restored; it wants to restore the 
classical version of an empire. To this end, it needs a colony, 
its own Communist colony, because it was always easier to deal 
with a Communist colony. However, the world would look at 
Ukraine as something that does not merit serious attention 
because the owner exists--the patron that would set the 
direction for that state. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] That is, Russia. 
  [M. Ratushnyy] Of course. To prevent this, we should always 
ensure economic independence first of all rather than an 
economic union, as those want who desire to bury the Ukrainian 
state. Economic independence may only obtain in a complex with 
the structural opportunity to influence the processes of change 
in the forms of property. That is, this cannot be politics in 
itself. At present, the most urgent task for us is to change the 
structure of power and to clearly determine its functions. With 
state property accounting for 93-95 percent, legislative acts on 
precisely state power and self-government will be crucial. What 
does the economy begin with? With property. Who is administering 
property at present? The state authorities. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Officials. These are the best conditions 
for 
corruption. They steal what is owned by the state. 
  [M. Ratushnyy] How else? Why do they want to keep kolkhozes? 
The people who work there steal a kopek's worth, the chairman 
steals 10 karbovantsy's worth, those who manage in the rayon 
steal thousands, and those who are at the top--millions. 
  Those who make policy today do not think about the day after 
tomorrow. Few think even about tomorrow. Since we are talking 
about the initial steps, we should first of all make legislative 
decisions concerning changes in the structure of property, the 
generation of budgets at all levels, and taxation. High taxes 
especially contribute to smothering the economy. Nobody looks at 
analogies that have occurred in other states. One gets the 
impression that nobody has read economic textbooks and nobody 
knows that production begins to be depressed above 35 percent, 
and at above 5 [as published] percent, production already begins 
to collapse. What do we have? 
  We, the Ukrainian nationalists, are precisely in favor of 
introducing firm order in the economy; ours is the position of a 
social market economy. I think that nobody is talking about the 
pursuit of a protectionist policy with regard to our national 
producers, with the exception of Pynzenyk. The policy of 
neocolonialism is not carried out only from the east, but is 
effectively implemented from the west. Everything is being done 
to destroy production in Ukraine and the producer. I believe 
that the strict monitoring of export and import operations is 
necessary. 
  I agree with Omelchenko that it would be more moral to still 
make amendments to the law "On the Status of People's Deputies," 
in which to give up immunity. Deputy immunity is the armor 
behind which various fraud is frequently perpetrated. It is also 
necessary to make an amendment concerning arrangements for the 
real recall of deputies. 
<H5>  A Union, but Only an Economic One </H5>
  [S. Volkovetskyy] When there is talk of an economic union, 
it 
is obvious that they misuse it, and misused it for 70 years by 
calling the state a union. 
  We are not against an economic union with Russia, but a 
union 
such as with Germany, France, Japan, or the United States, on a 
mutually advantageous basis. I believe that we should think 
about how to replenish the budget, where to get money, and how 
to manage it correctly. 
  If we indeed proceed to introduce reforms, offer incentives 
to our national producers, and create conditions whereby it is 
profitable to manufacture products, the budget will be ensured, 
too. 
  It is also important to pass the law "On Local Authorities." 
Being the chairman of an oblast council and understanding how 
imperfect this system is, I think that it is certainly necessary 
for us to not frustrate the forthcoming elections to the local 
organs of power. In a word, we need to work, rather than waste 
time. 
  [H. Omelchenko] It would appear that there is nothing 
frightening: an economic union or some other union. However, I 
will say what I know by virtue of the specifics of my work. It 
was fall 1992. A group of people's deputies of the former Soviet 
Union got together. 
  A part of the group consisted of active-service generals and 
senior officers. The generals who spoke stated that in Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, and Ukraine there were many military men in 
leadership positions who were prepared to carry out an order to 
create the united armed forces of the Soviet Union and to 
restore it. The decision was also made there to do everything in 
order to discredit President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, 
Minister of Defense K. Morozov, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet 
of Belarus Shushkevich, and President of Russia Yeltsin. Now let 
us look at what we have as of now: Morozov is gone, and so is 
Shushkevich. 
  A couple of months ago, the Union of Officers of Russia got 
together with the people's deputies of the State Duma in the 
Moscow area; a plan for the restoration of the Soviet Union was 
developed there. Officers who serve in the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine also attended. That is to say, the development of the 
military-political scenario from the fall of 1992 continues. Is 
it an accident that the former general Rutskoy states that we 
will celebrate the 50th anniversary of victory over German 
Fascism in a unified Soviet Union? We should grasp the fact that 
neither the United States nor other highly developed countries 
need Ukraine as an independent, strong state. This is why we may 
be offered, in whatever packaging, a slice of the ruble zone and 
something else of the kind in order to deprive Ukraine of 
independence. 
  On 1 December 1991, we said for all time: Ukraine is a 
state. 
Therefore, let us do everything for it to indeed be great, 
prosperous, and rich. 
  [V. Mukhin] As far as the issue of overcoming the crisis is 
concerned, I can say the following: Our Socialist Party has an 
anticrisis economic program, which Moroz proposed at one point. 
We submitted it to the Cabinet of Ministers and to the 
president. At that time, the president responded thus: "If you 
come to power, you will then implement your programs." I think 
that the economic program that we have developed and that both 
the Communist Party and the group of the Peasant Party perceive 
correctly will be approved by the Supreme Council because it is 
aimed at improving the life of the people. 
  It will be best for Ukraine to overcome the crisis if there 
is an economic, industrial-defense, and political union with 
Russia. Why? Well, mine is a very large district, and all 
enterprises that are located there are defense enterprises. 
These are enterprises of the highest standard, which could 
manufacture marvelous products that Russia badly needs. We could 
substantially improve our standard of living owing solely to the 
Russian defense orders. However, the situation is such that 
Russia is saying: "Let us sign a relevant agreement." As they 
explained to me, to this end at a minimum 50 agreements 
concerning a defense union need to be signed. 
  Now let us look at another aspect of the issue--do we have 
an 
actual defense union with Russia or not? Everyone turns a blind 
eye to the fact that actually this union exists. We have a 
common defense system, a common system of weapon supply to the 
troops, common intelligence and counterintelligence systems if 
we take the pertinent agreement into account; we have a common 
system of staff command, and so on. The defense union actually 
exists, but it has not been formalized legally and politically. 
Annually, we lose tremendous funds because of this. 
  As far as the defense sector is concerned, many people 
understand that this is a huge complex that employs about 7 
million people. It concentrates colossal profits for 
Ukraine--this is a lack of understanding, I would say national 
tunnel vision, which causes us to suffer enormous losses. We do 
not lose "independence" [word rendered in Ukrainian in the 
original]! As far as our bloc is concerned, we are preparing a 
draft law on issues that are the most important for the people. 
The first issue that is of great concern to all is: How will 
compensation be provided for the deposits of the population that 
the state actually took away shamelessly, primarily from old 
people? 
  I am not an economist, but I am studying, and for this 
reason 
I believe that a law on taxes is also very important. I am a 
proponent of the need to support large state enterprises, being 
aware that they will generate enormous profits for the state if 
everything is structured intelligently. 
  Now about the newspaper. Personally, I do not like the 
newspaper. Recently it has been one-sided, and the editor has 
taken a one-sided position, although he did state at the 
beginning that he would be objective and would cover the 
positions of various structures. We would like the people's 
deputies, especially the factions, to cooperate with their 
newspaper closely. It should reflect objectively all the events 
that happen. Some deputies say that they even look at HOLOS with 
caution, although it is the newspaper of the Supreme Council. It 
does not matter who dislikes which news, but these views should 
also be reflected in the newspaper. 
  [P. Movchan] Apparently, a public editorial board should be 
put together, which would be formed on certain definite 
principles: either along factional lines or in another manner. 
However, let us not forget that the newspaper does not belong to 
either the majority or the minority--it is a newspaper of the 
Supreme Council, and the entire spectrum of political life 
should exist in its pages. The ultimate task of both the 
parliament and its organ is to facilitate the strengthening and 
building of the Ukrainian state. This is the mainstay. 
  It appears to me that this newspaper needs to have a 
supplement. As I see it, there is a lack of theoretical pages 
within it, theoretical articles on a certain aspect of what is 
going on in the state. I am certainly curious about the dubbing 
situation. We have a state language. An altogether different 
newspaper should exist for the Russian-speaking population. 
  Apart from everything else, a Russian newspaper is needed in 
order to provide information on life in Ukraine in the CIS area. 
Its nature might be that of a digest. 
  [V. Mukhin] I think that the Supreme Council and the 
newspaper should cooperate and bring truthful information to the 
reader as much as possible.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Malinkovich under the rubric "Ukraine": </F>
"Dangerous Games"] 
  [Text] When journalists asked the leader of one of 
the Ukrainian parties, Volodymyr Filenko, last Friday "Does the 
decision of the Crimean parliament to restore the Crimean 
Constitution adopted on 6 May 1992 mean war?" he answered: "I 
think it does." 
  Could there really be a war between Ukraine and Russia over 
the Crimea? It is impossible to believe. However, reports are 
coming from Simferopol about the appearance of dozens of armored 
personnel carriers in the outskirts of the Crimean capital. I 
see from my window a nationalist demonstration descending toward 
the Khreshchatyk, with the demand to strip the Crimea of its 
autonomy written on the banners. In a television picture from 
the chamber of the Crimean parliament: The deputies are 
delighted by their own courage. I cannot understand what they 
are happy about. As it is, they have put the country on the 
brink of a war between the fraternal peoples (I will not shrink 
from this combination of words, which has suddenly fallen from 
grace) whereas they could have resolved everything amicably. Did 
the Crimean deputies really fail to understand that they have 
fallen into a trap set by those who do not wish the election to 
be held on schedule? 
  Leonid Kravchuk has been talking for a long time now about 
the need to cancel or at any rate postpone the June presidential 
election. 
  The president played by old rules, but the situation in the 
country began to change. A new Ukrainian parliament has operated 
for just two weeks, but the possible direction of the country's 
political life after the election is already emerging. Two 
events have been particularly indicative. 
  By an impressive margin, a majority of the Supreme Council 
voted to strip the well-known liberal, Volodymyr Hrynyov, of his 
deputy credentials because, through the fault of the Central 
Electoral Commission (and contrary to his will!), he ended up 
without a competitor in the second round. The credentials of two 
Communist deputies who had been elected to the parliament in the 
exact same manner as Hrynyov were confirmed. In essence, 
Volodymyr Hrynyov was punished for his liberalism. Here is what 
is interesting: Not only the "Reds" voted against Hrynyov but 
also the nationalists who feared Hrynyov's adherence to the idea 
of a rapprochement between Ukraine and Russia and other CIS 
countries. It suddenly came out that the national forces that 
were defeated in the election are prepared under certain 
circumstances to form an alliance with not only the former 
nomenklatura Communists who have given up their party membership 
cards, but also with the Communists who have remained faithful 
to their dogmas. One would think it was no accident that 
immediately after the election, the Rukh [Ukraine People's 
Movement] leader, Volodymyr Chornovil, stated that the MBR 
[Interregional Reform Block] of Kuchma and Hrynyov appeared to 
him more dangerous than the communists. 
  Nonetheless, there will not be a strong alliance between the 
nationalists, even moderate nationalists, and the communists. 
They will not agree on the issue of an attitude toward Russia. 
On this score, the leftists have more in common with the 
centrists from the Kuchma-Hrynyov bloc, as was revealed by 
voting for candidates for the post of parliament chairman. At 
first, there were nine contenders. However, later five of them, 
including the leaders of the moderate nationalists, Chornovil 
and Yavorivskyy, withdrew their candidacies. The 
national-democrats understood that they would not corner the 
position of speaker; for this reason they supported the former 
Deputy Speaker Durdynets whose career was made in the Youth 
Communist League and subsequently in the militia--anyone but a 
proponent of integration processes. However, the chances of the 
radical nationalist from the extremist organization UNA-UNSO 
[Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian People's Self-Defense 
Forces], Yuriy Tyma, to win were none, just as those of a 
representative of the MBR, Oleksandr Karpiv, whose presentation 
in the parliament made a very good impression. The point is that 
the Kuchma-Hrynyov reformist bloc conducted the parliamentary 
campaign poorly, betting on the election of the president. 
Correspondingly, the deputy faction of the MBR turned out to be 
quite small. This is how it happened that in reality only two 
persons competed for the seat of parliament chairman--the leader 
of the bloc of leftist forces (communists, socialists, 
agrarians), Oleksandr Moroz, and the man of the nomenklatura, 
Vasyl Durdynets. The votes of their direct supporters were 
clearly insufficient for either. The nomenklatura man was 
supported by the nationalists, and the socialist by the 
centrists, including several deputies from the Kuchma bloc. They 
were the ones to ensure the victory of Oleksandr Moroz. 
  It is obvious that the centrists of L. Kuchma did not at all 
support O. Moroz selflessly. Of course, they are counting on a 
reciprocal step by the left. As it were, Oleksandr Moroz is one 
of seven candidates for the post of Ukrainian president. Leonid 
Kravchuk, Leonid Kuchma, Ivan Plyushch, and Volodymyr Lanovyy 
are his main rivals. Recently, Kravchuk's rating has declined. 
Kuchma's rating has been the highest for half a year now. The 
number of supporters of Plyushch and Lanovyy is now growing. 
They are supported by the nationalists; I will add that many 
people from Kravchuk's team are now going over to Plyushch, 
including the chiefs of the official mass media. The rating of 
Moroz is relatively low. However, the leftists are the most 
disciplined people and will certainly take an active part in 
voting. Generally, Moroz could get 25-30 percent of the vote; 
however, this is not enough to become president. However, if 
Moroz withdraws his candidacy, the chances of L. Kuchma will be 
preferable because only he and Moroz favor the reinforcement of 
the CIS, the Economic Union, and other forms of integration, 
which is what 80 percent of the citizens of Ukraine want. To my 
mind, the tandem of President Leonid Kuchma and Chairman of the 
Supreme Council Oleksandr Moroz is currently the optimal 
scenario for Ukraine in which it is plainly impossible to not 
reckon with the leftists' influence at present, and, at the same 
time, it is extremely undesirable to yield full power to them. 
  It is safe to suggest that the current president feels the 
most uncertain from among the "big five" candidates. By all 
signs, Leonid Kravchuk' time is coming to an end. However, the 
president does not want to go, all the more so because, in 
keeping with our rules, everyone tries to kick those who are 
leaving where it hurts. Kravchuk is doing everything he can to 
prevent the presidential election in June. It appears that it 
will be quite difficult, or virtually impossible to do at this 
point. Aware that a majority on the issue of canceling the 
election will not be gained without the leftists, L. Kravchuk is 
beginning to flirt with O. Moroz, and not unsuccessfully at 
that. Moroz has expressed his willingness to consider this 
problem in the parliament on the condition that the president 
comes out with the relevant initiative. In addition, the leftist 
leader proposed to discuss in the Supreme Council the issue of 
reducing presidential powers to the level of the head of state 
rather than the executive authorities. I think that Kravchuk 
would have agreed to that in order to keep anything at all. 
However, in this case, an amendment to the Constitution is at 
issue to which end 300 votes are necessary in a parliament that 
now has just 336 deputies. Therefore, the success of this 
endeavor is unlikely. Leonid Kravchuk cannot fail to understand 
this, and for this reason his main bet is on the destabilization 
of the general situation in Ukraine, which will give him a 
pretext to impose a state of emergency and reschedule the 
elections. This is why the "Crimean card" is being played now. 
  The wars in Nagorno-Karabakh, the Dniester area, Ossetia, 
Ingushetia, Chechnya, and Abkhazia have claimed a great many 
lives of the citizens of what once was a united state...where 
the right of the people to self-government clashed with another 
right--the right of the newly formed independent states to 
sovereignty. Only the experience of Tatarstan in this area may 
be considered favorable. I think that it should be used in 
solving the Ukraine-Crimea problem, the Crimea being within 
Ukraine but on a treaty basis. A treaty always envisions the 
participation of at least two parties rather than unilateral 
actions by the Kiev or Simferopol authorities. 
  On 24 May, Leonid Kuchma made a statement in which he 
proposed a quite constructive scenario for solving the Crimean 
problem. In particular, this statement says: "I am convinced 
that the territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders 
of Ukraine can and should be preserved while building relations 
with the Crimea on the basis of a treaty and the Constitutions 
of Ukraine and the Crimea." Considering Kuchma's good chances in 
the election on 26 June, we may count on the successful 
resolution of the conflict in the interest of both the Crimea 
and entire Ukraine in the immediate future. To be sure, the 
degree of readiness of the members of the Crimean parliament for 
negotiations is not quite clear. 
  At the same time, the situation in the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine has been sharply aggravated because the leftists and the 
Unity faction that supported them have managed to elect their 
people to the deputy speaker positions by majority votes. I 
think that, for now, the words of the Rukh leader, Vyacheslav 
Chornovil, to the effect that the Communists have accomplished a 
parliamentary coup are nothing but a hyperbole; however, the 
fact that the leftists have taken control of the entire 
leadership of the parliament cannot but give rise to serious 
concern.

Problems: "After the Presidential Elections"] 
  [Text] In the December 1992 referendum on the independence 
of Ukraine, 54.2 percent of the voters of Crimea voted for 
independence. It became immediately obvious after the plebiscite 
that the people had cast their votes for independence without 
being in the least guided by the national idea, but by a hope 
for a better economic situation, in comparison with Russia, and 
a quick reformation of the economy of Ukraine, whose 
possibilities were being touted by prominent politicians and 
economists. The lack of economic reforms led with catastrophic 
speed to a drop in the standard of living and placed the economy 
of Ukraine on the brink of a crash. 
  The Crimean parties and movements that came out for the 
independence of Crimea or annexation to Russia acquired a 
political weight in direct proportional dependence on a 
worsening of the economic situation. The most active was the 
Republican Movement of Crimea (later organized into the 
Republican Party of Crimea), headed by Yuriy Meshkov. 
  Yuriy Meshkov, who won convincingly in the presidential 
elections, gained this victory most of all owing to economic 
promises: The inclusion of Crimea in the ruble zone and the 
establishment of close economic ties with Russia. One of 
Meshkov's main promises before the first round of voting was the 
conduct of a referendum on the status of Crimea; however, after 
the adoption by the Ukrainian parliament of amendments to the 
Constitution that allowed the president of Ukraine to revoke the 
decisions of the Crimean authorities that do not conform to 
Ukrainian legislation, Meshkov softened his position 
significantly regarding relations with Ukraine just before the 
second round, and he even began to say that there is no question 
of secession from Ukraine. Meshkov did not set forth a distinct 
economic program describing the mechanism of proposed 
reorganizations, either during the preelection campaign or after 
his victory. A reputation for an unpredictable policy, which was 
reinforced among many observers, was confirmed by Meshkov during 
the course of his visit to Moscow, already as president. The 
sensation of this visit was the offer to Russian economist 
Yevgeniy Saburov of the post of prime minister of the Republic 
of Crimea after a two-day acquaintanceship. 
  A successful and quick reformation of the Crimean economy, 
which the newly elected president promises, is extremely 
problematic. There is no strong authority in Crimea now that is 
capable of implementing its decisions; there are no borders, 
customs, or an currency emissions bank. In fact, the Crimean 
economy cannot be fully fledged while being in strict dependence 
on the economy and monetary systems of Ukraine and Russia. 
  Local observers note the rather tense mutual relations of 
the 
president and the old managerial apparatus. The Supreme Soviet 
of Crimea and the "party in power" that was formed, relying on 
Nikolay Bagrov, the speaker of parliament, a rival of Meshkov in 
the presidential elections, is in no hurry to support the 
radical steps of the newly elected president that are capable of 
leading to a confrontation with Ukrainian authorities. Moreover, 
the invitation to Yevgeniy Saburov to work in the Crimea aroused 
displeasure both among a significant part of the local political 
elite and in government circles. 
  The first economic projects that could be heard from the 
lips 
of Yuriy Meshkov (the introduction of the ruble together with 
the Ukrainian coupon into monetary circulation, the use of 
Crimea as a landing site for "Shuttles" and "Burans") and 
Yevgeniy Saburov, who has assumed the duties of deputy prime 
minister (the establishment of a multiple currency regime, in 
which not only rubles and coupons will be in circulation 
simultaneously, but also dollars, marks, and others, and the 
speedy transformation of the Crimea into an international 
tourist health resort center) are unrealistic. 
  Crimea's economy is rigidly tied to the Ukrainian economy. 
It 
is sufficient to mention two factors that are essential to the 
vital activity of the peninsula: The drinking water and electric 
power come from Ukraine. A change in the status of the Crimea 
will at least lead to a switch to world prices for water and 
electric power, which the Crimean economy cannot endure. 
  On 24 February, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed the 
decree "On the Status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in 
Accordance with the Constitution and Legislation of Ukraine." 
The decree instructed the Supreme Council of Crimea in a month's 
time to bring the laws and Constitution of Crimea into 
conformity with Ukrainian legislation, and the president of 
Ukraine--to ensure the implementation of the law on the 
representation of the president of Ukraine in Crimea and 
together with the procurator general of Ukraine to react in a 
timely way to violations of the legislation of Ukraine by 
Crimean authorities. This document was Kiev's first reaction to 
the development of the Crimean situation after the election of 
the president, and it became a warning on the readiness of 
Ukrainian authorities to take harsh measures in the event of 
attempts to change the status of Crimea. 
  The position of official Kiev is supported by the majlis of 
the Crimean Tatar people. It declared its nonrecognition of the 
institution of president, which is recorded in the Crimean 
Constitution, inasmuch as it was adopted without the 
participation of representatives of the indigenous people, and 
also nonrecognition of the presidential powers of persons whose 
policy will be directed at ignoring the right of the Crimean 
Tatars to self-determination. Thus, the Crimean Tatars reserve 
for themselves the right of acts of civil disobedience and even 
more resolute measures. 
  It can be claimed that stability in the Republic of Crimea 
will depend to a significant degree on the position of Russia, 
which has not been clearly stated at an official level to this 
day. The attempts to strengthen Russian influence in Crimea on a 
state level will lead to serious complications in 
Russian-Ukrainian relations and will most likely arouse a 
negative reaction on the part of the world community. This 
variant is entirely possible: Ukraine will reject the removal of 
nuclear weapons from its territory in the event of unilateral 
actions by Russia with respect to Crimea, inasmuch as this will 
be a violation of the guarantees of security given by Russia in 
the signing of pertinent documents. Thus, Crimea becomes one of 
the important factors of the stability of the European part of 
the former USSR.

<F P=106> [Article by O. Lystopad: "A Morgue with 900,000 People"] </F>
  [Text]Everything looks decent on the outside. There 
are no corpses on the streets and no one is writhing in terminal 
agony. The residents of the city go about their affairs or wait 
patiently in queues. You can see smiles and lovers kissing in 
oblivion of their surroundings. But you have merely to glance at 
the famous Zaporizhstal, a factory devoted to iron alloys, and 
Dnieper electrode works to be convinced that the city has no 
future. 
  Zoporizhzhya is squeezed between two industrial malls. From 
whenever the wind blows it carries poison. In calm times all the 
effluent from the smokestacks settles on the plants themselves. 
Viewing the passing scenery in going to Pavlo-Kichkas by a 
trolley you'll see the irregular plant building covered by white 
powder, changing to gray, black, brown or green, depending on 
what is being produced. 
  A lot of people live close to the plants thanks to Stalin's 
dictum that "The Soviet worker should be able to walk to work." 
As if that is not enough, the location of a children's 
sanatorium and a tuberculosis hospital in such a setting 
underscores this lunacy. 
  While other parts of the city appear cleaner, entering any 
of 
the industrial plants is not recommended. At the plant producing 
abrasives you'll encounter, in addition to black- and red-dyed 
workers, skin colors that evolution has not been able to produce 
in a million years. 
  Statistics confirm the visual impression of a terminally ill 
city. The "National Lecture on Environmental Conditions in 
Ukraine" shows that during the past decade air levels of dust, 
nitrogen dioxide, phenols, benz(a)pyrene, and formaldehyde in 
Zaporizhzhya exceeded threshold limit values. Formaldehyde 
emissions increase every year, showing an almost three-fold jump 
in 1991. 
  I shall use formaldehyde to explain what is happening. My 
career started at the Chair of Topographic Anatomy of the 
Zaporizhzhya Medical Institute where students came to improve 
their surgical skills on cadavers. The department had its own 
little morgue and used formaldehyde to preserve the cadavers. 
Because we had to work with formalin, a highly toxic 40 percent 
solution of formaldehyde in water, we received extra milk and 
pay. By analogy, when it rains, Zaporizhzhya is bathed in 
formalin and transformed into a huge morgue. 
  Interestingly enough, official and unofficial findings 
coincide. The spring before last Greenpeace Ukraine borrowed 
mobile laboratories and personnel from Germany for a week of 
round-the-clock air monitoring for dust, and sulfur, nitrogen 
and carbon oxides. In Zaporizhzhya the concentrations of 
nitrogen oxides were lower than in Hamburg, Munich and 
Berlin--cities with greater industrial development--but dust 
levels were far greater in Zaporizhzhya. At the "Zaporizhstal" 
ferroalloy and electric blast furnace plant some 30 percent of 
the emissions are untreated, a figure reaching 70 percent at the 
coke chemical plant. At other plants pollution control equipment 
is in disrepair: at the aluminum plant 30 percent of the 
equipment is either not working or ineffective. Moreover, such 
equipment is often turned off for reasons of economy. 
  In some advanced countries pollution control measures simply 
consisted of taking water at a safe distance from the site of 
sewage discharge. In view of the volume of waste waters in 
Zaporizhzhya such an approach is virtually impossible. Municipal 
water treatment plants are overwhelmed and inefficient, and an 
accident a couple of years ago led to direct discharge of 
untreated sewage into the Dnieper, resulting in some very fat 
bullheads. 
  There is a tributary of the Dnieper called red river, which 
is spelled with a small letter to reflect its color since it 
carries effluent from a metallurgical plant. Combined with the 
contributions from other plants, the Dnieper reservoir now 
boasts concentrations of copper and zinc that exceed threshold 
limit values 15- to 25-fold, while the excess of phenols is on 
the order of 2- to 6-fold. When you drink this water you can 
almost physically feel the development of intestinal cancer. 
Then, of course, petrochemicals add an aroma all of their own. 
These factors led the Ministry of Nature Protection to describe 
one of the local rivers, Mokra Moskovka, as having an "ecosystem 
with elements of regression." In other words, the river is dying 
and taking the popular "Dubovyy Hay" park with it. 
  Only Khortytsya, an island in the middle of the city is left 
for recreation. But it is suffering from an overabundance of 
visitors, a factor not lost on children. They proposed a project 
to protect Khortytsya and won a prize at the All-Ukrainian 
Children's Ecological Congress. But they don't make the rules, 
their recommendations don't count, and the island continues to 
deteriorate. Kaniv Reservoir has also made it presence felt: 
700-year old oaks in "Dubovyy Hay" are dying because of 
inundation. 
  Finally, veritable acid rain factories have been located in 
the proximity of Zaporizhzhya. They include the Zaporizhzhya 
DRES which annually emits 50 tonnes of nitrogen oxides and 130 
tonnnes of sulfur oxides into the atmosphere, and the 
Zaporizhzhya nuclear power station that continually provides a 
powerful head of steam. A slight wind in the right direction 
assures the city an acid cocktail! 
  Those living in Zaporizhzhya have grown used to these 
horrors. But what are they to do if their living depends on the 
industry and the cost of pollution control measures are 
prohibitive? Our pockets are empty and foreign investors are 
reticent to invest if the economic climate is uncertain. The 
parliament could care less about these conditions and ecology. 
Everything boils down to who is more patriotic and whether their 
work is hindered more by the president or the cabinet. 
Hopefully, the new deputies will be more ecologically aware.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Specifics and Progress of </F>
Privatization in the Ukrainian Agro-Industrial Complex"] 
  [Text] A program for reforming the ownership arrangements 
of enterprises in the dairy and meat industries in 1994, which 
has been developed by the Main Administration of the Dairy 
Industry (Holovmolprom) and the Main Administration of the Meat 
Industry (Holovmyasprom) of the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Foodstuffs of Ukraine, calls for the privatization of 314 dairy 
and 90 meat- processing enterprises. 
  The production potential of the agro-industrial complex, as 
the domain of the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs of 
Ukraine, consists of 433 enterprises of the Holovmolprom, of 
which 370 are dairy enterprises. Some 109 meat-processing 
enterprises and 149 state-owned sovkhozes, which specialize in 
animal husbandry, report to the Holovmyasprom. As of the 
beginning of April of this year, 93 dairy enterprises (21 
percent of the total number) and 40 meat- processing enterprises 
plus five sovkhozes, 17 percent, were privatized. 
  At present, integrated agro-industrial associations are 
being 
created in the agro-industrial complex with the participation of 
agricultural producers, processing enterprises, and trading 
organizations through their transformation into public 
joint-stock companies: In the dairy industry, 31 associations 
have been created, and in the meat-processing industry--21. Some 
581 and 406 company- operated outlets, respectively, operate in 
these sectors at present. For now, the leasing of property 
remains the main ownership arrangement; 187 enterprises of the 
dairy industry and 58 enterprises and sovkhozes of the 
meat-processing industry operate in this format. 
  The reluctance of agricultural commodity producers to 
deliver 
their products to monopoly enterprises that engage in processing 
milk and meat has recently become a characteristic peculiarity 
of the agro- industrial complex. The farms are setting course 
for the acquisition of their own minicomplexes for smoking meats 
and other processing equipment. 
  According to data from the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Foodstuffs, at the enterprises privatized with the participation 
of agricultural producers the proportion of the stock held by 
the latter remains comparatively small; besides, it differs 
substantially in different Ukrainian oblasts. Thus, at the 
Novaya Odessa Cheese Plant (Nikolayev Oblast), the share of 
commodity producers comes to 49 percent and at 
CHERKASSYRMOLPROM, to 35 percent, whereas at the LUHANSKMOLPROM 
leased enterprise, this indicator is as low as 14.2 percent, and 
at the Gadyach Cheese Plant (Poltava Oblast), 4.3 percent. At 11 
enterprises in Odessa Oblast, at whose facilities the Odessa 
Joint-Stock Company for Meat Production and Processing was 
created, the proportion of stock held by agricultural producers 
came to 52 percent, at the Konotop Meat-Processing Combine to 73 
percent, and at the Zaporozhye Combine to 40 percent. 
  At present, 47 enterprises of the dairy industry are 
undergoing privatization. The fastest pace of privatization is 
characteristic of Kiev and Cherkassy Oblasts--22 enterprises in 
each, Chernigov Oblast--21 enterprises, and Donetsk and Lugansk 
Oblasts--19 enterprises in each. In the meat industry, 29 
meat-processing enterprises are being privatized: six in 
Vinnitsa Oblast, three in Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast, two 
enterprises in Kiev, Kirovograd, and Poltava Oblasts each, four 
enterprises in Sumy and Khmelnitskiy Oblasts each, five 
enterprises in Cherkassy Oblast, and one enterprise in Chernigov 
Oblast. 
  The above statistics indicate that although privatization in 
the agro-industrial complex of Ukraine is advancing, it is 
advancing very reluctantly. According to data from the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Foodstuffs, associations in Transcarpathian, 
Rovno, and Chernovtsy Oblasts have not embarked on the 
privatization of enterprises in the dairy industry at all. As 
far as the meat- processing industry is concerned, enterprises 
in Volyn, Dnepropetrovsk, Transcarpathian, Nikolayev, Rovno, 
Ternopol, Kharkov, Kherson, and, once again, Chernovtsy Oblasts 
bring up the rear.

<F P=106> [Article by Herbert Heller: "Mr. Zvyahilskyy Maintains One </F>
Thing, and in Real Life, It Is Quite Another. This Does Not Make 
It Any Better for Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Acting Prime Minister Zvyahilskyy believes "There is 
no economic crisis in Ukraine." The No. 2 leader in the state 
either does not read the bulletins of the Ministry of 
Statistics, or is not knowledgeable about economics, or wants to 
put a good face on in a bad situation. 
  Judge for yourselves. Compared to the first quarter of 1993, 
the volume of industrial production fell by 38.4 percent in the 
first quarter of this year, the output of foodstuffs fell by 
39.2 percent, and retail sales were off 47.6 percent. The 
accounts payable by Ukraine to the CIS countries exceed accounts 
receivable by 14 trillion [currency not specified], including 
those payable to Russia--by 10 trillion [currency not 
specified]. Simple calculations indicate that in February alone, 
Ukraine's exports to the CIS countries fell by 7.4 trillion 
karbovantsy. On the domestic market, the Ukrainian national 
economy is running on debt: Accounts receivable increased by 30 
trillion karbovantsy in February, and accounts payable by 36.6 
trillion karbovantsy. As of 1 March 1994, the total debt came to 
172 trillion karbovantsy, which comes to no less than 80 percent 
of the national product. This was a factor in expenditures from 
the state budget exceeding revenues by more than 5 trillion in 
just two months because there was nothing to pay taxes with. If 
this condition in Ukraine is not an economic crisis, then what 
is a crisis? This happened while taxes and withholdings for 
centralized funds in the first quarter came to 89 percent of the 
amount of proceeds. Out of each karbovanets in proceeds, as 
little as 10 kopeks was left at the disposal of enterprises. 
Where are the enterprises to get internal funds for technical 
development, retrofitting, and conversion in order to begin 
structural changes at their level? 
  Recently, there has been very much talk about the growth of 
prices for products and goods. In January through February 
alone, the value-added tax and the excise tax came to almost 9 
trillion karbovantsy, or 25.7 percent of the revenues of the 
state budget. Add to this the higher outlays on materials, 
energy resources, credit rates, and the preservation of the 
breakdown of producer cost with the volume of production falling 
simultaneously, and you will easily imagine the rate of growth 
of wholesale and retail prices. 
  Mr. Zvyahilskyy boasts that the current government has 
curtailed inflation. However, the price paid for this has been 
so high that one would not know what is more terrifying--the 
temporary curtailment of inflation or the general slump in 
production, budget deficit, and deterioration of the financial 
standing of the people. The same Ministry of Statistics bulletin 
contains data on the size of the average monthly income per 
employee in 1993. Frankly, the numbers are revealing. Employees 
with the highest incomes were in the merchant marine--256,449 
karbovantsy, construction--231,693 karbovantsy, railway 
transportation--218,043 karbovantsy, the staff of state and 
sectoral management--205,678 karbovantsy, and banks and 
insurance companies--518,313 karbovantsy. Employees had the 
lowest incomes in culture--99,765 karbovantsy, arts--98,485 
karbovantsy, consumer services--77,727 karbovantsy, public 
catering--101,451 karbovantsy, health care--114,677 karbovantsy, 
agricultural production--118,455 karbovantsy, higher 
schools--137,643 karbovantsy, secondary schools--116,204 
karbovantsy, science-- 147,866 karbovantsy, and motor vehicle 
transportation--145,264 karbovantsy. As can be seen, individuals 
working in the social sphere that is financed from the state 
budget were the first ones to suffer. For reference, the average 
monthly income in Ukraine was 173,876 karbovantsy, including 
that of employees of machine building--148,952 karbovantsy--and 
of light industry--173,705 karbovantsy. 
  If one reads the bulletin of the Ministry of Statistics 
carefully, he may determine unequivocally that government policy 
in managing the economy in the environment of Ukrainian 
independence has been a fiasco. The V. Fokin, L. Kuchma, L. 
Kravchuk, and Yu. Zvyahilskyy governments have displayed 
elementary short-sightedness in governing the state with 
deference to the habitual stereotypes and following the lead of 
managers of state enterprises, large and small, who religiously 
cling to the stereotypes of "developed socialism": to provide 
first for themselves and then for the collective, and to give 
what remains to our society. This is precisely what has resulted 
in the priorities of state policy, what was prompted by the 
director "lobby." The social aspects of this policy were merely 
declaratory.... This is precisely why the volume of agricultural 
production and the output of foodstuffs dropped by a factor of 
two compared to 1991. Despite the attempts to pass off the 
desirable as being real, the agro-industrial complex has now 
long been in a state of economic collapse. This is precisely why 
prices for foodstuffs have increased by a factor of 15,500 on 
the average, whereas wages-- by a factor of 3,500 at the very 
most. 
  The process of overcoming the crisis in Ukraine and the 
restructuring of its economy will take at least six or seven 
years because we will have to overcome intellectual backwardness 
(may the jingoist patriots forgive me), as well as technological 
and organizational backwardness. There are many proposals for 
overcoming the crisis. They include replacing fiscal taxation 
with a progressive taxation that gives the producers of goods an 
incentive to manage more effectively, the need to reduce 
expenditures for defense, government, and funding of the 
national economy (as people in the know think, this is nothing 
but support for state enterprises on the brink of bankruptcy); 
fundamentally new foreign-economic legislation that would 
encourage the Ukrainian producers of goods to export competitive 
products. This also includes a privatization program for 1995 
that will most likely remain on paper. However, all of this does 
not make sense until the leadership of the state changes, until 
the state sees fit to change its stance on the development of 
science and education in Ukraine, and finally, until the supreme 
officials stop maintaining that there is no economic crisis in 
Ukraine....

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Main Indicators of the Operation of </F>
Small Industrial Enterprises of Ukraine"] 
  [Text] At the beginning of 1994, 13,600 small enterprises 
operated in the Ukrainian industrial sector. According to data 
from the Ukrainian Ministry of Statistics, this was 9,300 
enterprises more than in 1991. This was 3,300 more enterprises 
than the number registered before the beginning of 1993. 
  The number of employees who work in this sector came to 
approximately 261,000 at the beginning of 1994 (in 1992--2.3 
percent fewer), or one-quarter of all individuals employed in 
the sphere of small business and 4.3 percent of those employed 
in the industry of Ukraine (last year this indicator came to 3.9 
percent). 
  The volume of total proceeds from the sale of products, 
work, 
and services in prices in effect exceeded 4 trillion karbovantsy 
in 1993. Products of small industrial enterprises worth 562 
billion karbovantsy (17.9 percent of the receipts) were sold to 
the population. 
  The ownership arrangements of small industrial enterprises 
and the ratio of their share to the total volume of product 
sales: Some 7,300 enterprises are private--47.4 percent; 5,200 
are collective enterprises--42.3 percent; 750 enterprises are 
state-owned--7.3 percent. 
  The main sectors in which small industrial enterprises 
operate are machine building and metal working (37.2 percent of 
the total number of small industrial enterprises), light 
industry (15.2 percent), wood processing and the pulp and paper 
industry (8.8 percent), the production of building materials 
(7.5 percent), and food processing (3.7 percent). This sectoral 
breakdown of small industrial enterprises is characteristic of 
all regions of Ukraine. 
  Outlays on product manufacturing at the small industrial 
enterprises exceeded 2 trillion karbovantsy in 1993. Some 983 
billion karbovantsy (42.6 percent) was used to buy raw and other 
materials, and 420 billion karbovantsy (18.1 percent) was used 
for wages. Outlays accounted for 0.58 karbovantsy per each 
karbovanets of the products sold. 
  For the most part, the small industrial enterprises have 
their own production assets, the value of which came to 793 
billion karbovantsy as of the beginning of 1994. Leased assets 
accounted for 10.3 percent (91 billion karbovantsy).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ukrainian Socioeconomic Situation in </F>
the First Quarter of 1994"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Industry </H5>
  A decline in production accelerated in Ukraine in the first 
quarter of 1994. The gross domestic product fell by 34 percent 
compared to the corresponding period of 1993 and the national 
income by 36 percent. The decline in production reached the 
highest level since the beginning of the year. Compared to the 
first quarter of 1993, the volume of production fell by 38 
percent and labor productivity fell by 32 percent. More than 75 
percent of the industrial enterprises reduced the volume of 
production. The greatest drop in the output of products was 
registered in ferrous metallurgy, the chemical, petrochemical, 
refinery, light and pulp-and-paper industries, machine building, 
and the construction materials industry. 
  A decline in the production of the main types of energy 
resources in the fuel and energy industries was also registered. 
On the whole, 27.3 million tonnes of fuel were produced, which 
was 4.3 million tonnes (or 14 percent) less than in the first 
quarter of 1993. The volume of primary oil refining fell by more 
than one-half, and the production of motor gasoline, diesel 
fuel, and heavy fuel oil diminished accordingly. 
  The drop in production has affected a majority of the key 
types of products in the chemical and petrochemical industries, 
mineral fertilizers, tires for trucks and passenger cars, 
synthetic resins, and plastics. The procurement of commercial 
wood and timber products fell in the timber industry; 
consequently, the output of the key types of products of the 
woodworking and pulp-and-paper industries declined 
substantially. The production of pulp, paper, and cardboard fell 
by a factor of five. 
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  Spring field work is underway in the entire territory of 
Ukraine. Before the beginning of May, farms had been planted: in 
spring crops--an area of 10 million hectares, which was 64.5 
percent more than was planted at that time the year before; in 
sugar beets-- 1.1459 million hectares; in sunflowers--592,300 
hectares; and in potatoes--73,800 hectares. 
  The situation in animal husbandry remains difficult although 
the first signs of its stabilization have appeared. The average 
daily increment in cattle and hog breeding and finishing 
increased for the first time in recent years. The average milk 
yield per cow on public-sector farms came to 424 kilograms in 
the first quarter compared to 413 kilograms during the 
corresponding period of 1993. However, in the first quarter of 
1994, the collective, interfarm agricultural enterprises, and 
sovkhozes produced almost one-third less meat in live weight 
than during the corresponding period of last year and 21 percent 
fewer eggs. Milk production was almost at the 1993 level. The 
volume of cattle and poultry breeding dropped by 11 percent. 
<H5>  Construction </H5>
  The pace of construction of facilities in the social sphere 
slowed down. Residential buildings, with a total floor space of 
967,000 square meters, with all forms of ownership were built, 
which is 46 percent less than in the corresponding period of 
last year. Less housing was built in Crimea, Kiev, and 
Sevastopol, as well as in 18 other oblasts. 
<H5>  Transportation Carriage </H5>
  The work of transportation has continued to deteriorate as a 
result of cutbacks in production, the disruption of economic 
relations, a failure to meet contractual obligations, and a fuel 
shortage. In the first quarter of this year, all modes of 
public-use transportation carried 206 million tonnes of freight 
(336 million tonnes during the corresponding period of 1993). 
The carriage of freight by railway transportation fell by 35 
percent. The volume of carriage by highway transportation fell 
by a factor of more than two (52 million tonnes of freight were 
carried). Some 6.3 million tonnes of freight were carried since 
the beginning of the year by all modes of transportation. The 
rate of decline in carriage came to 8 percent. Since the 
beginning of the year, all modes of transportation carried 1.1 
billion passengers. The rate of decline in carriage was 18 
percent. 
<H5>  Finance and Prices </H5>
  The processes of imbalance in state finances, as one of the 
manifestations of economic crisis, grew stronger. The Ukrainian 
state budget had a deficit of 8.6 percent. The emission of 
currency in the first quarter of this year came to 10.8 trillion 
karbovantsy and, compared to the corresponding period of 1993, 
increased by a factor of more than 36. 
  At the same time, a decline in the inflation rate was 
registered on a monthly basis in the first quarter of 1994. In 
January, the inflation index came to 119.2 percent, in February 
to 112.6 percent, and in March to 105.7 percent. 
  On the whole, consumer prices grew by a factor of 1.4 during 
the quarter (by a factor of 2.7 during the corresponding period 
of 1993). In the first quarter of 1994, the rate of growth of 
prices for nonfood goods and paid services for the population 
outpaced the rate of growth of prices for foodstuffs by a factor 
of two. Prices for certain groups of foodstuffs (meat products, 
butter, eggs, and citrus fruit) fell. For the most part, goods 
in the fruit and vegetable group became more expensive. Prices 
increased the most for children's clothing, children's footwear, 
books and newspapers, office supplies, and pharmaceuticals from 
among the nonfood consumer staples. From among paid services to 
the population, prices grew the most, by a factor of 2.8, for 
the services of public-use transportation (in view of higher 
airfares and railway fares), as well as for recreation, cultural 
services, and services of barber shops. 
  Before the beginning of January, the Ukrainian unemployment 
rate as a whole came to 0.29 percent of the population in the 
able-bodied age bracket. The average size of benefits per each 
unemployed individual came to 169,000 karbovantsy in March, 
compared to 100,000 karbovantsy in December 1993. 
  The Ukrainian population number stood at 52.1 million on 1 
April 1994. In the first quarter, the number of deaths exceeded 
that of births by 75,000. 
<H5>  Production of Consumer Goods </H5>
  In the first quarter of this year, such goods worth 55 
trillion karbovantsy were produced (this was 39 percent less 
than in the first quarter of 1993). Almost three-fourths of the 
enterprises reduced their output and, compared to the first 
quarter of 1993, failed to turn out goods worth 38 trillion 
karbovantsy. The output of the enterprises of the State 
Committee for the Food Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Foodstuffs accounted for more than 45 percent of this total, 
and that of the enterprises of the State Committee for the Light 
and Textile Industries, for almost 20 percent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Yushchenko, Ukrainian National Bank </F>
board chairman, by Petro Ovchar, under the rubric "An Interview 
With an Element of Surprise"; place and date not given: "Viktor 
Yushchenko: `My Heart Bleeds for Ukraine....'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
  [Ovchar] Viktor Andriyovych, as they say, may God help you 
to 
translate this plan into reality.... Now we would like to 
discuss strictly specific topics. Would you be so kind as to 
tell us how the Ukrainian National Bank cooperates with 
commercial banks? Have there been disagreements or problems? In 
general, what is your vision of the banking system of Ukraine in 
the future? 
  [Yushchenko] We might begin with the fact that a relevant 
law 
is the foundation for such cooperation in any state--a law on 
banks and banking. Two years ago, such a law was passed here (at 
the time, it was a democratic law). It set forth principles for 
relations in a majority of areas of banking. However--this is 
unambiguous--at present a legal foundation for the operation of 
the banking system needs to be laid in order to build a strong 
banking system. The difficulty lies in the fact that in the 
course of 1,000 years of its history, Ukraine has had no 
practice and experience in building a banking system, and the 
central bank in particular. It was the periphery, a financial 
province. We have now gained independence and our own monetary 
space. However, many contradictions have developed. The National 
Bank should be independent just as, for example, the Bundesbank 
operates in Germany. There is no force in that state that could 
cancel any decision of the Bundesbank. Only the chancellor has 
the right to suspend its main actions--that is, the 
Bundesbank's-- for 14 days. However, on the 15th day after a 
decision is made it goes into effect. Is it surprising that the 
independence of the Bundesbank has produced the strongest and 
healthiest currency in the world--the Deutsche mark? All Germans 
are grateful to the Bundesbank for upholding through its 
independent position the standard of standards--its monetary 
unit. That is, by now the following system has been created in 
Germany: If a person receives a Deutsche Mark, he receives not 
only tender, but also a means to save his wealth. Half a year 
from now, it will be the same as it is today. This is one of the 
functions of currency--to maintain the wealth of society in a 
stable manner. However, independence in the operation of the 
bank alone is not enough. We do remember that the relationship 
between quantity and quality is a dialectical contradiction. A 
single unit of emission already violates the ideology of 
stability. 
  What is the case in our state? Let us recall this: Did 
discussions not flare up at each of the past sessions of the 
Supreme Council or meeting of the Presidium--do we, or do we not 
have enough money in circulation? These discussions were 
initiated by production managers--directors of enterprises, 
kolkhoz chairmen, and others. We have a collective form of 
undermining the force of the national currency because for me as 
a banker the question of whether we have enough currency in 
circulation does not exist even in theory. As it is, the formula 
of operation of money in circulation is extremely simple: The 
total amount of money corresponds to the quantity of goods times 
their prices. The quantity of goods multiplied by prices 
produces money. If there is less money today while the quantity 
of goods is the same, their prices will be consequently lower. 
This is a simple, classical tenet, the golden rule of monetary 
circulation. In no country of the world do discussions develop 
over whether enough currency is in circulation because everyone 
understands that currency is in circulation, second after second. 
  At present, state structures account for 94 percent in our 
country. Many of them have their representatives in the 
parliament. They, these representatives, start the discussions 
about the currency shortage with just one objective: to improve 
the condition of their production units. As it is, they have no 
money because of the inefficient production of goods, which in 
addition sit forever in the warehouses because they are not in 
demand strictly due to their consumer features. Then state 
officials say: "Let us support this or that enterprise through 
emission because this is an important sector...." A decision 
concerning emission is made, and we obscure the picture of the 
market: We throw in a new portion of money, and the potentially 
bankrupt entity obtains new resources for its existence. This is 
how the impression is created that its operations are rational. 
One month passes, and the same problem arises.... I think that 
everybody understands what the conclusion is: The real cause 
cannot be eliminated by way of emission. We can merely postpone 
it. Emission is a very peculiar lever. Certainly, it should be 
used but the entire peculiarity of it is that the amount of 
emission brings about the devaluation of the national currency. 
There are things in a transitional economy that merit solving 
certain problems through emission. However, how can, say, 15 
percent out of the 94 percent of state monopoly enterprises be 
switched to regular economic conditions? This would mean that 80 
percent of the enterprises would be allowed to go into a free 
fall, and the latter means free bankruptcies; this is a social 
problem. In turn, an unsolved social problem brings about a 
political conflict. Strikes, hunger strikes, demonstrations, and 
so on begin. 
  A new membership of the Ukrainian Supreme Council has begun 
its work. If this parliament does not create a safe atmosphere 
for the operation of the banking system, including the 
commercial system, we will experience many complications in the 
area of economic restructuring. 
  With a view to streamlining the relations between the 
National Bank and commercial banks, we have appointed this year 
a special adviser to the National Bank board chairman who has 
worked for 15 years as a manager of one of the regional 
institutions of the Bundesbank. We are developing, putting it 
figuratively, a tree of laws for the banking system of Ukraine 
with his assistance. There will be two main laws: about the 
National Bank and about commercial banks. This is the pillar on 
which the entire banking system will rest. 
  [Ovchar] Certainly, for now you mean draft laws? 
  [Yushchenko] Of course, for now these are drafts. We have 
sent them to the central banks of many countries of the world in 
the hope of receiving consultations, remarks, and proposals. If 
the Supreme Council passes these laws, a law on national 
currency may also be adopted on the basis of them. If we keep 
the form of management that we had a year ago we will never 
build a healthy national monetary unit on such a basis. If we 
fail to build it we will never ensure the classical functions of 
currency. 
  We say that the national currency is a standard. It is so. I 
will give the following example. Let us take, say, the meter as 
the standard of length. As is known, it consists of 100 
centimeters. Three days go by, and we say: The meter is the 
standard of length, but there are only 98 centimeters in this 
meter. Half a year passes, it is the same meter that is the 
standard of length, but its value (in a figurative sense--the 
value of the coupon) is then 70 or 60 centimeters. Then the 
following question arises: Can anything be done under such 
conditions? A standard is being violated, the standard of 
standards! A currency can unite teachers, writers, steelworkers, 
miners, and bankers.... 
  The fourth quarter was dreadful for Ukrainian economy. All 
of 
this was a consequence of unprecedented emission-related 
decisions to procure grain and sugar, and monumental problems 
with the financial budget. We survived superhyperinflation. The 
first quarter of this year produced an immediate reaction: 
Production fell greatly. We just do not have the right to 
operate in the chaos that occurred in the fourth quarter! 
Therefore, controlling hyperinflation is the main economic 
objective. If there is hyperinflation we will not have a state, 
we will not have anything at all. Everyone's effort should be 
enlisted in controlling hyperinflation--at the level of each 
minister and each enterprise manager. As it were, inflation is 
only advantageous for the rich who have access to currency from 
emission and pernicious for all others who hold currency and do 
not know that one day they may suddenly be robbed not by some 
kind of street muggers but by the state, which has actually 
already happened many times.... 
  [Ovchar] Viktor Andriyovych, immediately after the 
proclamation of Ukraine as an independent state, a massive sale 
of apartments to foreign citizens began in Kiev, and not just in 
Kiev. A paradoxical situation has developed: Foreigners who two 
or three years ago bought apartments for $6,000-$8,000 are now 
selling them for five to six times more. That is, without 
incurring any outlays they profiteer at the expense of Ukraine, 
at your expense and mine. What is your view of this situation? 
Is there a way out of it? 
  [Yushchenko] The National Bank is aware of a technique to 
overcome this situation. However, it is unfortunate that most 
measures that should be taken are not the functions of the 
National Bank. This question may be broadened and expanded to 
many phenomena in our lives. We very frequently compare the 
exchange rate of the Ukrainian karbovanets to the rate of the 
American dollar and say: Isn't the U.S. currency strong! 
However, there are interesting things that we forget. Let us 
look at the dollar market while referring to the following 
comparison. Let us walk along a street in, say, Kiev and a 
similar street in any U.S. city. There, every square millimeter 
of the street and each structure contributes to the dollar 
because everything amounts to merchandise. Downtown is 
merchandise, the periphery of the city is merchandise. What is 
the case here? For example, there is a building opposite the 
National Bank. It has nothing to do with the karbovanets because 
it is the municipal sector. This sector is not a base for 
reinforcing the Ukrainian currency. Over the past year, we have 
changed the approach toward currency in certain areas. However, 
in the classical interpretation we are still very far from it 
being the symbol of the national monetary unit. If the stability 
of currency is not supported by an economic budget (a package of 
economic reforms), we will never have a stable currency. 
  So far, we have not liberalized prices, not only for 
apartments, but also rents, electricity rates, and so on. A 
system of two price lists is in effect. The state assumes a 
proportion of such outlays through the budget. As a result of 
this, a contradiction is created in the market. In this case, an 
apartment in Kiev costs no less than in New York. However, in 
view of the fact that our market is regulated by the state, that 
is, the state assists us with financing, the apartment is cheap. 
On the free market, the same apartment is appraised four times 
higher. Since our state tampers with the market through 
subsidies, the market value is distorted. The people who 
understand market trends take advantage of this. 
  [Ovchar] If I understood you correctly, these people are not 
to blame? 
  [Yushchenko] Certainly, it is the policy of the state rather 
than these people that is to blame. For example, why does a rich 
person in our state receive state subsidies for the square 
meters of housing, for electricity, for subway fares, and so on, 
and so forth? We need to liberalize prices. However, some may 
object: If we liberalize prices for apartments, they would say, 
5 million people will have no money to pay for them. So let the 
state pay these 5 million, but not the rest of those who have an 
opportunity to pay the real cost of apartments. How will our 
nation grow rich if everyone receives the same state 
compensation--those who make 30-40 million per month (there is 
no concealing it--there are such people) and those who make, 
say, 500,000 or less per month? 
  [Ovchar] Therefore, do we have an unhealthy social policy? 
  [Yushchenko] Precisely. For this reason, the National Bank 
champions the poor people. Our position is: Do not reduce social 
spending by a single karbovanets! However, the issue is how to 
channel such spending specifically toward the poor, rather than 
toward all. All states of the world always help the poor, 
whereas we help everyone without distinction. This is a great 
shortcoming of social policy that in two generations leads 
toward us never having a healthy national currency under such 
conditions. 
  We are used to working with distorted prices. For this 
reason, there should be a special price policy of the state. I 
will be more precise. We perceived the management of price 
policy as the general suppression of real prices. This 
differential between the real price and the one that is actually 
in effect here is covered from the budget. At that point, those 
from the budget organs come to the bank and say: "Print us money 
because we have to pay for this and that." Printing money in 
this particular manner means deliberately robbing the people. 
For this reason, I attach great hopes to the new parliament 
which, with assistance from us (I mean bankers, financiers, and 
economists alike) should focus its attention on the social 
problems of our people. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with O. Klympush, Minister of Transport, by V. </F>
Mayevskyy; place and date not given: "Transport Will Bring Us 
Out"] 
  [Text] When I received the assignment to interview 
Klympush, the minister of transport, as I walked to the ministry 
on Krasnoarmeysk Street and entered the reception area, as I 
read the name and patronymic of the minister on the door to his 
office, I was bothered by a persistent thought--where have I 
heard that name before? I am not too involved with transport 
issues at the editorial office, that is, I did not know Orest 
Dmitriyevich as a minister, but somewhere I had come across that 
name. It was not through personal acquaintance, since we have 
never met. It was only in the course of the conversation that my 
question was answered in a very unexpected manner, as you shall 
see below. 
  [Mayevskyy] First of all, it would be good to know just what 
the Ministry of Transport of Ukraine unifies. 
  [Klympush] We bring together the six main elements, formerly 
always owned by the state--railroads, aviation, motor, maritime, 
and river transport and motor highways. But, besides, let us 
say, the Southwestern Railway, many industrial ministries and 
agencies own their own railway tracks, and there are also 
private transport enterprises besides railways, with a clear 
government monopoly. Let us say Rechflot [River Fleet] was 
auctioned off, but after all, the waterways remain under 
government jurisdiction--we establish the state standards and 
determine tariffs. 
  [Mayevskyy] Pardon me, but there automatically arises the 
question as to whether all of these forms of transport are 
independent and capable of managing without the ministry. 
  [Klympush] They could manage without us, but the country, 
the 
state, could not. The client, the passenger, cannot manage 
either. After all, in their oblast the transport enterprises are 
most frequently monopolists, and they can demand any prices that 
are totally unfounded and manifest arbitrary behavior in other 
spheres of operation. We, however, must determine the rules, 
establish order, standards, restrictions, and requirements with 
respect to shipments. 
  Transport in Ukraine today is a vast and complex system, 
which, on the one hand, determines the statehood of Ukraine, and 
on the other hand carries out domestic shipping and maintains 
foreign ties necessary in our society. I have conducted an 
insistent and unambiguous policy for two years now, which suits 
contemporary world concepts of a ministry. It must be an organ 
of state regulation, which certainly does not set as its goal 
the literal management of economic problems of an enterprise. 
The ministry embodies the policy of the state owner, and it 
historically developed so that there was also a need to engage 
in purely managerial matters. At the present time there are not 
only state enterprises, and it is necessary to work with all 
types of property. That is the principal difference as compared 
with past years. 
  [Mayevskyy] But if an enterprise is operating well, it is 
also better for the state. 
  [Klympush] Yes. But the task of the ministry is to create 
favorable conditions for the operation of all enterprises. Not 
to be the substitute, a drover, an overseer, or be restrictive, 
but most importantly, it must not to be a supplier for them. 
  Naturally, the better an enterprise operates, the better it 
is for it and the state. We are interested in the formation of 
the budget and taxes, and we strive to determine where they 
should be increased or decreased, proceeding specifically from 
state interests. The ministry, however, cannot engage in routine 
economic management. 
  [Mayevskyy] Supply, however, is also a very powerful 
management lever, which allows you to influence enterprises. 
  [Klympush] Supply is no longer handled through the ministry; 
that phase has ended. At present there is no supply problem; 
there is only the problem of money. If an enterprise is 
profitable, if its expenditures are covered, then there are no 
problems. But the matter is that passenger transportation 
represents a branch that rarely yields profits from 
transportation itself. For industry transportation expenditures 
are always supplementary expenditures, and the smaller they are, 
the more efficient the operation and the cheaper production is. 
  Passenger transportation always means subsidies; that is the 
way it is everywhere in the world. It is therefore the task of 
the ministry to defend and promote that part of the budget to be 
spent on transport before state organs, the planners, and the 
Supreme Council, to indicate its rational direction, determine 
the paths of development, and substantiate expenditures. 
  Returning to supply, it is desirable for the country itself 
to manufacture everything needed for transport. It is our task 
to make certain all of that is in production, so that transport 
workers could acquire it. Secondly, we must create financial 
conditions for freight and passenger transport. After all, at 
present the tariffs are such that few can pay them. Right now, 
for instance, the shipment of a tonne of broken stone by railway 
is more expensive than its production. The same applies to 
concrete and much else. We are assisting building material 
enterprises with shipments, creating the most favorable 
conditions for transport activity and finding sources to cover 
the expenditures. 
  In aviation at the present time there are already over 30 
firms engaged in transport operations. We do not need the 
economic operation of Zhulyan, we want to transfer that airport 
to Kiev. But we do issue the operating license and the 
certificate, determine the degree of competence of personnel, 
and whether equipment meets established standards, and we also 
license various types of activity. After all, the process of 
transportation is a process presenting increased danger. Every 
transporter would like to see himself as far away from the 
ministry as possible. But people seek protection from us along 
with state justice. We must create equal conditions for everyone. 
  During my tenure I have never issued a single order for 
Rechflot. We worked out tariffs and fees for transiting canals, 
which, by the way, do not go to us at all. Rechflot, however, 
earns income from its vessels. While the Danube Steamship 
Company is responsible for the state of the Danube navigable 
channel and the ministry works with it. We prepare operating 
rules in accordance with world requirements and establish safety 
standards. 
  [Mayevskyy] City transport systems are under your 
jurisdiction. As you can understand, people have a special 
interest in them. 
  [Klympush] As strange as it may sound, city transport has, 
of 
course, lowered its standards, but far from the way everything 
else has gone down in our case. We are attempting to support all 
of that with whatever strength we have. In speaking about 
transport in general, it is necessary, first of all, to remember 
that prices for diesel fuel have increased here by a factor of 
200,000. Please note--not by a factor of two or 20, but by a 
factor of 200,000! This is what causes the large expenditures 
and unbearable prices. Subways, by the way, with a clear 
understanding of their importance by the city administrations of 
Kiev and Kharkov as well as by the government, have received an 
adequate budget, and are operating at a normal level. Motor 
transport, 20 percent of which was formerly renewed every year, 
is suffering. No new buses have now been purchased for four 
years. The current fare of 100 coupons covers 3-4 percent of the 
actual transportation cost. The rest must be compensated by 
someone. At the same time, 28 categories of people in our case 
eat free of charge. I am in favor of pensioners having benefits. 
But it turns out that they do not have these benefits in the 
countryside. Instead of tokens, people should be compensated for 
transportation with money, a certain sum. That would be fair. 
  [Mayevskyy] Have you been working in transportation for a 
long time? 
  [Klympush] All of my life. I am 53 years old. I graduated 
from the Road Transport Institute in Kiev with distinction, and 
did postgraduate work but left on my own to work in production. 
After acquiring experience in production, I returned to 
post-graduate studies and defended a dissertation. Then I 
progressed from an engineer to a director elected by the people 
at the Scientific Research Institute of Transport. 
Simultaneously I was also director of the scientific-research 
association that ensured technical progress and elaborated 
transport systems. I was ready for work and understood transport 
as a comprehensive system. 
  [Mayevskyy] How about your private life? 
  [Klympush] I am married. My wife is a speech therapist and 
works at the pedagogical institute; my daughter is a student. I 
have not had a vacation in two years. I frequently work 
Saturdays and Sundays. At one time I enjoyed mountain skiing and 
urged creation of a combined Ukrainian team--after all, I was 
born below Goverla. 
  [Mayevskyy] My God! I though I knew you from somewhere. You 
were a well-known mountain skier, and I still remember your 
name. It was bothering me. 
  [Klympush] On 8 March I visited my home during the election 
campaign. Recalling my youth, I made some runs on the mountain. 
That gave me a lot of pleasure. 
  [Mayevskyy] You were elected a people's deputy. Will that 
mean more work for you? 
  [Klympush] Yes. There are many problems. Transition to new 
methods took place with us, but it is necessary to organize 
transport under conditions of a market economy. Right now we 
have an economy in a state of transition. It is important to 
resolve the problem of ownership in transport in a clear-cut 
manner. In aviation and the river fleet, we are proceeding with 
auctions. But railways and highways must remain state-owned. 
With regard to the highways, it is necessary to designate some 
that may be auctioned and some that have strict government usage. 
  In many areas we must decentralize, relinquish the right to 
determine costs and tariffs in the oblast to the local level, 
but programs for development of the means of transportation, 
adjustment of production, and production of railway cars and 
electric and diesel locomotives, as well as shipbuilding should 
be handled by the ministry. 
  The production of the means of transportation, in our view, 
is a link that may be used to pull the entire chain. Aircraft, 
motor vehicles, and vessels represent the highest technical 
level in the entire industry. Their financing would help in the 
area of electronics, metallurgy, output of mechanical rubber 
products, machine building, as well as the raw material 
branches--everyone would have constant orders to fill. At the 
same time, the products may be sold both domestically and 
abroad. We work together with many ministries. Questions of 
standardization, certification, licensing of the means of 
transportation and transport activity--these are new areas of 
work representing main elements in the activity of the ministry. 
We are working on airports, railway stations, and bus stations. 
We are developing high-speed main lines so that a train could 
travel to Odessa, Kharkov, and Lvov in two to three hours, and 
to Simferopol in five hours. We requested that oblast 
administrations not occupy land areas where high-speed main 
lines may be built. The Aviation Code worked out by us and the 
law on road traffic have already been prepared, and railway 
transport regulations and the law on transport have also been 
submitted. All of these are standardization documents necessary 
in society. We are working together with the world community and 
have concluded more than 55 international and intergovernmental 
agreements on the interaction of various types of transport and 
coordination of rules. We are conducting a state policy in the 
area of transportation. In the long term we will be involved in 
the building of the trans-European railway, with construction 
from the western border to Kiev--some 770 kilometers of 
high-quality tracks, with all of the required infrastructure 
along both sides. Three million people work in our branch, and 
we are trying to do everything possible for them. 
  [Mayevskyy] I wish you much success and thank you for the 
interview.

  [Text] It has been announced that a national stock holding 
company, "Ukrnaftohaz", is to be formed by June 1 of this year 
by order of the President of Ukraine. In addition, Yevhen 
Sukhin, the CEO of "Ukrnaftohaz" and first deputy chief of the 
State Oil and Gas Committee, informed the Ukrainian and foreign 
press about the formation of the National Stock Holding Company 
of Ukraine (NSHCU). NSHCU will deal in oil and gas enterprises 
that have been targeted for incorporation and privatization. 
These include "Ukrhazprom", "Ukrnafta", "Ukrzakordonnaftohazbud" 
and a number of other enterprises. 
  The primary goal of NSHCU is to secure investments to 
promote 
rapid reorganization and to cover foreign energy debts. Payments 
will be in the form of shares rather than tangible goods as 
proposed by some foreign suppliers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch: "Chernobyl AES </F>
Has to be Closed"] 
  [Text]Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch, chairman of the last 
session of parliament and a candidate for Ukrainian presidency, 
met with various journalists, including Mykhaylo Prylutskyy, 
editor-in-chief of ZELENYY SVIT. 
  The questions covered the entire gamut of problems in 
Ukraine: politics, economics, state-building, industry, 
agriculture, energy, market finances, banking, taxes, mafia, and 
corruption. Obviously, the upcoming presidential elections 
were also addressed. 
  ZELENYY SVIT, however, concentrated on Plyusch's response to 
the following question: 
  The previous session of the parliament--under your 
leadership--declared a moratorium on the construction of new 
nuclear power reactors and passed a resolution advocating the 
closing of the Chernobyl AES (CAES). A year later, still under 
your leadership, the moratorium was lifted, the resolution 
rescinded, and ongoing operation of CAES was allowed. The 
"Greens" feel that this reversal was in response to pressure 
from the nuclear lobby. How do you really feel about this 
painful problem in view of the worldwide trend to curtail 
expansion of nuclear power? 
  I would like to be better understood on this point and will 
go somewhat back in history. 
  In 1975 I had just started working in the Kiev Obkom as 
deputy of the Agricultural Department and was sent to Chernobyl 
to attend a rayon party conference. Prypyat did not yet exist. 
However, graphite components were already being installed at the 
first reactor. By a circuitous route--since I was not on the 
`approved' list--I managed to get inside and view the huge 
constructions taking place. 
  Later I met Anatoliy Petrovych Aleksandrov when he assumed 
presidency of the USSR Academy of Sciences. I was charged with 
escorting him by the first secretary when he visited Tarashcha 
and Fastiv--the sites of his youth. He attempted to convince me 
that other fuels will soon be obsolete and science will provide 
us with such small reactors that you could use them for home 
heating. Ten years later, ironically enough, ovens in villages 
contaminated by radiation were called reactors. 
  At that time the Kharkiv and Odesa ATETs were in the 
planning 
stages: these were to be nuclear thermoelectric centers from 
which hot water would be pumped directly to heat homes. What 
could be more efficient? 
  And then the CAES accident! I was there on the first day and 
rode in the same car with academician Valeriy Legasov, now 
deceased, Mykola Shcherbyna, head of the Government Commission, 
and Mykola Nikolayev, deputy chairman of the USSR Council of 
Ministers. 
  We arrived in Chernobyl at five and the commission met at 
seven. Legasov was one of the few nuclear experts who even at 
that time--April 26--clearly said "I don't know how the ruined 
reactor will behave tomorrow. Water is being discharged. Where 
does it flow? I recommend immediate evacuation..." 
  Whatever you may hear, believe only this: evacuation was to 
be implemented not to protect people from contamination with 
radionuclides, but from the possibility of something far worse, 
a nuclear explosion! 
  But who would approve an evacuation? It was Saturday and the 
highest government official that Shcherbyna managed to reach was 
Dolgikh. Gorbachev called back after ten from his car on his way 
home from a theater. We left the room and Shcherbyna talked with 
him one-on-one... 
  The Ukrainian government and Central Committee--objects of 
so 
much vituperation--had by this time sent 1200 buses to 
Chernobyl, even though permission to evacuate had not been 
granted. At eleven at night Shcherbyna informed us that a 
decision would be made tomorrow at ten in the morning, April 27. 
  The commission was to meet at ten. I, as head of the Kiev 
Executive Committee, met with the local officials at nine. 
Shcherbyna learned that we discussed evacuation, ordered me to 
appear before him and said: "Ivan, I alone am the head of the 
commission and the rest of you are mere members." I had a lot of 
explaining to do. 
  It was then that I began to understand the atom. 
  In Niagara Falls there is a gallery of the painter Vasyl 
Kurylyk, a Canadian of Ukrainian descent. He was born to a farm 
family who emigrated to Canada long before the Soviet revolution 
and had nothing to do with bourgeois Ukrainian nationalism which 
has been used to frighten us for such a long time. It took him a 
long time to become an artist and the road was difficult. After 
a serious illness he had a vision and began to create paintings 
on religious themes and works on saving the earth from a nuclear 
catastrophe. 
  As a villager I was struck by one of his paintings of a 
cabbage patch in which the heads did not have a solitary leaf. 
They looked like human skulls. In the distance on the left you 
could discern the dome of a church, and on the right a rising 
dome of a nuclear explosion. 
  When I asked the tour guide when it was painted I was 
shocked 
by the answer: 1971. That's when construction of CAES began! 
  Thinking about this painting convinced me that nuclear 
energy 
is a satanic force and humanity would be much better off without 
it. But it is here ... it happened ... 
  Now we must deal with nuclear safety and energy needs. Many 
economists hold that every country possesses enough energy 
resources its needs. However, Ukrainian gas and oil were very 
quickly expended on supplying the rest of the huge USSR. For 
example, the Dashavskyy gas fields heated all of Leningrad. The 
same happened with our oil which was wasted, although it could 
have been used for production of goods much more valuable than 
fuel. The operating philosophy was: Let's use up what you have 
and then everyone for himself! 
  Ukraine still has large reserves of nuclear fuel and this, 
unfortunately, provides a strong temptation to build more 
nuclear reactors. Besides nuclear, Ukraine still has enough 
other energy resources to meet fifty percent of its energy 
needs. There are countries that can only meet four percent of 
their needs from their own energy resources, but they haven't 
gone nuclear. 
  Many energy experts don't seem to understand that nuclear 
power is not cost effective, contrary to popular assertions. 
  One of the few that understood this reality was Vitaliy 
Sklyarov, the former--regrettably--Ukrainian Minister of Energy. 
While not in charge of CAES, he spent many of the most dangerous 
days there and wrote "Chernobyl Tomorrow", an excellent book. 
His economic analysis should cool off the fervent advocates of 
the plutonium industry and nuclear weapons. He did not emigrate 
nor acquire millions as his detractors asserted to undermine his 
credibility. 
  If we want to put our nuclear house in order we must 
immediately reinstate Sklyarov as Minister of Energy. He has an 
extraordinary grasp of energy problems. If, on the contrary, we 
create a closed loop of nuclear reactors Ukraine will be faced 
with a tremendous economic burden. 
  We have to proceed on a parallel course: use nuclear energy 
for the time being and develop alternative energy sources. 
  What is my attitude to the CAES? I spent 78 days there when 
we needed to close it down and then restart it. I know many of 
the staff and understand their collective psychology. CAES must 
be closed down, but in a sensible manner that takes our current 
energy situation into account. 
  CAES has to be shut down in cooperation with the European 
community and all governmental bureaus have to be involved, 
including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We have to turn to 
our neighbors for help. Chernobyl is a global catastrophe that 
has to be managed jointly. 
  I addressed this issue at the UN conference on the 
environment in Rio-de-Janeiro in 1992. The conference was 
attended by representatives of 118 countries including such 
figures as Bush, Mitterand, and Majors ... the best presentation 
was given by Castro. Only Cuba, itself in dire straits, rendered 
assistance in the health care of our children. No wonder we have 
a saying "The poorer, the kinder!" 
  The European community forgot about Chernobyl very quickly. 
But, as I told Mr. Marshall [sic], an English 
parliamentarian--he is in charge of Chernobyl and had visited 
there--you don't seem to realize that, as Sklyarov wrote, 
Chernobyl "is and will be tomorrow's problem." 
  Mr. Marshall has recently become active in trying to 
interest 
the world community in our common problems. 
  I would prefer to avoid recriminations, but it needs to be 
said that the attitude of MAGATE to Chernobyl and its 
consequences lacks objectivity. They attempt to convince the 
world that nothing very terrible happened at Chernobyl. At the 
meeting in Strassbourg when the "Children of Chernobyl" program 
was being reviewed, the MAGATE representative tried to convince 
everyone that there is no medical evidence that it is dangerous 
for children to live in Kiev. When I rose and said "There are 70 
of you here. Who of you would like to live in Kiev with your 
grandchildren?" everyone laughed but not a single hand went up. 
  Chernobyl, along with Donbas and Kryvbas, are like a yoke 
around our neck and take up forty percent of the Ukrainian 
budget. Even a rich country could not manage that, and yet we 
are alone with our burden. 
  ZELENYY SVIT and I share many views, including the need to 
shut down Chernobyl. But we must hurry at a rational, deliberate 
pace and enlist international cooperation. Some of the so-called 
Chernobyl social organizations--by their irresponsible 
actions--have compromised the very idea of helping the victims 
of the greatest nuclear disaster ever. 
  Chernobyl and pollution in Ukraine have moral and spiritual 
connotations in addition to ecological ramifications. To the 
extent that we are pure, healthy and strong in our national 
spirit, the sooner we will overcome our trials.

<F P=106> [Article by GUDOK correspondent A. Mudrakov, Kharkov: "The </F>
Arithmetic of Sloppy Work"] 
  [Text] It seems to have become a habit--no money, no fuel, 
no materials for track repairs, no this that and the other 
thing. This being so, why call anybody to account? Perhaps this 
is what A. Boldyr had in mind (he was the track supervisor on 
the Kupyansk Junction Division, but is no longer) when he was 
supervising repairs on a switch. 
  They installed new metal parts, but there wasn't much to 
think about regarding switch ties. There was not a single new 
set on the division, and the old ones were no good at all--five 
or eight in a row were rotten and untrustworthy. 
  In his report later, A. Boldyr would write: "I wasn't able 
to 
eliminate the cluster rot because there are ties or switch 
ties." However worried he might have been, however, the 
supervisor still opened the section to traffic. 
  A week later, Train No 238 from Moscow to Donetsk entered 
Kupyansk Junction. 
  An excerpt from engineer V. Kuzin's report: 
  "On passing the entry semaphore I used the service brake to 
slow to 9 km per hour. After the brakes were released while 
proceeding through the station, the speed was increased to 15 
kph. At that moment I heard a shunt in the train and applied the 
service brake. The train stopped immediately. I sent the 
assistant engineer to inspect the train. On returning he 
reported that three cars had left the rails" (as it turned out, 
four). 
  The cause of the derailment is simplicity itself: the 
inquiry 
found that after the switch was replaced, nobody weeded out the 
bad switch ties, and large sags were left in the track, 
resulting in widening of the gauge. 
  One would think someone ought to sound the alarm, and 
someone 
did... but only in the railroad office. The next day a telegram 
was sent to Kupyansk ordering immediate steps to eliminate the 
safety hazard--in particular, to promptly inspect the crossover 
and switch segments; to allow passenger trains only on the main 
tracks; to prohibit the replacement of switches without first 
weeding out bad ties and switch ties; and to consider the 
possibility of dismantling low-traffic yard tracks and switches 
and using them on main and receiving-shipping tracks. 
  But the message never got to the person it was addressed to, 
and so a new report: "During the receiving of Train No 170 on 
its way from Donetsk to Minsk, at 7:46 two cars were derailed 
due to widening of the tracks." Where do you think it was? At 
switch No 25 again! Truly, disasters don't come singly. 
  Bad luck, perhaps? Well, no. The inquiry reveals otherwise. 
During repairs to the tracks following the derailment of Train 
No 238, S. Starorublevtsev, the acting chief of Division 15, and 
L. Stupakov, the NODP [Division Chief of Line Services] of the 
Kupyansk Department, who had been ordered to get the necessary 
work done, were guilty of outrageous negligence. The rail 
support segment of the switch curve at switch No 25 had been 
spiked without installing standard reinforcement plates, and the 
bad switch ties had not been completely weeded out (that lesson 
sure didn't take). After the track was opened to traffic nothing 
was done to monitor the track's condition. In other words, 
really slipshod work. 
  Yet none of the persons involved were novices. Track 
supervisor A. Boldyr has been working on the railroad for 19 
years, and he has a reputation as an intelligent, industrious, 
specialist who gets the job done. S. Starorublevtsev, L. 
Stupakov, and acting track foreman T. Chepurko have plenty of 
experience. Yet the accident was the logical result of each 
one's negligence. 
  A week before the accident, the track measurer had reported 
sloppy work at the same place, switch No 25. The switch was 
closed to traffic, but all the track supervisor did was 
eliminate a 5-degree gauge deviation in the butt of the stock 
rail and didn't check further. 
  S. Starorublevtsev failed to follow up on the correction of 
gross deviations in maintenance of the switch assembly or to see 
that the work was done properly. NODP L. Stupakov, who had 
accompanied the track measurer, on his return did not inquire as 
to the cause of the unsatisfactory assessment of the maintenance 
of the switch, and failed to take measures to rectify it. His 
report includes this passage: "No one notified me to take 
measures"--a rather naive statement for a senior NODP. 
  There can be only one conclusion. Track measurement and 
inspection is strictly a formality on divisions of the Kupyansk 
Junction. 
  On the Kupyansk Junction division, at least, every alarm 
warning should have been taken seriously; people still remember 
very well what happened at the Mokhnach station in August 1991, 
when passenger train No 228 had an accident due to similar 
causes. 
  Of course, things are tough for everyone these 
days--finances 
have been cut to the limit, repair materials are lacking, and 
crews are undermanned. Under such conditions, though, extra 
vigilance is called for, and every effort to prevent accidents. 
  Now for a little arithmetic. Putting the cars back on track 
cost 1,880,480 karbovantsy [Ukrainian rubles], repairs to them 
cost 8,779,006. Two switches cost 57,205. Labor costs were about 
135,913. It all adds up to about 11 million karbovantsy. 
  And that's just one incident, but surely not the only one on 
the Southern Railroad. Maybe the reason we're not getting paid 
on time, and funds are short for everything, is that sloppy 
workmanship is wasting millions.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Samsonenko: "Demonopolization"] </F>
  [Text] A three-day anti-monopoly meeting in Kiev on May 24 
was attended by representatives of most of the CIS and central 
European countries. 
  The foundations for this meeting were laid in Moscow on 
March 
12, 1993, by heads of the CIS member states who signed an 
anti-monopoly agreement. A few months later CIS representatives 
met to set the appropriate guidelines. Another meeting in Almaty 
on October 15, 1993, dealt with legal imperfections in the 
Moscow agreement and lack of coordination. Basic principles for 
competition and integration were set forth in Ashhabad on 
December 23, 1993: the CIS representatives agreed on 
anti-monopoly policies and establishment of an Interstate 
Council. 
  In opening the conference Oleksander Zavada, head of the 
Ukrainian Anti-Monopoly Committee, noted that the Kiev forum was 
the best attended and included Eastern European representatives. 
He underscored the fact that the purpose of the meeting was to 
enhance cooperation in anti-monopoly policies among the CIS 
members and develop analogous relationships with Baltic and East 
European countries. 
  Since all the countries shared a common economic system in 
the recent past, there is great need for such coordination, 
particularly where international trade is involved. To that end, 
Ukraine had initiated this meeting to coordinate anti-monopoly 
measures and safeguard entrepreneurs and consumers alike. This 
was particularly important because of expansion of the 
activities of trans-national corporation. 
  While Zavada agreed that the experience of Russia or some 
Eastern European countries may not have been too impressive, 
Ukraine must take their experience into account when formulating 
its anti-monopoly policies because of their encounters with 
market economy problems and monopolistic practices. Moreover, 
Ukraine has already implemented over three hundred anti-monopoly 
measures and has created a corresponding legal framework to 
support them. It is important for Ukraine that these laws fit in 
with the rest of Ukrainian jurisprudence. 
  The meeting culminated with the signing of the appropriate 
documents of understanding, integration and implementation among 
the CIS members, Baltic states and Eastern European countries. 
In addition, the Interstate Council considered methodological 
ramifications of cooperation in light of individual national 
laws. 
  The meeting ratified a memorandum issued by the Interstate 
Council to the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly entitled 
"Concordance of National Anti-Monopoly Laws with the 
Anti-Monopoly Agreement Signed by CIS Heads of State at Ashhabad 
on December 23, 1993." Leonid Bochyn, head of the Interstate 
Council and of the Russian State Committee on Anti-Monopoly 
Policy, has characterized the memorandum as being important 
because it calls for concordance of anti-monopoly laws, passage 
of applicable laws by parliaments of CIS member states, and 
creation of enforcing agencies.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Stanislav Shushkevich, ex-chairman </F>
of the Supreme Soviet of Belorussia, by Lyubov Bazan; place and 
date not given: "'I Love Stanislav'"] 
  [Text] Belorussia [Belarus] is preparing for 
presidential elections. One candidate for this office is 
Stanislav Shushkevich, ex-chairman of the Supreme Soviet of 
Belorussia, who chatted with a ROSSIYA correspondent and shared 
his thoughts concerning the country's present and future. 
  My recall from the office of chairman of the Supreme Soviet 
was nothing more than a well-staged political intrigue. I cannot 
agree and never will agree with the reasons that allegedly 
brought about my dismissal. The charge of corruption is a clever 
and skillful lie. The true reasons for my dismissal go deeper, 
of course. My disagreements with the majority of the Supreme 
Soviet came to light long since, in the first months of business 
even. And in the final period the conformist deputies of the 
supreme legislative body no longer bothered to keep up a "good," 
democratic appearance even. My entire activity in the office of 
chairman was a succession of compromises in the name of the 
solution of fundamental questions making it possible to look for 
progress in the development of the republic. In a situation of 
constant opposition my main task was, perhaps, to push through 
as many laws as possible making the process of transformations 
irreversible. I went along with much for the sake of this, but 
the differences with the nomenklatura majority of the Supreme 
Soviet were too serious. My resignation from the office of 
chairman does not mean that I have renounced political struggle. 
Now, when the government and the Supreme Soviet have brought the 
republic to the most severe economic crisis, I believe that to 
quit politics would be irresponsible. 
  The very low level of political literacy of the population 
is 
a dangerous symptom. 
  Events could begin to develop in unpredictable fashion, 
especially since the republic has, truly, been reduced to a 
deplorable condition and many people have lost all bearings as 
to what is going on. 
  Many people like simple, more precisely, primitive, 
speeches, 
but not everyone wishes to think about what follows them. One 
presidential candidate, for example, Aleksandr Lukashenko, 
proposes the same simple and eye-catching solutions for all 
problems as V. Zhirinovskiy in Russia. Without military pushes 
to the Indian Ocean, it is true, but the rest is the same. 
  The instability in society is being stoked by inflation, 
which is running at 50-60 percent a month. 
  The needy and the retirees are suffering particularly. How 
can the state protect them? After all, we have to have something 
in order to be able to give it out. There's nothing to be gotten 
from an empty pocket, and Belorussia's pocket is now empty. 
Structural reforms and privatization are needed, but how is all 
this to happen? 
  The Belorussia People's Movement, which has nominated as 
presidential candidates A. Lukashenko and V. Novikov, secretary 
of the Party of Communists of Belorussia, is enjoying success in 
the indoctrination of the electorate against the background of 
the impoverishment of the people. They are promising everything, 
and all at once, what is more: the restoration of order, a fight 
against corruption, wages for all who want them. Aside from this 
populist demagogy and the customary promises of a "bright 
tomorrow," the Belorussia People's Movement is preaching 
postulates that are fraught with serious complications with 
other states of the CIS, primarily with Russia. It is sufficient 
to mention the rhetoric concerning the building of Belorussian 
socialism or the restoration of the USSR according to the 
prescriptions of the Moscow red-brown opposition. And S. 
Gaydukevich, chairman of the Belorussia People's Movement, is 
declaring publicly that other winds will shortly be blowing from 
Moscow. It is the needy and socially unprotected strata of 
society that are becoming the social base of these forces, 
unfortunately. 
  Very characteristic of Belorussia today are charges against 
the democrats, who have "reduced".... But permit me to ask: 
Where in Belorussia are there democrats? And how could they have 
"reduced" anything if they have not yet held power even? 
  The party apparatus and the nomenklatura are the basis of 
the 
present government and Supreme Soviet. Party officials of all 
ranks, who were swept from their positions by the events of 
August 1991, have come to head all local government--oblast, 
city, and rayon--authorities. These people are continuing to do 
what they have done their whole lives: to solicit credit and 
then to distribute it, stealing in large and varying amounts. 
  In a normal society responsibility for what is happening in 
the state is borne by the government. With us, however, some 
mythical democrats are to blame for all misfortunes. 
  I have always opposed a vetting act and I do not believe 
that, had it been adopted in Belorussia, as in certain 
postcommunist states of East Europe and the Baltic, we would 
have avoided the crisis. I am convinced that no person should 
bear the stigma of his past activity because this was legitimate 
activity. A person is entitled to any ideological convictions, 
communist included. The Belorussian People's Front has always 
insisted on a vetting act, I do not share this opinion. 
  Such is my approach also to the national question, which has 
engendered tumultuous processes in many post-Soviet republics. 
Those who want to impose Belorussian by extremist methods are 
hardly doing Belorussia or this language any service. Everything 
should develop naturally, not forcibly, we should avoid only 
adopting any decrees. The Belorussian people are, generally, 
very tolerant, and now, against the background of the ongoing 
national battles in other countries of the CIS, and not only of 
the CIS, Belorussia could set an example of interethnic 
relations. 
  If I am elected president, I shall begin, I believe, with 
three most important matters. 
  First, I shall dismiss all the industrial manager-ministers. 
The time for empty prattle is past. People with market thinking 
and education who have no connection with the party school of 
the Communist Party of Belorussia Central Committee must, 
finally, assume the positions of the ministers connected with 
economics, finances, agriculture, and foreign economic relations. 
  Second, the privatization of everything subject to 
privatization is essential. There can be no more demagogy on 
this problem, and the creeping nomenklatura "plunderization," at 
which the Soviet authorities have become so adopt over these 
years, must end. 
  And, of course, elections for a new Supreme Soviet. The 13th 
Supreme Soviet of the Belorussian SSR--and it is this that is 
still operative in its full composition of 300 people's deputies 
elected in USSR times even--can no longer remain the supreme 
legislative body of the republic.

"The Longest Train"] 
  [Text] The first of the radically new DRB1 diesel trains 
has started running on the Polotsk-Vitebsk-Zaolsha section of 
the Belarusian Mainline. 
  Unlike its sister trains, manufactured in series in Riga, it 
consists of 10 rather than six cars. They are all trailer cars, 
and they use two 2M62 diesel units instead of motor cars, one at 
the front and one at the back. Including the design, it cost the 
railroad 1.1 million dollars--one third cheaper than the usual 
DR1A twin-diesel train also manufactured by the Riga plant. But 
there are other advantages too. 
  "The motor cars being produced in Latvia now," says deputy 
railroad chief V. Nazarenko, "are pulled by diesels obtained 
from a defense plant, and they are designed for a short service 
life, without repairs. So in five years the frame wears out and 
cannot be rebuilt. During a diesel train's normal 20-year 
service life, then, the engines will have to be replaced several 
times. Costwise this is equivalent to buying a new train. The 
hydraulic transmission is also unreliable, loses a lot of oil 
and takes a lot of labor to repair." 
  Almost half of the railroad's diesel train fleet has been in 
operation over 20 years. But they still have to be kept in use, 
despite the costs of repairing and maintaining this type of 
rolling stock, because the new Riga diesel train costs 750,000 
dollars, and a German make costs five times that. The railroad 
can't afford that right now. 
  The use of Riga-made trailer cars driven by a 2M62 diesel 
does much to alleviate the shortage of commuter trains, 
especially considering that the sharp decline in freight haulage 
has made about 30 percent of such locomotives available. And 
although they need to be modernized, at least it makes things 
much less costly. 
  The new diesel train has a number of other attractive 
features. In a stock train the cars are heated with hot air 
delivered directly from the motor car's engine room; the new one 
uses a combined method--heaters under the seats run off the 
locomotive's generator, and additional heat comes from a special 
air unit using heat from the diesel. The cars are lighted by a 
radically new system. In a stock diesel train, electricity for 
the lights comes from the starter generator with the motor 
running; in the new make, it is provided by an independent unit. 
Each car has a toilet and a 250-liter hot-water tank. 
  Still, it isn't only the new train's technical specs that 
account for its appearance on the Belarusian Mainline; rather, 
it's the acute shortage of commuter trains owing to rising 
passenger traffic the past while. Earlier, the bus network 
accommodated 95 percent of the republic's communities; this year 
the number of bus runs on the routes has dropped to barely a 
quarter. On the remaining routes the fare has gone up so much 
that it's too much of a burden for a lot of people. Accordingly, 
riders who used to take the bus have swelled the ranks of train 
passengers. Basically these are workers who have to commute from 
the suburbs to the major industrial centers, also persons who 
commute to vacation spots and to their garden plots. Passenger 
traffic has risen abruptly by almost 60 percent over 1990. And 
the full brunt fell to the commuter trains--yet the train fleet 
has remained almost the same size in the three years. The cars 
are so full an apple wouldn't have room to fall. 
  In view of all this, the railroad's management asked 
specialists of the Riga Railcar Plant to examine the technical 
possibility of using 2M62 diesel units to drive 8- to 10-car 
trains. They endorsed the idea, and immediately the partners 
concluded a trilateral contract with a research and development 
firm which was based in the old Riga branch of the All-Union 
Scientific-Research Institute for Railcar Building. In a short 
time a project was designed by which the plant built 10 trailer 
cars and refurbished a diesel locomotive sent by the Belarusians. 
  The first operational tests of the new diesel train in Riga 
was attended by specialists from the Polotsk Locomotive Depot, 
headed by its chief, S. Bokhan. Incidentally, they acted so 
professionally in dealing with the problems of adjusting the 
additional equipment installed on the locomotive that they 
earned high marks from the manufacturers. 
  Then the breaking-in tests were run on the 
Polotsk-Krulevshchizna and Polotsk-Bigosovo sections, and they 
confirmed the reliability of all the new train's systems. In 
late April it carried its first passengers, after which the 
train served sections between Polotsk and Glubokoye, Postavy, 
and Vitebsk. The equipment was broken in, and the locomotive 
crews learned the necessary skills. This was especially vital, 
because there are certain peculiarities in the train's 
operation. In particular, a second assistant engineer is needed 
on the rear unit. In addition, extra platforms had to be built 
at stops located on curved sections to permit observation of 
passenger loading and unloading--after all, it's a long train. 
Finally, the Polotsk Locomotive Depot has to provide facilities 
for the maintenance and repair of trailer cars and diesel units. 
  "We have estimated," V. Nazarenko said, "that sections 
having 
heavy peak-hour passenger traffic will need 60 to 70 of these 
long diesel trains; in other cases we can get by with short 
trains. If this firstborn of ours demonstrates its operational 
reliability, we can use the same technical principle to make 
five- and six-car diesel trains driven by just one unit. In that 
case, the lead car will be equipped with an engineer's cab to 
control the diesel unit attached to the end. The Riga people are 
willing to translate this idea into blueprints and metal. 
  "But we're also thinking about organizing the manufacture of 
trailer cars in our own republic. Belarus has an excellent 
machine-building and engineering potential. Right now, much of 
the industrial complex is working below capacity or even 
standing idle. Officials of Bobruyskfermmash, the big production 
association, have proposed to the head of the railroad and the 
State Committee for Industry and Intersectorial Facilities that 
they organize the manufacture of these cars in their own plants. 
They even went to Riga to familiarize themselves with the 
relevant technology. 
  "There is nothing especially complicated about this. 
Essentially, trailer cars are among the simplest kinds of 
rolling stock. They don't have boilers and heating pipes, 
generators, storage batteries, power switchboards, and coolers 
for drinking water and air conditioners. All these functions are 
provided in the motor car's engine room or, in our case, in the 
locomotive. Railroad Chief Ye. Volodko gave his OK to the idea, 
and the Gomel Giprozhivmash Institute is now working on 
converting the Bobruysk Agricultural Machine-Building Plant to a 
railcar-building plant. 
  "Of course, this 'reprofiling' will take a lot of financing, 
and the railroad isn't in a position to bear the burden by 
itself; the state budget will have to help...." 
  But, he who seeks will find. And the Belarusian Mainline has 
offered to make its own contribution by using its own resources 
to lay tracks on the territory of its future partner--if the 
reprofiling really gets underway. Time will tell how things go. 
Perhaps other railroad people in republics of the CIS will get 
involved and contribute their bit.

<F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Marina Vartanyan: "Return </F>
to Yerevan--1994"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Armenia: So--What Is Going On There, Anyway?!" </H5>
  A great many different things are being said in Moscow today 
about Yerevan. That street warfare is taking place there. That 
people are dropping on the sidewalks in full daylight from 
hunger. That they have chopped down all the trees and are 
burning the wood in their stoves. 
  As an eyewitness and direct participant in Yerevan life, let 
me testify that life is not horrible in the city. Bombs are not 
exploding in the streets, although entirely peaceful border 
regions just a few dozen kilometers away (on the border with 
Azerbaijan) are indeed subjected to bombardment almost daily, 
and one can sometimes hear cannon fire in the very suburbs of 
the Armenian capital. 
  People are not dropping on the sidewalks en masse from 
hunger, although there are hunger-caused fainting spells--the 
menu of the average Yerevan resident, living statistically on 80 
cents a month (!), would certainly elicit shock even from the 
citizen of Russia, who has seen quite a bit himself. The 
shooting on the streets is no more frequent than in Moscow, and 
"this shooting is not of the military variety, but results from 
business disputes, or in the most extreme cases--from 'internal 
political' disagreement." 
  What is indeed strange is the fact that one can quietly get 
on a bus in the morning, or stop by a large department store or 
the marketplace, and wind up leaving it under military escort, 
finding oneself a couple of hours later at some military unit 
under full military gear, with the most "unforeseeable 
consequences" in store for the near future. This is the original 
procedure we now have for effecting the spring call-up of our 
green youth and "reservists." And we thought certain methods of 
"social work" had been relegated to the past. No way--Homo 
soveticus is today alive and well! 
  Then too, our life in Yerevan has certain quite evident 
advantages. Consider "Herbalife," for example--an expensive 
deal, and not without its side effects, they say, especially 
judging from the intensity of the advertisements. 
  In Yerevan, all these contrivances are unnecessary. 
Weight-watcher groups are operating quite effectively and have a 
clientele totalling just about a million people. I have tried 
them myself. In just over a year on one of these diets, your 
correspondent managed to lose almost 20 kilograms, moving out of 
two sizes--first "super-large," then "large." And there were no 
ill effects, by the way. 
  Or consider the "Running Staircase" training apparatus. It 
occupies first place on the list of American home sports 
equipment. Incidentally, this machine costs fifteen hundred 
bucks. And it has never occurred to the Americans that they 
could save this entire amount--you just have to find a friend on 
the 15th or 16th floor of any city high-rise and walk up the 
stairs to visit him every day. Or you could move to this floor 
yourself and not use the elevator--not because there is no 
electricity, but purely for exercise. You get precisely the 
desired effect--this too I have tried myself. 
  Yerevan residents have an advantage here that no amount of 
bucks elsewhere can provide--they often have to make this trip 
upstairs in pitch darkness, with a candle, sometimes carrying a 
bucket of water, which naturally enhances the physical training 
effect.... 
  In short, we are surviving. To understand just how, read the 
following and judge for yourself. 
<H5>  What Do We Smell in the Smoke of the Motherland? </H5>
  According to a variety of estimates, more than 300,000 
people left Armenia last year alone. It is not difficult to 
conjecture what this means for the 3 million living in the 
republic. 
  Last winter (1993), one could smell anything and everything 
in the "smoke of the Motherland." At that time we had virtually 
the first Yerevan winter since the beginning of the blockade 
WITHOUT ANYTHING--no light, gas, heat, fuel, regular food.... 
Yerevan residents were not quite ready for this, and they burned 
everything they managed to come across in the pot-belly stoves 
placed in window apertures. You cannot imagine what "went up in 
smoke"--issues of OGONEK carefully saved up until now along with 
post-perestroyka materials on the history of Russia that people 
were unfamiliar with. They shredded NOVYY MIR, with Solzhenitsyn 
and other lamenting emigrants, to feed the stove. They burned 
tire covers, footwear, old clothing--just to be able to warm up, 
boil a little water.... 
  This winter (1994), those who remained in Yerevan waved 
good-bye to everything and as summer passed stocked up on their 
supply of decent stoves and, most importantly, of anything that 
could be burned in them. Not a single piece of paper, packet, or 
box of matches was discarded at home. And vehicles carrying 
kerosene and firewood came into the cities. The firewood was 
sometimes "locally produced," sometimes "imported." The 
authorities quickly assessed the situation and prohibited local 
chopping of wood. The price of a cubic meter of firewood then 
jumped to $45 as early as the end of autumn, reached $70 at the 
start of winter, then in the severe cold reached $80-$120 for a 
cubic meter of split wood. 
  The meager ration (mainly of bread and culinary products 
contrived from it that are rather strange to the outsider, 
potatoes, and cereal) is perhaps not so bad for adults watching 
their weight, but is of course entirely unsuitable for children. 
And indeed, in no way can all Armenian families purchase even a 
little firewood or kerosene, since the true average wage in 
Armenia is no greater than 350 drams--this winter this was on 
the order of $1.50. 
  As a result, as springtime approached hundreds of people 
found themselves on the brink of physical exhaustion and 
psychologically stressed. Many decided they would throw 
everything away and leave. Restless lines of refugees with their 
belongings stretched around the train stations and airports, in 
numbers greater than the emigration waves during the days of 
genocide. 
  We sometimes hear that it is not 300,000, but rather 800,000 
who left--which we would greatly like to believe is an 
exaggeration. The prospects are entirely real, however: One more 
winter like that, and the flight from Armenia of her own 
people--desperate, at breakneck speed--will take on truly 
catastrophic proportions, with entirely predictable consequences. 
  There are precedents, unfortunately. In neighboring Turkey, 
just a few dozen kilometers from Yerevan, stretches a vast, 
woeful wasteland with the ruins and skeletons of majestic 
Christian temples, of Ani, capital of the ancient, powerful 
Armenian kingdom, whose people were forced into exile. Today no 
one lives here or in the fairly large territory adjoining the 
former capital city. From time to time Kurdish herdsmen drive 
their livestock here to graze. 
  The task of halting the flight of Armenia's own people out 
of 
the country is today acquiring the scope of a task of state 
proportions. There are various ways of accomplishing it, the 
least productive of which are debates resounding from the 
rostrums of diverse levels of pomp and authority. The most 
productive consist of direct material assistance to the families 
who reside today in Armenia. 
<H5>  Who in the Final Analysis Are the Greater Capitalists--the </H5>
"Misters" or the "Comrades"? 
  The political picture of Armenia is striking today in 
its diversity.... and in the virtual indifference of its main 
figures and groups to the true crisis situation that has taken 
shape in the republic. 
  At the same time, entrepreneurs are emerging in the 
political 
arena. And it probably should be this way. Because it is they 
who are today feeding the country to a significant degree, 
delivering assortments of essential products and consumer goods, 
while the state specializes only in bread, throwing out a stick 
of butter or package of sugar or cereal from time to time to the 
starving consumer. It is the entrepreneurs who are penetrating 
the blockade and delivering their goods to those regions that 
are engulfed in flame. It is they who are the first real doves 
of peace negotiations--insofar as methods of people's diplomacy, 
tried and true, bring trade to the border regions, and do so 
rather successfully. 
  So it is. In this situation you would not even wish your 
enemy to be positioned on today's Armenian political Mount 
Olympus. But he who is there is forced to tow the mark. More 
than a dozen parliamentary party factions and groups sit there 
and defend their factional interests session after session with 
a stubbornness that could be put to far better use. 
  Thus, a situation fairly traditional for the CIS countries 
has today taken shape in Armenia, in which the standing of the 
main political forces is not simply poor--the very concept of 
"political party" elicits an unambiguous negative reaction from 
residents. Against this background (also characteristic of many 
regions of the CIS), the communists have received definite 
dividends, simply as a certain homogeneous group evoking 
nostalgic memories in many people of the Soviet way of life. But 
even these gourmet feelings are not strong enough to justify 
serious discussion of any enhanced standing of the Communist 
Party in Armenia. 
  In contrast to most other regions of the CIS, there are in 
Armenia the so-called "traditional" parties, i.e., entirely real 
political forces which, during the period when the single-party 
system reigned in the USSR, existed, developed, and replenished 
their ranks and influence in the Armenian diaspora. Following 
certain events, they simply "moved" to local territory--to 
Armenia. 
  Two main parties are worthy of note when discussing 
traditional Armenian parties--the "Ramkavar," or liberal 
democrats (in no way to be confused with the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia]--two very different entities), and 
"Dashnaktsutyun"--a socialist-oriented Armenian party whose 
members address one another through conviction as 
"comrade," no less. A contradiction has arisen here on the 
question of the anticrisis programs of these parties, referred 
to in this section's heading. The "Ramkavar" propose 
introduction of a state monopoly on trade in bread and gasoline 
as a top-priority anticrisis measure, an extremely prudent step 
most likely under today's conditions. You would have to agree, 
however, that this is quite reminiscent of the "regular goals of 
the Soviet power." While the "Dashnaks" are fighting quite 
energetically from the rostrums of parliament and elsewhere to 
rule out any kind of arbitrary state rule. Although they are 
"comrades." You go sort it out. 
  Nonetheless, in the "still, deep waters" in which the 
Armenian political Mount Olympus presently finds itself, today's 
social atmosphere is fraught with the danger that the prudent 
and kindly Armenian people will suddenly get fed up with 
tolerating the standard-of-living travesty that reigns today, 
and then we may see quite a sudden end to lawful measures and 
slogans. It is extremely difficult to conjecture which political 
doctrine will suddenly capture the multitude.... 
  God forbid we should turn into such a multitude, even for as 
little as a day. If only because the multitude and war are 
already extremely dangerous political neighbors.... 
<H5>  How Do You Live on R800 a Month? </H5>
  An interesting question, of course. But it is in no way 
rhetorical. It is precisely that--800 Russian rubles, converted 
to 176 drams--which today constitutes the minimum wage in 
Armenia. 
  Here it must be taken into account that, in the judgment of 
independent experts, the minimum food-product consumer basket in 
Armenia costs 4,293 drams! In other words, a citizen who has the 
misfortune to be living on the minimum wage receives just 2.5 
percent of the amount he himself needs (not including his 
family!)--and this is only for food. But the average citizen, 
statistically speaking, who receives 350 drams, acquires barely 
5 percent of the minimum basket containing the nourishment 
required by the life form known as Homo sapiens. 
  But in real life everything is not all that horrible--albeit 
quite severe, of course. Many urban residents have started up 
little gardens right in the city or have parcels of land. In the 
Armenian countryside, where people have full ownership of the 
land and have always been famous for efficient management, life 
is self-contained. The city-dweller is also aided by commercial 
structures, where the pay reaches the "unbelievable" amount of 
3,000-4,000 drams (or, converted to Russian currency, on the 
order of R20,000 a month). In this regard, the average price 
index in Yerevan is 1.3-1.5 times greater than corresponding 
prices in Russia. In other words, everything in Armenia (and I 
am referring not to delicacies, but rather to the most basic 
products) costs approximately one-and-a-half times more. 
  But naturally, not many people are receiving a wage of 
3,000-4,000 drams--not the majority, in any case. This is VERY 
high pay according to local standards. Even the president 
receives less--his salary of 12 times the minimum wage comes to 
just over 2,000 drams. 
  Thus, only 5-10 percent of the populace are able to permit 
themselves such basic products as butter, cheese, sausage, and 
eggs. The remainder must content themselves with bread and 
cereal. Then there is a factor of special alarm for the future. 
As a result of the sharp reduction in purchasing power of the 
populace, many entrepreneurs who are bringing commodities into 
the republic are taking losses and being forced to dump their 
products. If a person receives a monthly wage sufficient to buy 
1 kilogram of sugar--please tell me, what kind of consumer can 
he be?! And what kind of purchasing power is there? Especially 
since in Armenia, according to unofficial data, there are over 
80,000 unemployed, of whom only a few thousand are registered 
with the labor exchange with the right to unemployment 
compensation. 
  So if you take into account the fact that winter supplies 
have now run out for many people in Armenia--supplies purchased 
some time ago, at the old, more acceptable prices, more than 50 
percent of the republic's population is threatened with 
starvation. 
  This is how we are living.

<H5>  Lines Getting Longer and Longer at the Russian Embassy </H5>
  "We cannot forget that in obtaining Russian 
citizenship, citizens of Armenia legally become foreigners in 
their own country. We should also not be hasty, if only because 
we have yet to come to terms with property relations in the 
Republic of Armenia," stated Vladimir Starikov, counselor and 
minister of the Russian Federation Embassy in the Republic of 
Armenia, in a conversation with this correspondent. 
  [Vartanyan] Vladimir Stepanovich, there have been persistent 
rumors in Armenia recently to the effect that just about half of 
Armenia has already obtained Russian citizenship or stood in 
line at the embassy for this purpose. Is this true? 
  [Starikov] Rumors to the effect that 300,000-400,000 people 
have already obtained Russian citizenship are untrue. Our 
technical capabilities would not permit it, for one thing (only 
three staff members are working at the consular section of the 
embassy--they simply would not be able to examine and draw up 
such a quantity of documents). From 80 to 100 cases at most can 
be handled per week. As of this moment, just over 2,000 
residents of the Republic of Armenia have obtained Russian 
citizenship. The waiting list is such that processing will not 
be completed until August of 1995. 
  [Vartanyan] How do you view the legal status of these newly 
emerged citizens of Russia--people who have USSR passports at 
present (insofar as the Law on Citizenship has not yet been 
adopted in the Republic of Armenia) and who reside in Armenia? 
  [Starikov] The main problem here lies in the fact that the 
question of dual citizenship has not been resolved. Therefore, 
persons who obtain Russian citizenship and who presently reside 
in Armenia may find themselves in the status of foreigner 
in their own country--unless otherwise stipulated by 
Armenian law. We will explain this in detail to persons who come 
to us for information on the question of obtaining Russian 
citizenship, and we will also explain that Russian citizenship 
provides no advantages to people residing in the Republic of 
Armenia. Quite the contrary: Foreigners everywhere have a status 
somewhat different from citizens. Those who desire to obtain 
Russian citizenship all the same--will obtain it. 
  [Vartanyan] On what legal basis? 
  [Starikov] The registration procedure currently in effect 
for 
obtaining Russian citizenship was introduced by the Russian 
Federation Law on Citizenship, which entered into force 6 
February 1992. This procedure is effective for a three-year 
period. Citizens of Armenia will mainly be interested in point 
"g" of Article 18 of this law. According to this article, 
Russian Federation citizenship is afforded to former Soviet 
citizens, including residents of Armenia, who possess USSR 
passports. 
  [Vartanyan] A fact is a fact--the lines at the Russian 
Embassy in Armenia are becoming longer and more persistent.... 
  [Starikov] We even used the opportunity of a recent 
interview 
in a republic newspaper to appeal to people desiring to acquire 
Russian citizenship, telling them not to resort to illegal 
activities, not to exert pressure on consular section employees 
in an attempt to speed up the application process. 
  [Vartanyan] How do you personally see the striving of a 
large 
number of people to leave Armenia, to sever ties with the 
locations where they have long resided? 
  [Starikov] I believe that everyone should think twice before 
applying at the consular section. We must not be ruled by the 
emotions of the moment. There are problems in Russia too, and 
they will be all the greater for people starting out there with 
nothing. We have to try to resolve our problems here, where we 
live. Russia cannot accept everybody.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant Colonel Pavel Ilin, deputy chief </F>
of a border detachment for personnel, by Vladimir Arutyunyan, 
special correspondent of GOLOS ARMENII for the Shirak region; 
place and date not given: "The Mission of the Border 
Troops--Defense of the Interests of Russia and the Guarding of 
the Exterior Borders of the CIS"] 
  [Text] Since the start of the 19th century 
Gyumri-Aleksandropol had always been regarded as a most 
important strategic point on the southern borders of the Russian 
Empire. And in Soviet times also Leninakan was "singled out" in 
a military respect. The permanent presence of quite a tangible 
contingent of military always creates a distinctive atmosphere 
and makes its mark on the tenor of urban life. Gyumri has always 
treated people in military uniform with affection and respect. 
But even against this background the border guards were a 
special, privileged caste, as it were. As we know, according to 
a number of agreements, the guarding of the "exterior" border of 
Armenia (with Turkey and Iran) has been entrusted to units of 
the border forces of the Russian Federation. On 20 May the 
Gyumri border detachment celebrated its 70th anniversary. On 
this occasion and in connection with the fact that 28 May is 
Border Guards Day we decided to meet with a representative of 
the Gyumri Border Detachment and chat about the present times. 
Our interlocutor is Lieutenant Colonel Pavel Igorevich Ilin, 
deputy chief of the border detachment for personnel and work 
with the staff. 
  [Arutyunyan] A few words about the history of the 
detachment, 
if you will. 
  [Ilin] Our detachment, the oldest on the territory of 
Armenia, was formed in 1924. Two heroes of the Soviet Union: 
Colonel Dudko, who fell in the fighting for Berlin, and Colonel 
Leonov, chief of the detachment, who was posthumously awarded 
the title of hero of the Soviet Union for the events of 15-16 
March 1969 on Damanskiy Island on the Ussuri River, were raised 
here. 
  [Arutyunyan] Previously the border troops were officially 
called the border troops of the USSR KGB. What is the troops' 
present status and what is their place in the overall system of 
the armed forces of Russia? 
  [Ilin] Our relationship with the armed forces is relatively 
undefined. An edict of the president of Russia has formed the 
Federal Border Service, which is subordinate to the president of 
the Russian Federation directly. 
  [Arutyunyan] It is symbolic that your holiday--Border Guards 
Day--coincides in Armenia with our national 
holiday--Independence Day. And independence begins with the 
sanctity of the border. How in this sense do you see the 
functions and missions of the border troops of Russia stationed 
in Armenia? 
  [Ilin] The status and functions of the border troops here 
are 
defined by mutual agreements between the Russian Federation and 
the Republic of Armenia. And the border troops' mission is to 
defend Russia's interests on the territory of the Republic of 
Armenia and to guard the exterior borders of the CIS--in this 
case, the border with Turkey. And, in accordance with the 
agreement, the troops are deployed here to carry out this 
mission. 
  [Arutyunyan] We have already observed that there has always 
been a friendly attitude toward the border guards in our city. 
How are relations shaping up with the authorities and the public 
currently? 
  [Ilin] We are building relations with the authorities at 
practically all levels--from the leadership of the rayons 
through Mr. Kocharyan, authorized government representative for 
the Shirak zone. 
  They consider all our problems their own. And they settle 
practically all the questions that we put to them for support 
for the guarding of the borders. In the past 18 months there 
have been no conflict situations with the local populace or any 
provocations in respect to the border guards. We met just before 
the detachment's anniversary with the leaders of almost all 
enterprises of the city, and they all expressed a single 
thought: The ties of sponsorship that had been established back 
in the so-called stagnation times needed to be restored and more 
meetings with representatives of the enterprises and 
organizations needed to be held. We have already reserved 
sponsorship for some enterprises. 
  [Arutyunyan] The image of the border guard was for many 
years 
here associated with that of the fair-haired Russian type. What 
is the national composition of your detachment, say, now? 
  [Ilin] Representatives of 26-28 nationalities have 
customarily served in our detachment. There are now, in fact, 
just two--Russians and Armenians. More precisely, when draftees 
come from Russia, we come across Bashkirs, say, but mainly 
representatives of the two nationalities (we would add that the 
fact that Armenians also serve in the unit could have been 
guessed without the clarifying question: almost 100 vehicles at 
the gate of the unit and attempts to squeeze through the gate 
and the fence, with a throng at the checkpoint, in a word, the 
painfully familiar native "Armenian landscape"--V.A.). 
  [Arutyunyan] We know from past years that the so-called 
border regime was quite strict. What kind of changes have there 
been in the essence of the border regime? 
  [Ilin] By a decision of the Government of Armenia a number 
of 
forces that used to enter the border zone now no longer do so, 
and the procedure of the drafting of the papers for crossing the 
line of engineer structures has been simplified. We are now 
seeing, however, and the local leadership has appealed to us 
repeatedly in this connection, that it is altogether necessary 
to tighten the regime. This applies particularly to the area of 
the Akhuryanskoye Reservoir and questions of fishing. For the 
inhabitants of some villages have been issued permits for 
agricultural work beyond the line of the engineer structures, 
and they are not cultivating the land but fishing. On the other 
hand, not a tightening up exactly but simply greater strictness 
in the permit procedure is required. Because Turkey remains 
Turkey, and questions of the safety of the inhabitants that work 
in the vicinity of the border cannot be left unattended. 
  [Arutyunyan] Are the violations of the border and 
provocations from "that side" frequent? 
  [Ilin] There are violations both on the part of Turkey and 
from our rear. 
  [Arutyunyan] More detail, if you can: What are the 
violations 
from the rear? 
  [Ilin] These are mainly mentally defective people. If we 
take 
the border itself, however, we have on the part of the 
contiguous territory the rustling of livestock and a violation 
of the border regime almost daily. Rustling of livestock on our 
territory. This also remains at the level of protests as yet--on 
the part of the border commissar. 
  [Arutyunyan] Do such generally quite petty phenomena pursue 
the actual aim of inflaming the atmosphere or are these simply 
chance occurrences? 
  [Ilin] I would not say that the atmosphere on the border is 
being inflamed on Turkey's part today, I could not today say 
this. But there are instances of a violation of the border 
regime that pursue the goal of a test of our strength and of the 
border that we guard. Flights by Turkish combat aircraft along 
the border, say. 
  [Arutyunyan] Living conditions in Armenia are quite 
difficult 
today. What is life like for the detachment under these 
conditions? 
  [Ilin] We are attempting first and foremost to resolve the 
lighting problem. There are border posts that have not had 
lighting for months. In connection with the agreement signed on 
15 March in Yerevan, the Government of Armenia has now allocated 
us cash for the local purchase of flour and to pay for the 
water, lighting, and the products of the meat-packing plant that 
we purchase. But this is not enough for us, all the same. In 
accordance with this agreement, Armenia will assume 50 percent 
of the expenses on the maintenance of the troops, and the amount 
that Armenia should contribute for the upkeep of the troops and 
the border military units on the territory of Armenia has been 
determined. There are problems with firewood and coal. The 
firewood problem is being resolved, it would seem, the coal 
problem, no. We are supplied with gasoline from Russia. There is 
no water at all at our base in the village of Akhurchik, there 
is no water supply. 
  [Arutyunyan] And how has the question of the employment and 
education of the members of the families of the border guards 
been resolved? 
  [Ilin] There is always work for our wives in the detachment, 
this problem has been resolved. Positions to enable women to 
work, on contract included, have been determined at the border 
posts. We have our own kindergarten and our own high school, 
which is attached to School 25 of the city of Sochi. We 
recruited the teachers on a competitive basis--95 percent of 
them are local, and there is a professor and candidate of 
sciences.

<F P=106> [Article by Marina Grigoryan: "To Live for the Sake of </F>
Living or To Live for the Sake of Survival?"] 
  [Text] Does anybody in Armenia think about peace? 
  I admit that this question which has been asked of me (and I 
think not just me) outside the republic puzzles me. Indeed, do 
we think about peace? Or have we fully reconciled ourselves to 
our continued existence under absolutely absurd conditions 
caused by war in the habitual belief that nothing depends on us 
and that the war will be over only when the powers that be wish 
it? In the latter case, which is the closest to the truth we 
must acknowledge that, sad as it might be, Ashot Bleyan alone is 
the one who proposes his concept for achieving peace. We may 
brand him with infamy and call him a traitor all we want, but 
this does not change the crux of the matter: In the greater 
scheme of things, no alternative to Bleyan's approach has been 
proposed. More precisely, the continuation of the war is 
subconsciously expected--a war that has never done anything good 
for any nation. We do have enough common sense or sense of 
dignity to angrily reject Bleyan's ideas, but unfortunately so 
far we have lacked the courage and honesty to ourselves needed 
to publicly acknowledge that he is right on one score: We need 
peace. What price peace--this is another issue, perhaps the 
principal one for us. 
  ...I am fully aware of how slippery and delicate the topic 
is. At present it is not a very accepted practice to talk about 
peace because it is conjectured that it may be achieved in one 
way only: by surrendering Karabakh to Azerbaijan. I will venture 
to state that this is the easiest path toward peace; something 
else is considerably more difficult: to try and break out of the 
captivity of stereotypes which dictate to us this alternative to 
the war only, and to try taking a different view of the 
situation. Bleyan is not at all to blame for proposing this way 
out--no, he has a right to do so, just like any other citizen. 
His fault, and our woe, is that he has discredited and profaned 
the idea of pacifism to such a degree that he has simply turned 
the people off to it. Indeed, such an unacceptable "new path" 
was proposed that it was absolutely clear from the very 
beginning: The people would never go for it. Burying in oblivion 
the historic past, the thing that actually makes Armenians who 
they are, in the name of physical survival--could something more 
shameful have been offered to the people? The calculation was 
accurate: Bleyan became a bugaboo, but at the same time the 
thought became deeply embedded in the minds of the people that 
only Karabakh may be the price of peace, and therefore nothing 
else remains but to continue the war. 
  Our stereotypes have indeed struck powerful and deep roots. 
The conviction that the continuation or discontinuation of the 
war does not depend on us is one of the stereotypes. It is 
difficult to counter this in any way: The interests of strong 
powers indeed intertwine in our region, and as always we are 
mere cogs in this mighty machine. The thought that a small 
nation depends wholly and entirely on the whims of large nations 
and has few ways to possibly influence its own fate has been 
powerfully established in our consciousness for a long time. 
Therefore, we do not have a choice: We must just ask to be taken 
under the wing of the least cruel patron and throw ourselves on 
his mercy. Actually, this is precisely what we have been doing 
over at least the last few centuries. I think I do not have to 
explain what we got as a result: the year 1915 and Aydat. 
  However, if everything is so simple and nothing depends on 
us, why do we reject "Bleyanovism" so angrily? After all, it is 
clear that if it is up to the strong powers to solve the 
problem, for now they are not inclined to agree to the redrawing 
of existing borders. This is point one. Second, such a passive 
position would be more or less acceptable if carnage were not 
going on over there, in Karabakh, in which Armenians, too, are 
cannon fodder. 
  We think that only one conclusion is possible. If we are 
unable to stop the war because someone needs it today, could we 
try pursuing a policy under which peace in our region will be 
more advantageous for this "someone?" So far we have been 
playing the role of mere gladiators, making no attempts to be of 
any interest to others outside of this role--outside of the war. 
This is worth trying because too much is on the line for us. I 
repeat that to this end we should abandon traditional 
approaches, reject the historical inertia of hemming ourselves 
in, and take a fresh view of the situation and our role in it. 
  It is no secret that the array of forces in the region 
hinges 
to a tremendous degree on Russia's presence or absence from it. 
A glance at the historical past easily convinces us that the 
policy of Russia in Transcaucasia and its mechanism have always 
been quite integral, and all manner of deviations in various 
periods of time have been merely different phases of this whole 
policy. The traditional attitude of Armenians toward Russia is 
that toward our savior from the Turks. This is hard to deny; 
however, it is equally hard to unambiguously maintain that the 
very arrival of Russia in the region will by itself bring 
happiness to the Armenian people. 
  This shines through with absolute clarity in the situation 
that has now emerged on account of Karabakh. If we dispense with 
everything extraneous, with the smokescreen of hollow discourse 
and meaningless documents, the main point will take shape: 
Russia is seeking to introduce its armed forces into the region. 
Such is the price for stopping bloodshed to which we agree, at 
least outwardly. We agree in the secret hope that Azerbaijan 
will refuse yet again. We agree, although deep down we 
understand that quite possibly this augurs nothing good for us. 
In other words, we choose the lesser evil. But is it the lesser? 
  I will specify right away that pro-Russian or pro-Western 
orientation is not at issue. At issue is the revision of the 
existing practice of mutual relations with both our neighbors in 
the region and external forces. So far, such practice has boiled 
down to two extremes: either throwing ourselves on the mercy of 
the neighbor in order to physically survive, or striking a deal 
with external forces in order to fight our neighbors with 
assistance from these forces. As history shows, both extremes 
have resulted in disasters. A way out is found in creating a 
harmonious mechanism for mutual relations with all which would 
rule out the necessity of selling out to someone solely in order 
to survive. This is extremely difficult; however, by all signs 
there is no other way. Otherwise, we have to either agree with 
Bleyan or--as is being done at present--go with the flow while 
being clearly aware that this may be very well fraught with a 
recurrence of the tragedy from the beginning of this century. Is 
this cruel? However, history clearly indicates what the tactic 
of political flirtation has done to Armenia. Besides, that same 
history teaches us that it is better to perceive and 
overestimate the danger than underestimate it. We cannot allow 
the mourning procession on 24 April toward the memorial 
commemorating the dead to become the only result of the 1915 
tragedy for us, after all. 
  Naturally, all political concepts presuppose certain givens, 
a foundation from which we need to proceed. To stop being a 
nation which is continuously sacrificed we must be of a certain 
value as far as our activities are concerned for both our 
immediate neighbors and external forces, and make sure that they 
reckon with us instead of accomplishing their tasks with our 
blood. We cannot be the bet of just one force; we must seek many 
bets on us. In this case we would not be needed solely for war. 
In this case we would embark on a path toward peace because we 
would become a component of the policies of several forces at 
once rather than the policy of one force. If we agree to get 
away from the carnage by way of bringing in Russian troops, we 
will cease to be a factor of any consequence in the region 
because this task will already have been solved, and further on 
we will be used to achieve other goals. 
  Therefore, the conclusion is that the further away from us 
Russia is, the more it will support us. The less of Russia there 
is in the region, the more interest Russia will have in Armenia. 
As it withdraws from this region, Russia is compelled to have a 
force here which is an extension of its force. Russia's coming 
would mean that in this sense we would no longer exist for 
Russia. Israel's struggle against American presence in the Near 
East is a classical example. Plainly speaking, when your master 
is not present in your region, you become his representative 
there; when your master appears, you just disappear. The essence 
of the mechanism is simple: to fight the force thanks to which 
you exist. A paradox? This may be so, but what has the orthodox 
way of thinking and actions accomplished for us to date? 
  As I see it, the flexibility and correctness of a policy are 
found in behaving adequately in each specific situation, 
adhering to one tested concept. In our case, each of Russia's 
moves in the region changes the array of forces in it and 
necessitates an adequate response. After all, it may very well 
happen that in one situation one's interests and the interests 
of a traditionally opposed neighbor may coincide. Of course, 
there is nothing new about this: One uses the contradictions of 
other parties to one's own benefit in the event the interests of 
one of these sides coincides with one's own interests. Applying 
this well-known theoretical consideration to the situation 
existing at present, we get the following: Azerbaijan resists 
the introduction of Russian troops to the region; this, shall we 
say, does not hold the promise of special dividends for Armenia, 
either. Why not become an ally of Azerbaijan on this issue? We 
thus become a policy component, and therefore are of interest to 
both sides. Consequently they will not strive to subjugate, use, 
or destroy us. However, this is the case on only one issue; on 
all others we oppose Azerbaijan together with the powerful force 
we represent in the region. 
  This may seem to be merely yet another look at the array of 
forces in the region which does not at all guarantee us peace. 
However, first, nobody is in a position to guarantee peace on an 
issue so complex. Besides, if the statement that war is an 
extension of politics is correct, it is all the more logical to 
consider peace to be an extension of politics. 
  Finally, we can hardly deny the fact that the policy we have 
been pursuing has not resulted in any particular success toward 
a peaceful resolution of the conflict to date. Moreover, against 
the background of interminable negotiations and statements about 
"dedication to a peaceful resolution of the conflict" the flames 
of war are fanned ever stronger, claiming still new lives. 
Indeed, stopping the war does not depend on us alone. However, 
we must be interested in peace more than anyone else; that is, 
we must increase the peaceful component of our card as far as 
possible. 
  EDITORIAL NOTE: Laying no claim at all to covering the 
entire range of issues related to this important problem, to say 
nothing of possessing the ultimate truth, we would like to 
invite for discussion all those who have something to say on 
this point. Anyone who cares about the fate of the Motherland 
and its people cannot help pondering what we are going to 
bequeath to our children on this land--the eternal necessity of 
purely physical survival or an opportunity to live lives worthy 
of people and build a new Armenia?

<F P=106> [Interview with Aram Sarkisyan, chairman of the Democratic </F>
Party of Armenia, by Shamiram Agabekyan; place and date not 
given: "'Armenia Needs Not a Leader With a Team but a Team With 
a Leader'"] 
  [Text] Elections to the republic's parliament are 
impending. Whatever the predictions of Vano Syradegyan on 
Armenian Television concerning the possible outcome of the 
elections, the opposition intends having its say. Shamiram 
Agabekyan's interview with Aram Sarkisyan, chairman of the 
Democratic Party of Armenia, will help readers of GOLOS 
determine what specifically this party brings to the elections 
and the position that it holds. 
  [Agabekyan] Mr. Sarkisyan, it may be said that GOLOS has 
just 
once comprehensively addressed the activity of the Democratic 
Party. This was two years ago. Much water has since then 
flown.... 
  [Sarkisyan] Yes, and it is to be regretted merely that four 
years ago, when the party was founded, it came to be called 
democratic, being essentially a social democratic program also. 
We were reluctant to "steal a march" on the people of 
Gnchak--the traditional national party. The gesture of propriety 
was, I believe, inappropriate. Aside from all else, time has 
shown that this party is far removed from social democratic 
ideas. I can only go by the newspaper GNCHAK AYASTAINI, for that 
matter, for there is simply no other evidence of this party's 
presence and political behavior in the republic. 
  The political platform of the Democratic Party is freedom of 
the individual, justice, and solidarity. The aim is defense of 
the interests of the man working for wages, that is, the working 
person. So this is the quintessential popular party, a party of 
social justice. 
  [Agabekyan] Should it be assumed that the "economic slogan" 
of your party rules out private ownership and market relations? 
  [Sarkisyan] On the contrary. We support the development of 
market relations. But without a flouting of the principles of 
social justice, without the abrupt polarization of society into 
poor and rich. A vulgar market is unacceptable not only because 
a polarized society is the most dangerous society. We need to 
take account of the fact that for 70 years the people of Armenia 
lived according to different political, economic, and social 
criteria and that they totally reject the transformation 
proposed by the present administration. 
  Our formula is the market to the extent that it is possible 
and government regulation to the extent that it is necessary 
(Willy Brandt). In order that the first part of the formula 
operate efficiently it is essential to put both parts on an 
equal footing in functional significance. Priorities should be 
conditioned merely by economic necessity. We would recall that 
when she assumed office, Margaret Thatcher nationalized some 
companies, compensating them for loss, of course. Then, having 
increased the profitability of the works and sectors even by 
government measures, she denationalized them. 
  We also reject identification with foreign models, 
proceeding 
from the fact that Armenia's economy, like the evolved national 
mentality, bears the imprint of 70 years of the building of 
socialism. The model that we have devised fits into the general 
social democratic concept of democratic socialism, but is based 
on the realities that have taken shape in Armenia. 
  [Agabekyan] The political behavior of the Democratic Party 
today is more "oppositional" than that of other parties of a 
socialist persuasion. Why is this? 
  [Sarkisyan] One reason, perhaps--rejection of the style and 
methods of government of the present administration. The path 
that it is proposing and pursuing has brought our people 
suffering and irreparable losses both economically and socially. 
The authorities maintain that they are being true to the 
principles of democracy: freedom of speech, some other things 
besides. In actual fact, the very concept of power, the civil 
society, and so forth have been discredited. 
  But the problem is that there is with us a certain internal 
dissension. On the one hand our program principle dictates 
Armenia's conversion into a democratic state with stable, 
developed democratic institutions, which in itself precludes a 
revolutionary, forcible change of power. On the other, seeing 
the situation in which the people and the state as a whole have 
found themselves, we understand that each day that the present 
administration continues in office brings the republic closer to 
catastrophe. 
  It is this dissension that forces us to seek radical changes 
democratically. The Democratic Party proposed the creation of a 
national-state council, the formation of a government of 
national accord.... And recently, availing ourselves of the 
right of legislative initiative, we proposed that parliament 
discuss the question of the government's resignation. 
  [Agabekyan] And are the authorities paying any attention to 
your proposals? 
  [Sarkisyan] In February of last year we met with the 
president, for it had been contemplated that the state council 
would be headed by the president himself, but without the right 
of veto. 
  Ignoring all that had been proposed, the president responded 
merely to this fact: He would not be such a president, he said. 
On the other hand, he reprimanded us for bias--we were 
unobjective in our analysis of the situation that had taken 
shape in the republic, had not mentioned the good works of the 
president himself.... 
  Levon Ter-Petrosyan expressed his position, for that matter, 
in a memorable speech at a sitting of the Supreme Soviet. The 
idea of national accord was for him a fraudulent category. Was 
this not an attempt to "justify" by hook or by crook his 
reluctance to be a president of all the people, not its AOD 
[Armenian National Movement] part? And since the AOD retains the 
least significant part of society, he is president of this small 
stratum. 
  [Agabekyan] Your party no longer, we are to infer, cleaves 
to 
the idea of a state council. What are its tasks today? 
  [Sarkisyan] Yes and no. It is essential now to seek the 
adoption of a constitution (the draft of the six parties) and 
new elections. If the constitutional process reaches impasse, it 
is essential to seek early parliamentary elections. 
  With the people's support for our demands for early 
elections, a new political situation, with which both the 
authorities and the opposition would be forced to reckon, would 
be created. 
  [Agabekyan] But will you have this support? It is no secret 
that a large part of the populace is skeptical toward both the 
authorities and the opposition, considering the first greedy and 
aggressive, and the second, amorphous and inactive. 
  [Sarkisyan] The head-butting of antagonistic political 
forces 
is unacceptable to us. There would be no way of crawling out of 
such a situation--the republic would be doomed. 
  I would advise some ardent champions of militant 
confrontation inciting from their own quiet corner the 
opposition to drive the people to the barricades to try this 
themselves. It would then be quickly seen that the people do not 
support these methods. 
  Account must be taken also of the situation in the region. 
Serious policy rejects a disregard for national interests. But 
the key to a solution of the Karabakh conflict is in the hands 
of a third force also. 
  The opposition itself has a problem. The problem of 
consolidation. In a normal society parties with different 
ideologies are at different sides of the political arena. But we 
have achieved cooperation on specific issues of constitutional 
arrangement. 
  The Democratic Party has considered and now considers a 
principal area of work the unification of constructive political 
forces for the solution of specific questions of constitutional 
arrangement. Take if only the constitutional council for civil 
accord. What is this if not an example proving to the president 
that consolidation in the name of the national interest is not 
only possible but also essential? 
  [Agabekyan] Is it possible to speak of the mass character of 
the Democratic Party? 
  [Sarkisyan] Were there a party of 50,000 persons in Armenia, 
I assure you that this party would have been in power long ago. 
There are no mass parties in our republic nor, perhaps, will 
there be until the legal status of the state has been 
determined, a true multiparty system has become firmly 
established, and on this basis a president of the republic has 
been elected. 
  We understand those who are demanding more assertiveness of 
the opposition. People are bitter, and not everyone cares to 
accept the motives for the "quiet behavior" of political forces, 
believing that such rules of the game are appropriate in a 
democratic society, but not here. They are largely right. When a 
person who is accustomed to average sufficiency is forced to 
sell his chattels that it has taken him years to acquire, you do 
not have to be a rocket scientist to understand that the people 
have been reduced to poverty and that the state has ceased to 
perform its elementary functions. 
  We have become a self-governed society subjected, in 
addition, to unique repressive measures in the form of the 
absence of minimal protection and of corruption, impunity, 
bribery, and a whole bouquet of other vices forcing Armenians to 
leave their homeland. 
  The mass outflow is a consequence of the policy of the 
present regime. At the same time, on the other hand, availing 
itself of the current legal turmoil, 10-15 percent of society is 
making colossal fortunes, which also are being exported from the 
republic, incidentally. 
  But we would emphasize the following reality as well. While 
subjected to the above repressive measures, the people are 
strangely yielding to implanted cliches of the type: Who if not 
Levon, or what would change with the advent of new people, or 
everywhere else is just as bad as here! And the blockade, the 
energy crisis, and so forth that set the teeth on edge. 
  But is the problem of the leader urgent? In proposing a 
parliamentary form of rule our party is sure that in the present 
transitional period it is essential to have an authority that is 
subject to control. Armenia needs today not a leader with a team 
but a team with a leader. 
  The advent of new forces is a natural process. And to impede 
this is to make the situation in the republic worse, especially 
since the present administration has exhausted itself in all 
parameters. 
  As far as the "everywhere is just as bad" cliche is 
concerned.... I can bear witness to the fact that the situation 
in republics similar to Armenia is many times better, for the 
state structures are performing their functions. 
  And the blockade.... This is a good screen for covering 
one's 
own inability to govern. It is a screen, rather, that is needed 
for the burgeoning of mafia structures. If a private trader can 
under the same conditions bring into the republic X quantity of 
a commodity, why is the government--the principal 
banker--incapable of competing with him? 
  Yes, the present administration is fully played out. It is 
no 
accident that we are witnessing periodic showdowns between 
former associates. In a normal state, given such exposures, the 
president does not remain in the role of detached observer of 
the scandals shaking his noble family. For let us consider. Even 
the initiative for the creation of an interim parliamentary 
commission does not belong to him, the president. Comment here 
is superfluous. 
  [Agabekyan] What do you propose? 
  [Sarkisyan] There is one way out of the present situation. 
Specifically, our party is embarking on an election campaign and 
is calling on all political organizations to begin without delay 
to present their political program to the people. It is 
essential to once again revive the people's faith in honest, 
competent politicians and honest, competent policy.

<F P=106> [Article by Narek Mesropyan: "An Ambassadors' Plot? They </F>
Would Have Behaved Better in `High Society'"] 
  [Text] People behave differently as guests, but even when 
they feel themselves "at home," it is only to up a certain 
limit. There are lines that are not to be crossed. These 
unwritten laws exist not only among Armenians. And we are not 
the ones who invented the saying "my home is my castle." And a 
castle has its own rules. In short, one does not bring his own 
samovar to Tula; when in Rome, do as the Romans do; and so on. 
There are no rules without exceptions, however. 
  It is assumed that if you feed someone, this gives you 
certain rights. For fairness' sake, we should point out that 
this exception has become a rule not only here, but in every 
corner of one-sixth of the dry land. Here, however, unlike in 
other places, guests feel free to do things they perhaps would 
not dare to do even among Australian aborigines. 
  I am talking about the most honored guests. Ambassadors. 
  What Mr. Stupishin, the Russian Federation ambassador, felt 
free to do is well known. It only seems at the first glance that 
his attacks were aimed at our newspaper: It is obvious to 
everyone whose pain and concerns GOLOS ARMENII voices. In any 
event, those whose interests are described on our pages do not 
throw a feast amidst a plague, do not take advantage of the 
people's misery, do not buy up for peanuts art works or, for 
instance, silver, and do not pretend that the obvious wealth of 
some is the expression of well-being of all others. These people 
have no relation to the ruling circles, which does not mean at 
all that they do not have a right to life and their own 
viewpoint. 
  In attempting to morally destroy them in one strike (and 
using the basest verbal cliches at that), the ambassador of 
Russia (we hope, though, an ambassador of only certain circles 
of it) already now, long before the beginning of the election 
campaign, attempted to wipe out a whole class of people who 
resist the current authority--which means lawlessness, an 
authoritarian regime, attempts at completely turning the country 
into a police state, and many other troubles, which constitutes 
everything we habitually still call life. 
  Let us not talk about diplomatic etiquette and its 
expression 
in every particular case. When there is a street fight, good 
manners are dispensed with. And Mr. Stupishin needed so much to 
do publicly a service for the current Armenian authorities, 
which almost entirely absorbed the main inciters of anti-Russian 
sentiments, that he did get into this street fight, not noticing 
in the heat of servitude that he is turning into a color he 
likes to paint others with. 
  But is he alone? 
  Not too much time has passed since the kerosene benefactor, 
U.S. Ambassador Mr. Gilmore, decided to complement humanitarian 
aid with public statements that Armenia has the right 
authorities. We had barely had time to digest Bush's praise of 
Levon Ter-Petrosyan when the ambassador began to opine that 
those who, figuratively speaking, see even one spot on the 
bright sun of the AOD [Armenian National Movement], are wrong. 
The pro-Petrosyan lobby made of ambassadors thus became as 
run-of-the-mill a thing as, for instance, "all-people's support" 
for Yeltsin's resolve that manifested itself in the tanks 
shelling the Russian Supreme Soviet. 
  The new world order, whose establishment is propped on the 
shoulders of both Yeltsin and Ter-Petrosyan, apparently also 
assumes a new function for diplomacy. Ambassadors are permitted, 
for instance, to interfere unceremoniously in the internal 
affairs of the countries where they are accredited, express 
their opinion on the subject of some or other political force or 
simply a group of people, exert pressure on the public 
opinion--which means on the formation of a political system. A 
convenient and useful one for them in every respect, of course. 
  Any state that is bold enough to call itself sovereign, even 
for appearances' sake, should theoretically be upset over the 
diplomatic "liberties" and attempt to make it clear to the 
frolicking ambassadors that this sort of attitude at the very 
least is demeaning; such a natural protest, however, apparently 
has been dropped from the rules of behavior both by superpowers 
and by those who, having lost their tracks, cannot decide which 
republic--in a numeric count--of his country he is the head of. 
  And since such simple things are still a subject for debate, 
there is nothing shameful in feeling free to drop a delicate 
hint or resort to very obvious dictat. Just recently, for 
instance, the French ambassador, Mme. d'Arteng, reproached 
Armenia that our republic had not been brave enough to start 
searching for new allies. But if one can somehow swallow such 
remarks, seeing them as a statement of a fait accompli and the 
diplomatic defeat of the ambassador herself, it is not clear why 
did Mme. d'Arteng would need to send our young men, who have 
already been in the war, to foreign countries, thereby 
condemning them to the status of "wild geese." Is it perhaps 
that the ambassador wants to protect the current regime from 
those who already are used to fighting evil by other methods 
and, given the current omnipotence of the police, will not feel 
comfortable? 
  One can ask himself a lot of such questions. No answers will 
be forthcoming anyway. Everybody will do what they see fit to 
do. Without restraint. 
  Actually, when one is surrounded by lawlessness, it is hard 
to expect that even ambassadors will behave themselves as they 
would in high society. And because of that, in all truth, their 
plot exudes too much of the local aroma.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Peasants Will Be Satisfied. </F>
Grain Procurement Prices Raised"] 
  [Text] In order to increase the material incentive for 
producers to increase volumes of grain sales to the state and in 
order to save on the expenditure of hard currency funds on the 
acquisition of grain from abroad, and also taking into account 
the higher costs of material and technical resources and energy 
sources used on the farms, the growth of inflation, and the 
higher prices on the world market, the Azerbaijan Cabinet of 
Ministers considered it expedient to adopt the proposals of the 
Ministry of Agriculture, the State Grain Products Company, and 
the Ministry of Economics to raise prices of grain from internal 
reserves. 
  As an AZERTADZH correspondent was told in the Ministry of 
Agriculture, the average selling price of one tonne of grain 
from the 1994 crop sold to the state is 50,000 manats, a 
sevenfold increase over last year's prices. Taking into account 
the fact that priority in raising procurement prices has been 
given to hard and strong strains of wheat, the following prices 
have been set: for one tonne of hard wheat meeting requirements 
of class I--65,000 manats, of class II--62,000 manats, and of 
class III--55,000 manats; for strong and soft strains, 
regardless of class--48,000-53,000 manats; for one tonne of 
barley--46,000 manats, of corn--50,000 manats, and of peas for 
human consumption--94,000 manats. 
  The ministry has prepared additional recommendations in 
order 
to increase the material incentive for machine operators and 
other workers to harvest the grain at optimal times and without 
losses. It is stipulated that each combine operator 
participating in the harvest may be issued as wages 50 manats 
and 10 kilograms of grain, and their assistants, 35 manats and 7 
kilograms of grain for each tonne harvested; truck drivers are 
to be issued, in addition to their wages, one kilogram of grain 
for each tonne that is transported. Additionally, combine 
operators are to be paid bonuses in the amount of 1,500-2,500 
manats, depending on the volume of grain reaped during the 
season. 
  Ministry of Agriculture workers think that raising grain 
procurement prices will have a positive effect on strengthening 
the economies of the farms, will increase the material incentive 
for workers, and will make it possible to achieve an increase in 
the volumes of grain sold to the state.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Protsenko: "Russians in Estonia"] </F>
  [Text] In these notes I am simply relating what I was told 
in numerous conversations in Tallinn by so-called 
"representatives of the Russian-speaking population" of Estonia. 
I will not give the names of the people I spoke with, because I 
do not want to create additional problems for people who are 
already sufficiently well-known. I will stress, however, that 
these people were not "extremists," but completely loyal 
residents of the republic: Most of them are citizens of Estonia 
(and consequently are not experiencing these difficulties 
personally) and some even acquired this status through a special 
procedure for the extraordinary services they performed for the 
young state. 
<H5>  "They Cheated Us Again!" </H5>
  Minister of Nationality and Population Issues Peeter Olesk 
recently commented on the resurgence of tension in Estonia. He 
was right: There could be an explosion, because they cheated us 
again. During the arguments over citizenship, we told the 
"internationalists" not to be ridiculous: The "zero option" was 
unacceptable to the Estonians and incomprehensible to the West. 
In the final analysis, Estonia was regaining its statehood with 
an alarmingly skewed demographic tendency: Before the war 8 
percent of the population was Russian, but now Russians 
represent 38 percent of the total. All we wanted was for each 
inhabitant who had a permanent residence permit prior to July 
1990 to be granted the status of a permanent resident. This 
status would secure virtually all of the necessary rights and 
all forms of social protection. 
  Here is what we achieved: The law on foreigners stated that 
everyone would receive a residence permit, but one word was left 
out of the text--permanent. The result was a 
procedure by which each non-citizen would first receive a 
temporary residence permit and the right to apply for permanent 
resident status in three years. At that time officials could 
either approve or deny the request. What is even worse is that 
according to the published regulations, the present temporary 
document will expire on 12 July 1995. At that time non-citizens 
will have to apply for a new temporary permit, and whereas 
Estonia promised to issue the present document to everyone, it 
can be selective in issuing the next. If they catch a "temporary 
resident" in an intoxicated state, they will have grounds for 
denying his application. For that matter, the government could 
decide that the country does not need that many temporary 
residents.... 
<H5>  Return My Property </H5>
  More than 600,000 of the 1.5 million people in the republic 
are Russian-speakers. The Estonians believe that this poses a 
threat to the very existence of their nationality: It could be 
diluted to the point of its complete disappearance. They say 
that the proportional number of Russians should be reduced to a 
more acceptable 25 percent of the population. They encourage 
"Estonization"--requiring the non-Estonian spouse in a mixed 
marriage to take the Estonian surname. This was already the case 
in the years between 1932 and 1938, when a person had to have an 
Estonian name to get a job. Many of today's prominent Estonians 
are the descendants of people who changed their names (for 
example, Foreign Minister Juri Luik). For this reason, the 
suggestion that the Russians represented only 8 percent of the 
population before the war is a myth. 
  [Boxed item: "The goal of Russian policy is not armed 
intervention. The Russians have economic ambitions. They want to 
buy economic property of strategic significance through 
figureheads and then demand maximum rights for all of the people 
living here" (Tiit Viahi, chairman of Tallinn Municipal 
Assembly, DEN ZA DNEM, 28 April 1994).] 
  The official slogan of the campaign--the suggestion that the 
Soviet Union pursued a policy of Russification in Estonia--is 
also a myth. The Soviet Union had no demographic policies at 
all, including a Russification policy. It pursued a policy of 
assistance in the economic development of outlying regions. The 
Estonians, who are conformists and are loyal to the existing 
government, joined the "socialist competition" for the highest 
indicators of regional industrial development. Estonfosforit was 
turned into an industrial giant at the request of the Estonian 
Government, and so was Dvigatel, the New Tallinn Port, and 
Estonslanets--all in response to local initiatives. The 
industrial giants needed manpower, and the Estonians themselves 
did not want to work in industry, transportation, or 
construction. 
  According to one theory (not all of the people I spoke with 
agreed), the movement to "get rid of the Russians" had no 
political aims in the beginning. It was simply that the 
Estonians were frightened by the growth of the Russian-speaking 
intelligentsia, which had begun to strive for secondary, if not 
primary, positions in public administration, science, and 
culture. 
  There is a suspicion that the present move to turn all 
non-citizens into temporary residents of the republic is based 
on purely materialistic motives. During the three years it will 
take the Russians to acquire the status of permanent residents, 
all property in Estonia will be privatized, and the republic 
"pie" will be divided up among a million residents instead of a 
million and a half. The establishment of a non-state economy 
will be completed during those years. Today the "Russian 
Estonians" are stronger than the ethnic Estonians in the 
economic sphere, but the opposite will be true in three years. 
<H5>  Miscalculations </H5>
  Estonia began pursuing its stringent economic policy with 
this slogan: We will suffer for a while and we will endure, but 
"they" will not be able to take it and they will leave. Special 
sociological surveys confirmed that eight out of ten Estonians 
were still in contact with relatives in the countryside, which 
would help them survive the hard times. Only one out of every 
four Russians had connections of this kind. No one, however, 
expected the state of the Russian economy to undergo such rapid 
deterioration. 
  Only 80,000 people left in two years. According to 
projections, the same number of "Russian-speaking residents" 
will leave the republic in the future. The rest have nowhere to 
go. The main problem is housing, and buying a home will be 
almost impossible even for those who manage to sell a home in 
Estonia: Apartment prices in Tallinn, for example, are only 
one-fourth as high as they are in Moscow. 
  [Boxed item: "The issue of ethnic minorities is still 
unclear 
to many people. Only a handful of people in Estonia can 
categorize themselves as members of ethnic minorities. The rest, 
according to international law, are immigrants. If we continue 
to stress this fact, Russia will have no more arguments in 
defense of its minority...." (Mart Rannut, director of Language 
Department, DEN ZA DNEM, 28 April 1994).] 
  These prices are likely to drop again in the near future. 
The 
last military troops are expected to leave soon (making 1,500 
dwellings available), and there is a plan to force the veterans 
out--leaving another 10,000-12,000 apartments vacant. This will 
not change the demographic situation in the republic, but as a 
result of its efforts to get rid of the "dead weight," Estonia 
is now losing the most highly skilled segments of its labor 
force: The people who are leaving are those who can expect to 
find good jobs elsewhere. The youngest and most confident 
individuals are moving to the West, and the others are heading 
east. The people who are staying are those who are not needed 
anywhere else. 
  Meanwhile, the rate of unemployment in the republic is 
rising, primarily in "Russian" production areas. As a result of 
this, the crime rate is also rising. The northeast has become a 
high-crime zone. Police records indicate that thefts are not 
confined to valuables. Thieves are stealing food out of 
refrigerators and cellars. The transfer of non-citizens to the 
category of temporary residents could make them ineligible for 
unemployment benefits, and this could lead directly to a life of 
crime. 
  The lumpenization of the Russian-speaking population is 
being 
fostered by the quick transition to the "official state 
language": The number of Russian schools and classes is 
decreasing, and instruction is being offered only in the 
Estonian language in tekhnikums and in vocational and technical 
institutes as well as in higher academic institutions. 
Difficulties in obtaining an education or training in a special 
field are helping to turn Russian-speaking youths into criminals. 
<H5>  Russian Policy: Just Imagine!... </H5>
  At the end of last year Pavel Grachev suddenly announced 
that 
he was stopping the withdrawal of troops from Estonia. Everyone 
here, however, saw the continued departure of one echelon after 
another. Recently there was another such statement: The troops 
will not be withdrawn! But there are no more troops in Estonia. 
Estonian radicals are quite pleased with these announcements: We 
have an enemy in the East! The National Independence Party holds 
demonstrations--with picketers holding up signs saying "Russians 
Go Home!"--each Monday in front of the headquarters of the naval 
base, where the remaining staff consists of only around 15 
officers. The admiral sitting in the headquarters building gets 
extremely irritated. 
  This is certain to affect the Russian community in the 
republic. The next parliamentary elections will be held in a 
year, but the campaign has already begun. Many parties and 
politicians are building their campaigns around the "enemy 
image" of Russia. The logical extension of this is the 
suggestion that the Russians in Estonia are the enemy within. 
They are even using a new term to refer to the Russians: the 
civilian occupation. 
  There are many things Russia could have done. If it had just 
pursued a more or less consistent policy toward the Baltic 
countries, or if Russia had used its authority to influence the 
European countries when Estonia wanted to join the Council of 
Europe, so that this membership could have been conditional upon 
several factors--this would have been fully in accordance with 
international standards. Instead, just two days before the 
ceremonial act, after everything had already been decided, 
Andrey Kozyrev made a fiery speech. He had his say, Estonia was 
accepted as a member anyway, and the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs fell silent again. 
  There is so much that Russia could do without interfering in 
the internal affairs of other states: It could offer legal 
assistance or legal reviews of the legislative instruments and 
administrative ordinances pertaining to the Russian-speaking 
population. After all, the Russians here have a problem: There 
are no experts in international law! They can sense that an 
inhumane legal instrument has been passed in violation of 
international law. They can say that it is a violation, but they 
cannot say exactly why it is a violation. When the delegation 
from Russia at the talks with Estonia was headed by Sergey 
Shakhray, he would state his objections in the most precise 
terms, saying that something was in violation of a specific 
article of a specific document, and no one could argue, because 
he was an expert! 
<H5>  Economics and Politics </H5>
  Russia took the wrong approach to the Baltic problems from 
the very beginning. One of Boris Yeltsin's advisers came to 
Tallinn, brushed our questions aside, and made this promise: 
Everyone owes us money, he said, and Estonia owes us 7 billion 
rubles. It will give us the union enterprises in payment of the 
debt, and everything will be as it was before! This aroused a 
wave of protests in the republic: Even if the government had 
wanted to make concessions to Russia, it could not do this any 
longer. Estonia had to apply to the West for credit, but it did 
pay its debt to Russia. 
  After this, Russia even had difficulty buying a mineral 
fertilizer plant in Estonia--even on the most beneficial terms 
for Estonia. There was a time when Russia could have taken the 
metallurgical combine in Sillamae "under its wing"--becoming a 
shareholder on the strength of its raw materials (the combine 
had always worked with raw material from Kazakhstan and the 
Urals). This is a city with 20,000 inhabitants, and almost half 
of them were employed by the combine. If Russia had done this, 
they would not be living in a state of almost total unemployment 
today and they would have kept the Russian schools and cultural 
centers open. Instead of living like parasites, they could be 
respectable individuals and taxpayers and would be defending 
Russia's strategic interests here. 
  Instead of this, Russia decided to support the Estonian 
middlemen who were sending Russian nonferrous metals to the 
West: If an Estonian and an Estonian Russian applied to a 
Russian official for an export license, the Estonian was more 
likely to receive preferential treatment. 
  [Boxed item: "I think Mr. Peeter Olesk--minister of 
`nationality and expulsion issues'--and Mrs. Marju 
Lauristin--minister of social `ills'--should ask the government 
to consider establishing a special ward in some hospital for 
people who have been driven to distraction by the government and 
the inhumane laws, so that they could come to terms with life 
with a physician's help. Civilized countries have hospitals of 
this kind for cancer patients, but we should have them for 
people in a completely hopeless situation" (from a letter by 
Z.S. to MOLODEZH ESTONII, 28 April 1994).] 
  Today the "troubled waters" that once offered such lucrative 
fishing opportunities no longer exist. This means that the 
Russian immigrants in Estonia have an even more critical need 
for Russia to pursue a reasonable protectionist policy. Transit 
shipments through Estonia, for example, should be handled by 
Russian firms, which would be willing to do excellent work even 
with a lower profit margin as long as they could have long-term 
contracts. These firms would spend part of the profit on social 
programs to aid the Russian-speaking population. The Business 
League in Estonia and the Estonian-Russian Business Chamber 
could aid in finding these partners and in monitoring the 
fulfillment of obligations. 
  In fact, a relationship of this kind is already being 
established with Moscow because of the policies of the pragmatic 
Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov. This could serve as a model of relations 
with other countries that were once republics of the USSR. After 
all, there are Russians (or "Russian-speakers") everywhere 
today, and the attitude toward the ethnic Russians would change 
if people could see how diligently Russia can support its 
"fellow-countrymen"....

<F P=106> [Interview with Aivars Millers, President of the Limited </F>
Liability Company Industrial Development Agency, by Vilis 
Selecks: "Industry: Yesterday, Today. And Tomorrow? A. Millers: 
I Think This Administration Is Leftist"] 
  [Text] 
  [Selecks] Let us begin, Mr. Millers, with a brief look at 
the 
past. Following the events of August, 1991, you became Minister 
of Industry and Energy. How do you now rate your job as Minister? 
  [Millers] That was a time when, like so many others, I 
performed my job with a great deal of enthusiasm, not thinking 
about resources, the family, and not considering what would 
happen when I no longer had authority and was no longer needed 
by anyone. Of course, I do not regret the two years I spent as 
Minister, because they opened up other horizons. I gained a much 
wider circle of acquaintances. This keeps me alive and working 
at present. I don't want to bring up my personal accomplishments 
in the Ministry. We were working as a collective, and if 
something valuable was accomplished, then it was by joint 
effort. Our capabilities were predetermined by the conditions or 
rules of the game. 
  First of all, I should mention the existing, or more often 
non-existing legislation, which was dependent on the Supreme 
Council's activities. Second, there was the matter of the 
resources allotted to us to carry out the resolutions and 
directives of the Supreme Council. I was uncomfortable with 
these game rules. But we were unable to change them. 
  What were we being asked to do most often? Create favorable 
conditions for business activities. That was our Ministry's main 
objective. What to produce, in what volume, and how to 
accomplish this -- these were not our concerns. 
  [Selecks] What do you feel are your main accomplishments? 
What was done correctly? 
  [Millers] I think this was to replace the management staff 
in 
the industrial concerns. As you know, many plant managers were 
against Latvian independence. I had no objections to them as 
people, but they could not remain as managers of state property, 
if at one time they had been opposed to this state. 
  It should be noted that the public's negative opinions about 
industry were, to a great extent, related to the activities of 
these plant managers. 
  This was a very difficult and unrewarding job, because it 
was 
necessary to go and say -- we no longer need your services. This 
had to be told to managers who had worked in their positions for 
many years. We made a effort to follow the rule -- while 
changing the management, the plant's activities must not be 
allowed to deteriorate. Overall, about 70 percent of the largest 
concerns received new directors. At that time, there were many 
political leaders -- quite a bit more than necessary. But there 
was a lack of management specialists. Therefore, it was 
difficult to find new plant directors. I would have been unable 
to accomplish this if the Ministry had not operated as a unified 
team. At present, we can see that the change in management has 
been unsuccessful in only three or four cases. 
  [Selecks] At present, we are hearing claims that the 
Ministry 
of Industry has destroyed industry... 
  [Millers] The decline of industry was apparently an 
independent process. We were unable to slow it down, although we 
tried. Of course, to a large extent, it was influenced by the 
Supreme Council. The Ministry proposed various reforms, but was 
unable to realize them because the Supreme Council rejected 
them. For example, we wanted to replace Moscow's centralized 
board with a collective industrial board, and studied foreign 
experience with such a measure. But the Supreme Council, by 
adopting the law on the state enterprise board rejected our 
proposal. Supposedly, bureaucrats would interfere with the 
director performing his job. In this matter, the viewpoints of 
Mr. Kehris and those of the pro-interfront plant directors 
coincided. We were unsuccessful in fending them off. This is 
because the viewpoints of the deputies were such as they were in 
the particular situation. Changing them was impossible. The 
concept could not be realized because it was not accepted by the 
public nor supported by the deputies in parliament. All the 
same, such a concept did not become realized. 
  [Selecks] But the sudden decline in industry was not only 
induced by the mistakes of the Supreme Council. 
  [Millers] Once again, I stress that it was an independent 
process, influenced by various factors. After the political 
changes in Latvia, we were left without work, and our products 
had no buying market. Engineers and managers were not prepared 
to reorient themselves quickly. It was necessary to develop 
contacts with the West, but our enterprises did not know how to 
purchase assembly components, nor how to sell completed 
products. For example, for many years, "Radiotehnika" produced 
one grade of equipment for the Soviet Union. From the latter, we 
received many components, which we assembled and sent back as a 
completed product. Naturally, the entire production line fell 
apart when this contact was lost. That was an unavoidable 
process. If we want to save and develop radioelectronics in 
Latvia, which, in my opinion, has potential, then we have to 
reorient ourselves on the West -- buy components from them, 
produce high-quality goods, which would be on the same level, 
qualitatively, as the imports, which have flooded all of our 
stores. There is one more request -- for the state to protect 
enterprises that are producing goods for internal consumption. 
  [Selecks] In what manner? 
  [Millers] The same manner as in other countries. In this 
respect, there are many measures available. Including taxes and 
customs. The main thing is for people to have jobs. If there is 
work, a person can get by, and he also pays taxes. Thus, there 
are resources for social assistance, education. We will not 
become rich only by selling. For this reason, every country 
protects its market, thus protecting the jobs of its people. 
  [Selecks] Supposedly, Latvia's industry has very little 
potential, and therefore, we must refocus on trade, financing. 
What do you say about this? 
  [Millers] I do not agree. The state cannot exist without 
manufacturing. In all developed countries, about 25 to 30 
percent of the workforce is involved in manufacturing. That is 
the main source of financial income. It should be the same in 
Latvia. Also, agriculture is necessary. If only to promote a 
uniform distribution of residents throughout the country. It 
will be necessary to subsidize agriculture, and the resources 
for these subsidies can only come from manufacturing. Therefore, 
we must consider its development. 
  [Selecks] But the Swiss are given as an example of major 
banking potential. 
  [Millers] We should obtain more objective and correct 
information about Switzerland. Even there, 30 percent of the 
workforce is employed in industry. This is a paradox for a 
nation, which everyone only considers to be a banking and 
financial paradise. Yet, even this small country cannot get 
along without industry. 
  [Selecks] Thus, you feel that Latvia's industry could 
develop, if the state creates a system for protecting the local 
market. 
  [Millers] That is the first requirement. But it is not the 
only one. Another important condition is a good taxation 
policy. Right now, Latvia is moving in a ridiculous 
direction. The theory predominates that -- the greater the 
taxes, the larger the budget. I cannot agree with this. I wonder 
why such thinking is predominant in economics. Unfortunately, it 
was strong even under the Godmanis administration. Budgetary 
problems are constantly being solved by measures to increase 
taxes. There are a sufficient number of examples in the world, 
which show the absurdity of this psychology. Even in such a 
small country as Cypress. What is the sales tax there? Only 8 
percent. In addition, there is a great deal of easement for 
those enterprises that wish to start up activities, invest 
capital, create new jobs. The so-called tax-exempt 
days are extended even to 10 to 20 years, relative to the 
invested capital and number of jobs created. 
  When starting a business in Latvia, all investments must be 
made from the profits remaining after you have paid off earnings 
and other taxes. Sales tax -- 18 percent, earnings tax -- 25 
percent (incidentally, this is one of the highest tax rates in 
all Europe), social taxes -- 37 percent, etc. Under such 
conditions, no foreigner will start a business in Latvia. The 
gains he receives from cheap labor do not balance out the losses 
created by high taxes. Thus, there is no basis for the hope of 
foreign investments. In addition, the taxation policy is 
constantly changing, which creates supplemental difficulties. 
  [Selecks] How do you feel about the optimistic prediction 
that a growth in manufacturing volume is expected this year? 
  [Millers] In my opinion, there is no basis for any 
discussion 
of a growth in manufacturing volume at present. The 
administration, already last year, promised to create the State 
Property Fund, Privatization Agency, and much more to promote 
the development of manufacturing. Of course, we can see that 
these promises have not been fulfilled. This means that the 
conditions for an upswing have not been created, and therefore 
there is no basis for a promising outlook on the future. 
Industrial development will start when attitudes towards 
manufacturing are changed. I have good contacts with many plant 
directors, and I know that the current situation in industry has 
not improved, because many places are only working three or four 
days per week. Naturally, many enterprise managers have now 
learned how to overcome the problems with selling their goods. 
But they have done so by dismissing many workers. The number of 
workers in manufacturing has declined by 30 or 40 percent. We 
are working less and producing less. 
  Another situation, which reinforces pessimism, is that 
privatization has been halted. In the past year, nothing has 
moved ahead. 
  [Selecks] We have to conclude that there is no perceptible 
movement towards a market economy, or capitalism. Therefore, 
instead -- are we preserving socialism? 
  [Millers] I think this administration is leftist. I think 
they are less competent than the preceding administration. Some 
sort of reforms were started before the necessary prerequisites 
were prepared. The Cabinet of Ministers does not comprehend the 
true status of the situation. I feel that it was a huge mistake 
to eliminate the Ministry of Industry. In two years, we had 
collected a competent group of people. These people were not 
stagnates, but rather specialists with practical work experience 
in business. In connection with the new reforms, they were all 
dismissed. I feel that in the administration's circle, there are 
very few people who are orientated in economics, let alone 
industry. How can you be a manager if you have never even 
walked through a single business enterprise? Theory 
is one matter, but -- practice is completely something else. 
When I accepted becoming Minister, I realized that this was a 
very sudden leap forward in my career. I was not ready for this 
and only accepted the proposal because I could not recommend 
anyone else in my place. I had to study long and hard to learn 
the specifics of my duties. The same thing happened with many 
other officials, who had suddenly jumped up the career ladder, 
without actually being prepared to do so. At that time, such 
actions could be understood and explained. Frankly speaking, it 
was a revolutionary situation, and it was necessary to act 
quickly and extraordinarily. But why does everything now have to 
be started all over again? That I don't understand. 
  [Selecks] Apparently, this is in following with the party 
loyalty principle. New forces have come to power, and they are 
attempting to place their own people in all positions of 
authority. 
  [Millers] Then, obviously, there is something wrong with the 
activities of the party, because rational, management-oriented 
people do not become party hacks. Politics, naturally, is 
related to economics. Unfortunately, for us, politics generally 
pertain to such questions as the citizenship law, national 
relations. In normal countries, politics deal with methods 
through which questions of economics are resolved, primarily the 
question of taxes, because that is the basis of all other 
questions. The attitude towards taxes shows how large a role you 
are granting to the state, for the community pot, and 
it determines how leftist or rightist you are. I hope that 
Latvia will understand the same with its politics, as does the 
whole world. 
  [Selecks] How would you explain that very few Latvians are 
engaging in business activities? 
  [Millers] Not by saying that the Latvian is lazier or 
dumber, 
as is often heard said. Present day business is such that it 
scares away Latvians. The first reason is taxes, 
which we already discussed. They are so high that a business 
which pays them honestly cannot survive. It becomes necessary to 
hide profits, to balance on the edge of breaking the law. Such a 
situation is not acceptable to many Latvians. A second factor, 
which scares them, is the crime situation. There is no hiding 
that. Financial authorities, various police and security forces 
are associated with criminal circles in some way, growing 
together. Working in such a situation, it is necessary to 
maintain your bearings, to know how to maneuver, in order to 
protect your earnings and your life. It is not easy to enter 
this circle from the outside. There are no instructions or 
lessons. And the third condition -- is corruption. I must admit 
that we could not resolve this problem in the preceding 
administration. But now, corruption has increased 
dramatically. Growing dramatically! Furthermore, this is all 
obvious to the naked eye. It is one of the factors that promotes 
non-payment of taxes and other violations of law. It is not 
permissible that laws are written for some, but -- not for 
others. If an official takes bribes, that means I do not have 
to pay taxes. 
  These three factors, in my opinion, are the main reason why 
Latvians shy away from business. If the former were to 
disappear, or at least decline, then Latvians could also start a 
business and achieve success. The many Latvians living in the 
West have demonstrated that, under civilized circumstances, 
members of our nationality are also able to be successful and 
prosperous businessmen. But business in Latvia is such that it 
is incompatible with the Latvian mentality. Those who are 
involved in it must feel some discomfort, because they have to 
make certain compromises.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Analysis: The 'Struggle' for Arms </F>
Exports and the Struggle for Power 'At the Top'"] 
  [Text] 
<H8>  1. </H8>
  The policy of the Yeltsin regime in the sphere of trade in 
Russian arms and military equipment has caused colossal 
political and economic damage to the long-term state interests 
of the Russian Federation. 
  Beginning in 1990 in Russia there has been a sharp reduction 
of export deliveries of arms and military equipment. By now 
military and technical cooperation with almost 30 foreign 
countries has been cut back or halted. In 1992, $2.3 billion 
worth of military products were sent abroad or one-third the 
amount in 1991. In 1993 a total of about $2 billion worth of 
high-technology military products were exported. While in 1993 
the share of the United States in the exports of arms and 
military equipment to developing countries reached 57 percent, 
Russia's share decreased to 5.5 percent! 
  The incompetence of the ruling "Demothieves" is striking! 
For 
example, $5.4 billion worth of military products were ordered in 
1992 from Russian enterprises of the military-industrial complex 
for export. This order was approved by Russian Federation 
Government Decree No. 171-11, of 17 March 1992, signed by Ye. 
Gaydar. Domestic plants manufactured $3.1 billion worth of arms 
and military equipment but only $1.1 billion worth was actually 
delivered abroad. 
  And so in recent years, because of the lack of sales of 
military products manufactured for export under unsubstantiated 
orders, the lost advantage exceeded $2.6 billion, which in 
October 1993 amounted to more than R3 trillion. But, in that 
same 1993, the Russian Ministry of Finance was unable to find 
financial resources to cover the debt to Russian peasants for 
delivery to the state of 9.2 million tonnes of wheat valued at 
more the R800 billion, for the construction of housing for 
military servicemen at R600 billion, for the development of the 
fuel and energy complex, or for solving other socioeconomic 
problems. 
<H8>  2. </H8>
  It says in the president's 18 November 1993 edict: "In order 
to provide for a state monopoly on exports and imports of arms 
and military equipment to the Russian Federation, Oboroneksport, 
Spetsvneshtekhnika, and the GUSK [Main Administration of Special 
Contracts] shall be withdrawn from the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations and merged into the Rosvooruzheniye company 
and placed under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation 
Government." 
  Thus public opinion in the country was told that a) the 
regime had reacted to the critical problem of exporting arms; b) 
it had "discovered" the main cause of this problem--the lack of 
unity of specialized exporters; and c) it had solved this 
problem by creating a consolidated state corporation. 
  But the real essence of the 18 November 1993 edict lay 
elsewhere. The sale of arms for export has always meant large 
amounts of commission in foreign currency for lobbyists and 
middlemen. Therefore various political groups in the regime have 
always carefully made sure that access to this feeding trough 
corresponded to the existing balance of forces at the very 
"top." For example, when Burbulis was especially close to B. 
Yeltsin he was given the opportunity to control arms exports 
through a specially created system of deputy ministers. The 
decline of Gennadiy Eduardovich led to a situation where new 
people appeared among the leaders of the specialized exporters. 
  In the view of the top bureaucracy, in November 1993 after 
the turbulent events of the preceding 10 months the time had 
come for another redistribution in front of the "trough" of 
military exports. 
<H8>  3. </H8>
  On 9 November 1993 the leader of the president's 
administration, S. Filatov, sent document No. ACh-5631 to O. 
Soskovets. Filatov wrote: "In my opinion, the question of 
military and technological cooperation between Russia and 
foreign countries requires a special review." What does he have 
in mind here when Yeltsin's 18 November special edict had 
already been signed? 
  Actually, in this document Filatov proposes that the 
government in conjunction with the administration share the 
"pie" of arms exports, that they act jointly against common 
"enemies," and that they outline certain rules of the game on 
this field under the new conditions. 
  The document addressed to Soskovets lists a number of 
organizations and dozens of names (from the deputy prime 
minister on down to the chief of the ministry department) who 
would be "scapegoats" (among them were Gaydar, Khizha, 
Karaoglanov, Deynekin, B. Fedorov, etc.). The selection was 
broad, which provided an opportunity for Filatov to bargain with 
Soskovets regarding whom to protect and how. 
  It says in the document: "Certain high officials from a 
number of ministries and the Russian Federation Government were 
drawn in to these illegal actions. In essence the commercial 
structures were 'fed' at the expense of state funds." Concrete 
examples follow after that. Soskovets might not like certain 
cases on this list (he had to consult with Chernomyrdin). Well, 
Filatov was prepared to be flexible! 
  On page 8 comes the conclusion: "All this indicates a lack 
of 
proper control on the part of the Russian Government over the 
implementation of its own state decisions--over arms trade." On 
page 9 there is an even more radical proposal: "To send the 
materials of the inspection for consideration and the adoption 
of measures to the Russian Federation procurator general." 
Naturally, the latter was an obvious bluff: The most important 
law of the bureaucracy is to avoid public scandals in its midst. 
<H8>  4. </H8>
  Ultimately the process of forming the Rosvooruzheniye state 
company was an attempt at some kind of compromise among the 
various groups. From the present "demi-establishment": V. 
Shumeyko (he okayed the edict on the creation of 
Rosvooruzheniye), O. Soskovets (he approved the edict on behalf 
of the government), and V. Chernomyrdin (he approved the 
company's charter)--these are the ones who immediately made 
their interests known. Moreover, the extremely busy First Deputy 
Prime Minister Soskovets assumed the post of chairman of the 
KVTS (Interdepartmental Commission on Military and Technical 
Cooperation, which is directly in charge of Rosvooruzheniye). A. 
Korzhakov, the chief of B. Yeltsin's personal guard, also 
announced his claims: He was given control over "observance of 
state interests" in the activity of the Rosvooruzheniye state 
committee. S. Filatov, whose relations with Korzhakov were not 
very good, got Ye. Shaposhnikov appointed as the president's 
representative on the Rosvooruzheniye state committee. And 
Rosvooruzheniye itself was headed by General Ye. Samoylov--one 
of Shumeyko and Grachev's men. 
  The following fact provides a fuller picture of the balance 
of various groups. For the sake of "foreign currency funds 
expenditure control" Rosvooruzheniye was to conduct its activity 
through authorized banks. Even Vneshtorgbank of the Russian 
Federation, which handles two-thirds of the operations for 
government agreements, was not included among these privileged 
banks. And the ones that were authorized were Menatep, 
Most-Bank, Intermed, and the Moscow National Bank. Anyone who is 
aware of the group whose interests are reflected by these 
commercial banks can guess who is receiving the most from the 
business of exporting arms. 
  The intrigue (or affair) with arms exports continues at 
the very top. Against the background of the degradation of 
high-technology branches of the military-industrial complex, one 
can understand why the "Demothieves" hate Stalin!

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bill Clinton in Moscow: Analysis and </F>
Evaluation"] 
  [Text] On the eve of B. Clinton's visit to the Russian 
Federation (in January 1994) a large memo was prepared for him, 
"On the Sociopolitical and Economic Situation in Russia at the 
End of 1993 and the Beginning of 1994." 
  It was noted in the economics section that the 1993 Russian 
Federation GNP had decreased by 18 percent, and the rates of 
uncompensated decline of the industrial-production potential 
decreased 2.3 times more rapidly than in 1992, which was 
evidence of an irreversible decline of reserves of accumulation 
and reproduction in many branches. In three months of 1993 the 
decline of production reached the greatest amount in all the 
time of the reforms (35 percent). Monetary measures for 
financial and credit stabilization led to a "stagflation 
tailspin" that was continually perpetuated with each round. This 
enabled the West basically to solve strategic problems: 
demilitarizing Russia's economy, adapting the resource potential 
of the CIS countries to the existing world economic system, and 
making it impossible to rapidly restore Russia's 
military-industrial complex in the event that forces unfriendly 
to the West were to come to power. 
  At the same time it was noted that the inadequate 
"elasticity" of Russia's leadership regarding U.S. 
recommendations to follow the political technologies of the 
transition period led to a situation where the possibility that 
ultra-nationalistic forces would come to power in Russia became 
more than real. The economic situation in the country could 
contribute to this to a significant degree if B. Yeltsin's 
regime continues to pursue its present economic policy. In this 
case the stabilizing influence will reduce inflation by the end 
of 1994 to 3-5 percent per month, there will be a significant 
reduction of the interest rate on interbank credit, and the 
exchange rate with the dollar, which depends on the world parity 
balance of prices of the main raw material goods exported from 
Russia, will be reinforced. 
  This, in turn, will lead to a decline of the GNP by another 
20-25 percent, complete destructuring of Russia's economy, the 
elimination of exports with the exception of energy sources in 
keeping with GATT quotas, and investments mainly in fuel 
extracting branches, the infrastructures that serve them, trade, 
and service, as well as the degradation of private production 
and the banking system. According to data contained in the 
report, unemployment will increase to 15-18 million (including 
hidden). The differentiation in incomes will amount to 30 units. 
  There is a real threat of an economic "stagflation infarct" 
during the May-June 1994 period: the effect of the direct 
halting of the movement of production prices, because of the 
rapidly growing shortfalls of deliveries of resources based on 
the explosive growth of nonpayments, which, in turn, occurred 
because of the absence of the regular portion of preferential 
credit for reproduction, resonating with the seasonal background 
of procurements for agricultural work and the regular price hike 
in order to increase profitability and make up for the 
consequences of the high inflation. 
  But such a development of events is not likely to occur 
since 
the impact of the strongest social factor, reflected in the form 
of political pressure from the State Duma and the powerful 
lobbying of the production part of the government, will force 
Russia's leadership in April-May 1994 to resort to another 
inflationary invigoration of production resulting from pumping 
money into the national economy through preferential credit, as 
occurred in June-July 1992 and May-June 1993, each time with 
more severe sociopolitical consequences. 
  Such half-measures at a lower circle of the "stagflationary 
spiral" will promote a further considerable reduction of the 
political influence of reformist forces as a whole. Moreover, 
they will significantly weaken the forces of that part of the 
political elite on whose assumption of power in the post-Yeltsin 
period the U.S. leadership was tacitly placing its bets. The 
transfer of power was to have begun in September-October 1993 
and it was to have ended president. 
  These American recommendations were presented to individuals 
close to President B. Yeltsin who formulate the country's 
domestic political policy, and they expressed their agreement. 
It was a matter of a comprehensive program for "stage-by-stage 
adaptation" of the economic and sociopolitical situation in 
Russia to world economic and political realities, developed on 
the basis of the theory of "discreteness of periods of crisis 
pressure" and "shock-absorbing stage-like nation of social 
adjustment," geared to Russian parameters (the model of 
seasonal-diametric periodicity of the political process and 
imposed upon it a stage-by-stage, "gradual-graduated" transition 
to a new socioeconomic quality with "social respites" at each 
"stage" of the reform). 
  The program included a gradual transfer of power to groups 
of 
the Russian elite who are loyal to the West and who were 
supposed to crowd out extremist, nationalist, and communist 
forces with effective political and sociolegal reforms, being in 
"soft opposition to Yeltsin." These economic transformations 
were to be based on Yavlinskiy's program of "bisectoral 
planning-market structurization of the national economy" on the 
basis of political stabilization--Shakhray's regional-centrist 
policy. 
  It was also noted in the report that under Russia's concrete 
conditions, in addition to relying on specific elite groupings 
and taking into account the personal peculiarities of the 
president of the Russian Federation, it is extremely important 
to continue to work actively with those closest to him, meaning 
above all A. Korzhakov, E. Pain, and Yu. Baturin. 
  Korzhakov and Baturin have been exerting the most influence 
on the president recently. They have practically completely 
monopolized all channels of information of any kind, including 
that from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and intelligence, and 
they have taken full charge of the final editing of drafts of 
legislative and administrative acts okayed by leaders of 
government departments and signed by the president. 
  If Korzhakov and Ilyushin control the 
administrative-information block of the distributive-state 
infrastructure, Yu. Baturin is the key figure in the formation 
of the strategic line of the head of state. According to figures 
in the report, Yu. Baturin is the "architect" and main "pusher" 
of all the most radical political decisions adopted by the 
president in 1993. 
  Referring to the opinions of the aforementioned individuals 
from B. Yeltsin's inner circle, the latter is prepared to listen 
to recommendations from his Western friends concerning a 
reasonable adjustment of the economic and political reforms, but 
he will take real steps only if he has no opposition at all. No 
pressure on himself or apparent concessions can be expected from 
the president, especially at the present time when he is 
convinced that he is supported by power structures that are 
faithful to him. 
  The report gives assessments of the "Zhirinovskiy 
phenomenon." It was necessary for the ruling groupings to 
support this phenomenon for a certain amount of time (not 
Zhirinovskiy, but precisely his phenomenon). Here they assume 
that without Zhirinovskiy his faction would rapidly become a 
branch of the Russian Federation Communist Party. As long as 
Zhirinovskiy is present he will not allow this but during the 
time of his parliamentary activity he will completely discredit 
himself and will not be able to run seriously for the post of 
president. Additionally, his presence will contribute to support 
from the West for Russia's president. And, conversely, 
Zhirinovskiy's rapid departure from the arena will considerably 
strengthen the position of neo-communist forces and statesmen 
and could make their assumption of power a reality. The report 
recommended to Bill Clinton: 
  that he personally exert a constant influence on Russia's 
president since B.N. has a sharply negative reaction to 
influence from third parties; 
  taking into account the situation that has developed, 
recommendations must be aimed at adjusting the reforms in the 
direction of social priorities, expanding the social base of 
support for the president, firing the most odious figures, 
providing more effective publicity for economic and political 
reforms, etc.; 
  U.S. political leadership should expand the range of 
interaction with the most diverse political forces in Russia, 
taking into account the complexity and unpredictability of the 
development of the situation; 
  special attention should be devoted to work with all the 
"elite" groupings in the high echelons of power; 
  in parallel, active work should be done to arrange 
cooperation with other CIS countries in order not to allow the 
restoration of another confederation; 
  taking into account the economic situation and other 
difficulties in the Russian Federation, within the framework of 
diplomatic etiquette, there should be a certain amount of 
strictness and consistency in the achievement of results needed 
in the West. The main purpose of Clinton's visit to the Russian 
Federation was worded as "to achieve results favorable for the 
national interests of the United States" (within the framework 
of the doctrine of "Partnership for Peace") and to keep Russia 
on the track of "democratic" transformations. Of course Clinton 
and his circle also planned to raise the "political" rating of 
the U.S. President and have the maximum possible "favorable" 
effect on the population of Russia. Clinton managed to achieve 
practically all of the goals that were set. The main results of 
his visit amounted to the following: 
  he forced the Russian Federation to accept the majority of 
his conditions while at the same time avoiding any commitments 
to render any kind of appreciable economic aid to Russia; 
  he promised the Russian Federation president to make 
reimbursement for "all costs of dismantling nuclear weapons in 
Ukraine." More than $1 billion guaranteed to Kravchuk for 
dismantling nuclear warheads will be paid to Russia for 
delivering oil, gas, etc. to Kiev; 
  as compensation for this service, he achieved agreement from 
the Russian Federation to participate in the privatization of 
Russian enterprises (the possibilities of acquiring shares for 
hard currency) "to be credited to repayment of part of the 
immense Russian debt to the United States"; 
  B. Yeltsin's attempts to obtain special advantages in 
relations with the CIS countries were roundly rejected by 
Clinton. But he made it clearly understood that because of 
national-ethnic, economic, and other factors the United States 
would not object to the development of relations between the 
Russian Federation and Belarus. 
  Clinton approved the personnel reshuffling carried out 
before 
his visit (Yakovlev, Baturin, Chubays) and, out of "essential 
tactical" considerations, he agreed to the resignation of Gaydar 
and his team. 
  The corresponding strategic assessments and recommendations 
were submitted to the U.S. President in December 1993. The 
events that occurred during the past four months show that the 
American program for influencing "Moscow's policy" continues to 
be implemented fairly effectively with respect to its basic 
points.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Sakhalin-2--A Precedent"] </F>
  [Text] At the present time negotiations on the Sakhalin-2 
project are entering a decisive phase. Acting as a foreign 
partner is the 4-M consortium, in which the American side is 
represented by the companies Marathon Oil Company, and McDermott 
International Inc. and the Japanese side by Mitsubishi and 
Mitsui. 
  The essence of the project is to develop gas reserves on 
Sakhalin and carry out its initial refining with subsequent sale 
to a foreign consumer, the main one ready to play this role 
being South Korea and also, possibly, Japan after the year 2005. 
The implementation of the project is intended to take several 
decades. The cost of investments is estimated at $6 billion U.S. 
  Negotiations on this contract have already been underway for 
a long time. They became especially active during the time Ye. 
Gaydar was in the post of Russian Government acting deputy prime 
minister. 
  For the foreign partners the situation was exacerbated by 
the 
circumstance that the South Koreans became a dangerous 
competitor to 4-M. In particular, the Palmko Korn company, with 
support from the South Korea Ministry of Energy and Resources, 
offered the Russian Government its services for participating in 
the development of the Sakhalin-2 project. The political aspect 
was important here: South Korea did not want to obtain gas from 
Russia through the Japanese. 
  Ye. Gaydar and certain members of the Russian Federation 
Government took advantage of the heightened competitive struggle 
fairly successfully. They did not give final guarantees to any 
of the parties but still they gave their assurances that they 
were ready to cooperate with each of them. To a certain degree 
by these actions they managed to stimulate among them 
competition that was advantageous to Russia. But at the same 
time the most highly placed figures in the Russian Government 
received on a regular basis fairly large "honoraria" for the 
corresponding lobbying efforts. 
  The proposals from the South Koreans have unquestionable 
financial and also political advantages over the 4-M version. 
This pertains in particular to the higher profitability, more 
rapid return in hard currency, Russia's retention of possession 
of both the deposit itself and the gas that is sold. But because 
of their more energetic measures, including financial ones, by 
the middle of 1993, 4-M representatives had managed to sway a 
number of the leading members of the Russian Federation 
Government in their direction. The Russian Federation Supreme 
Soviet at that time received a fairly detailed documentary 
report on the degree of "personal involvement" of the 
aforementioned individuals in the process of rendering decisive 
assistance from 4-M in the realization of their plans. Some of 
these documents were to have been made public were it not for 
the use of gunfire on the White House. 
  At the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994, even in spite 
of the reshuffling and changes in the Russian Federation 
Government, the draft proposed by 4-M began to receive growing 
support. One of its main lobbyists was Sakhalin Governor Ye. 
Krasnoyarov. He worked very hard in the government, mainly in 
the Russian Federation Ministry of Fuel and Energy. In an 
unofficial setting representatives of the consortium repeatedly 
emphasized that the governor was their "main motive force." 
  The question of the Sakhalin-2 project was discussed several 
times in various expert commissions of the Russian Government 
and on the whole received support. They began to coordinate 
legal and technical details of the official contract, which 
could be signed between the Russian Federation Government and 
4-M in the near future. 
  At the same time the 4-M leadership is afraid that the State 
Duma, especially with its present membership, is capable of 
stopping the implementation of this project. One of the main 
provisions of the project is that the foreign side (4-M) will be 
given the right to own part of the Russian gas which, according 
to existing legislation, belongs to the state. In this 
connection there is a need to change the laws of the Russian 
Federation, which is the prerogative of the State Duma. 
  Taking into account the situation that has developed, 4-M 
has 
begun to work out measures for exerting the corresponding 
influence on the Duma and creating the necessary channels of 
influence on its key figures. A most active role in this work is 
played by Ye. Krasnoyarov and also certain government 
representatives, including from the Ministry of Fuel and Energy. 
The leader of this ministry himself, Yu. Shafranik, is in favor 
of beginning to implement the Sakhalin-2 project as quickly as 
possible. The ministry's main demand is that the foreign 
partners actually be ready to deliver the necessary investments 
for the project. 
  But in the given stage 4-M is not prepared to allot the 
required investments. Within the corporation it is mainly 
Japanese companies that are to make these investments. But 
because of the ambiguous development of the domestic political 
situation in Russia, the current condition of Japanese-Russian 
relations, the fact that Japan will not have an additional need 
for gas until the year 2005, and a number of other factors, 
Mitsubishi and Mitsui so far are not ready to make the final 
decision to allot investments in the Sakhalin-2 project. 
  In this situation the main task for 4-M, and mainly its 
American part, is to attempt to change the existing Russian 
legislation with respect to ownership of natural resources in 
the interests of the West and the largest transnational 
companies operating in the sphere of extraction and processing 
of minerals. It cannot be ruled out that under the cover of the 
future possibilities of realizing Sakhalin-2 and with the help 
of 4M these circles will try to push through the State Duma a 
decision which will create a precedent and could lead to a 
radical change in Russian legislation. The main aspect of these 
changes is the possibility for foreign legal entities to own 
Russia's natural resources. 
  This step would open up new possibilities for foreign 
capital 
to pursue a policy of increasing the dependence of the Russian 
Federation on the leading states of the world.

<F P=106> [Article by the Center of Sociological Analysis of </F>
International Conflicts of the Independent Russian Institute of 
Social and National Problems: "Emigration, Migration, Migraine"] 
  [Text] On 1 December 1992 470,000 refugees and 
800,000 forced resettlers were registered in Russia. In reality, 
however, in the opinion of the heads of the Russian Federal 
Migration Service (FMS), there were around 1.5 million of them 
at that time. In November 1993, Tatyana Regent, chief of the 
FMS, reported at a session of the Presidium of the Russian 
Federation Council of Ministers that in 1993 Russia received 
around 2 million forced resettlers and economic migrants. 
Official sources estimate the number of refugees and migrants in 
Russia to be between 1.7 million and 2 million. That figure 
includes not only those who registered their status as a 
refugee, but also individuals who did not register after 
arriving from other independent countries. 
  The share of non-Russian ethnic groups among the total 
number of immigrants in Russia, according to calculations by the 
experts, amounts to 30 to 45 percent. 
<H5>  Refugees and Forced Resettlers in Russia </H5>
  The most active and large-scale migration of national, 
principally Russian-speaking, minorities, and frequently 
indigenous residents, is presently observed as coming mainly 
from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Tajikistan, and Moldova. In 
1992-1993, for example, some 800,000 persons left Georgia, a 
third of whom are Georgians. As many as 778,500 individuals 
departed Tajikistan, according to incomplete data. The stream of 
migrants from Latvia, Estonia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and 
Kazakhstan is also quite significant. 
  All those who have that right and apply to local organs of 
the migration service are subject to registration as refugees. 
  The laws of the Russian Federation on refugees and on forced 
resettlers, adopted on 19 February 1993, provide the following 
formal-legal definitions of the corresponding categories of 
people. 
  A refugee is any individual who has entered or plans to 
enter 
the territory of the Russian Federation who does not hold 
citizenship of the Russian Federation, and who was compelled to 
leave or has the intention of leaving the place of his permanent 
residence on the territory of another country as the result of 
violence committed against him or because of persecution in 
other forms, or because of a real threat of being subjected to 
violence or other persecution because of race or nationality, 
religion, or language, or affiliation with a certain social 
group or because of political convictions. 
  An individual who has committed a crime against peace, 
humanity, or some other heinous premeditated crime cannot be 
recognized as a refugee. 
  A forced resettler is a citizen of the Russian Federation 
who 
was forced to leave or has the intention of leaving the place of 
his permanent residence on the territory of another country or 
on the territory of the Russian Federation because of violence 
or persecution in other forms against himself or members of his 
family or because of a real threat of being subjected to 
persecution due to racial or national affiliation, religious 
beliefs, language, or membership in a certain social group or 
because of political convictions causing hostile campaigns 
directed against individuals or groups of individuals, massive 
violations of public order or other circumstances that 
substantially infringe on the rights of the individual. 
  An individual not holding citizenship of the Russian 
Federation who left the place of his permanent residence on the 
territory of the Russian Federation for reasons listed in the 
first part of the article on resettlers may also be recognized 
as a forced resettler. 
  A citizen of the former USSR, who resides on the territory 
of 
a republic that was a part of the former USSR, who arrived in 
the Russian Federation under circumstances indicated in the 
first part of this article and who acquired the citizenship of 
the Russian Federation while on the territory of the Russian 
Federation may be recognized as a forced resettler. 
  An individual who has committed a crime against peace and 
humanity, or is guilty of some other heinous premeditated crime 
cannot be recognized as a forced resettler. (See the law of the 
Russian Federation on refugees and the law of the Russian 
Federation on forced resettlers in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 1993, No 
54, 20 March, p 4). 
  In accordance with these criteria, the status of a refugee 
is 
currently granted to those arriving in Russia primarily from 
Tajikistan, Moldova, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, that is, from hot 
spots where armed clashes occur. In addition, at present the 
status of a refugee may be obtained by individuals arriving from 
Latvia and Estonia, where they are becoming individuals without 
citizenship. They have now been joined by refugees from 
Ingushetia and North Ossetia who have left places of residence 
in the Prigorodniy Rayon. Refugees from Chechnya and Dagestan 
are also arriving in southern and central regions of Russia. 
Individuals arriving from other regions, as a rule, receive the 
status of forced resettlers. 
  In Moscow and its environs, as well as in St. Petersburg, 
only those are now being officially registered who have 
relatives there agreeing to register the refugees to their 
housing area. 
  The new federal migration program has now been elaborated 
together with drafts of supplements and changes pertaining to 
laws on refugees and on forced resettlers which refine and 
concretize criteria used to determine their status. The 
proposals have been submitted to the Federal Assembly. 
  Until now, registration was not carried out at the time that 
the border of the Russian Federation was crossed, which was 
explained to a great degree by a lack of facilities on the 
border. An individual intending to obtain the status of a 
refugee or a forced resettler must personally apply to the local 
organ of the migration service immediately upon arrival on the 
territory of the Russian Federation. A refugee may not be 
forcibly returned to the country which he left. The migration 
service must examine the application within three days and issue 
the applicant an appropriate document. After receiving the 
document determining his status, a migrant acquires the same 
political and social rights as a Russian citizen and is eligible 
to receive assistance from state structures (grants, credit for 
housing construction, medical and employment services) as well 
as various privileges (interest-free long-term credit). 
  A presidential decree on measures for conduct of migration 
control was signed on 16 December 1993, in accordance with which 
it is planned to conduct the registration of migrants at the 
time they cross the borders of Russia, in airports and at 
railway stations. Preparations are currently under way to 
implement that decree. 
  The opinion of experts on the number of migrants in all 
categories (refugees, forced resettlers, economic migrants) in 
Russia differ from official and unofficial figures of the 
migration service. In the view of some of them, at the present 
time this figure is around 4 to 5 million persons. The volume of 
illegal migration is estimated at more than 500,000 persons per 
month. According to predictions by specialists, a minimum of 2 
million to 3 million persons, and a maximum of 4 to 6 million 
may arrive in 1994 on the territory of Russia from the near 
abroad and several autonomous republics of the Russian 
Federation (North Caucasus) (some experts predict 10 million at 
the minimum), along with over 100,000 coming from the far abroad. 
<H5>  Russians as a National Minority </H5>
  The most unfavorable living conditions for Russian national 
minorities has developed in the region including Azerbaijan, 
Georgia, the republics of Central Asia, and in Russia--Dagestan 
and Chechnya. These regions account for up to 80 percent of all 
Russian emigration. From one-third to a half of the almost 
800,000 former local Russian residents have already departed the 
most unstable Muslim republics of the former USSR--Tajikistan 
and Azerbaijan. In the past four years (1990-1993), for 
instance, the Russian-speaking population of Tajikistan actually 
shrank by one-half: Of the almost 390,000 Russians (according to 
the 1989 census) fewer than 200,000 remain. 
  Tajikistan, where practically 100 percent of the remaining 
Russian residents intend to emigrate; Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, 
and Kazakhstan, where 60 percent of the nonindigenous residents 
are ready to emigrate; Armenia, where 70 percent of the 
population in the republic intends to emigrate outside the 
country, mainly to Russia and the United States; Latvia and 
Estonia, where 80 percent of the Russian-speaking population 
hold a negative view of the state of interethnic relations and 
are ready to emigrate; all have the greatest emigration 
potential for Russia at the present time. As indicated above, 
the listed countries should also include Azerbaijan, Georgia, 
and Moldova, where the number of those wishing to emigrate, both 
Russians and indigenous residents, is steadily growing. 
<H5>  The Migrational Balance of the CIS </H5>
  At present, it is possible to speak about the substantive 
change in the situation in the migrational balance of the former 
Union republics. Beginning in 1993, immigration into Russia has 
increasingly exceeded emigration from it. For instance, by 
comparison with 1991, the number of people entering Latvia from 
Russia and other former Union republics for permanent residence 
decreased in 1993 by a factor of 2.7, from 12,600 to 4,600, 
whereas the number of those departing Latvia during that period 
increased by a factor of 2.2--from 23,900 to 51,800. In the 
opinion of some experts, at the present time the correlation 
between immigrants and emigrants in the migrational balance of 
Russia with other former Union republics may be expressed as a 
ratio of 8:2. 
  Departures from Russia for Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, 
Moldova, and Tajikistan have practically ceased. There was a 
considerable drop in departures to Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and 
Kazakhstan. At the present time, fewer people depart for Russia 
than enter only in Ukraine and Belarus. In the opinion of the 
experts, emigration and immigration streams will become equal in 
Lithuania in 1994. The return of Estonians to Estonia, primarily 
from Russia, as well as from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and 
Abkhazia continues at a rate of approximately 600 persons a year. 
  At the present time, all of the former Union republics are 
experiencing severe economic difficulties. That circumstance 
significantly diminishes the streams of economic migration, 
which always existed in the former Soviet Union, and the primary 
role is acquired by refugees and forced resettlers for social, 
national, and political motives. During 1990-1993, the share of 
Russian residents in Kazakhstan decreased from 40.8 percent to 
36.4 percent. This datum is evidence that in the superficially 
peaceful Kazakhstan there are growing social and political 
tensions. 
<H5>  Causes and Consequences of the Influx of Refugees and </H5>
Resettlers 
  Immigrants who left for Russia from Georgia, Azerbaijan, 
Moldova, and Tajikistan almost all indicated the threat of 
physical violence as their principal motive for coming to 
Russia. The same reason was indicated by around 50 percent of 
immigrants who left Central Asia. 
  Migrants from the Baltic countries point to problems with 
acquisition of citizenship (in Latvia and Estonia) and 
concurrent discrimination in education, at the place of 
employment, in social security, and so on. Those leaving Central 
Asia also speak of day-to-day crime against the nonindigenous 
population, and add the Islamization of the way of life to the 
listed reasons. 
  Adoption of new laws on citizenship in a number of countries 
on the territory of the former USSR, as a rule, stimulates 
emigration among the Russian population. Eighty percent of the 
Russian population in Estonia and Latvia, for instance, wish to 
leave those countries specifically because of the new 
citizenship laws adopted there. Some 40,000 Russian-speaking 
residents of the Estonian city of Narva, or two-thirds of all of 
its residents, want to leave for that reason. Rejection of a 
regulation on the possibility of dual citizenship is prompting 
the exit of Russians from Kazakhstan. At the same time, 
recognition of dual citizenship in Turkmenistan diminished 
emigration of the nonindigenous population out of that republic. 
  The massive influx of refugees into individual regions (for 
instance, in the south of Russia) throws virtually all of the 
social and economic infrastructures and almost all of the 
ancillary support systems out of balance. The food problem is 
acutely exacerbated, and the social security system cannot 
withstand the growing load. The situation in the sphere of 
consumption is deteriorating. There is an increase in crime. The 
situation with housing becomes much more difficult, and there is 
a catastrophic shortage of it not only for local residents (in 
Russia 10 million people are on the waiting list for state 
housing), but also for hundreds of thousands of military 
personnel returning to Russia from the near and far abroad, to 
say nothing of refugees. The state of affairs on the employment 
market is growing increasingly more tense. Possibilities for 
finding work are shrinking rapidly. 
  All this compels one to view growing immigration as a 
potentially explosive issue. In Kuban, for instance, the number 
of migrants already comprises 15 percent of the kray population 
and beyond 15 percent, according to the theory of threshold 
figures, the normal and controllable course of events ends. 
  The situation is further aggravated by the fact that the 
government of the Russian Federation is unable to offer migrants 
really effective assistance. A total of 43 billion rubles [R] 
were appropriated for the Russian FMS for 1994, when the Moscow 
migration service alone needs R56 billion. For minimal 
realization of laws on refugees and on forced resettlers, R165 
billion is needed, in January 1993 prices, while full 
realization of these laws in the same prices requires R240 
billion.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Iskandaryan: "Hot Spot. Three </F>
Questions From Tskhinvali or the Trigger Has Not Been Pulled 
Yet...Russia Is Tired of Bearing Her Cross in the Transcaucasus. 
But There Are No Alternatives. Who Else?..."] 
  [Text] It seems the world has already managed to forget 
about the events that occurred only two years ago in South 
Ossetia. The subject of war, as it relates to Georgia, has been 
enriched recently by the bloody war in Abkhazia and the battle 
with the Zviadists in western Georgia. 
  Today, intensive negotiations are being conducted concerning 
regulation of the situation around Abkhazia, but the fate of 
South Ossetia continues to be merely a subject of academic 
discussions. Yet, the internal situation in the self-proclaimed 
republic is extremely difficult, and the reason for this is the 
uncertainty of its fate. This is understood quite well in 
Tskhinvali by practically everyone I was able to speak with. But 
destinies, including of this territory, are not decided in the 
capital. 
  The recent Supreme Council elections of the South Ossetian 
Republic made it possible to form a leadership consisting of 
relatively moderate politicians. In a fairly short period of 
time, a number of high officials of South Ossetia repeatedly 
announced rather loudly the desirability and need to begin the 
negotiation process with Georgia. Either there was no answer 
from Tbilisi at all or it was interpreted as negative. 
  Thus, the head of the Georgian state, Eduard Shevardnadze, 
having evaluated the new membership in the South Ossetian 
parliament as "people with whom one could work," subsequently 
stated that they did not recognize the elections or the Supreme 
Council as such. 
<H5>  In Dagomys There Is an Elder, but What About Tskhinvali? </H5>
  In the agreements that, on Russia's initiative and with her 
direct participation, were signed on 24 June 1992 in Dagomys by 
the leaders of Georgia and approved by the leaders of South 
Ossetia and the Chairman of the Supreme Council of North 
Ossetia, the point about ceasefire, separating the opposing 
sides, and introducing peacekeeping forces into the zone of 
conflict was the major one but not the only one. 
  The Dagomys agreements stipulated that compliance would be 
overseen by a specially created Mixed Oversight Commission (SKK) 
made up of representatives of Russia, Georgia, and North 
Ossetia. In the first stage of the activity, it turned out that 
a mechanism had been created that was fairly successful for such 
cases. 
  The Mixed Oversight Commission handled many problems, 
including the then critical problem of releasing or exchanging 
prisoners of war and supplying the local population with food 
and fuel, and coordinated the operations for confiscating 
weapons from illegal armed formations. Unnoticed at first 
glance, but extremely important in the commission's activity 
today, is the fact that its decisions were reported to the high 
officials of Russia and Georgia, which made it possible to react 
promptly to the change in the situation. 
  Approximately a year ago, the Mixed Oversight Commission 
quietly faded out of sight without leaving a trace. They are 
trying to keep track of and analyze the problems of the war torn 
land and its residents today through short inspection trips from 
Moscow and Tbilisi, and there is no system to these visits, just 
as so far there are no apparent results. 
  In South Ossetia, any kind of news or rumor about an 
inspection spreads immediately, and the words of one of the 
secondary guests from the Russian Government to the effect that 
"out of every three rubles Russia will give Georgia, one is 
intended for South Ossetia" initially evoked euphoria. As always 
in such cases, the euphoria was quickly replaced by 
disenchantment because so far the republic has received neither 
money nor construction materials to restore the practically 
destroyed economy. 
  Nobody in Tskhinvali believes the promises of Georgian 
visitors at all. The recently appointed minister of affairs of 
Shida Kartli (this--Inner Kartli--is what they call South 
Ossetia in Georgia), Vazha Khachapuridze, visits only the 
Georgian villages around Tskhinvali. And, those rare guests from 
Tbilisi who go to the actual capital of South Ossetia give 
various figures and dates. 
  The last sum of a half billion was promised a month ago. At 
the same time, it must be recalled that almost a year and a half 
ago a special multilateral commission determined the sum of 
damages caused by the war to South Ossetia at R43 billion. At 
the exchange rate at that time, this was almost $25 million. Now 
it is half as much. But, even in the aforementioned Dagomys 
agreements, the Georgian leaders promised to pay for two-thirds 
of the damages. 
  If one keeps in mind the current lamentable condition of the 
Georgian economy and its complete dependence on Russian aid, 
although it has not been received so far, one can draw the 
conclusion that the entire sum will lie on Russia's shoulders 
one way or another. 
<H5>  The Russian-Georgian Border--Is It the Ossetia-Ossetian </H5>
Border? 
  In April of last year, the Russian parliament at the time 
adopted the Law on the State Border of the Russian Federation. 
The demarcation with the so-called nearby foreign countries was 
difficult, and the innocent bystander might be reminded of 
anything at all but a well-considered state policy. 
  First, the Russian border guards were withdrawn from the 
Transcaucasus to the Northern Caucasus where it was decided to 
create new "boundaries of the Motherland." So, they organized 
the North Caucasian border district with a staff in Stavropol, 
which is far away even from the new boundaries. 
  The development of the basic forces has proceeded in various 
ways. In some places, it has not occurred at all--for example, 
in the Chechen Republic, which according to the new Russian 
Constitution is a part of the Russian Federation. And, in some 
places, it has proceeded with enviable acceleration and the 
unenviable quality that traditionally corresponds to 
acceleration such as, for example, in North Ossetia. 
  Border guards have had to be stationed in the republic, 
which 
has little land and many people and is already impossibly 
overloaded with troops. The traditional Caucasian hospitality 
can hardly compensate for the absence of the necessary quantity 
of barracks and staff premises or provide any apartments or even 
rooms in dormitories for officers. 
  The second stage of the construction of the new Russian 
border led to a situation where now our border guards are again 
guarding the outer borders of the former USSR in the 
Transcaucasus. The only place they have not moved in yet is 
Azerbaijan. The name of the border district has also changed--it 
is now the Special Caucasian Border District. 
  It turns out that the Russian Federation now has two 
concentric borders. And, there is a gaping hole in the nearer 
one--Chechnya. And, the border in North Ossetia is being 
reinforced in a planned way. One of Fazil Iskander's heroes 
could not understand at all-- is Abkhazia Adzharia or not. It is 
also difficult to understand in real life what the Russian 
Border Troops are guarding at the northern Russian portal of the 
Rokskiy Tunnel--the border between Russia and Georgia or between 
one Ossetia and the other. 
  The state border that passes through the middle of the 
territory populated by just one ethnic group evokes no 
enthusiasm in either North or South Ossetia, but it is not 
causing any special protest either. From time to time. So far, 
the law on the border has not been fully enforced here, as, 
incidentally, is also the case in South Dagestan, on the land of 
the Lezgin people. With the border strip, the border regime, and 
special passes for local residents. 
  In South Ossetia, even now, they think that the Russian post 
with the armored equipment at the entrance to the area was 
placed here to close off the border in the event of "special 
circumstances." And, border and customs control is carried out 
not here but several kilometers below, on the territory of North 
Ossetia, where its own border personnel are also located. 
  Another paradox noted in connection with the border 
innovations is the implementation of the agreement on service in 
Russian border troops by citizens of sovereign states of 
Transcaucasia. This decision is rather strange in and of itself. 
But, there are cases where it obviously cannot work, and this 
apparently should be stipulated, especially at the high 
legislative or governmental level. 
  Who, for example, should protect that same Rokskiy crossing 
from the South Ossetia side--citizens of this territory or 
recruits from Georgia? It is quite clear what could happen if it 
were the Georgians. After all, the residents of South Ossetia 
are afraid not only of closing the border in and of itself but 
of what could happen as a result of a new outburst of military 
activity. 
<H5>  Which Is More Important--Moscow or the CSCE? </H5>
  After Russia's actual withdrawal from political 
participation 
in the South Ossetian fate and supervision of the implementation 
of the agreements that were reached with such difficulty, 
participants in the CSCE mission tried to fill this sacred 
position. It would seem that the fact of keeping peace is 
important in and of itself, and whoever ends up first here is 
not so important. But, as one can see from a brief acquaintance 
with the situation in South Ossetia and its environs, nobody can 
replace Russia in this region. And, it would even be strange to 
think otherwise. Such is the case with the CSCE as well. 
  Periodically the CSCE in Tbilisi and Tskhinvali put forth 
various plans to begin the negotiating process, but the example 
of Abkhazia, which is appropriate in this case, shows one thing. 
Namely: None of the countries participating in the CSCE or the 
United Nations are ready to actually pay with money or the 
health of their subjects for the peace process in the outskirts 
of the former USSR. None of the great powers except for Russia, 
since it is the only one vitally interested in real peace along 
its nearby boundaries. And, in this region, Russia carries more 
weight than all the rest of the countries of the CSCE taken 
together. Without Russia's participation, obviously, the problem 
of South Ossetia is not likely to be solved. 
  A member of the State Duma who visited South Ossetia 
recently, Aleksandr Dzasokhov, advised the chairman of 
parliament, Lyudvig Chibirov, without rejecting aid from the 
mission of the CSCE, still to place any real hopes in Moscow. 
  It seems that only Moscow is capable of breathing life into 
the plans for beginning real Ossetian-Georgian regulation. Well, 
Russia was the initiator of the ceasefire, and she apparently 
will have to continue to bear her cross. Otherwise, the brief 
period of relative peace in South Ossetia could come to an end. 
Out of a flimsy peace, it is necessary to try to make a strong 
one.

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Agafonov, chief of Nevel Customs Post, by </F>
Yu. Kozlov; place and date not given: "Fifty-Five Customs Agents 
on a Transparent Border"] 
  [Text] As far back as I can recall, Belarus has 
always existed more prosperously and better than Russia. At any 
rate better than Nevel Rayon in Pskov Oblast, which adjoins it. 
Formerly the Nevel side had poverty, hunger, and a shortage of 
gasoline, while on the Belarus side it was not really abundance, 
but definitely better. Traffic moved principally in one 
direction--from hungry Pskov Oblast into Vitebsk Oblast. But the 
link of time has disintegrated. Such a suddenly acquired 
indisputable factor of independence as the Belarus hare, which 
at first could be exchanged for 10 Russian rubles, was called 
upon to protect the higher standard of living and at the same 
time restrain Pskov Oblast residents from emptying Belarusian 
shelves. 
  At present the situation along the new Russian borders 
is completely different. The hare lost considerable 
weight--seven for a ruble. Even though store shelves in Belarus 
are hopelessly empty, the flow of goods still continues to flow 
into Russia--from the doubtful hare to the still lively ruble. 
Russia to Belarus at the present time is something like Poland 
used to be to Russia, and Germany to Poland. On Sundays the 
Nevel market is highly reminiscent of a Polish or Hungarian 
market at the end of the 1980's. Remote Russian towns very 
quickly turned into border towns, which amazingly fast become 
saturated with the regular infrastructures: secret warehouses 
for contraband goods, intrepid people, guilds of conductors, 
guiding huge trailers via secret rural roads, drinking 
establishments, ramshackle hotels offering travelers saunas, 
Russian bath houses, and comely young ladies. Vladimir Agafonov, 
chief of the Nevel Customs Post talks about what the 
Russian-Belarus border looks like today. 
  [Agafonov] The Nevel Customs Post has existed since 1 
January 
1993. It was created on the basis of the Velikolukskiy Customs 
Post and includes a crossing point for motor vehicles along with 
two railway crossing points Nevel 1 and Nevel 2. 
  [Kozlov] How many people work at the customs post? 
  [Agafonov] There are 55 persons at the three crossing 
points. 
Most of the inspectors work directly at the motor vehicle 
crossing point--they conduct inspections of motor vehicles 
entering and exiting Russia. 
  [Kozlov] When will construction of the new customs complex 
be 
completed? 
  [Agafonov] Right now the motor vehicle crossing point 
represents, so to speak, a temporary facility. It is planned to 
introduce the new complex on 30 June. All of the services 
required for customs control will be deployed over an area of 
three-and-a-half hectares. Four lanes will be in operation--two 
for passenger vehicles, and two for trucks. 
  [Kozlov] Vladimir Nikolayevich, how was it possible to find 
55 customs officers at once in a remote Russian town such as 
Nevel? 
  [Agafonov] Actually, most of the inspectors live in Nevel. 
Mainly they are former officers and young people with a higher 
education. Many of them worked in production, but now the 
enterprises are being closed and the personnel are discharged. 
We send inspectors to St. Petersburg for special courses, after 
which they immediately go to work. Unemployment is growing in 
the country, therefore we are having no problems with personnel. 
I was recently the head of one of the enterprises. 
  [Kozlov] In other words, no one has years of working 
experience? 
  [Agafonov] Experience is acquired quite rapidly. It is 
possible to say that we are growing together with new Russian 
customs legislation. The main documents were adopted in May of 
last year. Our advantage over the old customs personnel is that 
we do not have to retrain. 
  [Kozlov] On average, how much does a customs inspector earn? 
  [Agafonov] Our wages are equated to wages in law enforcement 
organs. An inspector earns approximately as much as a sergeant 
in the militia--slightly less than 2,000. 
  [Kozlov] How would you describe the state of today's 
Russian- 
Belarus border? 
  [Agafonov] The border is quite transparent. There is no 
passport control. In our sector there are no frontier forces and 
none are planned. There are, however, 26 unmanned customs posts 
on alternate routes that could readily accommodate heavy 
transport. Even though we do have an agreement with the Belarus 
customs service--they return smugglers to Russia--it is, 
naturally, possible to catch far from all of them. 
  [Kozlov] Do assertions that Russia is being robbed and 
everything of any value at all is being exported, correspond to 
reality? Let us recall the latest film by Stanislav Govorukhin. 
  [Agafonov] To a certain degree they do, or rather did. In 
the 
first months of the customs post cargo, mainly raw material, was 
shipped out of Russia. This year the situation has changed. 
Shipments have been declining. Presently more is being imported 
into Russia than exported. In May the flow of freight decreased 
somewhat, but up to then 130-200 trucks were lined up daily 
waiting to enter Russia, and there was no exit line. 
  [Kozlov] What is being imported in Russia? 
  [Agafonov] Mainly foodstuffs, alcohol, and consumer goods. 
Less frequently, equipment. 
  [Kozlov] Each customs service has its history and 
traditions. 
What can the Nevel Post be proud of? 
  [Agafonov] When the flow was coming from Russia we detained 
up to seven freight shipments a day. We saved quite a lot of 
fuel, lumber, nonferrous metals, and fertilizer for the country. 
One shipment had 20 tonnes of copper, another one had 38 tonnes 
of nickel, while a third one contained seven tonnes of black 
caviar. 
  [Kozlov] Was that contraband? 
  [Agafonov] For the most part. Sometimes, however, the 
corresponding structures simply did not know how to complete the 
required documentation properly. 
  [Kozlov] What happens with the detained freight? 
  [Agafonov] It is stored in our guarded warehouses. Legal 
proceedings are initiated concerning the violation of customs 
rules and an appropriate decision is made. Frequently the matter 
is turned over to organs of the Internal Affairs Ministry or the 
procurator's office. Perishable goods are sold through the 
retail network of the Nevel Rayon, as soon as documents are 
prepared regarding the confiscation. 
  [Kozlov] What is the situation with narcotics and weapons? 
  [Agafonov] There have been some individual cases. 
  [Kozlov] Vladimir Nikolayevich, customs legislation changes 
so rapidly that people are simply unable to keep up with it. Do 
the existing rules infringe on the rights of normal citizens who 
are not smugglers? 
  [Agafonov] If one wants to export or import some goods 
within 
average limits, not at all. Personal effects with a value of up 
to 50 minimum wages and import $2,000 worth may be exported. 
Most goods may be imported into Belarus from Russia and into 
Russia from Belarus without any duties. Every citizen of Russia 
has the right to import one domestic motor vehicle from any CIS 
country once a year. There are restrictions on the export of 
gasoline--a full tank plus a 20-liter can. The Belarus side 
exercises rather strict control over the export of food from the 
republic. 
  [Kozlov] The establishment of a new country--the Republic of 
Belarus, took place virtually before your very eyes. How does 
the economic state of that country appear today out of the 
window of a Russian customs post? 
  [Agafonov] At first the tendency of Russians to export goods 
to Belarus was evident, since the economy there was functioning 
with greater success than in Russia. Sometime in October of last 
year the pendulum swung the other way--goods are being shipped 
from Belarus to Russia in order to acquire cash in rubles. 
  [Kozlov] What can be said about the Belarus currency--the 
hares? 
  [Agafonov] Absolutely no one wants them in Russia. Citizens 
of Russia exchange rubles for hares in order to purchase 
Belarusian goods, which are still somewhat cheaper than similar 
Russian goods but are of an inferior quality. On the whole that 
is done by people on both sides of the border who are not very 
prosperous. As far as I know, most of the residents of Belarus 
have a positive attitude toward the Russian ruble zone. 
  [Kozlov] Will there be any changes at the customs post after 
the final entry of Belarus in the ruble zone? 
  [Agafonov] I do not think so. Of all the freight shipped 
through the post that from Belarus amounts to barely more than 
10 percent. There may be some changes in duties, but customs 
control will continue as it has been. 
  [Kozlov] How are relations with your Belarusian colleagues 
shaping up? 
  [Agafonov] We have excellent relations. We are in contact 
almost daily. I frequently meet with customs personnel from 
other CIS countries. Everyone favors cooperation and restoration 
of ties. We are also for that. But without harm to Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Igrunov, deputy chairman of the State </F>
Duma Committee on CIS Affairs and Relations with 
Fellow-Countrymen: "Come Out of Egypt As We Are"] 
  [Text] My first reaction to the publication of Zatulin's 
interview was the desire to immediately write a rebuke and raise 
in the Duma the question of dismissing K.F. from the position of 
chairman of the Committee on CIS Affairs and Relations with 
Fellow-Countrymen. A phone call from Sochi arrived just in time, 
however, promising to give a refutation, time dragged on, and 
... it seems, I am now forced to dispute the viewpoint, not of 
Zatulin, but of his interviewer. 
  No, it is not that I changed my attitude toward Konstantin 
Fedorovich's views -- I considered, and still consider them to 
be ruinous and tremendously damaging for Russia. It is not that 
I doubted the authenticity of the interview -- in private 
conversations the "well-known politician" had uttered the 
precise words that were conveyed on the pages of NG, even those 
which were not confirmed by tape recording. The point is that in 
I. Rotar's article, "Rossiyskiy neoimperializm" [Russian 
Neoimperialism], I detected depressing cliches and a distressing 
superficiality, born, perhaps, in the heat of polemics and 
excusable for a current-affairs commentator, but bitter in the 
texts of such a thoughtful researcher and ethnic-political 
scientist as Igor Rotar. 
  First of all, I should like to touch on a few 
generalizations. 
  It is extremely hasty to identify Mr. Zatulin's revelations 
with "the position of official Moscow" and even of the PRES 
Party. Zatulin does not even express the position of the State 
Duma, which can be seen from the votes on its proposals. The 
fact that he is the chairman of the committee reflects, 
unfortunately, not the Duma's orientation in Commonwealth 
affairs, but the merely formal assignment of duties in the 
parliament, which was approved as a package. The striking 
divergence between Zatulin's authority and the status that he 
has acquired once again emphasizes the depravity, under our 
conditions, of the method of impersonal allocation of seats to 
appease the powerful extremist wings in parliament. 
  Igor Rotar's "high-ranking collocutor" obtained his post 
because, in the allocation of seats, the position of chairman of 
the Committee on CIS Affairs fell to the lot of PRES, and not 
because his program most adequately reflected the mood in the 
Duma. In turn, Mr. Shakhray offered this post to Konstantin 
Fedorovich, not because the latter has great prestige in the 
faction or reflects the point of view of its leader, but because 
it was necessary to settle accounts fittingly according to 
pre-election obligations. I assure you, Mr. Rotar, the faction 
and Sergey Shakhray are scarcely delighted about this. 
  Of course, the very fact of Zatulin's presence in such an 
important seat attests to the level of responsibility of the 
Duma and certain specific leaders and political factions, but 
this is nothing more than a politically conscious position on 
cooperation within the framework of the Commonwealth (or 
imperial politics, if you like). 
  Whatever the Duma's position was, however, today it plays a 
negligible role in the real foreign policy of the state. More 
important here, for example, is the position of the MID 
[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]. Here the author of the article 
"Rossiyskiy neorealizm" [Russian Neo-Realism] alludes to the 
pronouncements of Vadim Kuznetsov on the "constructive relations 
that have been formed" with Zatulin. It was perceived as a 
sensation, however. This attests only to the fact that in his 
official utterances, Mr. Zatulin behaves with much greater 
restraint, and in general, much more judiciously. Being not so 
much Mr. Zatulin's opponent as his antagonist, I am often forced 
to express my solidarity with his position, not because I am 
myself an imperialist, but because Zatulin knows how to take 
into consideration in his speeches the opinion of other members 
of the Committee and the atmosphere of the encounters and moods 
of the collocutor. All this is done in a very talented way, so 
that many of those who were shocked by Zatulin's revelations 
were sometimes delighted by his speeches. Nothing is so natural 
to people as the ability to be easily deceived. Zatulin's 
successful "diplomacy," therefore, must not be identified with 
the position of the MID or even of Mr. Kuznetsov. 
  Let us put aside the perpetrator of the scandal, however, 
because he provides only the grounds for I. Rotar: the article 
contains an interesting analysis of Russian politics. The 
accusations here are better-founded and more serious. 
  Not only the author of the article, but also a tremendous 
number of political scientists and journalists are now pumping 
out the myth of a new Russian imperialism. Not that there are no 
grounds for it: the Soviet people form a policy with Soviet 
mentality, poisoned, moreover, with industrialized nationalism. 
This tendency to decide how best to "build up" Russia or the new 
abroad from Moscow will remain for a long time yet (and 
institutional and ideological counterbalances to this will have 
to be worked out), because nothing is so conservative as human 
culture and psychology. Is this, however, a basis for declaring 
any integrationalist movement imperialist? 
  Cultural expanses and economic associations, just as other 
self-organized systems, have mechanisms of the homeostasis of 
self-renewal. These mechanisms are a powerful force in history. 
In the middle of the first millennium, the Persians created a 
world empire which existed for three centuries. This was enough 
so that two centuries after that the unified space was 
reintegrated time after time within approximately the same 
limits. Just as many characteristic integration features are 
perceptible in the history of Europe, beginning with the days of 
the Roman Empire. What is more, Russia inherited the tremendous 
integration potential of the Mongolian Empire. Not all 
integration or reintegration, however, follows the course of an 
empire (we will not discuss the imperial legacy itself in such a 
short piece of material). For example, the integration of modern 
Europe is completely non-imperial in nature. The creators of 
anti-Russian rhetoric relate the unification of the monetary 
systems of Russia and Belorussia [Belarus] as evidence of a 
neoimperialist policy, even though it is obvious that here the 
initiative does not at all stem from an imperialist center. This 
does not mean, by the way, that we are guaranteed against the 
restoration of vassal relationships, but this possibility does 
not stem directly from Russia's readiness to go halfway to meet 
Belorussia, Armenia or Tajikistan. In order to avoid the 
restoration of an empire, we must show what is unjustified in 
the integration mechanisms and suggest alternatives, not fight 
against integration itself as a potential for the Fall. 
  Critics of neoimperialism, however, do not as a rule go 
beyond the limits of the label. This can also be seen in the use 
of terms such as "former metropolitan state." Can one speak of 
Russia this way? If there was a metropolitan state in the USSR, 
it was by no means Russia, but rather, Moscow within the limits 
of the MKAD [Moscow Ring Road]. A Ukrainian resident enjoyed no 
fewer rights in the metropolitan state than did a resident of 
Saratov or Nezhniy Tagil. In general, the USSR was an organism 
organized in a very complicated way, in which citizens were 
divided into a multitude of types according to a whole set of 
criteria, and the striving to convert the Russians en masse into 
an "imperial nation," Russia into a metropolitan state, and the 
14 other republics into a colony is therefore no more than an 
ideological cliche. Fit, alas, only for destruction. 
  Thus, I insist that, it is by no means only the motive of 
bringing back imperial grandeur that is present in the striving 
toward reintegration, but also the natural motive of ensuring 
economic prosperity, observance of human rights, cultural 
self-realization, etc., etc. This striving does not just come 
from Russia and not just from the Russians. Not being foisted on 
us from without, and being voluntary, this striving is building 
a new, integrated world, which will inevitably retain the 
features of the old centralized state, with its imperial 
mentality for some time, but will not be blanketed by them. The 
alternative to this "stained" shadow of past integration, 
however, will be only disintegration and degradation, which can 
be alleviated in some cases, but cannot be overcome. 
Decivilization, which has already assumed unprecedented rates in 
the expanses of the Soviet Union, is the only real alternative 
to integration. But did not those who strove to destroy the USSR 
really do this out of a striving to ensure human rights? A 
worthy emergence into world civilization? (I am not speaking of 
those who used anti-Sovietism as an instrument of struggle with 
Russia -- any Russia, totalitarian or democratic). 
  If these aspirations are sincere, however, just how can one 
indict Russia for its concern with the rights of the Russian 
people in the new near abroad? This is its duty, which is 
inscribed in the obligations of all civilized peoples to ensure 
adherence to human rights, regardless of race, religion or 
nationality. Why should concern for the rights of the Estonians 
(expressed in granting independence to Estonia) run counter to 
concern for the rights of the Russians (expressed in the 
striving to acquire citizenship in our own native land)? And why 
does the use of economic levers seem, a priori, terrible? Were 
economic sanctions not applied against the USSR, which had 
violated human rights? Or against Serbia? Or against the UAR? 
The liberals, who almost go into a coma at the mention of 
Russian economic sanctions, supported and are supporting 
sanctions of another type. Why such a double-faced moral? Other 
things aside, economic levers can be not only negative, but also 
positive. Both constitute the customary practice of democratic 
states. It is therefore superficial to reject a certain specific 
instrument without considering the specific forms of its 
application. Otherwise, we will be dealing, not with politics, 
but with hysterics. 
  The possibility of retaining military bases in Tajikistan, 
Georgia or Moldova inspires us with horror. What will happen, 
though, if there is no other way to ensure stability and safety? 
I am not talking about thrusting our bases on them forcibly, but 
is military intervention in the Tajikistan of which I. Rotar 
writes, really more forcible in nature than in Somalia? Bosnia? 
Etc., etc. 
  As for what certain politicians say, they are using the same 
old cliches, which correspond fully to their troglodytic 
mentality. Alas, our country has no other politicians or other 
people, and we should come out of Egypt as we are, in order to 
step on the soil of Jericho just 40 years later, and if we do 
not want our Jericho to be a repetition of our Egypt, we must 
not reject the path through the desert but, stubbornly going 
toward our goal, should cast our riches upon the fire every day.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Yusin: "Moscow and Tallinn Seek Measures To </F>
Influence Each Other"] 
  [Text] Russia probably has not had such strained 
relations developing with any other republic of the former USSR 
as with Estonia. The brief visit by Andrey Kozyrev to Tallinn 
confirmed that there is still very far to go to a true 
partnership and good neighborliness. 
  "Kozyrev = Goebbels"--this sign in the hands of an Estonian 
girl greeted the Russian minister in Tallinn. Kozyrev, however, 
did not leave that unanswered. "We shall not withdraw troops 
from Estonia until questions connected with military pensioners 
are settled," he declared at Vnukovo Airport a few minutes 
before departing for the Estonian capital. While the next day, 
appearing before Russian- speaking residents of Tallinn, the 
head of Russian diplomacy was even more frank: "We shall apply 
every measure of economic, political, and sociological pressure 
so that Estonian authorities will observe the rights of national 
minorities." 
  Russian-Estonian relations are clouded by three main 
problems. First of all by the presence of Russian troops, the 
withdrawal of which Tallinn has been demanding without success 
for some three years. Today Estonia remains the only Baltic 
country that has not settled that issue with Russia. In 
Lithuania, as commonly known, there are no more Russian 
soldiers, while they will be withdrawn from Latvia by 31 August 
1994, in accordance with the recently signed agreements. Russian 
military presence in Estonia is not all that significant--there 
are around 2,000 soldiers and officers in the republic. It would 
seem there should be no serious difficulties with their 
withdrawal, all the more since as long ago as last year Russia 
promised to complete the evacuation of troops by the fall of 
1994. 
  The situation, however, underwent a change. The flare-up of 
nationalist moods in Russia could not help but be reflected in 
the attitude toward Baltic countries. Among the Russian 
political elite it became fashionable to prove one's patriotism 
with hard-line declarations directed at Latvia and Estonia. The 
authorities of these two republics in turn promoted the 
aggravation of relations with the Kremlin by passing a series of 
laws which Moscow viewed as discriminatory toward the 
Russian-speaking population. The result was quick in 
coming--Russia withdrew its promise to move out the troops by 31 
August. 
  That step certainly did not improve our reputation in the 
world. Western leaders did not conceal their negative attitude 
toward preservation of the military presence of Moscow on the 
territory of sovereign states contrary to the will of their 
governments. Judging by everything, Russian authorities 
themselves felt uncomfortable: having "intimidated" Latvia and 
Estonia, they simultaneously initiated negotiations with them, 
letting it be understood that in exchange for certain 
concessions they were prepared to withdraw their forces by the 
deadline. 
  With Latvia that tactic worked, but the Estonians displayed 
much more stubbornness, and primarily, with regard to the 
question concerning the status of military pensioners. Moscow 
demands that these people (of whom there are 10,500 in the 
republic, and with family members--over 40,000) be given 
residence permits. Tallinn refuses to do that, considering that 
the retired military constitute a threat to state security. 
  The Kremlin took a rigid position--if the Estonians do not 
comply with Russian demands, the troops will not be withdrawn by 
31 August. At the same they understand both in Moscow and in 
Tallinn that this is no more than a delay, sooner or later the 
troops will leave anyway. Otherwise it will be difficult to 
understand the behavior of Russia other than as an 
occupier--with all of the resulting consequences to relations 
between Moscow and the West. It is hardly likely that President 
Yeltsin will go for that. It is more likely that those measures 
of political and economic pressure, which were mentioned by 
Kozyrev, will be applied against Tallinn. It is not precluded 
that with time Moscow will decide to introduce sanctions, even 
though at the present time members of the Russian delegation 
insisted that this question is not being considered. 
  As far as political pressure is concerned, there is no 
denying that the Russian minister of foreign affairs is 
persistent. Over the past several months there has not been a 
single European forum at which he did not raise the issue of 
discrimination against Russians in Estonia. The Tallinn Baltic 
countries foreign ministers' conference was no exception. 
Initially Kozyrev had no plans to travel to the Estonian 
capital. The doubts disappeared after Moscow received assurances 
that the Baltic Council will establish the post of a special 
commissioner for human rights, following the example of the 
CSCE. Kozyrev decided to abandon his boycott of the conference 
and express his attitude toward the policy of Estonian 
authorities in another way. The conference had barely opened 
when the Russian minister delivered a surprise, making public a 
letter recently received by the Russian Embassy. The war 
veterans complained about Estonian bureaucracy requiring 
countless certificates in order to obtain a residence permit, 
including results of tests for AIDS and syphilis (which Kozyrev 
emphasized in particular). 
  A third painful problem in Russian-Estonian 
relations--territorial claims of Tallinn against Moscow, also 
surfaced in the course of the visit. Estonians are demanding the 
return of lands seized by Stalin shortly after Soviet 
occupation. Russia refuses even to discuss that matter. Estonian 
claims produce ill concealed irritation in Moscow, and in most 
of the European capitals--skeptical smiles. 
  At the final press conference a squabble developed between 
Kozyrev and his Estonian colleague Juri Luik. Luik stated that 
he will be raising the territorial issue at the Paris conference 
on stability in Europe, where both ministers were to fly 
directly after the Baltic conference. Kozyrev promised that in 
France that issue will not even be studied. "As you see, I have 
kept my word," the Russian minister declared with satisfaction, 
two days after the Paris forum ended. "Not a word was said about 
the territorial claims of Estonia." 
  Russian diplomats pin their main hope for overcoming the 
crisis in bilateral relations on Estonian President Lennart 
Meri. Recently he has spoken from very moderate positions, 
thereby invoking the anger of supporters of a rigid policy. 
Negotiations between Kozyrev and Meri continued for two hours 
instead of the scheduled 30 minutes. It was decided to renew 
negotiations discontinued in April in the immediate future. On 
Smolensk Square they are hoping that Tallinn will still agree to 
a compromise on the issue of pensioners. An impression is 
forming that Meri is gravitating toward the same decision, 
however, he will find it difficult to overcome the opposition of 
Luik and that of Prime Minister Mart Laar who hold a more 
radical view. 
  "Let us look truth in the eye. The world does not understand 
our concern about the military pensioners. We must realize that, 
no matter what, we will not be able to get rid of most of the 
Russian retired officers," Toivo Klaar, director of the 
Political Department of the Estonian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, declared. His article was published on the day of 
Kozyrev's arrival. According to Klaar, Estonia has no intention 
of deporting "70-year-old war veterans." Questions arise in 
connection with the 35-40-year old KGB and GRU officers who 
retired following the August putsch. In the view of Estonian 
authorities, it is specifically these people who pose the 
principal threat to the security of the nation. Up to now, 
however, Russia is not agreeing to the separation of pensioners 
into those who are seventy and those who are younger. It is 
possible to assume that at the forthcoming negotiations this 
issue will become a stumbling block and Moscow, despite 
everything, will have to take into account the concern of 
Estonians and manifest some flexibility.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "A Concept of Post-Check Privatization </F>
has Been Developed by the Russian Federation Government Taking 
the Present Stage of Socio-Economic Reforms Into Account"] 
  [Text] 
<H8>  Goals </H8>
  1. An increase in the economy's efficiency. 
  2. Assistance to the processes of forming strategic 
owners as the foundations of market relationships. 
  3. Involvement in the privatization process of new 
facilities 
which have not previously participated in privatization. 
  4. Utilization of a portion of the funds received from 
privatization for the purposes of social protection. 5. 
Replenishment of budget revenues and reduction of the 
expenditures of enterprises benefiting from state support. 
<H8>  Basic Approaches </H8>
  1. Maximum orientation on increasing the efficiency of 
economic activity. The following are to utilized for this: 
  the specially organized sale of previously not 
sold and consolidated in state (municipal) ownership 
blocks of shares through investment competitions; at 
the same time, the proceeds from the sale are to be directed to 
these enterprises for investment purposes or in the form of 
subventions for the replenishment of working capital; 
  the preferential sale of enterprises subject to 
privatization to strategic investors (principally by blocks 
of shares constituting more than 51 percent) at auction or on 
the basis of the investment rate of exchange; 
  the sale of no less than 30 percent of the shares of any 
joint-stock company for money to small investors; 
  various forms of post-privatization support of 
enterprises (help in reconstruction, secondary issue of 
shares, etc.). 
  2. The appraisal of the property of enterprises being 
privatized after 1 July 1994 according to standard procedure 
based on book value but taking into account the one-time 
revaluation in conformity with government decree No. 595 of 
14 August 1992. 
  3. Concentration of most of the proceeds from the 
sale of shares at the local or regional level in the 
case of the assumption by the pertinent organs of state 
administration and of local government of obligations regarding 
the maintenance of social-cultural and municipal and everyday 
services purpose facilities. 
  4. Expansion of the rights of regional property funds with 
respect to: 
  the choice of the method of sale of shares; 
  the replacement in privatization plans of the methods of 
privatization, including auction or investment competition, by 
specialized monetary auction and vice versa; 
  replacement of the transfer of shares in trust and their 
sales on the basis of an investment competition or at a 
specialized monetary auction. 
  5. Expansion of the list of facilities mandatory for 
privatization through the inclusion in it of real estate, 
land parcels occupied by enterprises being 
privatized, mass information media and the printing 
industry complex. 
  6. The mandatory sale of the property of insolvent 
debtor enterprises at the request of creditors to 
accelerate the solution of the problem of non-payments in the 
national economy. 
  7. Support of the reconstruction of privatized 
enterprises through state funds and the funds of the 
countries of the "seven" only on condition that the following 
requirements are fulfilled: 
  the availability in private ownership of more than 
90 percent of the shares of the enterprises; 
  the fulfillment of the requirements of corporative 
management; 
  the absence of restrictions on the buying and 
selling of the shares of a given enterprise; 
  the presence of an independent registrar who keeps the 
roll of the shareholders of a given company. 
  8. Expansion of the list of methods of 
privatization being utilized, including through the 
inclusion in them of: 
  a co-founder competition; 
  the leasing of property prohibited from privatization; 
  a specialized money auction; 
  the development of special schemes for the 
privatization of super-large enterprises (with a 
charter capital of 10 billion rubles in prices of 1 January 
1992). 
  9. A different approach to the privatization of those 
enterprises which have accomplished check privatization and of 
those which for various reasons did not participate in it. 
  10. Exemption from taxes of operations regarding 
the buying and selling of the shares of privatized enterprises. 
  11. Improvement of the privatization of military 
property by means of: 
  decentralization of the privatization process; 
  the mandatory transfer of a portion of the proceeds to 
the immediate seller (no less than 30 percent); 
  the creation of organs which monitor the 
privatization process from among the members of officer 
assemblies; 
  the transfer on lease or the sale of military 
property (unutilized premises and technical equipment as 
well as repair enterprises) with the direction of all proceeds 
by the fund holder to housing construction and the social 
protection of the servicemen of the appropriate military 
units; 
  the transfer of the stores of Voyentorg (Military Trading 
Organization) on a competition basis to cooperatives and private 
enterprises created by officers of the reserve; 
  the transfer of facilities of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Defense situated outside the Russian Federation on 
lease to enterprises created by officer partnerships 
(tovarishchestvo). 
  12. The use of part of the proceeds from privatization for 
the purpose of the social protection of the population. 
  13. The substantial reduction of the privileges for the 
labor collectives and managers of state enterprises. 
  In other respects the continuity of the privatization 
programs of 1992-1993 is to be preserved, including with respect 
to the lists of facilities having restrictions on privatization, 
etc.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Court Overturns Warning by Mr. </F>
Shumeyko to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA"] 
  [Text] On 19 April 1994 the Tver Inter-Municipal (formerly 
Sverdlovsk) People's Court in the City of Moscow (Judge 
Baburina) tried a case stemming from a lawsuit brought by 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA against the Russian Federation Press 
Committee, asking that the warning issued by the former Ministry 
of the Press be declared illegal. The court found in favor of 
the plaintiff in this lawsuit. 
  The essence of this case lay in the fact that on 2 December 
1993 the Russian Federation Ministry of the Press and 
Information sent an official warning--signed by V.F. 
Shumeyko--to the editors of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. This warning 
asserted that, by publishing in the 30 November 1993 issue a 
draft edict by the president of the Russian Federation on the 
administrative-territorial unification of the city of Moscow and 
Moscow Oblast, the editors had "used the mass media for the 
purpose of committing a criminally punishable act," and that 
"the information is false inasmuch as no such draft exists." 
  The warning was incorrect both in substance (the draft edict 
did exist) and in form; the reference to Section 59, Part 2 and 
Section 51 of the Russian Federation Law on the Mass Media had 
no legal force inasmuch as these sections do not provide for 
intervention by a ministry in the form of a warning. Nor did 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA violate Section 4 of the Russian Federation 
Law on the Mass Media, i.e., it did not "use the mass media for 
the purpose of committing a criminally punishable act." 
  The court agreed with the plaintiff's arguments. The 
decision 
recognizing the illegality of the warning issued by the Ministry 
of the Press took effect on 1 May 1994. The Press Committee did 
not appeal it. 
  Attorney Raisa Tyurina defended NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's 
interests in this case.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Improvisations by the President's </F>
Press Secretary"] 
  [Text] At a briefing held yesterday at the Kremlin, 
Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president of the Russian Federation's 
press secretary, remarked that--as a result of the publication 
by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of an item concerning the imminent 
resignation of Sergey Filatov, administrative chief of the 
president of the Russian Federation--an "impression has been 
created that NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA lacks genuine sources of 
information and is, therefore, engaging in improvisation. 
"Filatov was, is, and will remain in a test period as one of the 
president's closest staff associates, and there can be no talk 
of his resignation," said Mr. Kostikov, as reported by the 
POSTFACTUM news agency. Let us merely note that the information 
concerning Filatov's resignation as a matter which has already 
been decided was reported to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA by persons 
whose names we do not wish to publish. But allow us to assure 
our readers and the president's press secretary himself that--by 
their rank within the presidential hierarchy--they are higher 
than Mr. Kostikov and, therefore, better informed than he is.

<F P=106> [Article by N. Davydov: "A Correction of Strategy"] </F>
  [Text] Under the conditions of the continuing slump 
in transport volume and the deteriorating economic situation in 
the sector, the railroad workers have increasingly been forced 
to introduce corrections in the strategy of their activity. Not 
five months have passed since the Program for the Development of 
Reforms and Strengthening of the Financial-Economic Position of 
Transport in 1994-1995 was adopted in December of last year, and 
here the collegium held last week expanded anew the course 
taken, and interpreted the situation that has formed in a 
somewhat new way. 
  As B.M. Lapidus, chief of the Economics and Development 
Administration, reported, representatives of all the railroads 
and ministry administrations took part in amending the program. 
In particular, the earlier accepted guidelines for releasing 
workers employed in transport, shutting down low-activity 
stations and sections, taking locomotives and rail cars out of 
service, expanding the testing ground for the use of old 
materials for the permanent roadway, and so on, were revised. 
All this will make it possible to save over 240 billion rubles 
[R] in operating expenses. 
  Ways of increasing revenues were accordingly outlined. 
Thanks 
to additionally adopted measures, they can be increased to R325 
billion. Well, the next few months will show whether this will 
be enough to improve the financial situation of the roads and 
sector as a whole. 
  V.F. Zayko, first deputy chief of the West Siberian 
mainline, 
presented to those assembled the road program for a change in 
this line's structure. He emphasized that it would be simply 
impossible to work unless administrative expenditures were 
further cut. It was therefore decided to keep three divisions, 
instead of the five present ones. The Barabinsk will be 
completely merged into the Novosibirsk, and the Karasuk--by 
sections, into the Altay and Omsk. 
  I will not retell in detail the technical side of the 
problem 
set forth by Zayko, particularly since it is similar to 
corresponding measures on the October Railroad, on which GUDOK 
has already given quite a detailed report. It is much more 
important, perhaps, to dwell on the social consequences of this 
step. The speaker assured us that each of the 512 administrative 
workers released will be found jobs on the railroad, and 
moreover without changing their place of residence. 
  But here G.M. Fadeyev, minister of railways and the head of 
the collegium, began to read a letter that had arrived, 
addressed to him, from transport veterans of Karasuk, in which 
the actions of the railroad Commission for Eliminating Divisions 
were judged to be destructive and ruinous measures. They said 
that this number of administrative workers could have been 
released without breaking up the road structure. The letter 
ended with the words: 
  "We beg you to take into consideration our pain and alarm 
when solving the problem at the collegium." 
  "How can this be," the minister addressed the speaker, "you 
state that the work collectives and trade unions approved your 
actions, but after that, a letter like this arrives?" 
  "One can understand the veterans," answered Zayko. "The 
Karasuk Division always occupied the central place on the 
Central Siberian Railroad, and by all indicators was one of the 
leading divisions on the road. Now, however, the daily load 
volume here is not over 40 rail cars, and on the Barabinsk 
division even less--27. Both divisions are constantly subsidized 
by the three remaining ones. This means that this is an enforced 
measure, and we feel that there is no alternative." 
  None of the collegium members who spoke on this subject 
attempted to refute these conclusions. On the contrary. The idea 
was conveyed that consolidating the divisions was exactly what 
was needed to preserve the social milieu and protect the people, 
or else it could not survive under market conditions. With 
transit cut in half and a slump in passenger turnover, both 
divisions were becoming obvious candidates for bankruptcy. 
Apparently, though, the situation that has formed has not been 
convincingly enough explained to everyone, which gives rise to 
letters like this. 
  The collegium passed a resolution to agree with the proposal 
of the West Siberian Railroad management that the divisions be 
consolidated. The problems of finding jobs for the people are 
not out of control, however. 
  The main item this day was the problem of developing a 
transport-dispatch service for freight owners and improving the 
use of the container fleet. This problem was also posed back at 
the December collegium and stems from the need for better 
adaptation to work under market conditions, when freight owners 
become more demanding and competition from motor vehicle and 
other forms of transport increases. 
  The reports by V.M. Logunov, chief of the Freight and 
Commercial Work Administration, and V.M. Bogdanov, deputy 
director of VNIIZhT [All-Union Railroad Transport Scientific 
Research Institute], gave a detailed analysis of the reasons for 
the development of a transport-dispatch service being slowed 
down. Both positive and negative factors in this sphere of 
activity were mentioned. The good work experience of the Moscow 
Railroad was especially noted, in particular that of the Moscow 
Junction, which had done away with the Mosavtotrans 
monopoly--the container areas that formerly belonged to it were 
returned to the road's keeping, the necessary motor vehicle 
transport has been acquired, and now practically all the 
mechanized subdivisions for loading-unloading work are engaged 
in performing transport-dispatch operations. It is expected that 
over R2 billion in additional revenues will be obtained this 
year through this. 
  Other positive examples were also presented, including some 
by the directors, speaking at the collegium, of line 
enterprises, which are trying to expand the framework of the 
transport-dispatch service for enterprises and the people. V.A. 
Bakunin, chief of the Vologda Board of Directors for 
Loading-Unloading Work and Commercial operations, and L.K. 
Bezmenov, chief of the Magnitogorsk Municipal Freight Station, 
told of their achievements and problems. Efficient seeds are 
sprouting on the North Caucasus, Gorkiy, Kuybyshev, and South 
Urals railroads.... 
  By the end of each speech, however, the cheerful pictures 
were replaced by quite a cheerless one, and it was almost 
unanimously verified: Despite the efforts made, a lot of private 
and semiprivate offices have propagated around the railroad, and 
they are taking on the delivery of freight wherever they like, 
even though they have neither locomotives nor rail cars nor 
containers, nor, of course, railroad tracks. Five such 
advertisements were found in a single issue of the newspaper IZ 
RUK V RUKI! After reading these out, the minister turned to the 
two speakers and all those attending with the questions: Why do 
you regard them as competitors, on what basis? Or are the 
station chiefs offering them everything they need as a bribe? In 
the end, what will prevent us from creating our own flexible 
system for a transport-dispatch service? 
  Unfortunately, after this, most of the speeches were 
self-reports. True, someone alluded to the fact that the status 
and charter of the mechanized loading-unloading subdivisions 
were obsolete and were not being incorporated in the new work 
conditions. Someone else drew the conclusion that a transition 
to large containers must be made. The next one--we are losing a 
great deal because of the fact that freight insurance has been 
put in the hands of ZhASO [expansion not given]. And so on. 
  Few people, however, remembered the main thing, the reason 
for which, strictly speaking, the collegium was assembled, and 
which was designated as the priority strategic task as far back 
as December--creating a through system of freight dispatch for 
the entire network, including the near abroad. Those preparing 
this problem for discussion at the collegium probably did not 
have a sufficiently systemic approach to its solution. After 
all, there is useful experience at the line enterprises and 
stations, and here and there they have begun to turn and face 
the inquiries of the customers on the divisions and in the road 
administrations. The Transzheldorekspeditsiya state enterprise 
has appeared under the aegis of the ministry. On the whole, 
though, the system is not working. Why? 
  Attempts have been made, including in the speeches, to 
answer 
this question. Mention was made of the need for a market 
approach to the matter, the growing demand for creating dispatch 
organizations, contractual tariffs, the task office, and the 
speed of freight delivery. There were quite a few different 
ideas on the way in which large containers could be used more 
efficiently. 
  All the same, closest of all to the truth, in my opinion, 
were those who gave a sober evaluation of the situation in the 
country, which has changed so radically. A simple example. 
Twenty years ago, it was no problem to transport household goods 
by rail. Now this is almost an insoluble problem. The main thing 
at that time was not the need to look for customers and attract 
freight to the railroad: Industry and agriculture worked 
smoothly, and the roads constantly had to seek reserves of 
rolling stock and throughput potentials. 
  Today, however, the boundlessness of prices and tariffs is 
forcing the railroad workers to revise the guidelines and 
emphases of their activity. The main thing now is no longer to 
transport, but to find freight, and the leading occupation is 
therefore, most likely, not that of engineer but of freight 
dispatcher. 
  So far, however, we have no such person, in the market sense 
of this figure. However you twist things, whatever explanation 
you think up, things cannot be put right without this figure, 
especially since there is also no information support for this 
new system we are trying to set up. Even though, as A.Ya. 
Sidenko, deputy minister, expressed it, our equipment permits us 
to learn in a matter of seconds, for example, the location of a 
rail car that went from Murmansk to Nakhodka a week ago. 
  All right, once again you have to make sure: Any new model 
or 
system should have economic substantiation. This gap is to be 
filled by a commission created at the collegium, which should 
bring to a logical conclusion the preparation of the structure, 
sphere of influence, technical equipment, and clearing accounts 
mechanism of the future transport-dispatch system. 
  It can be said without exaggeration that even the 
recertification of the managerial staff of the Northern Railroad 
went along on the basis of the new criteria. Essentially, the 
work of the entire collective of the mainline was evaluated 
under the most difficult economic conditions. The talk was 
specific, based on principle and with an emphasis on the 
existing shortcomings. First and foremost, there was an analysis 
of the situation with wages and the potentials for reducing 
debts. This collation of the course in the work of the collegium 
and the road leaders can probably be of mutual assistance. 
  In connection with the approaching 20th anniversary of the 
start of BAM construction, the collegium discussed the proposals 
of the mainline construction veterans, the military builders, 
and a number of public organizations that a series of measures 
be prepared for carrying out in July-August. This includes the 
slated applied science conference, "BAM: Yesterday, Today, and 
Tomorrow." It is proposed that a trip be organized on BAM for a 
large group of journalists from the capital, in order to show, 
through the mass information media, the unutilized possibilities 
concealed on this route, and the way people are now living and 
working there, and at the same time to give a graphic 
demonstration to the journalists of the problems of the "steel 
mainlines." 
  The Russian and Moscow journalistic organizations supported 
this idea. In this way, attention can be drawn to BAM's 
problems, in particular, to the uncompleted facilities, most 
important of which is the Severomuyskiy Tunnel. The collegium 
entrusted A.O. Bogdanovich, deputy minister, with all the 
problems involved in organizing these measures. 
  K.P. Ayrapetov, chief of the Business Affairs 
Administration, 
reported to the collegium participants on the state of executive 
discipline on the ministry staff. The main idea of his speech 
amounted to the fact that preparation of the documents, 
particularly those outside the boundaries of the Ministry of 
Railways, can be accelerated through reducing the number of 
executors. He said that there should be one person responsible 
for coordinating the content in all the administrations involved 
in this matter.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Rustam Narzikulov: "President Provokes a </F>
Reformist Rush"] 
  [Text] It is pure cunning--to equate the significance of 
five decrees hastily signed by the president with that of the 
January reform of 1992; we should not, however, blame Aleksandr 
Livshits for this trick, since it is his job to substantiate his 
boss' grand- sounding political statements. 
  In reality, only Edict No. 1007, "On Repealing Quotas and 
Licenses on Exports of Goods and Services" (the shortest of them 
all--only half a page), may lay claim to being called radical, 
since it essentially removes the last direct administrative 
restrictions on the movement of Russian goods--this time in the 
sphere of international trade. 
  The edict becomes effective on 1 July, which means that, 
beginning in the second half of 1994, all the goodness the 
bureaucrats derived from granting quotas, licenses, and 
preferences in custom duty taxation is out; naturally, the 
beneficiaries will be the Ministry of Finance and the budget, 
whose revenue part until now has been in inverse proportion to 
the go-getting power of exporters and regional administrations. 
  Liberalization of foreign trade should bring about the end 
of 
the omnipotent "nontariff regulation," and the volume of exports 
of goods and services will depend on the commercial 
effectiveness of the exports and the size of export duty, which, 
in turn, increases the role of the customs. 
  It is unlikely that we will see a violent reaction of the 
world markets on liberalization of Russian exports. Some of them 
(aluminum and uranium) already are protected from an 
unpredictable increase in Russian exports by corresponding 
agreements, and Edict No. 1007 reaffirms obligations in this 
respect. As to other raw material exports (first and foremost, 
oil), it is impossible to increase their exports overnight 
because of transport limitations. 
  The "anti-theft" Decree on the Reform of State Enterprises 
is 
more of a declaration of the state's intent to control the 
utilization of property that belongs to it, but certainly not an 
immediate introduction of the institution of treasury-owned 
property. By the way, the draft document was prepared a long 
time ago and had not been signed--not the least because of 
resistance by Anatoliy Chubays, who apparently detected that 
treasury-owned economic entities represent a method of reforming 
state property as an alternative to privatization. 
  As to the remaining three financial-monetary edicts, there 
is 
nothing "reformist" in them, since the subject is a routine 
change in tax rates, combating tax evasion, and improvements in 
money clearing. Such documents, which clearly are below the 
status of presidential decrees, have been, are, and will be 
issued every time the government (the Ministry of Finance or the 
Central Bank) makes a decision to change tax parameters or the 
mechanism for legal entities to settle accounts with the budget 
and among themselves. 
  These documents will get into the orbit of Yeltsin and his 
administration's attention only in the event the president once 
again "discovers" economic problems that are well-known to the 
majority of the population. The utility of periodic splashes of 
the head of the state's interest in the economy is 
unquestionable--the needed documents are signed without delay 
and get the highest status. Compared to this, the costs in the 
form of canceled official visits (this time, Aleksandr Shokhin's 
to Seoul) and additional apparat hustle seem minimal.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikita Kirichenko and Yelena Makovskaya: "The </F>
Central Bank Does Not Want To Be Overseen"] 
  [Text] Early last week the State Duma held hearings 
on the draft of the new law on the Central Bank. Because the 
hearings were organized in violation of the working rules of the 
Duma they should be considered unofficial, a kind of exhibition 
match. However, the careful selection of the audience and the 
fact that the extracurricular debate received unusually 
extensive treatment in the mass information media gives our 
KOMMERSANT experts reason to think that this was a match that 
"counted." 
  Most likely the observers were witnesses to the first 
(in the new political realities) round of the struggle between 
two committees, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank 
itself, for the part of "concertmaster" in determining the 
directions of credit-monetary policy. In our view, the fact that 
the group of bankers who have an interest in this was sparsely 
represented indicates that the discussion was primarily an 
"internecine" political squabble. 
  Boris Fedorov, the chairman of the Duma subcommittee on 
credit-finance policy and the Central Bank, submitted his bill 
for discussion by those assembled. In concept it would replace 
the Central Bank charter with a direct law. Of course, it 
quickly became clear that in the State Duma committee on the 
budget, taxes, banks, and finances itself there are two 
approaches to the procedure for amending the Law on the Central 
Bank of the Russian Federation. The subcommittee headed by Boris 
Fedorov defends the variant of direct replacement of the 
existing law with the new one (including, in the author's words, 
the content of the former law). But the representatives of the 
subcommittee on banks support a different position and suggest, 
in order not to drag out the procedure of updating the law, 
adopting the main amendments to the present law in this 
parliamentary session and working in parallel on its articles. 
Most likely the further procedural fate of the amendments in 
banking law will follow the latter scenario, for practically 
everyone in attendance blamed the developers of the law on the 
Bank of Russia for the fact that the articles of the law were 
not looked at by an attorney, and as a result the law does not 
correspond at all to the law on banks and banking. 
  It must be noted here that, in addition to the deputies, 
participants in the discussion of the draft law on the Central 
Bank included representatives of the Association of Russian 
Commercial Banks, the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and 
three banks who are agents of the government (Tekhnobank, 
Stolichnyy Bank, and Most-Bank). According to KOMMERSANT's 
information the heads of other leading commercial banks were not 
invited to the meeting. The lack of a banking quorum, naturally, 
had an effect on the constructiveness of the debate. (In this 
connection the former parliament has to be given credit for the 
fact that the deputies last year found a way to bring in almost 
all the banking elite to a similar meeting to discuss amendments 
to banking law). 
  The people at this meeting gave primary attention to the 
provisions of the draft law on the Supervisory Council at the 
Central Bank, the prohibition of Central Bank participation in 
the capital of commercial structures, the functions of the 
Central Bank in operations to service the foreign debt, the 
prohibition on preferential credit for the budget, and the right 
of the Ministry of Finance to "veto" Central Bank decisions. 
  The key issue over which fights flared up was the planned 
creation of a Supervisory Council at the Bank of Russia, 
consisting of 11 persons representing the Central Bank itself, 
commercial banks, government servants, industrialists, 
agrarians, and scholars, who are elected for terms of 5 years. 
In the opinion of the lawmakers, the Supervisory Council should 
take part in adoption of decisions that are crucial for the 
banking and finance system (that is, determine Bank strategy) 
without interfering with its operational activity. 
  Formation of the Supervisory Council at the Central Bank, 
proposed by the draft law and expected, in the words of the 
deputies, to "reflect the interests of all strata of the 
population," is directly tied, in the opinion of KOMMERSANT 
experts, to the question of representation in these very strata. 
The impression is formed that the authors of the draft intended 
to establish something like a mini-parliament at the Central 
Bank. 
  The statement by Aleksandr Khandruyev, deputy chairman of 
the 
Central Bank, on this problem was quite emotional. He 
determinedly opposed the establishment of oversight over the 
Bank of Russia and stated that creating the institution of a 
"collective chairman" would threaten the Central Bank's 
constitutional right to independence. 
  In the words of Aleksandr Khandruyev, the ability of this 
body, formed in part from representatives of nonbanking circles, 
to make professional decisions on specifically banking issues 
raises doubt. Concurrently the fears of the Central Bank deputy 
chairman raise the possibility of lobbying for the interests of 
a narrow group of people through the new body. At the same time 
Aleksandr Khandruyev confirmed that the Bank of Russia has 
developed its own version of the law, which envisions the 
formation of a similar coordinating council, but one with purely 
consultative powers. 
  KOMMERSANT experts note for their part that if the idea of 
the Supervisory Council is put into effect the Russian banking 
system will instantly be changed from a two-level system into a 
kind of cyclical system unlike anything in world practice--bank 
representatives of the second level will have the right of a 
deciding vote in determining the strategy of the federal bank 
while it, in its turn, will embody this strategy by regulating 
the activities of those same second-level banks. The 
intellectual force of this idea can be compared, for example, 
with assigning the Dembelskiy Council of the General Staff to 
develop Russian military doctrine. 
  But another requirement of the Central Bank, that it refrain 
from commercial activity, received unanimous support at the 
meeting. (It apparently was assumed that this meant Central Bank 
participation in the capital of certain banks.) The result of a 
prohibition on participation in the capital of commercial banks 
should be withdrawal of the Central Bank as a shareholder in 
Sberbank and Vneshtorgbank (the Central Bank has already 
announced its withdrawal as a shareholder of the Sofintreyd 
Company, see KOMMERSANT No 17, p 5) and its refusal to 
participate in joint foreign banks. In our view, however, this 
measure will require development of an alternative path for 
state credits and a change in state policy relative to private 
persons. In fact, if Sberbank loses its primary shareholder, the 
state, will state guarantees of personal deposits be preserved? 
And if they are preserved, who will provide them and on what 
basis? 
  Deputy minister of finance Andrey Kazmin, supporting the 
draft as a whole, said that for now one should not talk (or 
write articles into the law) about refusing to grant credit to 
the budget at preferential interest, just as the functions of 
servicing the foreign debt should not be transferred to the 
state treasury that is being created. At the same time Andrey 
Kazmin did not agree with the right granted to the Central Bank 
to issue state securities ("1-year term") because he considers 
it improper for the same entity to issue securities and the 
rubles that support them. At first glance this appears to be a 
solid argument, but nonetheless it does not seem indisputable to 
us. After all, the Ministry of Finance, for example, still has 
not been refused the right to extinguish unpaid budget debts 
with its own notes and to issue "gold" certificates while it has 
the state gold reserve at its disposal. 
  The bankers in attendance supported Boris Fedorov's draft 
law. They were especially enthusiastic about the intention to 
establish oversight over the Bank of Russia. In support of this 
point of view the representative of Most-Bank cited the flagrant 
fact that for 18 months the Central Bank has not had a chief of 
the administration of commercial banks (in fact the functions of 
director were assigned to the acting director). But the speaker 
did not want to be consistent and did not demand that oversight 
be established over the Ministry of Finance for the same reason 
(where the minister himself is only an "acting" minister). 
  The attitude of representatives of the ARB [possibly 
Association of Russian Banks] toward the draft law on the 
Central Bank appeared ambiguous to observers. On the one hand 
the draft was supported, yet on the other during his closing 
speech Sergey Yegorov, president of the ARB, suddenly 
"sidestepped" by declaring that the association cannot make a 
final choice because its specialists have not yet seen the 
version of the draft law prepared by the Bank of Russia (the 
silent reproach against the Central Bank seemed fair). 
  For their part, having carefully studied the draft law on 
the 
Central Bank prepared by the Duma in the context of other laws 
adopted recently, the KOMMERSANT experts were amazed to find the 
prospect that the Central Bank of Russia would be defenseless 
against the curious outside glance. It is not even a matter of 
the Supervisory Council which, as already noted, is less for 
supervision than to make strategic decisions during the very 
process of which--if it does not become a mockery--it will be 
assumed that there is access to all strategic and operational 
information. In addition to the existence of the Council and the 
need for exhaustive reports to the parliament, according to the 
new draft law the Central Bank "is obligated to consult with the 
government on monetary-credit and currency questions and provide 
requested information" (Article No 23). Along with this, under 
the law on the status of deputy (which has gone through all the 
stages of confirmation by parliament) the Bank of Russia must 
throw open the door to any curious lawmaker, immediately review 
his questions, dump the most secret documents into his lap, and 
allow the guest into the Council of Directors. Our KOMMERSANT 
experts, chiefly from a feeling of humanism and compassion for 
the state banking system, will refrain from congratulating the 
Central Bank on its conversion into an information-consulting 
structure to which we are related in spirit. 
  It appears that under the set of laws adopted and proposed 
for adoption the concept of banking and commercial secrecy in 
Russia would de facto cease to exist. (Let us note that de jure 
it remains unclear: does the concept of banking secrecy apply to 
the state bank of Russia? The Duma draft law does not clarify 
this, and the issue was not touched on during the discussion.) 
In other words, there are already several hundred persons today 
(deputies, Duma apparatchiks, and state officials) who will 
receive direct access to information coming into the Central 
Bank and not falling in the category of state secrets. But this 
information will include not just figures on the rate of 
inflation "for the report period," but also, for example, 
information on second-order bank balances, the currency 
positions of exchange players, and the passports of export (and 
in the future import) transactions. 
  At the same time we are inclined to think that this issue 
was 
left practically untouched (if we disregard the statements by 
Aleksandr Khandruyev above about a possible surge in lobbying) 
during the Duma discussion just because the representatives of 
banking and business circles who attended the discussion 
organized by Boris Fedorov were, putting it mildly, not entirely 
representative.

Viktorov: "Economic Policy: "Attack in Waves"] 
  [Text] The Russian political Olympus has already 
adapted itself fully to Boris Yeltsin's decisive steps following 
long pauses. An analysis of the package of presidential edicts, 
which was received for official distribution yesterday, shows 
that during the latest splash of the president's interest in 
economic policy his advisers demonstrated maximum inventiveness 
in the manipulation of the meager arsenal of economic regulation 
measures. Tax rates, quotas, export duties, and the infamous 
"restoration of the controllability of the state sector"--what 
else can be applied to the Russian economy without its lethal 
outcome? 
  "On the other hand, what variations!" presidential 
experts will answer us. And they will be right here. 
<H5>  New Stage: What To Do if There Is no Money in the Budget </H5>
  Despite the apparent heterogeneity, upon closer examination 
the new presidential edicts fully fit into a single logical 
scheme, which makes it possible to talk about a new stage in 
Russian macroeconomic policy. Recently, the need for innovations 
in this policy has been quite obvious, even if in connection 
with the debates on the annual budget and forthcoming 
negotiations with Western creditors. To put it bluntly, it was 
necessary to demonstrate new methods of budget stimulation of 
the economy under conditions of the financial crisis. 
  These methods suggest themselves. If there is a shortage of 
money for direct budget support, the only thing left is "to 
help" enterprises through a reduction in the profit and 
added-value tax rate, at the same time, liberalizing 
raw-material export through an abolition of quotas. Despite the 
fact that individual elements of such a "new policy" also 
occurred earlier, essentially, in pure form they are first 
encountered in the new edicts "On Some Questions of Tax Policy" 
and "On the Abolition of Quotas and Licenses for Deliveries of 
Goods and Services for Export." The similarity of production 
stimulation through a tax cut with "Reaganomics" is evident 
immediately. Aleksandr Livshits, director of the group of 
economic advisers to the president, who was the ideologist of 
the new edicts, also drew these analogies with satisfaction. 
True, Russian state enterprises have some specific features. 
Most of them are so inefficient that tax indulgences and export 
liberalization are of purely symbolic significance for them. 
Therefore, some differentiation of state enterprises is quite 
logical. Public enterprises, which are not capable of managing 
state property independently and will be completely dependent on 
the government for support, are singled out among them in a 
separate edict.

<H5>  System of Criteria for Evaluating the Structure of the </H5>
Balance of Insolvent Enterprises: 
  --the coefficient of current liquidity: It characterizes the 
enterprise's general provision with circulating capital for the 
management of economic activity; 
  --the coefficient of provision with internal capital: It 
characterizes the availability of the enterprise's own 
circulating capital necessary for its financial stability; 
  --the coefficient of restoration (loss) of solvency: It 
characterizes the enterprise's real capability to restore or 
lose its solvency during a specific period. 
  [End Box] 
  Having announced the possibility of reducing some tax rates, 
authorities should find alternative sources of budget 
replenishment. Therefore, emphatic concern for a fuller 
collection of existing taxes contained in the new edicts is 
fully legitimate. In particular, such a measure is specified by 
the mentioned edict on the abolition of quotas, which, at the 
same time, presupposes the complete elimination of privileges 
with respect to the payment of export duties (according to 
Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, another edict on the 
complete elimination, in general, of all foreign economic 
privileges is already ready for signing). Two edicts at once--on 
ensuring a full payment of taxes into the budget and on measures 
to strengthen payment discipline--presuppose the toughening of 
control over tax collection. Generally speaking, such measures 
do not contradict the idea of tax stimulation of production. For 
example, in the United States in the 1980's the policy of tax 
rate cuts completely agreed with the exceptionally tough control 
over a prompt tax payment. Finally, the consolidation of 
extrabudgetary funds in the budget--to which, in particular, the 
edict on the inclusion of the federal road fund in the budget 
attests--is a fully expected measure. 
  [Begin box] 
<H5>  What Will the Abolition of Customs Privileges Give the Budget </H5>
  --Existing legislation exempts main exporters--oil and 
natural gas producers--from the payment of export duties. 
  --The share of oil and natural gas in the value volume of 
Russian export outside the former USSR makes up 35.7 percent. 
  --The abolition of customs privileges will enable the 
federal 
budget to obtain 2.5 billion dollars from the export of oil and 
gas in the form of customs duties in the second half of 1994. 
  --If customs duties on the export of oil and gas (as the 
government plans) are reduced to one-half before 1 July, 
currency budget revenues will total 1.25 billion dollars. 
  [End box] 
  Despite the fact that the scheme embodied in edicts is quite 
logical, it remains no more than a symbolic redistribution of 
budget indicators on paper. It is characteristic that Mr. 
Livshits, discussing real prospects for changes in tax policy, 
confined himself to the significant word "we will see." It is 
clear that attempts to develop a new economic policy under 
conditions of the budget crisis will continue in the very near 
future, as long as, in particular, the problem of finding funds 
for expanded budget support for the military-industrial complex 
is not solved. The issue of special "defense" bonds is the most 
obvious way out here. Livshits tends precisely toward this 
option. He is confident that banks will buy these bonds 
willingly. 
<H5>  Quotas, Licenses, and Privileges, But Not Special Exporters, </H5>
Are Eliminated 
  With his edict "On the Abolition of Quotas and Licenses for 
Deliveries of Goods and Services for Export" the president 
renews the liberalization of foreign economic activity. At the 
same time, the president's decision, despite the sufficiently 
long preparation, clearly stunned government structures with its 
radicality. 
  In accordance with the presidential edict the existing 
system 
of quotas and licenses for the export of goods is abolished as 
of 1 July. An exception was made only for export deliveries 
carried out in accordance with Russia's international 
obligations. In addition to quotas and licenses, the government 
is ordered to abolish as of 1 July 1994 all privileges with 
regard to the imposition of export customs duties on exported 
goods. This measure does not concern privileges granted by the 
laws "On Customs Tariff," "On the Added-Value Tax," and "On 
Excises," as well as by the Customs Code. 
  According to the version of authors of the presidential 
edict, all the privileges directly named in the mentioned laws 
are abolished. However, the law "On Customs Tariff" also gives 
grounds for a less revolutionary interpretation. It specifies 
that the government has the right to grant tariff privileges. 
Consequently, the pause in the labor biography of privileges, 
most probably, will not be long. 
  Nor are there grounds for putting the equality sign between 
the abolition of export quotas and the demise of nontariff 
regulation of export as such. As is well known, in the 
government decree "On Measures for the Liberalization of Foreign 
Economic Activity" of 2 November 1993 special exporters received 
a strong safety net, of which they can fully take advantage now. 
The November decree added another list to the list of goods, for 
which quotas were established: A list of goods, the export of 
which was monopolized by special exporters. The second list, 
having absorbed the first, naturally, was not limited to it and 
was longer. Thus, the abolition of quotas only strengthens the 
positions of special exporters. 
  The results of the meeting held by the board of the Ministry 
of Foreign Economic Relations yesterday, following the 
publication of the presidential edict, which abolished export 
quotas and licenses, fully confirm this conclusion. In 
particular, the development of the currency control system as 
applied to special exporters was examined. In this sphere the 
ministry continues to increase its own activity. It would seem 
that special exporters have been tamed strongly by the ministry 
for a long time. They "voluntarily" undertake to give the 
ministry information on the movement of currency funds. In 
addition, the ministry's attempt to outline the range of 
authorized banks allowed to service special exporters has 
received wide publicity. New proposals are being put forward 
now, confirming the forecast expressed by KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
yesterday. 
  First, the ministry tries to increase the gap between the 
two 
mentioned supplements to the November government decree on the 
liberalization of foreign economic activity. The list of goods 
assigned to special exporters is to be expanded. It can include 
not only individual commodity items, but also types of 
operations; in particular, the export of customer-supplied raw 
materials. Second, barter operations with energy carriers and a 
barter with the remaining goods falling under quotas, which 
provides for the import of goods subject to excise, are to be 
prohibited as a category. Third, instead of the deceased quotas, 
there is to be a mandatory registration of export transactions 
involving goods formerly subject to quotas, without which export 
is impossible. Thus, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations 
again aspires to the first role in the currency control system. 
The justification boils down to the fact that the version of 
control of the Central Bank of Russia-the State Tariff Committee 
does not ensure price control. This argument is not very 
impressive if we take into account that the law reserves to the 
customhouse the right to determine the customs value. In 
essence, however, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations 
clearly seeks to take a departmental revenge and to become 
firmly established under new conditions. Although the 
innovations of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations 
received the support of Sergey Tsyplakov, director of the 
government's Department for Foreign Economic Relations, who was 
present at the meeting, observers consider their realization in 
a full volume improbable. 
  The quota-abolishing edict should have also had a point 
concerning tariff regulation. As Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin 
announced yesterday, it was expected that the edict, 
simultaneously with the abolition of privileges, would also 
reduce to one-half the rates of export tariff on raw-material 
goods. At the last stage, however, it was removed. Nevertheless, 
Mr. Shokhin believes that this decision will take place. And so, 
following the abolition of quotas exporters may also expect 
other pleasant surprises. 
<H5>  State and Enterprises: New Relations </H5>
  The edict "On Some Questions of Tax Policy" points to a 
change in the relations between the state and enterprises. 
Previously, Russian authorities quite consistently denied the 
possibility of a significant reduction in the general level of 
taxes on enterprises, confining themselves to the granting of 
individual tax privileges. The new document, on the contrary, 
specifies the submission of proposals for a 10- to 20-percent 
reduction in the level of profit and value-added tax rates by 
the government to the State Duma before 15 September of this 
year. At the same time, the government is instructed to 
introduce the mechanism of accelerated depreciation of fixed 
capital in "high technology sectors" within a 2-month period. 
Such indulgences officially are attributed to the need to weaken 
the tax pressure on commodity producers. Moreover, the edict 
provides for the exemption of the profit tax payment during 2 
years by enterprises, in whose charter fund foreign investments 
make up no less than 30 percent (and no less than 10 million 
dollars). 
  However, whereas for now a significant reduction in tax 
rates 
for Russian enterprises is postponed until the fall, the 
toughening of control over tax payment is being introduced right 
now. In accordance with the edicts "On the Implementation of 
Overall Measures for a Prompt and Full Payment of Taxes and 
Other Obligatory Payments Into the Budget" and "On Additional 
Measures for the Normalization of Settlements and Strengthening 
of Payment Discipline in the National Economy" every enterprise 
can have only one current and budget account in banks. Banks do 
not have the right to open accounts for enterprises if they are 
not registered in tax bodies. If within 10 calendar days an 
enterprise does not have ruble funds in its account, tax bodies 
are granted the right to collect by nonadversary procedure 
arrears in taxes and other obligatory payments from current 
currency accounts of enterprises. 
  For state enterprises the change in mutual relations with 
the 
state is not confined to taxes alone. The edict "On Reform of 
State Enterprises" provides for a complete suspension of the 
establishment of new federal state enterprises, that is, 
formally independent enterprises, to which state property is 
transferred for complete economic management. Part of existing 
state enterprises are liquidated and public plants, factories, 
and farms fully subordinate in their activity to the government 
are established on their basis. A use of allocated federal funds 
not according to the specific purpose, a lack of profit on the 
basis of results in the last 2 years, or a violation of the 
rules of use of state real estate (for example, its lease or 
sale) can be the basis for the transformation of state 
enterprises into public ones. 
  According to the intention of the edict's drafters, the 
transformation of enterprises into public ones should hinder the 
uncontrolled receipt of credits and machination with state real 
estate. From comments on the edict given by Mr. Livshits it 
follows that he considers such a transformation of enterprises 
unusual punishment. However, real sentiments among 
representatives of enterprises, as Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's 
recent meeting with them indicates, are somewhat different. They 
rather tend to view the acquisition of the status of a public 
enterprise as the reason to obtain access to such desired budget 
support. 
<H5>  President Said "b," Not Uttering "a" </H5>
  The loud public response, which Boris Yeltsin's signing of 
six "economic" edicts received, somewhat overshadowed the fact 
that this package was published in truncated form. Two announced 
edicts--"On the Sale of State Debtor Enterprises" and "On the 
Regulation of Funds Assigned for Consumption"--did not come out 
from the presidential office. The first, perhaps the most 
important of all the documents scheduled for signing, should 
determine the government strategy with regard to the fate of 
bankrupt enterprises. However, right now it can be said that, 
for all practical purposes, national industrial giants have 
nothing to worry about. 
  By yesterday the government has already formulated the 
slogan, under which the fight against unpromising production 
facilities will be waged. As First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets 
thinks, "the prevention of bankruptcies themselves, not a mass 
conduct of bankruptcy show trials, is the chief thing." There is 
logic in such a maxim: The prospects for facing thousands of 
simultaneously conducted trials (by today only 70 such cases, 
including against state enterprises, have passed through the 
Russian court system), dozens of millions of unemployed workers, 
and, above all, hundreds of idle directors can frighten not only 
the Russian Government. The document prepared by the Federal 
Administration for Cases of Insolvency under the State Committee 
on the Administration of State Property indicates that such 
prospects are more than real. 
  The government decree published yesterday establishes a 
system of criteria, by which this department will be guided when 
declaring a state enterprise insolvent (it is also a matter of 
joint-stock companies, the share of the state in which is more 
than 25 percent). When only one criterion--the coefficient of 
current liquidity--was used, 601 production associations got on 
the black list. The total number of enterprises with more than 
1,000 workers is about 1,200. It is remarkable that 36 percent 
of them are enterprises of the military-industrial complex a 
priori considered high technology ones. More generalized 
indicators show that from 78 to 90 percent of the machine 
building enterprises are insolvent. 
  At the same time, the government realizes that it does not 
have real resources--primarily financial--for the "prevention of 
bankruptcy." According to Igor Shurchkov, chairman of the State 
Committee on Industrial Production, all bankruptcy prevention 
procedures can be carried out in full volume only at 100 
enterprises. In this connection the attempt to somehow divide 
all insolvent enterprises seems fully justified. In this case 
the watershed is a 25-percent share of the state in an 
enterprise. In other words, it objectively becomes profitable 
for enterprises to invite the state as a partner. Only in this 
case can they hope for state assistance (true, determined by 
formally tough criteria). However, a literal execution of 
legislation on bankruptcies awaits others.

<F P=106> [Interview with Federal Counterintelligence Service Director </F>
Sergey Stepashin by Vitaliy Tretyakov under the rubric "Special 
Services"; place and date not given: "Today the Russian 
President Holds a Conference With the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service Leadership; the Day Before, FCS 
Director Sergey Stepashin Answered NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
Questions"] 
  [Text] 
  [Tretyakov] As we agreed, my written questions will revolve 
mostly around FCS participation in economic crime suppression. 
Therefore, let us, please, start with this: Does today's FCS 
have the resources for a serious--and most importantly, 
effective--fight against economic crime and corruption? One gets 
the impression that state security cadres are crushed or 
demoralized. Many can be bribed because life is hard and bribes 
are generous. Is there a program to combat economic crime--for 
example, one that would allow the netting of a whole mafiosi 
clan, freezing its bank accounts, arresting the leaders, 
neutralizing the musclemen, etc., in one day? 
  [Stepashin] This year an economic counterintelligence 
directorate and corresponding local units have been set up 
within the FCS; their tasks include, among other things, the 
problems you mentioned. The system of economic 
counterintelligence was not created from scratch--it was build 
on the basis of BKK (suppression of contraband and corruption) 
units in the former Ministry of Security [MB], which had 
accumulated considerable experience in this work. Operational 
units recently were staffed by young operatives--FCS Academy 
graduates. People are in the mood for work. 
  Of course, we lost a number of highly skilled specialists. 
Some went to work for commercial structures (our professionals 
are highly sought everywhere and offered salaries that sometimes 
are tens of times higher than what they were paid in the 
government service); some went to the tax police, where salaries 
also are one and a half to two times as high. And some simply 
got tired of endless reorganizations and uncertainty. 
  I want to mention, by the way, that unfortunately our 
society 
has not yet realized that a poor--and hence weak--special 
service in the final count costs the state dearly. For instance, 
they calculate how much it costs to maintain us (which, by the 
way, is considerably less than in developed countries) and 
complain that this burden has to be carried by the taxpayer. A 
special service that functions normally, however, not only pays 
for itself but also saves the state enormous money. It is just 
that the results are not always on the surface for everyone to 
see. But such is the specificity of our work. For instance, you 
can calculate in rubles the gain from counterintelligence 
preventing a deal worth billions that is known to be 
disadvantageous for the state, or illegal exports of oil from 
Russia by train load. But how do you put a price on closing off 
a channel through which commercial information leaks to foreign 
competitors, halting the activities of a bureaucrat who takes 
large bribes, liquidating an international narcotics ring, 
keeping foreign crooks from participating in the privatization 
of a domestic plant, or keeping the authorities informed of 
concrete threats of a strategic nature in the economic sphere? 
  A considerable part of our operational information along the 
line of suppression of economic crime and corruption is put to 
use through investigative units of other law enforcement organs 
(the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD], Procuracy, tax police, 
and customs). This fact is frequently overlooked. 
  In unmasking dangerous manifestations of economic crime we 
also actively work together with internal affairs organs and the 
Procuracy. As to "netting" an entire mafiosi clan, technically 
this is not a problem for us. The tricky part is the law, which 
still does not define what constitutes organized crime and a 
criminal organization. As they say, you cannot nail down 
something that does not exist--so if there is no clan, there are 
no leaders and no bank accounts. What does exist are individuals 
committing (or even not committing) concrete crimes covered by 
the Criminal Code. 
  To strong-arm groups we can apply Criminal Code Article 77 
(gangsterism), but it covers "armed gangs intent on attacking 
state or public enterprises or individuals." As you can see, 
those who "quietly and peacefully" pocket illegal billions 
cannot be charged under this article. 
  [Tretyakov] Few people in society doubt that corruption has 
reached the very top. But the FCS is not the former KGB; there 
are already special services of higher rank--for example, the 
presidential. Can the FCS effectively fight corruption in the 
top echelons of power under these circumstances? 
  [Stepashin] Current legislation places corruption 
suppression 
in the top echelons within FCS competence, and the fact that 
there exist other special services does not keep us from 
carrying out our tasks. I will note in passing that I do not 
believe that there are special services of "higher" or "lower" 
rank. Although if you mean financial maintenance, then some 
Russian special services are indeed "above" the FCS. But we get 
"consolation" from the better skills and higher professionalism 
of our staff. This is what keeps us going. 
  Speaking, however, of law enforcement organs whose interests 
may cross, our opinion is unequivocal: Monopolism in the sphere 
of combating corruption and dangerous types of economic crime is 
absolutely impermissible. Not only is there enough work for 
everyone--there will still be some left. Also, do not forget 
that corruption has penetrated law enforcement organs as well. 
  [Tretyakov] Do you have a feeling that important information 
quite often is leaked from your agency and other agencies, and 
also that propaganda campaigns are launched that play into the 
hands of corrupt structures? 
  [Stepashin] Our society has become more open today. 
Sometimes 
more than necessary. Nowadays some staff members of our agency 
quite often (perhaps too often) give interviews to the mass 
media. We have not had leaks of important information, though. 
In the country as a whole, however, such a trend regretfully 
does exist. What can one do... society becomes commercialized; 
information has become a commodity, too, and some bureaucrats 
are not above selling it. 
  As to propaganda campaigns, we feel it very clearly these 
days. Criminal structures have enormous money, and propaganda 
also is an investment, and potentially very profitable. They 
gain a lot, for instance, from discrediting law enforcement 
organs and special services. They understand very well that the 
attitude towards counterintelligence on the part of not only the 
society but also of the president is formed to a large extent 
under the influence of the mass media. Discreditation is 
conducted both in general and on specific cases. 
  In the course of investigation and trial in the case of an 
attempt to illegally export from Russia a large consignment of 
diesel fuel, there were frank attempts to discredit FCS 
investigators and operatives. Materials organized in the 
newspapers KOMMERSANT, SVOBODNAYA ZONA, and 24 portrayed special 
services as structures standing in the way of economic 
transformations, organizing persecution of "private" 
entrepreneurs. Along the same lines, through connections of the 
accused, a television report was organized. After the 
allegations had been checked authoritatively, the rulings on all 
complaints were in favor of the investigation, while the 
Baltiyskiy Rayon court in Kaliningrad indicted a group of 
persons on the charges of smuggling. There are quite a few such 
facts. 
  There have been numerous actions of this kind in connection 
with the investigation of criminal abuse of an official position 
by the former head of administration of Penza Oblast--when his 
unlawful activities were made public some mass media presented 
it as an attempt to "discredit a democratic official." 
  You probably noticed at the time the tidal wave of materials 
promulgating the theme that shadow capital will give a positive 
impulse to the national economy. As we can see now, there is 
no--and had not been any--impulse, while enormous unlawfully 
obtained capital had been successfully "laundered" and now every 
day we see on television the commercials of some companies, 
whose prosperity was built on an extremely questionable 
foundation. Here is an example of profitable propaganda. 
  Alas, some newspapers, radio stations, and television 
companies actually turned into frankly commercial enterprises. I 
would like to use this opportunity to address the mass media: Do 
not be so omnivorous. Find in yourself the strength to refuse a 
good profit if the information offered to you leaves a bad 
aftertaste or comes from questionable individuals. 
  [Tretyakov] Much is being said about economic crime and 
corruption, but I cannot recall any major or at least 
sensational disclosure, let alone a trial. What can the FCS show 
in this respect? 
  [Stepashin] I do not agree with you. There have been and are 
disclosures. And will be. Examples? Here are some of the latest 
that I can now talk about. 
  In November 1993, on the basis of materials of the former 
MB's Yaroslavl Oblast Directorate, at the oblast procuracy's 
request, A.F. Gusev, deputy head of the oblast administration, 
was dismissed from his job for participating in commercial 
structure activities for personal gain. 
  In January 1994, the FCS's St. Petersburg city and oblast 
directorate initiated criminal proceedings against L.V. 
Savenkov, deputy mayor of St. Petersburg and chairman of the 
mayoralty committee on trade, public catering, consumer services 
and city food supply, who had attempted to organize the 
smuggling out of the city of 7.5 tonnes of caviar worth R40 
million, as well as setting up production of a platinum group 
metal--osmium-187--for selling abroad. Among items confiscated 
from Savenkov were more than $10,000, other foreign currency, 
R3.5 million, credit cards and documents indicating existence of 
accounts in foreign banks, 15 kinds of foreign-made television 
and radio equipment, a Walther handgun with ammunition, and 
other unregistered weapons. 
  On the basis of materials collected by the Russian FCS's 
Pskov Oblast Directorate, the Procuracy initiated criminal 
proceedings under RSFSR Criminal Code Article 78 (contraband) 
against A.I. Kabanov, deputy chairman of the oblast committee 
for the administration of state property, who had organized the 
smuggling of metals out of the country and weapons into the 
country. Eight persons were arrested with him. The materials 
were referred to court. 
  The economic counterintelligence directorate has uncovered 
unlawful activities of a far-flung criminal association with the 
participation of central staff officers of the MVD and a number 
of other law enforcement organs (more than 20 persons 
altogether). In exchange for large bribes, they carried out the 
orders of professional criminal groups in the Moscow 
region--dropping criminal charges against their members who were 
under investigation for muggings, robberies, smuggling, and 
illegal possession of arms, as well as changing the measure to 
secure court appearance, reducing the sentence handed down by 
the court, and so on. Criminal proceedings were initiated and 
referred to the office of the procurator general of Russia. 
  I would like to note that the experience of FCS units shows 
considerable difficulties that arise in investigating and 
stopping incidents of corruption among high-ranking officials, 
who actively use their official position, influence, and 
connections in higher echelons of power and administration to 
circumvent the measures aimed at unmasking and documenting their 
unlawful actions. 
  It does not help to fight corruption in the top echelons of 
power that there is no legal--and much needed--mechanism to 
require persons authorized to perform state functions to declare 
their income, real and personal property, bank deposits, and 
securities. 
  We also hope that the process of developing and adopting 
laws 
on suppression of corruption, organized crime, witness 
protection, and protection of members of law enforcement organs 
and special services will be speeded-up. 
  [Tretyakov] How can the FCS help to solve the problem of 
holes in the borders--a very important problem in crime 
suppression? 
  [Stepashin] The problem of holes in the borders is directly 
tied with the plundering of the national wealth of Russia. It is 
common knowledge on what an immense scale raw materials, 
components, and products are illegally exported abroad. 
Counterintelligence organs, within their competence, take steps 
in the existing circumstances to close the contraband channels. 
But the extent of the "transparency" of the borders makes it 
impossible to fight contraband effectively not just with our own 
resources and means, but also for the border troops, the customs 
committee, and internal affairs organs. Many issues need to be 
resolved not so much from the angle of "enforcement" agencies as 
through reducing the intensity of economic problems and 
regulation of export mechanisms. This involves first and 
foremost the transit of freight into Kaliningrad Oblast, a 
considerable part of which does not reach its destination and 
remains in the Baltic countries, from where it proceeds to the 
West. 
  A major problem is bringing order into the entry, exit, and 
stay of foreigners, as well as persons without citizenship, in 
Russia. Today there is complete chaos in this. We can only guess 
more or less how many and of whom there are here. On the other 
hand, members of criminal groups, gangsters, easily obtain 
Russian foreign-travel passports in assumed names and travel 
abroad. 
  We need a single interagency system of registration for 
foreigner entry, exit, and stay, an integrated electronic 
databank. This will enable us in principle to monitor the flow 
of foreigners, identify undesirables (terrorists, international 
crooks, persons wanted by Interpol and other law enforcement 
agencies) as they enter our territory. 
  This, however, presents another problem. Such a registration 
system will only be effective if the border is "under lock and 
key." And what do we have now? We periodically run into a 
situation where known intelligence officers easily slip into 
Russia undetected through the borders of CIS countries, and we 
only learn of their presence here by accident. 
  [Tretyakov] In this connection, what is the level and volume 
of contacts with the sister special services of CIS countries? 
  [Stepashin] Being a legal successor of the Russian MB, 
including in matters of international cooperation, the FCS works 
on the basis of previously signed agreements on cooperation and 
interaction with special services and security organs of most of 
the CIS member states. We are doing some practical rewriting and 
preparation work to get analogous agreements with other CIS 
member states special services and security organs ready for 
signing. This creates and strengthens the contract-legal base 
for cooperation in the form of intergovernment and interagency 
international agreements. 
  We maintain regular contacts with our foreign partners' 
representatives in Moscow, exchange delegations on the agency 
level, hold working meetings of experts. 
  All of this permits the Russian FCS to interact with 
partners 
in CIS countries on various issues for the purpose of preventing 
harm to Russia's interests in political, economic, and 
military-strategic areas. 
  Built on this basis, cooperation between special services 
produces concrete results. We have examples of successful 
counterintelligence operations conducted with partners from CIS 
countries in the sphere of disrupting illegal drug trafficking, 
combating terrorism, and smuggling arms and explosives. The 
cooperation that is developing along the lines of combating 
transborder organized crime also is producing results. 
  In the sphere of economic counterintelligence, we work 
together on such matters as halting illegal exports of petroleum 
products from Russia, uncovering, preventing, and stopping 
crimes in the financial and banking sphere, ensuring security of 
transportation, and others. 
  [Tretyakov] Can we hope that the FCS, while not ready today 
to deal a decisive blow to economic crime and corruption, at 
least is accumulating information that creates a beachhead for a 
future offensive? 
  [Stepashin] First of all, I want to say that this problem 
has 
been neglected for too long. Therefore we cannot hope to solve 
it overnight. We work on the premise that we will have to 
conduct a protracted, so to say, trench warfare against economic 
crime, including corruption. This is the target we set for our 
operational directorates. Taking this into account, we currently 
considerably increased information analysis work. You see, in 
the new environment the economic mechanism in some elements 
develops spontaneously, which immediately is taken advantage of 
by dishonest businessmen and corrupt officials. It may not be 
very difficult to catch them red-handed, but to reveal the 
hidden springs of economic crime, its, so to speak, nature in 
different spheres of economic-financial activities is one of the 
most important tasks of information analysis work. We our 
analysts are oriented toward in-depth analysis of the 
information we receive, preparation of predictive evaluations, 
and conclusions for the higher political leadership of the 
country. They also incorporate proposals on changes needing to 
be made to legislative acts and normative documents in order to 
close the loopholes permitting abuse. This is, briefly, our 
contribution to, as you put it, the beachhead for a future 
offensive. 
  By the way, although, as I said, in fighting economic crime 
we have always coordinated our work with other special services 
and law enforcement organs, with which we have signed (or are 
getting ready to sign) agreements on cooperation, it would 
benefit our common cause to delineate more clearly the sphere of 
competence between different agencies dealing with economic 
crime. 
  [Tretyakov] Facts, versions, and rumors related to the 
murder 
and funeral of Otari Kvantrishvili undoubtedly plunged the 
society into pessimism regarding the balance of forces in this 
sphere. Everybody (or almost everybody) saw that today even the 
former KGB, let alone the MVD, is virtually powerless in facing 
the mighty "kingpins" of organized crime. Would you care to 
argue this? 
  [Stepashin] Facts, versions, rumors--let us sort this out. 
Facts are the basis of versions that are now being developed by 
the investigative organs jointly with operational units. Rumors, 
on the other hand, which are spread mostly by journalists in the 
mass media, help to form precisely that kind of public opinion 
"regarding the balance of forces" that you are talking about. I 
cannot agree that these rumors "unquestionably plunged society 
into pessimism." My colleagues, who also are a part of 
society--and a considerable, active, and educated part of it at 
that--despite the absence of laws on organized crime (how many 
years have they been under discussion, and finally the State 
Duma recently adopted in the first draft the law on corruption), 
without sufficient material and technical support, and many 
other things that I will not enumerate because it has been said 
an uncountable number of times--today, loyal to their duty, do 
everything possible to disrupt the criminal activities of 
mafiosi clans without falling into the "pessimism" of feeling 
"powerless" in facing the "mighty kingpins of organized crime." 
And I must tell you that they are working in this direction 
increasingly more confidently and achieving the desired results. 
So, in my view, there are no reasons for pessimism. 
  [Tretyakov] Democratic countries a have well-developed and 
efficiently operating system of parliamentary special service 
activities oversight. In your capacity as a deputy in the last 
Russian Supreme Soviet, you were one of the first people to 
begin to plant this practice on our soil. What is happening in 
this respect now? Who and how frequently will they inspect your 
agency; will you be presenting reports to special committees? 
How deeply, in your opinion, may parliament members get into 
your affairs? 
  [Stepashin] The need for counterintelligence organ activity 
oversight is predicated on their role and place in the total 
Russian state security system and their use of specific forms 
and methods of activities in dealing with the tasks with which 
they are charged, and keeping in mind that carrying out certain 
functions does not involve a certain limitation of citizens' 
rights and freedoms [sentence as published]. 
  The basis of the concept of overseeing counterintelligence 
organs activities must consist of two most important principles. 
  First, it is a guaranteed observance of rights and freedoms 
of the individual in counterintelligence organs carrying out 
their direct functions, when restriction of rights is permitted 
only on the grounds, conditions, and in accordance with the 
procedure envisaged by federal laws, and only with respect to 
persons committing actions aimed at inflicting harm on 
individuals, society, and the state. 
  Second, in carrying out and developing counterintelligence 
organ activity oversight forms, it is necessary to take into 
account their covert nature necessitated mainly by the 
specificities of combating intelligence and sabotage activities 
of foreign special services and organizations against the 
Russian Federation. 
  There is no question that those carrying out oversight of 
counterintelligence activities must have a different scope of 
powers defined by their role and place in the system of state 
and society. Among those authorized to carry out such oversight 
within the scope of their powers established by the Constitution 
and other legislative acts of the Russian Federation are the 
president, the Federal Assembly, and the Russian Federation 
Government. There is also judiciary oversight. 
  Currently, counterintelligence organ activity oversight is 
carried out by the Russian Federation president. The Russian 
Federation parliament has the right to oversee the use of the 
federal budget through the part of the means appropriated for 
the Russian FCS through the Accounting Chamber especially formed 
for these purposes. In addition, on matters of security, 
relevant Federation Council and State Duma committees may hold 
parliamentary hearings to which they may invite 
counterintelligence organ leaders. 
  Judiciary control and oversight by the procuracy organs play 
an increasingly greater role and significance with respect to 
compliance with the law in counterintelligence organs carrying 
out their activities. 
  [Tretyakov] What is the current "range" of FCS officers' 
pay? 
What percentage of officers leaving your agency do so for 
financial reasons? 
  [Stepashin] Of course, any serious company strives to 
acquire 
a specialist who has received a good education, has excellent 
professional training, possesses knowledge and skills that are 
so much needed in the difficult situation that exists today, 
especially in the sphere of business. 
  The so-called "range" of military rank pay for 
counterintelligence organ operatives is between R130,000 and 
R160,000. Otherwise, the cash pay of our officers, as well as of 
all Russian military servicemen, is set by the current 
legislation. If you take an "average" operative, that is, an 
officer with certain work experience, skills, years of service 
record, I can say that his cash pay does not exceed 
R280,000-R300,000 a month. 
  Speaking the language of figures, for instance, in 1993 up 
to 
29 percent of personnel were discharged at their own request and 
in connection with a transfer to civilian organizations and 
agencies. But I would not define the issue so narrowly. There is 
always a whole set of motives in leaving a job. 
  I have to be honest: There are instances when officers who 
have developed a negative attitude towards the service decide to 
leave under certain circumstances--for example, after receiving 
lucrative offers from commercial structures. 
  Does it create problems? Undoubtedly... For any special 
service the task of preserving and increasing the cadres' 
potential is a centerpiece issue. Its resolution affects to a 
large extent the coordination and effectiveness of 
counterintelligence organs operations. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
<H5>  When the answers to the questions submitted in advance </H5>
were ready, I met with Sergey Stepashin and continued the 
interview verbally. 
  [Tretyakov] Sergey Vadimovich, although you said (in 
particular, when you were in Kazakhstan and also in written 
replies to my questions) that the unlawful actions of a number 
of high-ranking bureaucrats--in the capital, as I gather--have 
been uncovered recently with the help of FCS; nevertheless, 
lately we have not heard of especially sensational resignations 
or trials. 
  [Stepashin] You simply missed some resignations. For 
example, 
Kuntsevich, some functionaries in the State Committee for the 
Administration of State Property. 
  [Tretyakov] I know of these, of course, but somehow did not 
connect them with FCS activities. Will you continue in this 
direction? 
  [Stepashin] We work on it all the time. You see, we set two 
tasks for ourselves. It is the kind of prevention, where a case 
that is not fully documented is put to work, because we do not 
have a sufficient legislative base to get the case to court. 
This is a topic that has been beaten to death, but you 
understand very well that many cases simply fall apart despite 
the fact that there obviously is a crime--abuse of official 
position or economic (not in the old meaning but as it is 
currently understood). But it is practically impossible to prove 
it. Therefore we summarize the facts, and since I have the right 
to report directly to the president and the prime minister, I 
report it to them. And I can say that there has not been a 
single instance where a corresponding reaction did not follow. 
And second: Unlike our former vice president, I will never 
permit myself to mention a single name until a decision is made. 
This is a sacred rule; otherwise you are pushing me back into 
the 1930's. But I can tell you that there are a great many 
instances of this kind. 
  The president now has signed several very tough edicts, 
which 
had been prepared with our participation; they will help in this 
work. I do not want to criticize the Duma--show me who does not 
engage in Duma-bashing these days--but for reasons you are aware 
of, right now it will not adopt such tough but necessary 
documents--there is a rather powerful lobby there that simply 
does not want them to come through. 
  [Tretyakov] But then it follows that in the near future, 
until the new economic and political structure of the society 
settles in, crime, the mafia--call it whatever you like--will 
have a considerable handicap, will they not? 
  [Stepashin] Undoubtedly. Both we and the MVD, working in new 
economic and political conditions, right now are behind in legal 
reinforcement. This is one thing. Another is that there is a 
group of people who by old socialist norms are law-breakers, but 
in reality are enterprising people, sometimes very famous, who, 
using loopholes in the law, not only make a lot of money for 
themselves but help others get richer. Where is that line? How 
do we find it? 
  Americans have the same problem. It is an established 
democracy, as we call it, but, nevertheless, it is a fact that 
there exist large mafiosi groups in both the economic and 
political life of the United States. In 1991, I met with the FBI 
leadership and asked them: How do you fight this? Very simple: 
They have their own agent network, and moreover, certain 
agreed-upon rules of the game, which the criminals cannot 
violate with impunity. And they know it. And finally, the most 
important part: a perfect tax system. The latter we do not have 
so far. As soon as it develops, we will be able to work very 
forcefully and effectively. 
  And, of course, the courts. This is what represents a 
headache today. We try to maneuver, talk about expanding rights 
of individuals, without understanding that today, in the 
environment of the disintegration of the USSR and the growing 
criminal element that is encroaching on political power, we have 
in some way given up the cut-and-dry understanding of human 
rights. I am not calling for a return to the 1930's, but 
survival of the society is at stake. Although in this we also 
have to find a certain line that justice cannot cross. 
  [Tretyakov] I think there is a dramatic change taking place 
in the public mind now in its attitude toward the agency of 
which you are the head, even if we take its old name--the KGB. 
Some people, who in the past could not speak of this 
organization without hatred, devote expansive panegyrics to it 
and generally appeal to it as the last resort that can protect 
society and them personally from danger. Unfortunately, this 
shows that society is scared--and very much so--by what is 
happening. 
  [Stepashin] You are right, the attitude is changing. And not 
only because people are scared (which unfortunately is true). No 
state service has undergone as much reforming over the past 
three years or has been X-rayed as much as the security service. 
I came into it in 1991 through the investigation commission on 
KGB activities, and I simply saw these people. And still it has 
retained its potential, and a certain integrity is still there. 
Wherever I go--and now I travel around the country a lot--the 
attitude is the same everywhere: We still trust them. And we 
have moved away from what we had been criticized for. The 
criticism was not against the KGB (by the way, this was a good 
acronym from the standpoint of contents--state security); the 
criticism was for one small part--the notorious Fifth 
Directorate that persecuted dissidents, and in fact very often 
stepped over the limit of the permitted and legal. But this was 
just a small part of the KGB--3 percent of its personnel. 
Although, of course, this was a real threat to individual 
freedom. However, we have to keep in mind three things here. 
That society was a closed one and this dictated certain actions 
of special services, which were secondary in relation to this 
function of preserving its closed nature. Second, and this is of 
principal importance for me. And by the way, President Clinton, 
addressing CIA personnel three months ago, actively emphasized 
this idea: Cooperation with special services is a sacred duty of 
every American citizen. Through such cooperation, including 
defending U.S. interests abroad, we defend the interests of all 
citizens of the United States of America. Is this a bad premise? 
  And I know that a considerable number of U.S. citizens, 
including journalists, without being CIA agents carry out 
certain tasks for it, first and foremost of an informational 
nature. I consider it quite natural. And we also should use such 
channels. And the third, the most important part--the 
1920's-1930's: repressions, terrible murders--nobody has any 
question that this was abhorrent. But this was mainly the work 
of the NKVD [People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs] and 
other organs. When we started looking into this, however, those 
who worked in the Committee for State Security became the fall 
guys, although they were mainly engaged in intelligence and many 
other things that constitute normal state functions. Now, after 
having worked here for several years, many things have become 
obvious to me. The reports, the most interesting memoranda that 
were going to Gorbachev, to the Politburo. I saw the latter's 
notations, the reaction--or, to be precise, most of the time the 
absence of any reaction. 
  Apparently these things have become obvious to many people 
today, and that is why the attitude toward us changed. 
  [Tretyakov] Since we have already wandered away somewhat 
from 
the economic crime topic, I wanted to ask you this question. Are 
there not too many special services in Russia now? To my 
knowledge, the so-called operational-investigative activities in 
Russia... 
  [Stepashin] ...are a province of six entities. 
  [Tretyakov] Now perhaps six, but in the Soviet Union there 
were only four. 
  [Stepashin] One--only the KGB. 
  [Tretyakov] Then we have to define more precisely what 
"operational-investigative activities" are. 
  [Stepashin] Yes, there was the MVD, and the Procuracy, but 
all technical measures--only we, including for the MVD. 
  [Tretyakov] And now there are six. And in the future, as far 
as I know, according to some plans--15 or 16. I think that when 
everybody "listens" to everybody, this creates more problems 
than security for the state. And, by the way, a much greater 
chance that these numerous special services will carry out tasks 
in the interests of internal political struggle than the state 
as a whole. 
  [Stepashin] This is a difficult question. Where did it all 
start? The tragedy of the USSR disintegration. And when the 
question had to be decided on splitting up special services, the 
decision was generally correct--there should not be a monster, 
monopolization of the entire structure, including the 
operational-technical part, in the business of ensuring state 
security. At the time, I believe, the motivation was logical. By 
the way, it did not raise any particular questions on the part 
of anyone. 
  Now regarding the current situation. That there are several 
services is good--there should be competition. This is a 
positive competition. But with respect to 
operational-investigative activities I agree: We need to reduce 
the number of structures that have a right to do this, because 
spreading the ability to conduct operational-technical measures 
takes these services from under control and I think that at a 
certain stage both the president and the government may lose 
this control. There is, however, another side to it, which is 
purely technical. We are somewhat behind in technology, but many 
commercial structures now have the ability to conduct the same 
operations, including tapping--today they are better equipped 
than we are, or even than the Main Protection Administration and 
the Presidential Security Service. We have to keep this danger 
in mind. In this area, technical countermeasures are needed. 
  We have prepared a memorandum for the prime minister on this 
subject, regarding a tough control, and sometimes a ban, on what 
is being manufactured and sold in Russia in this respect. We 
talk a lot about banning arms, but this is also a weapon. 
Sometimes an even more formidable one--a psychological weapon, 
if you wish. 
  As to these many services, in the law on the FCS that is now 
being prepared we will try if not to monopolize then at least to 
outline more precisely our primacy in conducting 
operational-technical measures. Even now we service a great 
number of MVD requests. 
  We are now moving toward agreements between our special 
services. We have already signed an agreement with the SVR--the 
presidential protection service. Within the next few days we 
will be ready to sign the same kind of agreement with the Main 
Protection Directorate. 
  There will be a whole package of orders in this area, 
including those issued together with the minister of internal 
affairs. Today, after three years of hiatus, we are coming to 
legal formalization of our relations. This is the first step. 
And this is our mutual desire, approved by the president. 
  [Tretyakov] I would like to once again come back to the 
problem of borders. Actually, Russia currently does not have 
borders. 
  [Stepashin] Russia does have borders. 
  [Tretyakov] How transparent is the obviously existing 
apparent border between Russia and the Baltic countries? As 
compared, for instance, to the border between Russia and Poland 
in 1985? 
  [Stepashin] Of course there are problems in this respect, 
but 
I think that before the middle of next year technically the 
borders will be tightly sealed. 
  [Tretyakov] And what about Caucasus? 
  [Stepashin] In the Caucasus, the situation is more 
difficult. 
On the president's behalf, I traveled to the North Caucasus 
republics in May. The latest trip was to Dagestan. There are 
numerous questions. Take for instance the border between Russia 
and Azerbaijan in Dagestan. In our opinion, it should be closed. 
The problem actually is not Azerbaijan per se but rather third 
countries--it is arms and many other things. We have different 
monetary systems. This causes substantial economic losses, first 
and foremost for Dagestan. This is obvious. But on the other 
hand... There are 200,000 Lezgins living on the territory of 
Azerbaijan, and 120,000, on the territory of Dagestan. Lezgins 
lived together for thousands of years. And now all of a sudden 
they will be told: This is it, a state border will cut through 
here. Their reaction is obvious. 
  Two points are important here. First: Azerbaijan is a CIS 
state. Therefore all of this should be firmly taken to the 
interstate level, setting up joint protection of the 
Azerbaijani-Iranian border, including in the interests of 
Russia. Because the "transparency" of the border in the Derbent 
area is beneficial for both Russia and Azerbaijan. Second. What 
is more important: to declare that this is a state border or to 
enforce border regulations? The latter, of course. Therefore, we 
need to create conditions for normal contacts between 
inhabitants of border areas, but at the same time, having set 
barriers through customs, through border guards, through the 
FCS's operational capabilities, to keep the interests of third 
countries--both intelligence and contraband--from succeeding. 
  In general, I would be very cautious in speaking of state 
borders with the former Soviet Union republics. I am deeply 
convinced that sooner or later we will be together. It will not 
be the Union in its old form, but to set a firm border means to 
draw a separation line both politically and psychologically. I 
talked on this subject, for instance, with Nazarbayev--he also 
supports this view. Kazakhstan's border with China? Yes, it 
needs to be closed. Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan? Yes, 
it needs to be closed. And with the participation of Russia. 
  [Tretyakov] Sergey Vadimovich, I want to ask about a problem 
that seems very complex and acute to me. Moscow today has turned 
into something that Paris was in the 1920's, when the bulk of 
Russian emigration at the time concentrated there. But that was 
mainly the Russian diaspora. Today in Moscow, because the former 
USSR republics now have become independent states, we have at a 
minimum 14 diasporas, quite often also consisting of conflicting 
sides: pro-government and opposition Tajiks; Tajiks and Uzbeks; 
Dniester region residents and Moldovans; Azerbaijanis and 
Armenians; Georgians and Abkhazians, and so on, and so on. Not 
to mention the warring groups from our North Caucasus republics. 
All of them, by the way, have to "lobby" the Russian leadership, 
various government and parliamentary structures in Moscow. This 
means money, which can be obtained from drug trafficking, and on 
top of that arms. And controlling traditional Moscow criminal 
groups of "ethnic coloration." I will not enumerate 
everything--let me just say that they can start a real war 
against one another in Moscow. This is the situation in the 
capital city that is completely new for Russian special 
services, especially considering that special services of the 
former Union republics, even if they do not work here against 
Russia, have to keep an eye on the situation in "their" diaspora. 
  [Stepashin] A timely question, because this problem exists 
and is becoming more acute, but we are only beginning to look 
into it. Yes, we know that there are such groups. Yes, we have 
some operational approaches through the prism of work against us 
on the part of special services of some CIS countries, but that 
problem which we have so far overlooked is a fact. We have 
looked habitually only at "classic" emigration--from China, 
Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and so on. But we, much like the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have taken a long time to become 
aware that those people who come today from other CIS countries 
are no longer Soviet citizens, that is, they are not Russian in 
its current sense, and they may have their own interests. 
  [Tretyakov] A question about our society "bearing arms" 
today. Since, as I assume, most weapons flow into private hands 
from the military, has the FCS established some control over the 
processes of weapons "leakage?" 
  [Stepashin] I have a very good reason to believe that the 
bulk of arms do not come from the military. We do have these 
processes under control over there through military 
counterintelligence--this structure is subordinate to us. We do 
not always do it well, but nevertheless the system is in place. 
Considerable quantities of weapons were lost in the beginning, 
when the Soviet Union disintegrated, but unified armed forces 
still existed. This is when a huge number of "appropriations" 
occurred. A huge number! Quite enough to arm several tens of 
thousands of men. A smaller part was used to set up our own 
armed forces, and the greater part went into the market. This is 
the most important point. 
  There is another aspect. As recently as a year ago there 
were 
many instances of uncontrolled production and sales of arms, 
including firearms, by many enterprises and organizations. Today 
it has been placed under control, albeit as yet incomplete. 
  And the third source is the flow of arms coming as transit 
shipments through third countries. For instance, an Estonian 
commercial company purchased 300,000 TT handguns in China, which 
went into Russian markets. We catch them mostly in St. 
Petersburg--once we seized a consignment of several hundred 
handguns at once. But this is only one example. 
  And fourth: I believe that we were too hasty in adopting the 
law on arms. I am categorically against selling arms to the 
population, because the population is not going to protect 
itself with these weapons--first and foremost they will end up 
in the hands of criminal elements. 
  [Tretyakov] And the last question: on the "classic" presence 
of Western special services in Russia. 
  [Stepashin] Nobody is making a secret of the trend for more 
vigorous activities by Western special services in Russia. This 
stems from three reasons. First: Western Europe and the United 
States are concerned about what is happening in Russia and where 
it may lead. Second--the economic difficulties, especially in 
the military-industrial complex, and the tremendous interest in 
our new technological developments. They know that we have great 
technological achievements on the level of the 21st Century. It 
is very easy to get your hands on them now. And the third reason 
is traditional. As long as the state exists, special service 
activities against other countries will continue. I am convinced 
that nobody intends to destroy Russia, but there are many who do 
not want this huge country, after it finally gets on its feet, 
to present increasing political and economic competition to the 
West.

<H5>  Russian Federation Government Decree No. 498, of 20 May </H5>
1994: "On Some Measures to Implement Legislation on Insolvency 
(Bankruptcy) of Enterprises" 
  For the purposes of implementing legislation of the Russian

<H5>  Attachment No. 1: System of Criteria for Determining That </H5>
the Structure of the Balance Sheet of Insolvent Enterprises Is 
Unsatisfactory 
  1. The following indicators shall be used to evaluate the 
satisfactoriness of the structure of the balance sheet of an 
enterprise: 
  the current liquidity ratio; 
  the internal liquidity ratio; 
  the solvency recovery (loss) ratio. 
  2. The current liquidity ratio shall characterize the 
overall 
availability of working capital to the enterprise for economic 
activity and for timely repayment of the enterprise's accrued 
liabilities. 
  The current liquidity ratio shall be defined as the ratio of 
the actual value of working capital in the possession of the 
enterprise in the form of production reserves, finished 
products, monetary resources, accounts receivable, and other 
working assets (the sum of the totals of sections II and III of 
balance sheet assets), to the shortest-term liabilities of the 
enterprise, taking the form of short-term bank credit, 
short-term loans, and various accounts payable (the total of 
section II of balance sheet liabilities, less lines 500, 510, 
730, 735, 740). 
  3. The internal liquidity ratio shall characterize presence 
of the enterprise's own working capital necessary for its 
financial stability. 
  The internal liquidity ratio shall be defined as the ratio 
of 
the difference between the volumes of working capital sources 
(the total of section I of balance sheet liabilities) and the 
actual value of fixed capital and other fixed assets (the total 
of section I of balance sheet assets), to the actual value of 
fixed capital in the enterprise's possession in the form of 
production reserves, unfinished products, finished products, 
monetary resources, accounts receivable, and other working 
assets (the sum of the totals of sections II and III of balance 
sheet assets). 
  4. The solvency recovery (loss) ratio shall characterize the 
presence of a real possibility for the enterprise to recover or 
lose its solvency over the course of a certain period of time. 
  The solvency recovery (loss) ratio shall be defined as the 
ratio of the calculated current liquidity ratio to its 
ascertained value. The calculated current liquidity ratio shall 
be defined as the sum of the actual value of the current 
liquidity ratio at the end of the reporting period, and change 
in the value of this ratio between the end and the beginning of 
the reporting period, expressed in terms of the established 
period of solvency recovery (loss). 
  5. Fulfillment of one of the following conditions shall be 
grounds for recognizing the structure of the balance sheet of an 
enterprise to be unsatisfactory, and the enterprise to be 
insolvent: 
  the current liquidity ratio at the end of the reporting 
period is less than 2; 
  the internal liquidity ratio at the end of the reporting 
period is less than 0.1. 
  6. When grounds established in item 5 of this attachment for 
recognizing the structure of the balance sheet to be 
unsatisfactory exist, and if the solvency recovery (loss) ratio, 
determined on the basis of a solvency recovery period equal to 
six months and an ascertained current liquidity ratio equal to 
2, is a value greater than unity, the decision that a real 
possibility for the enterprise to recover its solvency exists 
may be made. 
  When grounds established in item 5 of this attachment for 
recognizing the structure of the balance sheet to be 
unsatisfactory are absent, and if the solvency recovery (loss) 
ratio, determined on the basis of a solvency loss period equal 
to three months and an ascertained current liquidity ratio equal 
to 2, is a value less than unity, the decision that the 
enterprise will not be able to meet its obligations to creditors 
(a decision that the enterprise has lost its solvency) may be 
made. 
  7. A decision recognizing the structure of the balance sheet 
to be unsatisfactory based on grounds established by item 5 of 
this attachment may be postponed for a time determined by the 
Federal Administration for Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Affairs under 
the Russian State Committee for the Administration of State 
Property, if presence of a real possibility for the enterprise 
to recover its solvency has been established by the procedure 
determined by paragraph 1, item 6 of this attachment. 
  8. The balance sheet of an enterprise shall be analyzed on 
the basis of: 
  the balance sheet for the last reporting period, and the 
balance sheet as of the first of the current month (if the date 
on which this balance sheet is filled out does not coincide with 
the last day of the last accounting period), submitted by the 
enterprise management and notarized according to the established 
procedure; 
  the enterprise's balance sheet for the last reporting 
period, 
submitted to tax authorities in the case of failure of the 
enterprise management to submit the corresponding documents by 
the deadline. 
  Information contained in documents received according to the 
indicated procedure shall be sufficient to make a decision 
regarding determination of the unsatisfactoriness of the 
structure of an enterprise's balance sheet.

"Draft Budget `Clearly Not Within Russia's Powers' Institute of 
Economics of Problems of the Transition Period Experts Assert 
That Expenditures Require Revenues"] 
  [Text] While State Duma deputies are discussing the draft 
of the state budget for 1994, its deficit continues its usual 
threatening tendency to rise. "And we do not see a tendency 
toward reduction of state expenditures, which is clearly not 
within Russia's power," stated the deputy director of the 
Institute of Economics of Problems of the Transition Period 
[IEPTP], Sergey Sinelnikov, at an international conference 
organized by the IEPTP. 
  Thus, while in 1993, according to the institute's estimates, 
the deficit amounted to 10 percent of the GNP, during the first 
quarter of this year, it was 11 percent. And the budget 
continues to be in debt to a number of spheres and branches of 
the economy. In turn, this debt returns like a boomerang as 
nonpayments from enterprises not only to one another and the 
banks but also to the budget itself. The real amount of the 
value-added tax is decreasing. Taxes are devalued by inflation, 
which was conditioned, in the words of IEPTP Director Yegor 
Gaydar, by the 8-percent growth of the money supply in April. In 
the future, because of the issuance of money, inflation is 
expected to be at a monthly level of 12-15 percent. In such 
conditions, the resolve of the Central Bank to normalize the 
credit sphere by reducing the rate for refinancing, which in 
recent weeks has decreased by 5 percent, remains only a good 
intention. Rejection of the policy of monetarism, in the opinion 
of IEPTP specialists promises nothing good. In the opinion of 
institute experts, if the government had paid of state debts, 
the budget deficit would have been twice as great at the end of 
1993 and would have reached 20-22 percent of the GNP. But, 
covering it with credit emission from the Central Bank would 
only exacerbate inflation, which in any case is apparently 
approaching the limit of social tolerance. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin's government, participants in the 
conference noted, during the first quarter did not refrain from 
decisions that generated further expectations of inflation. 
Fulfilling the commitments made by the cabinet for last year 
alone would require funds in the amount of 1.5 times the GNP. 
Obviously, this cannot be done merely by increasing the revenue 
side of the budget. But, there has been a clear tendency toward 
its reduction since last summer. Thus, while in 1992 the 
revenues amounted to about 16 percent of the GNP and, during the 
first half of 1993, 13 percent, in the second half it was only 7 
percent. The average annual volume of budget revenues thus 
amounted to 10 percent and, taking into account centralized 
exports, 13-14 percent of the GNP. During the first quarter of 
this year, this indicator dropped to 8.1 percent and for the 
past four months, to 7.1 percent. The reduction of revenues is 
exacerbated by the decline of prices on the world market for 
oil, aluminum, and other exported kinds of raw material and 
products. The 1994 draft budget envisions incomes of 16.5-16.7 
percent of the GNP. But, in the opinion of IEPTP experts, one 
can realistically count on only 9-11 percent. 
  At the same time, the planned budget expenditures remain at 
last year's level, 25 percent of the GNP. Groups representing 
the interests of the military-industrial complex, the coal 
miners, the agrarians, and others are lobbying in the State Duma 
for increasing budget expenditures. Under their pressure it is 
possible to keep the budget deficit within reasonable limits 
only by reducing other expenditure items--on the social sphere, 
science, education, and public health. 
  In the investment policy, in the opinion of IEPTP 
specialists, it is necessary to take a selective approach. 
Today, when 5,000 out of 22,000 large enterprises are standing 
idle, 58 percent of the capacities of industry are operating at 
a loss and are not eligible for investment support. Investments 
are actually needed for structural rearrangement of the economy. 
But the financial resources are not adequate for that either. 
Gaydar experts think that there is reason to hope for help from 
abroad, in particular since during the next few days in Moscow 
there will be negotiations between the Central Bank of Russia 
and the Ministry of Finance and the IMF mission concerning 
Russia's receiving $4 billion in credits this autumn. As was 
reported at the international conference in the IEPTP, a meeting 
of the government presidium regarding the creation of a 
consultative council on foreign investment under the prime 
minister is earmarked for the beginning of June. It is 
anticipated that it will meet twice a year--alternately in 
Moscow and London.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Grigoryev: "The Central Bank Will Be Selling </F>
Curerency Only at the Exchanges" 
  [Text] 
<H5>  No institutional changes anticipated on the currency market </H5>
  As reported by the Interfax agency, with reference to Igor 
Knyazev, deputy director of the Department of Currency 
Operations of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, in the 
immediate future the Central Bank "does not intend changing the 
tactics of regulating the ruble exchange rate and plans to carry 
out secret intervention through networks of authorized banks." 
According to Mr. Knyazev in May the Central Bank had already 
completed several direct transactions in the sale of foreign 
currency to commercial banks. That is, the Central Bank carried 
out currency transactions, bypassing all of the Russian 
exchanges, on the basis of a bilateral agreement with commercial 
banks. 
  In general, the start of operations by the Central Bank in 
the sector outside the exchanges evidences recognition by it of 
serious changes in the institutional structure of the entire 
currency market. In principle the concentration of the largest 
share of currency transactions on one (or several) exchange 
floors is characteristic of an insufficiently developed and a 
highly centralized financial system dominated by vertical ties. 
That was exactly the situation in Russia in the past (and still 
is for the most part). Therefore the conduct of currency 
conversion operations, ceasing to be the prerogative of state 
banks, because of necessity needed an organizationally 
formulated mechanism. The Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, 
organized by the Central Bank and commercial banks became such a 
mechanism (by the end of 1993 its turnover exceeded 80 percent 
of the total Russian market) along with five more regional 
currency exchanges established later. 
  Until recently the development of the financial 
infrastructure was reflected in quantitative parameters--a 
decrease in the cost of business on a consignment basis, evening 
out of cash and non-cash exchange rates. In March of this year 
the currency market in the capital was subjected to a peculiar 
fiscal racket by the Moscow government. One year ago a rise in 
the cost of conversion operations by 0.1 percent would have been 
received by the banks, even if without pleasure, at least 
without serious reciprocal measures. At present, however, all of 
the main participants of trading on the exchange shifted to 
direct interbank transactions, limiting their activity at the 
exchange to mandatory sale of proceeds of their clients from 
exports. The volume of transactions in the dollar section of the 
MMVB [Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange] decreased by one half. 
  The slow, smooth, and predictable change in the ruble rate 
promoted the withdrawal of many banks from the exchange. The 
point is that during periods marked by a swift drop of the ruble 
the Central Bank appeared as the only seller of currency, which 
meant that it was possible to purchase it under "run from the 
ruble" conditions only on the exchange. At present, however, the 
market is not experiencing a need for large-scale currency 
intervention by the Central Bank. Moreover, periodically the 
rate in transactions outside of the exchange proved to be below 
the MMVB rate. By the way, it is highly likely that the steady 
increase of initial demand over supply on the exchange in the 
course of May is the consequence of skillful manipulation with 
bids by the Central Bank. After all correspondence of the 
dynamics of the exchange rate to the inflation rate is a 
strategic task of the Central Bank and for its achievement the 
Central Bank may consciously and systematically lower the rate 
through intervention on the exchange. 
  In that manner the Central Bank suddenly encountered an 
important tendency--the shifting of the center of currency 
operations to the interbank market outside the exchange. This 
presupposes two important conclusions: the result of exchange 
trading, remaining adequately representative, no longer fully 
reflects the market correlation of the ruble and the dollar, 
which means that the mechanism allowing the Central Bank to 
regulate it grows weaker. That line of reasoning explains the 
announcement by Mr. Knyazev to the effect that the Central Bank 
intends to initiate active operations on the interbank market. 
  Naturally, in order to realize that idea it will be 
necessary 
to form a limited circle of authorized banks. There are two 
possible variants of interaction between the Central Bank and 
commercial banks. The bureaucratic selection of candidates on 
the basis of subjective criteria (which is indirectly evidenced 
by the term "authorized banks" itself) creates a rigid structure 
in which commercial banks will be given the role of agents, or 
more precisely, brokers of the Central Bank fulfilling its 
instructions. In this case the Central Bank will retain a 
monopolistic position on the currency market. If financial 
indices should become a condition for inclusion in this list 
then in essence a market of large operators will form with the 
Central Bank becoming their dealing center. At the same time the 
Central Bank and commercial banks will become almost equal 
partners, while rates in transactions will reflect the state of 
the national currency in the most objective manner possible. 
  Today, however, neither variant is being studied by the 
leadership of the Central Bank. As reported by Aleksandr 
Potemkin, director of the Main Currency Administration of the 
Central Bank, his agency does not see the need for any changes 
in the mechanism of the currency market. All currency 
interventions by the Central Bank are carried out and will 
continue to be carried out through the currency exchanges. As 
far as bilateral transactions with commercial banks are 
concerned, the Central Bank only purchases currency, and only 
the export proceeds subject to mandatory sale. The thing is that 
with its sufficiently large volumes it is sometimes difficult 
for the banks to fulfill client instructions by deadlines 
stipulated by legislation. In such a case the Central Bank helps 
with the fulfillment of its own instructions at the same time 
guarding the exchange from a sharp surplus of currency and 
sudden changes in the exchange rate. (According to Mr. Potemkin, 
the volume of transactions was not less than $15 million and the 
exchange rate could have been even worse than the market rate.) 
  With the current inflation and level of monopolization of 
the 
banking system, according to Alkesandr Potemkin, it appears to 
be impossible to organize a liquid interbank market. If the 
system of currency exchanges provides access to the currency 
being sold by the Central Bank for almost 300 banks, whereas on 
the market outside of the exchange the Central Bank will be able 
to interact with 20-30 banks. That is why with continuation of a 
sufficiently high rate of inflation transition to a direct 
interbank currency market is premature. Any sharp change in the 
financial situation will lead to a drop in its liquidity and 
even to the curtailment of transactions. Banks which have access 
to currency will begin holding on to funds purchased from the 
Central Bank disturbing the market with speculative games. 
Intervention by the Central Bank through authorized banks will 
in that manner be transformed into an administrative 
distribution of currency resources.

"BAM: Life as a Loan"] 
  [Text] Can one be a destitute billionaire? It turns out 
that one can. Last year the Baykal-Amur railroad received about 
40 billion rubles in profit and has not been able to pay even 
half of its taxes because of... a lack of funds. Where has the 
money gone? 
  In general, was there any? Part of the profit, strange as it 
may seem, existed only on paper--in financial reports and 
accounts. The fact is that the railroad was in debt. Instead of 
settlements the senders of freight gave promises but put off 
fulfilling them and by the middle of January they had owed R30.8 
billion already, of which R25 billion was by the Yakutugol 
Production Association alone. And there was almost no hope that 
the debts would be recovered. In January, it is true, one 
managed to get R12 billion from the coal-miners. But in March 
the railroad people were forced to suspend the shipment of 
export coal for 20 days in order to make Yakutugol cough up the 
money. Then a meeting, God knows how many in succession there 
have been, of the related enterprises took place and the leaders 
of the association signed the usual pledge that the moment "they 
unfreeze" a million dollars for them in Vneshekonombank they 
will settle up with the railroad then and there. However they 
have not kept the promise. And subsequently they have positively 
announced that they will not pay last year's debts. They say, 
let the railroad recover them from the Russian government, which 
has not settled accounts with the coal-miners for deliveries of 
fuel to the national economy. 
  What's to be done? To again stop the shipment of coal? But 
no 
one will get more money from this. What is to be done with the 
improper clients who don't want to pay for shipments? The 
simplest thing, of course, is to refuse to do business with 
them. But where to get others? There are only two types of local 
freight on the BAM--coal and timber. There's no choice, but one 
also cannot accept the existing state of affairs. The railroad 
people are not so rich as to grant credit to the coal industry 
free of charge. 
  Attempts were made from the top to break the vicious circle 
of non-payments. A critical situation had developed in the power 
system of the Far East in December of last year. With a daily 
requirement of 85,000 tons of coal, the electric power stations 
were receiving almost two times less. 
  And money was found right away. Preferential loans were 
issued, and the heads of administration were ordered to pay for 
fuel and electric power first of all. Its consumers have begun 
to pay the railroads for the shipment of coal. BAM has received 
its share from Khabarovskenergo--R5 billion. 
  However, the cold weather has passed and, probably, it's no 
use to count on new financial infusions before next winter. 
Meanwhile Khabarovsk Kray alone has owed the coal-miners of 
South Yakutia R16 billion (of which half is to BAM for 
transportation). 
  Having realized that they won't get this money, the 
coal-miners have applied for help to the government of the Sakha 
Republic (Yakutia) and it has warned the administration of 
Khabarovsk Kray that, in view of the non-payments, it is 
discontinuing the shipment of coal beginning 1 June. But, you 
see, if one doesn't stockpile fuel in the summer misfortune 
awaits in the winter. It's no laughing matter to freeze enormous 
Khabarovsk! The kray authorities are now in a panic. They have 
appealed to the government of Russia for help, but if they do 
help, will the next multi-billion injection be enough for the 
long haul? 
  The meaning of the recommendations of the December collegium 
of the Ministry of Railways boiled down to the well-known 
formula: the rescuing of the drowning is the concern of the arms 
of the drowning themselves. But how is one to be saved if the 
impoverished related enterprises are dragged to the bottom? 
Moreover, BAM is the easiest to "sink": it has another heavy 
stone around its neck--social-cultural and everyday services. 
  So it has now developed that not the local authorities but 
the railroad people have become the bosses on the more than 
3,000 kilometer route. They support everything 
themselves--housing, hospitals, schools, kindergartens, cultural 
institutions. And such costly structures as boiler houses with 
heating systems besides. Last year some R14 billion were spent 
for the maintenance of housing and municipal services. Plus a 
half billion for the maintenance of clubs. Add to this help to 
departmental public health services and public education in the 
form of price discounts for heat, water, and electric power. And 
this also cost a good deal--on the order of R5 billion. In 
short, more than 16 percent of the profit has gone for "the 
administrative baggage train." Is this a lot or a little? 
Suffice it to say that it is the monthly wage of the entire 
railroad collective. 
  What is more, the railroad itself is unfinished. And, 
despite 
the pertinent edicts of the president and decrees of the 
government, construction is being wretchedly financed. As of 
today the government has owed R44 billion for work performed on 
BAM's title list. Of which R10 billion is for last year. Like it 
or not, the road has had to invest its own funds. About R2 
billion has gone just for preparing the main boiler house of the 
city of Tynda, where an additional boiler has been installed, 
for the winter. If the money had not been given the installation 
would have been disrupted and BAM's capital could have been left 
without heat in 50 degrees of frost. Will the money spent be 
recovered? Hardly. 
  There are even greater losses. Last year the road failed to 
receive about R70 billion of the financing quota allotted to it 
by the ministry. More than half of it was money which other 
roads should have given. Consider it lost! And if there would 
have been these billions BAM would have paid wages to its 
workers on time and settled up for fuel and rolling stock 
repair. Tens of cars today stand repaired at the plants--there's 
nothing to redeem them with. 
  The Baykal-Amur can become completely bankrupt. This has not 
happened as yet. Revenues from transport operations last year 
have amounted to R225.6 billion, which is almost R20 billion 
higher than the plan. Operating costs have been cut by R14.5 
billion. A profit from subsidiary and auxiliary operations more 
than five and a half times greater than planned has been 
received. And almost a billion more has been earned from the 
sale of goods and services. 
  However, as we already know, a part of these billions has 
remained on paper. But then taxes have been charged to the full 
extent: R23 billion to the territorial and local budgets. 
However, the railroad has paid only 10 and 13 has remained due. 
It would have been fair to divide revenues into real and "paper" 
and to take the tax from the real revenues. But, probably, this 
doesn't suit the authorities: it is easier to speak with the 
debtors. Incidentally, the railroad will pay a penalty of 
several billions for not paying taxes on time. 
  And apart from the main tax, so to speak, there are a great 
many petty ones. For example, until recently the local 
authorities have exacted a tax for the maintenance of the 
housing fund. A nice thing for a smart operator: to exact a tax 
for housing from the railroad people who maintain it themselves! 
But one had to endure an entire "war" until they temporarily 
removed this tax. Take again the transportation tax (1 percent 
of the wage fund). Also a considerable amount of money, even 
though it would have to be paid, the wrong way round, in 
addition. Last year suburban transport operations yielded losses 
of almost a half million. On many roads these losses are 
partially cleared off from the local budget. Here the 
authorities don't do that despite all the appeals of the 
railroad's management. They say: you haul your own railroad 
people--there are no other passengers here. 
  The railroad for some reason pays for everything: 
maintenance 
of municipal militia, civic improvements, for property and for 
land. The one tax on highways alone has lightened its pocket 
last year by R2 billion. That's just robbery! 
  BAM passes through the territories of two national 
republics, 
several krays and oblasts and everywhere they have their own 
procedures. In one republic, for example, they tear off a 
further family and municipal tax. Well, okay, if for this money 
the local authorities would take on themselves at least part of 
the responsibilities. No such thing. Practically the entire 
survival of the enormous route is on the shoulders of the road 
itself. In 1993 it incurred more than R2 billion in losses from 
the operation of workers' supply departments at line stations. 
One can close the stores and get rid of these expenditures but 
then the employees of small stations will have nowhere even to 
buy bread. 
  This problem doesn't trouble the municipalities and the 
municipal councils much. Just as also the fate of the doctors 
and teachers working in departmental hospitals and schools who 
haven't received their wages for several months. They should be 
financed from the federal budget. However, last year only 30 
percent of the funds needed were allocated. The railroad has 
again paid the debts of the state. 
  Is it up to carrying such enormous expenditures? True, it 
coped up till now. However, now the situation has changed. The 
volumes of transport operations have fallen. During the first 
quarter the shipment of freight has come to 88.5 percent of last 
year's level and freight turnover--89.9 percent. With such 
indicators, of course, it's not worth waiting for last year's 
revenues. And if one also further considers the chronic 
inability to pay of the clients, whose debts are growing day by 
day, then a "trap" threatens the road from which it can't get 
out. 
  The management is doing everything possible. It has appealed 
with letters and held talks with the heads of oblast 
administrations and with the governments of the republics about 
the reduction of local taxes and subsidization of the social 
sphere in connection with the difficult financial situation in 
which BAM finds itself today. You can't imagine the humiliating 
situation: the railroad giant begs for help! And the results 
don't give too much hope--the authorities also plead the lack of 
funds. 
  Where is the money if the authorities don't have it? The 
impression is that nowadays nobody pays anybody anything. During 
the first quarter the railroad has an income from transport 
operations of R211.5 bilion, but has received only R118.3 
billion in "live" money all told. It has not been able to 
collect a whole R35 billion from debtors and its own ministry 
has undersupplied the rest. There they say: you demand the debts 
from the clients better! But how to demand if they are bankrupts 
almost. We have already begun to take their products on the 
debt's account. Last year we took from the timber cutters and 
sold more than a thousand cars of timber (70,000 cubic meters). 
We exchanged it for fuel, materials, spare parts, and consumer 
goods. We have received more than 30,000 tons of coal from the 
coal-miners and shipped it for export. 
  Such a form of operation is being effectively utilized this 
year as well. Contracts regarding coal and timber have been 
concluded with foreign firms and the near abroad. But the fact 
is that this posture will not save everyone. Barter will hardly 
help one to carry out summer track work and prepare the 
railroad's system for the winter. "Live" money is needed here 
and there is none. The crumbs that fall from time to time go 
entirely for wages. The road is living on credit; moreover, its 
debts have already exceeded R40 billion. Can one really live 
this way? 
  No, BAM won't be able to manage without state support, 
without the help of the ministry. Two simple figures convince 
one of this: the volume of transport operations and of freight 
turnover here are half that on any neighboring mainline but the 
production cost is three times higher. The railroad is expensive 
but give it a normal workload and it will pay for itself. 
  The BAM people are not to blame for the fact that the 
construction of the mainline has far outstripped the development 
of the region. They are even trying to force it somehow. Thus, 
the Baykal-Amur has become a stock-holder of the Amurtitan firm, 
which has begun the development of a major deposit of ores. This 
will yield a freight flow and good dividends for the capital 
invested. Moreover, the railroad people are participating on 
shares in the development of a coal deposit in South Yakutia 
with the production and sale of 150,000 tonnes this year and 
300,000 tonnes each starting next year. The work for the 
"wheels" will be not bad. 
  There are also other enterprises of which the railroad is 
the 
co-founder, thereby creating clientele for itself. The prospects 
here are great, for BAM's territory represents four Frances and 
there are sufficient mineral resources here. But, unfortunately, 
in the present situation of lack of money all these riches are 
"dead capital": "there's many a slip 'twixt cup and lip." 
  State protectionism is needed, of course, as is accepted in 
all civilized countries with respect to northern territories or 
territories under development. The state should reduce or 
altogether exempt a new construction railroad from the tax 
burden for a time and provide preferential loans--to give the 
giant an opportunity to survive and to stand on its own feet, in 
order to assure itself "growth" in the future. And this 
certainly needs to be taken into account in the new long-term 
state program for the development of the eastern regions of 
Russia which is now being developed in the government. Without 
this any, even the most sensible, program will prove to be only 
"a straw in the hands of a drowning man."

<F P=106> [Article by V. Chibisov: "Economics in the Center of </F>
Attention"] 
  [Text] The principle by which executive personnel are 
judged is their knowledge of the sector's economics, their 
ability to control them and thus ensure a stable financial state 
for their collective and sector. Such was perhaps the leitmotif 
of the sorters' conference conducted yesterday by Minister of 
Railways G. Fadeyev. The results of 5 months' work of railroad 
transportation were summarized, and the tasks to be completed in 
the first half-year were defined. 
  But before analyzing the state of affairs in the sector, the 
minister gave a briefing on the position of the Russian economy 
as a whole. Production volume continues to fall. The output of 
industrial products dropped below 55 percent. On this backdrop 
the proportion of consumption expenses is increasing, and the 
quantity of accumulated fixed capital and working capital is 
decreasing. In April almost 5,000 enterprises were partially or 
completely idle. 
  In this situation it was no accident that the RF president 
recently published edicts on the most acute problems of economic 
reform. The edicts have the greatest significance to 
transportation, because the sector's economic position depends 
on the state of the Russian economy as a whole. The strategy of 
transportation activities adopted in December at an expanded 
meeting of the board of the Ministry of Railways was adjusted in 
the direction of tighter controls, and it is now producing 
positive results. While shipments were carried out at a loss in 
the first quarter, now the situation is changing. The profit 
from shipments in April was 287 billion rubles, which made it 
possible to cover the losses for January-March, and in general 
for 4 months. A possibility for counting on profitable work 
appeared. In 5 months, income was almost R7.8 trillion, 
including 7 trillion from freight shipments. And operating 
expenses were R6.9 trillion. Profit received from shipments made 
it possible to raise profitability from 3.4 percent 
(January-April) to 12 in 5 months, and to maintain the wage 
level in accordance with the Tariff Agreement. Here is the 
situation in terms of wages: While wages grew by 16.7 percent in 
the national economy as a whole in 3 months, coming to R164,800 
in March, in railroad transportation wages increased by 29 
percent, coming to R280,000 in March (fifth place among the 
economy's leading sectors), and the figure anticipated for May 
is R323,000. 
  But this increment is tangible only when it gets into the 
hands of the workers themselves in a timely manner. This is 
where things aren't going so well. Some railroads were late in 
paying wages. I recently spoke with mechanics at the Rtishchevo 
Locomotive Depot. "We're living on credit," they said. "When you 
get your paycheck, you pay off your debts and then go back to 
living on credit. And the only wages we've gotten are those for 
March." Locomotive crews of the Kochetovka Depot complained of 
the same thing. 
  The Ministry of Railways planned to reach a normal level of 
wage payment in the first half-year. The first deadline of the 
railroads for paying off their debt to the workers was 20 May. 
Unfortunately nine railroads, to include the North Caucasus, 
Southeastern, Transbaykal and others, failed to reach the goal. 
Some of them couldn't even find financing sources, at the same 
time that their accounts payable are growing. This means that 
debts are not being collected fully from clients. 
  Economization of operating expenses continues to be a sore 
point. Eight hundred eighty-five electric locomotives and 841 
diesel locomotives are being maintained on the railroads in 
excess of the norms. Their maintenance alone has required 
expenditure of R58 billion. The condition of the locomotive 
fleet is low, especially in the South Urals, Krasnoyarsk and 
Transbaykal railroads. Unplanned locomotive repairs "swallowed 
up" 80 percent of all nonproductive expenditures in the 5 
months. Losses have been suffered in railcar management. The 
railcars of passenger trains are a third empty, but trains are 
still being formed in the same old way. There are sharp 
contrasts in the cost of a ride on commuter trains. Travel 
through one zone requires payment of R270 on the Far Eastern 
Railroad, 200 on the Kemerovo Railroad, 200 on the October 
Railroad, 160 on the Northern and South Urals railroads, 50 on 
the Moscow, Volga and Southeastern railroads, and R40 on the 
Sverdlovsk and Transbaykal railroads. In the meantime the 
expenses continue to pile up. 
  The problems of expediting freight and of tariff policy, 
progress in fulfilling the Tariff Agreement, selection of 
executive personnel, train traffic safety and other issues were 
analyzed in detail at the conference.
