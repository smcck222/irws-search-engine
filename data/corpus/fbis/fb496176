<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Delyagin, economist: "The Banking System </F>
of Russia: The Commanding Heights Have Been Secured"] 
  [Text] For more than a year now information analysis 
agencies have been publishing lists of the 100 largest banks of 
Russia, grouping them according to various indicators. Slowness 
in the processing of the information has resulted in the fact 
that the data as of 1 January 1994 (with the final turnovers, 
which is fundamentally important) have become known only 
recently. Analysis of the state of affairs of the banks of the 
"first 100" and of the "first 20" has allowed economist MIKHAIL 
DELYAGIN to draw a number of interesting conclusions: about the 
reduction of the concentration of assets in the largest banks 
(which means a growth of competition in the banking sector), 
about the continuing rise of Moscow as a financial center and 
about the rearrangements in the upper echelons of the banking 
community, the esence of which is in the relative weakening of 
the "whales" among the former specialized banks and the rise of 
young "tigers" based on trading and financial-industrial 
groups. 
  The first thing that needs to be noted is that all the 
ratings of commercial banks being published, regardless of the 
procedures being used, are rather arbitrary. Moreover, because 
of the unwillingness of a number of large banks to submit 
information about themselves all ratings are incomplete. One can 
somewhat reduce the indeterminacy that occurs in the process, in 
our opinion, by examining only the very top of the banking 
"pyramid"--the very large general-purpose banks which already 
have gained considerable weight. According to the latest data, 
the dividing line of this "top" can, again with a certain amount 
of arbitrariness, be drawn under the first 20 banks, the assets 
of which have exceeded the half a trillion ruble boundary. The 
probability that any of them suddenly "will sink into 
insignificantness" is small: these banks are already able to not 
fear either a private nor a state criminal racket. That is why 
it makes good sense to consider the situation of the first 100 
and first 20 banks in parallel.

  Thus, the first thing that strikes one's eye is the 
reduction 
in the concentration of bank assets, an important indicator 
which is evidence of the scale of a commercial bank's 
operations. In practice this signifies a certain levelling-out 
of the forces of the commercial banks and the strengthening of 
competition. Thus, if on 1 January the 100 largest banks of 
Russia (not counting the largest bank--Vneshtorgbank RF [Russian 
Federation Foreign Trade Bank]) represented 5.8 percent of their 
total number and had 60.6 percent of the banking system's 
assets, then on 1 July the indicators mentioned came to 5.4 
percent and 71 percent respectively, and on 1 January 1994--4.95 
percent and about 56 percent (in the last two cases--already 
taking the Russian Federation Foreign Trade Bank into account). 
  The tendency towards a decline in the level of concentration 
of bank assets for the first 20 banks is even more noticeable: 
as of 1 January 1993 their number and assets came to 1.2 and 
40.3 percent of the total amount respectively (not counting the 
Foreign Trade Bank), as of July--1.1 and 63 percent, and as of 1 
January 1994--1.0 and 38 percent. 
  However, as the quantitative concentration has decreased, a 
regional concentration is occurring, primarily around Moscow. 
Some 38 Moscow banks were among the first 100 as of 1 January 
1993, including 13 in the first 20. As of 1 July the "Moscow 
presence" had increased to 39 and 16 respectively. As of 1 
January 1994 Moscow banks represented almost half of Russia's 
largest banks (47) and completely made up "the upper 20" by 
themselves. There are no financial centers in Russia comparable 
to Moscow. The greatest number of banks that have been part of 
the "upper 100" from other cities--three each--are registered in 
Saint Petersburg, Ufa, Chelyabinsk and Krasnodar. Ufa should be 
especially noted. Based on certain characteristics Bashkortostan 
is becoming one of the most dynamic and attractive centers of 
Russia. It is altogether not without reason that the Union of 
Swiss Banks has chosen precisely it for the setting-up and 
practical realization of a clearing system of mutual settlements 
based on the most up-to-date technologies. 
  The table cited briefly illustrates the recent past of these 
banks. The Rossiyskiy kredit bank, which has climbed from 63rd 
to eighth place in the bank table of rank during the year, has 
achieved the most rapid take-off. Its leadership realized almost 
before all the rest the strategic advantages of a large charter 
fund and concentrated its efforts on increasing the latter even 
prior to the introduction of the open currency position, when 
this was at variance with its current business interests. 
Most-bank, which jumped from 77th place to 19th in six months, 
is close to repeating Rossiyskiy kredit's "record." This bank's 
success is to be explained in many respects by its support by a 
powerful financial-industrial group. 
  By and large precisely the banks created by large 
financial-industrial or trading structures were the most dynamic 
in 1993. Apart from Most-bank their number includes Alfa-bank, 
which has stepped right away from beyond the limits of the first 
100 to 26th place, Neftekhimbank, Avtobank, and, certainly, 
Natsionalnyy kredit bank. 
  The undoubted success of Sberbank (Savings Bank) should also 
be noted. The share of the population's deposits in Sberbank has 
dropped by a third during the past year--from 90 to 60 percent 
of their total volume--but the bank has been able not only to 
compensate for the losses incurred but also to strengthen its 
position--apparently through the activization of directions of 
activity that are not traditional for it, primarily the 
expansion of currency operations and operations on the 
inter-bank loans market. 
  Such large and well-known banks as Inkombank and MENATEP are 
moving steadily upwards. However, reputation bears fruit only in 
combination with aggressive marketing. Otherwise, the fate of 
recent leaders, which are slowly but steadily being pushed 
aside, would have befallen these banks. The latter include 
Agroprombank, Mosbiznesbank, TOKObank, Moskovskiy industrialnyy 
bank (MIB), Kredobank and Unikombank, not to mention those which 
have vacated the "top 20," among which Elektrobank, which has 
slipped from 11th place to 23rd in 1993, as well as Agroprombank 
from Rostov-on-Don and Chelindbank, especially stood out. At the 
same time it is for now too early to say that the trend towards 
the relative weakening of the former specialized banks being 
observed in the "first 20" is also true for the Russian 
provinces.

<F P=106> [Article by I. Zasurskiy: "Gaydar Was Right--and </F>
Chernomyrdin Also"] 
  [Text] In the opinion of Vladimir Shcherbakov, the 
first six edicts are not sufficient to evaluate how 
comprehensively the president approaches economic reform. 
  Vladimir Shcherbakov, president of the Interprivatizatsiya 
fund, expressing his views on the presidential decrees, 
commented that the first six indicate movement in the right 
direction, while the return of two drafts for additional 
elaboration out of eight that were prepared provides grounds for 
evaluating the approach to economic reform as a weighed and 
thoughtful process. It is still too early to speak about how 
comprehensive they are, as it is necessary to see if only the 
drafts of the others, of which, as is commonly known, over 100 
are currently in preparation. 
  A selective state industrial policy is fundamental to the 
former deputy prime minister of the USSR. Emphasis must be 
placed on it, and not on the accelerated bankruptcy of 
enterprises. The legislative base for bankruptcy is undoubtedly 
necessary. Bankruptcy was and will continue to be a routine 
phenomenon in a market economy. The question is what type of 
policy will be implemented--one with additional limitation of 
the money supply, which will generate massive bankruptcies of 
enterprises in a difficult financial position, or with 
stimulation of individual types of production and enterprises as 
well as selection of producers in the interest of preserving the 
domestic economy and the life of the people. 
  A grasp of the essence of what constitutes a selective 
policy 
is highly important. 
  The elaboration of such a policy must afford us the 
possibility of differentiating not individual enterprises, but 
groups of them, perhaps types of production, those that we need 
and without which we simply cannot survive--in this case I do 
not have in mind preferential credits for individual 
enterprises. We must not have a situation where the appropriate 
government commission would decide which plant is to get what 
amount of money. That commission has another task: formulation 
of the goal, tasks, selection criteria, determination of forms 
and methods of stimulation, and control to ensure that the money 
is not spent on wages but on organization of production, 
purchase of materials, and the like. At present, however, in the 
view of the former deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers 
of the USSR, such a policy has not been worked out, and money is 
being received by lobbyists blackmailing the government with 
strikes. Shcherbakov asserts: "The government cannot be blamed 
for the fact that some are able to twist its arm until it 
crunches, it is only possible to sympathize with it, however it 
is necessary not to succumb to blackmail. At one time," 
Shcherbakov continues, "we were unable to hold out: Having given 
in to the miners, we were compelled to give in to others as 
well. The consequences of that for the economy are well known." 
  How to conduct a selective policy? For instance, we pick a 
criterion--vitally important branches. Today that is not the 
entire Ministry of Railways, but only its enterprises involved 
directly with organization of traffic on the railroad. It is 
clear that without it we are nowhere. Then let us declare that 
it will be operating under special financial conditions. Let us 
grant it special-purpose credit at a reasonable interest rate, 
but not in order "to keep its pants up" and cover current 
expenditures, but for repairs, because if the old tracks used by 
trains disintegrate completely, there will be an entirely 
different situation developing in the country. It is the same 
with oil workers. Issue credit for repair of wells and 
pipelines, but not for wages. It is not very difficult to ensure 
that technically. 
  Today money turnover in production equals about 100 days. 
This means that practically all enterprises are insolvent. Money 
is the lifeblood of production. That is, if the policy of 
limiting the money supply is to be continued with a rise in 
inflation, Vladimir Shcherbakov believes that would be a 
situation where blood was drained from everyone, one after the 
other--from those who are not needed in a market economy as well 
as from those who were forced to give their production for state 
needs but were not paid, and those without whom we will perish 
as a sovereign state and people. 
  By way of an example, even if an absurd one, for 
instance--who in the world would think of turning off 
electricity in a hospital? At the airport control tower? In our 
case, however, such cases are not that rare. 
  Simple solutions are deceptive. Neither bankruptcies nor 
promissory notes are a panacea for the problems faced by the 
Russian economy. That is, promissory notes can and must promote 
the resolution of certain tasks with an appropriate legislative 
support. Just as bankruptcies are important so that enterprises 
know what may happen to them. But a policy prodding toward 
bankruptcy is highly unpromising. It is dangerous both in the 
economic and in the political regard. That is a very heavy 
social scene in the revival of the economy. It is impossible to 
get by without that, but it is important not to agitate for the 
conduct of such policy. If matters develop in the way on which 
certain members of the government are insisting, then no 
agreements will rescue us." 
  In the opinion of the former chairman of the State Planning 
Commission of the USSR, there is another aspect of the problem 
pertaining to the industrial crisis that can also be resolved 
only through comprehensive methods--that is, the problem of 
business in industry. "At present I do not know whether 
enterprises will ever give me the money or not, and if the state 
shares even with regard to a few branches, then I will know for 
certain that the pharmacists will give me the money. The railway 
workers also. Then I will invest in them and will organize 
production for them." 
  It is necessary to see the entire system of problems in all 
of its complexity. When Gaydar started with abrupt moves, he was 
correct, Shcherbakov believes, and when Chernomyrdin allowed 
everyone to adapt a little bit and regain their senses, he was 
also correct. 
  Is Livshits also correct? 
  I do not know who is the real author of the edicts. I can 
only note that until it becomes clear what edicts will follow 
the first six, it is impossible to tell whether their author is 
right.

<F P=106> [Interview with Doctor of Economic Sciences Aleksandr </F>
Yakovlevich Livshits, professor, director of a group of experts 
under the RF President, by Anatoliy Pokrovskiy; place and date 
not given: "Economy Cannot Be Built on Illusions"] 
  [Text] The editorial department introduced this 
column "A View From the Kremlin" in order to familiarize our 
readers at first hand, as people say, with different points of 
view of diverse events in Russia's troubled life. One can agree 
or disagree with the arguments expressed here. However, in order 
to argue with someone with good reasoning, one must first listen 
to him attentively. 
  The person with whom we are talking today is Doctor of 
Economic Sciences Aleksandr Yakovlevich Livshits, professor, 
director of a group of experts under the RF President. He 
graduated from the Institute of the National Economy imeni G.V. 
Plekhanov in the specialized field of economic cybernetics and 
worked at Moscow State Technological University. He defended his 
candidate dissertation in the department headed by academician 
L. Abalkin. He is the author of the first textbook in market 
economy in Russia. 
  [Pokrovskiy] Aleksandr Yakovlevich, recently, 
representatives 
of various parties and scientific schools and trends have 
published such a large number of economic theories, guesses, and 
forecasts that it looks as if so-called simple folk, business 
people, and foreign investors simply have lost their orientation 
in the ways of Russia's development. However, not long ago the 
RF President issued a whole package of edicts of an economic 
nature. Does this mean that, as physicists say, islands of 
stability, on the basis of which we can move toward an upsurge 
in Russia's economy, have finally been discovered? 
  [Livshits] I am one of the people who think that we have 
more 
than enough programs, if not other things. At least one of them 
should be fulfilled, instead of inventing new theoretical 
dreams. I will say right away that the government has a specific 
program and there is also the president's message. This is quite 
sufficient for the beginning of purposeful work. 
  I have a very firm impression that, with the exception of 
very extremist positions--for example, the state is weak, one 
cannot rely on it, it will lead us to the wrong place, let 
everything proceed by itself--there is a general understanding 
of what should be done. Please note: The president's message is 
devoted to the strengthening of the state. This is its main 
point. 
  And so, what is to be done? The idea is as follows: To 
maintain the saturation of the consumer market to the maximum 
possible degree at tolerable prices. Not to permit sharp jumps 
here, at the same time, shifting the center of gravity of 
reforms to production reform. Of what can we boast here? 
People's economic psychology, including that of boards of 
directors, has changed noticeably. Enterprise managers now think 
about demand, although some people, in the old way, try only to 
extract money from the budget. But a breakthrough did occur. 
There is voucher privatization and there are a number of other 
changes. 
  However, production reform is a long and difficult matter 
and 
we must deal with it step-by-step. In particular, let us examine 
the problem of prices. Here my personal point of view does not 
coincide in everything with my friends' opinion. During these 
years we have learned the ability to affect inflation rates, if 
nothing else. In principle, if the task of reducing inflation 
rates to 2 or 3 percent in 2 months is set, the government knows 
how to do this technically. However, Russia's industry and 
Russia's economy will not withstand the methods, by means of 
which it is possible to bring down inflation so sharply. 
  Yes, all of us want prices of goods not to rise, but this 
can 
be achieved only at too high a price. Therefore, I have taken 
the liberty of saying that there is a dangerously high 
inflation, but there is also a dangerously low inflation, which 
will immediately affect production development. 
  [Pokrovskiy] Very likely, this threatens to cause not only a 
decline in production, but also a rise in unemployment. 
  [Livshits] Yes, it is also necessary to significantly limit 
state expenditures. Yet many enterprises now live and work at 
their expense. If these expenditures are cut down completely, 
enterprises will not withstand this. For now such is our life, 
whether we like this or not. Therefore, the whole subtle point 
is to maintain the forecast moderate inflation and to direct all 
efforts toward production reform. One of the president's key 
edicts is devoted to reform of state enterprises. I assume that 
it will be followed by some other edicts. However, their meaning 
is one--to establish the rights of the state as an owner in a 
sector where state enterprises operate. In other words, to 
restore the manageability of enterprises belonging to the state 
itself. After all, it is obvious that such an enterprise belongs 
not to the director alone. It is common and cannot serve the 
interests of one person or groups of people. 
  [Pokrovskiy] Please excuse me, but then what is to be done 
with conversion into joint stock companies and privatization? 
  [Livshits] There is no contradiction here, because it is 
only 
a matter of "public" enterprises. The edict states this 
precisely: A decision on the establishment of a public plant can 
be made only with regard to an industrial or an agricultural 
federal state enterprise, the privatization of which is 
prohibited by the state program. And so, there can be no 
questions with the private sector. 
  I will even say more. I think that some time will pass and 
the word "nationalization" will cease to be abusive. There is no 
contradiction here and I am by no means an admirer of the 
planning system. I am simply for a flexible, pragmatic approach 
to economic development without any "taboos." In normal 
economies there is both privatization and temporary 
nationalization with subsequent reprivatization. The point is 
that in economic policy there is nothing absolutely harmful or 
absolutely useful. These qualities are determined only by 
expediency and extent. If during some period privatization is 
advantageous and useful for Russia, it should be carried out to 
the extent to which it is useful. If, however, nationalization 
is needed, this, too, should be done without thinking about some 
ideological lack of coordination. Such an approach to this 
matter dominates in the world with benefit for production. 
  I repeat: Everything in moderation. When one nationalizes 
everything and makes a single state machine, we all know that 
this ends sadly. However, it by no means follows from this that 
"nationalization" should be eliminated from the dictionary of 
the Russian language. 
  [Pokrovskiy] Then the meaning of the president's latest 
edicts is that all forms of ownership must be used? 
  [Livshits] It is more utilitarian and concrete. They have 
double meaning. First: To begin production reform. Second: 
Strengthening of financial discipline and introduction of order 
in payments and taxes. In this connection I want to say: There 
is nothing exotic in them. Now we have already received the 
first information on the reaction to them. 
  What is especially interesting here? No one accepts this 
fully, but no one fully rejects this either. This is good. Our 
president should be the president of all Russia--not communist, 
or democratic, or monarchic, or some other Russia. He would be 
able to find the common things that unite the maximum number of 
Russians. 
  Now we often hear from some people: Yes, this is correct, 
but 
I talked about this a year ago. From others: Yes, this is 
correct, but we talked about this 2 years ago. They finally have 
begun to act. And this is good, because this means: There is 
nothing extravagant, which no one expects, in the edicts. If 
this were vice versa--"we need this like snow on the head"--this 
would be harmful. And if they talked about this earlier, this 
means that the problem is urgent. 
  And another thing. Well, who does not want to introduce 
order 
in finances and to establish discipline in calculations? 
However, is it really normal that an enterprise is almost 
sinking and withholding workers' wages, at the same time, having 
currency funds in its account? Therefore, under certain 
conditions one of the president's edicts introduces an 
obligatory exchange of currency for rubles: Pay into the budget, 
pay wages. 
  However, why does the president in his edict have to force 
the owner to spend his funds on these purposes? This is strictly 
a phenomenon of the transitional period. Can you imagine such a 
thing in England? There, if an owner does not have pounds 
sterling, he calmly converts dollars and settles his account. It 
does not even occur to him to hold back payments. 
  I will explain: The president did not begin with edicts. 
There were negotiations, there was a message, and there was a 
memorandum on the most acute problem--nonpayments. It came to 
the government and to the State Duma. The government reacted 
quickly. An answer came from the State Duma: We approve 
everything. Well, what of that? For 1 and 1/2 months we waited 
for the Duma, from the approval, to turn to the necessary 
amendments to the law, which would make it possible to weaken 
the acuteness of nonpayments. In brief, there is no 
confrontation, but there is also no action. 
  I would say the following: When the president has to 
undertake such decisions, these are forced steps. After all, in 
principle, the economy should be regulated by statutes and by 
economic law. Of course, if clear-cut decisions had been adopted 
promptly, in accordance with the demands of life, these edicts 
would not have been needed. 
  [Pokrovskiy] However, who should adopt such decisions? 
  [Livshits] Of course, the Duma. The Duma, who else? It 
adopts 
laws. However, production cannot wait. We received data on 22 
days in May... The decline continues. How much can one wait? 
Therefore, it was very hard for me to receive the news from the 
Duma. I will tell you as the representative of PRAVDA that 
communists in the Duma came out against these edicts as 
anticonstitutional. However, did communists not propose that 
order and discipline be introduced? And if someone tries to do 
this, what is bad about this? 
  [Pokrovskiy] However, every party in its policy proceeds 
from 
its own principles, from its own programs... 
  [Livshits] To this I will answer that the time has come to 
free ourselves from some customary illusions. The first of 
them--the idea of the beneficial nature of constant prices. 
However, weather changes and over the years even a wife changes. 
Why should prices be constant? After all, the stiffness of 
prices fetters the market mechanism. The second--the need for a 
full loading of enterprise capacities. To many it seems that, 
previously, we worked in three shifts and now we have changed 
over to one--this is a disaster! I assure you that this is a 
normal situation. In all countries with a market economy there 
is even a specific index for the government--the level of 
loading of a production apparatus. For example, in the United 
States a loading of 75 to 80 percent is considered normal. A 
loading of 20 to 25 percent represents a frozen capacity in case 
of changes in demand. If there is a package of orders, it is put 
into operation. An economy, the capacities of which constantly 
operate 100 percent, is just as unnatural and unpleasant for 
life as a country in which there is always summer. 
  The main problem lies in reliably controlling the optimum 
degree of loading: Does the decline proceed in an uncontrolled 
manner? This is the problem for the government. 
  Finally, the third illusion, to part with which, probably, 
is 
most difficult. This is the illusion of full employment. It 
comes from 70 years of our life, when we believed that we got 
rid of unemployment--this ulcer of capitalism. However, the work 
place is not granted by God or by the state. It is a blessing 
that must be earned. 
  We will be fair. Under socialism there were also tens and 
sometimes even hundreds of thousands of people, who were 
dismissed, for example, from the Krasnyy Proletariy Plant and 
did not yet come to the Plant imeni Ordzhonikidze. Who were 
they? At that moment, the unemployed. 
  Such unemployment is not dangerous. The true danger lies not 
in the number of the unemployed, but in the length of 
unemployment for every given person. If he cannot find a new 
place for 1, 2, or 4 months, this is already a true human 
tragedy. And so, two things--lengthy unemployment and focal 
unemployment, mainly at our famous plant cities--cannot be 
allowed. These are the true and difficult problems on the 
employment market. 
  Whoever may say this to me, whatever they may frighten me 
with, I do not believe in mass unemployment in Russia. However, 
the threat of lengthy focal, regional unemployment is a real 
threat. The government understands this, but concrete measures 
are also needed; for example, for Ivanovo Oblast, where these 
phenomena are already very tangible. It is necessary to monitor 
and to prevent this danger in other regions as well. Here the 
state program should be put into effect automatically. As soon 
as unemployment is above the average level somewhere, it is 
necessary to put into effect incentives for the creation of work 
places. 
  Yes, we must part with the illusion of a complete 
elimination 
of unemployment, as difficult as this may be. And again I would 
like to turn to the position of the Communist Party. Those that 
are familiar with Lenin's works remember his work, which begins 
with the words: "The approaching disaster..." And so, often 
communists rightly talk a great deal about approaching 
disasters. But it seems that they forget the second half of 
Lenin's title: "...And How To Fight Against It." 
  I carefully read the constructive part of the communists' 
program. What is there? To ensure a normal standard of living... 
However, show me within these walls at least one person who 
would not want the same. But how to do this and from what 
resources? How to stimulate private owners and to establish a 
nonstate pension fund if the state does not have enough money 
for this and so forth? There are no answers to these questions. 
  At the same time, I want to say that the pendulum of 
political life in Russia moves, even if slowly, to the left, 
toward social-democracy. This is a known process. It is visible 
in many countries of the former socialist camp. This is a normal 
process. However, I am afraid: Did it not begin in our country 
rather too early? We do not yet have enough normal 
social-democracy, the one that could continue reforms if the 
voter gives it his votes. But in order to achieve social 
justice, it is necessary to accumulate what can be divided 
later. This cannot be done with our weak economy. 
  Let us observe, using Western Europe as an example, what 
happens when socialists come to power in a country. Everything 
begins with partial nationalization and measures to reduce 
unemployment, but very often ends with considerable inflation. 
Then conservatives come to power and begin to lower inflation, 
but unemployment rises again and again comes the time of 
socialists. Such an alternation is fully normal. 
  [Pokrovskiy] The need to strengthen the state and its 
regulating role is constantly seen in your remarks. Do I 
understand you correctly? 
  [Livshits] Yes, correctly. 
  [Pokrovskiy] Then what prevents this? Mass psychology, or 
the 
lack of a legislative base? 
  [Livshits] Most probably, the latter. I simply must say this 
to your readers. The tradition to hurl abuse at power has long 
existed in Russia--on the sly, so that someone does not make a 
report to the authorities anonymously or openly as now. However, 
please note: Russia does not strive to go anywhere, for example, 
to the "Karbovanets zone." But some try to get into the ruble 
zone and sometimes simply want to join us, which, in my view, 
would be dangerous. However, this is a separate topic. The point 
is that, if you come to near abroad with rubles, the ratio is as 
though you come with dollars. Here is the latest report from 
Ukraine: Auctions of rubles have been stopped, because the 
demand for them is 10-fold bigger than supply. 
  I say this not because everything is remarkable here. But 
scattering ashes on one's head is also going overboard. Russia 
was and remains a great power. And now, when such an attitude 
toward the ruble exists, it is by no means the last. 
  [Pokrovskiy] Nevertheless, dollars are leaving the country. 
Are people afraid to invest them? 
  [Livshits] They are. But we must analyze for what reasons. 
Let us assume that a firm engages in import operations. It needs 
currency to purchase goods abroad! Many such examples can be 
cited, but this does not mean at all that I fully want to 
justify the currency "flight." A lot of money is leaving the 
country legally and illegally. How to stop this? To close the 
border, or to take some other forceful measures? However, this 
is not the way out. There is one way out--to give motivation for 
the investment of currency in the country. 
  Today I have talked with bankers from a very rich bank. They 
say: Preparations are being made to let foreign banks into our 
country, but we are known to be weaker. How is that? I ask: You 
do not want this? We do not. Very good. However, all commercial 
people should realize: There must be an equal exchange. For 
example, we will not let foreign banks in here. But in return 
you put the vast amount of money that you made in trade and 
received on credit in investments. What else do you need? There 
is money, the political situation in the country is more or less 
stable, there are no fights for power, prices have already been 
rising moderately for 4 months, the situation can be predicted, 
there are vacant capacities, and plants do not have to be built 
from the foundation. What prevents you from investing funds in 
production? Yes, they answer, we have already begun to do this 
little by little. 
  Yes, investments in production have begun now. Even 1 year 
ago it made no sense to talk about this--money would have been 
spent for nothing, inflation would have eaten it up. Now the 
situation is different. The totality of factors, which I 
mentioned to you, is favorable for investments. One would like 
to see a decision, perhaps of the Duma, perhaps of the 
president--this is not the chief thing--on measures to stimulate 
investments. 
  However, the state does not have enough funds for 
investments. Moreover, even state investments, as is well known, 
are not very effective. But, in general, the locomotive stands 
on tracks, rails need not be laid, they exist. The locomotive 
must be stoked and then it will move by itself. 
  [Pokrovskiy] It seems that you and I have approached the 
favorite question of journalists: How do you evaluate our 
prospects? 
  [Livshits] I have already said that no more than 1 year and, 
perhaps, even less than this remains before the initial stages 
of an economic upsurge--in the absence of a political 
confrontation and with a clear course on the part of the 
government. It should work very actively now. However, all of us 
must have a more careful attitude toward the government. Vast 
efforts are required of it and it must be helped in this. 
  It is primarily a matter of production restructuring and 
reorganization. This is production reform. The government 
adopted a very important decree on the procedure for the 
realization of bankruptcy and so forth. It is not that they want 
to dismiss people, but simply the economy will not withstand the 
production ballast. Other decisions were also adopted. However, 
it is not only a matter of them. They must be realized. We began 
our talk by saying that new programs are not needed, but there 
is a need for a real implementation of adopted decisions. Now we 
have again returned to this. 
  The lack of a thought-out structural policy and of a system 
of priorities is one of our main sore points. We will strive to 
see to it that all the necessary priorities are included in the 
1995 budget. It is well known that the budget is the face of 
power. All the rest are words. Things begin when money is given. 
<H5>  Comments by Igor Lenskiy, Editor of the Issue </H5>
  The published interview is very unexpected for our 
newspaper. 
It is a question of the author's frank attempt to substantiate 
the capitalization of society and reforms, with which each of us 
is familiar from his own experience. Not by chance did Aleksandr 
Solzhenitsyn, in his first interview upon arrival in Russia, 
call them "brainless." Yuriy Polyakov, a writer from another 
generation, who has distinctly established himself in the 
literature of the last decade, who is not a historian, but 
rather an investigator of the contemporary way of life, noted 
recently: "Now everyone admits that reforms did not turn out 
and, if they did, only badly..." The reader will add here his 
own attitude. And so, according to life there is a breakdown in 
our country, while according to Professor Livshits there is 
total order. 
  During the first reading of the interview a number of 
contradictions are conspicuous. 
  1. "Everyone tries to get into the ruble zone, but Russia 
does not strive to go anywhere." This key argument has been 
constantly used for a long time by ultrareformers, beginning 
with Ye. Gaydar and B. Fedorov, to prove the correctness of the 
course of reforms. However, everything is simpler. Did a land as 
great as Russia form part of the former Union? Do such vast 
reserves of raw materials and minerals and such a powerful 
industry exist anywhere? Today we are only burning what God (and 
socialism) gave us, generating an inertia effect for the first 
fruits of reforms. 
  2. Professor A. Livshits asks: "Why should prices be 
constant? After all, the weather changes and over the years even 
a wife changes." Seemingly, everything is right, everything is 
logical. However, why out of all the phenomena accompanying 
shock therapy only an increase in prices is justificatory and 
explainable? And what about real income and the standard of 
living? Are they supposed to be rooted to the spot? Or should 
they also move, but in the opposite direction? 
  3. Professor Livshits' aphorism "the work place is a 
blessing 
that must be earned." No reasons are given for this thought--it 
is put forward as a fact, as an axiom. But let us ponder: In 
order to earn, it is necessary to work! Why suddenly people must 
contest the natural, primordial right to work (which, as is well 
known, created man), shoving each others with elbows? 
  4. "Did communists not propose that order and discipline be 
introduced?" asks A. Livshits, outraged at the position of the 
Duma fraction of the RF Communist Party, which considered the 
president's six recent edicts anticonstitutional. However, 
nowhere, not in a single program document of the Communist 
Party, is legislative norm creation in a nonparliamentary manner 
allowed. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  During the first quarter the decline in industrial 
production 
in Russia made up 25 percent. This is what should not be 
forgotten when discussing the course of reforms.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Rotar: "Attempts Are Being Made To Use </F>
Russian Resettlers as a Political Force: the First Congress of 
Refugees from the Near Abroad Is Over"] 
  [Text] The first congress of refugees and forced resettlers 
from the near abroad took place in Moscow on 2-3 June. The 
Sootechestvenniki [Fellow Countrymen] Russian Foundation for 
Assistance to Refugees was the congress' organizer. Present at 
the congress were more than 500 delegates representing regional 
organizations from almost all of Russia. In essence, for the 
first time since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the refugees 
showed themselves to be an impressive and quite well organized 
force. 
  As Boris Sergeyev, chairman of the Fellow Countrymen 
foundation, reported to those present, even now, around 600,000 
refugees have been officially registered in Russia. However, in 
the foundation chairman's opinion, the actual number of forced 
migrants is much higher, since many of them are living illegally 
in the USSR's legal successor. According to Sergeyev's 
estimates, in the next few years, the number of refugees from 
the outlying districts of the crumbled empire will exceed 6 
million persons. 
  The refugees' relations with the Russian authorities are far 
from ideal and the congress' course demonstrated this fact 
conclusively once again. 
  The tone of the speech of the Federal Migration Service's 
(FMS) administrator, Tatyana Regent, was "repentantly 
self-justifying": "Our service is guilty of failing you, since 
it answers for both the government and the president and even 
for the dissolute parliament." The FMS' administrator frankly 
warned them not to expect an easy life and that, in the future, 
things will be very difficult. The pessimistic notes which crept 
into Regent's speech did not stop her from trying to convince 
those present that the FMS' activities cannot be considered 
useless and that her department is managing all the same to do 
something. According to Tatyana Regent's assertions, several 
ministries and departments, under the guidance of the Ministry 
of Justice, are currently working on supplements to the laws 
previously adopted by the old Supreme Soviet on refugees and 
forced resettlers. The migration service is also advocating 
having the passport offices subordinated directly to it, which 
would make it easier for the refugees to obtain Russian 
citizenship and residence permits. Currently, a draft of a new 
Russian Land Code is being drawn up in the State Duma and the 
FMS wants to set up a special land fund for refugees and 
resettlers. The matter of the exemption of the refugees from 
taxes and the granting of preferential credits to them is being 
decided. Thus, as of 1 May of this year, refugee families 
consisting of three persons are being given interest-free credit 
in the amount of 3 million rubles for the construction of 
housing. The Russian Government is also holding talks with the 
CIS states about them paying compensation to the refugees, 
however, in the opinion of the FMS' administrator, the hopes for 
quick progress are slim. Tatyana Regent emphasized that Moscow's 
financial and credit policies in the states of the near abroad 
are directly tied to the situation of the Russian-speaking 
populations in them. 
  Unfortunately, the speech's stressed sincerity and 
unofficial 
tone could not shake the skepticism of those present. It was 
enough to look at the delegates' faces and to listen to the 
remarks from the audience to be convinced that they do not love 
Tatyana Regent here and they do not trust her department. 
  This purely subjective impression was completely confirmed 
by 
the congress' resolution which the delegates also intend to send 
to Russia's president. 
  The delegates decreed that: 1. The Fellow Countrymen 
foundation shall be recognized as the official intermediary 
between the resettlement organizations and the Russian 
Federation Government, local organs of power and the various 
departments. 2. The subsidies from Moscow for the construction 
of housing and enterprises for refugees should be sent to the 
Fellow Countrymen foundation. 
  In essence, the congress' decision transfers all the FMS' 
basic functions to the Fellow Countrymen foundation, leaving for 
the state structure only the role of sponsor. 
  It is hardly worthwhile discussing now the how well founded 
the refugees' grudges against the FMS officials are and how 
successfully the non-state foundation is able to handle the 
official department's tasks. Something else is much more 
interesting: the refugees' "condemnation" is being automatically 
transferred to the Russian authorities as well. In fact, the FMS 
is the official structure and its disregard of the needs of the 
migrants (as they see themselves) is being identified with the 
position of Russia's leadership. 
  And although currently, the Fellow Countrymen foundation's 
leadership is not ceasing to emphasize that the organization is 
not pursuing any political goals -- the temptation to win over 
to its side the hundreds of thousands of embittered people who 
"no longer have anything to lose" is extraordinarily great for 
all political parties. It is worth noting that the first such 
attempt has already been undertaken at the congress: the 
presidium received a note from delegates from Orel Oblast (one 
of the signatures belonged to the head of the FMS' oblast 
division) with the suggestion that a board of trustees be 
established for the refugees under the chairmanship of Sergay 
Shakhray and that Tatyana Regent be appointed his first deputy. 
And even though the refugees voted down this proposal, no one 
knows how they will regard others.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Demchenko: "Where Do People Get Money?"; </F>
first paragraph is introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] The reality of Russia's situation is probably much 
different from what is generally perceived. Developing and 
prospering parallel to the deep crisis of material production is 
a vast unregistered service sector. 
  According to a widespread view, the slowing of the inflation 
rate in recent months is caused by the more frequent nonpayment 
of wages and salaries at enterprises and organizations. This is 
confirmed by bank statistics which show that cash money 
circulation is falling in Russia. According to official data, 
real wages and real minimum pensions are decreasing, which, it 
is generally believed, account for 85-90% of the monetary 
income of the population. But according to the same data, real 
cash incomes of the population... grow (by 12% in four 
months 
of this year). Bank statistics register the growth of physical 
persons' deposits. The personnel at currency exchange offices in 
Moscow testify that each day a great number of their clients 
convert rubles into dollars; the sums exchanges are frequently 
within the limits of average monthly earnings. Finally, the data 
from the State Committee of Statistics of Russia on the volume 
of the sale of foodstuffs indicate the growth of the 
population's solvent demand.

  A drawback to this table is the fact that its figures do not 
cover all of Russia. They show the volume of sales in foodstuffs 
in an artificially limited number of stores and markets in only 
132 Russian towns which the Statistics Committee has observed 
for a number of years. But this data is comparable since the 
situation has been studied on a regular basis. 
  Judging by this data, demand does not switch from more 
expensive foodstuffs to cheaper ones, for instance, from sausage 
and pastry to macaroni and bread. Contrary to the generally 
accepted view, the cost of foodstuffs relative to the real wages 
of the population (minus taxes and with a correction for the 
inflation index) has decreased by 13-15% on average. 
Contrary 
to the same view, the growth of the sales of macaroni and bread 
does not exceed the growth of the sales of cheese, sausage, 
butter and meat. There was not even a complete switch to 
potatoes from private kitchen-gardens, and more potatoes were 
bought in the trading network than a year ago. As for the 
decrease of the sale of vodka, this evidently testifies to the 
growth of sale outside stores. 
  Where do people get money? What do workers live on whose 
enterprises have not paid their wages for 3-6 months? And, 
incidentally, whence such a growth of foodstuffs when the output 
of the food industry is officially stated as decreasing and the 
import is falling? 
  A considerable number of Russia's citizens have found 
alternative sources of subsistence which are not registered 
officially. Yuri Yurkov, Chairman of Russia's State Committee of 
Statistics, with whom we discussed this problem described these 
sources as "handicrafts" in the sense that they belong in the 
sphere of services: various kinds of repairs and construction, 
consultations, lectures and similar activities. Yurkov also 
expressed his doubt that the rate in the reduction of the index 
of the gross domestic product calculated by his committee on the 
basis of official data is close to reality. This is a truly 
historic statement, since it is the first time that the 
economist in charge of statistic agencies admits that his own 
conviction differs from official material which he himself 
publishes. The structure of the gross domestic product shows a 
sharp reduction of industrial output and an equally sharp 
increase of the share of retail turnover and paid services. The 
chairman of the State Committee of Statistics of the Russian 
Federation said that he feels that the share of paid services 
grows much faster than we record it. 
  The cash turnover in the taxless sector of the economy is 
evidently not big enough so far that it can affect the inflation 
index in the country. Besides that, as Yurkov justly said, the 
money paid in this sector is really and truly earned. Here no 
products are produced which cannot be sold immediately and no 
services are offered which do not have a constantly enhanced 
demand. 
  The chairman of Russia's Statistics Committee believes that 
the original financial source in the taxless sector of the 
economy are the incomes of participants in foreign-economic 
activity. The effectiveness of export operations compared to the 
extreme inefficiency of domestic production is accompanied, 
first, by the release of a considerable share of resources which 
were formerly processed in Russia and, second, by the transfer 
to foreign-economic activity of a considerable number of 
initiative and highly professional workers. Besides that the 
import of cheap food into Russia from and through "near abroad" 
countries which is not registered by official statistics has 
evidently proved profitable. That is why stores have foodstuffs 
to offer despite the fact that officially registered imports and 
their domestic production are decreasing. The hearings on this 
subject conducted by the State Duma at the end of April showed 
that, following the introduction of new import tariffs, the 
state has been practically deprived of income from imports which 
have become illegal and are mainly effected through the 
transparent borders of the "near abroad states." 
  The growing incomes of the participants in foreign-economic 
activity stimulate the domestic demand for high-quality and 
costly services in various sectors. The illegal character of 
profit is evidently one of the causes of the deep-going 
stratification of Russian society. To people who cannot declare 
the source of their incomes the speed of the use of money is 
probably a more important factor than effectiveness. They are 
threatened simultaneously by law-enforcement agencies and the 
criminal world, and that is evidently why consumption receives 
more than is required by rationalism and simply the norms of 
behavior in society. 
  Persons servicing the thin layer of super-rich "new 
Russians" 
form the present "middle class" (middle in the level of incomes) 
whose requirements are more modest but whose number is greater. 
Their requirements are, in turn, satisfied by less well-off 
categories of the population. The involvement in this chain 
allows a considerable number of our citizens to exist tolerably 
well and sometimes quite comfortably. Russia in fact continues 
to live on oil dollars, the only thing that has changed being 
the system of the distribution of incomes. 
  A considerable number of people, continuing to be on the 
staff of enterprises which are "latent bankrupts," have taxless 
sources of income which sometimes exceed the official, taxed 
earnings. A part of these incomes is converted into U.S. 
dollars, especially at the initial stage of redistribution, 
which are turned into rubles when required. The "junior serving 
personnel" of this sector, more inclined to keep their savings 
"in the sock," on the contrary convert the surplus of earned 
rubles into dollars. The vast cash dollar turnover of the 
economy (it is assessed at about six billion dollars in Moscow) 
has allowed so far to support the appearance of relative 
financial stabilization in the ruble space. 
  It is interesting to note from the psychological point of 
view that although the Russians treat US dollars as a means of 
payment, even preferable to rubles, they often do not regard 
them as money. Dollars are spent easier than rubles, as if they 
are not earned but fall from the sky, as bonuses did under 
Soviet power in addition to the main earnings. This ease of 
spending is probably one of the reasons for the incredibly high 
dollar prices of consumer goods in the Russian Federation. 
  If this concept is correct, the overbalance of the 
"handicraft" sector, which was absolutely untypical for former 
Russia, probably threatens us with much faster, sharper and 
irreversible changes than those with which we are ready to 
reconcile ourselves. Nor are any prospects visible in the event 
of the fall in demand for our resources on world markets or the 
exhaustion of these resources. 
  The author offers her thanks to the Center of Economic 
Conditions for its kind assistance in the selection of 
statistical data.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch, candidate for </F>
Ukrainian president, by Anatoliy Yeremenko; place and date not 
given: "Ivan Plyushch: The Donbass Is the Promising Area of 
Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch started his 
preelection trip with the Donbass. The position of the powerful 
industrial kray certainly will prove decisive in the campaign 
for the high post of president. It is clear that it is not 
particularly necessary to introduce the former Supreme Council 
chairman to the Donbass residents. Plyushch here, as however in 
all of Ukraine, is well-known and respected--for the wisdom and 
talent of the leader of a state, breadth of state thinking, and 
consistency in the defense of the interests of the people. 
  Ivan Stepanovych visited the hospitable Donetsk land 
for two days--he met with miners of the mine imeni Abakumov, 
machine builders of the Buran plant, and the plant imeni 
Petrovskiy. He discussed problems of the coal industry with 
specialists of the Donetskugol association. We met late in the 
evening after his intensive visit to miners and an hour-long 
discourse with a television audience on live TV. 
  [Yeremenko] Ivan Stepanovych, as you correctly noted on the 
program, the programs of the aspirants to the post of president 
of Ukraine are similar in many ways. Concern about the 
individual worker stands out in each. The difference is only in 
the order of setting forth basic points. But there is also a 
principal difference. How do you see our state in the future: 
unitary or federative? It was two years ago that you said here 
in Donetsk that federalization is useful. At the same time, you 
emphasized that if everything is done rapidly, this could lead 
only to damage. What do you think today? 
  [Plyushch] I also think this now. First of all, it is 
necessary to clarify just what we want from federalization. 
What, are we attracted by a fashionable word? Is the main thing 
not to call an oblast an oblast, but precisely a land? But if we 
mean to delegate a significant part of power to the regions and 
local organs of authority, then I am for such a federation. I am 
for it with both hands. But if we want each region to consider 
itself independent from Kiev, then such a federation will give 
no benefit either to Kiev, or to our state. So let us decide the 
essence and not the form. 
  My opponents claim that I, they say, am for full economic 
independence, but against political independence. But permit me 
to ask: What is economic and what is political independence. 
According to what methodology are they divided? It seems to me 
that economics is a continuation of politics, and that politics 
is a continuation of economics. Everything is closely 
interrelated. And it is not necessary to absolutize and to 
politicize the problem. Really, by federation, I understand 
maximum independence in the resolution of the overwhelming 
majority of questions on a regional level. But the region's 
connection with the state is implemented through a system of 
taxation and the structure of general state organs, and 
specifically: customs, force ministries, procuracies, courts, 
banks, and the credit-financial system. And there is no need to 
be afraid. Here is an appropriate case. For example, Donetskugol 
has established a departmental bank. It already has 16 branches 
and correspondent accounts in eight CIS countries and in a dozen 
countries of the far abroad. In turn, Prominvestbank and the 
National Bank are trying in various ways to keep it on a leash. 
The phenomena are understandable--authority is not given up that 
easily. But, nevertheless, however difficult it may be, 
Donuglekombank is operating. And this, you will agree, is good. 
Owing to the bank, the association is resolving many production 
questions, and it is becoming like a state within a state. So 
then, is this separatism? I see here an economic independence 
that is an obligatory element of federalization. 
  [Yeremenko] How do you assess the conference of leaders of 
the border oblasts of Ukraine and Russia that is being held in 
Donetsk? 
  [Plyushch] The meeting, and this is the third of its kind, 
is 
very necessary. It promotes the development of communications 
and turning out suitable legislative acts concerning border 
oblasts, and the establishment of clear borders, as in the whole 
civilized world. It is time to move from words to action. A 
world, Asiatic, and various markets exist. Why should a mutually 
profitable market of CIS countries not work? Who is prohibiting 
it? I was at the Buran plant yesterday--in two and a half 
months--it is simply fantastic! It created a new mining machine 
that is on the level of the best world models. I asked--where 
did you get the parts? It turns out that 13 percent are from the 
far abroad, 18 percent are Russian, and the rest are ours. And 
how are you cooperating with Russia, I inquired of the director? 
Normally, he answered. You, in the newspaper, must 
especially emphasize something that has been pretty well 
forgotten: He who wants to do, finds the means, but he who does 
not, finds excuses. 
  Of course, it is necessary to help the coal industry, but 
the 
main thing is to at least not interfere. The development of 
Donetskugol under the difficult conditions of a general crisis 
demonstrates this well. The Donbass is our extremely promising 
region. And strengthening its economic equal rights relations 
with Russia will undoubtedly only accrue to the benefit of all 
of Ukraine. 
  [Yeremenko] Ivan Stepanovych, what are your political 
sympathies, and who are you counting on during the elections? 
  [Plyushch] I am counting on our people, on their common 
sense. 
  ...The time of the meeting passed imperceptibly. Ivan 
Stepanovych's extended journey led to Zaporozhye. It seems that 
he departed Donetsk, having received fairly good support. The 
miners of the Donetskugol association alone submitted almost 
25,000 signatures in his behalf.

<F P=106> [Interview with Volodymyr Hrynyov by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA </F>
correspondent Arkadiy Romm; place and date not given; under the 
rubric "Image": "Centrists Hope To Take Kiev"] 
  [Text] Volodymyr Hrynyov's name is not on the list of 
Ukrainian presidential candidates. A politician popular in the 
republic, in the recent past deputy chairman of the Ukrainian 
parliament, today he is busy organizing the election campaign of 
his confederate in the Interregional Reform Bloc--Leonid Kuchma. 
Of course, in the event Kuchma wins, Hrynyov can count on a 
leading role in the new Kiev leadership. What ideology does the 
"Kuchma team" preach; what will its advent to power mean for 
Ukraine, for Russo-Ukrainian relations--this is the topic of our 
OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent's interview with Volodymyr 
Hrynyov. 
  [Hrynyov] Within a few months we will have to decide what 
kind of state we are building. I personally feel that we are at 
a "fork"--we can still slide back into the totalitarian past, or 
we can move toward a civilized society. The state that is 
currently being built, in my opinion, was "designed" extremely 
poorly. Especially unsuccessful was the system of interaction 
between the center and the regions. We, those who live in 
Ukraine, feel how strong regional instability is. The same may 
be said about the economic crisis. No matter what current acting 
Prime Minister Yefim Zvyahylskyy tells us, in reality production 
is declining, hidden unemployment flourishing, and social 
tension growing. In short, the economic situation differs a lot 
from the blissful appraisal. 
  [Romm] Do you see the way out of the crisis? 
  [Hrynyov] We need a centrist party. Which is precisely what 
we are setting up on the basis of our Interregional Reform Bloc. 
It would appear that the old parliament did everything possible 
to prevent political structuring: The law on elections does not 
envisage any party lists. But the process of precisely this kind 
of structuring is currently underway in the parliament. It 
reflects a public need--the peak of the "antiparty mood" is 
behind us; the time has come when people have accepted the idea 
of parties pursuing a certain ideology. Today the communist and 
socialist parties, as well as Rukh, show that there is no other 
way. 
  [Romm] Since your confederate in the bloc is a presidential 
candidate, it is obvious that your party presents itself as a 
presidential party, is it not? 
  [Hrynyov] A president who does not have a base in a certain 
political force does not have a chance of governing society. 
This is clear in the example of Leonid Kravchuk, who in his 
search for support jumps from Rukh to the socialists. One can 
also see it in the example of our government, which is in a 
"suspended state." Yes, our party thinks of itself as a 
presidential party; its program tasks are market reform of the 
Ukrainian economy (because we do not have a market); transition 
to an open civil society; and the creation of a multinational 
state with a federative lands structure. 
  [Romm] You are frequently accused of being circumspect 
toward 
Moscow. 
  [Hrynyov] Yes, Kuchma and I are being accused of betraying 
national interests. I am convinced, however, that an attempt to 
create some sort of a phenomenon of fast integration with Europe 
is precisely the way to lose our independence. For me, 
orientation toward Moscow is the only way to survive. If Ukraine 
now gives up the Eurasian market, within whose framework its 
economy may rise to a civilized level, this will represent a 
catastrophic failure of our foreign policy. It can be avoided 
only by aligning with Moscow--without groveling before it, of 
course. 
  [Romm] How probable is it that Leonid Kuchma will win the 
next presidential elections? 
  [Hrynyov] Kuchma currently has the best chance. As compared 
to the closest rival, Leonid Kravchuk--a five-to-three chance. 
But Kravchuk has been rather confidently gaining points lately. 
He is conducting a well-calculated election campaign. Our 
forecast is that these two candidates will undoubtedly make it 
to the second round, and almost neck to neck at that. 
  [Romm] Are you sure that the elections will not be 
postponed? 
  [Hrynyov] Parliament will not have enough muscle to vote 
against the elections. 
  [Romm] How do you and your confederates in the Interregional 
Reform Bloc appraise the Crimean situation and the causes that 
brought it about? 
  [Hrynyov] I already mentioned the degradation of our 
economy, 
a poorly chosen strategy for the organizational development of 
the state, imposing administrative models that are alien to the 
regions. All these factors caused the Crimean crisis. Although 
Russian politicians contributed their share to this issue as 
well. 
  According to the Crimean constitution in its 1992 version, 
Crimea is a sovereign state and builds its relations with all 
states on the basis of treaties. It may sign such a treaty with 
Ukraine and remain part of it, as Tatarstan is in Russia. If the 
Crimean leadership, with popular support, goes all the way, 
though, in the best-case scenario the outcome will be secession, 
and in the worst--the blood of hundreds of thousands of people. 
  In our opinion, the Crimean problem may be absorbed by the 
problem of Russo-Ukrainian rapprochement. Not too long ago a 
meeting of Russian and Ukrainian politicians took place in 
Kharkiv. We undertook to develop an ideology of strategic 
cooperation in time for the September meeting; it must be 
reflected in a joint document to be adopted by the governments 
of both countries. 
  I stay in contact with the Crimean Government and I know 
that 
everybody there is aware of this: If Crimea remains in this 
suspended state for another half a year--with people being 
afraid to travel there and everything being extremely 
tense--this will be a fiasco for the Crimean authorities. 
Destabilization of the situation in the Crimea is not in the 
interests of either Ukraine or Russia; therefore, it will be 
supported from different sides. Crimea should become a bridge 
between our states, not a bone of contention.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor M. Kyriyenko, doctor of economic </F>
sciences: "The Three I's of Leonid Kravchuk: Inconsistency, 
Indecision, Indeterminateness"] 
  [Text] It is no longer a secret for anyone that Ukraine is 
on the brink of an unprecedented economic crisis, which in terms 
of its consequences and losses is tantamount to a great war. The 
inept former parliament and a president who procrastinates for 
years have brought this about. Instead of creating the necessary 
conditions to develop production and ensure an improvement in 
the welfare of the population following the proclamation of 
independence, the president and the power structure have done 
everything in order to cause in the country economic chaos and 
an extraordinary crisis, the like of which nobody in the world 
has experienced. There has been a lot of twaddle under the 
leadership of the president; actually, everything has been done 
in order not to approve a new democratic Constitution, which 
would have set the direction for building the state and codified 
the supremacy of the people, rather than the bureaucratic power 
structure. The people remain deprived of their rights and 
reduced to despair and misery in an independent Ukraine under 
President L. Kravchuk, just as they previously were under 
Stalin's and Brezhnev's rule. 
  Now that the holding of the 26 June presidential election is 
drawing nearer, the president and his entourage are doing 
everything so that the election will not be held. The president 
understands that a new stage of building the state is coming 
which calls for a new strategy and tactic and for a renewal of 
the confidence of the people. They are in mortal fear of the 
election, which will amount to the verdict of the people for the 
woes and misery that they have brought down on the people. The 
political "dodges" of the president were revealed to the fullest 
extent in a conversation with journalists during his visit to 
the editorial office of the newspaper KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, in 
other presentations, and in his address to the new parliament. 
  On 20 February of this year, Leonid Makarovych announced his 
decision not to take part in the next presidential election on a 
Radio Liberty program. The president stated: "My participation 
in the election is infeasible, as is the election itself." 
  The predominant motif in all presentations of the president 
is: The election should be postponed until a new Constitution is 
adopted and until the powers of the president and the government 
are defined. This begs the question: Who prevented the president 
from recommending that the parliament develop and approve a new 
Constitution, using the mandate of people's confidence, which 
the president to my mind does not justify? Was there not enough 
time? 
  There was time. In the process, the president could have 
displayed the kind of determination he did in order to destroy 
the USSR in Belovezhskaya Pushcha, referring to the people's 
mandate and the Independence Declaration. 
  The president has started to worry about the 
constitutionality of the election. If we proceed from the need 
for the new parliament to restore the absolute sovereignty of 
the people, rather than the power structure, the election will 
be constitutional in nature. The election will affirm the 
superiority of the power of the people who have been reduced to 
starvation and poverty, the people whom some are already calling 
"brutes." Each candidate for president will present his program, 
which will outline the key state-creating democratic provisions 
that will later be contributed to the development of a 
democratic Constitution of the independent state. 
  As President L.M. Kravchuk was signing the Election Law, he 
believed that this law was not for him: "This was unacceptable 
for me." "As I signed the law, I knew what I was doing, but even 
then I made the decision for myself: It was not for me.... It 
was required by strikes and political demands." [preceding 
statements by Kravchuk given in Russian in the original] Such is 
the attitude of the president toward the law. The will of the 
people may be frivolously toyed with. None other than the 
president has talked repeatedly about the creation of a 
rule-of-law state in which the law should be complied with by 
each citizen, from the president on down to the lowly clerk. 
  The president is intimidating the parliament with the fact 
that the entire responsibility will devolve to it if it confirms 
the decision of the former Supreme Council, because that 
parliament does not exist anymore. It is not a secret to anyone 
that L.M. Kravchuk wishes to keep himself as president and his 
bankrupt bureaucratic-administrative system as long as possible. 
Leonid Makarovych maintains that a president with unknown powers 
may be elected, whereas differing interests of diverse regions 
of Ukraine exist, which may bring about a confrontation. 
  To my mind, the people will be able to assess the programs 
of 
all candidates for president through the election--programs that 
could unite the fundamental interests of the people of Ukraine 
in the east and the west, and in the south and the north alike. 
The early election of the president and local councils on 26 
June will allow the people of Ukraine to reveal their genuine 
will and give them an opportunity to elect such a president and 
such local organs that will be capable of making Ukraine into a 
civilized state.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Kuryanovych: "New Wave--a Breeze or a </F>
Tidal Wave?"] 
  [Text] Lvov--The "TV--Brand-New Minute" sticker is affixed 
to the TV set at the headquarters of New Wave. This points 
symbolically to the young age of the organization and the 
average age of its members. However, the poetic name New Wave 
has a strictly political implication, which is determined by the 
formula: New ideas for the society, new elite for the 
authorities. 
<H5>  The Forerunner </H5>
  The "wave" rippled through the political surface of the Lvov 
area on 15 February of this year. The idea came to Mykhaylo 
Kosiv and was very simple: to unite the people with democratic 
views for participation in the election, with no regard to party 
affiliation or independent status. The project was supported by 
Mykhaylo Kosiv's colleagues in the parliament--Ihor Hryniv, 
Viktor Pynzenyk, Taras Stetskiv, and Ihor Yukhnovskyy. Young 
people--Levko Zakharchyshyn, Yuriy Kolotiy, Ihor Koliushko, 
Oleksandr Kryvenko, Oleksandr Pavlenko, and others--joined the 
well-known politicians. For politicians from these circles, the 
participation of New Wave in the election was determined by two 
tasks: to get its candidates elected to the Supreme Council and 
to coordinate the pre-election efforts of the 
national-democratic center (first of all, New Wave, the NRU 
[People's Rukh of Ukraine], and the URP [Ukrainian Republican 
Party]) in order to have as many democratic deputies elected as 
possible. 
  Out of 11 candidates on the New Wave list, four were elected 
to the parliament (we do not count Mykhaylo Kosiv, who was 
officially registered as an NRU member, but do include in this 
number Ihor Yukhnovskyy, who was nominated by New Wave, although 
he later left it). The average number of votes given for one New 
Wave representative was 16,100 (followed by the KUN [Congress of 
Ukrainian Nationalists]--16,000, the NRU--15,300, the UNA 
[Ukrainian National Assembly]--9,100). Most of the New Wave 
members who lost the election ranked among the top five 
candidates in their districts. New Wave has a long "second 
string," which, in the absence of leaders already elected to the 
Supreme Council, may play in the local elections. 
  However, it would hardly be correct to give credit for a 
measure of New Wave's success in the election solely to the 
organization. The seats were won primarily by those who have 
well-known political names (with the exception of Ihor 
Koliushko). That little-known New Wave members who, in terms of 
their potential, are worthy of a seat, were not elected may be 
put down as a demerit to the association precisely as an 
organization. 
  New Wave has virtually failed to accomplish its second 
task--to consolidate national-democratic forces. As Yuriy 
Shveda, the chairman of the New Wave secretariat, said in a 
conversation, the Ukrainian Republican Party resolved to act on 
its own and, judging by the result, clearly overestimated its 
potential. Contacts with Rukh were more fruitful; in some 
districts, the NRU acted in concert with New Wave, although the 
latter itself compromised more frequently, perhaps even to the 
detriment of its own interests. In four districts, the Rukh 
people, while not running their own candidates, did not place 
the nominees of New Wave on their support list; in another four 
districts, New Wave and Rukh competed against each other. 
  The election has objectively determined the place of New 
Wave 
among the leading political forces of the region: the 
NRU--292,000 votes, the KUN--239,000, New Wave--177,000, the 
URP--134,000, the UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National 
Assembly-Ukrainian People's Self-Defense Forces]--103,000. These 
"big five," having won approximately 58 percent of the votes of 
the total number of the voting electorate and more than 82 
percent of the votes given for candidates with a party 
affiliation, will undoubtedly determine the political reality of 
the Lvov area in the immediate future. 
  This electoral analysis prompted the organizers to consider 
the feasibility of New Wave not only as an electoral 
association, but as a permanent political organization. It was 
registered on 6 May of this year, and on 9 May, the first 
convention of the New Wave public organization was held. 
However, will New Wave be of strictly regional significance? To 
answer this question, let us add a few strokes to its portrait. 
<H5>  The Magnitude and the Direction </H5>
  New Wave is a public organization, but its registration 
document specifies that it aims to participate in the political 
process. In the words of Yuriy Shveda, it does not desire to 
become a party, because party discipline and hierarchy scare 
away the intellectual elite who do not wish to subordinate their 
thinking and actions to firm party norms. Finally, the status of 
a public organization makes it possible for members of parties 
to participate in it without quitting the parties. Members of 
the PDVU [Party of the Democratic Revival of Ukraine], the 
"Green" Party, the Social-Democratic Party, the Republican 
Party, the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, and the Union of 
Officers of Ukraine will run for New Wave in the local election. 
  As of the moment it was founded, New Wave numbered 152 
members. The Council, consisting of Mykhaylo Kosiv (chairman), 
Ihor Hryniv, Ihor Koliushko, Viktor Pynzenyk, Taras Stetskiv, 
and Yuriy Shveda (chairman of the secretariat--New Wave's 
working organ), is the leading organ of the party. Rayon 
organizations have been formed in Gorodok, Kamenka-Bugskaya, 
Zhidachev, and Dublyany. New Wave allows collective memberships; 
requests have already been filed by the Union of Architects of 
Ukraine and the Oblast Association of Handicapped. According to 
Shveda, in the immediate future the Association of the Left and 
the Student Fraternities of the Polytechnical Institute and the 
Forestry Institute may join New Wave. Yuriy Shveda responded 
thus to the question of whether the organization is to be a mass 
or an elitist one: "We would like our ideas to spread and enjoy 
mass support; in turn, this would give us an opportunity to 
implement our ideas through the parliament. Our attitude toward 
the qualitative composition of the organization is very 
discriminating, and we will prevent its penetration by the 
underclass in every way. This is not to say that the path to the 
organization is closed for workers or peasants. Admission to New 
Wave is not made contingent upon one's education and social 
status." 
  As Yuriy Shveda said, New Wave is a national-democratic 
organization of a centrist, liberal orientation, although 
social-democratic views will also be manifested in it. New Wave 
believes that a transition to capitalism will have to be made 
sooner or later, and proposes to do it urgently in order to 
overcome the crisis sooner. Its main programmatic principles are 
to build up an independent Ukrainian state, develop a democratic 
society, and carry out immediate, profound economic reforms. It 
is important that New Wave does not restrict itself to 
programmatic slogans, but also has substantial studies, in 
particular, an economic reform program developed under the 
guidance of Viktor Pynzenyk. As far as the notion of national 
democracy is concerned, said Shveda, there are organizations 
that stress the first part of this combination of words, whereas 
others stress the second part. For its part, New Wave strives to 
organically combine them. 
<H5>  Allies </H5>
  The New Wave leaders count among such the 
national-democratic 
organizations with a centrist orientation, primarily Rukh and 
the Ukrainian Republican Party, as well as the Congress of 
Ukrainian Nationalists, which, to the mind of Taras Stetskiv, 
while based on nationalist ideology, is not an extreme force on 
the pattern of the national-radicals. Yuriy Klyuchkovskyy, 
chairman of the Rukh Lvov Regional Organization, and Oleh 
Pavlyshyn, chairman of the URP Lvov Oblast Organization, fully 
agree that it is feasible to form a bloc of New Wave-NRU-URP-KUN 
(with the addition of smaller organizations--the DemPU 
[Democratic Party of Ukraine], the PZU [Green Party of Ukraine], 
the SDPU [Social-Democratic Party of Ukraine]). However, 
attempts to form a bloc have already run into insurmountable 
obstacles now, before the local election. Yuriy Shveda thinks 
that the position of the leaders is at issue, their desire for 
their own organization to be the leader in the bloc. Oleh 
Pavlyshyn put the problem [word illegible] down to 
contradictions in attitudes toward certain candidates in 
elections, but upon reflection noted that competition for the 
greatest influence, which cannot but occur among the leading 
forces, is also to blame. Ivan Hubka, chairman of the leadership 
of the KUN Lvov Oblast Organization, considers Rukh and the URP 
possible allies, although he complains about misunderstandings 
during the pre-election coordination of candidacies. As far as 
New Wave is concerned, to his mind, it does not have a national 
enough orientation. On the contrary, Rukh leader Yuriy 
Klyuchkovskyy believes that New Wave has shown itself to be a 
sufficiently national organization. If we sum up the positions 
of party leaders, it is easy to come to the conclusion that 
there are no fundamental obstacles to forming a bloc. However, 
small differences are frequently impossible to overcome if the 
leaders are not prepared to compromise for the sake of pooling 
their efforts. 
<H5>  Non-Allies </H5>
  As Shveda and Koliushko said, New Wave will not cooperate 
with the left (i.e., the Socialists and Communists) and the 
extreme right (the All-People's Rukh of Ukraine, the Ukrainian 
Conservative Republican Party, the Ukrainian National Assembly, 
the Social-National Party of Ukraine), as a result of 
ideological differences. The attitudes of the right and the left 
toward New Wave differ. Yuriy Shukhevich, chairman of the UNA, 
called New Wave and the PDVU organizations that are hostile to 
Ukrainian nationalism and, correspondingly, the UNA. Oleksandr 
Holub, first secretary of the CPU [Communist Party of Ukraine] 
oblast committee, describes New Wave as a "bourgeois-democratic" 
organization, but does not rule out the possibility of 
cooperation, noting that New Wave has bright political 
personalities. 
<H5>  New Wave and the Local Authorities </H5>
  The attitude toward the local authorities is very critical. 
Yuriy Shveda believes that most local organs of power, 
especially in the oblast, are organs that have become 
"self-contained," are not in touch with the public, and look 
after their own corporate interests in order to keep their 
positions. To Shveda's mind, the authorities have failed to 
create conditions for the economic development of the oblast and 
have turned out to be incapable of the substantive analysis of 
the condition of the economy and the preparation of programs for 
its optimum development. Such pronouncements differ from the 
position of the URP, which has nominated the current chairman of 
the Lvov Oblast Council, Mykhaylo Horyn, to that position. For 
its part, New Wave suggests that the voters vote for Stepan 
Pavlyuk, the director of the Ethnographic Institute and a former 
Supreme Council deputy. The KUN supports Myroslav Senyk, 
chairman of the state property fund. Rukh is to make a 
determination at the next meeting of the regional council on 7 
June and choose between the two candidates, Senyk and Pavlyuk. 
However, the three organizations--New Wave, the NRU, and the 
KUN--have agreed on the candidate for the position of mayor of 
Lvov--on Rukh member Vasyl Kuybida. This indicates that the 
positions of New Wave, Rukh, and the Congress of Ukrainian 
Nationalists are drawing closer and opens prospects for closer 
cooperation during the election. For its part, the URP has 
altogether broken away from them; its leadership has resolved in 
agony (by a vote of seven to five) to support for this position 
URP member Semkiv, sympathy for whom has, incidentally, also 
been announced by extreme right radicals. 
  In addition, New Wave has nominated its candidates for the 
oblast council in 36 districts, and for the city council in 47 
districts. 
<H5>  New Wave and the Supreme Council </H5>
  Ihor Koliushko responded in the affirmative to the question 
of whether the members of parliament who ran for New Wave 
consider themselves its representatives in the Supreme Council. 
A group of New Wave men--Viktor Pynzenyk, Taras Stetskiv, and 
Ihor Koliushko--joined the Reforms parliamentary group; Mykhaylo 
Kosiv joined the NRU faction, and Ihor Yukhnovskyy--the 
Statehood group. Undoubtedly, New Wave nominees are sufficiently 
prominent figures not to be lost amid the mass of deputies. 
There is a different question: Will they proclaim themselves to 
be New Wave representatives? This may be of fundamental 
significance if New Wave does not intend to remain a mere 
regional organization. 
<H5>  Prospects </H5>
  Will New Wave remain a regional organization, or will it 
strive for an all-Ukrainian status? Yuriy Shveda noted that 
relations are already being established with organizations whose 
views are close to New Wave in Ternopol, Ivano-Frankovsk, and in 
the Khmelnitskiy and Zaporozhye areas. Ihor Koliushko believes 
that the creation of an all-Ukrainian organization is possible 
primarily on initiative from below rather than from the center, 
and in the long term such a process is quite realistic. One 
thing is indisputable: The future belongs to the organization 
that will be able to unite centrist, national-democratic, and 
democratic currents in various regions of the state. To date, 
there has not been such an organization in Ukraine--all 
political forces are of a monoregional, and therefore marginal 
nature. Does New Wave constitute an attempt to contradict this 
rule?

<F P=106> [Report of the Lvov Oblast Statistical Administration: "The </F>
Year Began Badly. We Have To Save Ourselves!"] 
  [Text] In the first quarter of 1994, social 
production declined, labor productivity decreased as the number 
of people holding jobs fell, and the rise in price increases was 
slowed down but not halted. 
<H5>  The Decline Continues </H5>
  Compared with last year's first quarter, industrial output 
in 
Lvov Oblast fell by 43.3 percent as against a 1.9-percent drop 
in the first quarter of 1993 and a total decrease of 15.9 
percent for 1993 as a whole. Although the decline in industrial 
production was even greater in some regions (output in Kherson, 
Luhansk, and Volyn Oblasts fell to less than half the previous 
level), this rate was lower for Ukraine as a whole, averaging 
38.4 percent. 
  Industrial output fell at 389 enterprises, which accounts 
for 
82.8 percent of all the oblast's enterprises. Only Radekhiv and 
Sambir rayons managed to maintain the same production volumes as 
in the first quarter of 1993. Labor productivity in the oblast 
fell by 38.5 percent. 
  The main reason for this unsatisfactory state of industrial 
production is the nonpayments crisis, which makes it difficult 
for enterprises to obtain the necessary raw materials and 
material and technical supplies on the one hand and, on the 
other hand, to sell their output. 
  The largest drops in output occurred in the fuel industry, 
at 
enterprises of the chemical and petrochemical industries, and in 
machinebuilding and metalworking. Among the principal kinds of 
machinebuilding products, only the production of woodworking 
machine tools rose. The output of metalworking tools and 
agricultural machinery fell by 80 to 90 percent, that of 
automatic loaders, buses, and gas ranges to one-third of their 
previous level, and production of forging and pressing 
equipment, medical equipment, and pipeline fittings to less than 
half. The production of all kinds of building materials 
decreased: cement, bricks, precast reinforced concrete 
constructions and components, ceramic tiles, soft roofing 
materials, window glass, and ceramic plumbing fixtures. The 
output of the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry 
fell substantially. 
  The worst aspect of this is that industrial enterprises are 
unable to introduce the latest scientific-technical advances 
into production, which restricts their ability to increase labor 
productivity. Thus, only 27 new technological processes 
(including three low-waste, resource-conserving, and waste-free 
processes) were introduced in the first quarter. This is a 
decrease of nearly 50 percent as compared with the same period 
in 1993. The production of 247 new kinds of industrial products 
has been set up, which constitutes a drop of 36 percent, as 
compared with last year. 
<H5>  Things Are Also Bad in the Social Sector </H5>
  The sale of livestock and poultry for slaughter fell by 34 
percent as against the first quarter of last year, milk 
production--7 percent, eggs--26 percent. Average milk yield per 
cow amounted to 465 kg, or 6 kg less than in January-March of 
last year, in contrast to a rise of 11 kg in Ukraine as a whole. 
Average egg yield per chicken totalled 34 eggs--a decrease of 
eight eggs per chicken, as compared with last year. 
  At the beginning of April of this year, the number of head 
of 
meat cattle (including cows) at agricultural enterprises 
totalled 533,300, which is 9 percent less than on the same date 
last year. The number of cows, hogs, and poultry dropped. During 
the first three months of this year, the oblast's agroindustrial 
entities sold the population 26,400 piglets and 45,800 head of 
poultry--a 15-percent increase over the same period last year. 
  Since the beginning of the year, agricultural producers, 
including those with subsidiary plots and private farms, sold 
the state 20,800 metric tons of cattle and poultry in 
liveweight, 50,400 metric tons of milk and milk products, and 
26.1 million eggs. These figures are also lower than last year's. 
<H5>  There Is Less Fuel, but Sowing Is Progressing at a Faster </H5>
Pace 
  In the period between January and March of this year, 
collective and state agricultural enterprises received 20,600 
metric tons of diesel fuel, or 8 percent less than during the 
corresponding period last year, and 8,400 metric tons of 
gasoline (44 percent less than last year). The amount of 
available diesel fuel on the date of this report was 6,900 
metric tons, or 27 percent less than last year, and of 
gasoline--2,600 metric tons, or 52 percent less. 
  The oblast's farms are sowing spring crops at a much faster 
pace than last year. By 25 April, they had sown 174,900 hectares 
of land, including 88,300 hectares of grain and pulse crops 
(excluding corn), 34,500 hectares of sugar beets, 7,600 hectares 
of fiber flax, and 3,900 hectares of potatoes. 
<H5>  There Is Too Little Investment </H5>
  Capital stock valued at 162 billion karbovantsy has been put 
into operation in the oblast. Capital investments amounted to 
671 billion karbovantsy, which is 29 percent less than during 
the same period last year. State capital investments account for 
four-fifths of the total sum. Spending on construction has 
increased nearly 60 percent as against the relevant period last 
year. 
  Only 9 percent of the state funds were channeled into the 
creation of the active portion of fixed capital, which attests 
to the low degree of effectiveness with which these funds were 
used. Almost half the funds were spent on the construction of 
social and consumer facilities and housing. This indicator for 
Ukraine as a whole averages 45 percent. 
  The share of capital investments derived from centralized 
sources of financing, which make up 17 percent of the total 
volume, is continuing to fall. Building organizations using 
their own resources performed jobs under contract at agreed-to 
prices in the total amount of 546 billion karbovantsy. Compared 
with the same period last year, the volume of work has decreased 
by 33.3 percent. The rate of housing construction is falling. 
<H5>  Transport Is Laid Up </H5>
  The main territorial enterprise of the Lvov Railroad system 
shipped 3.3 million metric tons of freight during the first 
quarter, or 31.9 percent less than during the same period last 
year. The amount of freight shipped was 7.5 million metric tons, 
or 38.1 percent less than last year. The amount of freight 
dispatched by all railroad transport in Ukraine dropped 35 
percent. Less freight (by 35.9 percent) was also unloaded. 
  Motor transport carried only half as much freight as during 
the first quarter of the preceding year, while passenger traffic 
did not drop substantially. The main reason for a rise in motor 
transport stoppages was a lack of fuel and freight. 
  Air transport has become almost inaccessible: 54.5 percent 
fewer passengers were transported and 82.4 percent less freight. 
  During the first quarter of this year, pipelines carried 
1,739,000 metric tons of oil. Of this amount, 1,700,000 metric 
tons was oil that passed in transit through the oblast on its 
way to West European countries. 
  Communications enterprises earned 118.7 billion karbovantsy 
from their principal activity, including 21.3 billion 
karbovantsy from the sale of services to consumers. 
<H5>  But Wages Are Rising </H5>
  Compared with the first quarter of last year, the total 
amount of nominal personal monetary income in the oblast 
increased 29.9-fold (24.5-fold in 1993, as against 1992). Wages 
and other income from enterprises and organizations accounted 
for nearly 67 percent of the total sum of personal monetary 
income (as compared with 58 percent in the first quarter of 
1993). The reason for this is that the growth of funds channeled 
into consumption at enterprises in the state sector of the 
economy outstripped other sources of monetary income. Average 
monthly per capita income in the first quarter of this year was 
713,900 karbovantsy, and the average monthly wage was 668,900 
karbovantsy. These amounts were 40 and 39 times greater, 
respectively, than in the first quarter of last year. 
  However, the cost of consumer goods and paid services has 
increased 54.7-fold. Still, the growth of prices and rates of 
goods and services has slowed down somewhat for the first time 
in the past two years: in January (as against the preceding 
month), prices and rates rose by 17.7 percent, in February--by 
13.6 percent, and in March--by 3.2 percent. 
  Prices of agricultural products as a whole fell at Lvov 
markets by 3.2 percent. Livestock product prices dropped by 6.1 
percent, while produce prices rose by 30.7 percent. 
<H5>  And There Is Something Left To Put Away in a Sock </H5>
  The total amount of money spent by the oblast's population 
during the first quarter, as recorded by the financial system, 
increased 27-fold, as compared with the relevant period of last 
year. This sum was lower by 276 billion karbovantsy, or 9.1 
percent, than the total amount of monetary income. The total 
volume of retail goods turnover also rose, although the supply 
of goods fell by 40.9 percent, including by 67.5 percent in the 
consumer cooperatives. (The total volume of retail goods 
turnover in Ukraine as a whole fell during this period by 47.6 
percent.) 
  Consumers bought more food products and fewer nonfood 
consumer items. They economized on oil, margarine, confectionary 
and sausage products, meat and poultry, canned fish, butter, and 
even bread. Only half as much bread was sold as before; it is 
obviously not being used to feed pigs. 
  Revenues from paid services amounted to 474.4 billion 
karbovantsy. The volume of these services exceeded the volume 
sold during the corresponding period of last year by a factor of 
54.1, but dropped by 7.7 percent in comparable prices. (The 
volume of paid services in Ukraine as a whole fell by 17 percent 
during this period.) 
<H5>  The Industry of Prosperity Is Losing Ground </H5>
  Local production of consumer goods is largely responsible 
for 
the critical situation in the consumer market. The volume of 
consumer goods produced in the first quarter of 1994 (in 
wholesale factory prices) was valued at 3.3 billion karbovantsy, 
or 4,365 percent less than during the same period last year. In 
Ukraine as a whole, the output of consumer goods decreased an 
average of 3,962 percent. Lvov Oblast, which until quite 
recently ranked first [in consumer goods production], has now 
dropped to fifth place (following Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, and 
Kharkiv Oblasts and the city of Kiev). 
  Production in all groups of goods has fallen, especially 
woolen and silk fabrics, nonwoven materials, knitted underwear 
and other knitted apparel, sown products, leather footwear, 
hosiery, textile haberdashery products. The output of children's 
products decreased three- to eightfold. 
  There has been a significant drop in the output of 
television 
sets--threefold; mopeds--6.9-fold; children's 
bicycles--2.1-fold; jewelry products--3.8-fold; household 
chemical agents--2.2-fold; and furniture--1.8-fold. 
  The output of almost all principal food products has 
dropped, 
except for high-fat cheeses and baking yeast. There has been a 
significant decrease in the production of meat (37.1 percent), 
canned fruits (42.3 percent), cereals (29.7 percent), macaroni 
products (49.4 percent), margarine products (49.7 percent), 
nonalcoholic beverages (46.2 percent), confectionary products 
(32.6 percent). 
<H5>  Privatization Is Being Stepped Up... </H5>
  By 1 January 1994, 322 state and municipal objects had been 
privatized, while, just in the first three months of this year, 
162 objects were privatized. Of this last group, 27 passed into 
full private ownership, 134 are now collectively owned, and one 
has a mixed form of ownership. The privatization of the state 
housing fund is being conducted at a faster pace. During 1993 
and the first quarter of this year, more than 41,000 state-owned 
apartments and single-residence buildings passed into private 
ownership (11.1 percent of the total number of apartments in the 
state housing fund). Nearly 95 percent of these apartments 
(38,900) were privatized without payment, on preferential terms, 
or with compensation with vouchers for insufficient floor space. 
<H5>  ...As Is Unemployment and Crime </H5>
  On 1 April 1994, the number of registered jobless reached 
13,800 individuals, of whom 12,000 had unemployed status. Women 
account for more than 64 percent of those without work. Hidden 
unemployment--that is, those in the work force that are not 
fully employed--is not decreasing. In the oblast's industry 
alone, 87,000 persons did not work every day during the first 
quarter as a result of production stoppages. 
  In the first quarter of 1994, there were 5,800 reported 
crimes, or 21 percent more than in the first quarter of 1993. 
The crime rate rose in all regions of Ukraine, with the 
exception of Kirovohrad Oblast. The highest rises occurred in 
Volyn, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk, and Poltava 
Oblasts--by 40-23 percent. For Ukraine as a whole, the rate rose 
16 percent. 
  In Lvov Oblast, the crime rate increased in 18 rayons (with 
the exception of Kamyanka-Buzka and Peremyshlyany rayons) and in 
all cities under oblast jurisdiction, expect Boryslav. The rise 
has been especially significant in Drohobych (98 percent), 
Sambir (96 percent), Busk (95.5), Radekhiv (88.9 percent), 
Staryy Sambir (66 percent), and Zhovkva (63 percent) rayons. 
Every second crime falls into the serious category. There were 
427 group crimes, which is 33 percent more than during the 
preceding period. The authorities caught 2,213 individuals who 
committed crimes, or 24 percent more than last year. Among those 
charged, nearly half are able-bodied but unemployed and not 
attending any educational institution, every sixth is a minor, 
and every seventh was drunk at the time of committing the crime.

<F P=106> [Article by Olena Malynovska, candidate of historical </F>
sciences, chief specialist of the Ministry of Nationality and 
Immigration: "Migration: Who? Where? Why?" A footnote at the 
bottom of the first column of the article states: "This article 
is taken from POLITYKA I CHAS, the journal of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, which is about to appear (published 
in abridged form)."] 
  [Text] The process of population migration has 
intensified throughout the world. Recently, Ukraine has also 
been touched by the resettlement movement. The creation of new 
independent states on the territory of the former USSR has been 
accompanied by a significant exchange of populations among them. 
Thus, in 1992, for example, 775,000 people either entered 
Ukraine from other former Soviet republics or left for other 
former republics. In the first half of 1993, this figure 
exceeded 300,000. Nearly half the immigrants are Ukrainians. 
That is, there is an evident repatriation trend in connection 
with the creation of an independent Ukrainian state. 
  Until very recently, emigration from Ukraine in the 
form that it occurs throughout the world did not exist. The 
desire to change one's country of residence was regarded as 
treason. Apart from a small, often forced, political emigration, 
most of those leaving the country were members of specific 
ethnic groups--Jews and Germans--and only then if they had close 
relatives abroad. The scale of this emigration was small. 
<H5>  An Emigration Explosion and New Trends </H5>
  As departure was liberalized, emigration began to grow 
rapidly. Compared with 1987, when the departments of visas and 
registration [VVIR's] of the Ministry of Internal Affairs issued 
only 5,400 exit visas to citizens of Ukraine, permitting them to 
take up permanent residence abroad (among them, 3,000 exit visas 
to Israel), in 1989 they issued 36,500 visas, or nearly seven 
times as many. A record number of visas was issued in 
1990--73,000 (68,000 to Israel). In addition to parents, exit 
visas were processed for 22,000 children, raising the number of 
emigrants to more than 95,000 people. 
  In 1991, emigration from Ukraine dropped somewhat. The 
number 
of exit visas (counting children) issued was 69,300 (48,500 to 
Israel). A portion of these, as well as a portion of the visas 
issued during the preceding year, were not used. Emigration 
slowed down due to the "Gulf War" and the resulting rise in 
tensions in the international situation. As before, the majority 
of emigrants--70 percent--went to Israel. However, there was a 
substantial increase in emigration to the United States (15,300 
people, counting children) and to the Federal Republic of 
Germany (2,100). 
  New trends became more evident in 1992. The number of exit 
visas issued decreased to 35,200. Counting children, this number 
totalled 44,300. Of these, less than one-third headed for 
Israel, with the overwhelming majority going to the United 
States and Germany. 
  Based on official emigration statistics for the first half 
of 
1993, it is safe to conclude that the compass has now definitely 
swung to the West. Of the 19,700 persons who left the country 
during this period of time to take up permanent residence 
abroad, 45 percent headed for the United States and 11 percent 
for Germany. 
  Kievans make up the largest number--25 percent--of our 
former 
compatriots who now live in foreign countries. In the past, 
every fifth emigrant was from Odessa. A rather significant 
percentage of emigrants come from Kharkov, Dnipropetrovsk, 
Chernivtsi, and Zhytomyr Oblasts. Kirovohrad, Ternopil, and 
Poltava Oblasts have the lowest emigration rates. 
  Inasmuch as emigration from Ukraine in recent years was 
essentially ethnic in nature, it is quite natural that most 
emigrants left from regions with traditionally large Jewish 
populations. The Chernobyl catastrophe was another important 
factor that played an obvious role in the regional distribution 
of emigration. As already stated, departures to take up 
permanent residence abroad began to decrease in 1991. However, 
this trend applied mainly to regions outside the "Chernobyl 
zone." In fact, the number of those from Kiev and Kiev Oblast 
granted exit visas actually increased as compared with the 
preceding year, both in relative and absolute terms. 
  Current emigration from Ukraine to take up permanent 
residence abroad cannot be described as large. Clearly, the peak 
has been passed. The reserves of ethnic emigration are becoming 
exhausted. On the other hand, the Western countries that have 
become the ultimate destination of emigrants are constantly 
making entry for foreigners more difficult. It is easier to 
obtain permission for a temporary stay abroad, and, 
consequently, this kind of emigration is becoming more 
widespread. 
  A greater openness to the outside world in the second half 
of 
the eighties was manifested in, apart from other things, the 
opportunity that a significant number of people had to visit 
foreign countries on so-called personal business. 
  In 1992, the number of visas issued for temporary visits 
abroad fell somewhat and amounted to 1,808,000 (76 percent of 
these visas were granted for visits to Poland). The number of 
trips to the West remained rather modest. 
  The greatest number of trips for personal reasons are made 
by 
residents of the western border oblasts, where ties with 
neighboring countries are traditional and many residents have 
relatives abroad. 
<H5>  What They Are Looking For in Distant Lands </H5>
  To determine the nature of migration, it is important to 
know 
the reason for it. A portion of those who leave for a limited 
time do so to visit relatives, see a foreign country, or take a 
holiday. The majority, however, travel to engage in trade. One 
look at the baggage of our international passengers is enough to 
attest to this. More than half of those surveyed make regular 
commercial trips, primarily to Eastern European countries. In 
addition to such "petty traders," a certain portion of those who 
leave the country temporarily fall into the category of "migrant 
workers," that is, individuals who travel from one country to 
another according to the International Labor Organization in 
order to find work. 
  There has been a sharp rise in the number of business trips 
linked primarily to the expansion of economic and cultural 
cooperation with foreign partners and the growth of the number 
of people involved in such undertakings. But this is not the 
only consequence of this growth. In sending people on long-term 
assignments, Ukrainian enterprises often serve, in effect, as 
intermediaries for job placement abroad. 
  In the absence of any other forms of cooperation in the use 
of manpower resources, Ukrainian workers, such as construction 
laborers, for example, leave to work abroad under the guise of 
being sent to perform jobs outside the country by Ukrainian 
enterprises. Commercial firms that act as intermediaries in job 
placement abroad do so under the guise of sending people for 
training. Some educational institutions engage in the same 
practice. Yet another circumstance needs to be kept in mind. 
Official business trips and training are often used to find more 
or less permanent work and to sign a contract with a foreign 
employer. They thus serve as a means of emigrating to work 
abroad. Above all, this applies to highly qualified specialists. 
In one of his speeches, the president of the Academy of Sciences 
of Ukraine stated that two-thirds of the academy's scientists 
who have gone to other countries in recent years have signed 
contracts and extended their stay abroad. To a certain extent, 
tourism is also a step towards labor emigration. 
  To some degree, the "travel fever" that seized our society 
at 
the end of the eighties and the beginning of the nineties is a 
reaction to the fact that it was impossible to leave the country 
in earlier years. But there are also deeper reasons. First and 
foremost among them--a much lower living standard than in 
neighboring countries. 
  The country's deep economic crisis threatens not only the 
welfare of the population, but also its ability to find 
employment. Political issues also play a role. Up to now, 
Ukraine has remained a relatively calm region. However, the 
conflict in the Transdniester region, the difficult problems in 
Crimea, and the clashes with Russia that grow acute 
periodically--all produce a sense of uncertainty and the desire 
to leave and wait out this difficult period elsewhere. 
  Thus, Ukraine's citizens have plenty of reasons for wanting 
to emigrate. However, the effect of these factors would be 
weakened if the public mood were optimistic and there existed a 
firm belief that the situation would improve. Unfortunately, 
there are very evident signs of disillusionment and apathy. 
  At the end of 1992, the International Migration Organization 
conducted a survey of Ukraine's migration potential. 
  Among the Ukrainian citizens polled by the IMO 
[International 
Migration Organization], 49 percent were prepared to live abroad 
for a period ranging from several months to several years (44 
percent among Russian respondents) and 13 percent would emigrate 
permanently (8 percent among Russians). The IMO's experts found 
the following reasons cited by Ukrainian citizens for 
emigration: 71 percent--existing economic conditions, 33 
percent--the effects of Chernobyl, and 26 percent--concern for 
the health of their children, which is directly linked to the 
Chernobyl tragedy. Some optimism can be derived from the fact 
that ethnic and religious motives and human rights violations 
were cited as reasons for leaving the country by only 14.2 and 9 
percent of respondents, respectively (in Russia these numbers 
were 35.3 and 16 percent, respectively). 
  The majority of those surveyed would like to emigrate to 
Western European countries, while one-third would like to go to 
the United States or Canada. Worth noting is the small (6.3 
percent) but significant category of responses: "ready to leave 
for anywhere." 
  In general, the reasons given for wanting to leave were not 
unexpected. Three-quarters of those surveyed expressed 
dissatisfaction with their material living conditions. Material 
conditions were most important to older respondents, while young 
people showed less concern for them. However, young people 
attached great importance to what they perceived as a lack of 
opportunity to realize their potential. In third place among the 
main reasons cited by respondents for wanting to emigrate was 
concern for their children's future. In choosing life in a 
foreign country for their children, people reveal an extremely 
hopeless view of the future in their native country. That the 
political situation prompts people to emigrate was the view of 
17 percent of the respondents. National discrimination was cited 
by 3.8 percent. 
<H5>  Obstacles and Projections </H5>
  At the same time, statistical data indicate that the rapid 
rise in emigration seen at the end of the eighties has halted. 
The number of emigrants, although large, remains stable, or may 
even be dropping. Clearly, the flood of emigrants that the West 
feared so much never came. 
  Why is this so? The state poses no obstacles to emigration. 
Following the passage in January 1994 of the Law on the 
Procedure for Leaving and Entering Ukraine by Citizens of 
Ukraine, freedom of movement across the state border was secured 
by law. However, the economic crisis and the decline in the 
living standard, which are the principal reasons for people 
wanting to leave, paradoxically also serve as an obstacle to 
fulfilling this desire. Of the citizens who answered our 
questionnaire, 67.7 percent stated that they lacked the 
financial means to leave the country. 
  External factors pose more serious obstacles to Ukrainians 
wishing to depart for the West. Both the authorities and the 
citizenry in the West are strongly opposed to an increase in the 
number of foreigners in their countries. 
  Taking into account both internal and external factors, 
certain assumptions can be made regarding the development of the 
process of emigration from Ukraine in the near future. The 
number of people leaving to settle permanently elsewhere will 
slowly decrease. The predominant destinations will be countries 
that have been the traditional recipients of immigrants--the 
United States, Canada, Australia, and a few others, while the 
scale of emigration will depend on the immigration policies of 
Western countries. As it loses its ethnic nature, emigration 
will assume the distinct characteristics of emigration for 
economic reasons. 
  Based on the experience of other countries, it is possible 
to 
forecast a certain scenario for the development of a labor 
emigration. During the first phase (we are in the midst of it 
now), most migrants are highly skilled specialists, scientists, 
artists, and sportsmen--in other words, mainly people with a 
higher education who have attained recognition and success in 
their professions and who range in age from 30 to 40. A second 
group is made up of young people, predominantly males without 
families, who have neither the necessary education nor skills 
that would assure them permanent employment. They are either 
enterprising and restless adventurers or individuals who find 
themselves in extremely difficult circumstances. 
  In the second phase, when the positive results of emigration 
become evident in the material circumstances of those who have 
emigrated, when Ukrainian immigrants have won a certain degree 
of respect from their employers, found their "niche" in the job 
market, have established themselves in the receiving country, 
and are able to offer support to their newly arriving 
compatriots, wider segments of the population will join the 
migratory movement. They will come from various social and age 
groups, and the proportion of women and people with families 
will grow. If no serious external and internal obstacles to 
migration for the purpose of finding work in other countries 
emerge, labor emigration will reach mass proportions. 
  There are certain factors that provide Ukrainian citizens 
with opportunities to find jobs abroad. To begin with, the 
Ukrainian labor force is quite well-trained, educated and 
cultured, and extremely cheap and undemanding. Migrants from 
Ukraine are closer to Europeans and North Americans in terms of 
cultural and religious traditions, and it is easier for them to 
integrate into Western society than, for example, for Asians or 
Africans. Of some significance is the presence in the West of a 
rather large Ukrainian diaspora. 
  Chances for finding work will be better in less developed 
and 
less rich distant lands, which need for their development not 
only specialists but also people who simply have an education. 
These may be Latin American countries, which have already shown 
their willingness under certain circumstances to admit a 
significant number of migrants from Eastern Europe to work in 
certain sectors and regions, the countries of Southeast Asia, or 
oil-producing Arab countries. 
  Substantial numbers of migrants are already working in 
countries that are neighbors to Ukraine. 
<H5>  What About the State? </H5>
  The growth of a labor emigration from Ukraine, as well as 
where these emigrants go and the results that this migration 
produces, will depend to a large extent on the state's position 
on this issue and on the development and implementation of its 
migration policy. At first glance, it may seem that any action 
taken by the state to present its citizens in the international 
job market will promote increased emigration and thus harm the 
interests of the state. This is not so, however. To be sure, 
there is a danger that migration will lead to a loss of a 
portion of our labor force, indeed the best portion--the most 
qualified, young, and enterprising individuals. At the same 
time, however, emigration can bring our country certain 
benefits. First and foremost, emigrants are a source of hard 
currency. The amount of money sent back by emigrants in some 
countries exceeds revenues from external economic activity. 
Secondly, emigration offers an opportunity to acquire valuable 
production experience, learn new technologies, and raise the 
general cultural level. Thirdly, it serves as a means of 
building better understanding between countries. Most important, 
a temporary labor emigration is a serious alternative to 
permanent emigration. The opportunity to work abroad for a 
certain period of time and to return home with some savings, 
thereby improving the material circumstances of their families, 
may help to change people's minds about leaving permanently. 
  When the emigration process intensifies, the role of the 
state as regards those of its citizens who live abroad grows. 
Our survey has shown that myths about the great opportunities 
available to migrants are still very widespread in our society. 
Of those surveyed, many (40 percent) link their hopes for 
success abroad with the opportunities offered by the receiving 
countries. Knowledge about the real state of affairs abroad is 
very limited. 
  It is up to the state to provide its citizens with accurate 
information about living conditions and job opportunities in 
foreign countries. It would make sense for the state to take on 
the function of acting as an intermediary in finding jobs for 
its citizens abroad. This would enable it to protect both the 
interests of the state and the personal interests of migrants 
and to regulate labor emigration. 
  Such measures would protect Ukrainian citizens from the very 
real danger of finding themselves at the lowest rung of the 
social and professional scale in a foreign country. Another 
important aspect of protecting Ukrainian citizens abroad is 
through the regulation of the status of emigrants on the 
international level. 
  In the course of developing and implementing its migration 
policy, Ukraine will not be able to avoid becoming a party to 
multilateral legal acts relating to migrants or avoid taking 
part in the work of the International Migration Organization. 
Another important aspect of developing a migration policy 
entails concluding bilateral agreements with respect to the 
conditions of residence and work of Ukrainian citizens in the 
countries that admit them. 
  The establishment of a reliable legal foundation on which to 
regulate migration and emigration processes is one of the 
components of state building in Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roman Shpek, by Viktor Tkachuk for UPresA </F>
[Ukrainian Press Agency]; place and date not given: "Roman 
Shpek: 'There Are Two Mysteries That I Cannot Comprehend--The 
Mystery of the Immaculate Conception and That of a Budget 
Without a Deficit....'"] 
  [Text] 
  [UPresA] At a meeting with journalists, Yukhym Zvyahilskyy 
talked about the decrease in the inflation rate. Just how was 
this achieved? 
  [Shpek] By a restrictive credit policy on the part of the 
National Bank and the government. 
  [UPresA] Do you mean the nonpayment of wages? 
  [Shpek] No, that is another factor entirely. Even those 
credits that went to the producers were transferred to Special 
Account 726, where they served the purpose of moving goods 
through the system; but they could not be instantly transferred 
to dispersal accounts and paid out as wages. The decrease in the 
inflation rate is merely one of the factors attesting to the 
state of our economy. We achieved it at a very dear price--by a 
decline in production. Moreover, the decline in production was 
influenced not only by the National Bank's restrictive policy, 
but also by the reduction in demand for goods in the domestic 
market. First and foremost, this refers to a decline in the 
population's purchasing power and a reduction in the demand from 
enterprises. But I am profoundly convinced that unless we 
disconnect the state's finances from those of enterprises, we 
will not be able to overcome our economic crisis. You must know 
and understand that nowadays--for some reason--we are saying the 
following: "Let the National Bank emit more money!" But now let 
us thoroughly analyze the state of affairs in those enterprises 
that are presently operating under the conditions of freedom 
from the ministry's controls. One enterprise has turned out a 
product and set a price on it, taking inflation into account, 
and it wants to pay its people good wages. This enterprise "A" 
has delivered its products to another enterprise "B," but the 
latter has no money to pay for them, and the debts between them 
increase. And this too is a modest-sized emission center. But 
enterprises are really property owned by the state, and--if not 
today, then tomorrow--the state will bear responsibility for 
them. 
  [UPresA] Are you alluding to bankruptcy? 
  [Shpek] Unfortunately, yes. But bankruptcy is not the end of 
the world; it is simply a matter of changing owners. If we 
disconnect the finances of the state and those of enterprises, 
then even under state ownership (a joint-stock company wherein 
the controlling bloc of shares is possessed by the state), the 
leading officials will think carefully about what expenditures 
can be undertaken. And if the enterprise in question should burn 
down, it could still settle its accounts by means of the 
mortgage deposit or by that portion of the property that could 
still be sold. 
  [UPresA] On 4 May, a government directive was issued on the 
matter of preparing reforms in the tax system. What steps have 
already been taken in this sector? 
  [Shpek] A discussion is now taking place with regard to 
cutting the excise tax. Our tax policy must be such that 
something flows into the budget, or else no revenues would be 
formed for expenditures. But it must not strangle the producer. 
Why is the excise tax being looked at hard for possible cuts? 
Because the level of production in the alcoholic-beverage 
industry fell by 63 percent during the first quarter. A group of 
experts is working on a new concept for our tax policy. 
Certainly the value-added tax will also be reviewed. In general, 
we must determine and designate just what this value added shall 
be. We must introduce taxes on land, on fixed capital, and on 
the population's income. But we do not yet have a system for 
tracking the population's income. And certainly wages are not a 
complete measure of income. Nor should we consider that the 
state simply wants to take things away from people. It is 
possible that if people's incomes were sufficient, then we would 
not have to give them reduced rates for electric power, free 
textbooks, and so on. 
  [UPresA] But how is this tax review to be done in a 
practical 
sense? Because, of course, the revenues and expenditures have 
already been approved; and the budget as a whole has been 
approved without a deficit. The same VAT [value-added tax] that 
you mentioned is the budget's largest revenue-producing item.... 
  [Shpek] I have worked very hard to improve myself, but there 
are still two things that I cannot comprehend--two mysteries 
which are wrapped in an enigma. They are the mystery of the 
Immaculate Conception and a budget without a deficit. 
  [UPresA] But why, then, was it accepted and approved this 
time? 
  [Shpek] That is already another matter. The problem lies not 
in the high inflation rate per se, but rather in the ability to 
live under the conditions of a high inflation rate. People have 
to calculate their earnings ahead of time, and enterprises must 
learn how to take inflation into account. The same thing is true 
at the state level. The situation certainly would not have been 
so difficult if the prices on gas had been changed as soon as 
they were changed in Russia. If the prices on coal in October 
1993 had been changed by a factor of 2.3, then--beginning on 1 
January 1994--they would have risen by a factor of only 5.7. 
  [UPresA] Why is it that certain signs of reform are 
beginning 
to appear at precisely this time? Is this a kind of tribute to 
the political situation wherein the government may--possibly--be 
changed or even replaced by the new parliament? 
  [Shpek] No, this is not the result of the pressure of 
circumstances. It is simply that the government has returned to 
a former proposal made by the Ministry of the Economy. We 
introduced this proposal and such lessons when the draft of the 
1994 Plan was already being worked out. But these ideas were 
rejected at that time. Practical life, however, has demonstrated 
the necessity of taking such steps. They will be taken not 
because somebody wants to look good, but rather because this is 
what the economy demands. 
  [UPresA] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Lakiza-Sachuk, candidate of economic </F>
sciences, under the rubric "Front-Page Topic"; abbreviated 
version of an article published in the magazine of the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine POLITYKA I CHAS No. 4 and released 
concurrently: "Will We Go the Way of the Dinosaur?"] 
  [Text] The demographic development of Ukraine is one 
of the components of its national security, just like in any 
other state. It is precisely such development that determines 
the quantitative and qualitative parameters of the population, 
its ability to ensure the regular operation of society, the 
preservation of its defense capability at the proper level, and 
the laying of a foundation for further upward movement. 
  In present-day Ukraine, the demographic situation is 
shaped by key factors such as the new geopolitical situation, 
social strains, an economic depression, and a decline in the 
standard of living. 
<H5>  A Group Portrait With a Beggar's Sack </H5>
  An analysis of the current demographic situation, as well as 
its dynamics in recent years indicates that along with economic 
and political problems, Ukraine has come face to face with a 
major demographic crisis. Unlike the economic and political 
crises, the demographic crisis has greater inertia, is lengthier 
in terms of time, and is hard to manage. This may have 
far-reaching unfavorable consequences. 
  Compared to the main indicators of the natural movement of 
the population in the world--levels of the birth rate, death 
rate, and natural increment of the population--Ukraine has 
tended to get increasingly worse rankings. In terms of the level 
of its birth rate (10.8 per 1,000 inhabitants) it ranks last 
among the former republics of the USSR; in terms of the death 
rate of the population (12.3 per 1,000 inhabitants), it ranks 
second among the developed countries of the world; in terms of 
infant mortality (14 percent), it ranks 17th among all countries 
of the world, and on the indicator of the average life 
expectancy of the population, it is 47th in the world. 
  For regular reproduction of the population--in the 
socioeconomic conditions of developed countries, that is--the 
minimally expanded reproduction of the population requires that 
each woman give birth to 2.2-2.4 children in her lifetime. In 
1992, this level in Ukraine came to 1.8 (in the cities, 1.5) 
children. The refraining of families from having the second or 
third child has been observed under the conditions of a lack of 
certainty in the coming day and unfavorable sociopolitical and 
economic prospects. 
  Only the use of family planning measures, to be sure as 
uncivilized as abortions, may be considered to be a progressive 
aspect of this process of restricting births. Abortions have 
consequences so unfavorable as to call into doubt the very 
survival of the people. 
  The number of marriages has dropped recently, and the number 
of divorces has gone up. For the most part, marriages that have 
existed for less than five years are those that are dissolved. 
Every year, more than 150,000 children are left without one of 
the parents as a result of divorces. 
  A reduction in the average size of the family in both urban 
and rural areas has also become a leading tendency in the 
transformation of families in recent decades. 
  In recent years, the absolute and relative indicators of the 
death rate of the population have been steadily growing in 
Ukraine. Compared to 1990, the death rate in 1993 increased by 
15 percent. An increase in elderly individuals in the population 
is a determining factor in this. Their proportion in Ukraine 
came to 21.9 percent in 1992. 
  The so-called "surplus death rate" of men, which has been 
registered in all developed countries in recent decades, has 
greatly influenced the growth of the general death rate 
coefficient. 
  In the 1970's and 1980's, a stable downward trend in deaths 
due to diseases of the cardiovascular system, the respiratory 
organs, stomach ulcers, and liver diseases was registered in 
Ukraine, whereas in the first half of 1993, compared to the same 
period of 1992, we can find a growth in the number of deaths for 
almost all of the reasons. In all of this, for example, the 
growth in deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases is in 
itself shameful for a civilized country. The death rate from 
tuberculosis, which is on the rise in Ukraine, exceeds 
corresponding levels, for example, in neighboring Poland, by two 
to nine times. 
  Among the reasons for the growth of the death rate that are 
relatively new for the population of Ukraine, the reasons that 
dominate, to our mind, are due to factors of social strains. The 
number of persons killed increased in 1992 compared to 1991 (by 
28 percent), as well as the number of persons who died of 
alcohol poisoning (by 21 percent) and suicides (by 10 percent). 
  The dying-off of the most vulnerable groups of the 
population--the elderly, women, and children--is on the rise. 
  The health of the population is one of the prerequisites for 
shaping the level, structure, and quality of the reproduction of 
the population. A paradoxical picture has emerged in the course 
of researching changes in this factor. As a result of 
improvements in the prevention and treatment of disease, as well 
as the accomplishments in reducing the death rate of the 
population, the proportion of chronic and degenerative diseases 
has increased, which on the whole worsened the general health 
condition of the population. 
  The total incidence of disease in Ukraine is one of the 
highest among the republics of the former Soviet Union, and so 
is the incidence of social diseases. Thus, Ukraine ranks second 
in the above group of countries in terms of the prevalence of 
alcoholism and drug addiction. The abuse of tobacco products 
also gives rise to concern. 
<H5>  Attention: The Genetic Pool! </H5>
  Losses to the genetic pool of the population of Ukraine are 
a 
factor in the deterioration of the base for the subsequent 
reproduction of the population. Negative changes in the genetic 
pool are becoming more conspicuous, which may result in the 
qualitative degeneration of the Ukrainian people. The genocide 
of the Ukrainian people in Soviet times was manifested in the 
planned destruction of the best educated and professionally 
trained segment of the population of Ukraine, its intelligentsia 
and rural working people, in the course of political repression 
in the 1930's-1950's and the famines of the 1920's and 1930's. 
The great loss of the population during World War II, as well as 
the organized resettlement of Ukrainians, dealt appreciable 
blows. At present, we are witnessing a "brain drain" to foreign 
countries. All of this has harmed, and continues to harm the 
Ukrainian nation, in many cases irreparably. 
  An analysis of the current situation indicates the 
following: 
In conjunction with the deterioration of the external social and 
natural environment, individuals whose physical health is good 
retain the real ability to survive and leave behind their 
progeny. Therefore, the factor of physical development is coming 
to prevail over intellectual development. 
  Data on a trend toward considerable deterioration in the 
health of present-day children and adolescents is an indirect 
qualitative confirmation of this hypothesis (since no statistics 
on genetic diseases are collected in Ukraine). When coming to 
school, only one in eight to 10 children is healthy, and when 
graduating from school--only one in 20. Therefore, we can 
already assume at present what qualitative characteristics they 
are going to pass on to their children. 
  In addition, the technologically induced global pollution of 
the atmosphere, soil, and water in most oblasts of Ukraine has 
been causing frequent mutation damage to genes that, in the long 
term, tends to grow exponentially. 
  Unfortunately, the Chernobyl disaster has had considerable 
influence on the deterioration of the current demographic 
situation and prospects for the reproduction of the population 
of Ukraine. As a result of the accident, the course of 
demographic processes has been disrupted, and the manifestation 
of unfavorable tendencies in these processes accelerated. On the 
whole, 1.5 million residents of Ukraine, including over 90,000 
children, were among individuals afflicted by the Chernobyl 
disaster as of the end of 1992. 
  State programs for the resettlement of residents from the 
territories contaminated as a result of the accident are not 
being carried out. The number of resettled persons has barely 
exceeded 10 percent of the planned number. 
<H5>  "Harmony" of Poverty and Richness </H5>
  The speed with which a majority of the citizens of Ukraine 
are being reduced to poverty and the reality of prospects for 
mass unemployment against the background of decay in the system 
of social protection may cause powerful explosions of popular 
discontent. 
  Such problems give grounds for concern about prospects for 
the development of the entire multinational population residing 
in the territory of Ukraine. However, problems of the existence 
and reproduction of the titular population of the state, the 
Ukrainians, cause particular concern. 
  For a long time, the number of residents of Ukraine who were 
registered by census as Ukrainians was artificially reduced, 
whereas the number of individuals of non-Ukrainian nationality 
increased. Being of Ukrainian ancestry of long duration, a 
majority of those who called themselves Russians at census time 
did so under the pressure of existing social circumstances, in 
order to accommodate public opinion afflicted with chauvinism. 
Thus, between the last censuses of 1970 and 1989, the proportion 
of Ukrainians fell by 2.5 percent, and the proportion of those 
calling themselves Russians increased by almost 3 percent. 
  Simultaneously with a decrease in the number of individuals 
who identified themselves as Ukrainians, a decrease occurred in 
the proportion of the population that called Ukrainian its 
native language. Meanwhile, as is known, language affiliation 
shapes many aspects of ethnic mentality. 
  In this manner, objective conditions for the existence of 
the 
Ukrainian population were eliminated, and the sphere of its 
national self-awareness and self-reproduction was artificially 
restricted. 
  While a shortage of highly skilled cadres in Ukraine is 
comprehensive, a particular shortage of specialist-Ukrainians is 
felt. Of each 1,000 Jews, 358 have a college education, 
Russians--158, and Ukrainians--only 85, that is, two to four 
times fewer. This gap is particularly apparent in rural areas 
where it comes to a factor of six. At the same time, the poor 
representation of Ukrainians in spheres that are associated with 
intellectual work and their considerable preponderance in areas 
where manual work is needed are noteworthy in the course of the 
analysis of spheres of activity. 
<H5>  Demography and Security </H5>
  As we analyze the current status and prospects for the 
development of the ethnic breakdown of the population of 
Ukraine, it is necessary to stress that various ethnic groups 
reproduce their numbers in different ways--they have different 
natality, mortality, life expectancy indicators, and so on. This 
may influence substantially the strength of particular ethnic 
groups in the country and mutual relations between them. Thus, 
current statistics indicate higher birth rate indicators among 
the Russian and Moldovan population than among the Ukrainians 
and the particular preponderance of reproductive indicators of 
the representatives of Caucasian and Central Asian countries 
(former republics of the USSR) whose migration to Ukraine has 
been extremely intensive recently. 
  The influx to Ukraine of individuals of nonindigenous ethnic 
groups holding radically different religious, ethnic, and 
ethical views has intensified, which increases the likelihood of 
the development of additional social strains. Historic justice 
is being restored with regard to the nations subjected to 
reprisals that previously resided in the territory of Ukraine 
itself: The Crimean Tatars, the Krymchaks, and so on are 
returning to the locations of their permanent residence. In 
conjunction with this, open or hidden confrontations between the 
local and newly arriving populations may develop at the 
locations to which these nations return, as well as in locations 
densely settled by refugees and forced migrants. 
  At the same time, manifestations of the ethnic 
self-awareness 
of Ukrainians are perceived by a certain segment of the 
representatives of non-Ukrainian nationalities as a chauvinistic 
and nationalistic position. In particular, this is the case with 
the language. However, these attacks are groundless. We can 
state that, say, Russians always had a greater number of schools 
with instruction in the Russian language and Russian-language 
printed publications. 
  The revival of national culture and religion is underway 
among the rest of the national minorities. Under the 
circumstances, the issue of the revival and development of the 
Ukrainian ethnic entity that accounts for three-quarters of the 
entire population should also become one of the leading 
directions of the state ethnic policy of Ukraine. 
  The consequences of the demographic crisis that Ukraine is 
now going through are far-reaching and diverse in nature. The 
quantity and quality of the ethnic Ukrainian population suffers 
losses that in combination affect the overall prospects for the 
stable and secure development of the state. 
  As the developmental experience of some countries indicates, 
the implementation of a particular demographic policy can bring 
to power or topple governments, divide societies, and serve as 
an indicator of the development of democracy in them. Therefore, 
it becomes necessary to distinguish and thoroughly study a 
special block of demographic factors and processes of the stable 
and secure development of the country. 
  In the environment of independent development, the 
aforementioned signs of a demographic crisis that is mounting in 
our country give grounds to state that survival at any price, 
including in the demographic sense, rather than development is 
the main national interest on which the strategy and tactics of 
the policy of national security of Ukraine should draw. After 
all, without the preservation and survival of the Ukrainian 
nation, of which the national population is the nucleus, it will 
become impossible to build the Ukrainian state, and ensuring its 
national security will have no future.

<F P=106> [Article by Elvira Sabadash: "Why Are People Dying Younger?"] </F>
  [Text] I can remember when I was a little girl, how happy I 
was upon seeing in a newspaper a report about somebody with a 
long life span, either in our country or in another country. 
Nowadays there are almost no such reports here. On the contrary, 
our scientists issue such disturbing forecasts as the following: 
Unless the economic situation is stabilized, the people's 
prosperity rises, and the ecology is improved, by the year 2005 
the average life span in Ukraine will be as follows: for 
men--69.5 years; for women--75.8 years. 
  The Social Gerontology Laboratory within the Gerontology 
Institute of the Ukrainian Academy of Medical Sciences is 
studying many matters pertaining to the able-bodied, working 
population, as well as to persons of pension age: developing a 
system of medical-social assistance, granting social support, 
problems of hygiene and nutrition, along with analyzing the 
death rate and its cause at the present time in relation to the 
development of our society. As noted by Yevheniya Cherkaska, a 
prominent scientific staff associate at this laboratory, the 
pace of a civilization's development is in and of itself the 
greatest influence on the increase or decrease of the death rate 
of its population. The developed countries--for example, the 
United States, Canada, Switzerland, Spain, Iceland, Hong 
Kong--have growth coefficients in their death rates that are 
less than those in the countries that were engaged in building 
socialism over the course of many years. 
  The following conclusion suggests itself: The so-called 
planned economic system is not interested in maintaining the 
health of its able-bodied population at the proper level, 
whereas, in the case of a market-type system, just the opposite 
is true. Private ownership of the means of production accords 
people the possibility of working normally, as well as being 
morally and materially dependent not on society, but rather on a 
specific person--the director of an enterprise. The latter 
endeavors to do everything possible to make sure that those 
persons subordinate to him work diligently, but without harm or 
injury to their health. 
  Our society, unfortunately, actively endeavors to take 
advantage of cheap manpower at its production facilities. It 
operates in accordance with the following principle: Healthy 
persons can and should work at the hard jobs, while absolutely 
everybody else should work at the easy ones. There is, in 
effect, the so-called selection by level of health: A person 
must conform and adjust to his production facility, and it seems 
that it is cheaper for the state to pay for prescriptions than 
to provide normal working conditions. As a result of this, 
persons who have worked at harmful production facilities for 
approximately 10 years remain ill for the entire remainder of 
their lives; and such persons also have diseased children.... 
The age indicator of the labor force is likewise particularly 
important here. Let us bear in mind that harmful production 
facilities require young, strong, and healthy persons; 
otherwise, they could not endure such conditions. Nowadays, the 
younger generation's quality of health is becoming worse, while 
the requirements of our production facilities are becoming 
continually harsher. Healthy, strong persons are frequently 
lured to ecologically dirty production facilities with the aid 
of all kinds of privileges. Because of this, the best examples 
of the population are artificially winnowed out, and the number 
of the healthiest members of our population is decreasing. 
Incidentally, the probability of death among Ukrainians is 1.5 
times as high as it is among Frenchmen, and almost twice that 
among Japanese. 
  According to data provided by the Ministry of Statistics, 
the 
birth rate in Ukraine during the years 1991 through 1992 alone 
declined by 5 percent. One of the reasons for this was a 
decrease in the number of marriages and an increase in the 
number of divorces. But the chief cause was the rise in the 
death rate. Beginning in 1980, the overall death rate of our 
population has grown continually. Whereas in the year mentioned 
it equalled 11.4 percent of deaths per 1,000 of population, in 
1992 this figure amounted to 13.14 percent. The rise in the 
death rate is occurring in virtually all age groups, including 
among children up to four years of age. During the years 
1991-1992 the death rate increased with particular rapidity, due 
to diseases of the blood and those of the blood-producing 
organs, as well as from serious mental disorders. Does this not 
provide grounds for the spreading opinion that Ukraine's human 
population is beginning to die out? But the scientists argue 
convincingly that this is not the case at all. To a certain 
extent, this is a result of the fact that during the 1960's, the 
level of the birth rate was very low, and, therefore, now that 
20 or 30 years have elapsed, the number of persons in their 
child-bearing years is somewhat smaller than normal. 
  Be that as it may, the demographic situation is extremely 
unfavorable. Moreover, this is aggravated by economic 
instability and by uncertainty regarding the future. In 
1991--for the first time in recent decades--a negative 
population growth was registered here. Our country's population 
declined by 39,000, and in 1992 it declined by another 100,000 
persons. According to the data provided by the Social 
Gerontology Laboratory, the causes of changes in the death rate 
are diverse and varied: Such factors as place of residence, 
occupation, age, level of social security, and ecology are all 
important in this matter. 
  Ecology is so important that it is worthwhile dwelling on it 
in greater detail here. It has an essential influence on the 
death rate and the incidence of disease among the population. It 
is difficult to find anywhere at all such enclosed, ecologically 
harmful production facilities as are present in Ukraine. They 
include chemical and coal-tar chemical production facilities, 
construction, metallurgical, and machine-building industries, 
the excessive use of chemicals in agriculture, and--in addition 
to all that--there is Chernobyl. Especially characteristic in 
this regard is the southern region, where the lifespan is 
shorter as compared with other localities (it is shortest in 
Odessa Oblast, where it amounts to 67 years). To a considerable 
extent, this is a consequence of polluting the Dnieper River 
with chemicals and with the salts of heavy metals. This water is 
utilized for drinking and for irrigating the fields, thus 
adding--time and time again--a new portion of fats and 
pesticides. The inhabitants of Ternopol Oblast are the 
longest-lived in our country (with a span of almost 71 years), 
and--on the whole--life is the longest in our country's western 
regions. The death rate rises as one moves from West to East and 
from North to South; but it should be noted that in the midst of 
certain regions the variations are quite great among the 
different oblasts. 
  Moreover, Chernobyl is far from being insignificant in its 
contribution to this matter. According to the computations made 
by specialists in those localities that were marked by intensive 
contamination by radiation, the death rate from cancer-type 
diseases will be on the rise during the next 15-20 years.... And 
so the forecasts by specialists--medical personnel and 
scientists--who have been studying the problems of the lifespan 
and the causes of death among Ukraine's population are 
disturbing. Present-day living conditions, including 
socioeconomic, climatic, geographical, and ecological factors, 
as well as the state of medical assistance benefits, does not 
enable us to term our people healthy. Specific forecasts as to 
the development of this situation in the future are simply 
impossible. Ukraine's economic indicators are almost unknown, 
and nobody has undertaken the task of predicting the state of 
the economy for the immediate future. However, taking into 
account the inertia in the development of demographic 
processes--along with certain domestic principles--it may be 
assumed that the decrease in the lifespan and the increase in 
the death rate of the population will be maintained for another 
two or three years, even provided that the socioeconomic 
situation is stabilized. The situation could appear to be stable 
but actually be getting worse, unless measures are implemented 
with regard to enhancing the people's well-being, providing 
normal medical treatment to cure people, and improving the 
ecological situation. 
  But meanwhile, according to the scientists' forecasts, in 
Ukraine the average lifespan in the year 2010 will be 67.1 years 
for men and 76 years for women, despite the fact that in the 
developed countries--for example, in Japan--it had already 
amounted to the following figures during the years 1989-1990: 76 
years for men and 82 years for women. This too will give the 
deputies to our newly formed parliament something to think about.

<F P=106> [Article by Mykhaylo Protsiv: "May Variations in Food </F>
Prices"] 
  [Text] The Press Service of the Ukrainian Ministry of the 
Economy has recently divulged and circulated information 
that--contrary to all rumors--no successive rise in prices and 
rates is foreseen on consumer goods for the May-June period. On 
the contrary, the government's endeavors with regard to economic 
stabilization have led to a tangible reduction in the rate of 
inflation. 
  But, just what is the actual situation? Take rye bread, for 
example. In Lvov, on 14 April, a loaf cost 3,767 karbovantsy; 
whereas, on 17 May, a customer already had to pay 4,680 
karbovantsy for a loaf of such bread in a state store. Wheat 
bread has also become more expensive in Lvov. For example, a 
loaf baked with top-grade flour on that same day cost 4,418 
karbovantsy, that is, almost 1,000 karbovantsy more than it had 
a month before. To be sure, the price of wheat bread also rose 
by 63 karbovantsy in Ivano-Frankovsk. But, here the price of rye 
bread is only about half that paid for such a loaf in 
Lvov--2,556 karbovantsy In Kharkov, the price of rye bread has 
been stable for a long time at 2,018 karbovantsy a loaf, whereas 
wheat bread made with top-grade flour costs 2,564 karbovantsy a 
loaf. Incidentally, the cheapest vermicelli here is made of 
wheat using refined, white flour. One kilogram of this product 
costs 6,840 karbovantsy, while in Ivano-Frankovsk, Rovno, and 
Lvov a customer has to pay 9,170, 10,109, and 10,600 karbovantsy 
respectively. 
  Whereas, during April, the prices of fresh beef and pork 
declined, in May we are observing the reverse process. Only in 
Ivano-Frankovsk the price of beef went down by 1,200 
karbovantsy, and it cost 26,180 karbovantsy on 17 May of this 
year. The cheapest meat in this category--as of the day 
before--was in Lvov--where it cost 25,000 karbovantsy per 
kilogram; and the most expensive was in Kharkov, where a 
kilogram cost 31,280 karbovantsy. For some obscure reason, the 
prices on pork after Easter jumped sharply upward in the stores 
of all the above-mentioned cities. In most cases, this price 
rise was in the range of 2,000 karbovantsy per kilogram, and in 
Ivano-Frankovsk it amounted to an immediate jump of almost 7,000 
coupons. Here a customer has to pay 50,300 karbovantsy for 1 kg 
of pork, whereas the prices in Lvov and Rovno are 46,000 and 
44,566 karbovantsy per kg, respectively. 
  Sausage-type products have likewise risen in price. The most 
expensive is top-quality boiled sausage in Lvov, where it costs 
60,400 karbovantsy per kg, whereas the cheapest price for such 
an item is in Rovno, where it costs 47,632 karbovantsy per kg. 
  With regard to milk, during the last few years, the prices 
on 
it have stabilized somewhat. In Rovno, Lvov, and 
Ivano-Frankovsk, the price of a liter has remained around 3,418, 
3,450, and 2,910 karbovantsy, respectively. In Kharkov's state 
trade network, a customer has to pay 1,000 karbovantsy less per 
liter than in April, that is, 3,388 karbovantsy 
  Sour cream is most expensive in Lvov, although its price has 
not risen; and it cost 21,970 karbovantsy per kg on 17 May, 
whereas in Ivano-Frankovsk this product is the cheapest of the 
above-mentioned cities--costing 16,260 karbovantsy per kg. 
  Those inhabitants of Lvov who are fond of creamery butter 
are 
in for a pleasant surprise because they will be enjoying 1 kg of 
this product at a price that is 10,000 coupons cheaper than the 
inhabitants of the cities of Rovno, Kharkov, and 
Ivano-Frankovsk. However, 10 eggs cost 15,000 karbovantsy in 
Lvov, whereas in neighboring Ivano-Frankovsk the price is 13,260 
karbovantsy (could it be that in the mountains the hens have 
begun to lay eggs faster?). To be sure, the situation with 
regard to gingerbread cookies is more difficult for inhabitants 
of the Sub-Carpathian regions because--in contrast to the other 
cities--the price on such items is rising. One kilogram of these 
products here costs 15,446 karbovantsy, whereas in Kharkov the 
price is 10,688 karbovantsy. Somebody is obviously luring 
Kharkov's inhabitants into their snares with these sweet bakery 
items. By the way, berry-type candies are also quite cheap here. 
In Lvov a customer must pay 39,900 karbovantsy for a kg of these 
sweets, while in Kharkov the price is 28,384 karbovantsy per kg. 
  Just as a month ago, the cheapest potatoes are to be found 
in 
Ivano-Frankovsk, where 1 kg costs 982 coupons. In Kharkov a 
potato--although slightly less expensive--on 17 May could be 
bought for 2,712 karbovantsy. In Lvov this product has become 
more expensive and is now in the price range of 2,000 
karbovantsy. 
  With regard to prices at farmers' markets, beef prices have 
gone up in Lvov by 10,000, in Rovno--by 2,500, and in 
Ivano-Frankovsk--by 6,000 karbovantsy per kg. But this meat is 
most expensive in Kharkov, where it costs 54,000 karbovantsy per 
kilogram, although its price has remained unchanged during this 
past month. Pigs and poultry have become tangibly more expensive 
in the market place. For one speckled hen, a customer must pay 
100,000 coupons in Lvov, in Rovno--120,000, in Kharkov--143,333, 
and in Ivano-Frankovsk--120,000 coupons. 
  As compared to April, the following items have become 
cheaper 
in the farmers' markets: milk, sour cream, homemade butter, and 
vegetable oil. At the same time, however, prices charged for 
onions and garlic have gone up sharply. In April, a kilogram of 
turnips cost 25,833 coupons, for example, in Kharkov, whereas 
now it costs 66,260. In Lvov and Rovno, its price is 40,000 
karbovantsy. Moreover, in Lvov garlic has reached a record 
high--150,000 karbovantsy per kg. In Kharkov, they are asking 
115,000 karbovantsy, in Ivano-Frankovsk--90,000, and in 
Rovno--60,000 karbovantsy per kg of this product. 
  Therefore, prices on products both in state stores and in 
farmers' markets are going up sharply in some respects, while 
they are marking time in others. It is difficult to say what 
lies ahead for us, but the so-called food basket of most 
Ukrainian citizens until the next autumn harvest (May God grant 
that there is one!) will remain half empty and quite monotonous 
as to variety.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Volkovskyy by V. Maevskyy; place </F>
and date not given: "We Now Have a Holding Company!"] 
  [Text] A regulation was recently adopted on 
joint-stock holding companies, and, on 16 May, Anatoliy 
Volkovskyy was appointed chairman of the board of Ukrresoursy 
State Holding Company. A PRAVDA UKRAINY correspondent met with 
the new executive and first of all asked: 
  [Maevskyy] Anatoliy Filippovich, you will have to pardon us 
but neither the masses of workers nor I know what a holding 
company is. 
  [Volkovskyy] A holding company is an association of 
joint-stock companies that owns a controlling package of stock 
in each member of that association. Let us say the ministry is a 
purely state organization, while a state holding company 
includes not only state enterprises, but also joint-stock and 
leased ones. 
  Reformation of state property in accordance with the 
privatization program led to the existence of enterprises with 
various forms of ownership. This, in turn, brought about a loss 
of state control over branches of national economy; loss of 
control over utilization of property and direction followed in 
enterprise activity. This likewise occurred in the 
material-technical supply field, where there is practically no 
government management at all, and there are no new forms 
reflecting the market relations yet, even though they are needed. 
  As a result, mutual ties are lost, organizational unity is 
disrupted, volumes of wholesale trade in production-technical 
types of products has decreased, and the property of warehousing 
complexes, which were built over a long period of time and were 
designed for organizing product delivery, has been dispersed. 
  Wholesale purchases today are not what they used to be. The 
state does not subsidize them, turnover is not fulfilled, and 
the enterprise itself selects where it is to buy what it needs 
and who to work with. There is no one to control that, and 
vertical management has been disrupted. 
  Enterprises have now, on the average, cut their production 
by 
half. While, in state management, nothing has changed. At the 
ministry or in the committee, workers are on a budget. You come 
to the office, there is a chair for you, a table, a fountain 
pen, and you get paid your wages. This in no way depends on the 
lamentable situation at the enterprises. These enterprises, 
already incorporated, leased, or private, are all those that 
formed a part of the former Gossnab [State Committee for 
Material and Technical Supply], and it cannot control them. What 
happened is not just a detachment of enterprises from the state, 
but a direct break. As a result, a new management organ was 
created--the state joint-stock holding company. 
  [Maevskyy] If I understand it correctly, we do not have 
bankruptcies, and a poorly operating enterprise still gets a 
subsidy from the government. 
  [Volkovskyy] There is a concept called clearing up. That is 
aid for enterprises. You work for a newspaper and know the 
situation with newsprint. At the same time, we have an 
enterprise in Zhidachov capable of producing such newsprint. 
But, since the coupon today is not convertible, the enterprise 
is unable to purchase pulp for itself, and, without that, no 
newsprint can be produced. The enterprise is heading toward 
bankruptcy not because of its own fault. Who would want it to 
close? The newest equipment is available, there are personnel, 
and there is a need for newsprint. But, our monetary system and 
monetary relations with Russia disrupt everything. 
  [Maevskyy] They could really provide Ukraine with newsprint? 
  [Volkovskyy] There are decisions of the Supreme Council and 
decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers, but, with our current 
situation, all we can do is darn the various holes. Zhidachov 
needs a million dollars to replace machinery, the building 
already exists, and then start newsprint production. They could 
produce 40,000 tonnes. Last year, Ukraine imported 20,000 tonnes 
through state deliveries. At present the editorial offices of 
many newspapers make direct purchases on their own. Some 80,000 
tonnes were consumed. 
  [Maevskyy] Well, we found out something about the holding 
company, now tell us about yourself. 
  [Volkovskyy] I progressed through life step by step. I was 
born in 1938, have a wife and two sons. Served in the army, 
worked at construction projects, graduated first from a 
construction technical school and then the economics department 
at the university. Worked with the oblast planning committee, 
then transferred to the oblast supply and sales organization 
that was part of the Gossnab system. Later, during 
reorganization of that service, I was transferred to Kiev as 
head of the main directorate. I assumed my present post after 
leaving the position of first deputy chairman of the State 
Committee for Material Resources. 
  [Maevskyy] By any chance, do you engage in sports? 
  [Volkovskyy] I used to be very interested in skiing during 
the winter in Ukraine and when I served in Podmoskovye. I 
participated in the All-Union army competitions. At present, I 
have no time for sports. My Saturdays and Sundays are busy. 
  It is necessary to learn to think in a new way, and a new 
organization of labor is required. I would like to do everything 
possible in order to improve the social sphere. After all, it 
makes no difference to the commercial structures who they sell 
to, the same markup is made for enterprises, for kindergartens, 
and for hospitals, which today have nothing at all--no sheets, 
no garments... 
  [Maevskyy] Or medicines, alas. 
  [Volkovskyy] Medicines are the concern of the Ministry of 
Public Health. In general, the government should take supply 
upon itself. I believe that euphoria from the Snickers and Mars 
candy shall pass, since our own confectionery products and 
sausage have always been better than those from abroad. 
  It is merely necessary to contribute less to the economics 
of 
political struggle. It is important not to break all ties for 
political reasons. No matter who is shouting or what is shouted, 
Ukraine does not have pulp and apatite and never will have them, 
there is no rubber. We cannot and should not live in economic 
isolation. 
  [Maevskyy] Thanks for the discussion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Minister Valentin Kulychenko by A. </F>
Malyenko; place and date not given: "Program Priorities"] 
  [Text] Preparation of the Ukrainian Program for 
Development of the Mining and Metallurgical Complex Up to 2010 
has been completed. The PRAVDA UKRAINY editorial office 
requested Deputy Minister Valentin Kulychenko to talk about its 
principal points and evaluate the situation that is forming in 
the branch. 
  [Malyenko] Valentin Arsenyevich, quite a few programs were 
adopted in years past as well, among other things, also 
concerning the metallurgical branch. That, however, did not help 
avoid the catastrophic drop in production. What will the 
adoption of another program accomplish? Is it really necessary 
to plan development of enterprises from above? After all, their 
directors should know better than anyone how to develop their 
own production. 
  [Kulychenko] This program differs from the preceding ones in 
that it is based on new approaches, taking into account the 
current state of affairs in the economy. It sets totally 
concrete tasks. First of all, it proposes supplying the domestic 
market with required products. In that connection, priorities 
are determined--out of their total number, individual 
enterprises that must be developed on a priority bases are 
differentiated. 
  It is understandable that every director, naturally, would 
not prefer to postpone until better times the modernization or 
reconstruction of his enterprise. But, it is impossible to 
satisfy all of these proposals, or rather demands. There are not 
enough funds for this. Also, in the plans everyone intends to 
increase production two- to threefold. If that was realized, 
then we would be swamped with metal products and there would be 
no place to dispose of them. 
  [Malyenko] But, at the same time, one cannot prohibit some 
collective from developing its production. 
  [Kulychenko] No one is forbidding them to do so. Do that, by 
all means, but count only on your own resources. Benefits and 
assistance will not be granted to everyone, but only to those 
who are performing a priority task. 
  Otherwise, this is what could happen. In a very severe 
economic situation, when the country lacks funds for the 
purchase of fuel, medicines, and various essential goods, the 
creation of totally unpromising production could start. Here are 
some concrete examples. 
  A mill is under construction at the Donetsk Metallurgical 
Plant designed for the production of 600,000 motor vehicle 
springs per year. What are they going to do with those springs? 
After all, the foreign market does not need them, while 
Ukrainian requirements come to only 250,000 springs. But, 
despite everything, the director, being a deputy, won 
preferential-term financing for that facility. 
  The same action was taken by the Ilyich Combine in Mariupol 
by purchasing and installing two tube-rolling mills. There is no 
need for those products, and 7 million dollars were spent on the 
purchase of necessary equipment alone. At the present time, the 
director of the Yenakiyevo Metallurgical Plant is obtaining 
funds to reconstruct one of the rolling mills. The goal appears 
to be sound--increased output of reinforced steel and wire rods. 
But, the point is that, at the neighboring Makeyevka Plant, such 
reconstruction is already being completed and these high-quality 
products that meet world standards will be produced there in the 
near future. Therefore, it would be wiser to allocate the funds 
demanded by Yenakiyevo for other enterprises in accordance with 
adopted priorities. This program is called upon to deal 
specifically with such cases. 
  [Malyenko] Still, it would be naive to assume that, with the 
adoption of the program, trouble-free vistas are opening up for 
the enterprises. It would be good if you could talk frankly 
about those things that are not considered in the program, but 
without which there can be no real improvement in the economic 
situation within the metallurgical branch. 
  [Kulychenko] Our program is good on the technical plane, and 
it worked out with something of a technical tilt. Unfortunately, 
however, it was impossible to include all of the current 
economic factors in it. This particularly applies to a study of 
market conditions. It will be necessary to literally fight for a 
share of the markets, at the same time, however, speaking quite 
frankly, we are poorly prepared for that. 
  Serious attention should be focused on the experience of 
Western firms, which would never undertake reconstruction 
without a skilled business plan. Another thing we could learn 
from them is the conduct of reconstruction stage-by-stage, 
step-by-step, beginning with whatever will yield profit at the 
earliest date. Western specialists, for instance, tell us: You 
have good metallurgical production, it is fully competitive, but 
the buyer may not like the outside appearance of products, the 
packaging. Therefore, someone should probably start not with 
radical reconstruction but with the packaging sector, to give 
the goods a marketable appearance. 
  A great deal of money is needed for the successful clearing 
up of enterprises and rejuvenation of the branch as a whole. If 
technical rearmament relies mainly on funds earned by the 
metallurgists themselves, then some budgetary appropriations 
will also be required for the resolution of social problems. 
This pertains especially to such a painful question as the 
retraining and employment services for laid off workers. This 
topic, by the way, requires a separate discussion--there are too 
many problems involved. 
  What is extremely important is the creation of conditions to 
attract investments in the branch. At present, our unstable 
legislation is simply scaring off foreign investors. Their 
importance for rejuvenation of production may be judged on the 
basis of the following example. As soon as we were given several 
trillions of karbovantsy in credits during April, the volume of 
production immediately increased by a fourth in the course of 
the month, as compared with the first quarter. 
  The metallurgical branch is capable of satisfying the needs 
of the country's national economy while yielding competitive 
products. It is merely necessary to remove those obstacles that 
are preventing this potential from working to the fullest extent.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Chernyavskiy: "Concept of Economic Policy </F>
and Implementation of Economic Reforms in the Republic of Crimea 
in the Period 1994-1998"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  General Assessment of the Current Economic Situation in </H5>
Crimea 
  The main purpose of this concept is to determine the 
priorities of economic policy and economic transformations in 
the Republic of Crimea for the period 1994-1998 and the 
implementation by the Supreme Council, government, and organs of 
state power and administration locally of measures pertaining to 
organizational, legislative, and political backing for the 
reforms. 
  The concept proceeds from recognition of the fact that the 
economy of the Republic of Crimea is in a transitional phase 
both from the viewpoint of the formation of a market mechanism 
of operation and from the viewpoint of the creation of the 
conditions for an escape from the crisis. 
  The main features of this transitional stage 
(transformational recession, according to Kornai) in Crimea are: 
  transition from a supply economy to a demand economy; 
  a drastic slump in production; 
  inflation and hyperinflation; 
  decline in real personal income; 
  an investment crisis; 
  change in the structure of foreign economic relations. 
  The first proposition is reflected in the incapacity of the 
majority of industrial and agricultural enterprises of Crimea 
for independently undertaking marketing, drawing up business 
plans, and actively seeking solvent consumers of their products 
in Ukraine and abroad. Another expression of the proposition is 
the incapacity of state-owned enterprises to rationally 
distribute income in consumption and accumulation. Combined with 
Ukraine's official policy of limiting the supply of money (in 
addition to money and credit issue), this is causing a most 
acute reciprocal arrears crisis. 
  The slump in production in Crimea could be characterized by 
the following figures. Production in industry as a whole in 1993 
declined 11.5 percent compared with the 1992 level. In 1994 the 
decline in industrial production has accelerated appreciably. In 
January-April of this year the decline constituted 33.1 percent 
compared with the corresponding period of 1993. The greatest 
decline in production was observed at enterprises oriented 
toward imported raw material and intermediate products and sale 
of the finished product to countries of the CIS. This applies 
primarily to enterprises of chemical industry, light industry, 
and building materials industry. The slump has affected consumer 
goods production also. In terms of the most important 
item--food--production in 1993 declined 12.6 percent compared 
with 1992, and in four months of this year, 35.9 percent. 
  Agricultural production has been slumping since 1990. At the 
present time Crimea's agriculture has been thrown back to the 
1965-1970 level. 
  The inflationary processes characteristic of all the 
postcommunist countries have in the past two years been 
developing rapidly in Ukraine and, particularly, in Crimea. In 
1993 the wholesale prices of industrial products grew by a 
factor of 43. Prices of the products of fuel industry grew by a 
factor of 283 here, food industry, by a factor of 50, and fish 
industry, by a factor of 80. The retail price of foodstuffs in 
1993 grew by a factor of 113, and of nonfood commodities, by a 
factor of 89. On account of the tightening of monetary policy in 
Ukraine, the increase in prices in Crimea has slowed 
considerably in 1994. In the first four months of the current 
year the prices of foodstuffs have increased by a factor of 1.5, 
of nonfood commodities, by a factor of 2.3. 
  A consequence of the general economic crisis and 
hyperinflation in Crimea has been a sharp decline in society's 
living standard. Despite a growth in personal income in Crimea 
in 1993 by a factor of 28, including a growth in wages by a 
factor of 23, the price of goods and services grew by a factor 
of 60. Thus the personal living standard declined in one year by 
a factor of 2.5 approximately. Hyperinflation has hit employees 
of the publicly funded sphere and retirees particularly hard. 
Over 75 percent of the population of Crimea (according to 
official figures) has an income below the minimum consumer 
budget. The differentiation of society in terms of income has 
increased, but has not yet assumed Russian proportions. 
  A most important ingredient of the general economic crisis 
in 
Ukraine and in Crimea has been the investment crisis. It is 
manifested primarily in the fact that the amount of capital 
investments is declining more rapidly than the volume of 
production. In 1993 capital investments declined 34 percent 
compared with the 1992 level and 51 percent compared with the 
1991 level. Capital investments in production have been falling 
at a preferential rate here. Hyperinflation devalues funds 
allocated for investments within two or three months and makes 
it impossible to recharge them. The corrosion of the production 
potential that has been created and the postponement of the 
period of the movement of the economy of Crimea onto a 
production growth trajectory are the consequences of the 
investment crisis. 
  The vast majority of industrial and agricultural enterprises 
of Crimea was created by ministries and departments of the 
former Union and functioned as part of the so-called national 
economic complex. Following the disintegration of the USSR, 
there was a severance of business ties, which exerted a 
particularly strong influence on the enterprises of Crimea 
oriented toward exports and the rendering of services chiefly to 
Russian structures. In 1993 Ukraine's share of Crimea's 
commodity turnover grew to 80 percent. Russia's share of the 
total commodity exchange of industrial engineering products 
declined more than threefold compared with 1991. A sharply 
negative balance of trade arose in Crimea in consequence. Some 2 
trillion karbovantsy of industrial engineering products were 
imported into Crimea in 1993, some 432 billion karbovantsy were 
exported, that is, imports exceeded exports by a factor of 4.2, 
including consumer goods by a factor of 2.8. 
  Considering the analysis that has been offered, the goals 
and 
tasks of economic policy of the Republic of Crimea should 
incorporate: 
  stabilization of the socioeconomic situation in the Republic 
of Crimea and the creation of the base conditions for the 
emergence of the main sectors of the economy from crisis; 
  the creation of the conditions for the progressive and 
stable 
development of the economy of the Republic of Crimea by way of 
the formation of stable and effective components of the market 
infrastructure. 
<H5>  Basic Tasks of Economic Policy </H5>
  Considering the specifics of the socioeconomic and political 
situation in the Republic of Crimea, the concept proceeds from 
the fact that the set goals of economic policy may be realized 
if only in their essentials within a period of no fewer than 
four or five years. But the situation in the economy and the 
social sphere at the present time is such that the fundamental 
tasks must be tackled as quickly as possible--within a year. It 
is this that dictates the need for the implementation of 
transformations in two stages. 
  At the first stage, which, it is surmised, will extend to 
mid-1995, it is contemplated securing a stabilization of the 
socioeconomic situation in the Republic of Crimea and 
accomplishing the following tasks: 
  First, halting the decline in production at state-owned 
enterprises and stabilizing product manufacture at the maximum 
possible level corresponding to the level of demand and not 
requiring appreciable expenditures from the state budget. 
  Second, stimulating a growth of production in the priority 
sectors of the economy with the aid of a system of targeted soft 
government loans or on the basis of interstate (between states 
of the CIS and the Baltic) commodity exchange agreements. 
  Third, alleviating the negative socioeconomic consequences 
of 
the transitional period by way of the introduction of targeted 
subsidies for individual categories of the populace (thanks to a 
reduction in budget subsidies for the manufacturers of 
individual types of product). 
  Fourth, beginning wide-ranging privatization in Crimea and 
creating the conditions for the development of private 
initiative. 
  At the second stage it is contemplated ensuring the 
conditions for the progressive and stable development of the 
economy of the Republic of Crimea. The accomplishment of the 
following tasks is envisaged in the course of this stage: 
  First, evolutionary structural changes in the economy and 
the 
laying of the foundations for the formation of the optimum 
structure of production thanks to an improvement in the system 
of the allocation of credit and the taxation of private 
investments and the creation of economic legislation conforming 
to market conditions. 
  Second, completing privatization in Crimea, in the main. 
  Third, introducing the conditions of "smooth" bankruptcy and 
providing for the privatization of state-owned enterprises not 
capable of functioning without budget subsidies. 
  Fourth, overcoming the investment crisis and attracting 
private, including foreign, investments to the priority spheres 
of the economy on the basis of the political and economic 
stability that has been established in Crimea. 
  Fifth, providing for the formation of a stable and efficient 
system of foreign economic relations of the Republic of Crimea. 
<H5>  Means of Realization of the Set Goals </H5>
  The achievement of the set goals presupposes the pursuit of 
a 
consistent and balanced socioeconomic, structural, investment, 
and foreign trade policy that should be built on the basis of 
the optimum combination of state regulation of base economic 
processes and the development of market relations. The main 
means of realization of economic policy is law-making activity 
bolstered by measures of organizational and political support 
for the reforms. 
  It is essential to take into consideration here the fact 
that 
the measures implemented at the first stage geared primarily to 
a stabilization of the socioeconomic situation of the country 
cannot be regarded as a final version of the reforms. At the 
same time they must not conflict with the strategic goals of 
economic policy. Proceeding from this, the proposed measures 
pertain chiefly to the first stage of the reforms and will be 
adjusted subsequently or continued, depending on the results 
that have been achieved and the revision (preservation) of the 
main reference points of economic policy. 
  The implementation of the reforms will affect chiefly the 
currency-finance and budget sphere, investment activity, and the 
banking system and also foreign economic activity and the sphere 
of customs regulation. At the same time, on the other hand, it 
would be expedient, particularly at the first stage, to 
concentrate efforts on two basic problems: 
  stabilization of the production sphere and the adoption to 
this end of emergency measures in the sphere of industrial and 
agricultural policy; 
  the adoption of programs of social support for the populace. 
<H5>  Measures To Stabilize the Production Sphere </H5>
  The main directions of industrial and agricultural 
policy are dictated by the need to halt the slump in 
production and to alleviate the negative consequences of 
structural reorganization in sectors of the production sphere. 
These tasks, while essentially local, will determine, 
nonetheless, the success of all the strategic designs of the 
Government of the Republic of Crimea. Despite the diversity of 
causes of the crisis in the production sphere, it is proposed 
putting the emphasis in industrial and agricultural policy on a 
resolution of the following problems: 
  an improvement in financial and tax legislation and the 
conditions of foreign economic activity; 
  the establishment of business relations between enterprises 
of the Republic of Crimea and the suppliers of material and 
technical resources from other countries of the CIS and the 
Baltic; 
  an improvement in the system of centralized and commercial 
lending; 
  the replenishment of enterprises' financial resources. 
  An improvement in financial and tax legislation and 
also the conditions of foreign economic activity is an 
essential condition of the stabilization in Crimea of sectors of 
industry and the national economy. It is planned in the sphere 
of taxation to implement a set of measures for easing the tax 
burden. These measures will include a gradual lowering of the 
tax rate (this applies primarily to value-added tax and profits 
tax), a limitation of the number of levyable types of tax, a 
simplification of the taxation procedure, and the establishment 
of preferential tax rates for individual subjects of economic 
activity. The government intends simultaneously implementing 
measures to reinforce the tax system. 
  Currency legislation requires a certain liberalization. The 
first steps in this direction have already been taken. 
Nonetheless, the general approach to the problem of expansion of 
the circulation of foreign currencies in cash and noncash form 
should be balanced and cautious. It is essential to consider 
that substantial numbers of the population of Crimea are 
employed in the publicly funded sphere and that retirees have 
income that is almost exclusively in the national currency of 
Ukraine. 
  In the sphere of regulation of foreign economic activity it 
is essential to switch to a more simplified procedure of the 
issue of licenses for export-import transactions and to shorten 
the list of commodities subject to export restrictions. 
  The system of accounting for the results of economic 
activity 
of enterprises of all types of ownership, specifically, the 
current procedure of attribution of outlays to production costs, 
requires improvement. 
  It is impossible to restore the business ties of 
enterprises without serious state support, the sense of which 
amounts to the creation of a guaranteed market of goods and 
services. 
  As already observed, the balance of production and 
consumption in the republic is shaping up such that a 
substantial part of the gross product passes through foreign 
trade channels. Negotiations and the conclusion of agreements at 
government level with other states of the CIS and the Baltic on 
reciprocal supplies of commodities in accordance with an agreed 
product list could be a principal step, therefore, in the 
creation of a stable market for the products manufactured and 
consumed by enterprises of Crimea. 
  The government should contribute to the creation at 
state-owned enterprises of a modern service for marketing and 
the compilation of business plans and systems of determination 
of the economic efficiency of investment projects. This also 
should contribute to the establishment of business ties between 
enterprises of the Republic of Crimea and suppliers and 
consumers of their products in countries of the CIS, the Baltic, 
and the far abroad. 
  Reciprocal supplies in accordance with intergovernmental 
agreements could be undertaken not only by state-owned but also 
private enterprises, and enterprises and firms could be enlisted 
in the fulfillment of supplies on a competitive basis, what is 
more. At the same time it would be expedient for the Government 
of the Republic of Crimea, when negotiating, to proceed from the 
commodity flows that had been established prior to the crisis 
and in whose preservation both the governments and the local 
authorities of other states are interested. This would 
predetermine the enlistment in the fulfillment of the said 
supplies chiefly of state-owned enterprises that have an 
established list of manufactured products. 
  It is essential in parallel to stimulate the establishment 
of 
direct business ties between enterprises of the Republic of 
Crimea and their partners in other states. The officially 
approved formats of the supply of vegetables and fruit to the 
northern parts of Russia and the sale of passes for health 
center-resort treatment directly at enterprises of other 
republics could constitute a basis for such mutual relations. 
  An improvement in the system of centralized and 
commercial lending presupposes primarily the organization 
of a negotiating process between the Government of Ukraine and 
the National Bank of Ukraine for the normalization of the 
allocation to Crimea of credit resources at the effective 
discount rate. At the present time the National Bank makes 
resources available to the ministries and departments, which 
then channel them to the enterprises. Under these conditions an 
acute shortage of credit resources has come about in Crimea, and 
there is a large gap between the discount and commercial lending 
rate. As a result of the negotiating process Crimea, as a 
region, should obtain a certain quota of centralized credit 
resources of Ukraine. These resources should be distributed by 
the Republic Bank of Crimea in the priority directions 
determined by the Government of Crimea. The commercial banks, 
via which the credit resources would be channeled to the 
consumers, must not raise the National Bank of Ukraine rate 
above the margin established by the Republic Bank of Crimea. 
  The shortage of financial resources of the 
enterprises may be overcome by use of the system of the 
preferential financing and stimulation of commodity-exchange 
transactions. 
  The system of preferential financing should differ 
fundamentally from that employed earlier in Ukraine and in 
Russia, in accordance with which financial resources were 
allocated from the state budget via the central banks at an 
artificially low rate. It is proposed putting the main emphasis 
on the attraction of the financial resources of the commercial 
banks, not only Crimean but also those of Ukraine, Russia, and 
other states of the CIS, what is more, at the market interest 
rate with compensation for the difference between the current 
and preferential credit rate from resources of the state budget. 
The recipient enterprise must guarantee here repayment of the 
credit subsidies from an increase in taxes paid to the treasury. 
The level of the preferential rate will be established at the 
time of the adoption of the budget of the Republic of Crimea 
with regard to the priority nature of the sectors of the 
national economy. 
  Considering the limited possibilities of the republic 
budget, 
the agro-industrial complex should remain a most important 
sphere of soft loans. 
  The stimulation of commodity-exchange transactions is a 
forced step partially compensating for Crimean enterprises' lack 
of financial resources. The system of stimulation should be 
structured predominantly on the basis of the granting of 
commodity-exchange tax privileges if the "product for raw 
material components" or "product for production engineering 
equipment" exchange format is observed. In this case the losses 
of the state budget in the granting of these privileges would be 
partially or even fully compensated thanks to the increased 
taxes from the growth of the production of the enterprises in 
receipt of these privileges. 
  The broad-based privatization of enterprises of state and 
municipal ownership should begin in Crimea at the first stage. 
It would be expedient beginning the privatization with small and 
medium-sized enterprises. It is essential in the organization of 
the privatization process to take account of the interests both 
of the work force and of persons employed in the publicly funded 
sphere and retirees with registered privatization accounts 
(vatsily). It would be expedient in the privatization of 
large-scale properties to organize investment bids to attract 
additional funds for their reconstruction and development. 
  Privatization should lend new impetus to the development of 
Crimea's enterprises, increase the interest of the work force in 
the results of their activity, stimulate the more rational 
distribution of the newly created value, and increase the rate 
of savings in profits. 
  The broad-based privatization of the land and also 
properties 
of the recreational sphere is not contemplated at the first 
stage of implementation of the reforms in Crimea. 
  The anticipated result of the proposed measures is 
the restoration of business ties of the enterprises of the 
Republic of Crimea and a partial resolution of the problem of 
arrears and the lack of financial resources. The expenditure of 
the state budget on implementation of the said measures would be 
negligible and would not exceed the current level of subsidies 
for the public sector. Time of implementation--within the first 
stage of the reforms, with subsequent adjustment.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Baranowski under rubric "From the State </F>
Committee for Statistics": "A Situation of Uncertainty. Some 
Results of Four Months of the Work of the National Economy"] 
  [Text] The republic's economic situation is characterized 
by the same crisis phenomena that prevailed earlier. The State 
Committee for Statistics [SCS] reports that the national income 
generated in the four months comes to only 66 percent of last 
year's, and the same problems persist in regard to sales of 
finished goods and mutual settlements. As of 1 May, the value of 
stocks of finished goods stood at 3 trillion rubles (other 
estimates put the figure somewhat higher). Our enterprises' 
indebtedness to enterprises of other countries of the near 
abroad, chiefly Russia, for goods shipped and services rendered, 
is growing. Profitability is falling--i.e., the cost of 
producing goods is rising faster than profits from their sale. 
In January-March, profitability in industry stood at only 12.7 
percent, and the lowest level was in instrument making--6.2 
percent. In the first quarter, 995 enterprises and 
organizations--12.3 percent of the total number--made losses. 
Losses totaled 930.5 billion rubles. 
  According to the results of four months, production output 
declined by 62.2 percent in the fuel industry (including by 66.2 
percent in oil refining), 43.3 percent in the building materials 
industry, 42.9 percent in light industry, 35 percent in machine 
building, and 31.2 percent in the woodworking, pulp and paper 
industry. The smallest decline was 15.6 in the food industry. In 
industry as a whole, production volumes declined by 33.3 percent. 
  In April, 17 enterprises did not work at all, and 264 
reduced 
their work week. The SCS reports that work time losses for 
various reasons in January-April--including due to lack of 
material resources and difficulties with sales--were equivalent 
to a 13.6-percent rate of idleness of the average number of 
workers on roster (add to this a few percentage points of the 
official unemployment level and we may get a figure close to its 
actual level). 
  Inflation hit hard once more in April. In February and March 
it rose by 18.7 and 10.2 percent, respectively, but in April it 
hit 28.6 percent (by the way, some sources put it even higher). 
Undoubtedly, as might be expected, the inflation was made worse 
by unsecured "seed" credit. 
  The republic's economy started this month under conditions 
of 
the proclaimed common customs space with Russia. Our anticipated 
gain from this is the lifting of Russian duties on energy, in 
particular. But it must be kept in mind that even duty-free 
Russian resources, however cheap, still have to be paid for with 
money earned primarily on the Russian market (or currency), 
money earned under conditions of competition in the market with 
other foreign producers and Russians too. Sometimes, moreover, 
we fall prey to that old over-confidence and say, If the price 
of energy were equal, Russian producers couldn't compete with 
us. We say, The Russian farmer would only buy our tractors. 
  Meanwhile, Russia is swiftly reforming its economic 
relations 
and, accordingly, "educating" strong potential competitors with 
whom our producers will inevitably clash. Our measures in 
response, and the results thereof, are much more modest. The 
recent mission of the International Monetary Fund that surveyed 
our economy pointed out that our economic policy in general is 
characterized by a situation of uncertainty which, among other 
things, is also being greatly influenced by persistent 
uncertainty regarding the uniting of monetary systems. We can 
agree with this assessment, but it is worth adding that this 
situation has clearly gone on too long.

<F P=106> [Interview with Afik Velimetov, chief economist of the </F>
Azerbaijan Publishing House, by Rustam Aliyev, BAKINSKIY 
RABOCHIY correspondent; date and place not given: "Improvements 
Have Been Noticed; Problems Remain"] 
  [Text] The Azerbaijan Publishing House, the 
republic's largest printing facility, has recently been 
experiencing very difficult times. The severance of economic 
ties; the sharp jump in prices for printing materials imported 
into the republic, primarily from Russia; and other 
market-related expenses have created quite a few problems. As a 
result, the regularity with which many newspapers are published 
has been disrupted, prices for publishing services have 
increased almost every month, and the printing rendition and 
quality of the printed product have sharply fallen. The subject 
of the interview "How They Have Robbed 'Azerbaijan,'" with the 
publishing house's general director, which was published in 
BAKINSKIY RABOCHIY and KHALG GAZETI on the first of April of 
this year, concerned these and many other aspects of the 
publishing house's activity. 
  "How are things today with the publishing house? What 
has changed since its transfer to management by the 
Administration of Affairs in the president's staff?" The 
conversation of our correspondent with Afik Velimetov, chief 
economist of the Azerbaijan Publishing House, began with these 
questions. 
  [Velimetov] In my opinion, this year should be the decisive 
one in the publishing house's emergence from its protracted 
crisis. The first quarter results inspire optimism and are 
witness to the fact that, in the main, the path selected to 
overcome the combination of problems is the correct one. I will 
not make unsubstantiated statements; I will cite concrete facts. 
Thus, the profit that remained at the publishing house's 
disposal during that quarter is almost twice as much as that 
which all of last year brought us. Whereas our debt to the bank 
was 70.1 million manats on 1 January, it does not exceed 18 
million manats today, despite the enormous inflation and the 
increase in bank interest for loans. 
  [Aliyev] How have you managed to achieve these changes? 
Perhaps the delivery of printing materials has been normalized? 
  [Velimetov] No, it is just the opposite. Deliveries have not 
only been reduced, but the prices for these materials have 
increased sharply. Moreover, as before, questions connected with 
exchanging the manat for rubles have not been solved, and 
transportation expenditures and customs duties have increased, 
in particular, for products imported into the republic from 
Russia. As I have already pointed out, however, a certain 
improvement is being observed in the publishing house's 
financial and economic activity. The fact that we were able to 
forecast future difficulties awaiting our printing trade has 
helped us prepare somehow for them. 
  First, we oriented and mobilized the collective and our 
printing capabilities to the production of so-called cultural 
and personal goods and consumer goods. In particular, we 
expanded publication of the products list of goods absent in the 
market. In particular, we organized the production of school 
notebooks and textbooks. An increase in management and 
production discipline helped us establish economic effectiveness 
for each order more carefully. This decreased expenditures per 
one manat of commodity output from last year's level of 96 
gyapiks to 61 gyapiks by the end of the first quarter. In 
addition, we organized businesslike and mutually beneficial 
relations with the republic's book publishers. 
  [Aliyev] Did not all of this reflect adversely on the 
publication of newspapers? 
  [Velimetov] I ask that you direct your attention to the fact 
that our prices for printing newspapers and for newsprint has 
not changed since January, that is, we were somehow able to 
stabilize the prices for the publishing house's main type of 
activity--providing typographic services for newspaper 
production, which occupied approximately 80 percent of our total 
commodity volume for years. Now, the percentage of newspaper 
production does not exceed 50 percent. 
  [Aliyev] Perhaps, it has become unprofitable for you to 
publish newspapers? 
  [Velimetov] I would not say that.... The drop in the 
percentage of newspaper production is connected with the 
reduction in the circulation of periodicals; this is 
unprofitable and inefficient from an economic point of view. 
That is why we are introducing practical adjustments in the list 
of published products. This is a demand of the times and the 
meaning of market relations--for example, having analyzed the 
situation, we increased our attention toward the production of 
book items. 
  [Aliyev] It is rumored that a new landslide-type increase in 
prices for the publishing of newspapers is coming in the near 
future--as has previously occurred repeatedly.... 
  [Velimetov] I think that a landslide-like increase in prices 
will not occur, although there is still no complete guarantee of 
this. We are following a reasonable pricing policy, as the 
market demands. In cases where the publishing house's 
capabilities permit stable prices for the publication of 
newspaper products to be maintained, prices will remain the same. 
  If the trend toward further increasing prices for printing 
materials is maintained, this naturally will force us also to 
increase their wholesale cost, since it is impossible to forget 
about the interests of the publishing house and its collective, 
which we are obliged to protect. However, there are factors that 
are independent of us; these are an increase in energy rates, 
raw material imported from Russia, and so on. 
  [Aliyev] Many newspapers are today not being published in 
general. Is this not connected with the toughening of the 
publishing house's economic policy? 
  [Velimetov] For a long time, quite a few newspapers were 
published....on credit, violating the production contract with 
the publishing house. It came down to the fact that the 
editorial boards' total incurred debt to the publishing house 
reached the half-billion (in rubles) mark. This put the normal 
existence of the publishing house itself in doubt. It was 
necessary to toughen the economic interrelationships with the 
debtor editorial boards, since it was simply impossible for us 
and for them to work this way any longer. Of course, 
dissatisfied people appeared, but we withstood the pressure. 
  Incidentally, thanks to this completely fair policy, we are 
managing to raise wages and, at the same time, distribute them. 
Moreover, many other social problems, whose realization is more 
than an enterprise can afford today, are being solved--for 
example, we are planning to lay the foundation of a nine-storey 
apartment house for our workers this year. We are planning to 
repair the main building of the publishing house, and much more. 
A preliminary plan for establishing a vacation area in 
Absheronskiy Rayon for printing workers exists. As they say, 
Allah will smile as soon as the war ends.... 
  [Aliyev] In your view, were the first quarter's positive 
results achieved exclusively thanks to the toughening of 
relations with your partners? 
  [Velimetov] Of course not. This is the beginning of the 
implementation of a long-term program based on the effective use 
of the experience acquired by the collective, efficient 
operation of equipment, savings in expenditures of raw material 
and materials, strict production and management discipline, and, 
the most important thing, the accurate construction of relations 
with partners and customers--in a word, the realization of all 
components making up normal market relations. 
  I will also talk about something else in this connection. A 
joint enterprise with Russia, which will supply the publishing 
house with printing materials, is now in the founding stage; we 
hope that it will start operating in the very near future. Let 
us say right out that we are placing rather large hopes on this 
joint enterprise. 
  In addition, we have established a motor transport 
enterprise, which engages in all repair and maintenance work and 
provides services to the population, on the basis of the 
publishing house's garage. Incidentally, we would like to report 
that the publishing house allocated R96 million last year to 
cover the financial losses connected with motor transport 
servicing of the editorial boards. One cannot resign oneself to 
this situation in the future; that is why we have established an 
independent enterprise having the rights of a juridical person, 
which will be financed through its own activity. In the future, 
the publishing house will receive a percentage of its profit. 
  [Aliyev] It is known that many enterprises have not been 
distributing wages for months, that some are completely idle, 
due to a lack of materials and raw materials and, moreover, that 
they have recently resorted to such actions, which you know 
about, as a reduction in workers. Will this not apply also to 
the publishing house? 
  [Velimetov] Considering the present slump in production 
everywhere, perhaps a reduction in production and management 
personnel should follow in accordance with the severe laws of a 
market economy. However, we are not pursuing such a goal, since 
we are trying to carry out market reforms with consideration 
given to the human factor. Moreover, as I have already pointed 
out, despite all difficulties, we are finding capabilities to 
increase wages regularly, pay a 13th wage, and so on. 
  [Aliyev] In conclusion, let us return to the recent 
interview 
"How They Have Robbed 'Azerbaijan,'" with the publishing house's 
general director. In particular, it was pointed out there that 
up to 25 commercial structures, which have practically not 
yielded any returns, were functioning in the publishing house in 
an incomprehensible manner. 
  [Velimetov] Since that time, we have been able to free 
ourselves from many commercial organizations that were 
unprofitable for the publishing house. In particular, we parted 
with ones like the Milli Dastan Theater, Topaz, Tidzharet, 
Ulduz, the Torpag Store Fund, Gyulzar, Elzar, Agdam, Araz-9, 
Karvan, and Khazar-1. Legally sound documents to cancel 
contracts are still being prepared for some, in order to use the 
areas occupied by them more efficiently. 
  It seems that if we should, for example, delay for half a 
year the implementation of the mentioned measures, the 
Azerbaijan publishing house would "fall ill" for a long time.... 
Naturally, it is very difficult to solve in a short time all the 
problems that have accumulated; of course, time is required to 
do this. I would like to believe that it will work for us and, 
consequently, for the good of the republic also.

<F P=106> [Report by Ye. Krishtalev and I. Roytapel: "Development of </F>
the Power Generation Sector and Social Problems"] 
  [Text] Last week a meeting with Academician Chingiz 
Dzhuvarly, a leading specialist in the field of power generation 
in Azerbaijan, was held at the Baku Institute of Social 
Administration and Political Sciences. He informed his listeners 
about the current situation in power generation and its 
situation in Azerbaijan, and associated social problems. 
  The academician elaborated on two problems facing the power 
generation industry in Azerbaijan and the world: first, power 
generation per se and increasing the equipment's efficiency; and 
second, transfer of power over distances. 
  Azerbaijan currently produces 4 million kwhr of electric 
power. It is envisaged to bring the power output to 10 million 
kwhr by the year 2005 (one large station in the West produces 
about 12 million kwhr). 
  On the subject of exporting electric power and Azerbaijan's 
potential, Academician Dzhuvarly said that our republic may 
become an electric power exporter and even now, in this 
difficult time for us, we export a quantity of power to 
neighboring Georgia. 
  In an interview specially for GUNAY, the scientist 
emphasized 
that according to the terms of the contract with a Western oil 
consortium, all payments for power consumption will be made by 
representatives of these companies. Chingiz Dzhuvarly also said 
that the republic population is not being deprived of its 
legitimate share of electric power despite the increase in power 
consumption due to oil companies' activities, since currently 
only 40 percent of the power produced is being utilized, and the 
other 60 percent "disappears" who knows where. 
  Academician Dzhuvarly talked about the trends in electric 
power generation from so-called small-scale sources--solar, 
wind-powered, and tide-powered power stations. The potential of 
solar energy is extremely great. If we process only 3 percent of 
the energy of our sun we will produce approximately 1 trillion 
kw. But, noted the academician, another serious problem 
arises--the problem of safety of life on the planet. The 
scientist named the limits for developing power generation and 
civilization on Earth--100 billion kw per 10 billion persons. If 
the capacity is increased above 100 billion kw, irreversible 
changes may occur on Earth, and a catastrophe is inevitable. 
  Ch. Dzhuvarly also shared his forecast of social relations 
in 
the future: He believes that large, developed, militarily strong 
countries in pursuit of gain will encroach on the interests of 
small, less developed countries, imposing on them a certain 
population and power generation limit, because overproduction of 
power and overpopulation may destroy civilization.

  [Text] A founding congress of the Democratic Youth Union of 
Azerbaijan [SDMA] was held on 11 June in the Azerbaijani State 
Academic Opera and Ballet Theater. The decision to create a 
union was made on 27 May 1994. Fifteen days later, SDMA 
initiative groups already were functioning in more than 20 
institutions of higher learning and secondary schools in the 
republic. The 500 delegates elected by these groups took part in 
the congress. 
  The congress adopted the Rules of the Democratic Youth Union 
of Azerbaijan. 
  Rovshan Dzhavadov outlined the main directions of SDMA 
activities. Then elections were held to the union's governing 
bodies. The congress elected Rovshan Dzhavadov as SDMA chairman. 
Elections were held to the Supreme Council and the Central Audit 
Commission. 
  The congress participants declared that in keeping with the 
Republic of Azerbaijan law on public organizations, the 
Democratic Youth Union of Azerbaijan will not engage in 
political activities. Its main goal is to aid directly the 
process of building a democratic state in Azerbaijan. Another 
important direction of its work is young people. Defining its 
tasks in the area of social protection of young people, their 
patriotic upbringing and physical fitness, as well as developing 
their talents, the union made a decision to hold a congress once 
every four years.

<F P=106> [KHABAR-SERVIS report: "Republic Does Not Have Foreign </F>
Currency Market as Such"] 
  [Text] The state of the foreign currency market in 
Azerbaijan and the exchange's effect on it were discussed in the 
course of the recent visit by an IMF mission to Azerbaijan, at a 
meeting between IMF representatives, headed by William 
Alexander, and top officials of the Baku Interbank Foreign 
Currency Exchange (BMVB). "I did not get, however, any advice or 
recommendations from W. Alexander regarding our work," said BMVB 
head manager Farkhad Amirbekov. "This is understandable: The 
foreign currency exchange practically does not function, which 
means there are no problems worth discussing. Neither is there a 
foreign currency market as such in Azerbaijan today." 
  Many questions in this area are awaiting resolution. F. 
Amirbekov noted that the two main components of the financial 
market in Azerbaijan--the interbank foreign currency market and 
the credit market closely associated with it, currently 
practically do not function. There is no free redistribution of 
noncash foreign currency, no normative acts of the National Bank 
regulating the foreign currency market, while the Law "On 
Foreign Currency Regulation," which the parliament has adopted, 
is still not operating. No system has been set up for hard 
currency earnings of enterprises to be redistributed between 
banks through unrestricted sale on the foreign currency market. 
Still unresolved are taxation issues for domestic and foreign 
enterprises on the territory of the republic that have foreign 
currency earnings. The Law "On Profit From Physical Persons" 
needs to be amended since in its current form it actually 
stimulates the growth of inflation. 
  The work of the BMVB is also made more difficult by the fact 
that beginning in May this year a certain percentage of 
enterprises' hard currency earnings is to be sold to the state 
at the National Bank exchange rate and become part of the Common 
Foreign Currency Fund, while the remaining share is left with 
the enterprises. Thus, the National Bank does not have its own 
resources and revenue, and cannot act freely with respect to the 
exchangeable part of the Stabilization Fund's resources. In our 
opinion, it is necessary to transfer the Stabilization Fund to 
the sole jurisdiction of the National Bank and resolve the 
question of distribution of foreign currency. In this case the 
Interbank Foreign Currency Exchange will begin to function, too. 
It would also make sense to mandate selling a part of 
enterprises' foreign currency earnings through the foreign 
currency exchange, as is done in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Moldova.

<F P=106> [Statement signed by Gela Kvlividze, Guram Ustiashvili, and </F>
Shalva Iashagashvili in the name of the National Committee of 
the Democratic Party, Tbilisi, March 1994: "Statement of the 
Democratic Party Concerning the Economic, Social, and Political 
Situation in Georgia"] 
  [Text] The economic crisis and social and political tension 
continue to worsen, the economy is fragmenting and falling 
apart, and economic violence prevails instead of free 
competition--in the form of illegal business and economic 
bureaucracy, resulting in the flourishing of economic 
parasitism. The population's social decline and economic 
impoverishment are worsening day by day. There is a real danger 
that the criminal world will achieve virtual statehood. The 
economic system's crisis has brought the state close to the 
limit beyond which society's degradation begins, due to many 
objective and subjective factors, which include: 
  --the conditions resulting from the disintegration of the 
Soviet Union, and the impact thereof; 
  --corruption and the looting of the nation's property by 
various legal and illegal means. 
  This situation has been greatly impacted by the conflicts in 
the Tskhinvali region and Abkhazia--especially the tragedy 
resulting from the Abkhazian war. It was clear from the outset 
that the Abkhazian conflict stemmed from a massive international 
conspiracy, and that various outside forces prepared to take 
part in it. But neither society nor our leadership managed to 
manifest Georgians' characteristic foresight, vigilance, wisdom, 
and ability to correctly assess their own capabilities; they 
fell into our enemy's trap, fell prey to illusion, and we have 
not escaped the historical punishment.... 
  A way needs to be found out of this grave social, economic, 
political, and energy crisis, and efforts to find one are 
underway. 
  We believe that society's development crucially depends not 
only on forms of property ownership but also on social, 
economic, and overall state policies founded on the social 
harmony of all segments of society. Prosperity for all! That is 
our aim. Hence, it is essential to work out and swiftly 
implement a realistic, effective plan to stabilize the economy 
and balance the budget on a concrete economic level whose basic 
principles are these: 
  --putting a halt to the decline in production and reforming 
the economy; 
  --preserving the scientific-technical and production 
potential; 
  --easing social tensions; 
  --stopping the decline in the standard of living; 
  --substantially relieving the burden of inflation; 
  --stabilizing the money exchange rate. 
  The necessary foundation for implementing these processes is 
the gradual transformation of the republic's economy to a social 
market economic system. In carrying out these measures an 
essential role is played by the national movement's strategy and 
tactics. The national movement is the kind of social-political 
movement which, at any given historical stage, must ensure more 
spiritual, physical, material, economic, cultural, and overall 
development-fostering conditions and possibilities in the life 
of the nation. It is an ongoing historical process which 
sometimes slows down and sometimes speeds up. Any movement which 
does not have these attributes cannot be considered a healthy 
national movement. A national movement is born spontaneously in 
the midst of the people and then takes on an organized 
character. It is united and indivisible. In the life of some 
peoples it may also happen that those in power, especially if 
they are imperialistic, themselves create a false national 
movement from the top in order to discredit the real national 
movement or as a screen for some action that is against the 
people's interests. This results in a historical paradox. 
Honesty is replaced by greed, beauty by ugliness, good by evil, 
light by darkness, all of this being passed off as historical 
values. Forces and processes like these can do more harm to any 
people than even the most savage invader. 
  National movement, national figure, and Man of the People 
are 
all merely words, and they ought not to be overused. It is the 
people who must acknowledge and confirm a national movement, and 
it is the age that must give any person the title Man of the 
People. History's demon laughs out loud! If any nation in whose 
life this kind of thing happens fails to form into a fist of 
fury and send them all back where they came from, that nation 
may truly become the victim of historical fate. 
  "God is with us," they cried.... But the mention of God in 
mouths of sin only angers Him and invites punishment. And that's 
what happened! We also must mention those who five or six years 
ago were praising to the skies that which they today are cursing 
to the skies, a grave sin. That's what it is. Let history judge 
everything. 
  In the matter of stabilizing the country, political 
stability 
occupies a special place, but political stability cannot be 
fostered by the notion, advanced by certain circles and taken up 
by certain segments of society, of scheduling early 
parliamentary elections. We know who those political forces are 
who are in favor of this notion, and their aims. We cannot share 
those views, for the following reason: First, a new Georgian 
Constitution has to be adopted; second, a law on local 
government and Georgia's territorial layout; third, a new law on 
elections must be worked out and passed; fourth, criminal gangs 
need to be crushed and the social situation needs to be 
stabilized. Only after that can we speak of new elections; 
otherwise what will happen is that armed gangs and mafia outfits 
will win the elections, and the people will wish they had 
today's Parliament back. 
  We agree that the work of Parliament is in need of 
substantial improvement, but we cannot go along with any insults 
to the Parliament, because insulting Parliament is the same as 
insulting the Georgian state. 
  We believe, at the same time, that all the members of 
Parliament will soon unite their efforts to work out and 
implement the organizational, legislative, and other measures 
which will give a worthy form to the first Georgian Parliament 
in Georgia's history.

<F P=106> [Article by N. Glukhoyedov, department chief of mineral and </F>
raw material base of the Russian Federation State Committee for 
Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources and L. Oganesyan, chief 
of the Information and Analytical Department of the Russian 
Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral 
Resources: "The Mineral-Raw Material Base and Geological Service 
of the Russian Federation"] 
  [Text] Around 20,000 mineral deposits have been discovered 
and explored in Russia. The inventory of reserves, however, was 
conducted under conditions created by a totally different price 
system, low-cost energy sources, and cheap shipping services. 
Now it is anticipated that the amount of profitable reserves 
will decrease by 30-70 percent as a result of re-evaluation of 
the various types of raw materials. 
  Reserves of natural gas, gold, silver, and diamonds in 
Russia 
are higher than world reserves, but for lead, zinc, and antimony 
they are very low--less than 20 years. Its territory lacks 
explored reserves of manganese, chrome, and zirconium ores, 
high-grade kaolin, barite, and Muscovite mica meeting 
contemporary industrial demands. 
  The mineral and raw material base of oil, gas, pit coal, 
iron, nonferrous and noble metals, diamonds, and agrochemical 
raw materials, and production capacities and infrastructure that 
were formed in past years so far are meeting the needs of Russia 
and even yield up to 70 percent of the foreign currency proceeds 
of the country through the export of mineral raw material. 
  At present 37 percent of the best projects are undergoing 
industrial assimilation, including the absolute majority of 
unique and large deposits which, comprising around 5 percent of 
their total number, contain almost 70 percent of the explored 
reserves and account for 50 percent of the raw material that is 
extracted. 
  The problem concerning development of the raw material base 
of the fuel-energy complex remains a highly important priority 
for the geologists. At present 76 percent of oil fields, which 
include 93 percent of the reserves, have already been assigned 
to oil-producing enterprises. A sharp decrease in the size of 
new deposits is taking place. In Western Siberia, for instance, 
in 1975 reserves of one deposit amounted on the average to 53 
million, in 1985--to 15 million, and in 1991-1993--to 11-13 
million tonnes. The average daily extraction of oil per well is 
shrinking correspondingly: from 29 tonnes in 1975 to 19 tonnes 
in 1985, and 10 tonnes in 1991-1993. 
  Deposits of pit coal are being exploited to a much smaller 
degree (around 14 percent of the recorded reserves and 23 
percent of the total number of deposits with an overall volume 
of 202 billion tonnes--12 percent of world reserves). The share 
of explored reserves of high-grade coking coal and anthracite, 
which are in short supply, however, amounts to just 12 percent 
of the total reserves in Russia. 
  Assimilation of deposits of lead, zinc, mercury, zirconium, 
and titanium is being delayed for a variety of reasons, 
including low quality of the ore, and technological and economic 
limitations. 
  The mining of gold is dominated by placer deposits (71.4 
percent of the total extracted), the explored reserves of which 
amount to only 26 percent of those recorded in the state 
balance. Reserves of placer gold in the main gold-mining regions 
will be exhausted in three to 15 years if high rates of 
extraction and the lag in geological prospecting work continue, 
which, on the basis of world criteria, is evaluated as a deep 
crisis of the raw material base. 
  At the same time, some of the largest indigenous gold ore 
deposits have not been assimilated (Sukhoy Log in Irkutsk 
Oblast, Vorontsov in Sverdlov Oblast, a number of deposits in 
the Northeastern region, Kamchatka, and Khabarovsk Kray). The 
bulk of the gold (around 60 percent) is mined in regions of the 
Russian Far North. The sharp rise in cost of energy sources, 
transportation, and other services may lower that share to 20-30 
percent in the immediate future. Compensation of such decreased 
extraction by other regions is impossible, because the raw 
material base is not prepared. 
  The needs of Russian industry for manganese, chrome, 
mercury, 
antimony, titanium, and a number of other types of mineral raw 
material is satisfied almost in full by deliveries from former 
Union republics. In 1993 884,000 tonnes of chrome ore was 
delivered to Russia from Kazakhstan, along with 10-12 million 
tonnes of commercial-grade iron ore and 206,000 tonnes of 
manganese ore from Ukraine. Mineral raw material imported in 
1993 cost Russia a total of $2 billion. 
  Reserves in the old raw material regions are running out. 
The 
annually expanding reserves are worked by oil extracting 
enterprises of the North Caucasus and the Volga Region, and by 
many lead, zinc, tin, and gold mines and mining combines. 
  There is a lag in the preparation of reserves of 
ecologically 
protected underground water to be supplied for drinking. Until 
now, around 50 percent of the cities and populated points in 
Russia, including up to 80 cities with a population of over 
250,000, utilize surface water unprotected from pollution 
(Moscow, St. Petersburg, Vologda, Kostroma, Kirov, Astrakhan, 
Kurgan, Chelyabinsk, Perm, Omsk, and other cities). The rate at 
which reserves of ecologically protected underground water 
sources are being prepared remains low. 
  Complex and specialized geological enterprises, as well as 
those that have paid orders to satisfy state needs and direct 
contracts are being preserved. 
  One of the most important directions in the development of 
geological prospecting work is the creation of modern 
enterprises and performance of work for foreign clients. The 
joint venture Polyarnoye Siyaniye company for the development of 
the Ardalin group of oil fields is the largest one. Geological 
prospecting work was performed on the basis of contracts with 
foreign firms by the state enterprise 
Krasnoleninskneftegazgeologiya ($1 million) as well as 
geophysical work by the government enterprise Yeniseygeofizika 
($1.5 million), and by others. In 1993 the joint venture 
Dalpacific Minerals in Khabarovsk Kray concluded contracts for 
an overall amount of more than $250,000. 
  The joint venture Geoylbent and the SANK [expansion not 
given] Urengoyl were also established in 1993. A number of other 
joint ventures are in the stage of formation. This year it is 
planned to increase the volume of foreign investments fourfold. 
  In 1991-1992 several geological expeditions whose workers 
get 
higher wages and benefits received at mining enterprises as 
compared with geological enterprises of the Russian Federation 
Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources, were 
transferred to the group of mining enterprises. 
  The most important premises for structural transformation 
consist in privatization and auctioning of enterprises. At 
present a decision has been made regarding privatization of 27 
geological enterprises and materials on 45 organizations are 
being prepared by the GKI [State Property Committee] of Russia 
and its local organs. 
  A legislative and standardization base was created for the 
use of mineral resources, which is founded on joint management 
of mineral resources of the Russian Federation and its subjects, 
and on the licensing of the use of mineral resources, including 
paid use, (as of 1 April 1994 6,591 licenses were issued for the 
right to use mineral resources).

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Baranovskiy: "President of the Russian </F>
Federation Has Been Mindful of Geology Problems: Head of State 
Believes That the Condition of the Mineral-Raw Material Base Is 
Not Only an Economic Matter but Also a Geopolitical One"; 
Vladimir Orlov later referred to as Viktor Orlov] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin discussed prospects for the 
development of Russia's mineral-raw materials base and problems 
of the country's geological service with the chairman of the 
Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of 
Mineral Resources, Vladimir Orlov, for an hour on 25 May. 
  Vladimir Orlov, in an interview with a SEGODNYA 
correspondent, explained what prompted his meeting with the 
president and its possible consequences. 
  According to the chairman of the Russian Federation State 
Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources, 
economically useful minerals and products from the primary 
processing of these minerals are, and will remain for the 
foreseeable future, the basic source of foreign exchange 
receipts for the state treasury. Thus, if all of Russia's 
material assets now being used are estimated at about $2 
trillion, then proven economically useful mineral reserves that 
have been entered on the state balance sheet equal about $28 
trillion. According to calculations of experts, all the free 
capital on the planet is not enough to master Russian fields. 
  At present, according to all parameters of per capita 
consumption of basic strategic forms of resources, Russia lags 
behind the West by two to five times. Thus, according to the 
president, it is necessary not to take the path of reducing 
consumption of resources, but to qualitatively change the 
structure of consumption. And, the market will force, and is 
already forcing, conservation of resources, in terms of use per 
unit of national product. A reduction of the entire mining and 
mineral extraction complex is now taking place, necessitating in 
the current period the activization of a purposeful state policy 
with respect to this issue. 
  Weak spots in the development of Russia's raw materials base 
and ways of overcoming them were discussed in the conversation. 
The president emphasized in the first place that Russia, as a 
great power, should and does have "raw materials" interests not 
only in the countries of the CIS but in the whole world as well, 
including the world's oceans (in particular, the president, in 
the course of the discussion, repeatedly showed interest in the 
development of technology and equipment for underwater 
extraction of economically useful minerals). In other words, 
problems in developing Russia's mineral-raw materials base have 
a geopolitical as well as an economic character. 
  Boris Yeltsin was interested in the reasons for the decline 
in oil and gold extraction, and the state of affairs with 
respect to other strategic forms of raw materials, especially 
those that have remained outside Russia. Of particular concern 
to him was how quickly and at what cost the problem could be 
solved. In this respect, the president expressed understanding 
of the fact that geologists' work yields a return in 10 to 15 
years and that the euphoria over the so-called "excess of proven 
reserves" of mineral resources is quickly passing. Meanwhile, 
investments in the mining and extraction industry yield a 
sufficiently rapid return. For example, in explored fields, it 
is possible to begin industrial extraction of oil in 1.5 to 
three years, scattered gold--in 1.5 to two years, and gold 
ore--in four to five years (at most seven years). 
  In connection with this, variants for attracting additional 
investment, including by the state, were examined, as was the 
question about what is blocking the attraction of domestic and 
foreign investment in the country's mining and mineral 
extraction complex. 
  A second set of questions concerned the organization of the 
geological service in Russia, which recently has undergone major 
changes and, as a result, has broken up into two components. The 
smaller of these (15 percent of overall expenditures in geology) 
is linked to providing for Federation-wide needs, including 
defense, and is financed through the budget. Included here are 
drilling of very deep wells, space programs, drawing geological 
maps on a small and intermediate scale, predictions of 
earthquakes, work in the world's oceans and the antarctic. Work 
of this kind is financed through the state budget in practically 
all countries in the world. 
  The remaining 85 percent of geological expenditures go to 
providing for current requirements in mining and mineral 
extraction, and related branches. These expenditures are 
financed through clients' funds. 
  Measures for state support of the development of Russia's 
mineral-raw materials base and geological service will be 
discussed on 7 June at a meeting of the commission for 
operational questions in the government. In this connection, the 
chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Geology 
and the Use of Mineral Resources noted that geologists were less 
in need of new budget infusions than of a resolution of the 
nonpayments problem. 
  In accordance with the system introduced as of 1 January 
this 
year, all payments for utilization of mineral resources and 
taxes remain with regional geological enterprises. However, this 
has not substantially affected their financial position. By way 
of an example, Viktor Orlov [name as published] showed the 
correspondent from the newspaper SEGODNYA a letter from the 
general director of the association Tomskneftegazgeologiya, Mr. 
Frinovskiy, saying that Tomsk oil workers had not paid R6.3 
billion for work carried out in 1993. They had only given the 
geologists the right to sell part of the oil extracted for R4 
billion and to keep the money for themselves. According to the 
chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Geology 
and the Use of Mineral Resources, if the nonpayment problem is 
solved, then the mechanism developed by the geologists for 
fulfilling the work on Federation-wide and commercial orders 
will function properly. 
  Viktor Orlov touched on the possible consequences of 
abolishing quotas and licenses in exporting oil. In his opinion, 
the consequences of this act will probably turn out to be very 
unfortunate for the geologists, who last year extracted about 3 
million tonnes of oil and exported practically all of it. In 
connection with the reduction in budgetary allocations of almost 
90 percent, income from oil exports allowed the geologists only 
to support social welfare activities. And, in recent years, 
about 30 percent of all expenditures in geology have gone to 
these. And, this in spite of the fact that the excise tax rate 
for geologists was the very highest--24 percent. Taking into 
account that geologists extract oil in absolutely uninhabited 
places, where there are no pipelines and the extracted oil has 
to be shipped in gasoline tankers and mainly on winter roads, 
the imposition of a customs duty of 30 ECUs per tonne can 
completely undermine the social welfare sphere. Thus, one of the 
questions to be examined by the commission for operational 
questions on 7 June will be the abolition of excise taxes. For 
now, Viktor Orlov is not taking it upon himself to predict how 
the question will be decided. 
  Work abroad on a commercial basis has become another avenue 
for obtaining additional funds for geologists. At present, at 
least 10 agreements have been concluded with countries in which 
during the USSR era geological exploration work was conducted. 
But, geologists then worked using state credits. The new 
agreements create not only new working places, but also a base 
for supplying Russia with economically useful minerals that are 
now in short supply for the national economy. (A classic example 
is bauxite, large reserves of which have not been found on 
Russian territory for over 60 years.) For at least another 15 
years, the country will import certain mineral raw materials. 
And, even after that, imports of mineral raw materials could 
increase. 
  In concluding the interview with the SEGODNYA correspondent, 
Viktor Orlov pointed to the growing interest in mineral 
resources on the part of all regimes. If success is reached in 
resolving the nonpayments problem and in adopting the package of 
documents talked about above, then the volume of geological 
exploration work will achieve the optimal level, which will 
constitute half of the most that was achieved in the 1980's. 
  With respect to the present condition of Russia's 
mineral-raw materials base, see also page 13.)

<F P=106> [Commentary: "Competent Opinion: Businessmen on the </F>
President's Edicts"] 
  [Text] Valeriy Neverov, president of the Germes [Hermes] 
Concern: 
  "To comment on the president's edicts is very simple. 
Previously, from every earned ruble [R], the state attempted to 
take from us taxes in the amount of R1.20-1.30 and now the 
amount is R1.70-1.80. There is no difference -- it is impossible 
to survive all the same. So we looked for loopholes in the 
legislation and we will continue to look for them. In commercial 
circles, the conviction is getting stronger that the state has 
taken a course for the destruction of the non-state sector. I do 
not think that this is an advisable and well-considered policy, 
rather, it is a confirmation of the authorities' helplessness. 
Do you remember the anecdote? When a brothel does not work, it 
is necessary to change the personnel. First and foremost, those 
whose length of party membership is more than 20 years." 
  "But, seriously, the economic problems lie in the 
non-economic area. The Russian people cannot be without an 
ideology and a philosophy. At one time, both Mikhail Gorbachev 
and Boris Yeltsin were symbols of change. The people were 
enthusiastic. The people gave them a measure of trust. Now they 
tell us: let him who can, enrich himself, let him who cannot, 
die, and whoever does not die, we will run down ourselves. This 
is not an ideology. Russians have been constructed in such a 
fashion that they have always received energy from the future 
and have always lived on hope for the coming day. And now it is 
not financial stabilization which can defeat inflation, but 
rather, only a new ideology." 
  "Of course, a change in leadership is not a sufficient 
condition, but it is necessary." 
  Mikhail Lapshin, president of AO [Joint-Stock Company] 
Brokers Trading House: 
  "The position of the state, which is giving the raw 
materials 
market directly to the suppliers, is quite clear: to remove the 
superfluous bureaucratic link. To date, direct ties with the 
buyers have already been set up. As for licensing, it has lost 
all meaning at present: Russia's raw materials market has 
already been established, so that an outsider has almost no 
chance of obtaining access to the raw materials. On the whole, 
however, the abolition of export quotas and licenses is quite 
sensible and is leading only to the emergence of civilized 
relations with Western partners. First, the suppliers will not 
be wasting time overcoming the protection barrier. Second, it 
will be possible to actually participate in the competitive 
struggle and to not pay bribes in order to obtain quotas." 
  Aleksey Vlasov, president of the RTSB: 
  "Too many people are feeding from this large trough to let 
this decree pass so calmly. That is, it can be adopted, be 
worked out very well, but be stuck somewhere at the level of a 
very average bureaucratic system. As for the registration of 
accounts, obviously, this is an attempt by the tax inspectorate 
to obtain data about the taxpayers' incomes. The fact that the 
necessity of the reporting violates my rights is not what is 
troublesome. It seems to me that this burden is too much for the 
tax service." 
  "It is very likely that I will go to the tax inspectorate 
and 
there they will explain for 2 months which information form is 
needed and it will be necessary to write three times a night in 
order to obtain it." 
  Petr Korotkov, chairman of the RTSB's exchange board: 
  "The president's edicts are of an intellectual management 
nature. Now it is the government's business to implement them." 
  "The abolition of quotas is aimed at the elimination of 
monopolism. Our economy is being gradually transformed from a 
monopoly type to a comprador-concern [buyer-seller] type." 
  "The time has come to reduce the level of the rates 
collected 
from enterprises. But as for raising the level of the taxation 
of natural persons' incomes, it will be difficult to implement 
this." 
  "The Edict on the Implementation of Integrated Measures for 
the Timely and Complete Submission of Taxes and Other Obligatory 
Payments to the Budget provides for the opening of a current 
account only upon the presentation of a document which confirms 
the establishment of registration in the tax organ. But it has 
always been so. Otherwise, it is a violation. The fact that we 
have no such legislation is another matter." 
  Andrey Fetisov, deputy chairman of the RTSB's exchange 
board: 
  "It is possible to talk about what is known and about the 
specific mechanism for implementation. But it is still early to 
talk about this. After all, a tax inspector, for example, does 
not act at all according to the edict, but rather, according to 
his own department's instructions. But I cannot yet give a 
specific commentary as I need to examine the edicts seriously. 
Unfortunately, neither edict nor law determine the rules by 
which we are acting, but rather, semi-legal acts." 
  Sergey Mishin, broker: 
  "To be honest, I have not read them, I have read a 
restatement of these edicts in KOMMERSANT. But any restatement 
subjectively reflects the essence of what has been written. In 
principle, the simpler a system is, the more reliable it is. The 
desire to simplify the tax system can only be welcomed. After 
all, the more complicated this system is, the simpler it is to 
escape from it. The fact that this problem was tackled is good. 
But, since I have not yet read the edicts themselves, I cannot 
analyze them further. The president tackled these problems and 
that is good, really good. It would seem that the overall 
direction is a normal one." 
  Aleksandr Deduchenko, manager of the RTSB: 
  "When you read the documents, you will form your own 
opinion. 
But I have not yet read the documents, I have only heard a 
commentary. But we know from experience that a commentary is one 
thing, but when we carefully read a document, we see something 
completely different. We shall see what we shall see!" 
  Andrey Kushnirenko, deputy chief of the RF MVES' [Russian 
Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] Foreign 
Economic Activities Main Administration: 
  "The edict's text states that the setting of quotas for and 
the licensing of Russian exports remain in effect for those 
goods and services with respect to which Russia has 
corresponding international obligations. These obligations can 
be divided into two categories:" 
  "-- the first is: Russia has made a commitment to limit its 
exporting with respect to textiles, aluminum and diamonds, as 
well as materials and items associated with weapons of mass 
destruction, missile technology, poisons, narcotics and 
dual-purpose goods;" 
  "-- the second is: the export licenses and quotas are being 
maintained in fulfillment of Russia's treaties and agreements 
which have been signed on an international level and which 
Russia is obligated to fulfill. For example, the delivery to 
Cuba of 2.5 million metric tons of oil in exchange for sugar." 
  "In the near future, a governmental decree will be issued 
with respect to export quotas and licenses and then it will be 
possible to talk about this matter in more detail." 
  Boris Bolotin, doctor of economic sciences and senior 
scientific associate of the IMEMO RAN [Russian Academy of 
Sciences' World Economics and International Relations Institute]: 
  "The adopted decrees are not impromptu and an 
improvisation." 
  "The recently promulgated presidential edicts do not 
signify, 
in my opinion, a repudiation of the former course of the 
reforms. They are more a response to the inaction of the State 
Duma and the government. Indeed, after Boris Yeltsin's economic 
message received general approval, the honorable deputies did 
not adopt a single corresponding law." 
  "The most important one, in my opinion, the edict on the 
transformation of state enterprises into public ones, is the 
first logical attempt to designate the ways and methods for 
influencing the economic processes. Now it is impossible to 
permit the failure of those 5,300 enterprises which have 
remained state property after privatization. We are talking 
about 60 percent of the country's production capacities, a large 
portion of which is on the brink of bankruptcy. More than 2,000 
enterprises are situated in small and medium-sized cities which 
actually live on them. If they are denied support, the people 
will find themselves on life's sideline. No relatively 
responsible government should permit this." 
  "The utterances about the fact that inefficient enterprises 
need to be closed while social benefits are paid to the workers 
have become somewhat outdated by now. Moreover, practice has 
shown that we are incapable of carrying out such programs 
competently. When they started talking about the conversion and 
closing of defense enterprises and the redirecting of resources 
to civilian enterprises, Western financial assistance in the 
amount of $25-30 billion was supposed to prevent the conversion 
from turning into a detonator for a social explosion." 
  "However, instead of this, humanitarian aid arrived, which 
did not even apply to the defense-industry workers." 
  "Thus, the people have been brought to the brink of despair 
and the decision adopted by the president is the best one to 
date. First, it permits Mr. Yeltsin, at the upcoming meeting in 
Naples, to seek Western assistance for specific goals which can 
ensure social peace and stability. Second, now there is a 
guarantee that 10 million workers will not find themselves on 
the street." 
  "The abolition of quota-setting and licenses is also a quite 
natural step. Especially if you remember the decree issued at 
the beginning of May on their restriction. It is no secret that 
the 27-28 percent production slump in the first half of this 
year in relation to the same period for last year, to a 
significant degree, is the result of the lack of a solvent 
demand within the country. This is why the removal of the export 
restrictions is very important now. However, this, 
unfortunately, does not mean that the West is ready to accept 
our goods." 
  "The tightening up of currency and tax control has been 
caused by the same need to intensify the state's participation 
in the country's economy. If Western estimates are to be 
believed, every month, export currency earnings of Russian 
enterprises ranging from $1.5 billion to $2 billion are either 
slipping away to the West or remaining there. And, in addition 
to this, according to the latest data, the state is being 
shorted around 40 percent of the taxes. Considering the budget 
deficit, it is clear that control is necessary." 
  "How to carry it out is another matter. A decree requiring 
the banks to inform the tax organs about clients' financial 
transactions contradicts the generally accepted norms. 
Throughout the entire world there exists the concept of banking 
privacy, while financial control is handled by special organs." 
  "Thus, it is perfectly obvious that, despite the substantial 
imperfections, the adopted decrees are not impromptu and not an 
improvisation. However, it is not clear why the introduction of 
new market principles is occurring by means of declarations and 
edicts of the president. Especially since the range of 
competence of our government is quite limited and the solving of 
economic problems is a direct sphere of its activities." 
  In discussing the progress of economic reform in Russia in 
the "Economy and Entrepreneurship" section, the participants of 
the first international Slavic-Eurasian congress of figures of 
science, culture and entrepreneurship, which took place in 
Novgorod, did not ignore the president's latest decrees on 
economic matters. 
  The deputy governor of Nizhegorodskaya [Oblast] and director 
of the Department of Economics and Forecasting, Vasiliy Kozlov, 
at the request of an ITAR-TASS correspondent, commented on these 
documents as follows: "There should be a positive assessment of 
the president's good will and his understanding of the two most 
critical problems -- the lowering of taxes for producers, which 
was evoked by the extraordinary slump in production, which 
reached, for example, 30 percent in Nizhegorodskaya Oblast, and 
the need to improve the financial system. It is no accident that 
the lion's share of the edicts' text has been devoted to the 
state's fiscal policy and the replenishment of its treasury. The 
documents contain an appeal to the government, to [Russian] 
Federation entities and to parties and movements to submit the 
needed suggestions on this matter and to think over measures for 
improving the tax policy, taking into account at the same time 
the deplorable experience of the past. The basic orientation 
should be a lowering of the tax rates." 
  According to him, the local group of managers "saw in the 
edicts not so much an easing of taxes as menacing restrictions 
which deprive the enterprises' managers of the last bits of 
'leeway' and maneuvering room. They consider the following to be 
obvious shortcomings of the Edict on the Reform of State 
Enterprises: the lack of a mechanism for determining the 
procedure for transferring an enterprise into the category of 
the public ones and the ban on changing the number of workers in 
a public enterprise in comparison with the previously existing 
federal state enterprise." 
  And here is the opinion of Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the 
Communists of Russia parliamentary faction, who participated in 
the work of the congress, which he expressed in a conversation 
with an ITAR-TASS correspondent: "Through these edicts, the 
president is actually taking upon himself the responsibility for 
the subsequent continuation of the reforms. But, after all, a 
mass of good decisions was also adopted previously, but they 
also did not produce the expected results." 
  RF Deputy Minister of Economics Sergey Vasilyev called RF 
President Boris Yeltsin's edict on the abolition of export 
quotas and licenses "a political decision which completes the 
final stage of the liberalization of Russia's economy." This is 
an extremely timely edict and a big step forward in the plan for 
the development of Russian exporting, he emphasized in the 
interview to a BIZNES-TASS correspondent. 
  Sergey Vasilyev noted especially the important significance 
of the president's edict for the country's oil industry. In our 
country, he said, a paradoxical situation has emerged with 
respect to oil exporting. Russia is seeing the overproduction of 
oil, the domestic consumer is not paying, the oil-producing and 
oil-refining enterprises are in a difficult position and the oil 
storage tanks are filled to the brim. Yet, at the same time, the 
administrative system established harsh regulatory conditions in 
the form of export quotas and licenses and exceeding these 
limits was prohibited. Now, instead of quotas and licenses, a 
system of duties is being established, which treats everyone the 
same. From each metric ton, the state is supposed to receive, in 
the form of a duty, 15 ECU [European Currency Unit] as against 
the current 35 ECU. 
  In principle, according to him, the abolition of the quotas 
will not lead to "an explosive increase in Russian oil exporting 
due to our limited capacities," however, it may be expected that 
there will be a substantial increase in shipments to the foreign 
market, which will undoubtedly make it possible to increase 
budget receipts. 
  Moreover, the deputy minister of economics noted, the 
abolition of the export quotas and licences destroys the last 
stronghold of the administrative-and-command system, eliminating 
a source of large-scale abuses and corruption in the state 
machinery.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yakov Ginzburg, candidate of economic </F>
sciences and vice president of the State Center Bank, by Vadim 
Yuryev, VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK correspondent; place and date not 
given: "Money Was the First To Withdraw"] 
  [Text] Well, finally, it happened--inflation went 
into a slump in recent months. And according to May's results, 
the government has every reason to celebrate yet another 
record--according to data of the Center for Economic Conditions, 
inflation amounted to only 8.1 percent last month. 
  Such a low indicator has not been seen in Russia since 
August 
of 1992. As a consequence of this, the Central Bank has begun to 
smoothly lower the cost of centralized credits. There is, it 
would seem, one more happy fact: Retail prices for consumer 
goods in the first quarter increased by only 45 percent--the 
lowest indicator for the last two years. But somehow there is no 
desire to rejoice over this--these victories on the financial 
front came at too high a price: Industrial enterprises are being 
shut down, unemployment is increasing, and the purchasing power 
of the population is dropping. Our correspondent asked Yakov 
Ginzburg, a candidate of economic sciences and now the vice 
president of the State Center Bank, to comment on the situation. 
Before this he was the director of the scientific-consultation 
and information center of the Association of Siberian and Far 
Eastern Cities. 
  [Yuryev] Yakov Sadkovich, can the sharp drop in the rate of 
inflation be considered an indication of approaching economic 
prosperity? 
  [Ginzburg] No. What is more, this, possibly, is approaching 
a 
very grave crisis, when there will be a shortage of both money 
and commodities. If we are talking about the situation in the 
country as a whole, then it should be noted that no fundamental 
changes have occurred yet. The level of inflation has been 
reduced by artificial methods--the tactic of postponed 
decisions. As before, the government is making decisions about 
the issuance of large credits, but those corporations that 
should receive them are including the promised money in 
estimates, and, counting on it, they are drawing up programs and 
plans, and sometimes they even take credits on the basis of 
expected credits, but once the additional money supply feeding 
does not occur, although the expenditure mechanism is 
functioning as before, then the pool gradually begins to dry up. 
I liked the expression of one of the television commentators: He 
said that we have been observing the competition between the 
amount of money and the amount of commodities for a long 
time--what will come to an end sooner? Now we see: Money was the 
first to withdraw. 
  But the requirement for money also fell--however strange 
this 
may sound. Because the rates for credits in banks were very 
high: Even our most profitable industry--trade--can no longer 
take money at 300 percent annual interest. And a paradoxical 
situation arose. While money was in short supply, a surplus of 
it developed--there was money in the banks, but they cannot give 
it to anyone at such a high percent--at such rates, a real 
return simply will not occur. (According to my data, the rate of 
unrecoverability has already reached a colossal level--80 
percent.) Therefore, in order to hold out in the system of 
monetary circulation, nothing is left for the banks to do but to 
make money more accessible; that is, to lower the cost of 
credit, which is what is occurring now. Incidentally, the 
situation on the interbank money exchanges is one more indicator 
that money has become in short supply. Note that the dollar 
exchange rate is increasing, but the volume of sales is 
continuously falling. Inasmuch as there is no free money, money 
is not coming to the currency market, either. 
  [Yuryev] But this situation in the financial sphere has most 
of all hit not banks, but industrial enterprises--it is they 
that are shutting down.... 
  [Ginzburg] Yes, the most unfortunate thing is that this 
situation could lead to a shutdown of industrial production; it 
cannot live without money. And nothing in the economic situation 
has occurred that would stimulate the development of production. 
The system of voucher circulation, which has been talked about 
so much for so long in the government, did not take root, and it 
did not become the means of overcoming the crisis of the system 
of nonpayments for various reasons. 
  [Yuryev] It turns out that the high level of inflation that 
there was, for example, last year, is a lesser evil in 
comparison with today's 8-9 percent inflation per month? 
  [Ginzburg] Yes, the spiraling inflation fed production at 
least through trade. But now even this feeding is 
disappearing--trade is becoming insolvent, and the volume of 
supply of goods has become threateningly large--commercial 
organizations are becoming overloaded with unsold commodities. 
Therefore, many trade organizations are now beginning to prepare 
in good time for the approaching crisis, which is forecast for 
autumn. 
  [Yuryev] How are they preparing? 
  [Ginzburg] They are selling commodities and not buying new 
ones. I judge this also because commercial banks have lately 
been receiving more and more proposals from trade enterprises 
about placing money into long-term deposits. 
  There is no sense in accusing our bankers, including 
Ginzburg 
as well, of a reluctance to support collapsing production. As 
was noted by one Western economist, money is cowardly--it will 
go only where there is a reliable legislative base, and it is 
clear what kind--a taxation system, political stability, and the 
like. But our country, from the standpoint of attractiveness for 
the investor, according to the assessments of American experts, 
is somewhere at the 150th place, yielding even to Vietnam. 
  For a resolution of all of these problems that scare off 
"cowardly" money, obviously, large financial resources are 
required. Where are they to be gotten? The answer to this 
question must lie in the state budget. But the budget for this 
year, it can be said, is already past, and it will not be able 
to play the role of a main financial plan. Thus, a lowering in 
the rates of inflation in the first half of the year, which, 
unquestionably, is an economic success, will have a positive 
effect only in the event that it is used for systemic 
reorganizations. Otherwise, the successes of the beginning of 
the year will turn out to be not more than a short pause in the 
many years of inflation increases, the consequences of which 
will be difficult to predict.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleksandr Kharchenko, UNIAN special for </F>
Post-Postup: "Landyk Left for a Tiny Candle Factory and His 
Flame Went Out"] 
  [Text] Deputy prime minister Valentyn Landyk 
submitted his resignation effective May 20. Although his 
resignation may not be accepted, these events indicate a change 
in his status. Landyk was in charge of the oil and gas complex, 
external economic relations, investments, allocation of 
financial resources, and coordination of privatization. All of 
these ventures were far from successful, but true to Ukrainian 
political traditions he was not held accountable and his 
resignation--if accepted--is entirely voluntary. 
  Landyk's views were well known. His monetary policy was that 
"in transition to a market economy prices will increase several 
fold!" As head of a committee responsible for managing hard 
currency Landyk was better informed than most about our 
disastrous situation: Ukraine can afford to import only 30 
percent of essential goods that she needs. In foreign trade he 
remained true to licenses, quotas, and strict control over 
exports, particularly the concentration of export trade in a 
hands of a few chosen exporters. He also favored moderate 
privatization. 
  Perhaps Landyk was best characterized at a press conference 
by his colleague Vasyl Yevtukhov: "When I became head of the 
USPP [Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs] I 
attempted to reconcile differences between entrepreneurs and 
industrialists, i.e., to integrate them. But I soon realized 
that they were one and the same; there was no need for an 
integration!" In Yukhym Zvyahilskyy's government Landyk was the 
prototype amphibian, both a government official and an owner of 
a `small candle-making concern' [in Russian] at the same time. 
After graduation from the Kramatorsk Industrial Institute he 
followed the usual career path: mechanical engineer, plant 
manager, secretary of the party committee, and director. As a 
director he was in time for the golden age of leasing and 
renting of state property. The Donetsk "Elektropobutmash" plant, 
for example, was initially leased and then transformed into the 
"Nord" stock company. Nord was founded in 1991 by the workers at 
the plant and the USSR Ministry of Defense with the latter 
getting "only 70 percent of the voting stock" and the workers 30 
percent. Now we can understand why some people are so worried 
about "dissolution of economic ties with Russia" and favor "a 
single economic market." Such abuses in ownership of state 
property--which took place under the aegis of the parliamentary 
moratorium declared on November 11, 1990--were declared illegal 
by the Ukrainian parliament on February 14, 1992. As a Donetsk 
newspaper pointed out--Nord management ignored the legislation 
and at an international exhibit in Moscow this year did not even 
raise the Ukrainian flag as did our other enterprises. We can 
also understand much better the psychology of the owner of a 
small candle-making concern who feels that access to hard 
currency should be restricted to a selected few. 
  But we have to give Landyk his due. He never pretended to be 
a reformer or a liberal and never used the rhetoric of the 
`Harvard boys', although tact and such rhetoric might have been 
useful in international relations in securing credits and 
investments. Take for example the discussion Landyk and Valeriy 
Shmarov had with Nichols Burns [sic], a senior directors of the 
American National Security Council [sic]. The deputy prime 
ministers made it clear that Ukraine will not undertake reforms 
`immediately' [in English], that there is a `Ukrainian road to 
capitalism', and so forth, but that the Western countries should 
provide money for this capitalism at once. 
  Having spent a year as a curator of privatization and 
foreign 
economic relations, and appreciating the indefinite nature of 
his job, Landyk--like so many of his friends--decided to run for 
parliament. In the Lenin electoral district of Donetsk he 
defeated a communist, and the only ward he lost was one where he 
was portrayed as a rabid nationalist and savior of the Ukrainian 
state. And so, on May 20, the deputy prime minister declared his 
desire to be a deputy rather than a "whipping boy". 
  But what is the real reason for this move? If Roman Shpek 
were to become the new prime minister there would be no reason 
for Landyk to leave the government. If, on the other hand, 
Zvyahilskyy were to remain in office then the relationship 
between them would be strained. The problem started with the 
stock holding company Ukrnaftohaz which was promoted by Landyk 
and opposed by Zvyahilskyy ("Over my dead body!", if rumors are 
to be believed). Nevertheless, the president signed the company 
into existence on May 14 and even though the Zvyahilskyy was 
seen alive thereafter, Landyk had overstepped his bounds and had 
to leave. 
  Landyk may feel that he wasted eleven months of his life in 
the Cabinet of Ministers. But the fact remains that inflation 
has been controlled (never mind the means!), Ukraine's 
involvement with CIS has been limited to that of an associate, 
Ukrnaftohaz has been created, and Nord has escaped bankruptcy. 
Who will follow him? Most like another 'strong man" with a 
little candle-making business on the side. Deputy prime minister 
Shmarov has already started making his move, having made offers 
of jobs in the future cabinet to industrial directors.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Stafanets, Chernivtsi: "Reunification </F>
of Bukovyna with Romania Landed in Court"] 
  [Text] In Chernivtsi the Press Office of the Oblast 
Administration has again taken the newspaper "Play Rominesk" 
(Romanian Region) to court in the Pershotravnevyy Rayon. This 
action followed a series of incendiary articles seeking to sow 
mistrust, engender tensions, and question the validity of 
international border agreements. Many in Chernivtsi feel that it 
is high time that the Romanian Culturological Society imeni 
Eminesku, of which the Play is the official publication, should 
be held accountable for their campaign. The issues are complex 
since Romanians make up 20% of the electorate, a fact not 
lost 
on local politicians. 
  Even the most tolerant of stoics would be annoyed by the 
activities of the Eminesku society which, from its very 
beginnings in the 90s, always had more to do with politics than 
culture. The leaders, Oleksadryna Chernova, Iliye Zehrya, Vasyl 
Teretsanov, speculate on Ukrainian poverty with a variety of 
changing demands: now a Romanian university in Chernivtsi, then 
special privileges for Romanian-speaking conscripts, or finally 
dual Ukrainian-Romanian citizenship. Their inspiration comes 
from the Christian Democratic Alliance of Romanians in Ukraine 
which is registered in Kiev, although its activity is limited to 
Chernivtsi. Recently the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice had to 
caution the Alliance about interfering in government affairs. 
  Their activism peaked in 1992 when the new Ukrainian state 
was coming into its own and many Moldavian village councils in 
Chernivtsi region seized the opportunity to raise the Romanian 
tricolors. At that time there were already six Romanian 
societies, but the Eminesku group strove for pre-eminence as the 
true torch bearers and martyrs of the `Romanian idea'. Romanian 
press reports indicate that at the end of 1993 the editor of 
Play Rominesk, Teretsanov, had received the National Prize of 
the "Greater Romania Fund" for his poetic and journalistic works 
on behalf of reunification of Bukovyna with its Romanian mother, 
all of which he is said to have accomplished despite savage 
persecution. 
  But Bukovyna is not a festering boil like the Transdniester. 
While Teretsanov hankers for laurels from Iliescu for his 
martyrdom--and there are many politicians in Romania ready to 
finance his activities--there is no hope that the Ukrainian 
government or local authorities will play along by arresting and 
executing him. In the meantime, the Eminesku society has to put 
up with 55 kindergartens and 86 schools with Romanian as the 
language of instruction, a chair of Romanian language at the 
university, Romanian organizations at educational institutions, 
reinstitution of historical placenames, as well as friendly 
relations between Ukrainians and Moldavians. This is true not 
only of Ukraine, but also of Moldova. The Moldavians and 
Romanians in the Ren district of the Odessa region can only hope 
for the tolerant conditions prevalent in Chernivtsi. 
  Still, various Romanian national fronts and some deputies in 
the Romanian parliament have set out to save their compatriots 
in Ukraine. They seek solace in the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact to 
support their pretensions to Ukrainian territory, ignoring 
subsequent international treaties. Some recent improvements in 
Ukrainian-Romanian relations are due to the visit of Adrian 
Nastase, the speaker of the Romanian parliament, to Ukraine and 
the Chernivtsi Oblast. However, politicians in Chernivtsi feel 
that even highly placed Romanian politicians question the 
present borders but, in distinction to the radical elements, are 
willing to wait for a more opportune time to strike. This 
supposition is supported by the recurring demands in the 
Romanian press for recovery of `historical lands' and 
allegations by the official Romanian press agency, Rompress, 
that Romanians are deprived of opportunities for professional 
education. 
  More likely, having been soundly rejected in Moldova, the 
adherents of "Greater Romania" feel they have to seek new lands 
to conquer for their raison d'etre. Without a chronic struggle 
for some imaginary Romanian lands they run the risk of being 
relegated to the lunatic fringe even in Bucharest itself. In 
Bukovyna they miscalculated when the Ukrainian authorities 
simply let the law take its course.

<F P=106> [Article by Serhiy Trashutin: "The Sibinkor Empire"] </F>
  [Text] 
<H5>  Deputy Speaker </H5>
  Kharkov--Oleh Dyomin was born in 1942. He is Russian, and 
has 
a college education. He has great experience in party and 
economic work. Dyomin was the first secretary of the 
Kominternovskiy Rayon Committee, and later a secretary of the 
CPSU Kharkov City Committee. After the CPSU was banned, he moved 
on to the Ukrainian-Siberian investment corporation as vice 
president. He is president of the Prospect 21 foundation. Dyomin 
calls himself a nonparty member. He did not engage in political 
activities between September 1991 and the moment of his 
nomination for the Supreme Council. He was nominated for the 
post of mayor in Kharkov, but withdrew as a candidate after his 
election as deputy speaker. 
<H5>  The Election </H5>
  The candidate was nominated in Kominternovskiy Electoral 
District No. 371 by a group of voters, the labor collective of 
the Budhidroprylad state enterprise, and Motor Vehicle Pool 
16,328. During the election campaign he drew on his old 
connections in the rayon since the time of his tenure as 
secretary. He was virtually the only candidate whose victory was 
predicted unanimously by the political observers of Kharkov. He 
did not shrink from directly flirting with voters, for example, 
as he spoke on 8 March in the imeni Artem park before members of 
the Soldiers' Brotherhood club of veterans, he arranged for a 
free smorgasbord and presents for the wives packaged in 
brand-name paper bags with Ukrsybinkor labels. In the first 
round he got 24.4 percent, and his closest rival--9.4 percent. 
In the second round he got 53.54 percent, or 31.2 percent of the 
total number of voters. His political views--a supporter of the 
Chinese way and strong centralized power. His vision of 
transformations is in keeping with this pattern: economic 
reform, reform of social consciousness, reform of the political 
system. He believes that only a soviet political system is 
capable of conducting economic reform in the direction of the 
market. For this reason he denounces the destruction of this 
system. He calls the 1 December referendum a "deception of the 
people" because "the people were in favor of independence but 
within the Union." The introduction of the coupon was a tragedy 
and a national disgrace. "Ukraine has been ripped out of the 
ruble zone!" About the Belovezha agreements: "Unfortunately, the 
personal mercenary interests of individual princelings prevailed 
rather than the interests of the people." For this reason it is 
"necessary to resume relations with Russia to the full extent 
not only in the economic but also in the military-political 
sphere." Dyomin's participation, along with that of Sibinkor 
President Taranov, in the proceedings of a roundtable panel of 
the representatives of centrist forces of the three independent 
states in Kharkov on 21 May 1994 is explained precisely by this 
vision of relations between Ukraine and Russia. 
  Together with another group of moneybags, he signed a 
declaration before the second round of voting to deflect 
accusations about forming an anticommunist bloc. The declaration 
said in particular: "An anticommunist bloc is out of the 
question. All of us are the children of our motherland and our 
time. We know well, perhaps better than others, what our country 
achieved under socialism and how many people were inspired and 
propelled into battle and labor by the communist idea. We do not 
renounce our convictions at present, either. 
<H5>  Prospects </H5>
  The Unity group of deputies, which in addition to Dyomin, 
the 
residents of Kharkov Taranov, the Sibinkor president, Alekseyev 
(Civic Congress of Ukraine) and Chornousenko (SBU) [Ukrainian 
Security Service] joined, was established on a nonparty basis on 
the principles of counteracting the spread of "dense 
nationalism," mutually advantageous economic relations with 
Russia, and putting the economy in order. They quickly found a 
common language with the left. The latter, lacking a real 
program for overcoming the crisis, agreed to yield a string of 
key positions to their allies (Taranov's appointment as head of 
the economic policy commission). The new postcommunist 
bourgeoisie which comes from the communist circles suits them 
just fine because it voices (at least publicly) views that are 
quite close to theirs. On the other hand, it may serve as a 
guide of sorts to the future. Under the circumstances, Hrynyov 
and his ilk are the losers because this new bourgeoisie has come 
to power itself, and it no longer needs the services of overly 
talkative and continuously hungry intermediaries. Power is 
gradually acquiring the features of an oligarchy. This, in turn, 
indicates that a quite stable trend toward some kind of 
Chinese-Latin American way of sociopolitical development has 
emerged in Ukraine. 
  FROM THE FILES OF POST-POSTUP: The origins of the 
Ukrsybinkor joint-stock company date back to the moment of the 
creation in 1991 of the Universal Ukrainian-Siberian Exchange 
(UUSB), of which the Rapid plant (director, Taranov) and the 
organizations of the city of Tyumen were founders. In 1992 the 
AT [Joint-Stock Company] Ukrsybinkor investment corporation was 
created with a statutory fund of R250 million. Hundreds of 
enterprises from the former USSR are its shareholders. In 1992 
the controlling share of the Kharkivvinkombank was purchased, 
which was transformed into the Ukrsybbank. At present there are 
more than 30 enterprises and institutions in the joint-stock 
company, including a plant for recycling precious metals. The 
sphere of operations of the joint-stock company includes 
production, commercial, intermediary, and banking services, and 
glass production. Since summer 1992 the USB [Ukrainian-Siberian 
Exchange] has engaged in the sale of Russian weapons (planes, 
tanks, artillery systems, air defense materiel, and firearms). 
For example, on 28 January 1993 a delivery of weapons worth more 
than $2 billion was put up for sale. The AT Ukrsybinkor has its 
own guard in the form of the 250-strong Alfa-Profi detachment of 
the guardians of legal order set up under the aegis of the 
Prospect 21 foundation. All of them have the certificates of 
auxiliary militia employees. The detachment was actively used 
during Oleg Taranov's election campaign. On one occasion this 
resulted in a noisy scandal when its combatants seized in the 
street citizens who were pasting up anti-Taranov leaflets. 
  The USB engages in extensive charitable activities, 
supporting the development of children's athletics in 
particular. People's Deputy Taranov is president of the AT 
Ukrsybinkor. Dyomin, the deputy speaker and people's deputy, is 
vice president.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Why Does Ukraine Need a Prime </F>
Minister As Early As June?"] 
  [Text] The issue concerning the formation of a new cabinet 
before the presidential elections surfaced rather suddenly. The 
practically simultaneous announcements made by the president and 
the speaker on the need for such a step makes one think of the 
classic question--"To whose advantage is that"? 
  From the viewpoint of common sense, the need to form a 
cabinet with the unclear chances of the current president in the 
elections appears sufficiently doubtful. It is understandable 
that Leonid Kravchuk is specifically the one standing to lose 
the least of all from the possible consequences of such a step. 
His actions fit ideally within the scheme of the pre-election 
struggle--the president is so certain of himself that he is 
already forming a government with which he will work in the 
future. In case of victory this will serve to enhance his 
popularity, while if he comes in last there is nothing to lose. 
The only miscalculation by the president is his recognition of 
the Supreme Council. Up to now Leonid Makarovich has practically 
ignored the parliament. Kravchuk's answer to a question from a 
deputy--"Why didn't you congratulate us on our election?" is 
quite indicative. The president allowed himself a joke in the 
Odessa style: "If that would help you with your work I would be 
congratulating you three times every day." Since Leonid Kravchuk 
is proposing a candidate for premier to the Supreme Council, he 
consequently recognizes the fact of its existence and the role 
it is called upon to play. That is an insignificant 
miscalculation--should Leonid Kravchuk become president once 
again he will have to deal with parliament in one way or another 
anyway. 
  The advantages that will be gained by the Supreme Council 
and 
concretely by Aleksandr Moroz are quite doubtful. Moroz, of 
course, could have made such announcements on purely 
propagandistic grounds--you see, despite everything, we are 
insisting on decisive actions, the first of which is replacement 
of the government. By the way, it is possible to delay such 
activity, since two weeks in "big politics" mean nothing. If the 
government is selected before the presidential elections, the 
Supreme Council will find itself in a difficult situation--it 
bears responsibility for the government. All the presidential 
candidates, including Leonid Makarovich, would be very happy 
with such a turn of events. The fact that a government exists 
affords the possibility of getting a rest from pre-election 
battles and marshalling strength for the coming struggle. At the 
same time everything that is taking place in the country can be 
calmly written off to the government and the parliament that has 
joined it. Moreover, the existence of a "people's" government 
simply condemns the future president to a struggle with 
parliament (with the exception of the case when Moroz himself 
becomes president, which is unlikely). The result of that 
struggle is known beforehand--executive power always wins in the 
struggle between authorities inasmuch as it has greater 
mobility. It is also necessary to take into account our own 
specifics, which are that it is practically impossible to have 
the president resign. 
  It is possible to allow that Aleksandr Aleksandrovich's goal 
is to discredit Leonid Makarovich yet again, rejecting all his 
nominees for the post of premier. But in reality Kravchuk only 
stands to gain from such a biathlon--everyone already knows of 
his "decisiveness" and "desire to work," while those who doubt 
this will also take the side of the president inasmuch as 
psychologically the position of the proposing side is the 
winning one. In addition to that, the speaker must be interested 
in such an active struggle with the president, that is, he must 
have a certain understanding with the other proposed 
candidate--Leonid Kuchma. For Kuchma, in turn, the stake in such 
a game may be nothing less than his loyalty to the Supreme 
Council, while any gain is quite insignificant, if it exists at 
all.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine by </F>
Mariya Bazelyuk, conducted in Kiev on the eve of the president's 
visit to Lviv: " 'I Will Never Allow Ukraine To Return to 
Communist Times' "] 
  [Text] 
  [Bazelyuk] Mr. President, we will soon be celebrating the 
third anniversary of Ukraine's independence. How much stronger 
has Ukraine grown as an independent state in this time? 
  [Kravchuk] In connection with the presidential election, I 
have recently been spending more time in the collectives, 
meeting with people locally, in Kiev and Kiev Oblast, in 
Mykolayiv, Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Zhytomyr oblasts. And I can 
tell you without exaggeration that I have seen that the things 
that are happening on the surface and that are represented in 
official and unofficial interpretations and in information 
presented by various mass media, parties, and movements simply 
do not reflect the mood of the people, nor what has already been 
accomplished even in the most difficult sphere of all for us -- 
the economy. Kharkiv Oblast is a large, comprehensively 
developed region, with over three million inhabitants: it has a 
machinebuilding complex, an agrarian complex, a gas complex, and 
many other fields. You know, I remember when they spent more 
than seven years designing the T-150 tractor in Kharkiv and in 
the end never did finish the project, even though we are told 
there was financing then, and accounts were settled, and there 
were no problems with money. The Politburo of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine held two hearings on 
this matter and the Secretariat held three, and still the 
tractor never got built. Whereas now I saw more than seven 
models of new tractors, all built in one year and all 
significantly superior to the T-150 in terms of their technical 
and economic indicators. This is an example of what people can 
do when they do not have to report to the politburo and to the 
secretariat, when no one stands over them telling them what to 
do, what paint to use, when to sow, and when to reap. But for 
there to be really major qualitative changes, you need time. I 
am convinced that despite all the difficulties, despite the 
decline in production, despite the reorganization and the 
constructive changes that will inevitably be made, the national 
economy and reforms are moving forward. Our political affairs 
are moving ahead, gradually, with difficulty, in jumps and 
starts, with reverses, accompanied by the reflections of various 
forces; the political construction of our society is under way 
-- in other words, we are moving ahead. Laboriously, taking into 
account our particular internal and external circumstances, but 
nonetheless moving forward. 
  [Bazelyuk] There is no question that the peace we have in 
our 
country is a great achievement. Both our own people and the 
world community recognize that the president of Ukraine deserves 
a great deal of credit for this. Now, however, certain political 
circles are leaning in favor of Ukraine becoming a full-fledged, 
so to speak, member of the economic union, rather than just an 
associate member, by signing all the agreements involved in this 
union. As we know, these agreements provide for joint defense of 
the so-called borders of the CIS, including those where wars are 
being fought. Is it not conceivable that the new politicians 
might imprudently sign CIS agreements that are fatal to Ukraine, 
and, just as during the Afghan war, we will once again be 
receiving coffins holding the bodies of Ukrainian youths killed 
on distant and foreign borders? 
  [Kravchuk] On the whole, it is very difficult to predict and 
be so certain about what will or will not happen in politics. 
But I can say this. Returning our society and our people to the 
past, knowing what serious consequences this may have, is out of 
the question. Although some of our present-day politicians -- if 
you can call them that in this respect -- do make such 
statements. But these statements are more in the spirit of 
populism than reflective of a belief that this can actually be 
done. For instance, I cannot understand nor take seriously a 
person in the leadership of a political movement who today gets 
up and says that it is possible to return to the Soviet Union. 
These are illusions. This will never happen again. Or, for 
example, without knowing the historical, ethnic, political, 
spiritual, and other roots of the issue, there are those who say 
that it is possible to create a so-called Slavic union. There is 
such an idea. But when you are dealing with an ignoramus, you 
can see that in describing this category as an aim, he has no 
idea who is behind this and what it implies. To begin with, 
strictly speaking, this is not a matter of a Slavic union, but 
of an East Slavic union. Secondly, any entity created on the 
national principle -- and history attests to this -- inevitably 
gives rise to nationalism in the worst sense of the word, 
because you cannot talk about nationalism or national phenomena 
using only a minus sign. Every current carries in it both good 
and bad. This is inevitably so. Thirdly, this kind of Slavic 
union cannot be realized in practice. When they speak of three 
states -- Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus (although Russia is not 
purely Slavic) -- [they need to keep in mind] that 35 million 
Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Russians today live outside the 
borders of these states. Just imagine, we create a Slavic union, 
then an Asian union, and then some other unions, and what are 
those Ukrainians, Russians, and Belarusians who find themselves 
living in an Asian union to do? Join the Slavic union? Are we 
prepared to settle the territorial issues that this would 
involve? The notion of this kind of union reveals a basic lack 
of sense. I might understand this proposal coming from an 
emotional person, a poet, for example, without any insult 
intended to anyone. But when this is being proposed by a person 
who considers himself a politician, he obviously fails to 
understand and does not know what he is saying. And if he does 
not know, he should remain silent. There is a golden rule: talk 
when you know, and if you don't, say nothing. 
  [Bazelyuk] Leonid Makarovych, as long as Ukraine remains a 
member of the CIS, we in Galicia, Volhynia, and other regions 
will feel no peace about the fate of our state. There are 
various ways of dragging Ukraine into interethnic conflicts, 
none of which, incidentally, erupted without Moscow playing a 
role, and this can ultimately result in the loss of our state. 
We are anxious to know: when will we finally leave the CIS? 
  [Kravchuk] If only all of Ukraine were Galicia or 
Volhynia... 
As you know, I have to deal with a Ukraine in which people in 
Galicia, Slobozhanshchyna, the Luhansk region, and the Crimea 
all think differently. To prevent quarrels and divisions, we 
have to ensure that we are understood everywhere, and haste is 
not always appropriate. You may recall that there was this 
notion a few years ago that Galicia could reeducate the East; 
all it would take would be a few columns of buses with slogans 
sent to the East and tomorrow we would have the same level of 
national consciousness there as in Galicia. But this did not 
happen. On the contrary, it made the situation even worse. 
  Today, the CIS poses no threat in terms of dragging us into 
something; it is generally incapable of dragging anyone into 
anything. Take my word for it. There is no mechanism for this. 
The European Union has a mechanism; it has a common parliament, 
common legislation that regulates the economic sphere, and a 
council of ministers. The CIS has nothing; there are only 
declaratory statements and signed documents that have never been 
implemented in the past and are not being implemented now, 
because to implement them would require concerted action. If we 
were to sign a document today about a common economic space and 
tomorrow about free trade, and yet Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine 
continue to pursue policies inside their own countries dictated 
by the domestic situation in each and with no regard for the 
signed documents, these documents will never come into force. I 
tell you this as someone who signed the documents: the CIS today 
serves more of a psychological than a practical purpose -- it 
assuages the fears of that portion of the population that 
thinks, and is correct in doing so, that we cannot and must not 
(I say this to you, Galicians, whom I know well) make it our 
goal to split away or turn our backs on the East. If someone 
gets the idea that something will come from Moscow tomorrow and 
we immediately turn our backs on the East, we will be doomed. 
Because we can live in peace with such a large neighbor only if 
we build an intelligent and flexible policy. We do not have the 
strength to oppose Russia. We have to preserve our gains. We 
must not lose. We have to take advantage of this opportunity. 
And this requires flexibility, partnership, independence, 
concessions, becoming strong, and then we can say... But we 
cannot do it right away, even though I might want to... You 
know, if it is possible to compare all of Galicia, with all due 
respect for it, with just my own small wish, then you can 
believe me when I tell you that in the last four years so much 
has passed through my heart and my nervous system for Ukraine 
that there was nothing more in my life than the greatest wish 
--that tomorrow Ukraine be truly strong, truly democratic, truly 
prosperous and that I could say so loudly to my people. I think 
about this constantly, but I know that I cannot do this, and so 
I have to be patient. I have to keep moving forward, without 
falling to my knees, without bending, while driving our servile 
mentality out of myself and all those around me, so as not to 
lose this opportunity. Meanwhile, they keep telling me: "Faster, 
faster!" But, [as the saying goes], if you make haste, you'll 
make people laugh. Only this will be laughter through tears. We 
do not have the right to do this. And the Galicians must 
understand this. These are not simple matters. If, God forbid, 
we lose this time, I do not know what will happen. 
  [Bazelyuk] Ukraine is a central European state and a lot is 
being done to build her relations with other countries, and not 
only with Russia. What are Ukraine's prospects in the nearest 
future for strengthening her contacts with the world community? 
  [Kravchuk] On 14 June, I am going to Brussels, where Ukraine 
will be the first of the CIS countries to sign an agreement with 
the European Union on the principles of partnership. This opens 
up before us a real partnership with European countries, with 
the European market, with European culture, with everything we 
need to have real ties with Europe. We are being accused that 
Ukraine pursues a policy of self-isolation. Well, someone says 
so in the street, and another hears it and repeats it on 
television. Such people have their problems, and that determines 
my attitude to them. We must have normal partnership relations 
in the East, and in the West, and in the North, and in the 
South, and good-neighborly relations with our neighbors. That is 
the only way to live without forever having to worry about our 
borders, about whether there is someone standing behind our 
backs and what their intentions are. Otherwise, we will have to 
focus all our efforts on defending ourselves, and we will have 
to surround ourselves with a great force. This is not 
realistically possible in our present situation. That is why we 
have chosen to develop relations in Europe, in the West, the 
East, the South, and the North. The signing of the partnership 
agreement with the European Union will be the first, very 
important step for Ukraine. 
  [Bazelyuk] Leonid Makarovych, your opponents quite often 
accuse you of backing down at times when it is necessary to 
stand up for the national interests of Ukraine. 
  [Kravchuk] Give me an example. 
  [Bazelyuk] For example, on the issue of the Black Sea fleet. 
Another issue that is very painful to us all is Crimea. You 
know, the voters will also base their decision regarding whom to 
vote for in the presidential election in large measure on each 
candidate's approach to the Crimean question. Thus when one of 
them recently announced that he will do with Crimea what the 
residents of that peninsula vote for, clearly sensible people 
will not vote for him. 
  [Kravchuk] He simply does not understand certain fundamental 
things. The question of Crimea is not something that concerns 
only the population of Crimea; this concerns Ukraine as a whole. 
Even if we were to consider the possibility of deciding Crimea's 
status by referendum, this would have to be an all-Ukrainian 
referendum. We have to remember that for forty years, I, my 
parents, and yours have worked to develop Crimea. It was Ukraine 
that did this -- I say this without exaggeration --the roads, 
the water, the resorts -- everything that was possible to do. 
Today, all of a sudden, they tell me that it is solely up to the 
population that lives in the Crimea to decide the Crimean 
question. What if this population decides it on the basis of the 
national idea, for example, or some other idea? Am I to agree to 
this? Under no circumstances. I firmly maintain the position 
that the Crimea was and will remain part of Ukraine. The 
constitutional recognition of this postulate is the starting 
point and ultimate goal of building relations with the Crimea. 
No other option is possible. If the Crimea chooses another 
course, we will respond appropriately. You see, I made 
concessions up to the point that territorial integrity became 
the issue. Then I said: "You have crossed the red line." That 
was the end. Whatever the Crimea passes, we revoke. I have 
stated officially at all levels: "Ukraine -- yes, in accordance 
with the constitutional regime -- yes. We will defend our 
integrity and inviolability, and everyone must understand this." 
Otherwise, the world will never respect us. A state, president, 
or government that does not defend territorial integrity, 
sovereignty, and inviolability of borders cannot be regarded as 
a state, a president, or a government. My sole concern is to 
avoid a clash, to avoid a confrontation. So far, we have been 
successful. I can see the situation in the Crimea changing 
before our eyes. The people have also realized that the moment 
of what might be called general romanticism has passed, that the 
limit has been reached and from now on we will work in 
accordance with the constitution. And no declarations, no 
threats that they will do something in the Crimea without us -- 
these are merely intentions, whereas the proof will be in 
actions, and I am convinced that these actions will be in favor 
of Ukraine. 
  [Bazelyuk] Moscow politicians are now promoting a new idea: 
they say, why does Ukraine not establish relations with the 
Crimea along the same lines as Russia's relations with 
Tatarstan? What firm step can be taken to put an end to the 
chauvinist bacchanal in the Crimea, where normal people are 
anxiously awaiting just such a step? 
  [Kravchuk] Let me tell you about Tatarstan. The people who 
recommend this solution have not read the agreement signed by 
Yeltsin and Sheymiyev. I have read it. It contains federal 
powers, Tatarstan's powers, and shared powers. The armed forces, 
the organs of the ministry of internal affairs, and the security 
organs are all under the jurisdiction of the federal government, 
and Tatarstan has no say in these matters. Other key spheres are 
also shared. In the Crimea, they even wanted to have their own 
army and all the power structures; they wanted Ukraine to get 
out completely. The Crimean leadership's position is that the 
peninsula is an independent state and that its connection with 
Ukraine is allegedly only a formality. The suggestion that we 
should look to Tatarstan as a model is an insidious attempt at 
deceiving people. I say, fine, let's read this agreement and you 
will see that our law on the division of powers gives just as 
many powers to the Crimean side. We can review them and add to 
them. But on one condition only: that the Crimea is an 
autonomous republic that is part of Ukraine, and we strike from 
the agenda all territorial issues, all issues pertaining to a 
review of borders, all talk of the Crimea wanting to leave 
someplace and or go someplace, to unite with someone, because 
1954 was supposedly a mistake. None of these issues should even 
be raised. 
  [Bazelyuk] Allow me to return once again to the question of 
your yieldingness with respect to the Black Sea Fleet. On 5 
April 1992, you signed a decree subordinating the Black Sea 
Fleet and the strategic armed forces to Ukraine. Subsequently, 
you put a moratorium on your own decree. Then, in the process of 
settling the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, we made significant 
concessions to Russia. Even now, when the question of where the 
Naval Forces of Ukraine are to be based is under discussion, our 
forces are being offered Balaklava, where neither our large 
surface ships, nor our large submarines will be able to enter 
the bay, and Danuzlav, where ships can only move in one 
direction. 
  [Kravchuk] Is that what members of the military say? 
  [Bazelyuk] Yes, members of the military say so. All the 
same, 
why has your decree of 5 April 1992 not been implemented in full 
-- why are the strategic forces subordinated to Ukraine and the 
Black Sea Fleet is not? 
  [Kravchuk] If you recall, the day after I issued my decree, 
Yeltsin issued a decree of his own, subordinating the Black Sea 
Fleet to Russia. And so there were two decrees -- mine and 
Yeltsin's. The situation grew tense and could have become 
explosive. If all the officers and sailors serving in the Black 
Sea Fleet thought the way I wrote in my decree, if Sevastopol 
were Lviv and the population had taken an appropriate stand, the 
situation would have been different. It was necessary to relieve 
the tension. Then Yeltsin said that he would suspend the 
relevant article of his decree if I suspended mine until the 
problem of the Black Sea Fleet was resolved. So much for the 
record. Now let us examine the practical aspects. Let us pose 
the question bluntly: will Russia leave Sevastopol today or not? 
  [Bazelyuk] She will if she is removed by force. 
  [Kravchuk] Exactly. You are correct in saying that the only 
way to achieve this is to use force. But we will not remove 
Russia from Sevastopol by force. Everyone understands this. 
Force means fighting. Neither I, nor you wants this. That means 
that the only option we have is to negotiate. Russia and her 
president have declared officially that they cannot leave 
Sevastopol at this time and that they will not do so. This 
declaration has been made. I do not like it. I believe that 
those who think in normal terms, in terms of international 
categories and international legal norms, could make a series of 
arguments to show that this statement is incompatible with 
international standards. But the situation is what it is, and 
this declaration has been made by a state that has power today. 
This state issues a declaration not regarding Kiev directly; it 
makes it with respect to Sevastopol. The Russian parliament 
declares Sevastopol to be a Russian city, and this declaration 
on the city's status has not been revoked to this day. That is 
the first point. Secondly, although he does not say so publicly, 
the Russian president, as well as other governing structures [in 
Russia], believes that Crimea, 1954, were a mistake, that this 
was Khrushchev's gift, and they consider the Crimea to be their 
territory, even though they cannot say so publicly in the broad 
nternational arena. This is why they say that they will not 
leave Sevastopol. What do I do? I say: "No, you will leave." 
What other steps are there? People say to me, let us appeal to 
international organizations, to the UN. We will declare the 
Russian troops to be foreign troops on our soil and then discuss 
this issue for years. But tell me, what world organization can 
order Russia to leave Sevastopol? Is there such an organization? 
There is not. This means that whether I like or not, my 
yieldingness on this issue is not a matter of my seeing a 
realistic solution and failing to implement it, but a matter of 
my understanding that the solution that is being proposed is 
unrealistic and impossible to carry out. 
  People tell me to use force. Were there times in history 
when 
force was used to decide certain issues? There were. But I have 
to know in advance that my force will win, and I am not 
convinced of this. I once put this question to the former 
minister of defense. We were sitting together in an airplane. 
Talking just as you and I are talking right now. And I asked 
him: "What is the current correlation of Ukrainian and Russian 
forces in the Crimea?" One to six in Russia's favor. That was 
then. With Kerch and Novorosiysk nearby. Should we create a 
Karabakh there, start a fight that will remain part of history 
forever? A war between two Slavic peoples. Two nations that 
lived together for 340 years -- with bitterness, on bad terms, 
with better and worse pages in their history, but nevertheless 
living together, and then suddenly they should embark on a war 
that will end in tragedy. Or we'll create another Yugoslavia. 
That is what all this can lead to. I take into account not only 
my own wishes, but also realistic possibilities, the correlation 
of forces, the support of the world. Even if the world supports 
us, this support will be purely declarative. Believe me, there 
will be no direct intervention, because this involves Russia. 
  [Bazelyuk] We now have a Supreme Council, in which not only 
have the Communists and Socialists taken over the top governing 
posts, but they also head most of the commissions. Moreover, 
they make declarations from the tribune about communist ideals 
and talk of the upcoming anniversary of the Great October 
Revolution. This may frighten off and turn away the world from 
Ukraine as a communist preserve. What is your view of this 
problem, Leonid Makarovych? After winning the presidential 
election, will you include only leftists in your team, or will 
you also recruit rightists, especially in light of the fact that 
deputies from the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists have now 
won seats in parliament? 
  [Kravchuk] I know one thing: as long as I live and if I am 
elected, I will never allow Ukraine to return to communist times 
and will do everything in my power to prevent this. Anything 
else means tragedy. Not only because the world may or may not 
recognize us. This is important, but this is not a tragedy. 
Ultimately, they will recognize us. The tragedy lies in the fact 
that this would mean the complete end of Ukraine. If someone in 
the Supreme Council thinks that it is possible to change 
direction and that this will benefit the people, that we can 
return to a time when everything will be cheap and everyone will 
immediately have security, this is no more than a contemptible 
and overt attempt to deceive the people. It is my duty to tell 
people this frankly in order to prevent this from happening. Why 
are they fighting so hard against President Kravchuk just now? 
Do you think there are other reasons for this? No. Only because 
I stand in their way. And not because I have a negative attitude 
to some specific member of the party. This was never the case. I 
am opposed to changing course and to any attempt to represent 
these intentions as being good for Ukraine. They are bad for 
Ukraine. People tell me that things are bad today in any event. 
I don't deny this, but we are moving ahead and we will emerge 
onto a civilized path -- we definitely will. Every nation has 
lived through this plight. But if there is an attempt to change 
course, we will not solve our problems. We will end up in an 
even worse situation, and, moreover, one that will end in 
tragedy. I know Galicia, and not only Galicia, but also the 
center, and Kiev, and Kharkiv. Do you think that the director of 
a plant wants someone to stand over him again, to summon him, 
stifle him, trample him, force him to acknowledge that he is a 
good-for-nothing if he wants to keep his job, otherwise get 
sacked? He used to stand there and give his word while they 
poured filth over him and let him keep his job. Do you think 
that he wants more of this today? Most have long since had 
enough. But there are still some left. Therefore, what the 
people feel and what happens on the surface -- party passions, 
fights, and all the rest -- are totally different. They say: the 
people gave us their support. But that's because they lied. 
Unfortunately, it is still possible to deceive our people. 
  [Bazelyuk] Does this mean that you see your main support as 
coming from society, from the people, and not from parties? 
  [Kravchuk] From the people! Absolutely not from parties, 
which are still too weak. Let us talk frankly about the 
Communist Party, which I know better than anyone else. The 
Communist Party had 3.5 million members in Ukraine. According to 
the data I have, today this party numbers 250,000-300,000 
members. Who has remained in its ranks? The best people that 
once belonged to the party have already found themselves: one 
works in the economy, another in the cultural sphere, another 
still in politics. They have gradually changed their attitudes 
and found themselves as people with an intellect, a certain 
amount of training, and a certain orientation. And those who 
have not found themselves and never will -- what do they want? 
To take power. But such people will not be able to cope with 
power. What do I have in common with these people today? 
  Take national-patriotism, for example. There is a segment 
among these eople about whom you speak with whom it is possible 
to have dealings, but there is also another segment, which knows 
only one thing -- to fight. Pressure, war. Look at them. Those 
are leftists and those are leftists. Those say -- take away, and 
those say -- divide; those say -- hang them, and those say -- 
cut their heads off. Absolutely identical slogans, identical 
aims. And I am to deal with them? To whom should I look for 
support? The times are so very difficult. The people bore a 
bouquet, and it is made up of both flowers and thistles. I do 
not want to divide them into categories at this time and offend 
them. Consequently, I said I would not ally myself with any 
group. We have a constitution. Let them live in accordance with 
the law and work -- that's democracy. But in the work of 
defending the state, of moving the state forward -- to 
democracy, to reform, the only support I can rely on today is 
that of the people. 
  [Bazelyuk] With all your concerns, do you have time to visit 
Rivne Oblast, your native region? 
  [Kravchuk] Unfortunately, I do not. Perhaps during this 
campaign. You see, I am at a disadvantage. I have to perform the 
duties of president and cannot delegate these duties to anyone. 
There is no office of vice-president, and I cannot say: "Well, 
boys and girls, you stay here, while I go out to fight for the 
presidential chair." I cannot do this. I don't have enough time 
to even think about the places where I was born [as published]. 
  [Bazelyuk] But these are the places that have probably left 
the most vivid impressions in your mind, are they not? 
  [Kravchuk] Only from my childhood. I have retained the 
memory 
of our picturesque Polissya landscapes. Sometimes, during my 
travels, I see something and think -- this looks like home, 
there is an orchard like that in our village. In these 
comparisons, one's own native region always wins out, because, 
consciously or not, one always thinks one's own is the best. 
Perhaps I will manage to get to Rivne Oblast. I would like to, 
but it's possible I won't be able to manage. But I will 
definitely come to Lviv on 12 June. 
  [Bazelyuk] We are waiting for you. Thank you for this 
interview, and I sincerely wish you victory in the presidential 
election.

Zaporizhzhya Oblast: "They Are Patching Okhrim's Overcoat"] 
  [Text] The farmers of Zaporizhzhya Oblast have completed 
sowing early grain crops and and other pulse crops on an area of 
236,000 hectares. In addition, they had to resow winter crops on 
168,000 hectares. But a great deal of work has yet to be done -- 
some 700,000 hectares of late crops still need to be sown. They 
have already begun sowing feed and sugar beets in the southern 
regions of the oblast, and the fields are being preapred for 
planting corn. 
  "Before spring began, there was a great deal of panic that 
the farms would not manage to sow their fields," said I. 
Kostenko, the chairman of the Shevchenko Collective Farm in 
Zaporizhzhya Rayon. "But these dire predictions have not come 
true -- work in the fields is continuing. We even sowed our 
early grain crops in two shifts, but the devil take such work. 
We're short of the most essential things but cannot buy them. 
Actually, the farm is doing quite well, but nonpayment by the 
state has put it on file [i.e., left it in debt], and now the 
bank takes every kopeck that is deposited in our account towards 
paying off our debts. We recently received 60 million 
karbovantsi for buying spare parts, but all we heard was the 
rustle of this money disappearing at the bank. The state should 
probably give some thought to arranging for this money to go 
directly to suppliers rather than into the collective farm's 
account." 
  That is not the only thing that the state needs to think 
about. It has introduced a so-called commodities credit on goods 
to be produced in 1994 and applies this credit to supply the 
farms with fuel, fertilizer, and herbicides. This has helped the 
farmers in the busy spring season. But while it provides 
gasoline and diesel fuel, the state has completely forgotten to 
include lubricants. 
  "You can howl in despair, for all the good it will do you," 
complains A. Klymenko, the chairman of the Druzhba Collective 
Farm in Tokmak Rayon. "Right now, we don't have a problem with 
fuel, but we can't take our equipment into the fields without 
lubricants. Dealers are asking 30 million karbovantsi per metric 
ton. And where are we to get the money when the processing 
enterprises owe us one billion karbovantsi? A lack of funds is 
preventing us from buying suger beet seed, and we did not stock 
up on top quality spring grain seed. We are still waiting for 
the mineral fertilizer promised us by contract." 
  Here, as at many other farms, spare parts are a problem. 
According to A. Klymenko, the rayahropostach [rayon agricultural 
supply center ?] has spare parts, but it requires advance 
payment because it has received no directive from above to issue 
spare parts on credit. 
  The farmers are doing whatever they can to solve their 
problems. They are siphoning off lubricants from combine 
engines. They remove working parts and assemblies from tractors 
that are not needed in the fields at a given moment. In short, 
they are patching Okhrim's overcoat. But how much longer can it 
last?

Oblast: "An Urgent Signal: Stop the Seed Drills!"] 
  [Text] V. Matviyenko, head of the Sarny Administration of 
Agriculture and Food returned to the rayon center in a bad mood: 
  "There is little good news. I visited Tynne, Hnymovychi, and 
Stepan. You cannot approach the machine operators. They sowed a 
few hectares of corn each and stopped their machines: there is 
no more seed. 
  A shortage of seed is holding up sowing in most of the 
oblast's collective agricultural enterprises. The seed, which 
the farms obtained on their own by bartering it for sugar, 
timber, meat, and other products, has all been sown, and the 
promised new supplies have still not arrived. In accordance with 
a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers, the oblast was to have 
received 2,012 metric tons of corn seed before the sowing season 
began. 
  The farmers are trying to make arrangements with seed 
suppliers in Vinnytsya, Kherson, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts. 
These, however, are refusing to be persuaded and are demanding 
payment in advance. But the grain procurement enterprises have 
no money, and the loans have gotten lost at the banks.

Association, chief of the administration of the state plant 
protection service, and M. Lisovyy, director of the Ukrainian 
Institute of Plant Protection of the Ukrainian Academy of 
Agricultural Sciences [UAAN], academician: "We Will Protect Our 
Grain"] 
  [Text] Severe frosts and autumn sowing shortfalls 
significantly narrowed the winter grain crops wedge [on the pie 
chart]. Now another problem has been added: the crops are being 
threatened by pests, disease, and weeds. Grain crops are in 
danger of being harmed by the gout fly, oat leaf beetle, cereal 
flea beetle, and other pests. But the greatest threat in the 
southern, forest-steppe, and steppe regions comes from the sunn 
pest. Despite severe winter frosts, its numbers remain very 
high, especially in Zaporizhzhya, Kherson, and Mykolayiv 
oblasts, and a number of rayons of Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, and 
Kirovohrad oblasts. The diseases posing a danger include 
septoria, powdery mildew, and root rot, which have appeared on 
winter wheat in a number of rayons in Zhytomyr, Donetsk, 
Chernivtsi, and other oblasts. As to weeds -- it goes without 
saying that with no herbicides and fuel to speak of, they have 
moved in widely in recent years. 
  What should be done? If there is dense weed growth in the 
tillering phase, sown areas are sprayed with 40-percent amino 
salt 2,4-D (1.5-2.5 liters per hectare), 70-percent sodium salt 
2m-4X (1.5-2 liters per hectare), and 40-percent dialen (1.9-2.3 
liters per hectare). To control the sunn pest (when numbering 
two, three, or more per square meter) and other pests during the 
mass infestation of winter wheat (in the booting phase), spring 
wheat and barley (tillering phase), it is necessary to spray the 
sown areas or around them in a 100-meter-wide strip with 
40-percent metaphoson (0.5-0.7 liter per hectare), or 40-percent 
phosphamidon (1-1.5 liters per hectare), or 2.5-percent decis 
(0.25 liter per hectare). On spring crops, if the tilling dates 
coincide, mixtures of these insecticides and herbicides may be 
used in the recommended doses. 
  If more than one percent of the plants are affected by 
powdery mildew, or more than five percent by septoria in 
conditions of high humidity, high temperatures, and frequent 
rains, the plants should be sprayed with 25-percent [bayleton] 
(0.5 liters per hectare), 25-percent [tylt] (0.5 liters per 
hectare), and 40-percent [alto] (0.15-0.2 liters per hectare). 
Controlling pests and diseases should be combined by using 
mixtures of insecticides and fungicides in the recommended doses.

<F P=106> [Interview with M. Rubets, head of the Plant Protection </F>
Administration of the Ukrahrokhim Association, by V. Onenko; 
place and date not given: "The Fields Are Sensing a Premonition 
of Trouble. M. Rubets, Head of the Plant Protection 
Administration of the Ukrahrokhim Association Responds to 
Questions from the SILSKI VISTI Correspondent"] 
  [Text] 
  [Onenko] Mykola Maksymovych, spring field work is in full 
swing. What is the phitosanitary situation in the fields? 
  [Rubets] Poor. According to our signalling and forecast 
service, not many ests died out during the winter. The situation 
is greatly complicated by a shortage of fuel and lubricants. 
Because these are scarce, many farms have begun to "simplify" 
farming techniques. In short, there will be many more weeds, 
pests, and pathogenes in the fields than in earlier years. 
  [Onenko] Are there enough pesticides to combat these pests? 
  [Rubets] No. There is a shortage of herbicides for applying 
to the soil when sowing corn, and many farms have planted sugar 
beets without applying herbicides. We do not have enough 
fungicides and insecticides to control plant diseases and pests. 
  [Onenko] Did the Ukrahrokhim services fail to do their job? 
  [Rubets] Judge for yourself. Last year, our specialists 
worked out plans that provided for the production this year of 
50,000 metric tons of domestic plant protectants, which would 
have allowed us to meet 60 percent of the demand for these 
products in agricultural production. There were plans to put 
manufacturing lines into operation at Ukrainian chemical 
enterprises, where the necessary pesticides could have been made 
from imported active agents. But very little has been done. The 
Radykal Plant in Kiev started production of copper oxychloride 
and [utal]. The Pervomaysk Khimprom Production Association 
(Kharkiv Oblast), which specializes in manufacturing fungicides, 
is now setting up the production of insecticides and herbicides. 
However, this is a mere drop in the ocean; the country's 
chemical enterprises are meeting only 20 percent of the demand 
for pesticides. We do not expect any improvements in the 
situation anytime soon, because most of the projects developed 
by our specialists have been shelved due to the meagerness of 
the budget allocations for the purchase of the necessary active 
agents abroad. 
  [Onenko] Are we then compelled to use the services of 
foreign 
companies once again? 
  [Rubets] We can expect very little from them, although I do 
not mean to reproach our foreign partners. Companies in the 
United States, England, Switzerland, Germany, and other 
countries have plenty of pesticides and are prepared to sell 
them. The problem lies elsewhere: the state treasury is empty; 
there is no hard currency for centralized purchasing of the 
essential plant protectants. The scraps of hard currency that we 
receive from time to time from the tender committee of the 
Cabinet of Ministers are simply not enough. To buy only the 
minimum amount of the plant protectants we need this year, we 
need at least 120 million dollars, and 50 million of this sum 
before 1 May. Ukrahrokhim has been issued only 15 million 
dollars. You cannot buy very much for this sum. 
  [Onenko] Perhaps the government should make the decision to 
sell some resources abroad and use the revenues from this sale 
to purchase the necessary pesticides? A similar measure last 
year helped to alleviate the situation somewhat. 
  [Rubets] Yes. But the situation has now changed, and not in 
our favor. The price of our metallurgical and chemical products, 
which we once sold at a profit on the world market, has now 
fallen below its production cost. Who is going to trade at a 
loss? 
  [Onenko] And what about the credit lines promised Ukraine by 
the United States for buying products needed in agricultural 
production? 
  [Rubets] Last year, they helped us a great deal. On the 
credit lines that had been opened, American firms supplied 
Ukraine with 94 million dollars' worth of protectants. If this 
were the case today, we would have far fewer problems with our 
supplies of pesticides. In addition, the country owes these 
companies large sums of money. As a result, our foreign partners 
are in no hurry to meet us halfway. 
  [Onenko] What debts are you talking about? 
  [Rubets] Ukrahrokhim had nothing to do with them. This is 
money owed by Ukrahrobiznes for pesticides delivered to Ukraine 
the year before last. The foreign firms are quite justified in 
setting the government of our country, which vouched for 
Ukrahrobiznes at the time, the following condition: first pay 
your bills, and then we can talk about concluding agreements 
regarding our selling you new batches of compounds. 
Unfortunately, this matter has still not been settled. 
  [Onenko] The situation is critical. Yet, for some reason, 
existing reserves are not being used. One such reserve would be 
to inspect and use the plant protectants that have been lying in 
storage from past years. Why are these not being used? 
  [Rubets] Your suggestion is quite proper. We have already 
inventoried and recorded these pesticides. We submitted 
proposals to the State Interdepartmental Commission for Testing 
and Registering Plant Protectants and Growth Regulators and 
Fertilizers, which agreed to extend the deadline for the use of 
these substances. The commission's decision was supported by the 
opinions of more than thirty experts, all respected cientists. 
But the Ministry of Public Health has taken a rather odd stand 
on this matter. It has refused permission for their use and has 
handed over the pesticides to an interdepartmental committee of 
experts at the Institute of Labor. I should add that the 
pesticides had already been subjected to expert analysis by the 
same Public Health Ministry's Institute of Hygiene and 
Toxicology. Is it possible that the ministry's top officials do 
not trust their own scientific institution, which has a great 
eal of experience in this field? While the papers are passed 
back and forth between offices, the deadline for using these 
vitally needed pesticides will pass.

<F P=106> [Article by Yu. Serebryannykov, head of the subcommittee of </F>
the fuel-energy complex of the commission for questions on the 
development of basic sectors of the national economy of the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council: "Energy Conservation: What Needs To 
Be Done in Order To Move From Talk to Action"] 
  [Text] The question of energy conservation generates 
an extremely difficult situation, which continues to worsen, 
with respect to supplying the Ukrainian national economy with 
fuel-energy resources. The shutdown of enterprises and the 
reduction in the work week do not solve the problem, but only 
make it more complex. In addition, this leads to social tension 
in the labor unions of the enterprises, as confirmed by the 
multitude of their appeals to the Ukrainian Supreme Council. The 
last of such appeals was an open letter from the collective of 
the Institute of Energy Conservation of the Ukrainian Academy of 
Sciences [AN]. 
  As the leading experts concerning questions of energy 
conservation, they emphasize in the appeal the absence of a 
guaranteed system for introducing economics in the use of energy 
and resources and responsibility for their inefficient use. 
  Over the last 10 years, the Ukrainian economy was based on 
ineffectual waste of energy, which lead to an energy and 
economic crisis. The energy capacity of the gross domestic 
product is several times greater than in the developed countries 
of Western Europe. Prices for energy resources, which Ukraine 
imports, in fact, are approaching world levels, and this 
increase in practice has not influenced the use of fuel and 
energy. 
  Enterprises almost automatically include the increase in 
price of energy inputs in the production cost of the finished 
product, totally ignoring the question of conserving energy 
resources. 
  According to the Ministry of Energy, industry in Ukraine 
every year inefficiently wasted almost 3 billion kilowatt-hours 
of electric power and 6 million gigacalories of thermal energy. 
The energy usage per unit of national income during 1991-1993 
increased by 25 percent, while electric usage increased by 41.1 
percent, at a time when the volume of production during 
1992-1993 decreased by 20.6 percent. 
  According to the experts at the Institute of Energy 
Conservation, which is supported by the Commission of the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council for the problems of the development of 
the basic sectors of the national economy, one of the 
fundamental means for overcoming the energy crisis in Ukraine 
should be an active government energy conservation policy. 
  Why should it be governmental? 
  For all the nations of the world, even for those that have 
their own energy resources, the power industry is one of the 
primary factors in protecting the functioning of the economy and 
the social sphere. This is a guarantee of the strength of a 
government, and its independence from unfriendly external 
factors. That is why the administration of the power industry 
and the drafting of an energy strategy and policy are matters 
for the government. But, this does not simultaneously mean that 
the power industry should function as a government sector of the 
economy. It should be privatized, as in most of the developed 
nations of the world. World experience shows that the 
government's influence on this sector is secured through the 
path of development of strategy and policy for the development 
of energy, reinforced by corresponding legislative acts and, 
most important, with economic methods of regulation. 
  Today, there are two principal directions for providing the 
energy requirement of the country: growth of the energy capacity 
for generation of energy, as was done earlier, during the 
existence of the USSR; and a significant increase in the 
efficient use of energy in all sectors of the economy, in other 
words, energy conservation. 
  The first direction is absolutely hopeless and even 
desperate 
from an economic and ecological point of view. Under the 
conditions of a shortage of its own energy resources and the 
necessity of importing oil, gas, and coal at world prices, and 
in the extremely difficult ecological situation in Ukraine, 
energy conservation--this is the one possible and acceptable 
path to resolving the energy crisis. 
  The experience of the developed countries of the world--of 
Japan, France, Germany, and others--which today consume markedly 
less energy per person than Ukraine and have a several times 
larger gross national product, supports the correctness of such 
an approach. 
  As has already been noted, the potential for energy 
conservation in our country is enormous. Taking into account 
world experience, it can be asserted that not less than 65 
percent of energy resources can be conserved (taking into 
account the state of the economy). One-third of the savings can 
come from no cost-based and low cost-based measures, which 
should be carried out by a strict deadline. The remaining 
measures need significant capital investment. Along with this, 
it is essential to take into account that the financial 
investments in energy conservation are 3- to 5 times more 
effective than investments in the growth of generating power. 
  What is deterring the process of energy conservation in our 
country? 
  First of all, the absence of a legislative base on this 
issue, which would untie these knots that have become tangled 
over the course of many decades, Second, and this is most 
important, the absence of equipment and instruments to measure 
energy use (thermal, electric, gas, etc.). Third, a dedicated, 
long-established organizational, technical, and technological 
effort in all spheres to increase the efficient use of fuel and 
energy. In practice, this means that energy conservation policy 
should have a legal status and should be proclaimed as Ukrainian 
government policy. 
  The most "active" deputies are spreading the idea that the 
market will set the price of energy use, and that this will 
influence energy conservation. 
  First, today we do not yet have a civilized and balanced 
market, and significant time will be required for its creation. 
  Second, the experience of other countries shows that market 
prices by themselves do not regulate the use of energy. All of 
its outlays go into the production cost of goods, which steadily 
increases. 
  This once again testifies that there should be government 
regulation of energy use--that is, a joint use of market 
mechanisms, methods, prices, and measures of an administrative 
influence, at least during the transitional phase to a market 
economy. Market methods by themselves are insufficient, they are 
unable to fundamentally change the situation. The government 
should establish the appropriate economic agreements, influence 
the activities of the enterprises in the sphere of energy, which 
would make it possible to raise the efficiency of their efforts 
and to reduce society's need for fuel. Society should not pay 
for the carelessness and the poor management of a few producers. 
  Such a long-term government policy of energy conservation 
would without fail influence the state of affairs and would 
ensure: 
  --a steady introduction of energy conservation and a 
reduction in the price of goods; 
  --an increase in the competitiveness of production on the 
world market and broad possibilities for trade in this; 
  --a sharp decrease in the outlay of money to pay for the 
import of energy and fuel for all spheres of commerce, 
enterprises, and the populace; 
  --an improvement in the state of affairs in the social 
sphere 
thanks to a reduction in need for energy and prices, thanks to 
the production of highly efficient, domestic equipment 
(refrigerators, washing machines, televisions, etc.); 
  --an incentive for the use of independent, untraditional 
sources of energy--particularly in everyday life--of small-power 
industry, energy-conserving electric lighting, and other 
measures of energy conservation; 
  --the reduction of the technological load on nature, the 
improvement of the ecological condition in the country, and the 
increase of the life expectancy of the people. Already, the 
reduction in the use of fuel in the energy complex will provide 
a sharp reduction in the pollution of the environment. 
  Considering the importance of the energy conservation 
question for Ukraine, its influence on the life of the 
population and the improvement of its welfare, and taking in to 
account the situation that is establishing itself in connection 
with the Ukrainian Supreme Council elections, because of which 
legislative solutions to energy conservation problems are put 
off to a later time, we feel that the Ukrainian president could 
undertake the matter and issue an edict in which energy 
conservation will be recognized as a government policy and, with 
its realization, organizational measures will be stipulated.

<F P=106> [Article by Artem Filipenko under the rubric "Bosporus": </F>
"The Symplegades Could Close, Catching the Tail of the Ukrainian 
Fleet"] 
  [Text] Odessa--The ancient Greek story about the journey of 
argonauts to the far-away Colchis has preserved for us the 
legend of the Symplegades--rocks that opened and closed moment 
after moment barring ships' access to the Black Sea. The 
argonauts were lucky to pass between the rocks, losing only a 
small part of the stern. The Symplegades froze and have never 
stirred since, symbolizing free passage to the Black Sea. 
However, it appears that the rocks could close again soon, and 
forces of nature will not be to blame for this. 
  From 1936 to this date, the regimen of navigation in the 
Turkish straits of Bosporus and Dardanelles has been regulated 
by a convention signed in the city of Montreux by England, 
France, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Japan, Italy, and the USSR. 
The document envisioned the free passage of vessels of all 
states through the straits and procedures for the passage of 
military ships of the Black Sea and non-Black Sea countries 
through them. 
  However, Turkey has apparently decided that the Montreux 
convention is obsolete. In recent years, the number of vessels 
passing through the straits has increased sharply (to 45,000 a 
year), as has the size and tonnage of the ships. More than 60 
percent of the vessels carry oil, natural gas, toxic chemicals, 
and waste from nuclear power stations. The new rules developed 
in Ankara, whose introduction is scheduled for 1 June, apply 
primarily to these categories of carriage. 
  In keeping with Point 2.4, the owner or charterer of a large 
vessel must warn the Turkish administration in advance of his 
intention to use the straits and of the freight on board. If oil 
or nuclear or chemical waste appear in this entry, or if the 
vessel is nuclear-powered, the captain must file a report with 
the Turkish doorkeeper no later than 24 hours before arrival. If 
the gods, border services, and meteorological and oceanic 
conditions favor you, you sail on. Captains who operate 
potentially dangerous ships must have a local pilot on board. 
The movement of these vessels is only allowed during daytime and 
with the use of a tug. Article 3.6 envisions that the Straits of 
Bosporus and Dardanelles may be closed to maritime traffic 
during the passage of vessels with large draft, nuclear-powered 
vessels, and vessels carrying nuclear and toxic waste. Turkey 
also reserves the right to close the corridor under poor 
meteorological conditions. 
  One does not have to be an old salt to guess that the new 
restrictions will bring about delays of ships and, accordingly, 
considerable losses. However, the main point is that the 
principle of maritime traffic in the straits will be changed. 
The Turks are switching from a notification system to an 
authorization system, and authorization might be denied. The 
ecological threat, which mounts with every passing year, is the 
reason for new restrictions. Turkish experts believe that 
tankers are huge Molotov cocktails which bob on the waves in the 
middle of Istanbul with its 10 million population. 
  Murat Uzun, aide to the Turkish secretary for maritime 
affairs, stated to journalists that the new rules have just one 
purpose--to guarantee the safety of ships in the Bosporus and 
the Dardanelles, and that no revision of the convention itself 
is envisioned. That is to say, de facto Turkey has no right to 
regiment the passage of nonmilitary vessels through the straits. 
Nonetheless, recently the Turkish Government has continuously 
and unilaterally tightened the navigation regimen, having 
approved more than 20 rules restricting connections between the 
Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. 
  The restrictions introduced on tankers affect first of all 
the interests of two Black Sea states--Russia and Ukraine. It is 
possible that the former will suffer as a leading exporter of 
oil, and the recently completed oil terminal can remain a 
reminder of the former oil might of Russia. As far as Ukraine is 
concerned, after the introduction of the new rules it will have 
to forget about importing oil from the Near East. Restrictions 
apply to tankers with a displacement of more than 80,000 tonnes. 
This is the main type of Ukrainian oil carriers. To the mind of 
Yevhen Naumenko, commercial director of the Blasko-Tanker 
department, transportation of Iranian oil by small tankers will 
call for additional expenditures. 
  Let us recall that the concept of importing oil from the 
Near 
East has come up as a result of strains in the delivery of 
Russian energy resources. The developed program envisioned 
building a string of oil terminals along the Black Sea coast, 
first at the southern port in the vicinity of Odessa, where it 
was planned to build an oil offloading complex with an annual 
capacity of 40 million tonnes of oil. The program for building 
the tanker fleet of Ukraine was geared to this project. Despite 
the dubious aspects of both programs, some politicians were 
disposed to equate the terminal with Ukraine's independence. 
Warnings about the possible closure of the Turkish straits were 
perceived as a joke. However, there is a grain of truth in each 
joke. 
  Mr. Naumenko, commercial director of Blasko-Tanker, believes 
that it is too early to abandon the construction project, 
although recently the Black Sea Shipping Line has not added a 
single new oil tanker. There are several ways out of this 
situation, including the purchase of BV tankers, i.e. tankers 
that have already been used to transport oil. The 64th session 
of the Maritime Safety Committee of the International Maritime 
Organization has just ended in London. A group of Russian and 
Ukrainian maritime specialists took part in it. 
  P.S. When this article was ready for printing, a POST-POSTUP 
correspondent was notified at the department of maritime and 
river transportation that, according to the latest unofficial 
information, the Maritime Safety Committee has resolved the 
issue of the regimen of passage through the Bosporus and the 
Dardanelles in favor of Ukraine and Russia. A highly placed 
Ukrainian Government official for maritime affairs said: "Had 
Turkey achieved its objective, it would have been managing our 
merchant marine." In the opinion of this functionary of the 
department of maritime and river transportation of Ukraine, the 
Turks attempted to gain an economic advantage from their 
geographic position. They were also urged to take such actions 
by certain international cartels which would like to weaken the 
role of Russia and Ukraine in the world market. The Ukrainian 
delegation that worked in London will return early next week. It 
appears that this time the Symplegades did not move. However, 
there is no guarantee that a similar situation will not recur in 
the future. Perhaps this case will prompt the Ukrainian 
leadership to look for new sources of energy resources.

<F P=106> [Article by Marat Salimov: "Government Protects Food </F>
Producers: Schedule of Customs Duties in Ukraine"] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian government has decided to 
protect its national food producers from competition stemming 
from imported products. In accordance with a decision 
promulgated yesterday, import duties are being raised by several 
orders of magnitude on virtually all basic food products, 
including alcoholic beverages. The reasoning behind this action 
by the Ukrainian government turned out to be analogous to that 
taken by the Russian government. But whereas in Russia the 
introduction of the increased import duties was postponed until 
1 July, in Ukraine they have already gone into effect. 
  No matter how strange it may seem, the decision to introduce 
prohibitive import duties on food products was adopted at 
precisely the same time that the Ukrainian government officially 
announced that the decline of agricultural product output was 
continuing in this republic. (It is curiously interesting that 
two years ago, when the decline of production volumes in the 
agrarian sector was not so clearly expressed, decisions were 
taken on restricting the export of food products in order to 
protect the national consumer). Nevertheless, in accordance with 
the government's decision, the import duties on liquor-and-vodka 
items--as well as on drinking alcohol--rose from 50 to 350 
percent of the contractual value, on chocolate--from 10 to 100 
percent, on boiled sausage--from 20 to 100 percent, on meat and 
meat products--from 10 to 50 percent, and on sunflower-seed 
oil--from 20 to 60 percent. 
  It is very evident that in the case at hand the government 
is 
pursuing purely fiscal goals--those connected with the critical 
condition of the Ukrainian budget. However, as some independent 
Ukrainian economists have conjectured, this measure will not 
exert any tangible influence on budgetary revenues. This is 
connected with the fact that the production cost of Ukrainian 
agricultural output is significantly lower than the analogous 
Russian output, as well as that being imported from beyond the 
borders of the CIS. And so one can hardly count on the fact that 
import volumes--and, correspondingly, the revenues collected 
from levying customs duties--will increase. Furthermore, in the 
CIS countries methods have been approved for quite some time now 
for avoiding the payment of customs duties so that traditional 
importers do not turn out to be losers as a result. 
  The adoption of the present government decision, 
undoubtedly, 
would not have taken place without powerful pressure being 
exerted by the national producers of agricultural output (as 
likewise occurred in Russia at the time when the new import 
duties were approved). Ukrainian agrarians view the rise in 
import duties, on the one hand, as a possibility for increasing 
the sales of their products in the domestic market and--on the 
other hand (with the increase in prices on imported goods) as a 
possibility for sharply increasing the prices on food items 
being produced at Ukraine's enterprises. In any case, as a 
result of the increased duties, there will be a further upsurge 
of inflation--something which is already making the transition 
to hyperinflation. However, this governmental step could also 
have a positive effect--an improvement in the supply of 
Ukraine's major industrial centers with their own, domestically 
produced food items, as well as an increase in their export 
beyond the borders of the republic--first and foremost, to 
Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with V.V. Reguretskyy, first deputy chief of the </F>
tax inspectorate; place and date not given: "What Sort of Taxes 
Can We Expect?"] 
  [Text] New draft taxation documents were prepared for 
study by the Ukrainian Supreme Council. The press service of the 
Ukrainian Main State Inspectorate requested V. V. Reguretsyy, 
first deputy chief of the tax inspectorate, to comment on their 
contents. 
  [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, what innovations in 
the 
indicated documents would you single out for special attention? 
  [Reguretskyy] First of all, it is planned to introduce as a 
major change in the tax policy the transfer from taxation of 
income to taxation of profit. Such a scheme exists in 
practically all the countries. For us, however, that will permit 
the resolution of many questions. Primarily because the wage 
fund is incorporated in income and, as commonly known, is formed 
differently in various enterprises. There are highly 
labor-intensive branches of the economy where the wages are 
high, and there are also those that are less labor intensive. As 
a result, some pay 12-15 percent with relation to profit, while 
others pay in excess of 40 percent. This is specifically the 
circumstance that brought about a change in the existing system 
of collecting taxes from enterprises. 
  [PRAVDA UKRAINY] The proposal to change the nature of taxes 
is understandable. But how about lightening the tax burden? 
  [Reguretskyy] The Supreme Council will create that plank. 
The 
draft documents, however, propose a tax rate at the 30 percent 
level. And, I will note that this is significantly lower than in 
the developed states. But, we understand that today it is 
exceptionally important to operate levers that will stimulate 
the national economy, animate investments, and allow the 
development of newly created businesses. 
  [PRAVDA UKRAINY] What else is being proposed to the 
legislators? 
  [Reguretskyy] Two other no less important draft laws were 
proposed. They pertain to the taxation of enterprise property 
and real property of citizens. In our view, the entire taxation 
system must be based on two positions--tax on profit and tax on 
property. 
  Property taxes exist in all the states of the former USSR. 
We 
brought out proposals to introduce them in Ukraine in the past, 
but the previous Supreme Council did not undertake a study of 
those draft laws. Presently we attempted to arrange matters so 
that these two forms of taxes on profit and on property combined 
would not amount to more than 35 percent for the enterprises. 
  As far as subjects of taxation are concerned, for 
enterprises 
that would be property and commodity stocks. For citizens, real 
property is assumed to be apartments, houses, and structures in 
their possession. By the way, the most complex problem will be 
the correct evaluation of the real property of citizens. In 
other words, its evaluation proceeding from the existing price 
level. 
  This will require a certain amount of time. Therefore, it is 
assumed that it will be possible to introduce these taxes 
starting next year. 
  [PRAVDA UKRAINY] In discussions with enterprises, 
practically 
every other word used is value-added tax or excise duty. They 
are especially concerned with the payment of those taxes. 
  [Reguretskyy] Some changes are proposed there as well. As 
far 
as the value-added tax is concerned, it is our goal, first of 
all, to simplify the mechanism for calculating it and, secondly, 
to determine the amount of that tax more precisely. It is 
undoubtedly too high. Therefore, it is proposed to lower its 
rate. 
  [PRAVDA UKRAINY] If it's not a secret, to what level? 
  [Reguretskyy] Since the specific share of budgetary revenues 
from this source is rather high, we are conducting these 
calculations very scrupulously. We have so far tentatively 
decided on 20 percent. 
  Approaches to the determination of excise duty rates are 
also 
being reevaluated. Here, by contrast with value-added tax, the 
calculation system is simple. The most important issue is to 
determine the goods that are to be subject to excise duty. As 
before, we consider that they must be monopolistically produced 
goods, or, as we have earlier become accustomed to saying, 
nonessential goods. It is another matter what to include in that 
list. 
  I can say that for individual types of goods (for instance, 
liquors and vodka, wine, cigarettes, motor vehicles, and others) 
we are proposing to lower the rate of excise duty while 
completely exempting certain individual goods such as, for 
instance, television sets, video cassette recorders of domestic 
production, essences, alcohol (in individual cases), and some 
others. 
  All the proposals that I mentioned above are designed for 
the 
immediate future. There are some problems, however, which, in 
our opinion, must be resolved as soon as tomorrow. They include, 
let us say, questions pertaining to maintenance of the social 
sphere by enterprises. It must be preserved and supported. 
Therefore, we are proposing that all expenditures on its 
maintenance be exempted from taxes. 
  In order to animate investments, it is proposed to introduce 
additional tax benefits in individual cases. In our opinion, for 
instance, it is possible to eliminate value-added tax on all 
construction and repair work--in both production and 
nonproduction spheres. 
  [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Are there proposals to change anything in 
taxes on citizens and their personal income? 
  [Reguretskyy] With regard to the income of citizens, there 
are proposals to lower maximum rates to an acceptable level, 
while raising the level of maximum income that must be taxed at 
a higher rate. 
  [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Could you please spell that out? 
  [Reguretskyy] I think that in the final documents there 
should be no rates of 60 and 90 percent. Here it is necessary to 
proceed from the average wage level. Estimate its variations up 
and down and determine tax rates so that the bulk of the 
population would be paying acceptable personal income taxes. 
  With regard to the higher brackets, we must orient ourselves 
so as to stimulate investments instead of consumption with the 
aid of tax rates covering higher personal income. If businessmen 
earn sufficiently high income, let them simply invest it in 
production and earn profits while the tax on their income will 
then be lower. This principle of controlling that process is 
utilized by all countries. We probably should also use that 
method.

<F P=106> [Article by Zenon Starchenko, Kiev: "Never Before Has Kiev </F>
Seen Such a Friendly Turkish Invasion"] 
  [Text]One could hardly pick a worse time than the 
present for a visit by a large foreign delegation to Ukraine. 
But Turkish invasions were always timed to coincide with our 
instability, whether in the government, economy, or when our 
territorial integrity was at risk. This time, however, the 
avalanche from across the sea came not to finish us off but to 
support us. Obviously, in their own interest. 
  According to UNIAN (Ukrainian Information Agency), 
agreements 
signed during the visit covered cooperation in international 
cartage and tourism, while soon to be signed accords will 
encompass mutual investments, aviation, and oil deliveries. The 
Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has indicated that Turkey 
has plans to enter the Ukrainian market on a larger scale, 
particularly in the area of foodstuffs, textiles, clothing, 
cellulose and paper products, and leather goods. In turn, Turkey 
is interested in acquiring Ukrainian metallurgical products, as 
well as airplanes, railways cars, ships, and buses. 
  However, statistics show that Ukrainian-Turkish 
rapprochement 
needs to overcome some economic realities. Turkey had been the 
biggest consumer of Ukrainian products in the Black Sea-Middle 
East region at the time of Ukrainian declaration of 
independence, but the volume of goods purchased from Ukraine 
fell from US$323 million in 1992 to US$185 million in 1993. 
Concomitantly, Turkish exports to Ukraine fell to US$18.5 
million in 1993, while Iranian exports came to US$490 million. 
Finally, Ukrainian corporations find it advantageous to register 
in Greek-held part of Cyprus or in Lebanon where the tax climate 
is more favorable than in Turkey. 
  The brightest spot in Ukrainian-Turkish relationship 
pertains 
to the Black Sea Economic Community (BSEC) initiative, although 
the Russian and Greek delegations are attempting to create 
roadblocks. Nevertheless, as soon as the new parliament replaces 
Ivan Plyushch as the speaker, which seems certain, then a 
pro-Russian head of the Ukrainian delegation may be appointed to 
the BSEC Interparliamentary Assembly and even this bright spot 
may dim perceptibly. 
  Crimea is an area of shared concerns between Ukraine and 
Turkey. Kravchuk has already received assurances of support for 
forceful action from Europe if necessary. At least that was the 
impression gained from the visit of the British Defense Minister 
Douglas Herd [sic], and the outcome of the Paris conference on 
peace in Europe held a week ago. President Demirel's and prime 
minister Chiler's concerns for the Tartars are driven by the 
fact that if they fail to act militant muslims, whose power has 
been growing in Turkey, may take the initiative. 
  The Turkish president insisted on maximum concessions from 
Kravchuk for the Ukrainian followers of Allah. Demirel spoke for 
30 minutes with Mustafa Jemilev, the speaker of the Crimean 
Tartar Mejlis. The Tartar leader secured verbal assurances from 
the Turkish leader and the latter from the Ukrainian president. 
Turkey has proposed a tried-and-true educational approach that 
has worked in Central Asia and Azerbaijan. This includes 
creation in Crimea a network of schools with English and Turkish 
as the languages of instruction--not just for Tartars but for 
everyone--and increasing the number of Tartars studying at 
Turkish colleges and universities from 30 to 300. Access to 
Turkey for Tartars will also be eased. In addition, Demirel 
promised to assume part of the costs of Tartar relocation to 
Crimea. Naturally, Turkey is interested in using Crimea as a 
loyal outpost in Eastern Europe. For Kiev, this is an attractive 
alternative to a Russian enclave. Unlike Russia, Turkey has no 
pretensions on the Ukrainian fleet and has no insane ideas to 
make Crimea one of its own provinces. 
  Both presidents agreed that every attempt should be made to 
avoid forceful actions in Crimea, whether in the form of an 
energy embargo, a demand for three billion dollar debt 
settlement as proposed by Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, or the use of air 
power. Nevertheless, Demirel clearly indicated Turkey's 
readiness to become an ally in protecting Ukrainian national 
interests. On the other hand, the Turkish president understands 
that Ukraine has no choice but to accept Turkish support on 
Turkish conditions. This applies particularly to the Tartar 
question and Turkish exports. 
  Other ramifications are that Ukraine may become involved in 
Turkish problems. Turkey has been hit hard by the sanctions 
against Iraq since Turkey is the primary re-exported of Iraqi 
oil. These sanction were extended by Security Council in the 
April-May session. The recent Turkish proposal for a pipeline 
from Turkey through Ukraine into Europe has to seen in the Iraqi 
context. 
  Then there is the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. Turkey 
values Ukraine's opposition to various "peacekeeping forces" in 
the CIS and to growing Russian influence in the Transcaucasus. 
Finally, there is need for a joint position on the conflict in 
Yugoslavia, again involving sanctions. Ukraine wants Danube to 
be opened up fully to navigation and Ankara favors strict 
isolation of Serbia. Demirel feels that if he agrees to joint 
control of Crimea with Kravchuk, common interests will force 
Ukraine to dance to the Turkish tune.

<F P=106> ["Speech of Levon Ter-Petrosyan, President of the Republic </F>
of Armenia, at a Special Session of the Supreme Council of the 
Republic of Armenia on 13 June 1994"] 
  [Text] Greatly Esteemed Chairman, 
  Greatly Esteemed Deputies! 
  I have the honor to present for your attention the basic 
provisions of the draft constitution drawn up by the 
Constitutional Commission of the Supreme Council of the 
republic, putting the emphasis merely on the most important 
principles and methodological tasks. 
  From the methodological viewpoint, the draft of the 
Constitutional Commission is based on the following main 
principles: regarding the Constitution as a purely legal 
document designed to ensure the lasting stability and effective 
activity of the state, to renounce situational opportunist 
solutions, avoid political compromises, and be guided solely by 
legal considerations, taking as a basis international experience 
and the legislative tradition of our independent state. Just as 
important also is the principle that any crisis situation that 
lacks a constitutional solution must be excluded from the life 
of the state and society. 
  First, concerning situational, opportunist solutions [line 
illegible] processes is no secret, and it is sometimes said 
publicly in this connection even that the easiest way to adopt a 
constitution would be as follows: to adapt to the present 
correlation of political forces represented in parliament and to 
attempt to find some mutually acceptable version. 
  This would, indeed, be the easiest, but at the same time the 
most dangerous way for the state because, considering the 
variability of the correlation of political forces, it is not 
hard to divine the kind of upheavals in the future of which a 
constitution adopted in this way could be the cause. It would be 
the primary business of each newly elected parliament to 
immediately adapt the constitution to the new correlation of 
political forces, and so on ad infinitum. That is, the present 
struggle of the legislature and the executive to wrest powers 
away from one another, which is characteristic of all young 
independent states, would be a permanent factor of 
destabilization--with all the obvious negative consequences. 
  Mutual concessions, meanwhile, are encouraging and essential 
in the spheres of social symbiosis, the political modus 
operandi, and diplomacy but wholly unacceptable in the spheres 
of publicism and, particularly, jurisprudence, and consequently, 
for a constitution, which unequivocally belongs to the sphere of 
the latter, the possibility and expediency of political 
compromise should be considered precluded. We do not have the 
right, guided by opportunist, even if convenient, 
considerations, to jeopardize the future stability of the state. 
  The mere fact of affiliation to the sphere of jurisprudence, 
on the other hand, makes virtually obligatory for any 
constitution the following principle--the need for the 
assimilation of international experience, provided that 
contemporary law has been shaped historically as the result of 
the collective thought of mankind. 
  In this connection the draft of the Constitutional 
Commission 
almost totally reflects the principles of state independence and 
all the basic provisions of international laws concerning the 
rights of man and citizen and also the system of balances and 
developed mechanisms of the harmonious activity of state 
structures of modern democratic countries. 
  As far as the legislative tradition of the new independent 
Armenian state is concerned, the starting documents for the 
present draft constitution were the Declaration of Independence 
of Armenia, the laws on the president of the republic and the 
Supreme Council, and the law on the basic provisions of 
independent statehood. The said documents, which are the results 
of the activity exclusively of the present parliament, are not 
reflected in the Constitutional Commission's draft with absolute 
accuracy, of course, but have undergone serious revisions based 
both on the demands of the times and conformity to the current 
level of our legal and political maturity. 
  Taking this into account, I consider it my duty to observe 
that I am in no way disposed to think of the four years that 
have elapsed without a constitution lost time; on the contrary, 
I consider this to have been a time of effective years of the 
formation of new state structures, the creation of the 
corresponding legislative field, and the testing of the adopted 
laws, which will undoubtedly have a salutary impact on the 
future constitution of the republic. And even though a 
pessimistic or negative mood is predominant in today's 
parliament, from a historical angle its role in the elaboration 
of the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia is already, 
nonetheless, indisputable. 
  The present draft embodies, and with all due consistency, I 
believe, the principle providing for constitutional solutions 
for all possible crisis situations in the life of the state and 
society, which is the sole guarantor for the avoidance of 
undesirable forms of domestic political struggle and civil war. 
There is no particular need, I believe, to illustrate this 
danger, inasmuch as its best illustration is today's situation: 
It is obvious that the domestic political tension that is 
predominant today both in Armenia and in other republics of the 
former Union is to the highest extent the result of the simple 
reality that the constitution and the laws do not provide for 
legal solutions to critical situations. 
  The draft of the Constitutional Commission accomplishes this 
task in full, in my opinion. Specifically, it excludes the 
possibility of the stymieing of the adoption of most important 
laws presented by the government, including the state budget, 
and facilitates, as a counterbalance, the procedure of the 
expression of no confidence in the government. It develops in 
detail a mechanism of the removal from office of the president 
of the republic in the event of his having committed serious 
crimes. And, finally, as an extreme means of the surmounting of 
crisis situations, it provides for the possibility of the 
dissolution of the National Assembly and the scheduling of 
special elections. It is important to mention also in this 
connection that the National Assembly and the president of the 
republic are equally endowed with the exclusive right to 
schedule a referendum, which ensures the possibility of the 
avoidance of undesirable confrontations and the handover to the 
verdict of the people of contradictions that have arisen. 
  All the principles that have been set forth, which would 
hardly be cause for serious objection, have at this time, 
however, been set forth only on paper, and their actual 
application is as yet, understandably, still attended by great 
difficulties. We encounter once again here the ill-fated 
question of the procedure of adoption of the constitution. 
Having once fallen into the humiliating trap of the 
Stalin-Brezhnev Constitution, surely we would find within 
ourselves the power to cut this Gordian knot. Are there, 
however, doubts that, in the event of parliament's adoption of 
the constitution, all the said principles would be subordinated 
to the demands of the political marketplace and that a 
delayed-action bomb would thereby be placed in the foundations 
of our state? I am forced to repeat again and again, therefore, 
that under the conditions of the current political situation, 
only a constitution adopted by way of a public referendum, with 
the condition that it would subsequently be revised also only by 
way of a referendum, could be a dependable guarantee of the 
stability of the state. 
  And now about substantive aspects of the actual content of 
Constitutional Commission's draft. 
  It has to be noted first and foremost that this draft makes 
provision for the preservation of the system of presidential 
rule of the republic. This has to be noted because it is this, 
essentially, that is the main subject of the tumultuous 
arguments surrounding the constitution. And this is absolutely 
understandable, inasmuch as the fate of the constitution will 
ultimately depend on the question of the kind of system of 
government that the Republic of Armenia will adopt--presidential 
or parliamentary. It is perfectly certain also that, in the 
event of consensus on this matter being reached, the procedure 
of adoption of the constitution would become a purely technical 
task that was easily accomplished. 
  Considering the entire seriousness and justification of this 
alternative, I consider absolutely unacceptable the cheap 
demagogic methods with which an attempt is being made to portray 
the presidential system as a despotic, and the parliamentary 
system, a democratic, form of rule. In any event, historical 
experience has shown that tyrannies and fascist regimes have 
been born in parliamentary republics far more often than in 
presidential republics. 
  So the counterpoise of the presidential and parliamentary 
systems on a democratic basis should be considered fundamentally 
mistaken and unacceptable. The indicator of a state's 
democratism is not the presidential or parliamentary nature of 
the system of government, but whether a form of government by 
means of free elections has been established or not. What, 
ultimately, else is the essence of democracy if not free 
elections by means of which the people have an opportunity, if 
not to elect invariably good authorities, then, at least, to rid 
themselves of bad ones. 
  Thus, from the viewpoint of democracy, states are 
distinguished from one another not on the basis of the system of 
government but whether the authorities are elected or not. And 
for this reason both the presidential and parliamentary systems 
are equally democratic if they have been installed by means of 
free elections, and, accordingly, tyrannies and monarchies 
installed by different paths are undemocratic. 
  I have been forced to weary you, having dared to dwell in 
detail on these simple and hackneyed truths, because the 
aspiration to depict the presidential system as a tyranny is 
already threatening to become a subject of delusive speculation. 
  Essentially, the choice of a presidential or parliamentary 
system of government is connected not with the fact of 
democracy, but with the question of the extent to which one of 
these systems corresponds to the demands [line illegible] the 
state and to what extent it is capable of tackling the tasks 
confronting this state. 
  This way of framing the issue would be entirely apposite and 
to the point were it the substance not of a contrived but of a 
serious, philosophical dispute. It is hard, of course, within 
the framework of this speech of a general nature around this 
important matter to present a comprehensively argued analysis, 
and I shall attempt at this time, therefore, to content myself 
with an exposition merely of several basic propositions, even 
though they might not contain anything new for you. 
  I am once again forced in this connection, first, to call 
your attention to one false proposition by which an attempt is 
being made to elevate the question of the priority of the 
presidential or parliamentary system to the level of a 
phenomenon of a national-psychological nature. Statements to the 
effect that "the parliamentary system corresponds more than the 
presidential system to our national character or national 
mentality" and vice versa, whose groundlessness is obvious prima 
facie, may be heard frequently. 
  The question of the preference of a presidential or 
parliamentary system is, in fact, connected not with national or 
psychological factors but with state traditions, the level of 
development of the civil society, and the degree of formation of 
democratic institutions. Discussion of the matter even could 
make sense, therefore, only from this angle and provided that a 
common methodological starting point is established. 
  And this common starting point, in my opinion, is as 
follows: 
To what extent is the system of government that is preferred 
from the specific angle of the development of statehood and 
society capable of catering for the efficient and smooth 
activity of the legislature and the executive and a third 
factor--the independence of the judiciary. 
  Before turning to a discussion of this question, it is worth 
ascertaining, evidently, in what the essential, fundamental 
difference between the presidential and parliamentary systems of 
government consists. 
  It is by no means a question of terms; a state may have a 
president elected by parliament or by public ballot, even, but 
not in reality be presidential. It is essentially a question of 
which authority forms the government: If the president, we are 
dealing with a presidential system, if the said right is 
accorded parliament, this is a parliamentary republic, 
regardless of whether it has a president or not. Legal niceties 
play no part here. 
  From the formal viewpoint, the principle, albeit not 
absolute, nonetheless fundamental, of the separation of powers 
is violated in a parliamentary republic, since the executive is 
almost wholly dependent on the legislature. The formal aspect 
would be of no significance, of course, were it not for the 
negative influence of this dependence on the viability of the 
system of government and the efficiency of the activity of the 
legislature and the executive. 
  No one could, of course, deny the viability of a 
parliamentary system, but no one could deny either the fact that 
a parliamentary system is viable only in states in which one or, 
at the most, two or three serious mass parties, each of which is 
capable of forming a parliamentary majority and, thanks to this, 
ensuring the effective activity of the government, has taken 
shape historically. In the event of the election of patchwork, 
multiparty parliaments, the parliamentary system leads to the 
formation of a weak coalition government and incessant internal 
upheavals, which very often end in coups and tyranny and, 
frequently, outside interference also. 
  In the event of a parliamentary system being established, 
the 
same sorry and disastrous fate, I profoundly believe, awaits 
Armenia, because one or two or three serious, mass parties could 
take shape here only in dozens of years, at best. 
  I consider it superfluous to substantiate this conviction of 
mine with historical facts, of which there are a multitude. 
Although it is worth recalling in this connection the experience 
of the first Armenian Republic, when in its two and one-half 
years of existence there were four changes of government. Nor 
have we forgotten, I believe, the first 13 months of 
postcommunist Armenia, which should be seen as a most tense 
period of confrontation of the republic parliament and the 
government, for in the shortest time first the parliament 
voluntarily relinquished its powers of formation of the 
government, then things reached the point of the government 
resigning. 
  Thus, for at least several years into the future, there will 
be no alternative to the presidential form of government in the 
Republic of Armenia, in all probability. Even if thanks to a 
confluence of circumstances, parliamentary government were to be 
restored in Armenia, our republic would several years later, all 
the same, return to a presidential system; but at a price of 
tremendous deprivations and incalculable losses. I am sure, 
however, that our people will not make this absurd mistake. 
  I have already said that the viability of the system of 
government of this state or the other is conditioned by the 
extent to which it caters for the effective activity of the 
legislature and the executive and the independence of a third 
authority--the judiciary. 
  Aside from the elaboration of precise mechanisms fully 
balancing and ensuring the productive activity of parliament and 
the government, the draft of the Constitutional Commission has 
successfully resolved also, in my opinion, the problem of the 
independence of the judiciary. 
  The main guarantee of the independence of the judiciary 
according to this draft is the status of irremovability of the 
judges. This guarantee is strengthened considerably by the 
inclusion in the system of the judiciary of two new 
institutions--the Justice Council and the Constitutional Court, 
which will be formed on a proportional basis by the president of 
the republic and the National Assembly. 
  The Justice Council will present to the president of the 
republic candidates for deputy chairmen of the Supreme Court and 
members of the Supreme Court, and will present findings on the 
nominees for justices and in respect to the suspension and 
termination of the authority of justices. 
  The main competence of the Constitutional Court is the 
establishment of the conformity of laws, National Assembly 
decrees, and presidential edicts to the Constitution. The 
clearest evidence of the independence of the Constitutional 
Court is the fact that its decisions are final and not subject 
to review, which precludes any possibility of any pressure being 
brought to bear on it on the part of the president of the 
republic or the National Assembly. 
  A most important achievement of the draft of the 
Constitutional Commission should be considered the chapter 
devoted to questions of territorial government and local 
government, the essence of which consists in the rejection of 
the idea of territorial self-government, which is incongruous 
for Armenia. 
  This innovation, which at first sight seems staggering, is 
justified, however, by the unique reality ensuing from the 
particular features of our country and convincing arguments. 
  The formation of administrative-territorial units is, as a 
rule, a result of a historical process that has emerged as a 
consequence of feudal comminution or divisions ensuing from the 
tasks of the separate settlement of the population in 
multinational states. It cannot be ruled out, of course, that 
geographical and economic factors might have played a certain 
part in the formation of administrative-territorial units. But 
historical and ethnic factors have in all cases been decisive, 
especially since economic and geographical entities very often 
coincided with the borders of feudal or ethnic possessions. 
  Thus, the principle of territorial self-government ensues 
even in the most democratic countries not from republic 
interests or managerial expediency, but is preserved simply as a 
historical burden, which at times leads to serious clashes of 
state and local interests. Territorial self-government, 
aggravated by distinctive local interests, a proprietary budget, 
and sundry privileges, inevitably contains within it the element 
of federation, which is incongruous with the ever-growing 
aspirations to the formation of unitary states. Until these 
aspirations are justified, states attempt by means of laws to 
reduce to a minimum the contradictions that exist between state 
and local interests, but only a few, and only for a while, as a 
rule, succeed in achieving a complete harmony of interests. 
  Armenia, free of this historical burden and being in terms 
of 
its composition a mononational country, has an opportunity, 
unique in the world, to create a classical unitary state, which 
could be the most dependable guarantee of its stability, 
territorial integrity, and genuine independence.

<F P=106> [Article by Ida Martirosyan under the rubric "Parliament": </F>
"'The People Are Much More Intelligent...' As Before, the 
President Is for a Referendum"] 
  [Text] It can be said that the president's phrase about the 
fact that "a compromise on this question is impossible" has 
become paramount. One way or another the participants in the 
debate returned to it, and I must admit that I continued to 
expect that someone from the opposition would say something 
like: "If the president will not compromise even on this 
question, then what can be expected when his powers are 
broadened?! This is in reference to a very sore subject--the 
form of statehood: parliamentary or presidential. But although 
such an acute extreme was not heard, the extreme wing of the 
opposition in the person of Gagik Oganesyan (ARFD) [Armenian 
Revolutionary Federation Dashnak] noted that contrary to the 
thesis on the unacceptability of a compromise, it is exactly 
what is needed, and exactly now. And that the instability is 
exactly the result of the absence of a constitution. And, 
consequently, to avoid it, and for the sake of preserving 
stability; that is, in the interests of the people, a quicker 
adoption of the constitution is necessary exactly at the price 
of compromise. In his opinion, to submit all of the variants of 
the constitution to the judgment of the people is inadvisable, 
and it is necessary to arrive at a final draft through a 
constitutional assembly, which will then submit it to a 
referendum. This is really a compromise, judging by the fact 
that Gagik Oganesyan emphasized that he agrees with this, 
although he himself was always a supporter of parliamentary 
rule. His comment on why the communists were laboring on the 
creation of their own draft, when we have been living under 
their constitution up until now, evoked an appropriate reaction 
in the hall. Moreover, for the sake of fairness, it is necessary 
to note that this was not simply a dig. "We had a very 
democratic constitution and a very totalitarian regime." This 
statement was a key to the future--the issue was not so much and 
not only about how democratic and perfect the law is on paper as 
about how it is being put into effect. That is, if the president 
will be a dictator by nature, nothing will prevent him from 
"crushing" the basic law as well, for which there are examples 
in history. It is impossible to refute this conclusion either 
logically or with reason, the role of personality in 
history--contrary to what was taught in Soviet schools--is 
unquestionable. Moreover, to some degree it is the personality 
of the present leader that lies at the basis of conceptual 
disagreements about the role of the president in the future 
republic. Although it is obvious that the maximum perfection of 
the law is in its "paper execution," nevertheless, there is a 
guarantee of avoiding extremes, just as there is of putting the 
laws into effect. Incidentally, the latter is so important that 
it is difficult not to be amazed sometimes why there is all of 
this strife mainly around the role of the president, and not 
around the accuracy and clarity of other also significant 
circumstances. 
  In this connection, it is difficult to disregard the speech 
of Tigran Sarkisyan (NDU) [National Democratic Union]. 
Especially from the standpoint of the notorious parliamentary 
professionalism. He noted the political aspect casually: Not one 
of the submitted variants was perfect; therefore, it would be 
more sensible to settle on a draft for a transition period, but 
it will last for no less than 10 years, and it will be very 
painful. As yet, the social strata and mechanisms have not been 
formed--both economic and political--as a result of which there 
is no clear expression of their interests, their defense, and 
representation. Mr. Sarkisyan placed the main emphasis on the 
economic block of drafts, which it was generally feasible to 
expect from the leader of the finance-budgetary commission, and 
it demonstrated a professional approach. Mr. Sarkisyan said that 
the main flaw that was basic and common to all of the variants 
of the constitution in the block that he subjected to analysis 
was the sloganizing and the lack of accurate mechanisms. How 
does a budget come up for examination, who approves it, and who 
is responsible for it? It would seem that the government submits 
it, but what it is--the government--is not clear in even one 
variant. There is no list of its powers. What is more, as it 
becomes clear, it is not parliament that determines its 
structure. It turns out that both the structure and the 
formation of the Cabinet of Ministers is the prerogative of the 
government of this "something" that, nevertheless, possesses the 
powers to prolong the adoption of a vitally important decision 
for 30 days. Can the Supreme Soviet introduce changes to the 
budget that is submitted by the government? But, after all, this 
is an important point, as the last word--ratification--rests 
with parliament. But this is not specified in the drafts. But 
if, for example, the Supreme Soviet does not ratify the budget, 
and the government works in the old way, then maybe this is 
advantageous to it and it is what inspires or provokes 
hostility. But where are the stipulated mechanisms of mutual 
relations, the rights and duties, and the conditions of 
ratification or no ratification? Mr. Sarkisyan's summary about 
the need for a clear law on the government will hardly seem 
unimportant to anyone. It is more likely that it is precisely 
one of the elements for the "paper implementation" to be 
absolutely correct, just as is the element of another also--when 
the mechanisms are clearly designated, the probability of 
"starting them up", that is, putting them into effect, is 
increased significantly. 
  Rafik Mkhitaryan (KP) [Communist Party] in his speech turned 
attention to a bone of contention. He admitted that, formally, 
the draft, which was presented by the constitutional commission 
of the Supreme Soviet (the so-called presidential draft) meets 
the requirements of the standards. But the powers relegated to 
the president, nonetheless, are increased to such an extent that 
it will be necessary to rely on the personality, on the 
"specific executor." If he turns out to be a reasonable person, 
there will be no problems; otherwise, the specter of a 
dictatorship will assume a very real outline. As for the draft 
of the "six", then although it also proposes a "mixed" 
government, the importance of the president is so formal that 
one is at a loss as to why it should be kept in general, plus 
maintain a necessary and large staff? Comrade Mkhitaryan is 
confident: The "compromising" synthesis of the submitted 
variants is unreasonable, and they should all be submitted to 
the judgment of the people. 
  In light of the recent political "shocks" outside the walls 
of the Supreme Soviet (the letter of the seven, which proposes a 
split in the AOD [Armenian Pan National Movement], the work of 
the commission on abuses in the upper echelons of authority, 
etc.), one could launch into an analysis of why the 
representative of the ruling party, contrary to the attitude of 
the president on not compromising, called for the opposite? 
However, although interesting this would deviate from the 
subject. Nevertheless, Ter-Iusik Lazaryan noted that it would be 
advisable to expand the constitutional commission by adding 
representatives of the parties, factions, authors of all five 
drafts, and once again to examine everything, and to synthesize 
everything and submit a final variant for a decision by the 
people. 
  The speech of Shavarsha Kocharyan (NDU)--for both 
emotionality and, perhaps, for substance can be categorized as 
extreme. It is true that at the beginning he noted that even the 
variant of the "six" and also the presidential variant are 
democratic in form, and the question, nevertheless, is which one 
is preferable for us. As for the compromising "synthesized" 
variant, it can lead to instability. The history of Turkey and 
France are an example of this: According to the words of Mr. 
Kocharyan, except for perhaps the United States, there is no 
other model of a presidential government that would lead to 
positive results. Consequently, there is no doubt, in fact, that 
a definite struggle for power is concealed behind the debate on 
the form of authority. In making the concluding remarks, 
Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan said that the four-day 
debate convinced him of the correctness of the propositions 
expressed by him on the first day of the discussions. The 
president once again emphasized that he rules out compromise in 
ideology. The Communist Party cannot reject communism, the ARF 
[Armenian Revolutionary Federation] cannot reject the Ay Dat 
[constitution], and the AOD and the Liberal Democrats cannot 
reject the idea of private property. 
  Levon Ter-Petrosyan said: "If you want to make a salad out 
of 
this version of the constitution, then we will perish. The claim 
that allegedly the people cannot accept the constitution is 
cheap demagogy. Collectively, the people are much more 
intelligent than everyone sitting here separately and taken 
together." In the opinion of the president, the only way to 
adopt the constitution is through a referendum. Today, the 
Supreme Soviet can also make a determination on this question, 
but if it does not cope with it, there are other legal avenues. 
The president can gather 200,000 votes in favor of supporting a 
referendum. However, L. Ter-Petrosyan called this an "extreme 
means." He will be satisfied if the four-day meeting leads to 
some definite result. One of the five variants should be 
approved as a basis. In the event that the variant of the 
constitutional commission is adopted, the president will agree 
to an expansion of its staff, as was proposed by a number of 
deputies. If there will be no approved variant, the 
constitutional commission will have to yield its powers, and the 
work will be continued by a new commission. 
  In the opinion of the head of the state, the variant of the 
basic law developed by the constitutional commission can be 
improved--he personally has reservations about this draft. L. 
Ter-Petrosyan emphasized that out of the three proposals 
submitted by Deputy Yuriy Sarkisyan, a member of the commission, 
he accepts two--on the dissolution of parliament and on the 
appointment of the prime minister. The question on the 
appointment of the Supreme Court, which in this draft is 
appointed for life, can be reconsidered. 
  The Armenian president emphasized that he has established 
the 
condition: After the adoption of the constitution, elections of 
the new Supreme Soviet and president will be scheduled. 
  One way or another, if it is possible to put it this way, 
the 
strategy of the uncompromising compromise was victorious. 
According to the results of the voting, it was decided to expand 
the staff of the commission by adding political organizations 
that have representatives in the Supreme Soviet, but that are 
not represented on the constitutional commission. 
Simultaneously, the speaker--B. Ararktsyan--was elected its 
cochairman. A decision was also made to continue the work of the 
special session to 27 June. The arena of battles seems to have 
narrowed, but it is difficult to determine whether they will 
become less uncompromising even after the compromising nature of 
the adopted decision.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gennadiy Tretyakov, chairman of the </F>
Commission on International Relations and Contacts with Public 
and State Organizations of the Republic of the Communist Party 
of Azerbaijan, by Nair Aliyev, ZERKALO correspondent; place and 
date not given: "'Only the Russian Plan for a Peaceful 
Settlement Appears To Be the Most Realistic Today.'"] 
  [Text] Responding to questions of a ZERKALO correspondent, 
G. Tretyakov said that this was his personal point of view, and 
that it might not coincide with the opinion of the party. 
  [Aliyev] What do you think of the signing of the oil 
contract 
with Western countries? After all, this actually denotes 
investments of the so-called capitalist countries in the 
Azerbaijani economy? 
  [Tretyakov] Not long ago I was asked almost the same 
question 
by Mr. Thomas Young, ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary of Great Britain to Azerbaijan. I answered him, 
and I answer you now, that I am for investment in the 
Azerbaijani economy both on the part of the so-called 
capitalistic England, and on the part of Communist China. But, 
at the same time, any contracts that are being signed must be 
mutually beneficial so that their fruits can be enjoyed by 
workers, peasants, and the intelligentsia, the present and 
future generations, and not by a small group of highly placed 
officials who already have their foreign currency accounts in 
Western banks. 
  [Aliyev] You said that "the contracts must be mutually 
beneficial"--does this mean that you think the current 
conditions of the contract are not beneficial? 
  [Tretyakov] I am not familiar with the draft of this 
contract, inasmuch as, to all appearances, it is a well-kept 
secret. I think that questions that are of such importance to 
the republic should be widely publicized in order not to cause 
unnecessary false rumors. 
  [Aliyev] What do you think of the convocation of the 
National 
Assembly of the Azerbaijani Republic and the dissolution of the 
Milli Majlis? 
  [Tretyakov] The creation of the Milli Majlis at the October 
session of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan in 1991 was a gross 
violation of the existing Constitution of the Azerbaijani 
Republic and the Constitutional Act on the State Independence of 
Azerbaijan. 
  I thought then and I think now that the Milli Majlis was an 
illegitimate organ. The activity of the National Assembly only 
compromises the idea of parliamentary government. The parliament 
elected by the people (about 360 deputies), whatever its 
composition might be, but recognized by the world community, was 
actually removed from work, and 50 deputy members of the Milli 
Majlis are making fateful decisions for the people that 
frequently contradict each other and sometimes do not respond at 
all to the interests of Azerbaijan. For example, without 
conducting a referendum and without finding out about the 
opinions of the people, the Milli Majlis is making a decision on 
calling the Azerbaijani language and the nation Turkish. The 
Azerbaijani people have their own ancient culture that occupies 
a place of dignity in world culture. It is necessary to take 
pride in it, and to propagate it, and not to rename the language 
and the nation. 
  I think that it will be necessary in the near future to 
convene a session of the National Assembly and to make a 
decision on the conduct of early elections of a new parliament 
of the republic, both according to the majority and the 
proportional system. 
  [Aliyev] Does your party support relations with other 
parties 
of a leftist orientation? 
  [Tretyakov] We support relations and we contact all parties 
of a leftist orientation, with trade unions, public 
associations, and charitable societies. I cannot say that our 
positions are similar on all questions, but we can find a common 
language on some of them. 
  [Aliyev] And nevertheless, name a party of a leftist 
orientation with which you maintain relations. 
  [Tretyakov] We maintain relations with all of them. 
  [Aliyev] How does the Communist Party see the resolution of 
the Karabakh conflict? 
  [Tretyakov] A meeting between the leadership of the 
Communist 
Party of Azerbaijan (R. Akhmedov) and the leadership of the 
Communist Party of Armenia (S. Badalyan) was held in Moscow 
recently under the aegis of the Central Executive Committee of 
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (G. Zyuganov). One 
of the questions discussed at the meeting was the question 
concerning Nagornyy Karabakh, about which we approved a joint 
trilateral communique. The Communist Party of Azerbaijan 
declared that it has stood and will stand on the positions of 
territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani Republic and on the 
positions of the rights and freedoms of every citizen regardless 
of nationality and place of residence--Khankendi, Baku, or 
Yerevan. In the communique we supported the signing of the 
Bishkek Protocol and the principle of peaceful negotiations. In 
supporting the signing of the Bishkek Protocol, I believe that 
all three stages of this plan must be fulfilled. Many of the 
current high-standing officials and part of the opposition came 
out against the signing of the protocol. But they are not 
thinking of the fact that the gene pool is being destroyed, that 
young, untrained soldiers are perishing by the hour, who leave 
behind orphaned children, widowed wives, and aged parents. Of 
course, they do not think about this; after all, their children 
are not at war, and many of them are abroad, leading a sweet 
life. 
  There are more than 1 million refugees in the republic who 
are living under dreadful conditions--let the politicians ponder 
what awaits our people after this bloody war. 
  [Aliyev] Does this mean that you see a resolution of the 
conflict only within the scope of the Russian plan for a 
peaceful settlement? 
  [Tretyakov] I see only the Russian plan for a peaceful 
settlement of the conflict as the most realistic today, inasmuch 
as other forces that could stop this war do not exist now. Any 
introduction of peacekeeping forces of the CIS and their 
presence on the territory of Azerbaijan should occur in 
compliance with norms that are generally accepted by the 
international community.

<F P=106> [Article by G. Kozlova: "Passports of the Former USSR Become </F>
Invalid by the end of 1996"] 
  [Text] The principle task of the new laws passed by 
the Milli Majlis [as published] at the last session is to return 
to the passport its original significance as a document used for 
going abroad and to introduce a new document--the identity card 
of a citizen of the Azerbaijani Republic--for use within the 
boundaries of Azerbaijan. 
  Eldar Mamedov, supervisor of the department of 
administrative 
and military legislation of the Supreme Soviet, which prepared 
the draft laws "On Exiting the Country, Entering the Country, 
and Passports," and also "On the Identity Card of a Citizen of 
the Azerbaijani Republic," noted that these laws are on the 
territory of the former USSR for the first time. They brought 
into conformity with international standards the procedures for 
entry into and exit from the country, they simplified the 
issuance of the indicated documents to a maximum, they clearly 
consolidated the legal position of citizens going abroad, and 
also the procedure for entry into Azerbaijan and exit from it by 
foreigners. 
  For the first time, these and many other questions 
associated 
with them will be decided in our country not on the basis of 
departmental instructions of the MFA [Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs], the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], and the KGB, 
which are not available to citizens, but on the basis of laws of 
the state that are binding on both officials and citizens. 
  "We made the laws flexible enough and as clear as possible, 
and leaving as few opportunities as possible for bureaucratic 
procrastination in their fulfillment," Mamedov noted. "The law 
itself proclaims the primacy of the norms of international law 
in the event of any kinds of contradictions. With the adoption 
of these laws by parliament, Azerbaijan took a big step on the 
path to the construction of a democratic society. Azerbaijan 
actually showed what attention is paid in the republic to the 
fulfillment of obligations that it assumed after joining the 
general declaration on human rights and other international 
pacts on human rights." 
  The law clearly stipulates that no one can deprive a citizen 
of the right to free movement through customs and border points 
in a publicly safe method at any time. He can leave and return 
to the country at any time. 
  Practically all of the previously valid obstacles are being 
removed, and natural temporary restrictions are associated only 
with those exceptional cases when a citizen's obligations are in 
effect concerning not divulging state or military secrets, or in 
the event that criminal proceedings are brought against him and 
he is convicted, or if he is called up for active compulsory 
military service in the established legal procedure. 
  A citizen's going abroad will be conducted on the basis of a 
general citizen's passport, but for some officials, a list of 
whom is clearly designated in law, official or diplomatic 
passports will be used that are specially issued for this. 
Representatives of the third branch--the Constitutional Court, 
the Supreme Court, and the Higher Court of Arbitration--are 
included for the first time among persons who have a right to a 
diplomatic passport. 
  All citizens who go outside the boundaries of Azerbaijan 
will 
be able to enjoy not only all of their constitutional rights, 
including the right to pension support, but also to carry out 
their duties as citizens of Azerbaijan. It is stipulated that 
they have the right to take out property that belongs to them 
and their family, except for objects that have been taken out of 
civilian circulation (for example, cultural valuables). 
  The types and procedures for issuing visas to foreigners and 
the periods of their stay in Azerbaijan have been consolidated 
for the first time. The second law provides for the issuance by 
Internal Affairs organs, according to place of residence, of two 
types of plastic identity cards for persons up to 16 years of 
age and older than 16 years of age, which will be exchanged when 
citizens reach 25, 35, and 50 years of age, or in the event of a 
change in last name, first name, patronymic, place of residence, 
family situation, military service obligations, and also if they 
were lost or are worn out. 
  The new laws will go into effect starting on 1 January 1995, 
but passports of the former Soviet Union will continue to be 
valid on the territory of the republic until 31 December 1996.

<F P=106> [Article by Aldona Svirbutaviciute: "Those Who Are Able, </F>
Don't Want To, While Those Who Want To, Aren't Able"] 
  [Text] While the new ministerial portfolios are being 
assigned in the lobbies, Seimas managed to ratify the future 
number of ministers. There will be not 18, as we reported a week 
ago, but 19. A Ministry of Environmental Protection will be 
established on June 15, and in the middle of July the Ministry 
of Culture and Education will be divided into two -- a Ministry 
of Culture and a Ministry of Education and Science. Around 
autumn a Ministry of Government Reform and Local Administration 
will be established. (Just last week it was said only two new 
ministers would be appointed.) 
  Discussions are taking place in the Seimas corridors, and 
not 
only there, about potential candidates for the ministerial 
posts. The Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] members of 
Seimas became acquainted with several of them on Monday at a 
meeting of their faction. 
  I interviewed faction members and asked them to answer a few 
questions. Seimas member V. Petkevicius described Albertas 
Vasiliauskas, the future minister of forestry, very positively. 
He said that the candidate is both a scientist and a man of 
practical affairs, who understands very well the problems of 
both commercial forestry and nature conservation. "In the end, 
the decision on ministerial candidates is not made by 
Petkevicius alone or Rupeika alone. That is a prerogative of the 
president and the government," said the author. 
  The faction may voice its opinion about the future 
candidates, but it will not be they who make the decision. 
  In V. Petkevicius's opinion, it is necessary to split the 
ministries of education and culture. He said with a laugh that 
the present minister sits on two chairs; one day he sits with 
education administrators, then on the next with a group of 
cultural workers. 
  A. Lozuraitis, a member of the LDDP faction's hierarchy, 
also 
gave his opinion. He said that the discussion in the faction 
does not constitute a final decision. It is quite possible that 
other candidates exist or will appear. "It is very complicated 
to talk about aspirants in advance, because there is often a 
conflict of strong, passionate opinions. You can't hide the fact 
that some persons are patrons of certain candidates, proposing 
and pushing them, while others criticize them. So this process 
does not have a clear procedure so far. Neither the faction, nor 
Seimas appoints the ministers, but there is a striving to make 
the search for ministers more public, respecting everyone's 
opinion," said A. Lozuraitis. 
  A. Kuncinas, the assistant head of the faction, said that a 
businesslike conversation had taken place on Monday with the 
ministerial candidates, who had answered questions. According to 
him, the faction does not make any decisions, it can only 
express its opinion to the prime minister, who is the chairman 
of the party. A. Kuncinas said that the ministers will be 
discussed again in the faction and in the party presidium. 
  By the way, we found out that the list of ministerial 
candidates is far longer than was known until now. A ministerial 
post (in the Ministry of Education and Science) is being offered 
to A. Lozuraitis. Asked to comment about this news, he said: 
  - That always flatters one's ego, but one must know one's 
limitations. I took this proposal to be a humorous one... I 
don't consider it serious... 
  - Is that possible? After all, it's doubtful that the 
persons 
who made the proposal did it as a joke. 
  - I think that they know me less well than I know myself. 
  A. Kuncinas, the assistant head of the faction, summarized 
this mini-interview: "That's the way it is. Those who could be a 
minister don't want to, while sometimes those who are pushing to 
get the post are not capable of heading a ministry... "

<F P=106> ["A Declaration by the Lithuanian Periodical Press </F>
Publishers Association (LSA)"] 
  [Text] The state enterprise for press distribution 
"Lithuania's Press" (not included in the list of specific state 
enterprises), which as a monopoly set prices unjustified by 
economic considerations for its services in connection with the 
selling of the press, increased its joint stock through excess 
profits, and on 24 March 1994 registered with the Vilnius city 
government as a joint stock company. 
  A privately owned company has become an organization 
controlling a critically important service, the retail trade in 
newspapers and magazines. 
  "Lithuania's Press," which has been dictating unfavorable 
terms to the periodical press (a faulty system of settling 
accounts, in which the sellers are compensated for only 12000060100f 
the loss from unsold periodicals, limits placed an the 
distribution of new periodicals, etc.), is now escaping 
government control. 
  Since there is no alternative system of distributing the 
press -- to create it requires large capital investments -- the 
privatization of this enterprise changes in an essential way the 
situation of the press in our country. 
  Not only hundreds of press kiosks in the best locations in 
Lithuanian cities and small towns became the shareholders' 
property, paid for from residual profits, but also one of the 
largest buildings in Lithuania -- the multistory house on 
Laisves Prospectas in Vilnius -- another large piece of state 
property. A group of people now has the right to decide which 
periodicals to disseminate and which ones not to. Newspapers and 
magazines are left unprotected against arbitrary actions by the 
distributors, dividing periodicals into "good" and "bad," 
creating a precondition for censorship of the press; the press 
may lose the common equality under which it operates in the 
marketplace. There is no guarantee that one fine day we won't be 
left without newspapers -- it is the intent of the stockholders 
to change the profile of the enterprise's activities (the heads 
of "Lithuania's Press" have explained more than once that it is 
more profitable to sell beer and cigarettes than periodicals). 
  The newspaper and magazine publishers are uneasy about the 
fact that a monopoly service is given over to private hands. The 
distribution of the press in our country is becoming 
unpredictable. A threat has appeared to the economic and 
political freedoms of the press, to the entire free press, the 
guarantee of democracy and stability of the country. 
  [Signed] Rimantas Sukys, president of the Lithuanian 
Periodical Press Publishers Association.

<F P=106> [BNS report: "Lithuania's Economy in April: Industrial </F>
Production Decreased, but Exports to the West Increased"] 
  [Text] This April Lithuanian industry produced 24.3 percent 
less goods for consumers than in March. The volume of industrial 
production and sales showed an increase for the first time this 
year in March, when, in comparison to February, there was a 14 
percent increase in production for consumers. 
  According to the data of the Statistics Department, 
industrial processing and production decreased by 17 percent in 
April, and by 10 percent, if oil processing is not counted. The 
supply of electrical energy, heating, gas and water decreased by 
49.5 percent, the production of electrical energy by 62 percent. 
Meanwhile, 14 percent more electrical energy was used for 
production purposes in March than in February. 
  Industrial production of consumer goods in April totaled 
more 
than 900 million litas; of that figure 760 million litas came 
from the processing sector. Less timber and fewer timber 
products, cellulose and paper products, electronic machines, 
radios, televisions, communications equipment, electric 
machines, medicine, and precision instruments were sold in April 
than in March. Of 70 basic industrial products, production 
increased for 20, decreased for 47, 1 remained unchanged, and 2 
were not produced at all: sugar and soft roofing materials. 
  Compared to March, in April there was a sharp decrease in 
production of varnish and paint (87 percent), primary oil 
processing (76 percent), television sets (71 percent), 
metal-cutting machine tools (60 percent), natural fur products 
(57 percent), canned fruits and vegetables (52 percent), and 
electric energy (62 percent). The greatest increase was in 
production of compressors for consumer refrigerators (153 
percent), bedding (120 percent), powdered milk products (88 
percent), rust-proof building materials (81 percent), and fish 
products other than canned fish (77 percent). 
  Exports to the West grew to 15.2 percent in April. This is 
the largest figure for this year (in January it was 11.4 
percent, in February 13 percent, in March 13.8 percent). There 
was an insignificant increase in production sold to the domestic 
market: 54 percent, compared to 53.8 percent in March. 
<H5>  Turnover of Goods </H5>
  The Statistics Department reports that annual comparative 
prices in Lithuania's domestic market decreased 28.7 percent. 
As compared to last year's April prices, the turnover of goods 
decreased 13.5 percent. 
  Compared to March, in April goods turnover was 4.4 percent 
smaller in actual prices and 5.9 percent smaller in comparative 
prices. Total value of goods sold in state, cooperative and 
large private stores was 283 million litas in April. Counting 
commodities circulation in all private stores and markets, a 
total of 431 million litas worth of goods was sold in April. 
There were fewer basic food and non-food products supplied to 
the domestic market in April than in March, and more hosiery and 
leather footwear. 
<H5>  Eggs Cheaper, Salt and Transportation More Expensive </H5>
  Inflation in Lithuania was 1.6 percent in April, and 13.3 
percent in the first four months of this year. Last year it was 
83.1 percent during the same period. Food prices increased 
insignificantly in April (0.4 percent). The price of eggs fell 
again (-6.1 percent), as well as for herring (-3.7 percent), 
frozen fish and potatoes (-2.1 percent), meat and cooking oil 
(-1.2 percent). 
  Meanwhile prices rose for salt (7 percent), cheese (5.4 
percent), fresh vegetables (3.3 percent), grains (3.2 percent), 
mineral water (2.5 percent), canned fruits and juices (2.4 
percent), and fresh fish (2.1 percent). Prices rose in April for 
clothing (2.7 percent). With the change of seasons, prices rose 
for footwear (1.7 percent), and especially for shoe repair (20.9 
percent). 
  Housing costs increased 11.5 percent. This statistic was 
influenced by increased costs for garbage disposal (40 percent), 
maintenance/repair (15.7 percent), apartment rental fees (7.8 
percent), and cold water (5.2 percent). Other non-food goods 
also became more expensive: drugs (6.8 percent), toys (4.5 
percent), garden tools (4.2 percent), carpets and floor covering 
(3.5 percent), household fabrics and bedding (2.4 percent). 
  Transportation costs rose significantly in April: prices 
rose 
for long-distance passenger travel (32.4 percent), 
transportation equipment maintenance (9.8 percent), local 
passenger travel (9.5 percent), and drivers education (8.7 
percent). During the past month prices rose significantly for 
the services of stomatologists (12.6 percent), barbers (7.7 
percent), photographers (6.4 percent), and for undertakers (6.2 
percent), and furniture repair (5.2 percent). 
  The price of fuel, electrical energy, communications 
services, long-term recreational goods, and notary, legal, and 
insurance services did not rise at all in April.

<F P=106> [TIESA article : "How Sowing is Progressing"] </F>
  [Text] By 23 May, agricultural associations and farmers in 
Lithuania had sown 760,400 hectares of their fields with summer 
crops. On the basis of information from the Statistics 
Department, ELTA reports that this is 12 percent more than last 
year. 
  Of this total 564,000 hectares are devoted to grain or 
leguminous crops, representing an increase of 15 percent; 31,400 
hectares are planted with sugar beets, which is a 4 percent 
larger area than last year. A total of 43,300 hectares, 
representing an increase of 3 percent over last year, are 
planted with potatoes, and, with a total of 10,200 hectares, 
there is almost a third more land than last year planted with 
vegetable crops. 
  This year, up to 70 percent of the total amount foreseen has 
already been planted by farmers on their land, according to 
Aniceta Sapoliene, head of the Agriculture and Forestry 
Statistics section of the Statistics Department. Meanwhile, a 
total of 330,100 hectares of summer crops have been planted on 
land belonging to agricultural associations. 246,000 hectares 
are devoted to grain and leguminous crops, 13,900 hectares to 
sugar beets, 5,300 hectares to flax, 6,700 hectares to the 
summer rape plant crop, 38,600 hectares to annual grass crops. 
  The largest areas of land under crops were in Panevezys 
(20,500 hectares), Kedainiai (18,000), Pasvalys (17,000), and 
Joniskis (13,000) district agricultural association fields. 
  Of winter grain crops, 13,500 hectares or 6 percent of the 
total area planted with these crops, were lost during the winter.

<F P=106> [Article by Raimonda Rameliene: "V. Landsbergis: `Elections </F>
in the Spring are the Way Out of the Crisis'"] 
  [Text] At a press conference at the Seimas yesterday, V. 
Landsbergis, the leader of the rightist opposition, stated that 
a crisis has gripped the country's current government and that 
this crisis is very "evident in debates dealing with the fate of 
the government." According to the professor, the various 
discussions indicate that the ruling party itself comprehends 
that the government is not coping with its tasks, and this was 
why it was looking for someone to blame. The non-party 
ministers, justice minister J. Prapiestis and finance minister 
E. Vilkelis, could become these "scapegoats." 
  The LDDP, with no younger members in its ranks and therefore 
without a future, is rushing about looking for a way out and for 
personnel who could be nominated for positions in the 
government. Alas, the LDDP reserve ranks consist of only the old 
nomenklatura. Can another government be formed from the same 
resources, could it work better with such a majority? "It is 
clear that this would not be worthwhile," Landsbergis said. 
However, it seems that there are reserves in other parties, and 
the opposition could without a doubt form a government, although 
there is no purpose in doing so with the kind of majority that 
currently exists in the Seimas. And the LDDP will not fool very 
many people by changing ministers in the current government. 
This is why the theoretical discussion initiated by the LDDP on 
a party-based, political-based, or competence-based government 
does not make much sense either. Here you have continual 
contradictions "which are outlined particularly exhaustively in 
the article by Mr. Kirkilas in TIESA." The professor analyzed 
and commented upon this article (which appeared on 21 May) in 
some detail; he also drew quite a few conclusions. One of these 
was that the composition of the new government would be 
deliberated "not by the entire LDDP convention, but rather by 
some kind of politburo." The president would not be a 
participant either, but rather, it appears, would only execute 
the decisions. Also, the statements made by the president 
himself are quite contradictory: in speaking all the time about 
the stability of the government he says that a fundamental 
renewal of the government is required. "It seems that stability 
applies only to the very top or to the confirmation in the 
Seimas of the same personnel who are already in the government, 
in order to create the illusion that the government is new, and 
that it should not be criticized for a period of time. Or maybe 
this is simply avoiding responsibility," V. Landsbergis said. 
  In that same article by G. Kirkilas, there is "an unclear 
offer of coalition to those who are unnecessarily issuing 
interpellations," according to the professor. Obviously the LDDP 
comprehends that the burden of governing is not after all so 
simple. This is why the "old gimmick" was again being used, 
namely, that the opposition had refused to cooperate. This was 
not true, because the opposition had refused only after "being 
kicked": it had offered on a number of occasions to reach 
agreement reasonably on some very concrete issues. But the 
ruling party had not accepted a single proposal, because it is 
convinced that it alone has a mandate to govern the country. The 
results are plain to see: internally, great damage resulting 
from the governing of the LDDP, and abroad, time has been wasted 
in many areas learning some elementary things. The only good 
thing is that the LDDP is already beginning to understand that 
it is necessary to be more oriented toward the West. 
  So the only "democratic and civilized" way out of the 
current 
crisis is to hold new elections next spring, in the opinion of 
the leader of the opposition. The Seimas itself could make such 
a decision. V. Landsbergis called the initiative by the 
Nationalists for early elections correct, but said they had not 
quite started in time. For this reason, the initiative might be 
unsuccessful.

<F P=106> [Article by Raimonda Rameliene: "C. Jursenas: `There is No </F>
Government Crisis'"] 
  [Text] "I get the impression that there is a certain 
confusion in the ranks of our dear and respected friends on the 
right. It appears that signatures for referendums are being 
successfully gathered and that everything is all right. At the 
same time, they are throwing various accusations back and forth 
and are resorting to various means, as if they (the rightists) 
were not convinced how one referendum or the other will come 
out. Or perhaps they already know the outcome, and are therefore 
rushing about in confusion in advance," Seimas chairman C. 
Jursenas stated yesterday at a press conference. 
  According to Jursenas, amendments to the Referendum Law are 
being actively attacked now. What is overlooked, however, is 
that it is difficult to organize any kind of referendum on the 
basis of the currently valid Referendum Law, which dates back to 
the Soviet era. "Especially interesting is the attempt" to set 
the president and the Seimas against each other, which is being 
done by one faction (the Christian Democrats--R.R.) with its 
memorandum. This memorandum proposes to the president that he 
make use of specific regulations and articles of the 
Constitution, especially article 58, which outlines how the 
president can dismiss the Seimas prematurely. "Some are doing 
one thing, others are doing something else, but the efforts 
point in the same direction as they attempt to introduce 
confusion and set people against each other, in the hope that 
something might after all come of it," Jursenas said in speaking 
about the activities of the rightists. 
  Regarding the amendments to the Referendum Law, the Seimas 
chairman once again stressed that according to the Constitution, 
only the Seimas can adopt constitutional laws, whereas only 
regulations, not laws or their instructions, are adopted by 
means of referendums. In addition, the president's powers cannot 
be expanded beyond the limits outlined in the Constitution. One 
would have to change the Constitution itself if the goal were to 
implement the aforementioned actions. Up to now, no such 
amendments have been received. 
  Commenting on Landsbergis' assertion regarding a 
governmental 
crisis in the country, C. Jursenas noted that talk about a 
crisis had started back at the end of October 1992, after the 
first round of elections. 
  In the speaker's opinion, the rightists had instigated a 
crisis artificially in 1992: the Supreme Council was still able 
to work successfully. But some people wanted a government 
constituted differently and they ended up hurting themselves. 
  C. Jursenas said that he saw no government crisis at this 
time: the Seimas, President, and government are working actively 
and intensively. Of course, when the country's economic and 
social situations are difficult, the reaction of some government 
representatives is inadequate. This is why such broad 
conclusions are being drawn from this reaction as well as from 
the fact that certain Seimas members are flustered. With 
reference to the government as a whole, however, there is no 
crisis; the impression that there is one is being artificially 
inflated, relying on the fact that life is hard. Why is it hard? 
Because the current government inherited the kind of situation 
that cannot be changed in a year. Finally, a mandate was given 
for four to five years, so an accounting will come when these 
years have passed. "We'll talk about all these matters in 1996." 
  And with respect to this government, the Seimas chairman is 
"more or less pleased." If something needs to be changed, it 
will be changed. This is already foreseen and presents no 
problem.

<F P=106> [Article by PL staff correspondent: "The Baltics Could Use a </F>
Fund for Venture Capital"] 
  [Text] 
  TALLINN (PL). The annual meeting of the European Bank 
of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) held in St. Petersburg 
turned out to be very successful for Estonia. According to 
finance minister Heiki Kranich, who represented Estonia at the 
meeting, EBRD president Jacques de Larosi&egrave;re showed a 
lively 
interest in things Estonian, and was ready to consider some of 
Estonia's proposals. He also expressed hope that "results of the 
meeting held between Estonia and the EBRD could soon be 
felt." 
  Estonia expected more in the way of flexibility and 
risk-taking from the bank than there has been before. Of the 
latter special attention was given to establishing a venture 
capital fund with resources coming from the EBRD. Out of the 
resources of such a fund, investments would be channeled 
directly into the equity base of a venture, and the bank would 
become a shareholder in Estonian enterprises through the fund. 
Kranich said that the creation of a joint fund for the Baltics 
was also being discussed at the St. Petersburg meeting. Since 
the levels of the Baltic states are different at the moment, 
Kranich proposed that the fund be first activated in Estonia, 
and later expanded to the other Baltic states. EBRD's board of 
directors did pass a resolution, in principle, to increase its 
investments of startup capital for new ventures. So far, EBRD's 
involvement in Estonia has been limited mainly to the state 
sector. In the future, however, more attention will be paid to 
the private sector. 
  Delegates from Estonia had longer talks with representatives 
of the Nordic Countries Bank of Investments and Japanese 
financial institutions. 
  United States' Stanley Morgan was willing to measure 
Estonia's credit rating to its lenders by international 
standards. Enn Pant, chancellor of the Finance Ministry was of 
the opinion that, at the moment, Estonia's rating is quite 
favorable. Stanley Morgan also offered his help with the issue 
of state obligations and corporate shares. Japan's Namura 
International, however, showed great interest in Estonia's ports. 
  Those attending the EBRD annual meeting attributed great 
significance to the loan agreement signed between the 
Export-Import Bank of Japan, EBRD and Estonia, which opened up a 
$3 million credit line. Martin Poder, vice chancellor of 
the 
Finance Ministry, said that this credit can be used for "joint 
financing with EBRD in cooperation on projects being carried 
out." The agreement is also expected to enhance further direct 
cooperation with the Export-Import Bank of Japan. 
  Heiki Kranich remarked that Estonia was the first 
East-European country to start negotiating for such an agreement 
and that, in the course of negotiations, it was also joined by 
Latvia and Lithuania. 
  At the EBRD annual meeting, favorable recognition was also 
given to relations between Estonia and the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF). What deserves notice in this connection, 
Kranich said, is not that the IMF directives are being followed 
blindly, but rather that the positions taken by the Estonian 
government and the IMF coincide. "Estonia is the favorite of 
IMF," was one of the remarks heard at the EBRD annual meeting. 
  The finance ministers of the three Baltic states are 
planning 
to meet in June of this year, for a further discussion of 
possible cooperative projects.

<F P=106> [Article by Lidiya Ruta: "The Bungler is a Bad Workman </F>
Everywhere"] 
  [Text] The governments of Ukraine and the Russian 
Federation have drawn up an agreement concerning cooperation in 
the area of consumer rights protection. The agreement was signed 
by L. Bochyn, head of the Russian Federation State Committee for 
Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic Structures and 
V. Yermakov, head of the State Committee for the Protection of 
Consumer Rights in Ukraine. 
  There was a press conference after the signing of the 
agreement. 
  --How will the agreement benefit the rank and file 
consumers? 
the journalists asked L. Bochyn. 
  --The signing of the agreement will untie our hands, so to 
speak, and will help to control our Russian, and your Ukrainian 
unscrupulous producers, to resolve problems of technical 
servicing of comples domestic technology such as radio sets, 
constructed in both countries, and guarantee spare parts, etc. 
In other words, normal, civilized forms of cooperation between 
countries will be in effect. 
  --But many feel that the law of Ukraine concerning consumers 
rights protection, let us say, is more oriented towards the 
interests of consumers, than the corresponding law of the 
Russian Federation. Won't these discrepancies become a stumbling 
block in consumer rights protection in Ukraine? 
  --In order for consumers of Ukraine and Russia to be an 
equal 
level, says L. Bochyn, we must first make the laws equal. But in 
the final analysis, it is not a matter of the constitutionality 
of the law but its realization; the specific protection of 
consumer rights. If we go through 16.5 thousand cases and they 
all turn out to the advantage of the consumer - this says 
something. Normally, any type of law requires a definite 
compromise between enterprises-manufacturers and structures 
called on to protect consumers. 
  --What do you expect from this agreement?, V. Yermakov was 
asked. 
  --Ukraine's main foreign economic partner is the Russian 
Federation. Therefore the absence of an agreement as to the 
regulation of processes that take place at consumer markets, 
problems connected with mutual supply of goods, and the 
guarantee of their quality and other issues, did not allow 
consumers of both countries to fully realize their rights with 
respect to legislation in force in Ukraine and Russia. There are 
such agreements now. The time has come to work out the 
mechanics, so that the agreement would work for the people. We 
think that the acceptance of the agreement will help to improve 
the situation in the consumer market of Ukraine and Russia, 
answered V. Yermakov. 
  Well, we expect that now we will not be denied, let us say, 
service, repair or return of highly complex domestic technology 
on the grounds that it is made in Russia, and they will not 
ignore us when we complain about the poor quality of goods made 
in a neighboring country. 
  To the point, in agreements for active trade cooperation 
between member countries of CIS, the problem of protection of 
consumer rights against poor quality products, which the partner 
countries are supplying, takes on a particular concreteness. 
Russia has made similar agreements with the Kirghiz Republic and 
preparatory work is being carried out with the Kazakhstan 
Republic. Of course, Ukraine also will not be limited by its 
agreement with Russia. Because it is necessary to protect the 
consumer in the whole economic expanse of the member countries 
of the commonwealth. For now there is an agreement only with 
Russia. But the main thing is that it work. If, of course the 
sides which reached an agreement, are not bounded by 
declarations, but develop positive mechanisms for our protection 
and in their compromises between producers and consumers do not 
forget the basic rule: the consumer is always right.

Why In Moscow They Like Nizhen Cucumbers, While in Ukraine They 
Rail Against High Prices"] 
  [Text] Two great ills have come home to roost in Ukraine: 
low wages and high prices. If minimal or average wages in Russia 
and Ukraine are compared at market rates of exchange, then the 
difference will be five, or even ten times to the benefit of 
Russia. Thus Ukrainians, more often than not, highly qualified 
specialists, searching for work go to Russia. But in Russia the 
food situation is more difficult, with food prices being four to 
five times higher than in Ukraine. That is why all who are not 
lazy buy products in Ukrainian stores and transport them en 
masse to Russia. They transport them by train, by airplane, by 
truck, and by passenger cars. 
  The peasants, who earlier usually transported into Russia 
early vegetables, fruits, and berries into Russia joining in 
this parcel business in large numbers. Currently they transport 
whatever they happen to have: potatoes, cabbage, beets, carrots, 
and home preserved vegetables and fruits. And other items as 
well. Here is how it works. 
  Tourist bureaus for such "tourism" have converted passenger 
buses to freight-passenger buses. Eight to ten people jointly 
rent such a bus, each takes about ten or eleven sacks of 
vegetables. At Moscow markets potatoes cost not less than 400 
rubles per kilogram, and cabbage, carrots, and beets are 
purchased at 700 rubles per kilogram, most expensive are pickled 
cucumbers - at two to two and a half thousand per kilogram. 
After converting prices from rubles to karbovanets, the price is 
four to five times higher than, say, in Kiev. But the cost of 
doing such business is not small. For transportation services 
everyone pays close to one and a half million into the account 
of the transport enterprise, and half again as much goes 
directly to the driver. For bus parking, for a place at the 
bazaar, bribes to the transport inspectors along the way - all 
these are additional costs. These costs consume over a third of 
the profits, but even so, in the end it turns out that each 
"tourist" traded for two million more than if he had sold his 
goods at home. 
  Now let us consider somewhat what this semi-domestic 
business 
means. 
  The fact that produce prices are four times lower does not 
at 
all signify that there is an overproduction of foodstuffs and a 
low production cost but first and foremost is indicative of the 
low purchasing power of the people. That is, what is being 
exported is what "I would eat myself - but I need the money." 
But the money earned in Moscow for the produce, as we can see 
even from the example of the commercial bus trip, does not come 
back to the producer. The lion's share is spent on all sorts of 
taxes. In that case how are the production costs recovered, 
especially for the production of the produce which is purchased 
in the stores? It is a good time mention the trillions in 
subsidies and non repayable credits which are allocated almost 
directly from the government's budget to the village. Not only 
foodstuffs are subsidized from the state budget but other goods 
in wide demand. 
  We amicably scold the government, which cannot contain 
prices, and which little considers that low prices for goods and 
services in the final analysis means low wages. Low wages, in 
turn, contribute to the reduction of the purchasing power and 
consequently a reduction in production. And until this vicious 
cycle in broken and until prices for goods and wages (because 
wages are nothing but the price of labor) do not approach world 
prices, then both goods and the labor force will be exported out 
of Ukraine. 
  But these are measures from the arsenal of healing therapy, 
So far, Ukrainian politicians are experimenting with the arsenal 
of shock therapy.

"Leonid Kuchma Gets Air Time on Ostankino. Is It Better To 
Conduct a Ukrainian Election Campaign in Russia?"] 
  [Text] Last Sunday, viewers of television Channel 1 could 
have seen two leaders of the unions of industrialists: the 
Russian Arkadiy Volskiy and Ukrainian Leonid Kuchma appearing on 
a program called "Dialogue on the Air," whose guests as a rule 
are heads of new independent states and other formations on the 
territory of the former Soviet Union. Even though the organizers 
of the program repeatedly stressed that it is in no way 
connected with the presidential campaign currently under way in 
Ukraine, it was clear that Leonid Kuchma had acquired a 
brilliant opportunity to present his program appealing to an 
audience far broader than that of the Ukrainian TV. 
  It is not necessary to be a prophet in order to predict that 
in the next several weeks Leonid Kuchma will be a frequent guest 
on Channel 1. In Moscow, it appears, they now believe that it is 
specifically this politician who is best disposed toward Russia, 
the most tractable, and the most susceptible to pressure 
compared with other presidential candidates, and mainly compared 
with the present head of the Ukrainian state Leonid Kravchuk and 
the reformist economist Vladimir Lanovyy. This means that air 
time on Ostankino must become that sail which will accelerate 
the presidential campaign ship of the retired prime minister. 
This approach, however, also incorporates a serious political 
error. For Ukraine, television Channel 1 is a program coming 
from an alien territory and often, how would it be possible to 
say this gently, it is, if not discredited, at least received 
with some slight irony by consumers of political information. 
Naturally, the "Ostankino effect" was very well reflected in the 
results of the referendum on independence. There was a no more 
systematic critic of that decision than the TV liberated from 
party control, and the result? Therefore, in order to ensure the 
victory of Leonid Kravchuk at the polls, it is simply necessary 
to curse him more frequently on Ostankino TV and praise Leonid 
Kuchma more often. Even though true followers of the former 
prime minister will hardly be scared off by that. 
  Getting the possibility of presenting his program to an 
audience of millions, Kuchma, however, did not reveal the 
existence of such a program. For almost a year he repeated the 
same formula: An economic union with Russia is necessary. He 
condemned Ukrainian leadership for isolationism, as if 
forgetting that it was specifically he who failed to achieve any 
real agreement with either Gaydar or Chernomyrdin. The reason 
for that, naturally, is not any personal lack of desire to reach 
agreement with the Russians, but the unwillingness of the former 
prime minister and the military-industrial, lobby which brought 
him to the summit of power, to reform the Ukrainian economy. It 
was under Kuchma that Russia, simply speaking, had nothing to 
talk about with Ukraine. The appearance of Kuchma on the 
television screen in the company of Arkadiy Volskiy, a respected 
politician who proposed for Russia specifically that path which 
was used "to reform" the Ukrainian economy, who was still not 
supported by the voters, demonstrated that one must not expect 
reforms should Leonid Kuchma regain power. In that case, what 
occurs? Economic union with Russia? But using what formula? The 
Belarus one does not appeal to Kuchma: "Nothing is working out 
for us with regard to them," he confessed in a disappointed way. 
All of the other formulas turn out to be strictly declarative. 
Who but Leonid Kuchma himself, who in the final days of his 
tenure travelled almost incognito to see Viktor Chernomyrdin 
with a request for help and was not understood in Moscow, could 
explain that better than others to Leonid Kuchma? 
  Nevertheless, Kuchma actually did reveal his principal aim 
in 
the TV appearance, beside the illusory economic union. 
Preservation of big industry, indicating a lack of understanding 
of objective laws of economic reforms in favoring such 
preservation, which was noted even by the television 
viewers--that was expressed and belabored by the long-term party 
secretary of the famous Yuzhmash. There is little doubt that if 
he is elected president, Leonid Kuchma will preserve that 
industry at any cost. 
  But what will happen to Ukraine?

<F P=106> [Article by Nikita Kirichenko, Anastasiya Matveyeva, </F>
Aleksandr Privalov and Andrey Shmarov: "These Edicts Have a 
Place in the Package"] 
  [Text] At the very beginning of last week, on Monday, Boris 
Yeltsin frankly and impartially qualified the state of the 
Russian economy as catastrophic. This declaration would have 
seemed quite penetrating -- now you cannot affect anyone with 
stronger expressions --if the president had not added that, as a 
counterbalance to the economic catastrophe, he had signed a 
package of six edicts on economic matters. At first, it spread 
quickly that the edicts abolished all restrictions on foreign 
trade. At the same time, rumors spread just as quickly that the 
edicts imposed restrictions on an increase in the enterprises' 
consumption fund and the issuing of cash. Due to these rumors, 
the dollar's cash exchange rate rose at once by 20 points. 
  As far as the complete liberalization of VED [foreign 
economic activities] goes, this was not confirmed. As for the 
cash -- this was confirmed. 
<H5>  The Abolition of Export Quotas and Licenses </H5>
  The president's Edict on the Abolition of Quota-Setting and 
Licensing for Deliveries of Good and Services for Export was 
signed exactly a week after the Minyust [Ministry of Justice] 
had registered the MVES' [Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations] order approving the instructions on the procedure for 
that same quota-setting and licensing. 
  The KOMMERSANT correspondents interested in this incident 
were unable to uncover the persons responsible for promulgating 
the edict (except for the president himself, of course). The 
head of the president's group of experts, Aleksandr Livshits, 
stated that his subdivision did not participate directly in the 
edict's drafting. The government staff informed us that they had 
read the edict for the first time in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. The 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations' reaction was reflected 
in the perplexed statement of the chief of the Export-Import 
Operations for State Needs Main Administration, Andrey Dogayev: 
"I would like to hope that all the consequences of this 
document's adoption have been thoroughly studied and accepted 
after consultations with the sectorial ministries and the 
regional administrations. It would be undesirable to have a 
repetition of the situation which arose with the adoption of the 
new import customs tariff." In the Minekonomiki [Ministry of 
Economics], the specialist sought could not be found, but, after 
talking things over, KOMMERSANT's experts came to the conclusion 
that Mr. Shokhin's department does not issue such crude 
documents. 
  And, in fact, the edict does not wear the crown of a 
bureaucratic creation. It consists of only two points, but they 
contain so many obscurities and contradictions that the drafting 
of the package of its supplementing documents will require 
serious and skilled work. 
  The questions begin right with the edict's first point. It 
says that quota-setting and licensing shall be maintained for 
goods and services "to be exported in accordance with the 
Russian Federation's [RF] international obligations." In the 
opinion of the deputy chief of the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations' Export-Import Operations for State Needs Main 
Administration, Mikhail Gaykazov, this makes it possible to 
interpret it as an indication of the fact that the talk is about 
goods to be shipped to other countries in accordance with 
intergovernmental agreements. But it is most likely that this is 
not so. As it seems to the experts, the non-tariff regulation of 
export shipments, according to the logic of Russia's relations 
with the YeS [European Union -- EU] and the MVF [International 
Monetary Fund -- IMF], was supposed to be maintained only with 
respect to those goods which have quotas set by agreements only 
with these organizations. 
  Further, in the first point, astonishment is being evoked 
among knowledgeable people by the fact that the quota-setting 
and licensing have merged here, as it were, into a single whole, 
which, however, is also not surprising for the average citizen 
stupefied from the mass of new economic terms. At the same time, 
these are "two big differences." And the one thing may well 
exist separately from the other. 
  Quota-setting is an attempt to reserve for the treasury the 
guaranteed receipt of money through the sale of export quotas. 
Under current market conditions, this source has begun to dry 
up. This is why an attempt is being made to plug the holes in 
the budget, by abolishing certain export preferences. 
  However, export licensing is a means of ensuring the state's 
strategic interests. It is used as a lever for state regulation 
of foreign economic activities throughout the entire country, 
even with the most liberal approach to the economy. So that, to 
abolish licensing and to say that this is very liberal, is 
somewhat strange. 
  KOMMERSANT's experts decline to make long commentaries with 
respect to the edict's second point because of its complete 
internal contradictoriness. They suggest that the government 
"abolish preferences for the exporting of goods and services for 
federal state needs (except for goods to be exported to the 
countries of the near abroad in accordance with 
intergovernmental agreements), with the exception of preferences 
granted in accordance with the RF Law on the Customs Tariff...." 
But this law contains one small point, according to which it is 
precisely these preferences which the government is granting. 
  Finally, it is symptomatic that the edict passes over in 
silence the special exporters -- and thereby preserves their 
right to exist. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations 
explains the necessity of maintaining the institution of special 
exporters by the fact that, with their help, it is easier to 
maintain prices at the highest possible level, not letting them 
drop to the level of dumping prices, and also to exercise 
control over the repatriation of currency earnings. The next 
logical step on this path is a further reduction in the number 
of special exporters: after all, it is easier to control one 
than several. 
<H5>  Taxes and Cash </H5>
  The subject of taxes is, in any event, no less confused than 
the preceding one. Part of this subject can be interpreted two 
ways, part looks too declarative and part is simply 
incomprehensible. However, there are also rational kernels. 
  The first thing which is incomprehensible is the most 
important: by how much, actually, is it being proposed that 
taxes be reduced? If the text of the Edict on Certain Matters of 
the Tax Policy is interpreted literally, then it follows from it 
that it is being proposed that the rates for the NDS 
[Value-Added Tax -- VAT] and the profits tax be lowered by 10-20 
percent. Ten percent of the current VAT rate (including the 
special tax) is 2.3 percentage points and it is 3.8 points for 
the maximum rate for the profits tax. Thus, the president's 
proposal can be reduced to bringing the corresponding rates down 
to 20.7 percent (the VAT) and 34.2 percent (the profits tax). 
This is undoubtedly pleasing, however, strictly speaking of 
course, this is ridiculously small: all the same, the granted 
break assumes rates higher than last year's. 
  Also vague is the budget at the expense of which the profits 
tax will be reduced -- the federal or the municipal. And such 
confusion may cause very serious squabbles among the fiscal 
organs. 
  Moreover, upon closer examination, even this benefit may be 
eaten away -- through an increase in the norms for other taxes. 
Indeed, it is recommended in the edict that the taxation of the 
citizens' personal incomes be increased, along with the taxes on 
the property of the public and legal persons. 
  But the president could also have made a slip, having in 
mind 
a lowering of the rates not by percentages, but rather, by 
percentage points (a quite common slip of the 
tongue). And so then the edict's implementation may exert a 
fairly serious normalizing influence on the investment climate. 
  In fact, let us take our reference investment plan (for 
details, see the investment review in KOMMERSANT No 17) and 
assume that the VAT is set at the level of 13 percent (minus 10 
percentage points), while the profits tax is set at the level of 
18 percent (minus 20 points). In this instance, the investment 
conditions change quite radically. 
  Let us recall the plan's basic features. The total amount of 
investments is 500 million rubles [R], the time from the 
investment of the money to the production of the first output is 
6 months, the number of workers is 201 persons (for the 
evaluation of the reference plan, interference in the form of 
preferences for small enterprises was not "applied"), the 
average wages are R300,000 per month, and the current return on 
capital is 40 percent (which corresponds approximately to the 
industry average). 
  Calculations indicate that, under the existing tax 
conditions, the pay-back period for this plan comes to 17 
months, the internal profit norm (the indicator which 
characterizes the maximum value of the resources which can be 
used for the plan's realization) is 739 percent and the 
investments' profitability (over the life of the plan) is 92 
percent. 
  If the taxes are lowered by 3-4 percent (the literal 
interpretation of the president's edict), then the pay-back 
period decreases to 14 months, the internal profit norm 
increases to 769 percent and the investments' profitability 
increases to 120 percent.

  However, with a radical lowering of the basic taxes, the 
pay-back period decreases to 12 months, the internal profit norm 
increases to 986 percent and the investments' profitability 
increases to 245 percent (see Table 1). It may be noted that, 
while the reduction of the profits tax affects mainly such 
indicators of efficiency as the investments' profitability and 
the internal profit norm (see Chart 1), the decrease in the VAT 
is reflected first of all in the lowering of the current demand 
for working capital (see Chart 2). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-069-06A>      Chart 1. The Investments' Profitability in Relation </FIG>



  &lt;annot&gt; Key: -- 1. Left-Hand Column: the Investments' 
Profitability as a Percentage -- 2. Bottom Row: Profits Tax Rate 
as a Percentage&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The effect, as we see, is considerable. However, it is 
unfortunate that, even if the president had percentage points in 
mind, then, in this instance as well, even a good undertaking 
may fall through. The Duma may block it -- for quite 
understandable fiscal reasons. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-069-06B>      Chart 2. Increase in the Demand for Working Capital </FIG>



  &lt;annot&gt; Key: -- 1. Left-Hand Column: Millions of Rubles 
--2. Bottom Row: Number of Months --3. Lines Represent the VAT 
at Various Rates&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  It is true that, in this instance, the administration has 
some kind of counterplay. A hint of this is contained in the tax 
edict: the talk is about accelerated depreciation, the mechanism 
of which the government is instructed to develop over the course 
of 2 months. Accelerated depreciation is good, first, because it 
makes it possible to reduce profit and, correspondingly, the tax 
payments, thereby improving the investment situation (see Table 
1) and, second, because its use does not require legislative 
formalization. It is true that what is being talked about in the 
edict is accelerated depreciation in the high-technology 
sectors, but who will interfere in the event that this mechanism 
is applied to other industries? 
  We would note, however, that our scenario for the "good" (in 
the sense of investment stimulation) version of the edict, as it 
were, leaves outside the framework the budget result of the 
easing of the tax climate. And this is hardly proper. It is 
possible, of course, to argues idealistically about the 
unrestrained growth of business activity and the increase in the 
tax base, which would follow this easing, which would make it 
possible to cover the tax arrears. But, to be honest, even if 
this occurs, it will not be right away by any means. 
  This is why the budget effect, both for the Duma and for the 
president's economic experts, is far from being the last thing. 
And it must be noted that the drafters of the package of edicts 
understand this. 
  They also understand the fact that simply introducing new 
taxes and raising the rates will not solve the old problems. 
Thus, it is necessary to do a better job of collecting the 
already existing taxes. This circumstance has been taken into 
consideration in other edicts from the package -- the Edict on 
Additional Measures for Normalization of Settlements and 
Strengthening Payment Discipline in the National Economy and the 
Edict on the Implementation of Integrated Measures for the 
Timely and Complete Submission to the Budget of Taxes and Other 
Obligatory Payments. 
  These documents contain quite a few repeats of already 
existing norms or variations on their theme (for example, 
regarding the ban on the opening of several current accounts), 
which have been invoked, apparently, to demonstrate the 
seriousness of the authorities' intentions. But there are also 
new restrictions. The talk, first of all, is about the tax 
organs' right to withdraw funds without authorization from 
enterprises' currency accounts using the procedure for paying 
off arrears in obligatory payments (in essence, this point 
legitimizes already available TsB [Central Bank] and Minfin 
[Ministry of Finance] instructions on this matter), as well as 
about introducing a procedure for prioritization in the use of 
funds from a current account. 
  At the same time, if, in the first instance, the interests 
of 
primarily exporters are affected, especially of those not 
burning with a yearning to run and to pay taxes, then the second 
circumstance is nothing new and it affects absolutely all 
managing entities and does so very seriously. 
  And, really, about what does the Edict on Additional 
Measures 
for Normalization of Settlements... talk? It directs that all 
legal persons may obtain cash in a bank "... in an amount not 
exceeding 5 percent of the average daily receipts of funds into 
their current accounts for the preceding quarter, including for 
the payment of wages... -- in the amount of 5 times the minimum 
monthly wage, proceeding on the basis of the overall average 
listed number of workers." 
  So, if you please: they thereby twisted the "dough" if not 
into a ram's horn, then very tightly. Indeed, as it turned out 
-- previously, the servicing bank issued exactly as much cash as 
was requested and it was the client's business to handle this 
cash in such a way that the controlling organs did not catch on 
and did not qualify it as personal income payments. There were 
lots of ways to do this -- from the old "for purchasing 
agricultural products" to payments to their own associates for 
leasing their motor vehicles and purchasing vouchers at a high 
price and selling them at a low price. Now, however, the 
enterprises' money circulation plans have been frozen. 
  Of course, it is possible to obtain cash due, but only by 
transferring money to personal accounts. But this means that it 
is necessary to give instructions to the bank with an 
explanation of the purposes and, naturally, to whom the money is 
being transferred, i.e., strictly speaking, to illuminate for 
the tax inspectorate not only one's own bookkeeping, but also 
the bank's. 
  Of course, there also remain such old tried and true methods 
as the use for money laundering of partners who have a business 
involving "dough" such as, for example, retail sales. However, 
this channel will work only as long as their use of cash 
registers remains uncontrolled. If they are forced to use the 
cash registers all the same, then then stream of "dough" will 
momentarily dry up. In the latter event, reliable money 
laundering will be possible, very likely, only through offshore 
companies. 
<H5>  A Public House -- Sad Words </H5>
  The Edict on the Reform of State Enterprises, which is also 
part of the package under examination by us, has been called 
into being by lamentable circumstances. Apparently, it signifies 
by itself the overdue start of the government's long-promised 
campaign for the restoration of the manageability of state 
property. It must be acknowledged that the grounds for the 
start of such a campaign are more than adequate. Over the last 
few years, the press has been overflowing with proof of the fact 
that the management of the vast majority of state enterprises 
uses them as its own private domains, without hardly a glance at 
their nominal owner, the state. The current managers of the 
state enterprises are enjoying all the rights of an owner, 
without being burdened by an owner's responsibility -- and, on 
the other hand, also not burdened by any other external 
responsibility. 
  The edict, about which we have been talking, will begin to 
restrict these managerial freebooters. Let us present its 
contents in brief. As of the moment of the edict's promulgation, 
it stops the establishment of new federal enterprises with the 
allocation to them of property based on the right of complete 
economic authority. Some of the currently existing federal 
enterprises will be eliminated -- and public plants, 
factories or industries will be established on their basis. It 
is clear from the edict's text that this action should be 
considered a punishment: considered as grounds for making such a 
decision will be the lack of profit based on the results of the 
last 2 years, the indiscriminate use of allocated federal 
credits or the "improper" use of real property -- in other 
words, the inept or illegal management of an enterprise. Just 
what does the punishment consist of? How will a "public" 
enterprise differ from a state enterprise? 
  Property will be allocated to it not based on the right of 
complete economic authority, but rather, on the right of 
operational management, i.e., it will be able to implement the 
alienation, leasing or pledging of this property only by the 
consent of the government or an organ empowered by it. A reader 
of the edict will have a doubt: does a current state enterprise 
really have the right, for example, to lease its capacities 
without the approval of the GKI [State Committee for State 
Property Management]? Indeed, it does not. Thus, does the edict 
not declare that it is the duty of the "public" enterprises 
simply to observe the obligatory laws a bit more strictly than 
everyone observes them? Let us read on -- the suspicion gets 
stronger. 
  Specified in the charter of a public enterprise is the 
personal responsibility of the manager for the results of 
economic activities --but really, is there nothing at all 
mentioned in the current contracts with the managers of state 
enterprises about responsibility for results? A public 
enterprise will be obligated to use federal credits for a 
specific purpose -- but is a current state enterprise also 
really not so obligated in the least? 
  The only, perhaps, substantial harsh item in the edict is 
this: the procedure for distributing profits will be fixed in 
the public enterprise's charter. Although, if you think about 
it, even here there is nothing to be especially feared: first, 
what difference does it make how profits are distributed, if 
there have not been any for 2 years all the same; second, it 
depends on which procedure will be fixed.... 
  The newspapers have already managed to inform us that many 
state enterprise managers are inclined to view the change into a 
number of public plants not as a punishment, but rather, as a 
long-desired goal. Our cursory perusal of the edict, it would 
seem, confirmed these managers' opinion: there is seemingly 
nothing terrible in the title "public" and you do come under the 
wing of the budget all the same. But this is only at first 
glance. But read more attentively -- you will see that the 
public plants have not been promised any kind of special 
protection. 
  Judge for yourself. That a public plant is obligated to use 
federal funds for a specific purpose is stated in black and 
white, but that these funds will be allocated in any adequate 
amount is not stated even between the lines. That a public plant 
is not allowed to obtain credits without government guarantees 
is stated, but that the government intends to grant such 
guarantees is never mentioned. But if a public plant does not 
use any part of the property entrusted to it for operational 
management or uses it other than as intended, then the 
government will take the afore-mentioned property away from it. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-069-08A>      Chart 3. Structure of the Consolidated Budget's Revenues in the First Quarter of 1994 </FIG>



  So, for an enterprise, the treasury's guardianship will turn 
out most likely to be more of a hindrance than a substantial 
help. And, for far-sighted managers, now is the time to take 
advantage of the loophole left in the edict: according to the 
last paragraph of point 4, a decision about converting to public 
enterprises "may not be made with respect to a federal state 
enterprise which has not been prohibited from privatizing by the 
State Privatization Program... and which has submitted using the 
established procedure, prior to 1 July 1994, an application for 
privatization." Hurry, gentlemen, submit the applications! The 
train is departing! 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-069-08B>      Chart 4. Receipt of Revenues into the Federal and </FIG>



  &lt;annot&gt; Key: -- 1. Left Side: Federal Budget -- 2. Right 
Side: Local Budget -- 3. Profits Tax -- 4. VAT -- 5. Income Tax 
from Natural Persons -- 6. Excise Taxes -- 7. Revenues from 
Foreign Economic Activities&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  On the other hand, it is possible that we are hasty with our 
conclusions. It is necessary to wait a month or two -- and it 
will become clear to everyone whether the changing of 
enterprises from state ones to public ones is a reward or a 
punishment. Prior to 1 July 1994, the government will approve a 
Model Charter for a public plant (factory or industry) and, 
prior to 1 August, it will determine the "procedure for the 
planning (finally! -- KOMMERSANT) and financing of public plants 
(factories or industries), including for the maintenance of 
social-sphere facilities allocated to them, for the setting of 
prices for the goods (work or services) produced by them and for 
their budget financing, as well as the wages for their workers." 
So let us read these documents and all doubts will disappear and 
everyone will find out at the same time just what the "planning 
of plants" means. 
  KOMMERSANT's experts, however, are ready to state their own 
assumptions even now. It seems to us that the only real 
assistance to the public plants on the part of the treasury will 
be just the maintenance of the plants' allocated social, 
cultural and communal facilities: after all, if the plants, 
especially those which form cities, go bankrupt (you will 
remember -- 2 years without profits), then the budget will have 
no choice -- it will maintain the orphaned social, cultural and 
communal facilities by whatever means are necessary. As for all 
the rest, there will be plenty of planning and more than enough 
price-setting, but there will be no financing to speak of. 
  To console the reader, however, let us make one more 
assumption: if this edict works at all, it will do so very, very 
slowly. Why? Because this happy moment is absolutely supposed to 
be preceded by the approval of the list of 
enterprises subject to change into public ones. And our 
government has a very hard time producing this genre -- the 
lists. We would remind you that the lists of VPK 
[Military-Industrial Complex] enterprises prohibited from being 
privatized (and those lists were, to a certain extent, similar 
to this one) took 9 months to prepare, instead of the 3 months 
prescribed by the presidential edict. But the lists of future 
bankruptcies are being prepared continuously -- there is no end 
in sight. Consequently, we will have to wait and wait for the 
list of potential public plants --indeed, even the deadline for 
their drafting has not been set by the edict. 
<H5>  The Adventures of the Highway Fund </H5>
  Undoubtedly, Edict No 1008, On the RF Federal Highway Fund, 
occupies a special place in the package of presidential edicts 
by virtue of its reformatory incandescence and the sharpness of 
its statements. 
  Without lapsing into needless pathos, it must be said that, 
since the beginning of 1992, the uneasy fate of the RF Federal 
Highway Fund has been linked partly to the fate of the RF itself 
and its reformatory thinking. Following its great Motherland, 
the Federal Highway Fund has endured the periods of birth, 
legislative formalization, amendments to the latter, 
consolidation and, finally, a separate article. 
  Let us explain what we are talking about. At the beginning 
of 
1992, when the main task for Gaydar's government was to show to 
the arbiters from the IMF a state budget with an acceptable 
deficit, the highway fund, along with its entire deficit, was 
isolated as a separate industry. The old taxes from motor 
vehicle owners (50 kopecks per unit of an engine's horsepower) 
simply could not cover the budget expenditures for road 
maintenance and repair. 
  When the fund became independent, they began to see to its 
revenue portion. For example, a fee was imposed on legal persons 
when a motor vehicle was purchased. Thus, the fund even began to 
prosper, while Boris Fedorov did not note this at the end of 
1993. 
  The funds assets were immediately "consolidated" into the 
budget. However, inasmuch as the last thing Boris Fedorov wanted 
was to spend the money for road maintenance and repair, the 
special-purpose fund stopped being a special-purpose one. 
However, just a very little bit of time passed and everything 
became fine again: the new stage of reform "from above" 
determined that the fund's place is in the budget, but as a 
"separate article." 
  Thus, KOMMERSANT's experts have carefully read in 
succession all six edicts of the presidential package. It is 
precisely the recognition of these diverse documents as a 
package which makes it possible to assess the entire extent of 
the disparity between the authorities' reformatory potential and 
the catastrophic state of the economy declared by the president 
himself. To reach the one reasonable, even if vaguely worded, 
idea on the restriction of illegal "dough," it is necessary in 
this package to wade through a pile of bureaucratic twaddle 
which is burdened by a claim to profundity. 
  The continuation of the series of presidential edicts 
has been promised. Perhaps they will compel us to change our 
opinion about the entire "new wave of reforms" -- but certainly 
not about the first six drops.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Goryachev, chief of the GosNII GA [State </F>
Civil Aviation Scientific Research Institute] and doctor of 
tchnical sciences, and I. Samoylov, chief of a division and 
candidate of technical sciences: "What Kind of Aircraft Will We 
Be Flying?"] 
  [Text] Civil aviation is going through difficult times in 
Russia today. The principal indicator of this is the decline in 
the volume of air service on domestic routes. However, according 
to predictions by specialists, stabilization of the effective 
demand for air transport should take place by the end of 1995, 
after which it is expected to increase at the rate of about 6 
percent annually. The 1992 level may be reached by the year 
2000. With respect to the more distant future, the requirements 
for air transport in 2010 may reach 200 to 230 billion 
passenger-kilometers, that is, they will exceed the highest 
level of 1990 (159 billion passenger-kilometers). 
  Naturally, the question arises whether it will be possible 
to 
meet the effective demand for air service with the fleet of 
airplanes and helicopters that is available. Analysis shows that 
roughly by the beginning of 1998, airlines will not be able to 
cope with the transportation volume unless they undertake 
substantial renovation of their fleet of aircraft. 
  However, this is not a simple process, as we know. It 
requires sizable material outlays, which far from all air 
carriers can afford. For this reason, one of the conditions for 
survival of the sector in recent years has been solution of the 
problem of maintenance on the airplanes and helicopters in 
operation. The State Civil Aviation Scientific Research 
Institute has conducted a great deal of work, as the result of 
which the service life of Il-62M, Tu-154B, and Tu-134A airplanes 
and Mi-2 and Mi-8 helicopters has been extended. Some 490 
million rubles [R] were spent on this work, producing an 
efficiency valued at R118 billion. If this work had not been 
conducted, 11 percent fewer Il-62M, 7 percent fewer Tu-154B, and 
42.5 percent fewer Tu-134A aircraft would have been operating on 
air routes in 1994. 
  Nevertheless, the problem of replacing obsolete aircraft 
with 
new ones has not lost its urgency. Resolving it means 
maintaining the competitiveness of domestic airlines not only in 
the world air service market, but the domestic market as well. 
  What does our fleet of civil aircraft consist of today? 
Roughly 1,650 mainline aircraft. At the same time, 80 percent of 
mainline routes are being served by aircraft which are operating 
beyond the limits of their initially assigned service life. By 
1996 we will have to write off 12 to 15 percent of the mainline 
aircraft, and by the year 2000, more than half of them. Some 20 
percent of mainline flights are made in "modern" Il-86, Yak-42, 
and Tu-154M aircraft which have been in operation for over 10 
years and have become outdated. 
  Our fleet of aircraft includes several thousand airplanes 
for 
local air routes, the overwhelming majority of which are An-2's. 
There are 2,100 helicopters, 97 percent of which are obsolete 
Mi-8's and Mi-2's. 
  The serviceability of the aircraft is not up to standards. 
For example, the degree of serviceability of the fleet of Il-86 
aircraft is 56 percent, whereas the norm is 66 percent. The 
annual flying time of one mainline aiurcraft is no more than an 
average of 2,000 hours. The best of the aircraft on local 
routes--the L-410 and An-28--are actually idle because they lack 
spare parts. 
  So in this state of affairs, the answer to the question of 
whether or not we need to update our domestic fleet of aircraft 
is unequivocal. And the renovation has already begun. We can 
even name a speific date--14 July 1993, when the Il-96-300 made 
its first scheduled flight. But the renovation process was begun 
roughly 5 years late... 
  The principal types of airplanes and helicopters which 
should 
replace the obsolete aircraft have been more or less determined. 
They include the long-range mainline aircraft--the Il-96-300 and 
its modifications, the Tu-204-300D, and in the more distant 
future, the Il-96-200 and the Tu-304; the medium-range mainline 
aircraft--the Tu-204 and its modifications and the An-218; and 
the short-range mainline aircraft--the Tu-334-100, Il-114M, and 
Yak-242. In the cargo aircraft class, they include new 
modifications of the Il-76, the An-70T or Tu-330, the 
5-metric-ton MiG-110 or the Tu-130, and cargo versions of the 
Il-96, Tu-204, and Il-114. 
  In the near future, the Il-114 and its modifications, the 
An-38, or the Be-32 will be available for local air routes. 
Later on a new type of aircraft may make its appearance--a 
regional 40- to 50-seat aircraft with a turbojet engine which 
will take its place between the much slower Il-114 and the much 
more spacious Tu-334 on routes of up to 2,500 kilometers with 
relatively low passenger flows. We are linking development of 
the helicopter fleet with the appearance of helicopters such as 
the Mi-38, Mi-34VAZ, Mi-26K, Mi-54, and Ka-62. 
  The objective requirements to update Russian airlines' fleet 
of aircraft as a whole are so great that it is hard to say which 
classes of new airplanes and helicopters may turn out to be 
unnecessary and may not find their place in this market. At 
present, there are design proposals for dozens of new aircraft 
for business flights, general aviation, and various classes of 
load-carrying capacity. 
  But this is a potential market. The real market is 
determined 
not so much by an objective requirement as by actual effective 
demand. In order to characterize this market, we will cite 
several figures. In 1993 the various airlines and enterprises in 
Russia purchased 182 new aircraft: 71 airplanes and 111 
helicopters for a total of more than R250 billion. State 
investments account for a little more than 10 percent of this 
sum, and the funds of enterprises and local financing sources 
account for the remainder. Some 60 percent of all airplanes and 
helicopters, including 12 Tu-154M aircraft, were acquired by 
nonstate enterprises for operation, leasing, and resale. 
  At the same time, many state airlines do not have enough 
money to obtain their own aircraft after repair. At the end of 
1993, 50 airplanes and 80 helicopters were in repair plants. 
They had been repaired, but were not redeemed: the airlines owe 
a total of R12 billion to the repair plants. 
  The appearance this year of aircraft manufactured in the 
West, the Boeing 737 in particular, is a very important factor. 
It attests to the beginning of a fundamentally new stage in th 
development of Russian civil aviation--real competition between 
domestic and foreign aircraft in the domestic market. And this 
ought to be viewed very seriously. 
  The point is that the prices of aircraft being turned out by 
Russian plants are already close to those being asked for 
Western aircraft which have been in use. For example, in June 
1993, the price of a Tu-154M was about R3 billion. Today it is 
over R6 billion. At the same time, according to the Western 
press, more than eight or 10 DC-9 aircraft of various 
modifications which were formerly in use were offered for sale 
or lease in July and August 1993 from 750,000 U.S. dollars 
(DC-98-10-20)[sic; presumably figure should be "9," not "98"] to 
$6.2 million (DC-9-50), that is, an average of $2 million to $3 
million. At that time, when the average monthly lease was about 
1 percent of the price of the aircraft, airlines would have paid 
$20,000 to $30,000 per month for a lease. Raising this by a 
factor of 1.5 to take into account the expenses for spare parts, 
inasmuch as the aircraft are not new, we obtain $30,000 to 
$45,000 per month. With the existing rates for passenger and 
cargo services, operation of these aircraft with a profitability 
level of up to 30 percent is entirely realistic. And their 
advantages in fuel efficiency (25 grams per passenger-kilometer, 
compared with 30 grams per passenger-kilometer for the most 
economical domestic aircraft, the Tu-154M), reliability, the 
opportunity to fly 6 to 10 hours per day, the organized system 
of technical support, and so forth make these aircraft very 
attractive for Russian airlines. Operation of the DC-9 aircraft 
also opens the way for newer and more advanced aircraft of the 
MD-91 (82-88) type, which are now being offered at $15 million 
to $24 million. 
  The new nature of the aircraft market also determines the 
new 
emphasis on technical and economic requirements for Russian 
aircraft and the relationships between buyers and sellers. 
  High fuel efficiency continues to be the principle 
requirement for new aircraft at present, inasmuch as it makes it 
possible to substantially reduce expenses for aviation fuel, 
both in absolute and comparative measurement. 
  The next most important requirements are reliability and 
safety, the service life, and the efficiency of ways and means 
of monitoring the condition of the aircraft in operation, 
inasmuch as this combination of characteristics determines the 
ability to reach a high level in the turnover rate of financial 
resources and in prevention of potential losses in aircraft 
accidents and incidents. 
  Establishment of a system of after-sale support for an 
airline by the manufacturing plant is an important condition; 
this includes training of crews and technical personnel, 
providing the necessary equipment for technical maintenance 
bases, a steady supply of spare parts, and so forth. And a 
requirement that is even more important is an acceptable price 
and payment conditions. 
  All these requirements should be stipulated and coordinated 
in the contract for delivery of an airplane or helicopter. The 
contract should also provide for the economic responsibility of 
the supplier to the buyer for any loss to the latter as the 
result of failure to meet the requirements agreed upon, as well 
as an efficient system of arbitration or legal solution to 
conflicts. 
  The State Civil Aviation Scientific Research Institute 
considers its duty to provide for maximum possible efficiency in 
the process of updating the fleet of aircraft. To achieve this, 
the plans for its work include comprehensive studies on the 
certification of new airplanes and helicopters; the development 
of updated national aviation regulations, combined with the 
standards in effect in other countries; analysis of Russian 
airlines' requirements for new aircraft; study of the domestic 
market for the sale of aircraft manufacturers' output; and 
determination of the most efficient use of funds being allocated 
from the state budget to develop aviation equipment. In order to 
determine precisely what the requirements are for aviation 
equipment and the air carriers' requirement for one type of 
aircraft or another, the institute distributes specially 
developed questionnaires to aviation enterprises and airlines 
each year. It is very unfortunate that certain managers in local 
areas are in no hurry to respond. 
  Russian civil aviation is still a long way from a real 
market. But we have already familiarized ourselves with certain 
elements in a market economy and we realize: the market does not 
forgive blunders, it must be studied, and we need to prepare for 
it. So it turns out that the change in economic policy in the 
sector has coincided with another period of no less importance 
in its life: for replacing the obsolete equipment with new 
equipment. But there will be no directives from "the mighty 
person outside" today. By considering their own requirements and 
material capabilities, the airlines themselves will determine 
the types of aircraft, the number needed, and the conditions 
under which they may be obtained. By making the right choice, 
they not only strengthen their financial and economic activity, 
but they will be able to more fully meet the public's 
requirement for air service, and what is no less important, to 
impove the quality of these flights. But a mistake can cost them 
dearly. It is entirely possible that it may turn out to be their 
last one. Such are the laws of the market.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yegor Gaydar, director of the Institute for </F>
Economic Problems of the Transition Period, as reported by 
Yelena Vishnevskaya: "Will a Crash Delay the President's Sweep?"] 
  [Text] Being discussed in business circles are the 
possible consequences of the measures pouring out of the package 
of presidential edicts and governmental decrees. There are still 
a few documents pending. But what will be the effect of the 
already signed edicts? There have been quite a few skeptical and 
even deprecatory comments among opinions about the already 
promulgated edicts. But here is the opinion of the director of 
the Institute for Economic Problems of the Transition Period, 
Yegor Gaydar. 
  On the whole, they can only be welcomed. The decisions 
contained in them were discussed for a long time within the 
government and were the subject of fierce debate and opposition. 
Among the most serious decisions involving direct action, for 
which there are no legal obstacles in the way of their 
implementation, is the document on the liberalization of foreign 
economic activities and the abolition of quota-setting and 
licensing. This is a quite revolutionary decision. In my 
opinion, it had already become immanent at the end of 1993 and 
could have been implemented as of the beginning of this year. 
  Last fall, with enormous difficulty, we implemented the 
decision to reduce substantially the volumes of quota-restricted 
and licensed commodities. To be honest, I will not believe in 
this decision until I see it implemented in practice: I know 
only too well what serious groups of interests the abolition of 
quota-setting and licensing touches and what substantial 
opportunities for the mobilization of illegal revenues are 
associated in our country, just as in any country carrying out 
such a large-scale program, with these changed standard acts. 
  A substantial factor which prompted at this time the 
adoption 
of so radical a decision is the extreme impudence of many 
exporting sectors in the use of the breaks and privileges on 
export tariffs, which was displayed at the beginning of 1994. 
This matter has traditionally been the subject of 
haggling--export tariffs or centralized deliveries of fuel and 
energy resources? Over the course of all of 1993 there was 
constant discussion about what portion of the exportable gas or 
oil should go for the federal budget's needs. 
  The general plan was something like this: Around half of the 
exportable resources would be used for the budget's needs and 
then the other half would be exempt from the export tariffs. In 
1994 a paradoxical situation arose when the producers were 
exempted from the export tariffs and they considered it 
absolutely unnecessary to deliver products for budget 
requirements. As a result, the budget's revenues from foreign 
economic activities, toward an increase in which, to a large 
extent, the draft of the 1994 budget had been oriented, 
decreased sharply in the first half of the year. Then the urgent 
need arose to simplify all foreign economic activities and to 
abolish not only quotas and licenses, but also the export tariff 
breaks. If the decision is actually carried out, this will lead 
to an increase in export receipts. 
  The main obstacle in the way of the abolition of the quotas, 
let us say in the area of oil marketing, has traditionally been 
associated with actual transportation limitations on the volume 
of our exporting--the capacities of the pipelines and the major 
exporting ports. Actually, we are currently exporting 
approximately as much oil as our transportation can carry out of 
the country. I am convinced that this situation will continue in 
the near future--it is not a matter of quotas, rather of 
transportation. Although, of course, the abolition of the quotas 
and licenses, in principle, expands the opportunities for 
transportation enterprises to make the most of their own 
monopoly position. 
  But, all the same, there are advantages to having this kind 
of economic regulation in comparison with the administrative 
type. If, over the course of a certain amount of time, you have 
transportation capacities which act as actual limitations, 
sooner or later you will build a new oil-tanker seaport. But if 
you have administrative quotas and licenses, then the result 
will exclusively be an additional number of Mercedes. From this 
point of view, I think that this kind of decision will be 
beneficial to the long-term dynamics of Russia's foreign trade 
and the development of its fuel sector. If, of course, we 
actually manage to put it into practice. 
  There are also other decisions which are correct and long 
immanent, for example, consolidation of the highway fund into 
the budget. I would call the sharp tightening up of tax control 
one of the other especially significant ones. It is a very 
useful and outstanding decision! But it has one shortcoming: 
Unfortunately, it does not have any legal force. Until the 
appropriate law is adopted by the Duma and then by the Federal 
Assembly, not a single court will implement it. Unfortunately, I 
know this quite well from experience. 
  The same thing may be said about the decision to grant large 
breaks to joint production ventures, which contribute more than 
$10 million. This decision is contradictory and ambiguous in its 
consequences. But it cannot be implemented on the basis of 
presidential edicts within the framework of the existing 
constitution. This is more a declaration of intentions, which 
may have practical consequences in the event that it is backed 
up by appropriate legislation. Otherwise, this decision 
contradicts a whole set of laws. 
  As for the changes in the tax legislation, these are 
sensible 
proposals for reducing somewhat the rates for the profits tax, 
the value-added tax, and the deductions for social insurance 
while increasing the property taxes. 
  But, the personal income taxes as a second source, it seems 
to me, have been selected unsuccessfully. I absolutely do not 
believe in the feasibility and advisability of the upper rate 
for the income tax. I am convinced that, under the conditions of 
our lack of tradition of tax discipline, this decision will more 
likely lead to a decrease, rather than an increase, in actual 
tax receipts. I would more likely name as an obvious target an 
increase in the rates of the land tax as a perfectly natural 
direction for making up "falling" revenues. 
  The document on reforming state enterprises has been in 
preparation for a long time. It makes it possible to take one 
more step to eliminate the completely irregular situation when 
the directors of the state enterprises, within the framework of 
the concept introduced by us back at the end of the eighties of 
full economic management, received rights I usually compare with 
the rights of regimental commanders--to declare war, to conclude 
peace, and to sell off their regimental property with such 
obvious serious consequences for the national economy. Now it is 
possible to strengthen control over the state enterprises' work 
and to create incentives for their more or less normal behavior.

  [Signed] B.N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation 
  Moscow, the Kremlin 
  Draft presented by I. Kivelidi 
<H5>  Opinion </H5>
  Since this draft was sent out by Oleg Soskovets, first 
vice-premier of the government, for an evaluation by various 
authoritative specialists in this field, we are able to publish 
one of the comments. 
  To O.N. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Government 
of 
the Russian Federation 
  The country is choking in bureaucratic licentiousness. The 
attempt at a transition from the totalitarian economic system to 
the market system by means of the administration and command 
system embellished by democratic slogans has collapsed. 
  Millions of producers, as before, are not owners of their 
labor and its results. This labor and its results are 
appropriated by the bureaucratic system. The preservation of 
hired labor with the removal of surplus value makes any 
administrative foci of the type of organization of new federal 
state systems for the development of entrepreneurship senseless. 
This is an attempt to maintain, at the expense of the poor 
taxpayer, a huge army of idlers, who will definitively regulate 
the pitiful and ugly development of the free market. 
  The introduction of the capitalist system from above on the 
basis of the collectivization and industrialization model is 
doomed to failure. 
  The fact that, allegedly, Russia's businessmen are 
interested 
in the creation of another bureaucratic monster evokes surprise. 
As an entrepreneur, who over a period of 8 years has engaged in 
free economy, I can say one thing: I do not need a state body, 
which will drive me to capitalism. I think that all 
entrepreneurs need normal economic laws and taxes and not new 
bureaucratic administrators. 
  I consider the draft documents on the organization of the 
"Ministry of Capitalism" a mistake. 
  Such a body under the Government of the Russian Federation 
can be useful only as a public body not forming part of the 
authorized staff of the Government of the Russian Federation. 
  Respectfully, 
  [Signed] Prof. S.N. Fedorov, general director of the Moscow 
"Mikrokhirurgiya glaza" Scientific and Technical Complex

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Teslenko: "Russian Jewelers Want To </F>
Restore the Borders of the USSR: Russia's Diamond Producers Have 
Formed an Association"] 
  [Text] A Diamond Producers Association has been 
created in Russia. It was organized under the patronage of the 
Roskomdragmet [Russian Committee for Precious Metals], the 
chairman of which--Yevgeniy Bychkov--was elected president of 
the association. Yesterday the new organization obtained 
Certificate No. 32211 at the Moscow Registration Office, which 
signifies the de facto beginning of its work. 
  The decision to create this association was adopted on 21 
April at a session attended by its founders--the leading 
officials of six diamond organizations: three plants in the 
Kristall system (Barnaul, Moscow, and Smolensk), three very 
large joint ventures (Intertreyd, Kristalldiam, and Ruiz 
daymond), as well as the Almazyuvelireksport Foreign-Trade 
Association and the Federation of Trade Unions of Workers in the 
Mining and Metallurgical Industry. 
  The new association's charter declares measures aimed at 
developing the Russian diamond industry and at increasing its 
competitiveness on the world market. This organization intends 
to render consultative assistance to all of Russia's 
diamond-cutting enterprises, regardless of their forms of 
ownership. Included among its potential clients are 
approximately 100 legal entities already having licenses to cut 
diamonds. 
  The association sees its special goal as helping in the 
cooperation between diamond-processing plants of the CIS 
countries: Located in Kiev, Vinnitsa, Gomel, Yerevan, and 
Chardzhu are large plants specializing in the production of very 
high quality diamonds--the so-called "Russian cut," or "fine 
cut." After the disintegration of the USSR, these plants were no 
longer able to obtain a full supply of raw materials--basically, 
diamonds from Yakutiya. During the years 1992-1993 they began to 
obtain significant supplies of raw materials from foreign 
firms--for example, Belgium and Israel. Their products are 
already competitive with Russian diamonds on world markets 
inasmuch as the sector of high-quality diamonds is a 
comparatively narrow one. It should be said that contacts with 
the above-listed CIS plants have already been established by 
Almazyuvelireksport and the Yakutsk company entitled Tumaada 
Daymond. And two Yakutsk-Ukrainian joint ventures have been 
created. 
  In the words of its executive director--Ararat Evoyan--the 
new association will take steps to make sure that the "Russian 
cut" being turned out by the CIS plants and the products of 
their Russian colleagues will be sold on the world markets 
within a framework of thoroughgoing cooperation. 
  The Diamond Producers Association of Russia was founded as 
an 
analogy with such organizations in other countries, having the 
typical purposes of civilized lobbying for favorable customs and 
tax laws, as well as combating the producers of fake (infused) 
diamonds.

"Government Explains What Was in the Package"] 
  [Text] Last week the Russian Government, perplexed by 
the ambiguous press reaction, held a press conference, where 
journalists were given explanations about the published and new 
documents being prepared for signing, which were drafted with 
the participation of the government and the president's 
apparatus and which concern the country's economic life. The 
meeting was held in the Hall of Awards of the White House, 
which, according to the organizers' idea, was supposed to reward 
the press for the lack of timely comments by the country's 
government on the package of the president's six edicts. 
  At a meeting with journalists Vice-Premier and Minister of 
Economics Aleksandr Shokhin announced that the recent signing of 
the package of edicts in no way attests to disagreements between 
the government and the president's apparatus. The documents were 
prepared jointly. From the vice-premier's speech it was apparent 
that the sluggishness of the legislative process carried out by 
the parliament forced the government and the president to "push 
on" by means of edicts the development of reforms in the country 
in order to stimulate deputies to adopt changes in legislation 
before the beginning of vacations. 
  The minister admitted that the president's recent edict on 
reform of state enterprises contains only part of the measures 
worked out by the government in this direction. Apparently, an 
edict on the procedure for the sale of insolvent enterprises 
will be signed soon. (On 20 May the government issued decree No 
498 "On Some Measures for the Realization of Legislation on the 
Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises," which contains 
clear-cut criteria for placing enterprises in the category of 
insolvent ones on the basis of balance indicators). 
  According to Mr. Shokhin, the evaluation of bankrupt 
enterprises will be made as of 1 January 1994. The client will 
have to pay 20 percent of the selling price right away. These 
funds will be assigned for the liquidation of debts to 
creditors. Subsequently, 50 percent of the cost is to be 
assigned for the upkeep of the social sphere of the sold 
enterprise. The minister added that negotiations on granting 
credits to Russia for the maintenance of the social sphere of 
enterprises, which were bankrupt during the transitional period, 
are now being conducted with the G-7. The World Bank gave its 
preliminary consent to the granting of such tied credits. 
  Aleksandr Shokhin admitted that the approach to the 
bankruptcy procedure should be noted for special care, because 
it is very expensive. (According to estimates by some directors 
of administrations, it is cheaper to continue paying wages to 
workers during a complete shutdown of an enterprise than to 
fully carry out its bankruptcy process, where they "work"). In 
this connection the minister called upon the Federal 
Administration for Insolvency of Enterprises under the State 
Committee on the Administration of State Property not to make 
long lists of candidates for bankruptcy as long as the problem 
of the funds, with which their recovery will be carried out, is 
not solved. He referred to his own experience gained by him when 
he was chairman of the Commission on Problems of Coal Mining 
Enterprises. According to Aleksandr Shokhin, at that time the 
management of a number of mines openly insisted on the closure 
of production facilities in the hope of obtaining substantial 
monetary injections guaranteed during the conduct of 
bankruptcies by the state. 
  The vice-premier was unable to mention the amount of funds 
provided by the federal budget in 1994 for bankruptcy 
procedures. (The number of enterprises officially declared 
bankrupt on the list reaches thousands. Moreover, the budget has 
not yet been approved by items). However, nor does the 
government agree with the proposals of the Ministry of Labor to 
the effect that an "active ousting of manpower" will soon begin 
in the economy. (The latest data on the rise in unemployment are 
presented in the survey of consumer prices on pages 53-55. In 
our opinion, in general, it is too late to make proposals and to 
debate them). 
  Judging by the words of the minister of economics, the state 
intends to examine the property belonging to it without delay 
and, to begin with, to take an inventory of enterprises. Right 
now it is quite obvious that an enterprise based on full 
economic management, to put it mildly, is a form not profitable 
for the state. It presupposes a distribution of roles, under 
which the management of an enterprise adopts decisions 
independently, but bears no responsibility for their 
consequences. Aleksandr Shokhin believes that the right of labor 
collectives (according to the Law on Enterprises and 
Entrepreneurial Activity) to choose the production manager as 
they wish will also contribute to such an infringement of state 
rights. 
  It seems that from now on the state will try to more 
strictly 
control the system of management of state enterprises. For 
example, Aleksandr Shokhin concluded, there is an urgent 
question concerning the personal responsibility of the 
representatives of state interests in joint-stock companies, the 
shares of which it owns. An appropriate certificate will be 
handed to the authorized representative. It will enable him to 
participate in voting with due regard for the number of votes 
falling to the share of the state. For now, however, according 
to the testimony of the minister of economics, several 
representatives of ministries and departments often defend state 
interests in joint-stock companies at the same time and, 
ultimately, those guilty and responsible for adopted decisions 
are not found. 
  Commenting on the government decision on a reduction in 
export duties on petroleum, Aleksandr Shokhin assured those 
gathered that this measure "levels out the situation of 
petroleum exporters, because it is supplemented by the abolition 
of unsubstantiated privileges for some of them." Thus, a 
reduction in duties on oil is balanced out by the receipt of 
payments on the part of former "recipients of privileges" and 
the effect of the adopted measures on the state of the state 
treasury will prove to be neutral. True, the vice-premier added, 
the decree on the abolition of privileges for exporters has not 
yet been signed, because it will apply to an entire list of 
licensed goods and provides for the preparation of a list of 
exceptions--goods for which licensing is to be preserved (for 
example, narcotic substances, weapons, and so forth). 
  In his speech Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko 
also set forth the position of his department on the matter of 
export privileges. "The Ministry of Finance fundamentally 
opposes the granting of privileges," he declared. Mr. 
Aleksashenko did not confirm the rumors on a rise in tax rates, 
which have agitated the market recently. In his opinion, 
although legislative initiative in the revision of tax rates 
belongs to the parliament, such changes hardly await the economy 
in the current year. "Budget revenues for 1994 have been 
determined and, consequently, a revision of rates before 1995 is 
impossible." 
  Vladimir Gusev, director of the State Tax Service, 
responding 
to the question of KOMMERSANT, declared that, in fact, the state 
fails to collect substantial sums in the form of tax deductions. 
Among the reasons for the reduction in tax budget revenues Mr. 
Gusev mentioned not only the evasion of tax payment, but also 
the nonpayment crisis, which has gripped the national economy. 
According to his information, total arrears now amount to 8 
trillion rubles. Funds reported by enterprises for payment, but 
in reality absent in payers' accounts, account for 28 percent of 
them. However, the state, Mr. Gusev reported, took a number of 
steps to toughen the tax collection procedure. Tax bodies 
received the right to levy execution upon debtors' current and 
deposit accounts and the possibility of levying execution upon 
their property is now being examined. (We present Central Bank 
Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko's point of view of the recovery of 
funds from the deposit account on page 11). 
  At the meeting with journalists government representatives 
paid special attention to a discussion of the problem concerning 
the activity of foreign banks in Russia's territory. We will 
recall that the history of the "movement of resistance" to the 
penetration of foreign banks into the country had already begun 
under the previous parliament. When passions were inflamed 
properly, in Russia about a dozen foreign banks either had 
already received a bank license for the performance of 
operations, or awaited this. Deputies of the former parliament 
tried to make a number of changes in banking legislation, which 
would introduce a moratorium on the receipt of licenses by new 
claimants from the international banking community. Foreign 
banks, which already had a general license of the Central Bank 
of Russia, were offered, in essence, to switch over to the 
offshore regime of work (with the right to service nonresidents 
and with a ban on operations with rubles). The parliament decree 
on the implementation of the mentioned amendments was disputed 
by the government and immediately fell under the president's 
veto. 
  However, the history with foreign banks received a sudden 
and 
an extremely unexpected continuation. The president's edict, 
which refuted his own veto, was issued on 17 November 1993 on 
the threshold of the elections. It followed from the text of the 
document that foreign banks (as well as joint ones, where more 
than 50 percent of the shares belong to foreign participants) 
operating in Russia's territory... will be transferred to the 
offshore regime until 1996 if they do not manage to acquire 
Russian clients until 15 November 1993. 
  Representatives of the international banking community, 
obviously, did not like the Russian saying "he who is not on 
time is late." This precisely was gently pointed out to the 
Russian President during his visit to Brussels. Representatives 
of the European Union perceived the edict on foreign banks as a 
measure worsening the banking climate in Russia, which, 
obviously, contradicted the agreement with the European 
Community signed by our country. The American Senate warned 
Russia that the barriers established for U.S. banks would 
involve American retaliatory measures. Then the biggest Russian 
commercial banks, which decided to enter the European market, 
felt a vague opposition on the part of local authorities. The 
latter felt that they were entitled to this: What can the 
applicants expect if they themselves have just slammed the door 
in the face of their foreign colleagues? 
  The government and the Central Bank were instructed to 
rectify the situation until 8 June of this year. The draft of 
the president's edict, which lifts the restrictions on the 
activity of foreign banks in Russia, has already been prepared 
and, as Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank, reported, 
"will be published any day now." According to Aleksandr Shokhin, 
Russia signed an additional agreement with the European 
Community "on encouragement and protection of investments." The 
prime minister also reported that a 12-percent barrier on the 
amount of authorized capital is retained for foreign banks in 
Russia. (This means that the combined authorized capital of 
foreign banks operating in the country's territory should not 
exceed 12 percent of the total authorized capital of all the 
registered Russian commercial banks). Furthermore, for several 
years foreign banks have been prohibited from working with 
Russian securities. The next technical restriction for 
subsidiary banks (also temporary) concerns balances in clients' 
accounts. According to the draft document, they cannot be less 
than 50,000 ECU (58,600 dollars). This measure, according to its 
developers' idea, will not enable foreign banks to actively work 
with private individuals. 
  The government decision to rectify the situation with 
foreign 
banks was given a hostile reception by the Association of 
Russian Banks. Sergey Yegorov, its president, speaking at a 
press conference on 1 June, spoke in favor of a time-out in the 
admission of foreign banks into Russia. He again repeated the 
well-known argument of the fighters against the penetration of 
foreign banks into Russia: The need to introduce a preferential 
period for the development of Russian commercial banks. In the 
opinion of representatives of the Association of Russian Banks, 
the resistance to the opening of affiliates and departments of 
Russian banks in the territory of other states should be 
overcome by means of ultimatums. Apparently, this type of 
agreement presupposes a scheme similar to the procedure for the 
exchange of hostages: A permit for the opening of an affiliate 
of a Russian bank in a respective country should correspond to a 
permit for the opening of a foreign bank in Russia. In the 
opinion of KOMMERSANT, this cannot be, because this can never 
be. Even if foreign bankers agreed to communicate in the 
language of ultimatums, the question of the criteria of an 
"equivalent exchange" would arise then and there. It is unlikely 
that any of Russia's most promising commercial banks will be 
able to honorably withstand such a competition. 
  Upon the conclusion of the government press conference 
KOMMESANT experts got the impression that the second batch of 
presidential edicts would be much more substantive and, 
apparently, more intelligible than the first, which consisted of 
six edicts and was represented in the notorious "reformer" 
package of 23 May.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Bekker: "Boris Fedorov Tortures Central Bank </F>
in the English Manner"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Central Bank Will Not Refuse To Keep an Eye on Commercial </H5>
Banks 
  The Duma Subcommittee on Policy and Activity of the Central 
Bank held a second round of hearings on the operation of the 
Central Bank. Their initiator, Boris Fedorov, as agreed with 
Viktor Gerashchenko, intends meeting with heads of various 
Central Bank departments during the summer in order to, in the 
words of the subcommittee chairman, "obtain as much information 
as possible" about the bank. Twice a week Room 838 in the State 
Duma will turn into "a torture chamber," when the dialogue 
between Russian deputies and the bankers will take place in the 
rigid fashion of the British parliament. No reports, only 
questions and answers. "We are not going into discussions," Mr. 
Fedorov observed, as if underscoring a strictly practical 
interest, free of confrontation. The final outcome of the 
meetings is seen by him to be the compilation of a full 
shorthand record and elaboration of practical recommendations on 
the development of the banking business in the country. 
  At yesterday's hearings the principal respondents were 
Dmitriy Tulin, deputy chairman of the Central Bank, and Nadezhda 
Ivanova, deputy chairman of the Department of Banking 
Supervision. That department engages in the licensing of banking 
operations, analysis of bank reporting procedures, elaboration 
of standards, supervision of banks to prevent bankruptcy, 
preparation of clearing operations, and liquidation of 
commercial banks. The last function was defined by Mr. Tulin as 
"not peculiar to the Central Bank," explaining its necessity as 
being due to the transition period and the establishment of a 
new banking order. Work on perfection of the taxation system was 
also mentioned by the deputy chairman of the Central Bank as 
being outside the operational profile of the Central Bank. 
  Issuance of licenses is considered to be the main task of 
the 
main bank. At the local level the main administrations of the 
Central Bank appear as their issuers. According to the 
assurances of Mrs. Ivanova, territorial administrations do not 
abuse their right, and refuse licenses for commercial banks only 
in rare cases, limited by law. As Mr. Tulin added, the laws of 
the Russian Federation do not allow rejection of a candidate for 
the post of chairman of a commercial bank. Even though there are 
Central Bank methodological instructions on the evaluation of 
professional qualities, neither they, nor the term of three 
months allowed for confirmation, permit the revelation of all 
there is to know about a manager, who, as Boris Fedorov said, 
could have a record of "two defunct banks and theft of 
customers' money." 
  The Central Bank, of course, is not completely defenseless. 
In 1993 it used its right and canceled licenses of 19 commercial 
banks, while this year licenses were taken away from 21 
commercial banks. In addition to its own criteria for steep 
measures, the Central Bank also responds to requests from 
customs and tax services. It is true that the Central Bank does 
not work logically in this case either and tries not to cancel a 
license until a decision is reached by an arbitration court 
regarding bankruptcy, while the court needs a license 
cancellation in order to recognize bankruptcy. The Central Bank 
does break this closed circle, but according to Mrs. Ivanova, 
"orders concerning the closing of banks are strictly individual." 
  In order to avoid such an extreme outcome the Central Bank 
worked out a number of norms for the commercial banks. One of 
the risk limits is determined by the norm of capital 
sufficiency. Evaluative indices of current and long-term 
liquidity and maximum amount of risk per borrower are outdated 
and will probably be repealed. But as of last year the open 
currency position is being restricted, and a standard was 
introduced limiting the investment of their own capital by 
commercial banks in the charter funds of other commercial 
organizations--a limit of 10 percent exists for capital invested 
in one enterprise, and 50 percent "for the entire circle" of 
firms. In the opinion of Mr. Tulin, "Banking supervision earns 
no laurels for the Central Bank," inasmuch as it makes up 90 
percent of the load. But "it is not yet time" to remove that 
burden. Despite the existing conflicts with commercial banks 
"we, like no one else, understand their problems and are helping 
to protect their interests," concluded the deputy chairman of 
the Central Bank. 
  That debate developed in connection with proposals to 
withdraw the Department of Banking Supervision from the 
structure of the Central Bank. Similar discussions, by the way, 
are under way in the United States with respect to the Federal 
Reserve System. Konstantin Lubenchenko, director of the Legal 
Department, is convinced that in Russia such a "divorce" is at 
the very least premature inasmuch as "only the Central Bank has 
at its disposal all the information on operations being 
conducted by the commercial banks." He also cited the following 
fact to prove his point: According to the International Monetary 
Fund, banking supervision services "are included" within the 
structure of their national banks in 80 percent of the countries. 
  Confirming the thesis of Mr. Tulin concerning protection of 
the interests of commercial banks by the Central Bank, Mrs. 
Ivanova said that "it is necessary to change the entire order of 
their taxation." According to her, banks are currently paying 
around 30 forms of taxes and the ratio of payments to net profit 
amounts to 58 percent, which is "excessively high." "Commercial 
banks lack the profits to create reserves for covering shaky 
credit, and that could lead to the collapse of the entire 
banking system", declared the deputy chairman of the department. 
She also said that proposals calling for a review of the 
commercial bank taxation system were forwarded to the Federation 
Council.

<F P=106> [Roundup of bankers' reaction to Yeltsin banking system </F>
edict and other comment by Vladislav Borodulin and Vadim Bardin: 
"The Documents Issued as the Result of Yeltsin's `Press'"] 
  [Text] Yesterday Boris Yeltsin signed the second 
package in the series of economic edicts promised earlier. 
Experts from the government and the president's office worked 
all night to be in time for Yeltsin's anniversary press 
conference. The group issuing the president's documents did not 
work as expeditiously: only four of the five edicts were 
officially distributed yesterday. The edict on the banking 
system did not appear outside the Kremlin. 
  Judging by the extensive list of documents being 
prepared, yesterday's package will not be the last surge of 
activity by the executive authority before the summer lull. 
<H5>  The President Did not Promise Every Family an Apartment by </H5>
the Year 2000 
  The presidential edicts issued yesterday provide every 
reason 
for the executive authority to substantially reduce the pace of 
its work, if not leave on vacation. Package No. 2 filled the 
niche, empty since May, of the authorities' attention to social 
problems and relationships with foreign financial organizations. 
<H5>  Edicts signed by Boris Yeltsin on 10 June: </H5>
  --"On housing loans"; 
  --"On the issuance and circulation of housing certificates"; 
  --"On measures to finish incomplete housing construction"; 
  --"On improving the work of the Russian Federation banking 
system"; and 
  --"On protection of consumers." 
<H5>  Edicts Being Prepared for Signing: </H5>
  --"On increasing the responsibility of state enterprise 
directors"; 
  --"On protecting the rights of investors and citizens in the 
securities market"; and 
  --"On the customs procedure for commodities for investment 
projects." 
<H5>  Basic Provisions of the Edict "On the Issuance and </H5>
Circulation of Housing Certificates": 
  --When houses are built, juridical persons with the rights 
of 
a buyer have the right to issue housing certificates; 
  --The volume of an emission of housing certificates 
(expressed in units of overall living space) may not exceed the 
total volume of housing being built by a buyer; and 
  --The minimum rated value of a housing certificate may not 
be 
less than 0.1 square meter. 
<H5>  Basic Provisions of the Edict "On Housing Credits": </H5>
  --Credit is extended for housing construction if the builder 
is allotted a plot of land and has authorization to build 
housing from the appropriate organs; 
  --There may be thre types of loans: a loan to purchase land, 
a short-term loan to build housing, and a long-term loan to 
purchase housing; 
  --The total amount of credit issued should not exceed 70 
percent of the cost to build or purchase housing; 
  --The basic documents which determine the relationships 
between the bank and the borrower in granting a loan are the 
loan agreement and the security contract (on the mortgage); and 
  --A plot of land under construction, completed housing or 
incomplete construction, and other forms of property and 
property rights may be an item of security. 
  The reasons for issuance of the decrees "On housing 
loans," "On the issuance and circulation of housing 
certificates," and "On measures to finish incomplete housing 
construction" are very logical and clear--the idea that it 
is precisely the construction industry which will become the 
"locomotive" of the Russian economy has been popular in the 
government for a long time. Moreover, the edict on housing loans 
legalizes the mortgage concept, which has been put into practice 
quite extensively. The Supreme Soviet did not have time to 
approve a corresponding draft law. The underlying social reason 
for these decisions is obvious as well--there are few average 
Russians who can gain a thorough understanding of the subtleties 
of export allocation and licensing (the net result of Package 
No. 1 was the idea of liberalizing Russian exports). 
  However, for those who authored the housing construction 
edicts--the State Committee on Questions of Architecture and 
Construction [Goskomarkhitektury]--there are reasons of a more 
prosaic nature to advocate their quick approval. A package of 
government decrees on measures to support the construction 
complex--and not without budget participation, of course--should 
be rushing to catch up with these edicts. Yefim Basin, chairman 
of the Goskomarkhitektury, estimates the overall volume of unmet 
demand for housing at 14 trillion rubles [R] and the area of 
housing that has not been completed at 40 million square meters 
(42 million square meters were built in 1993). 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
<H5>  Basic Provisions of the Edict "On Protection of Consumers' </H5>
Rights" 
  Upon its publication, the advertising of banks and 
financial, 
insurance, and investment companies must: 
  --specify the actual amounts of dividends paid for common 
registered stocks over the past fiscal year; 
  --specify the date and registration number of the securities 
issue being advertised; and 
  --not permit announcement of guarantees, promises, or 
assumptions about the future effectiveness of their activity. 
  Yeltsin's edict "On protection of consumers" [sic] pursues 
objectives that are even more populist. The aims of this 
document were formulated by the president himself: it is 
necessary "to put advertising activity in order and ensure that 
a person has the right to reliable financial information." The 
authorities' attempts to spare their fellow citizens from the 
illusions that they can buy "a house in Paris" with the 
dividends from securities are very much justified: in the event 
that their commercial undertakings fail, Russian investors 
prefer to appeal to the state, not the firm that deceived them. 
According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY information, Russian banks, 
concerned about the increase in competition from nonbanking 
financial institutions in attracting the funds of private 
investors, played an important role in pushing through the edict. 
<H5>  Foreign Banks in Russia Have been Rehabilitated </H5>
  The pendulum of the president's edicts concerning operations 
by foreign banks in Russian territory with the funds of Russian 
residents has once again been put into motion. 
  On 17 November 1993, this activity was frozen until 1 
January 1996 by the edict "On activity by foreign banks and 
joint banking ventures with the participation of nonresidents in 
Russian Federation territory." The clause in the edict stating 
that its restrictions are not extended to those foreign banks 
which did not have time to begin serving Russian residents 
before 15 November 1993 was good news for only two banks: 
"Lionskiy Kredit," a subsidiary bank of Credit Lyonnais, and the 
joint bank Dresdner Bank (FRG) and BNP (France). All the rest of 
the 10 that were planning to begin operating in the Russian 
market, which had already received licenses from the TsB 
[Central Bank] of Russia, turned out to be "losers." 
  Now the president has given the green light to European 
foreign banks in Russia. It is a reasonable question: what 
prompted the president to rehabilitate the foreign banks ahead 
of time? While in November the spirit of the president's edict 
was directly contrary to his edict of 27 September "On improving 
work with foreign investments," it was brought about chiefly by 
election campaign considerations, not by calculations that 
victory would be achieved by orientation toward a liberal-market 
ideology with emphasis on priority support for the interests of 
Russian business or a rejection of more prohibitive measures, 
and it is more pragmatic in nature. 
  At least three circumstances attest to this. First of all, 
it 
is obvious that opening the Russian market to foreign banks is 
one of the conditions for granting Russia deferments in paying 
its foreign debt to the Paris Club. And creditors' patience has 
evidently run short. 
  Secondly--and this is confirmed by the fact that European 
banks are the ones that have been most active thus far in 
penetrating the Russian financial market--opening the doors to 
foreign banks is aimed at facilitating the talks that are 
actively under way on Russia's partnership in the European 
Community. In principle, it has not been ruled out that this 
liberalization will be followed by reciprocal liberalization by 
Russia's trading partners, and this may alleviate antidumping 
sanctions from the EC. An answer to this question may be given 
on 23 June at a meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Jacques 
Delors, where it is planned in particular to coordinate Russian 
quotas for aluminum and uranium exports to the EC. 
  Thirdly--and this is perhaps what is most important, the 
appearance of foreign banks in the Russian market should in 
theory contribute to a solution of two extremely critical 
problems in the Russian economy. Despite the rapid increase in 
commercial banks, the credit development field in Russia 
continues to be inadequate for the requirements of a market 
economy. This is shown by comparing the structure of the money 
supply in Russia and the United States. It follows from this 
that Russia is significantly ahead of the United States in the 
proportion of cash and funds accumulated in the accounts of 
enterprises and in public savings, but on the other hand, it 
lags behind in the amount of commercial credit that is extended. 
In this sense, the chronic nonpayments are a form of 
compensation for the lack of development in credit 
relationships. The new opportunities being opened by the 
presence of foreign banks in the Russian market may also 
revitalize the moribund investment process. The epochal 
formation of the Investment Finance Consortium, despite the 
importance of the precedent of government interaction with the 
banks and investment companies in stimulating private 
investments, attests to the narrowness of investment supply. The 
overall volume of state guarantees for securities of the 
consortium amounts to R800 billion, and this year R8 billion 
will be mobilized altogether. Foreign direct investments, the 
need for which has finally been acknowledged in the Russian 
Government, will come through these foreign banks; however, this 
has not prevented it from breaking up the Russian Agency for 
International Cooperation and Development--a federal organ 
charged with implementing the policy of attracting foreign 
investments. 
  As far as public reaction is concerned, it is absolutely 
clear that the politicians, the bankers, and businessmen view 
this change in different ways. Unexpected arguments are already 
circulating: giving foreign banks access to Russian residents' 
accounts will leave the CIA with nothing to do. It may be said 
in response to this that the largest data bank on all Russian 
enterprises is being held by the Goskomimushchestvo [State 
Committee on the Administration of State Property], and 
specialists of the World Bank and other Western financial 
organizations providing Russia with technical assistance in 
carrying out privatization have had legal access to the data for 
a long time. Nevertheless, from the viewpoint of prospects for 
development of the national economy, the pluses of the foreign 
banks' arrival in Russia outweigh the minuses, all the same. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
<H8>  Reaction by Russian Bankers to the President's Edict </H8>
  Andrey Tsimaylo, vice president of Most-Bank: 
"There are specific differences between the banking system of 
any state and other sectors of the economy. The banks are akin 
to the militia and the army--both constitute elements of 
national security. For this reason, the national banking system 
should be the last to be integrated into the international 
market (and hence, to permit full-fledged branches of foreign 
banks on its territory). This should not take place before 
Russian banks are standing on their feet, that is, when the 
largest of them have enough of their own funds to put them among 
the first thousand largest banks in the world. And for this it 
is essential that a bank have a minimum of $125 million of its 
own capital. 
  "And even in this case, it is not right to authorize foreign 
banks to serve residents. In other states, the 'other' banks 
take part in the capital market and the interbank market, but 
the national banks serve their clients. 
  "By authorizing foreign banks to serve residents today, we 
can forget about national security. Each bank knows the history, 
the problems. and the financial capabilities and plans of each 
client. Foreign banks will also have the same information on 
resident clients in Russia. Not one of the world's intelligence 
services even dreamed of this. 
  "They say that foreign banks will finally teach you how to 
operate. On the contrary, it is more likely that we will be 
teaching them how to operate in the Russian market--with the GKO 
[expansion unknown] and with gold certificates. And Russian 
bankers increase their skill this way--those same Western banks 
organize the seminars at which Russian employees are trained. 
  "They say that foreign banks will bring new technologies 
into 
the Russian market. If this means equipment, many Russian banks 
have equipment today that is no worse, and perhaps even better. 
But if this refers to banking technologies, please tell us: who 
needs 30-year bonds with 4-percent profitability? 
  "They say that foreign banks will teach us how to treat a 
client. However, I am not convinced that they would extend 
credit to clients who have no credit history. 
  "Finally, they say that foreign banks will bring foreign 
investments with them. However, the lack of a foreign bank is 
not an obstacle to penetration by foreign investments. If any 
one of them wants to extend credit to AvtoVAZ [Volga Automotive 
Plant], it will do so even without a Russian 'branch.'" 
  Yakov Dubenetskiy, chairman of the board of the 
Promstroybank [Industrial Construction Bank] of Russia: "I 
think the presence of foreign banks in the Russian market meets 
our national interests over the long term. There is no question 
that foreign banks should be represented in Russia. However, it 
is not possible for them to conduct their activity today under 
the same conditions as the Russian banks." 
  Sergey Yegorov, president of the Association of Russian 
Banks: The association's position on this matter has been 
set forth on more than one occasion. We believe that the 
presence of full-fledged branches of foreign banks in the 
Russian market today will be disastrous for the Russian banking 
system. The overwhelming majority of Russian commercial banks 
canot be compared in size with even a comparatively small 
foreign bank. Countries with a much stronger national banking 
system do not allow foreign banks. But in Russia, the commercial 
banks have just barely come to their feet, and time is needed 
for them to be able to compete with foreign banks." 
  Boris Sergeyev,member of the board of "Tokobank": 
"Based on principle, not self-interest, we support the idea of 
liberalizing the conditions for activity by foreign banks. At 
the same time, it is reasonable to set some restrictions, such 
as limiting capital from Western banks to 12 percent of the 
total amount." 
  Saida Petrova, head of a department of the Moscow 
Export-Import Bank: "There is actually no banking system in 
Russia at this stage. All Russian commercial banks are 
essentially branches of the Central Bank--all banking turnover 
without exception goes through the RKTs [presumably: currency 
control center]. Western banks' transactions will bypass this 
system. It will be impossible to monitor the influx of foreign 
capital and its circulation in the country. As a result, we will 
witness the collapse of Russia's banking system, which has not 
been created yet."

<F P=106> [Report on Association of Russian Banks press conference by </F>
Boris Boyko and commentary by Financial Turnover Department: 
"The Sixth Paragraph Has Become Hated as Much as the Fifth One"] 
  [Text] Less than a week after signing of the 
president's edict "On improving the operation of the Russian 
Federation's banking system," which has been received with 
widespread public reaction both in Russia and in the West, the 
Association of Russian Banks (ARB) issued an official commentary 
on this decision by Boris Yeltsin. The main object of analysis, 
it was easy to assume, was not so much the edict itself as its 
sixth paragraph, which removes a number of the restrictions on 
foreign banks' activity set forth in November 1993. 
  Sergey Yegorov, president of the ARB; Aleksandr Smolenskiy, 
president of the "Stolichniy" Bank; Garegin Tosunyan, president 
of the Tekhnobank; Leonid Nevzlin, vice president of the 
"Menatep" Bank; and Vladimir Gusinskiy, president of the 
Most-Bank, took part in a press conference. 
  The overall tone of the press conference showed that in 
their 
choice of reasoning the representatives of Russian banks were 
quite familiar with the attitudes prevailing in the higher 
echelons of political authority. In criticizing the hated sixth 
paragraph, the emphasis was put on the danger it represents for 
the work of state construction in Russia. It is interesting that 
the political factor became almost dominant in the statements 
made by members of the banking elite. Thus, in the ARB's 
opinion, the president's decision gives an opportunity to 
"rightist forces" to take advantage of the presence of foreign 
banks in the Russian market "to inflame political passions." 
  The edict provided a reason for the association to declare a 
fundamental change in the state's policy of protectionism, 
which, in Vladimir Gusinskiy's words, should be no less than in 
Western countries, where it is quite difficult for a foreign 
bank to open a branch because of the numerous restrictions. 
Leonid Nevzlin was more dramatic: in his opinion, the 
president's decision threatens the very structure of Russian 
statehood--four or five large foreign banks are enough "to cut 
off oxygen to the Russian banking system." In addition, the 
example given by "Menatep" may illustrate the increasing force 
of this dangerous trend--under the threat of a breakdown, plans 
have appeared to attract foreign investments by selling some of 
the Russian banks' stock shares to foreign banks. 
  Despite the good preparation, the sense of proportion 
changed 
at times for the press conference participants: in the words of 
Garegin Tosunyan, a campaign is under way to discredit Russian 
banks connected with the general tendency "to turn pink and turn 
red" in domestic policy. As a result, proposals are showing up 
at the state level to nationalize all banks altogether on the 
grounds that they allegedly have been tainted by crime. 
  The argument that the Russian banking system was unprepared 
for severe competition with foreign banks sounded more 
meaningful. There are now 2,000 commercial banks and 4,800 of 
their branches operating in Russia now (one bank for each 
administrative rayon). At the same time, the oldest Russian 
commercial bank is only 5 years old. Because they are relatively 
new, Russian banks can offer clients only 70 to 80 types of 
service, whereas their foreign competitors are able to provide 
up to 3,000 types of service. In this connection, subsequent 
statements by a number of the press conference participants that 
they did not fear foreign competition appeared to be somewhat 
contradictory. Especially as reputable Western banks such as 
Deutsche Bank believe their presence in Russia is premature, 
according to Sergey Yegorov. 
  The conclusion that the presence of foreign banks would 
serve 
no purpose for the Russian economy appears to be more logical. 
In the opinion of the press conference participants, 
opportunities are being made available to pump rubles out of 
Russia instead of to attract foreign investments. As Mr. 
Gusinskiy stated, the conditions for reservation of banking 
capial in Western countries do not make it possible to invest 
more than $20 million to $30 million per year in the Russian 
economy because of the high degree of political risk. In this 
connection, the KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts would like to emphasize 
one thought expressed in the statement by Garegin Tosunyan: in 
spite of the frequent declarations by the government, the 
conditions needed for investments by Russian banks in the 
Russian economy have not been created. Compensation for the 
absence of a normal investment climate in the country cannot be 
provided by financial institutions from the West.

<H5>  From the ARB appeal to the international banking community </H5>
  Consolidation and development of the banking business are 
almost decisive in beginning the successful formation and 
development of a market economy. However, the Russian banking 
system is only coming to its feet, and all the capital of our 
banks is less than the capital of any foreign bank. This does 
not mean a fear of competition, but apprehension about the 
restoration of Russia's national economy and its entry into the 
world community as an equal partner. The international banking 
community should also take something else into 
consideration--there are forces in Russia which take advantage 
of the presence of foreign banks in our market in order to 
instill in people's consciousness that national property is 
being sold off and to break through on this wave to the 
structures of authority and their powers. 
  This is why the widespread presence of foreign banks in 
Russia is premature today. Not only Russia, but the entire world 
community will lose. We appeal for the declaration of a 
moratorium on opening branches of foreign banks in Russia for a 
year and a half. 
<H5>  From the ARB letter to the President of Russia </H5>
  In gaining access to our financial market, foreign banks are 
accumulating a substantial part of Russian funds. It is obvious 
that they will make use of foreign banks to extend credit to 
their traditional clients, the foreign companies in Russia, 
which will not attract the expected Western investments for this 
reason, but take advantage of our financial resources. This will 
lead to a significant outflow of Russian national capital and 
intensify the already critical situation in domestic industry. 
  We hope the admission of three more of the largest foreign 
banks into Russia's financial market is the only exception to 
the procedure which you established, that the government and the 
Central Bank will require states in the European Community to 
allow adequate representation in their countries by branches of 
the largest Russian commercial banks. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
<H5>  Commentary </H5>
  It is generally known that the position of Russian 
commercial 
banks on the presence of foreign banking structures in the 
domestic market varies. In this sense, the ARB position reflects 
only the views on this problem of most Russian banks, presenting 
a certain average opinion, and it does not take into account the 
most extreme positions for this reason. A number of banks (for 
example, the International Moscow Bank and TOKOBANK) consider it 
possible to open the Russian market for their foreign colleagues 
now, but others (in particular, the Most-Bank) believe even the 
period up to 1996 is too liberal. 
  In the opinion of the ARB leadership, the differences in 
views are explained chiefly by the different priorities (tactics 
or strategy) given preference by the banks. For example, the 
ones which are planning to open foreign branches in the near 
future or which have substantial foreign funds in their capital 
prefer not to force the situation. 
  However, even fervent opponents of the presence of foreign 
banks in the Russian market would probably soften their position 
if they had adequate opportunity to open their own branches 
abroad. But this is not happening at present. It is sufficient 
to remember the "Stolichniy" Bank's opening of its subsidiary 
bank in Holland, which was replete with all kinds of nuances. In 
the words of the bank's president, Aleksandr Smolenskiy, when 
the "Stolichniy" Bank was finally granted a license, the Central 
Bank of the Netherlands imposed serious restrictions on it: two 
of the three bank directors had to be Dutch; the ratio between 
Russian and Dutch personnel was set at 5 to 1; and restrictions 
were introduced on service for physical persons and an increase 
in assets and capital, as well as on the opening of additional 
branches. According to the bankers, similar conditions apply 
with respect to foreign banks in most European countries. 
  But the main apprehension of Russian bankers is that foreign 
banks will "take over the market," that is, they will win over 
their clients (to which the mentality of Russian citizens, who 
are very timid in dealing with anything foreign, will contribute 
to a substantial degree). But the foreign banks will direct the 
funds attracted in the market mainly to extend credit to their 
traditional clients--foreign firms. At the same time, in the 
bankers' words, four or five of the banks are enough to 
completely "cut off the oxygen" to the Russian banks. It is 
obvious in this case that the foreign banks will not be 
establishing branches and offices in Russian regions--Russians 
will have to occupy these. This is already quite apparent today, 
but with the reduction of an unfavorable base for banks, the 
establishment of branches will become unprofitable altogether. 
In following the Russian bankers' logic, it may be said that 
this will mean stagnation of the national banking market.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitold Fokin, president of the International </F>
Foundation for Humanitarian and Economic Ties with the Russian 
Federation, by Georgiy Dolzhenko, RT correspondent: "The Deed 
Must Be Done, Gentlemen"; Kiev, date not given] 
  [Text] Six months have passed since the International 
Foundation for Humanitarian and Economic Ties with the Russian 
Federation was set up in Ukraine. This step inspired hopes for 
re-establishing collapsed ties and improving cooperation between 
our countries. Of what was outlined, what have we succeeded in 
doing? What is within the power of the Foundation? Vitold Fokin, 
president of the Foundation, answers these and other 
questions. 
  [Dolzhenko] Vitold Pavlovich, first, a little history. How 
was the Foundation created, and what was the reason for its 
appearance? 
  [Fokin] That is not a simple question, since it touches on 
the period of my work as Ukrainian prime minister. I was always 
an adherent of a well-considered economic policy, and definite 
calculation in interrelations with the union republics. This 
pertained particularly to Russia. We should not have severed the 
established economic ties in ill-considered fashion, and 
abandoned the ruble zone headlong. 
  In defending this position, I made quite a few enemies at 
that time. Let us remember, what happened after the break-up of 
the USSR? Fifteen new states appeared on the political map of 
the Eurasian continent, having overnight turned from allies into 
competitors. Formally independent of each other, they were 
objectively tied by a common economic space. 
  Except that now the system for coordinating and dividing up 
work has changed in principle, and the basic power, transport, 
raw materials and export-import flows have been destroyed. Price 
and financial relations have been deregulated. Customs barriers 
have risen in the path of commodity movement. So far, no system 
of legislative administration of the markets of the new states 
has been created, and indeed, is not being created. 
  In struggling for formally recognized sovereignty, the 
countries will gradually convert the huge space of the former 
USSR into a zone of instability and numerous conflicts. 
  Ukraine is by no means an exception. The disintegration of 
production, an unfortunate financial and export-import policy, 
and tremendous foreign debt have led to our economy being cut 
off from the economy of our neighboring countries. 
  For a number of objective circumstances, the commanding 
state 
structures are incapable of putting matters right decisively. 
This naturally leads to the appearance of initiative on a 
different level. Our Foundation has become the expression of the 
will and striving of the leaders of our prestigious enterprises, 
scientific and social organizations, creative collectives, 
entrepreneurs and businessmen to seek and use non-traditional 
forms of cooperation among the CIS countries. The basis of this 
cooperation is economic expediency, mutual benefit and mutual 
trust and honesty. 
  [Dolzhenko] Does it not seem to you that Russia has only 
gained from the fact that Ukraine decided to go "its own" way. 
The Russian economy, as they think, has gone forward, but would 
it have succeeded in this in combination with Ukraine? Hopes for 
agreement within the framework of the CIS are very slim: 
essentially, not one of them will be fulfilled. What do you 
think about this? 
  [Fokin] I assume that 99 out of 100 of those polled would 
agree with you, complaining that reforms in Ukraine are "not 
moving." Although this is not quite so. They are moving, but 
every time in a different direction. It is this lack of 
sequence, the absence of continuity and the multitude of 
contradictions and mutual exclusions that are holding back 
progress. This instability is vicious. It makes increasingly 
perceptible the lagging behind Russia, blocking the already 
weakened ties between the enterprises of the two countries. 
  Russia, for example, has long given up the practice of the 
state order, although, in my opinion, prematurely. The 
enterprises have become the owners of the products. Most of the 
production facilities have become joint-stock companies, the 
securities market is working actively, and the convertibility of 
the ruble is stimulating small- and medium-scale business. 
  The main thing, though, is that the psychology of the people 
has changed. They are already thinking in new categories, and it 
will therefore be difficult for our state enterprise director to 
come to an agreement with the president of a Russian joint-stock 
company. He has completely different powers and interests. 
  Here, you realize, everything rests on not severing ties or 
lack of desire to cooperate for political reasons. The different 
level of development of production relations proves to be the 
decisive factor. It is extremely necessary to overcome these 
differences, and not to let them become disassociated. Both the 
Russians and the citizens of Ukraine are interested in this. The 
more time that passes since the moment of the break-up of the 
Union, the more aware we become of the need for these actions. 
  [Dolzhenko] The direction of the Foundation, in general, is 
clear, but all the same, just what are its specific goals and 
tasks? 
  [Fokin] The goal of the Foundation is all-round furthering 
of 
Ukrainian economic and cultural progress through direct 
cooperation between the enterprises and organizations, and 
educational and cultural centers of the CIS, above all Russia, 
and promotion of the integration of the Ukrainian economy into 
the world system. Our organization is state-social, 
non-government, and in no way do we intend to duplicate or 
replace the actions of the government administrative structures. 
On the contrary, we will take on the functions that are not 
characteristic of the state under the new conditions. 
  L. Kravchuk, President of Ukraine, fully understood and 
supported the idea of creating the Foundation. B. Yeltsin also 
supported it. 
  [Dolzhenko] The other day we received information on the 
registration of the Russian Foundation for Humanitarian and 
Economic Cooperation with Ukraine. 
  [Fokin] This is pleasing information. It will now be easier 
to solve the problems of cooperation. The Foundation was created 
through the efforts of well-known Russian state and public 
figures -- O. Lobov, Yu. Shafranik, Yu. Dubinin, L. Zapalskiy, 
Yu. Astayev, V. Kostyuk and others. The Russian Foundation, like 
ours, gained the status of a state-social organization. 
  [Dolzhenko] What are the basic directions of the activity of 
your Foundation? The humanitarian theme is mentioned first in 
the title. 
  [Fokin] We really are devoting a great deal of attention to 
humanitarian problems. Public health, ecology and, in 
particular, clearing up the consequences of the accident at the 
Chernobyl AES occupy a special place. 
  For example, under the aegis of the Foundation, a project in 
the field of cytogenetics is being developed. The unique 
conditions for study, and the very rich base of data on a 
nuclear accident and its consequences, accumulated at 17 
scientific-research institutes and scientific centers, will make 
it possible to carry out a set of measures to study the effect 
of radiation on man. Here, wide use will be made of the works of 
Aleksey Gostev, Russian scientist, a citizen of Ukraine. This 
courageous man, together with his wife and son, having been 
living in the 30-kilometer zone for 8 years. 
  The Foundation also intends to gather and disseminate 
reliable, objective information, and to cover the subject of the 
two peoples in detail. Preparation for the publishing of 
Ukrainian newspapers in Russia has already begun, and links are 
being set up between the mass information media of our countries. 
  [Dolzhenko] Considering your former position of 
prime-minister, and your profound knowledge of the Ukrainian 
economy, you can hardly watch its decline with indifference.... 
  [Fokin] Naturally. The Ukrainian national economic complex 
today is fettered by the paralysis of the credit-financial 
system. After all, the bankruptcy of the economic constituents 
is, in the overwhelming majority of cases, organized. Holding 
back clearing accounts and exceeding the credit "oxygen," is the 
easiest way to destroy industrial enterprises, put them up for 
auction, and buy them for a song. Here it is no longer a 
question of decline, but of infinity. 
  Our Foundation is doing intensive work on creating a 
multi-functional banking network, which will help to make it 
possible to set up the passage of payment documents of Ukrainian 
enterprises to their foreign partners and back. This will make 
it to a certain extent possible to avoid enslaving dependence on 
government financial structures and their unpredictable 
behavior. The participants in the Foundation are becoming the 
founders of our own bank, with a proposed charter capital of 
$5-10 million. Prestigious financial institutions of Russia and 
the Western countries are being drawn into cooperation. 
  Because full-value cooperation is possible only with equal 
starting conditions, and a serious imbalance has been noted, 
inasmuch as Russia has already virtually completed privatizing 
state enterprises, the re-establishment of production ties in 
many ways depends on the rates of privatization in Ukraine. 
  The Ukrainskiy Finansovo-Investitsionnyy Soyuz (UFIS) AO 
[Joint-Stock Company], working under the aegis of the 
Foundation, is assisting in this process. This firm possesses 
the necessary technology, and is staffed with fine specialists. 
They are helping to develop a privatization program for 
enterprises in sectors such as machine building, instrument 
making, petroleum processing, building materials, biochemistry 
and the light pulp and paper industry. At the same time, we are 
striving for a comprehensive approach, encompassing all stages 
of privatization, from assessing the property to issuing and 
placing securities, and after that, providing post-privatization 
service. 
  In the future, the Foundation will take part in setting up 
trans-national corporations of technologically linked production 
facilities, through joint-stockholding. A dealer network of the 
enterprises of Ukraine and Russia, and vice-versa, is slated for 
development. We are seriously engaged in drawing in foreign 
investments. Our assistance to enterprises lies in seeking 
investors, preparing the documents for extending credit and 
developing business plans. Information on potential subjects for 
investment are being disseminated along Foundation channels to 
the West. 
  [Dolzhenko] Vitold Pavlovich, when I listen to you, I keep 
thinking: why didn't you put such alluring ideas into effect 
before, in your days as premier? By the way, how did you, in 
your opinion, leave Ukraine's economy, and how do you assess it 
today? 
  [Fokin] Spare me, I'm not going to give an assessment of 
either the activity of my predecessors nor my successors. This 
is an unworthy occupation. One thing I can say, quoting 
impartial statistics. By the autumn of 1992, distinct signs of 
stabilization appeared in all sectors of Ukraine's economy. In 
June, the depression came to a halt, and in July and August the 
increase in the average daily production volume was fixed, not 
in the ephemeral monetary expression, but in physical indicators. 
  Wages were paid regularly, and inflation rates were cut to 8 
percent. What is there to say? The exchange rate of the dollar 
was 161 karbovanets, and not 50,000, as it is today. The value 
of the fixed production capital was brought into conformity with 
the rise in prices and monetary incomes. So, as compared with 
today's situation, is this good or bad? 
  As for converting ideas, the answer may prove to be 
unexpected: in the sphere of my actual activity, I have scarcely 
any more rights than in my days as premier. Allowing for the 
scale, of course. I am now surrounded by like-minded people, and 
not by dilettantes from parliamentary rostrums. 
  It is not by chance that the preceding Supreme Soviet of 
Ukraine ended its activity in such an inglorious fashion. Having 
restricted the rights of the executive bodies to a nonsensical 
limit, parliament itself passed sentence. Thank God that it 
managed without tanks. For almost four years, the country was 
shaken by legal nihilism. The Cabinet of Ministers should have 
pursued an active financial policy, but for it, the National 
Bank was sealed off. The Supreme Soviet managed the Bank, it was 
preparing a monetary reform. The State Property Fund and the 
Anti-Monopoly Committee were under it. 
  I came out in behalf of retaining the state order for 
strategic goods, since I realized that the brakes must be 
released gradually, but they accused me of conservatism. I 
proposed a soft system of state regulation and was branded an 
anti-marketist. I tried to maintain, in the transitional period, 
the basic structures of state administration, so that, as the 
forms of ownership changed, their functions would gradually be 
turned over to new formations. And what happened? At the 
beginning of March, from the voting in of one of the deputies, 
parliament carried out the decision to eliminate the leading 
sectorial ministries and departments. 
  It was precisely then that the possibility appeared of mass 
awarding of state property, in general, to the technical 
personnel of the newly created structures. The story of 
Ukraine's exit from the ruble zone occupies a special place in 
the chronicles of our parliament's evil deeds. I hope that it is 
still the subject of a special investigation. 
  Incidentally, your comment is reasonable, the Russian ruble 
has strengthened its position, by being relieved of a partner 
such as Ukraine. But enough about that. The difficult, tense 
work that lies ahead of us to re-establish the economy is 
incredible, and I have great hopes for the start of the new 
Supreme Soviet's activity. I wish it success with all my heart. 
  [Dolzhenko] Do you not regret today your unrealized dreams, 
and certain plans? 
  [Fokin] I have an urge to say: "No, I have no regrets." But 
this would not be true. Indifference is not inherent in me, nor 
is groundless optimism. I can clearly see what political 
ambitions and national arrogance can do to the economy. I regret 
the wasted efforts, the unrealized intentions. I will permit no 
thoughts of hopelessness, though. I often repeat the words of 
Chekhov's hero: "The deed must be done, Gentlemen."

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Fedorov: "How to Recognize Counterfeit </F>
Money"] 
  [Text] The number of counterfeit ruble bank notes, 
bank notes of convertible currency, and state securities in cash 
turnover have increased sharply in Russia and other CIS 
countries. The following figures indicate the dynamics of such 
crimes: last year they increased at a rate of over 2,120 percent 
and more than 7,060 cases of counterfeiting--21 times more than 
the previous year--were recorded. But if the difficulty in 
recognizing the counterfeit money is taken into account, many 
more of the crimes are actually being committed. 
  In analyzing the reasons for this type of crime, the 
specialists associate it with the interruption or weakening of 
economic ties among the republics. Taking advantage of this 
situation, criminals are actively saturating the currency market 
with a large number of counterfeits, including those with high 
printing quality. The fact that the free circulation of ready 
cash in foreign currency was banned previously in the Soviet 
Union is also very important. And bank and cashier personnel had 
no experience in determining the authenticity of one bank note 
or another. Even now they have practically no experience. 
  On the other hand, there is a convincing explanation for 
that. The extent to which even specialists are informed in 
determining the authenticity of paper bank notes has been 
extremely meager thus far. For example, they lack professional 
descriptions of SKV [convertible currency] bank notes, as well 
as the methods of identifying the means of protection and 
determining the authenticity of paper money. There is not enough 
of the equipment needed to test the bank notes. 
  There are specialized reference publications from Interpol, 
but they have not been adapted to conditions in the CIS 
countries and they are inaccessible to most users because of 
their high price. 
  The problem of combating the counterfeiting of money and its 
further illegal use is many-sided. And law enforcement and other 
organs have been called upon to play a specific role in solving 
it. But what is most important, it seems, is to improve the 
skill in this area of specialists in the financial field, as 
well as all citizens. The Moscow publishing firm "Ivan and 
Partnership" has made its contribution to a solution of this 
problem. It has begun turning out reference and procedural 
literature which makes it possible to test and expose 
counterfeit bank notes with a high degree of reliability. This 
work is being conducted with the participation of specialists 
from the Central Bank and the Russian Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. 
  According to the assessment of specialists in law 
enforcement 
organs, publications by the "Ivan and Partnership" firm contain 
the most complete description of convertible currency bank notes 
with a detailed analysis and illustration of the elements and 
degree of protection. In other words, the publications help one 
see for himself the high quality of printing in the bank notes. 
It is very difficult for any one of the counterfeiters to 
achieve such a level of quality. So it turns out that the 
workmanship here actively withstands counterfeiting. 
  In addition, in the experts' opinion, the firm's 
publications 
have an advantage over a similar publication from Interpol 
because of their saturation with information and simplicity for 
the user. 
  It is worth noting that the Russian Federation Ministry for 
Cooperation With CIS Member-States is very concerned about 
prospects in the struggle against counterfeiting. Incidentally, 
it conducted a special analysis of reference literature, both 
domestic and foreign, on the problem of exposing counterfeit 
bank notes and monitoring their authenticity, and it found the 
"Handbook on Convertible Currency Bank Notes" [Spravochnik 
banknot SKV] published by the "Ivan and Partnership" firm to be 
the most promising at this time. 
  There is a direct recommendation from the Ministry for 
Cooperation With CIS Member-States to organizations in CIS 
countries that they devote their attention to this handbook. 
They believe here that it contains a volume of knowledge that is 
unique in the world, and much of it is being published for the 
first time. The book actually presents a new system for visually 
monitoring the authenticity of bank notes on the spot. In short, 
the publication may become an indispensable aid both in banking 
and currency and cashier operations, as well as for the activity 
of criminological experts in law enforcement organizations. Let 
us hope that it will help us to climb one more step on the 
stairway leading to a civilized market.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Hryhoriy Omelchenko, member of the </F>
Supreme Council Presidium and chairman of the Commission on 
Matters To Combat Organized Crime and Corruption, by Aleksandra 
Parakhonya; place and date not given: "Hryhoriy Omelchenko: 'We 
Will Not Talk Only About the Mafia and Corruption. The Subject 
Will Be the Attempts To Destroy Ukraine Economically as an 
Independent State!'"] 
  [Text] As is known, passions raged last Friday in 
parliament's session hall. After a political statement by Yu. 
Zvyahilskyy and a letter signed by 122 deputies, the session 
decided to discuss the question of the situation that had arisen 
in connection with the attempt on the life of people's deputy 
Vladimir Bortnik. 
  We understand that an investigation is under way and 
that many circumstances and details regarding the tragic events 
of 30 May have still not been made known to us. Nevertheless.... 
are there not too many contradictions in the actions of the 
highest-ranking officials? Are there not too many "white spots" 
in this--let us say right out--"dark" affair? 
  Aleksandr Parakhonya, our correspondent, asked Colonel 
Hryhoriy Omelchenko, member of the Supreme Council Presidium and 
chairman of the Commission on Matters To Combat Organized Crime 
and Corruption, to comment on the situation. 
  [Omelchenko] I like and respect NEZAVISIMOST very much. That 
is why, although quite a few journalists have come to me with 
similar requests these days, I am granting this interview only 
to your newspaper. Neither Yu. Zvyahilskyy's political statement 
nor the letter signed by 122 deputies (as is known, People's 
Deputies Yu. Spizhenko and Yu. Boldyrev were the organizers for 
collecting the signatures) were unexpected by myself personally 
and many other people's deputies. Sooner or later, something 
similar had to be heard. I would say this: An objective process 
connected with the investigation of the criminal case regarding 
the attempt on the life of people's deputy Vladimir Bortnik is 
under way. 
  If you recall, I also spoke during that meeting and 
requested 
that normal conditions be established for the activity of the 
investigating operational group and that the safety of the 
members of this group and their families be assured. 
  Incidentally, one Kiev newspaper wrote ironically. It wrote 
that Zvyahilskyy is urging a struggle against the mafia, but 
Chairman Omelchenko of the commission to combat organized crime 
and corruption is proposing to keep silent. How much this 
corresponds to the truth, evidently, does not disturb the 
newspaper. It is sufficient to read the verbatim report of my 
presentation -- here it is, read it!-- and it will be clear that 
Omelchenko did not at all suggest to the deputies that there be 
silence. However, I do not consider it necessary to engage in 
polemics with this provocation; I will treat such statements 
with humor. It is natural that this conclusion rang out. It is 
fully contained in the chronology of events that we forecast and 
which are following one after the other.... 
  I will also not comment on Mr. Zvyahilskyy's political 
statement. My evaluation, just as that of any other individual, 
is subjective. I can agree with some of it and not with other 
parts of it. However, I would gladly put my signature under the 
statement's final thesis. In my copy of the session's verbatim 
report, that paragraph is marked "nota bene." I will quote it 
for the readers of NEZAVISIMOST: 
  "As a people's deputy of Ukraine performing the duties of 
the 
Ukraine's prime minister, I demand very decisive measures from 
the Ukraine's Supreme Council to protect the national interest 
of the state and the honor and dignity of its citizens; the 
investigation of all (we stress the word 'all'--G.O.) 
circumstances concerning the attempt on the life of people's 
deputy Vladimir Bortnik; rigorous observance of law, order, and 
legality; and the establishment of an effective legal mechanism." 
  I vote with both hands for this formulation of the question, 
and I will do everything that depends on me so that ALL 
circumstances in the Bortnik affair will be investigated with 
strict observance of legality and law and order. 
  [Parakhonya] Are you confident that the one who fired at 
Bortnik will be found? Who do you think it is? 
  [Omelchenko] In this case, who the specific individual is 
that made the attempt on the life of the people's deputy is not 
as important as who is behind him and who aimed his hand. One 
must determine the motives for the crime. As the ancients wisely 
said--who benefits? 
  Some officials hope very much to keep the motives secret. I 
will not mention names now for the sake of the investigation. I 
will pose the question of establishing a Supreme Council 
investigating commission, which will be able to investigate this 
matter fully, thoroughly, and objectively, jointly with the 
general procurator's investigating operational group, to the 
session of the Ukraine's Supreme Council in accordance with 
Article 109 of the Constitution--to dig down to the sources and 
to the roots! Moreover, I will secure from the Supreme Council 
and its Presidium the pronouncement of a decree on conducting a 
thorough inspection of the financial and economic activity and 
hard currency accounts of the concern that people's deputy 
Vladimir Bortnik heads, and also of the other state 
institutions, commercial structures, and commercial banks--both 
domestic and foreign--with which Ukragrotekhservis has conducted 
financial and economic activity. Only by conducting this 
comprehensive inspection, and then an expert legal and 
bookkeeping examination, can we and you establish (I do not 
doubt this!) the true motives for the attempt on Vladimir 
Bortnik's life. 
  Incidentally, Ukraine's Security Service has twice charged 
the monitoring and auditing department of Ukraine's Ministry of 
Finance to conduct a thorough inspection of the activity of 
Ukragrotekhservis and of the state and commercial structures 
connected with it. Up until now, this decision of the SBU 
[Security Service of Ukraine] has not been carried out. I intend 
to raise the question about the responsibility of officials from 
the Ministry of Finance's KRU [monitoring and auditing 
department] for the failure to implement the Law on the 
Organization and Legal Bases for Combating Organized Crime. It 
clearly states: The duty of all state structures, including the 
KRU, is to carry out rigorously the decisions of the SBU, the 
general procurator, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], and 
other subunits engaged in combating corruption and organized 
crime. 
  I will refrain from evaluating--politically, morally, and 
ethically--the strange inactivity of the KRU in this matter. I 
will, however, see to it in every way possible that the decree 
on the appointment of this inspection body be carried out by the 
Supreme Council Presidium, as was done in 1990, when the 
Presidium appointed a similar inspection agency to investigate 
the circumstances connected with the misappropriation of assets 
allocated to eliminate the consequences of the Chernobyl 
catastrophe. 
  The programs of a majority of the people's deputies contain 
quite a few correct words and vows to the voters to struggle 
resolutely against the mafia and corruption. That is why I 
nevertheless believe that my proposal to establish a Supreme 
Council investigating commission and to ensure normal conditions 
for the work of the operational investigation group's members 
will be supported. If we succeed....Lord willing! I hope and am 
confident that we will manage to bring this affair to a complete 
end, and then.... it is difficult for me to say this phrase; but 
then we will no longer talk only about the mafia and corruption 
in the highest echelons of power. The subject concerns attempts 
to destroy Ukraine economically as an independent state! 
  No matter what it costs, I will do everything to investigate 
this matter until the end. 
  [Parakhonya] On Friday, extremely serious accusations 
addressed to V. Datsyuk, the general procurator, sounded from 
the parliament rostrum. It seems to me that some of our deputies 
are simply incapable of remembering that they represent the 
first, the legislative, and not the third, the judicial, branch. 
What is more, Yu. Spizhenko, the minister of health, quoting his 
medical colleagues, reported that the police workers who 
protected V. Bortnik were drunk.... 
  [Omelchenko] Here on my table are documents: The examination 
of the policemen was conducted at the time, 31 May, by the 
on-duty medical personnel at that same emergency hospital. All 
were sober and acted in accurate compliance with instructions. I 
will say one thing: Neither Yu. Zvyahilskyy nor Yu. Spizhenko, 
who arrived during the night at the hospital where the wounded 
deputy was located, have any justifying motives. Yes, a vital 
need to send V. Bortnik abroad could have arisen (we will not 
specify--did it arise?) in order to provide him with qualified 
medical help there. However, knowing that the wounded man was 
under protection and that an investigation was being 
conducted--however, they were not able to know about this--it 
was necessary, at a minimum, to secure the permission of 
Ukraine's procurator general to see the patient. 
  [Parakhonya] Perhaps I am posing the question amateurishly; 
however, the supposition suggests itself that a concern for V. 
Bortnik's health was not the only reason for his urgent dispatch 
abroad. It looks as if something else worried the organizers of 
this trip. Was it impossible to allow the leaking of some 
information? 
  [Omelchenko] The question is not at all amateurish. You are 
looking directly at the root. I can answer--in the aspect, let 
us say, of a version. It is one of the working versions of the 
investigation. In addition, I can justify this version using 
evidence existing today. I will not do this for one simple 
reason--so as not to agitate unnecessarily public opinion about 
this criminal case. However, I promise your readers that I will 
tell everything without fail as soon as it is possible to do so 
without harming the interests of the investigation. 
  Knowing practically all aspects of this criminal case and 
everything that is occurring around it, I was again convinced 
that we vitally needed a note about Section 4 of Article 111 in 
the Constitution and Articles 27 and 28 in the law concerning 
the status of a people's deputy in Ukraine. The subject in them 
concerns a deputy's immunity. I intend to submit the question of 
the repeal of these articles to the Supreme Council session. 
  The deputy's immunity, which our people's deputies possess 
at 
all levels, no longer exists anywhere in the world. This is some 
kind of feudalism! I think that the law's propositions 
concerning who can institute proceedings against a people's 
deputy should be formulated approximately as follows: "A 
criminal case concerning a people's deputy of Ukraine can be 
instituted by the general procurator, oblast procurator, 
procurator of the cities of Kiev and Sevastopol, or persons 
acting as general procurator, procurators of the oblasts, and 
procurators given the same status as them. The criminal case 
should be heard by Ukraine's Supreme Court." Concerning deputies 
of local soviets, a criminal case against a deputy should be 
instituted by the appropriate procurator--rayon, city, or 
oblast--and heard by the oblast court. 
  That is all! There should not be any other limitations in 
the 
criminal procedure or any special procedure for instituting 
criminal proceedings against deputies. 
  [Parakhonya] However, you see, provocations, squaring of 
accounts, etc., are possible against deputies (and against you 
also--no, against you in particular). 
  [Omelchenko] If a deputy does not break the law, does not 
commit crimes, and is not connected with the mafia and corrupted 
commercial structures, banks, etc., he has no reason to fear 
anything or to be apprehensive--the more so since a procurator, 
before instituting criminal proceedings against a people's 
deputy, will weigh and recheck everything a thousand times--the 
responsibility is too great. 
  I consider the problem of a deputy's immunity to be the 
Rubicon which our Supreme Council simply must cross. 
  [Parakhonya] I very much doubt that parliament will take 
this 
step. 
  [Omelchenko] Let the deputies recall their campaign 
promises, 
programs, and vows to fight against the mafia and corruption. 
They are able to carry them out and show precisely how the 
question of a deputy's immunity will be solved. It will become a 
kind of litmus-paper that will immediately reveal who is who. 
  [Parakhonya] You will insist on a role-call vote? 
  [Omelchenko] Simply! 
  [Parakhonya] It seems that the case of V. Bortnik has shown 
how vulnerable our deputy's immunity is. By no means do I have 
in mind only the fact that a people's deputy with his immunity 
can be wounded, just like any other ordinary mortal. Certain 
forces behind the scenes can also direct his actions. The fact 
of under what conditions and how the question was decided to 
send V. Bortnik urgently to Vienna testifies to the sweeping 
capabilities of the "opposite side." The work of the 
investigating operational group and the Commission on Matters To 
Combat Organized Crime and Corruption will encounter (is already 
encountering?) a certain opposition. 
  Or is this a secret? If possible, a few words about the 
operational investigating group. 
  [Omelchenko] Let us begin with the latter. The group 
contains 
high class professionals from the general procurator's office, 
SBU, and MVD--investigators and operational workers. Working 
indefatigably, the investigators work approximately 16-18 hours 
a day. The operational people work even more; the week that 
passed after the day of the crime was practically a week without 
sleep for them. 
  Now about the opposition. However strange it may seem, one 
must render it its due. Anonymous "well-wishers" somehow know 
the home telephone numbers of the members of the group that is 
investigating this criminal case. Recommendations, so to say, 
"not to dig deeply" were first addressed to them. Next, 
blackmail was set in motion in the case--promises to publish 
some devastating material that would compromise the group's 
leadership. Threats of physical violence have also already been 
heard. 
  [Parakhonya] You see, the lads in the investigating 
operational group have wives, children.... 
  [Omelchenko] That is why the group's members were forced to 
take definite actions to protect the life and health of their 
relatives and relations and, naturally, take a number of 
necessary steps to establish conditions--even if only 
minimal--for the group's normal functioning. 
  [Parakhonya] In your view, how will the situation develop? 
  [Omelchenko] It will be possible to see a great deal after 
parliament adopts a decision to establish a Supreme Council 
investigating commission, and when a decision has been taken at 
the Presidium level, to conduct a thorough financial and 
economic review of Ukragrotekhservis and the structures 
connected with it. At that time, events will begin to develop 
swiftly. 
  [Parakhonya] Are you confident that an affair of this scope 
will be a unique one in your work as chairman of the 
parliamentary commission? 
  [Omelchenko] It is not the attempt itself on the deputy's 
life but that which is connected with this case that does not at 
all surprise me. This case is one of an extremely average level, 
since today corruption and the mafia clans have actually eaten 
away at the state. The people have probably lost faith already 
in the ability to conquer this terrible evil. One would like to 
believe that this Supreme Council is able to do something 
useful. Would that God would let us establish a special subunit 
in the SBU to fight corruption, which has still not been 
established, including through the fault of the former Supreme 
Council. It is no less urgent to adopt--even if only the first 
ones--laws regarding the struggle against corruption and 
organized crime and to give a legal definition of the concepts: 
"mafia," "corruption," and "organized crime." The Supreme 
Council planned to do this last year; however.... 
  [Parakhonya] You said that people have probably already lost 
faith in the fact that it is possible to defeat the mafia and 
corruption. You and those who are engaged in investigations 
possess information that is not even dreamed about in a terrible 
dream; have you preserved this faith? 
  [Omelchenko] That is a very difficult question.... Sometimes 
workers engaged in combating corruption and organized crime 
remind one of Don Quixote or fanatics who continue their 
struggle despite any logic. They beat their heads against the 
wall and the result is often nothing.... 
  I will speak frankly. Previously, specialists in this field 
at times left the work because the pay did not suit them. I do 
not wish to judge them; each has his own problems and living 
circumstances. However, young people are now leaving us at times 
for quite different moral and ethical motives: The work is 
dangerous and risky and is running free. To beat one's head 
against a wall is a dishonorable occupation. 
  I want to emphasize once again: The adoption of radical and 
very decisive legal measures to combat this terrible evil is 
necessary--of course, with the parallel adoption of economic 
laws. However, without legal ones, economic laws (you see, where 
is corruption rooted?--in the economy) will not work. If we do 
not repeal a deputy's immunity, one can give up the struggle 
against corruption and the mafia as a lost cause.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko: "Once Again, a Struggle for an </F>
Independent State: Opposition Attempting To Unite"] 
  [Text] At a news conference in Kiev of the "Ukraine" 
Association of Democratic Forces, its newly elected leader, 
Dmitriy Pavlychko, the well-known poet and deputy of the former 
Ukrainian parliament, affirmed for the umpteenth time the defeat 
of the national democratic forces at the parliamentary elections 
and called on all nationally aware politicians for unity lest 
this situation be repeated at the forthcoming presidential 
elections. In Pavlychko's opinion, the reasons for the defeat of 
the Ukrainian national democrats were the most profound economic 
crisis, the nostalgia that it has caused for the former times, 
inadequate political experience, and, of course, the absence of 
unity, which enabled the ruling nomenklatura "to heap the blame 
for what has happened on the national democrats." Dmitriy 
Pavlychko declared: "The very idea of Ukraine's independence is 
being called in question today. We are once again in a phase of 
struggle for an independent state." In his opinion, the national 
democrats should in the current situation renounce the 
protracted euphoria from the acquisition of state independence 
and attempt to link the idea of statehood with that of social 
justice, since antimarket views prevail in the present Supreme 
Council, and members of parliament are adopting a policy of a 
return to the command-administrative system. Pavlychko agreed 
that it is, indeed, today necessary for regulation of the 
economy on the part of the state, but that this should be done 
in the interests of the poorest strata of society and that "we 
cannot return to the socialist capitalism under which we lived 
for 70 years." 
  Dmitriy Pavlychko cited the two principal most important 
tasks of the democratic camp: victory at the parliamentary 
by-elections for 112 people's deputies of Ukraine on 24 July and 
concerted support for the progressive candidate at the upcoming 
presidential elections. Pavlychko announced that the "Ukraine" 
Association has been able to agree on and put forward 73 united 
democratic candidates and that he would be pleased if only half 
of these were to win. In the opinion of Vladimir Klimchuk, 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine, the 
parliamentary by-elections are today the democrats' most 
important tasks, since it is they that can, if not alter the 
correlation of forces in parliament in favor of the democrats, 
then in any event, preserve for them the opportunity to ensure 
that the left cannot have in parliament a constitutional 
majority and cannot adopt a constitution and laws to their 
advantage. 
  Apropos the presidential elections, Pavlychko said that the 
leaders of national democratic parties and movements had 
attempted to unite and had created a coordinating council of 
chairmen of political parties, which is to define a common 
approach to the presidential campaign and determine the 
candidate to be supported. At the same time, on the other hand, 
the leaders of the democratic association affirmed that they had 
been unable thus far to formulate a common strategy and tactics 
at the elections and had not settled on a single candidate. 
According to Dmitriy Pavlychko, the democrats should proceed, 
meanwhile, from the fact that they must under no circumstances 
"support regression" and should, consequently, oppose, in his 
opinion, the anti-Ukraine and antimarket programs of former 
Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma and the present speaker of 
parliament, Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the Socialist Party. In 
Pavlychko's opinion, democrats should support the "lesser of the 
two evils." Dmitriy Pavlychko declared that this candidate today 
is Leonid Kravchuk, who alone could worthily confront both 
Leonid Kuchma and Aleksandr Moroz, uphold Ukraine's 
independence, and be a predictable politician. "We are today at 
the Rubicon: Either you are for Ukraine or you are against it," 
Pavlychko summed up, and added that the ideal situation would be 
the distribution of the highest offices of state among all the 
dominant political forces and their leaders. Specifically, 
Pavlychko believes, Kravchuk would be acceptable as president, 
and Moroz, as speaker of parliament, and Ivan Plyushch and other 
presidential contestants would join a government of reforms and 
all-Ukraine accord. 
  As far as Ukrainian society itself is concerned, it is, as 
before, in a state of social apathy. This may be confirmed, for 
example, by the data of a sociological survey of 1,200 persons 
from eight eastern and southern oblasts of Ukraine and the 
Republic of Crimea. The poll was conducted by the Democratic 
Initiatives center. Only 41 percent of those polled recalled 
that on 1 December 1991 they had supported Ukraine's 
independence. Also of interest are the responses to the direct 
question: "If you had once again to participate in a referendum 
on questions of the state independence of Ukraine, what would 
your choice be now?" Forty-seven percent believe that they would 
oppose Ukraine's independence, 24 would respond positively, 12 
percent would not take part in the referendum at all, and 17 
percent did not know. Such lamentable data after two and 
one-half years of Ukraine's independence are, according to the 
sociological poll, the result of the ill-conceived policy of the 
national leadership. Some 37 percent of those polled cited 
together with other factors as the main cause of the crisis the 
reluctance or incapacity of the leadership of Ukraine for 
implementing market economic reforms. Among the other causes, 
citing three alternative answers, 34 percent of respondents 
consider the main cause of the crisis the collapse of the Union; 
28 percent, the absence in Ukraine of strong and authoritative 
leaders; 25 percent, the absence of a realistic program of an 
escape from the crisis; 26 percent, the incompetence and 
irresponsibility of the government bureaucracy; 28 percent, the 
activity of the mafia; and 14 percent, the lack of discipline 
and order in society. 
  Only 23 percent of respondents believe that Ukraine could 
emerge from the crisis in the coming years; 39 percent are sure 
that it can overcome the crisis in the coming years, and 21 
percent are sure that Ukraine can never emerge from the crisis; 
a further 15 percent did not know. 
  Those polled were just as pessimistic about the coming 
presidential elections. Twenty percent declared that they would 
not be voting at all; 42 percent had not decided for whom they 
would vote; 21 percent gave as their choice former Prime 
Minister Leonid Kuchma; 7 percent, the present president, Leonid 
Kravchuk; 4 percent, the socialist Aleksandr Moroz the speaker 
of parliament; 3 percent, Volodymyr Lanovyy, former deputy prime 
minister for economic reform; and 2 percent, former speaker Ivan 
Plyushch. Responding to a question as to what Ukraine needs to 
do first and foremost, 41 percent of those polled cited the 
assurance of government social safeguards for the working 
people; 32 percent, the restoration of the USSR; 26 percent, the 
imposition of order in society by any methods, power methods 
included; 22 percent, support for enterprise; 21 percent, a 
return to the socialist model of development with state 
regulation of the economy and the system of distribution; 25 
percent, the introduction of Russian as a second official 
language; and only 15 percent, a strengthening of the Ukrainian 
state. 
  Evaluating the activity of the political parties, 52 percent 
of respondents declared that the parties are engaged exclusively 
in a struggle for power; 8 percent, that parties are an 
essential component of the democratic development of society; 7 
percent, that they express the interests of the mafia; and 6 
percent each declared that the parties contribute to the 
emergence of conflicts or that they defend people's interests. 
The rest of those polled had difficulty answering the question 
on the role of the party in society. 
  Responding to a question concerning the prospects of 
Crimea's 
existence, 48 percent of those polled replied that they would 
like to see it as an inalienable part of Ukraine; 16 percent, 
that Crimea should be an independent state and 10 percent, that 
it should become a part of Russia; 7 percent proposed other 
options, and 18 percent did not know. According to the data of 
this survey, the people of Ukraine are, as before, in a state of 
political apathy. Only 32 percent of those polled are prepared 
to take part personally in strikes with political or economic 
demands; 38 percent agree to put up with any material 
difficulties provided that calm and civil peace be preserved in 
the country; 14 percent of those polled responded that the 
political struggle did not concern them; and 16 percent did not 
know.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Andreyeva under the rubric </F>
"Viewpoint": "Patches on the Wet Asphalt. Untimely Reflections 
Evoked by L. Kravchuk's Visit to Lvov"] 
  [Text] To exploit the theme of painting the grass green and 
other "Potemkinian" actions in preparation for the arrival of 
important guests is banal to say the least. And to clean 
house--your own personal one or our larger one--if someone has 
been invited there is nice, and the citizens of Lvov could only 
stand to gain from building up a pleasant square and cleaning up 
the area near the Grushevskiy Monument. It is simply that I 
recalled a line which seemed symbolic. They patched up the 
asphalt on the streets through which the important guest was to 
pass. They put hot patches on the pavement which was wet after 
the rain. Specialists say that this method of mending is 
pointless, because it will not last. The same sense of 
necessity-hopelessness arose after the festive "commitment" of 
the Halychyna to presidential candidate Kravchuk. 
  Gathered in the Polytechnical Institute, as they say in such 
cases, were the community of the oblast. The main thing heard 
there was an unequivocal promise from the lips of the 
president's representative, Stepan Davymuka: The authorities, 
the political organizations, and the majority of the population 
of the Lvov area support presidential candidate Leonid 
Makarovych. No objections followed. Moreover, one of the most 
influential, as far as influence on the rank-and-file voter 
goes, forces, the Greco-Catholic church, through the lips of 
Bishop of Zborovskiy Mikhail, declared support for Kravchuk. 
True, a veiled condition was imposed--that he complete the 
process of rehabilitation of the Ukrainian Greco-Catholic 
Church, which had been crucified and banned by Stalin. The year 
on the calendar is not 1989, and it will not be difficult to 
meet that condition. 
  Kravchuk was never one of the favorites in the Lvov area. 
Moreover, Lvov politicians seem to have gathered points for the 
opposition. And a week or two ago the breakdown looked 
different: They were clearly inclined to support I. Plyushch. 
When the crowd flowed out of the Polytechnical Institute onto 
the street, I forced my way through to the chief of the Lvov 
Rukh organization, Yuriy Klyuchkovskiy, to ask him a question: 
In his view, did the president's representative have the right 
to speak so unequivocally "on behalf of and on instructions 
from" ? "Let me put it this way, he did not say anything so 
terrible," Klyuchkovskiy answered. "Yes, Lvov Rukh members 
support Kravchuk. This is in line with the opinion of the Rukh 
high council: to make the decision independently in the local 
areas concerning support of the candidate for the post of 
president. To adopt a decision which will help block the 
advancement of Kuchma and Moroz to the high position." The chief 
of the secretariat of New Wave [preceding two words in Ukrainian 
in original], Yuriy Shveda, put it this way: "We also support 
Kravchuk. In opposition to Kuchma's pro-Russian position and 
Moroz's pro-communist position, which are dangerous for Ukraine. 
Incidentally, we are not withdrawing our complaints against the 
current and potential president--failure to conduct economic 
reforms and his personnel policy. But Plyushch? Well, anything 
can happen, but in our view, Ivan Stepanovych lost the first 
round in parliament. We see a real standoff between Kuchma and 
Kravchuk." 
  I wanted very much to learn the opinion about what was 
taking 
place of Halychina's favorite, the clear winner in the last 
presidential elections in the West, the eternal opponent and 
severe critic of Kravchuk, V. Chornovol [as published]. I met 
him on an empty street in the center--everyone had gone to the 
Grushevskiy Monument, where the president was just about to 
appear. Vyacheslav Maksimovych, judging from everything, was 
headed there too. I am probably exaggerating and transferring my 
creative-opposition sadness to others. But....on this street, 
swept clean for the holiday for "welcoming the sovereign," I did 
not approach this exhausted person. Our conversation took place 
later, in the evening, in the packed theater imeni Mariya 
Zankovetskaya. 
  But for now....you know, it is possible to get into a 
"shotgun wedding" in all kinds of ways. But the Lvov authorities 
were actually gleefully kicking up their heels. Respect for the 
legitimate president is one thing, but the phrase spoken even 
after the business conversations, the phrase of that same S. 
Davymuka, in my opinion, caused even the main hero to cringe. 
And so with a coquettish grin and almost a tear of emotion: "We 
give you, Leonid Makarovych, the strictest possible instruction: 
Win, please!" 
  The people love holidays. And "sovereigns." It is easy to 
forgive them everything--for the holiday. The people gathered 
there to see the president's earlobe, his shoe. The sun was 
shining. It bathed the monument to the tragic president, who was 
destroyed by the UNR [Ukrainian People's Republic]--Mikhail 
Grushevskiy. The chorus sang "Chervona Kalina." The president 
listened. On these cobblestones these same Lvov residents who 
are actually and naturally devoted to the idea of state 
independence five years ago were beaten with the militia's clubs 
for singing "Chervona Kalina." At that time Kravchuk was 
battling it out with Rukh for the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of Ukraine. 
  Enough sentiments. Leonid Kravchuk can count on the support 
and love of the people of Halychyna if only because he has 
unequivocally declared and repeated in Lvov: There is no turning 
back. Ukraine can only be independent, only an integrated state. 
Politicians, including those in the opposition, also like the 
predictability of the actions of this president: A known 
"disease" is always better than an unknown one. Here are the 
words of Vyacheslav Chornovol [as published]: "The situation has 
developed in such a way that it is necessary to support 
Kravchuk. But not without reservation, it is necessary to make 
several ultimatums. I am afraid of having Kuchma as president. 
He wants to make us subordinate to the military-industrial 
complex not only of Ukraine, but also of the former Union. Yes, 
I am also afraid of having Kravchuk as president, but less so. 
We already know which "buttons" to push in order to influence 
this president in one way or another. But as Chornovil [as 
published] the voter, I give my vote to Volodymyr Lanovyy." 
  There is no point in listing past sins. What do they have to 
do with present sins? Kuchma, of course, would put Ukraine in 
the hammerlock of the "older brother." The socialist Moroz would 
put us back where we were before. In addition to everything 
else, neither one is likely to lead the movement along the path 
of radical economic reforms. 
  And Leonid Kravchuk? Let us hope that he will maintain 
relative political stability, that through his flexibility and a 
certain amount of international prestige, he will be able to 
preserve the civil peace in Ukraine and peace on its borders. 
Perhaps he will be able to be a candidate who is equally 
acceptable to the East and West. And what about the reforms? 
What about the team of those who could conduct the reforms? What 
about the need to settle (judging from everything, with jobs) 
with the left and the nomenklatura? After all, an effective 
opposition is being formed, it will roll up its sleeves and 
start looking for the "buttons".... 
  There was another interesting pre-holiday incident. Two days 
before the monument was uncovered, at about 12 midnight, I saw 
the sculpture bare, without its traditional cover, and an 
alarmed group of militia officers on the square at night. Toward 
morning the monument was covered as it should be. I do not know 
how reliable this is, but an authorized person told me in a 
personal conversation: That night the cover was simply ripped 
off. 
  Aleksandr Blok. The poem "The Twelve." The year 1917. 
Remember the text? The old woman is standing in front of an 
immense banner and grieving: Many mothers were tormented, 
saying, "So many foot bindings could be made for the boys....But 
everyone was unshod and unclothed."

Financial-Credit Support in Forming State Food Resources in 
1994-1995"] 
  [Text] Considering the state of financial-credit support 
that has taken shape in the Ukrainian agro-industrial complex, 
the necessity of forming state food resources for 1994-1995, and 
also the proposals of the Ukrainian people's deputies on these 
matters, I decree: 
  1. Before 1 July 1994, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers 
will examine the question of price formation in the 
agro-industrial complex, starting from the need to observe 
optimal parity between prices for agricultural output and raw 
materials and industrial output. 
  2. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, in agreement with the 
Ukrainian National Bank, will grant, on a priority basis, in 
June-September 1994, special-purpose credits to enterprises and 
organizations of the agro-industrial complex against state 
contracts and orders for delivery of agricultural output to 
state food resources and for preliminary payment for animal 
husbandry products within the limits of the possibilities of 
putting a primary credit emission into circulation for this 
period. 
  The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, in agreement with the 
Ukrainian National Bank, will within 10 days direct 1.7 trillion 
karbovantsy, taken from the return of stabilization resources, 
to enterprises of the meat, dairy, canning, food, and other 
sectors of industry that process agricultural output and raw 
materials to make payments to the commodity producers of the 
agro-industrial complex for agricultural output and raw 
materials purchased. 
  3. It is established that, in 1994-1995, the Ukraine 
joint-stock commercial agro-industrial bank will perform state 
functions associated with credit, settlement, and currency 
services to the enterprises and organizations of the 
agro-industrial complex in their activities aimed at generating 
state resources of foodstuffs. Procedures for performing these 
functions will be established by the Ukrainian Ministry of 
Finance in coordination with the Ukrainian National Bank. 
  4. It is established that, beginning on 15 June 1994, 
commercial banks will direct 10 percent of their mobilized 
credit resources to credit for enterprises and organizations of 
the agro-industrial complex and to purchase certificates of 
deposit of the Ukrainian National Bank. 
  It is established that for commercial banks that direct 
mobilized credit resources to credit for enterprises and 
organizations of the agro-industrial complex and to purchase 
certificates of deposit of the Ukrainian National Bank, the 
income tax rate for the part of income received from these 
credits and certificates of deposit will be lowered to 11 
percent. 
  Credit at an annual interest rate of 30 percent will be 
granted to enterprises and organizations of the agro-industrial 
complex to finance state agrarian programs. 
  The difference between the rate at which credit resources 
are 
attracted (not greater than the discount rate of the Ukrainian 
National Bank) and the 30-percent rate for credit use will be 
compensated for from the Ukrainian State Budget. 
  During preparation of proposals to specify the indicators of 
the 1994 Ukrainian State Budget, the Ukrainian Ministry of 
Finance will envision the appropriations necessary for this. 
  The Ukrainian Ministry of Finance, with the participation of 
the Ukrainian National Bank, will within 10 days develop and 
ratify the procedure for forming and using mobilized credit 
resources, keeping records of the commercial bank income 
received in this, and applying tax to such income. 
  5. The Ukrainian National Bank, with the participation of 
commercial banks and the appropriate ministries and departments, 
will within 10 days define and institute a mechanism, mandatory 
for commercial banks and their debtors, for transferring 
indebtedness on loans granted out of credit resources that the 
state has granted to agricultural commodity producers and 
enterprises of the processing and mixed feed industries to the 
purchasers of their output. 
  6. Before 1 July 1994, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers 
will see that procurement and processing enterprises and 
organizations are given 50-percent advance payments for 
agricultural commodity producers against the state contract, 
including advances for seed for agricultural crops and for 
pedigreed livestock, and they will envision the appropriations 
needed for this during preparation of proposals to specify the 
indicators of the 1994 Ukrainian State Budget. 
  7. The Ukrainian National Bank will establish a most favored 
status for commercial banks that take part in carrying out 
priority agrarian programs. 
  Agricultural enterprises and organizations will make 
extensive use of the credits received against the security of 
their output. In this connection, one exception will be 
established for them in payment of the state fee for registering 
security; it will be 0.3 percent of the value of the property 
used as security, but not more than 5 million karbovantsy. 
  8. It is established that enterprises of the wholesale and 
retail networks, regardless of their form of ownership and 
including consumer cooperative enterprises, will use all of the 
earnings they receive, with the exception of the trade margin, 
from the sale of agricultural output and food bought from the 
producers of Ukrainian agro-industrial output exclusively for 
settling accounts with those producers. If these earnings are 
used for other purposes, the tax inspectorates will impose an 
indisputable penalty of three times the amount used improperly, 
to be paid to the local budget. 
  9. It is established that wholesale and retail trade 
enterprises, regardless of their form of ownership and including 
consumer cooperative enterprises, must pay a fine of 3 percent 
of the total payment to suppliers of agricultural output, raw 
material, and food and a 3-percent payment to the local budget 
for each day payment is overdue after a three-day period, unless 
a larger penalty is envisioned by agreement. 
  The Ukrainian National Bank will institute a procedure for 
collecting this fine from its clients who violate payment 
discipline by a nonacceptance withdrawal. 
  10. The Ukrainian State Committee on Material Reserves will 
put an additional 90,000 tonnes of animal fat and 30,000 tonnes 
of meat into the state reserve in June-August 1994. 
  The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers will ensure timely 
payment 
for this output and envision the means for this in the state 
budget. 
  11. The government of the Republic of Crimea and the oblast, 
Kiev, and Sevastopol state administrations, with the 
participation of the Ukrainian Ministry of Agriculture and Food 
and other interested ministries and departments, will ensure 
that, before 10 June 1994, the accounts of agricultural 
commodity producers and enterprises of the processing industry 
with organizations of wholesale and retail trade, regardless of 
forms of ownership and including consumer cooperatives, for 
agricultural output and processed food products delivered as of 
1 June 1994 are reconciled. 
  The purchasers of agricultural output and processed food 
products are obligated to complete payment for the output 
received before 15 June 1994. 
  Article 9 of the present edict will apply to enterprises who 
do not ensure timely payment for output received. 
  12. In connection with the present Ukrainian presidential 
edict, Edict No. 458, dated 15 October 1993, entitled "Payments 
for Deliveries of Food and Agricultural Output" is declared 
repealed. 
  13. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers and the Ukrainian 
National Bank will bring normative enactments published earlier 
into line with the present edict. 
  14. The present edict goes into force on the day it is 
signed. 
  [Signed] President of Ukraine L. Kravchuk 
  City of Kiev, 2 June 1994

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "Business: Energy </F>
Supplies": "Nuclear Electric Power Stations Are Ukraine's 
Fastest Developing Energy Source"] 
  [Text] Despite the post-Chernobyl wave of protests in 
Ukraine against the exploitation of nuclear electric power 
stations [AES] and the development of nuclear power as such, the 
latter remains the most effective energy source in the world. No 
one in the world is giving up the energy produced by nuclear 
power stations, and Ukraine is no exception to this. In 1993, 
Ukraine's AES produced 32.7% of the total volume of 
electricity 
generated by the country's electric power stations. From the 
standpoint of production effectiveness, the figure "32.7" can be 
regarded as a unique achievement, for as recently as 1990 this 
indicator measured only 25.5%. 
  Understandably, a prolonged energy crisis makes it 
impossible 
to be overly particular regarding the choice of electric power 
sources, and it is for that reason that the government will 
never renounce the services of the nuclear power engineers at 
this time. A clear demonstration of the government's position on 
this issue was the visit on 27 May of the president and the 
acting prime minister of Ukraine to the Chernobyl AES, during 
which Leonid Kravchuk showed unusual interest in the methods of 
measuring radiation both at the Chernobyl AES and in the 
surrounding area. It also became clear after this visit that the 
Chernobyl AES would not be shut down in the near future (no 
matter how much many representatives of the relevant 
international organizations might want this). That is the only 
explanation for the president's promise to the residents of 
Slavutych near Chernobyl to build a 100-unit apartment building 
in the city using government funds appropriated for this purpose. 
  On the other hand, the expansion of the production 
capacities 
of Ukraine's nuclear power plants in recent years also means 
that the load of the AES has increased, thereby increasing the 
theoretical probability of the occurrence of unexpected 
incidents at these stations. This is the other side of the coin, 
and control of this aspect must be the first order of priority. 
How to do this is up to the experts. As to the numerical 
analysis of the performance of Ukraine's electricity producers, 
the results are as follows: 
  Of the 75.2 MWh of energy produced by nuclear electric power 
stations, 27.5 MWh were produced by the Zaporizhzhya AES, 11.8 
MWh by the Rivne AES, 5.8 MWh by the Khmelnytskyy AES, 12.6 MWh 
by the Chernobyl AES, and 17.5 by the Southern Ukrainian AES. 
The most powerful thermal electric power stations TES today are 
those in Zaporizhzhya, Vuhlehirsk, Kryvyy Rih, and Burshtyn. 
  The production of electric power began to decline in 1991 
synchronously with the downturn in industrial output: the number 
of megawatts of electric power produced equals the amount of 
energy consumed by industrial customers. The inability to sell 
noncompetitive Ukrainian production because of its too high 
power-output ratio was the reason for the protracted idling of 
enterprises to conserve electric power. In 1993, according to 
the Ministry of Energy and Electrification, Ukraine exported 2.7 
MWh of electric power as against the period up to 1990, when 
annual exports amounted to nearly 30 MW. 
  According to Vasyl Protsenko, deputy chief of the 
administration of the Ministry of Energy and Electrification, 
the sharp decrease in the export of electric power from Ukraine 
was due to the production of electric power for Western 
countries at a loss while its price dropped: the purchase price 
of one kilowatt of energy fell from from 5.1 to 2.3 cents. The 
production cost of one kW of Ukrainian electric power amounts to 
2.55 cents. 
  The Ministry of Energy and Electrification predicts a 
continuing decrease in electric power production in 1994. The 
state order for the production of energy by combined electric 
power and heat generating plants TETs amounts to 134 billion 
kWh, but in reality no more than 113.5 billion kWh will be 
produced. The production of electric power by hydroelectric 
power stations [HES] will decrease in 1994 to 9.46 MWh, and by 
nuclear electric power stations [AES] to 70 MWh. One of the 
reasons for the predicted decline in the production of 
electricity, apart from a decrease in industrial consumption, is 
a shortage of fuel needed to produce electric power.

<H5>  DESPITE THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS, COAL, </H5>
MAZUT, AND GAS REMAIN THE STRATEGIC FUELS FOR THE PRODUCERS OF 
ELECTRIC POWER IN UKRAINE 
  The total volume of energy resources consumed to run the 
power generators at electric power stations reached 55.6 million 
metric tons of equivalent units in 1993, of which coal accounted 
for 26.2 million metric tons of nominal units (44%), 
mazut for 
6.5 (11%), gas for 23.1 (38.8%), and water power 
for 3.7 
(6.2%). In physical terms, the amount of coal consumed 
was 42.9 
million metric tons, mazut -- 4.8 million metric tons, and gas 
-- 20.2 billion cubic meters. 
  According to Vasyl Protsenko, the deputy chief of the 
administration of the Ministry of Energy and Electrification, in 
1993 Ukraine imported 6 million metric tons of coal, mainly from 
Russia. Forecasts for this year estimate that only one million 
metric tons of coal will be imported. As expected, the main 
reason for this decrease in the volume of coal imports is a 
shortage of funds. Consequently, the predicted shortage of coal 
in Ukraine for this year will reach 9.3 million metric tons. 
  The shortage of mazut in 1994 is expected to reach 2.9 
million metric tons. Compared with 1990, when the annual demand 
for mazut was 18 million metric tons, the current level of 
consumption has dropped to 3.8 million metric tons, because 
50% 
of Ukraine's power station units are not operating. 
  During the summer, when, as a rule, electric power 
consumption drops 30%, electric power stations, for the 
most 
part, use mazut and gas as fuel, thus creating a reserve of coal 
for the winter ranging in amounts from 800,000 to one million 
metric tons. 
  But the fuel shortage is already creating a potentially 
dangerous situation in the electric power system (in particular, 
the reduction of the frequency in the network below 49.5 Hertz) 
and threatens to result in the total collapse of Ukraine's power 
system. The Ministry of Energy and Electrification is solving 
the problem by disconnecting some consumers from the general 
network. Even now, close to 3,000 enterprises are disconnected 
every day from the power system. 
  Last year, nuclear electric power stations used nearly 24 
million metric tons of equivalent fuel and produced 32.7 percent 
of the total electric power generated in Ukraine.

<H5>  THE FINANCIAL STATE OF THE SECTOR: ELECTRIC ENERGY CONSUMERS </H5>
COULD NOT CARE LESS THAT THE MINISTRY OF ENERGY AND 
ELECTRIFICATION IS BANKRUPT The financial relations 
between the supplier of electric power and its consumers are the 
main feature characterizing the financial state of the electric 
power industry. Today these relations are in a state of crisis, 
which promises to be of long duration. 
  According to Ivan Mahda, deputy minister of energy and 
electrification of Ukraine, his ministry is now totally 
bankrupt. To some extent, the financial collapse of the Ministry 
of Energy and Electrification has been brought about by 
consumers -- enterprises that pay back only 50% of what 
they 
owe daily. The principal consumers of electric power in Ukraine 
are listed in Table 2. In 1993, they received 187.9 MWh of 
power, while the electric power stations used 16.8 MWh for their 
own needs and 22.5 MWh were lost due to over heating in the 
transmission lines. 
  Consumers are not paying the Ministry of Energy and 
Electrification what they owe, and, judging by the steady 
decline of production in Ukraine, they will not do so in the 
near future. At the same time, Alfred Turos, the chief of the 
administration of the Ministry of Energy and Electrification, 
reports that government credits issued at the end of March to 
the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Machinebuilding, 
Defense Industrial Complex, and Converstion for settling the 
debts owed by their enterprises for energy supplies were not 
used for this purpose. 
  But even if consumers were to pay off their full debt to the 
supplier, which totalled 9.5 trillion karbovantsi at the 
beginning of May, the financial crisis at the Ministry of Energy 
and Electrification would not be completely solved. The reason 
is simple: the Ministry of Energy and Electrification owes its 
consumers 9.8 trillion karbovantsi, including 1.525 trillion for 
coal, 1.469 trillion for mazut, and 1.952 trillion karbovantsi 
for gas.

<H5>  THE SECTOR'S PRODUCTION POTENTIAL IN MAY 1994 </H5>
  The base power load required by Ukraine's industrial 
consumers is carried by nuclear and thermal electric power 
stations. Hydroelectric power stations are put in service during 
peak hours of the day in order to prevent the frequency in the 
system from falling below 49.5 Hertz. 
  Today, the power industry run by the Ministry of Energy and 
Electrification is comprised of 294 enterprises, including 42 
electric power stations and 88 enterprises in the electric and 
thermal power systems. 
  Consumers are supplied with electric power by 615 regional 
electric systems, including 493 rural regional systems. 
  The total length of overhead and cable electric transmission 
lines [LEP] measures 1,014,000 kilometers, of which 951,604 km 
are overhead and 62,736 km are cable lines. The total length of 
high-voltage transmission lines (800 kW) measures 247 km. The 
total length of overhead electric transmission lines (750 kW) 
measures 4,081 km. 
  There are 2,047,000 transformer substations with a total 
capacity of 197,062 MVA.

<F P=106> [Article: "The Dniester Area: A Front Without a Front Line. </F>
There Is a Clear Sky Over Moscow -- for the Time Being...."] 
  [Text] The Dniester area is a corner of paradise. 
Thirty-degree heat, freshened by the wind from the Dniester. 
Early cherries and strawberries, masses of cucumbers, tomatoes 
and all sorts of vegetables, at prices that are absurd by 
Russian standards. The beautiful girls in short skirts attract 
the gaze of the men around them like a magnet. 
  Peace 
  The war seems to be a thing of the past. Only the 
gravestones 
in the cemeteries in Bendery and Dubossary and the modest graves 
right on the streets remind us of what happened here in 1992. 
Then, at the time of the "summer military campaign," as 
officials say, they laid to rest for eternity over 600 young 
men, and 4,000 Dniester area inhabitants were maimed and wounded. 
  Since the war, begun exactly a day after the decision of the 
Moldavian [Moldovan] Parliament on peaceful settlement of the 
territorial conflict with the Dniester area, the PMR [Dniester 
Moldavian Republic] residents have no very warm feelings toward 
the Mircea Snegur country. The independence in hand, won with 
Kalashnikov, is sacred. An independence so far unrecognized by 
the world community. 
  The possibility of the renewal of military conflict, despite 
the negotiations which have been going on with Moldavia 
[Moldova], with Russia as mediator, for almost two years now, is 
not ruled out. Moldavia is suddenly strengthening its Armed 
Forces. The PMR is hurriedly forming its power structures. 
  The number of armed military men, special forces and state 
security workers in Tiraspol is not a happy sight for a peaceful 
person. According to our rough estimates -- we simply could get 
no official information on this score -- the Dniester power 
structures number close to 8,000-10,000 people, for a total PMR 
population of 700,000. If one adds to this the 14th Russian 
Army, stationed in Tiraspol, which by our calculations 
constitutes anywhere from 12,000-13,000 persons, the armed 
readiness of the region can easily take first place over other 
similar spots. 
  The point, however, is not so much in the actual number of 
people in camouflage. During the war, 15,000 barrels -- from 
pistols to grenade launchers -- were seized from the 14th 
Russian Army. Commander Aleksandr Lebed, on one side, and the 
Dniester state authorities, on the other, signed an "Act of 
Seizure." The fate of most of the weapons is unknown. 
  Meanwhile, the "material" existence of the ordinary, so to 
speak, peaceful inhabitants of the Dniester Republic does not 
evoke pleasant emotions: most of them receive below the 
subsistence level. The average wage is somewhere around 120,000 
"dniestrofiki," in the official version bearing the name 
"suvoriki" (stamps with a picture of Aleksandr Suvorov are glued 
on the old Soviet money). One of our Russian rubles equals 6-6.5 
Dniester ones. 
  Poverty particularly graces the pensioners, who have a 
pension with a maximum of 80,000 "suvoriki," with the average 
subsistence minimum being 150,000. People with the physical and 
mental potentials, and moreover -- links with the criminal world 
(which, incidentally, long ago divided the Dniester land into 
spheres of influence) engage either in so-called commerce, or in 
general in things that have little to do with the law. 
Homicides, theft, rackets, kidnapping people with a view to 
ransoming them to the PMR -- are the order of the day. 
  In this situation too, over a period of actually 
one-and-a-half years in the Dniester area, a conflict has been 
flaring up, so far, thank God, on a verbal level, between the 
leaders of the 14th Army and the headquarters of the Tiraspol 
Garrison on the one hand, and the local state authorities on the 
other. This is a conflict which at present has a good chance of 
turning into armed confrontation. 
<H8>  Ministers with Double Last Names </H8>
  The internal enemies of the local authorities are Lt Gen 
Aleksandr Lebed, 14th Army commander, and Col Mikhail Bergman, 
Tiraspol commander. The leaders of the state authorities in 
opposition are Vadim Shevtsov, chairman of the State Security 
Committee, and President Igor Smirnov. In that precise order. 
Other representatives of the "opposing sides" naturally take 
part in the verbal "Mord-bashing." 
  The interrelations between them are so emotional that they 
are far from parliamentary formulations. There are thousands of 
people who are for both of them, though. The Dniester citizens. 
Since almost the entire staff of the 14th Army and the Tiraspol 
Military Headquarters are local residents. 
  Despite the two years that have passed since the war, 
Tiraspol resembles a typically post-front city, with signs that 
anarchy holds sway, an anarchy based on physical-firing power. 
With a mass information media very clearly marked official, 
whose methods openly resemble the "bright" repressive-stagnant 
years. It is no trouble to pick up the lies, whatever the topic. 
Lt Gen Lebed and Col Bergman can get a whole program out of 
them. The former -- in the most modest expressions, on the 
strength, apparently, of his special status, and the latter -- a 
whole string of them. The Armenian newspaper SYN OTECHESTVA and 
the television program "AsKET," reciprocate their feelings. The 
court regularly hears suits brought by local leaders against 
Mikhail Bergman -- in defense of honor and worthiness or for 
slander. For some reason, though, not once has the colonel, who 
is not loved by the authorities, been punished. In the opinion 
of the Dniester authorities, Bergman is the man who provides the 
sound for Lebed. The main arguments for public accusation of the 
colonel: he has "outlived" two army commanders, has a summer 
home and rose too quickly to the rank of colonel. De facto 
--that is all. 
  Meanwhile, the accusations coming from the mouths of the 
leaders of the Russian units are much more interesting. 
Moreover, this is not a game of cat and mouse. It is 
large-scale. Out in the open. "Do you know, where you have 
landed?" Bergman says to us. "The mafia rules in the Dniester 
area. There are a few people in the government who have been 
convicted. Aleksandr Saydakov, minister of Local Industry, has 
two counts, including one for motor vehicle theft. Vladimir 
Yemelyanov, chairman of the United Strike Committee, was 
convicted of illicit trading in state plates. The chairman of 
the State Security Committee, now Maj Gen Vadim Shevtsov (real 
last name Antyufeyev), is sought by Baltic authorities for "gay" 
affairs when he was working in agencies in Riga. There are many 
persons in the government who do not go by their real last names 
-- in addition to Shevtsov, that same Matveyev, the former 
Goncharenko, who served with Antyufeyev in Riga. There are 
former KGB and GRU workers -- a lot of them. Gudymo, the present 
minister of State Security, is on pension from organs of the 
KGB. President Smirnov is a puppet, a habitual drunkard. 
Moreover, a weak-willed one. Shevtsov has all the authority, and 
he tramples the people under him: he makes compromises with many 
people. For example, Smirnov's son, a State Security captain, 
drives around in a car worth $48,000. The godfather of the local 
mafia also gets around the same way. Everyone knows about this, 
you realize, ours is a small town...." 
  The facts about Bergman have really turned out to be common 
knowledge. Vadim Shevtsov, in a private interview with us, 
stated that he had not just one, but five last names: "I was an 
operations worker." The change in last name "is fully natural, 
after all, I am in hiding." As for the mafia in the government: 
"Bergman is a sick man." The convictions of the ministers -- 
well, there were some. "But after all, you can't begin life from 
scratch." Are there any former members of the special organs 
from Moscow among the republic's leaders? "You understand, after 
all, people want to protect the Dniester area." 
  The more information we learned about the "state leaders" of 
the Dniester area, the "warmer" our feelings grew. Valeriy 
Litskay, the present minister of Foreign Relations, even in 
1983, gave a signed statement to the Moldavian organs of the KGB 
on cooperation, having become an agent using the nickname Oleg. 
The minister of Foreign Affairs, as he calls himself, took this 
historic action on the basis of the fact that he "as a patriot 
of our Motherland, expresses his desire to cooperate with the 
organs of state security in the matter of ensuring the interests 
of the Soviet Union" (quotation from a statement to the KGB). 
  The personal file of another local leader -- Bolshakov, 
known 
in the organs of the KGB by the nickname of Agent Berzin, 
personally sent by Mikhail Bergman to the Dniester ministry of 
State Security, was suddenly lost in the course of a week, a 
fact which V. Luchik, procurator general of the PMR, sorrowfully 
announced. 
<H8>  Modest Crime? </H8>
  Right at the time of the war, the PMR president issued some 
very curious documents. On the seventh day of the war, 25 June 
1992, a presidential edict was issued "On Setting Up Republic 
Administration of Foreign Economic Activity." Implementation of 
the foreign economic activity of the Dniester region was handed 
over to... a limited liability company, "Tri Plyus Ko ltd," of 
the Ukrainian Republic. On the basis of which a Tiraspol branch 
of republic administration for the above-named problems was to 
be set up. Where did this currency favor to a Ukrainian firm 
come from? 
  Another document, of the postwar days, is no less 
attractive: 
the "Act of Counter-Checking the Dispatch of Railcars from the 
Rybnitsa Station by the Kvant Cooperative on 12 December 1992." 
Some 307 cars of metal, steel and wire rods, addressed to Kvant, 
arrived from the Cherepovets Metallurgical Plant. According to 
the waybills. The goods were remolded by the cooperative into a 
very cheap finished product called "arch modules" and were 
immediately dispatched to the CIS countries and Bulgaria. A very 
simple scheme for illegal sale of valuable metal. 
  Meanwhile, the power structures of the Dniester area are 
being hit with very significant mix-ups. Of 46 criminal 
investigators, 32 experienced officers "left." A whole company 
of regular officers left the Dniester Special Service Battalion. 
The other day, there was a rebellion in the Dniester, as they 
say in Tiraspol. The reason was quite unique: a few days back, 
the special service men had seized a group of one of the 
representatives of the local mafia, Stas, who was literally 
released there and then. For reasons incomprehensible to the 
surrounding masses. The rebels were quickly sorted out, and the 
battalion commander was immediately replaced. 
  The departure of the local workers of the power structures 
for Bergman's headquarters is easily explained by the 
"perpetrators of the celebration," themselves: revealing the 
crime of homicide is actually tantamount to revealing the crime 
of stealing chickens. Vadim Shevtsov smiles: "It is a pity I 
don't have the documents on some of the workers right now. You 
should take a look. The reason for the departure: at 
headquarters they pay, after all, in Russian rubles, almost 
twice as much as we do..." 
  The report of the Tiraspol GUVD, which we obtained from 
President Igor Smirnov, is astounding: a modest amount of crime 
and a 50-70 percent disclosure rate. In the words of Mikhail 
Bergman and the officers retiring from criminal investigation, 
the secret is simple. In the first place, the militia workers 
were given a verbal order to cease serious investigative 
activity. In the second place, there is a secret agreement with 
the criminal groups on carrying out their "actions" and moreover 
"stripping down" outside the limits of the Dniester capital. In 
the third place, which is, perhaps, the most terrible thing -- 
many of the corpses fished out of the Dniester, despite the 
degree of their decomposition, are written off to the war, and 
the contemporary homicides, that the whole city knows about, are 
for some reason not entered in the official reports of the GUVD. 
Two days before we arrived, a businessman was killed by a bullet 
in the head. An old man who was a witness is to this day in a 
resuscitation ward. A short time earlier, another businessman 
was killed in his motor vehicle and "at the same time," again, a 
small child ended up in a resuscitation ward. 
  Like a living legend, the story goes around Tiraspol of how 
two subdivisions of the power structure -- special service and 
GB [state security] -- shot at each other. According to the 
Tiraspol version, two policemen from Ukraine were tracking their 
"own" criminal, who had decided to visit the charming land of 
the Dniester. The special groups decided to take them all at the 
same time. The result -- three "guests" and a few of their own 
men were killed. 
  "You understand, we are just setting up our organs of law 
and 
order," Vadim Shevtsov told us. 
<H8>  Power Is a Simple Matter </H8>
  We were able to sense Vadim Shevtsov's power from personal 
experience. Three days before we arrived, Viktor Petrenko, 
director of the Tiraspol Motor Vehicle Service, was suddenly 
arrested. His last name figured in a story with a "Lincoln," 
which had been standing idle on enterprise territory for several 
months, and according to certain data, had been bought as a 
present for President Smirnov who, for understandable reasons, 
refused the latter. Petrenko, who was on friendly terms with 
Smirnov, like one of the family, as they say, had access to the 
government house, and in addition -- had MVD and GB certificates 
and several models of weapons. He was taken on the way from the 
local "White House" to the presidential car -- and what was 
curious, escorted by Smirnov himself. Vadim Shevtsov, who 
personally took part in this incident, described Petrenko's 
behavior as a "violation of the conditions of a special 
position," and of his own will placed him under administrative 
arrest for a while... for 30 days. Just like the good old days 
-- without a trial or investigation. Igor Smirnov kept modestly 
silent. 
  Appearing on television on the subject of Petrenko's strange 
arrest, on the third day of Petrenko's sojourn with vagrants in 
a jail cell, Mikhail Bergman then and there "received" a whole 
program from Dniester Radio. The radio reported that Bergman had 
"resorted to such dirty tricks" that he had even thought up a 
kind of arrest for Petrenko. In confirmation of its conclusion, 
it cited the words of the motor vehicle service director's wife, 
who had informed it that her husband, she said, had gone off to 
Odessa and would be there for dinner. At this point, Petrenko 
had not been there for dinner three times. 
  We received the answer to our question about Petrenko's 
strange fate next morning: by decision of the Dniester Public 
Prosecutor, he was released from the jail cell with the 
admission that Vadim Shevtsov, director of the State Security 
Committee, had violated his authority, since in Petrenko's 
actions "there were no elements comprising a crime." 
  Vadim Shevtsov himself explained the occurrence with the 
very 
simple sentence: "This is our private matter." 
  The "private matter" resulted in the fact that during this 
time, Victor Petrenko and his family, after thanking us for the 
unexpected help, left the borders of his native land, in the 
hope of finding a safe little town in a different region. 
  Aleksandr Lebed, laughing, evaluated what had happened: "It 
is obvious. Shevtsov is simply showing his strength, to keep 
Petrenko from saying anything unpleasant. Remember: Molotov's 
wife stayed home, and Kalinin's wife too, so that their husbands 
could walk on a short leash. Here, it is I, Shevtsov, who is the 
master." 
  In a private conversation with Petrenko, we received a 
similar response: 
  "Who is the boss in the city and the republic? Shevtsov?" 
  "Shevtsov." 
  "Can Smirnov count on his own guard in an emergency 
situation?" 
  "No." 
  The presidential guard, which confirmed our suppositions, is 
really subordinate to Vadim Shevtsov. Officially. He himself can 
see nothing so terrible in joining all the state security forces 
in the same hands. 
  Russia, it seems, has already gone through this. In August 
1991. 
<H8>  The "Special Feature" of Weapons -- Killing </H8>
  No one can name the whereabouts of the thousands of gun 
barrels that disappeared during the war. There are only local 
disputes about one-and-a-half thousand barrels, removed from the 
people "in the trenches," by military headquarters after the 
war. Local authorities accuse Bergman of specially destroying 
the registration log of the confiscated weapons, and "putting it 
to his own uses." Meanwhile, as Aleksandr Lebed confirmed for 
us, the situation was somewhat different: "The confiscated 
weapons were turned over to the local commanders. After that a 
special commission came to us for verification, and it even 
included Col Yakovlev (I am his enemy No 1, he even passed over 
Bergman). So they counted and recounted everything down to the 
last piece. The commission signed the written statement. Only 
then did I call out Col Bergman and say: put the statement at 
the bottom of the safe, but destroy the registration log as not 
assigned by the regulations. We created a special commission for 
this and destroyed it." 
  So just where are these thousands of firing pieces now? When 
will they surface? And whom will they kill and maim? 
  On the other hand, several hundred barrels with thousands of 
cartridges have already surfaced: according to the assertion of 
qualified Moscow authorities, they were already transported for 
the opposition to Moscow from the Dniester area during the 
October events of last year. As for the several dozens of 
participants from this sunny republic, in the words of Vadim 
Shevtsov, he bears no responsibility for them. Even though in 
"identikit" pictures, sent from Moscow to Tiraspol, people 
assigned to the same Dniester Special Service Battalion have now 
been recognized. Their last names, positions and nicknames are 
well-known. 
  In an interview for MK correspondents, Aleksandr Lebed 
informed us of one "attractive" fact. Military headquarters has 
documents according to which the Dniester Battalion sent the 
following weapons to Gagauzia (Budzhak Battalion): AKS-74 -- 300 
pieces, AKS-74u -- 50 pieces, 180 Makarov pistols, RPKS-74, 
Dergunov sniper rifles -- 7 pieces, AGS-17 automatic grenade 
launcher -- one, 100,000 ammunition units and 96 grenades. 
"Nothing reached Gagauzia, as its spokesmen confirmed." 
  Vadim Shevtsov had contrasting information on this score. 
Lebed sent the above-named weapons to Gagauzia. And they arrived 
there. 
  We did not see either side's documents. 
  Trustworthy confidential sources in Tiraspol made it known 
to 
us that in September of last year, three Russian opposition 
leaders were made a gift of three attractive Dergunov sniper 
rifles, which make a very accurate hole in the forehead of the 
desired victim at a distance of 1,200 meters. Their numbers: No 
65347, No 84282 and No 66480. Vadim Shevtsov answered this 
question: "I did not give any rifles to anyone." 
  The question was open for competent authorities in Moscow. 
  As for the Russian opposition, most of it shows open 
sympathy 
with the present Dniester authorities. Zyuganov, Makashov, 
Anpilov, Alksnis, Baburin, Umalatova, Pavlov and others visit 
Tiraspol on holidays and non-working days. Shevtsov thinks that, 
if the patriots are drawn to the Dniester area, why not mix with 
them? After all, other "leaders" express no particular desire to 
visit Suvorov's corner.... 
  For the "internal security" of the citizens of the Dniester 
region, particularly in 1992-1993, those wishing them were 
handed out weapons by the president's hand. This can be 
explained by the need for independent defense against criminal 
groups, since the organs of internal affairs have little power. 
Let us note that this situation developed against the background 
of the highly publicized shortage of weapons among the organs of 
law and order. 
  In all, according to the available registration book, 900 
barrels were issued to those wishing them. The Tiraspol Cotton 
Production Association asked for seven TT pistols and got them. 
Weapons are officially registered to the management of the 
metallurgical plant, the small Olimp enterprise, the editors of 
that same Dniester Radio, the directors of a metals structures 
plant, and others. And naturally, to all the officials of the 
republic -- "by virtue of the danger of their job." 
  In general -- it is all nothing. Some formulas resemble 
anecdotes. For example, Galina Andreyeva, a political leader, is 
permitted to carry a weapon only "if she has a weapon 
available." They permitted the deputy of one of the firms "to be 
issued one --." Pistol, rifle, and perhaps, machine gun? The 
head physician of the Tiraspol Maternity Home got the "go-ahead" 
for official registration of a personal pistol, but "supplying 
the weapon is his problem" -- as the resolution says. Some 
Dniester citizens are issued weapons from ... material evidence, 
from specific crimes. 
  There is a special approach for ten executives in the 
Dniester Government who hold the rank of ministers and deputies. 
They were issued... Simonov semi-automatic carbines, which in 
the stagnant times could be found only in the use of servicemen 
of the former Soviet Army. A. Karaman, vice-president of the 
Dniester area was distinguished more than anyone, in the sense 
of armament. He has the use of six types of weapons: two types 
of Kalashnikov automatic, TT, Makarov and Stechkin pistols 
(actually submachine guns), and a Simonov semi-automatic carbine. 
  Some of the people presented with weapons are now taking up 
permanent residence outside the boundaries of their beloved 
Motherland -- more precisely, in the far abroad. And just where 
the weapon itself is --remains only a guess, because the 
registration book has no notes on its being turned over. 
  All these things, however, in the words of Mikhail Bergman, 
are just the beginning. The worst is yet to come: "The Dniester 
Army is now preparing for the next putsch in Moscow," says the 
colonel. "Weapons are hidden throughout the villages, up to 800 
barrels each in the same place. They are preparing to ferry them 
to the Russian capital, where some of the barrels are already 
concentrated. Forty-six people using assumed names have now come 
to Tiraspol from Moscow. They are getting ready. A huge 
slaughter is slated for the autumn in Moscow...." 
  Vadim Shevtsov expresses no particular desire to refute 
Bergman and Lebed: "There are other people in the 14th." "There 
is no doubt that specific forces are standing behind Lebed, and 
it is generally known that he is a friend of Grachev and makes 
use of the army commander of the moment," the director of the 
republic's State Security explains to us. "After all, Lebed and 
I were friends. On 4 January 1993, however, Lebed suggested to 
me and to Matveyev, the former minister of Internal Affairs, 
that we take part in the overthrow of the PMR government. We 
refused. And then it started. (...) He, Lebed, by no means sees 
himself as Russian minister of Defense -- he sees himself as the 
second person who will bring order in Russia." 
  (In parentheses we note: to the frank question we put to 
Lebed concerning the fact that many people are waiting for him 
in Moscow, the lieutenant-general answered: "I do not want to go 
to Moscow.") 
  Igor Smirnov, president of the Dniester area, develops his 
colleague's idea: "The present situation is quite convenient for 
Bergman and people like him. If we, the PMR, can find a common 
language with Moldova, the Dniester area as a "hot spot" will 
disappear. (...) Russia needs all of Moldova because of 
geopolitical and strategic interests. We do not object, we are 
not leaving Moldova. (...) As Goebbels said, the more impudent 
the lie, the more plausible it is. They accuse us of the fact 
that the Dniester Battalion was at the White House...." 
  Both of them were of one accord: we don't want to collect 
documents on the 14th Army, we want it to be here, we don't need 
any aggravation. 
  So they just did not give us any documents against the 14th 
Army and the Tiraspol Military Headquarters. 
<H8>  What Can We Expect? </H8>
  The atmosphere in Tiraspol is unpleasant. Everyone knows 
about the tailing, telephone bugging and mutual "reconnaissance" 
of the opposing sides. It sometimes reaches the point of 
absurdity: people know the quarters from which the outside 
surveillance comes. The "adversaries" know each other by sight. 
The republic seems to be split in half. 
  Representatives of the Russian Army and the political 
opposition speak openly about replacing the "mafiosa" Dniester 
Government. With a more respectable one? Or -- with a more loyal 
one? Replacement -- in what form? 
  Russia's interests, as always, are veiled. It is possible, 
as 
quite often happens these days -- they are simply unpredictable. 
The Dniester area -- beyond any doubt -- is a "card" in the 
political game with Moldavia, which has so far not come into the 
CIS. The "card," however, may be played both in a peaceful way 
and in a military way. This can happen in the near future. 
  At the same time, the Dniester Government is not a sweet 
treat. Its relations with the Moscow opposition are obvious. The 
priority of force is unconcealed. The number of unregistered 
weapons is unpredictably high. 
  In both the Dniester area and Moscow there is peace for the 
time being. God grant that no one disturbs it. 
  P.S. Having returned to the capital of our Motherland, 
the MK correspondents noticed an outside tail following them. We 
do not know to which structure these people belong. On 21 May, 
the apartment of one of us was "frisked." The "guests" took no 
money or valuables. What they were looking for -- is still a 
mystery.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Zakharchenko, KAZTAG correspondent: "A Way </F>
Out of the Crisis Is To Firmly Proceed Toward the Market and To 
Have National Accord"] 
  [Text] Toward the end of last week, President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev paid a visit to East Kazakhstan and Semipalatinsk 
Oblasts. 
  At an aktiv meeting in Ust-Kamenogorsk, the president 
introduced Yuriy Lavrinenko, the new head of the oblast 
administration. 
  Subsequently the president arrived in Semipalatinsk where he 
also introduced to the aktiv the newly appointed head of the 
oblast administration, Galymzhan Zhakiyanov. 
  Speaking at these meetings, Nursultan Nazarbayev discussed 
the current economic situation in the republic. As is known, it 
is complex and, as the head of state stressed, in order to 
overcome the situation sooner we should tighten procedures for 
the allocation of credit to enterprises and proceed solely from 
the real financial potential in resolving all issues. 
  Incidentally, the ways to overcome the crisis were outlined 
to the fullest in the president's presentation at a session of 
the Supreme Council and his message to members of parliament. 
All residents of Kazakhstan should know the essence of these 
ways, as well as the position of the republic leadership with 
regard to solving domestic problems in order to avoid idle talk 
of which there is frequently no dearth precisely because the 
citizens are poorly informed. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev gave the following example. Disabled 
front-line veterans received preferences under 19 provisions. 
Their combined monetary equivalent came to 300 tenge. In view of 
this, the decision was made to replace numerous preferences that 
by then were hard to figure out with the raising of retirement 
benefits of this particular category of the population by 330 
tenge in order to provide it with targeted social protection. 
After all, not only veterans but also members of their families 
took advantage of the preferences. Was this fair? 
  Revisiting economic problems, the president noted that 
unprofitable enterprises are a heavy burden for the economy to 
shoulder. All of them will soon be declared bankrupt. It is more 
advantageous for the state to pay unemployment benefits upon the 
closure of such production facilities than to subsidize them. 
Getting rid of the continuously unprofitable enterprises will 
make it possible to stop the growth of inflation and invigorate 
foreign investment in the economy of the republic. 
  The head of state recalled that on 1 May the residents of 
Ust-Kamenogorsk held a rally at which demands to return to life 
as it used to be were aired. However, there is no return to such 
life, and this is an objective fact. We must proceed more 
rapidly toward market relations, stressed Nursultan Nazarbayev, 
and grant to the people the freedom to labor for their own 
benefit wherever and however they see fit. However, the state 
will not reduce its care for retirees, handicapped, and the 
employees of budget-financed institutions. Others should make a 
living themselves. Nobody will sustain parasitism and laziness. 
This is the main law of a market economy. We are now traveling 
along the path that the entire civilized world has covered, and 
we will only be able to achieve prosperity and welfare if we do 
not turn off this path. 
  The president paid special attention to ensuring stability 
in 
our society in the absence of which favorable changes are 
impossible. To maintain stability, it is necessary to ensure the 
equality of all citizens and a balanced cadre policy proceeding 
from the peculiarities of regions. It is important not to give 
in to provocations that are capable of causing internal strife 
and to strictly proceed from the law on pressing criminal 
charges against individuals fueling interethnic discord. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev also noted that there are those who 
indiscriminately pick on the activities of Kazakhstan's 
leadership. However, this is populism pure and simple. Let them 
propose alternative ways to overcome the existing situation. It 
is as easy as can be to exploit existing difficulties. 
  The president answered frankly numerous questions from 
participants in the oblast aktiv meetings, including the most 
sharply worded questions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Social Protection of the </F>
Population Zaura Kadyrova, by KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA 
correspondent Tamara Fomina; place and date not given: "We Can 
Sacrifice a Lot for the Sake of Economic Reform. But Not Our 
Elderly. The Minister Has Resigned. The Problems Will Not"] 
  [Text] As our newspaper reported yesterday, Minister of 
Social Protection of the Population Zaura Kadyrova has submitted 
her letter of resignation (as the reader can see, it has been 
accepted), explaining this action by the fact that decisions 
affecting pensioners are being made without her ministry's 
participation. 
  Someone snapped at Zaura Zhusupovna: Suffering from the 
Russian syndrome? Meaning the resignation of E. Pamfilova, the 
Russian minister of social protection of the population. How 
quick we are, however, to judge and gossip. What is it that 
compelled a person who had headed this difficult segment of work 
to make this decision? KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA asked Z. Kadyrova 
to tell us in more detail about the motives for her decision. 
  [Kadyrova] You know, this mental stereotype had been 
building 
for years--that the Minsobes [Ministry of Social Security] is a 
second-class agency. It had always taken a back seat, quietly 
and unquestioningly carried out directives, and listened to 
reprimands. 
  Today, however, we cannot live outside our turbulent time, 
which also forces us to be more active, to look for ways to 
survive, to bring issues into sharper focus, be more demanding. 
  Life is becoming increasingly difficult; prices keep rising. 
The 3 million pensioners, of course, need state support. I 
cannot say that the state does nothing, but in my opinion this 
is being done in a way that is not adequate for the current 
situation. Of course, the state must get on its feet, solve its 
problems. But I cannot imagine any state doing it at the expense 
of the least protected category of the population. 
  Many would prefer the old Minsobes. That is probably why the 
current one causes inconvenience. We submit proposals. Then 
behind our back, unilaterally, completely different decisions 
are made, which, in my view, worsens the situation. 
  Take, for instance, pension delivery. Seventy-five percent 
of 
pensions are delivered by mail. But in large cities, where there 
is a large concentration of pensioners, we have set up on an 
experimental basis our own delivery. Life has shown that this is 
precisely the form that can reach a pensioner quickly. This is 
all in the same system; one can make a request, track it on the 
spot. No, we are told, the Minsvyaz [Ministry of Communications] 
will be delivering pensions. 
  We ask why we should spend pensioners' money to support the 
postal service. We have to pay the postal service on average 2 
percent of the total amount of pension money. 
  The government changed its position on this issue several 
times behind our agency's back. The Antitrust Committee spoke 
against the decision to leave the delivery with the postal 
service. We must give a person the right to choose. The prime 
minister received me and the minister of communications, invited 
jurists. The jurists supported our position. I assured the 
collegium that the prime minister was on our side. But a 
different decision was made. The Constitutional Court had to 
interfere. 
  [Fomina] This is in the past, but tell me, did your ministry 
have anything to do with the certain presidential edict on 
stripping the disabled and war veterans of special preferences? 
  [Kadyrova] I was categorically against it when this question 
was being considered in the government. I said that by such 
actions we would put the president on the spot. And that is 
exactly what it turned out later. As the 50-year anniversary of 
Victory Day was approaching, all the CIS countries were looking 
for a way to somehow make the veterans' lives easier. How many 
of them are there left now? Today there are 150,000. When I was 
making report to the previous parliament, there were 206,000.... 
  Besides, the law and the social program on social protection 
of the disabled were for all practical purposes deactivated. 
  We bring our ideas and proposals for the consideration of 
the 
government. And then, when they come out in the final version, 
we do not recognize them. There is practically nothing left of 
them. 
  Or take the poverty line--40 tenge or 100 tenge. On what 
norms is this figure based? The poverty line can be determined 
only on the basis of the minimum food basket. And then you tell 
people honestly: "The consumer basket today costs this much, but 
the government is able to put up only 60 or 50 percent of it." 
Then people would know that the government thinks of them, that 
they count, that they are being asked to wait, to be patient, to 
make it through a difficult time. 
  Sometimes people say about me that a non-economist does not 
understand a lot of things. Yes, I am not an economist; I am a 
teacher, and I am the head of the Ministry of Social Protection. 
But then you, the economists, explain to me how a person can 
live on this 100 tenge a month. Do you think a pensioner does 
not understand it when he allocates his little pension per day: 
This much for bread, this much for increased municipal services, 
this much for medicines. 
  You tell me. If you convince me, I will be on your side. But 
there is no answer. 
  [Fomina] We in the newspaper get a lot of letters asking 
about the pension fund. What is this fund? Whom does it serve? 
  [Kadyrova] This is a difficult question. I absolutely do not 
agree with the situation where the pension fund is put on an 
equal status with all other funds. They just "stuck" it into the 
budget. What is the budget? What is the Minfin [Ministry of 
Finance]? They have thousands of problems! This one wants money, 
or that one. There are things that can wait a month, two, three. 
Pensions, on the other hand, have to be paid every day--from the 
first to the first of every month. While there is not enough 
money. In May and June, for instance, we needed 2.1 billion 
tenge, but only 398 million were made available. The situation 
is very difficult. 
  I ask the National Bank: Would you please tell me what is 
currently the amount in the pension bank accounts by oblast? And 
get an official letter--we do not have the right to disclose 
this information to you. To the Minfin--gladly! How do you think 
a minister feels when he cannot even get this information? How 
can he work? 
  I saw the pension fund in its different incarnations--when 
it 
was completely independent and autonomous. But now it has become 
essentially the second Ministry of Finance. When they started 
hiding from us what money is in the pension fund's accounts. 
When it gave R2.2 billion to commercial structures at a low 
interest rate. 
  I hope that the parliament will again remove the pension 
fund 
from the budget. It should not engage in commerce in a direct 
sense of this word. The banks should pay us interest on 
pensioners' money kept in the banks. Currently, not a single 
percentage point of interest is paid. 
  When the national currency was introduced, we proposed to 
index at least pensioners' deposits at a special conversion 
rate, so that their value would not drop sharply. But this was 
not done. 
  How many times did the Minfin end up with the egg on its 
face, "pushing" some decision behind our back. It slips all the 
time. And will many times again, I think. Together with the 
government's department of labor finances and social protection. 
It is called "department of social protection," but all it is 
concerned with is how to cut it, to save money on pensioners. 
  [Fomina] People sense this. You have to have really strong 
nerves to read numerous letters from our pensioners to the 
editors. They write not only that they have not had enough to 
eat for a long time--they are also not sure that they will be 
buried decently, properly. 
  [Kadyrova] I also read such letters. And draw conclusions. 
Last year I raised the question and apparently got the go-ahead 
to tell of our problems at the Council of the Republic. I wanted 
to have these problems considered comprehensively, with the 
participation of administration heads. Especially considering 
that we have done our own research and development work: the 
concept and the draft of a national program of social 
protection. They promised, but did not do it. 
  Then I went again to the leadership and asked once again to 
come back to this issue. Let us put our heads together and 
think--after all, to care for our veterans and pensioners is not 
just the job of our ministry. Those who are pensioners today had 
worked in all sectors of the national economy; they created 
everything that today is being privatized and distributed. This 
all has been created so far by the labor of the older 
generation. Therefore, I wrote a memorandum to the government: 
Give us even 10 percent of privatization revenue, so that we 
could direct it into enterprises employing the disabled--the 
blind and deaf-mute, to support them somewhat. The state budget 
does not have any money--then let us take it from here, from 
this additional source. Not a word. 
  I am tired. When the leadership talks about social 
protection 
while doing so little for it, one loses confidence that anything 
will change. 
  When I begin to talk, I hear remarks--the minister is a 
populist and oppositioner, they say. She goes against the 
government line. I do not understand why government members must 
unanimously nod their heads; why a member of the government is 
being deprived of the right to openly express his point of view 
in the Cabinet of Ministers, which is what I have always done. 
  I would rather not dramatize the situation. A minister's 
resignation in our time is a normal thing. I have no personal 
gripes. On the contrary, I am grateful to fate that it gave me, 
a person who grew up without parents, the opportunity to go 
through all stages of growth. My conscience is clear both with 
respect to our veterans and my colleagues. 
<H5>  FROM THE EDITORS </H5>
  One can feel differently about the motives of the "tired" 
Minister Zaura Kadyrova; about the decisions of councils in a 
number of northern oblasts who basically on their own--or just 
about against the law--reshuffle oblast budgets for the sake of 
their pensioners; to the fact of injudicious, to put it mildly, 
utilization of the pension fund; and other reports on the same 
subject. One thing is clear: We need somehow to pull our elderly 
out of the quagmire of despair and want. The guidance in this 
should be provided by the president's directives and thoughts 
presented in his recent message to the republic Supreme Council. 
  Let us remind them: "The priority goal of the social policy 
now and in the intermediate term is not to allow further decline 
of the standard of living of low-income population strata and 
persons living on fixed income..." In development of this 
premise, the message provides a detailed elaboration directly 
related to pensioners: "On the basis of a comprehensive analysis 
of the current social security system, the government should 
streamline pension benefits and implement a system of compulsory 
and voluntary pension insurance. We need to move towards 
creating a three-level system of pension security. At the first 
level--minimum pensions guaranteed by the state; at the 
second--pensions provided through compulsory pension insurance; 
and the third--pensions provided by nonstate pension funds." 
  What is amazing is the long patience of our 
all-understanding 
elderly. What they do need more of is honest information, 
timeliness in the administration of pension funds, and repentant 
authoritative explanations of the existing situation. There is 
nothing worse than to lose faith and hope. 
  The government's task is to search for an optimum way to 
resolve this problem in the environment of the crisis state of 
the economy, which results in cutting overall financing for the 
social sphere. 
  Which means, it is up to the government. But is it only the 
government? Of course not--it is also up to all societal strata, 
all of us. The elderly are our parents, relatives, neighbors, 
acquaintances....

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Verk: "....Even Local Governors Into the </F>
Cabinet?"] 
  [Text] ABV has been unable to obtain any official 
explanation of why the officially announced visit was postponed. 
In the press department of the president of Kazakhstan, they 
have said that the summit meeting will from all indications take 
place in early July. Some observers conjecture on this basis 
that the sides are attempting to use the intervening time to 
remove a number of problems related to the package of 
Russian-Kazakhstani "military" agreements, in particular 
Moscow's leasing of Baykonur and the Saryshagan exercise grounds 
in Zhezkazgan Oblast. Negotiations concerning the fate of the 
latter facility were recently conducted in the "capital" of the 
exercise grounds--the city of Priozersk--by Deputy Prime 
Minister Abilsiitov and Russian Air Defense Commander Prudnikov. 
It is also likely that President Nazarbayev's recent speech in 
our parliament and his promises to review the Law on Languages 
concerning the status of the Russian language, and most 
important--more vigorous "gestures" concerning the Eurasian idea 
in Kazakhstan and beyond--are compelling Moscow to make 
adjustments on the fly in its position on the question of dual 
citizenship. 
  At the same time, very interesting events have been 
occurring 
in the country's domestic political life. The first "salvo" of 
personnel rearrangements and reorganizations of government 
structures has been followed by a second. Creation of 
Minneftegazprom [Ministry of the Petroleum and Gas Industry] can 
rightly be considered the most powerful of those "shots." In the 
opinion of certain well-informed people, this step, suggested 
long ago by the logic of the oil intrigue's development, 
signifies an attempt by the central authorities to tighten 
control over this priority extractive industry. This was 
practically unattainable in the structure of the previous 
Minenergoprom [Ministry of Energy Industry], since the newly 
founded oil corporations, concerns and joint ventures [JV], 
which at the moment are working mainly for the future, were 
constantly "tripping over" the coal and power industry people 
with their needs of the moment, which does not make them any the 
less urgent. It would seem that Minneftegazprom, as conceived by 
the new structure's creators, will make it possible to 
"resuscitate" oil exploration. The difficulties experienced by 
geology today are well known after all. The very identity of the 
new minister--former director of the JV TengizChevroil--is also 
notable. Now that he is in that position, the American partners 
of the Atyrau petroleum workers will feel considerably more 
confident.... At the same time, some people also see the purely 
political aspects of the ministry's creation. It is worth 
recalling, for example, that in the past the present head of the 
Russian Government was in command of this very industry. As for 
Ravil Cherdabayev's service record, it offers every basis for 
such comparisons: deputy chairman of the Guryev Oblast Executive 
Committee, first deputy head of the oblast administration, 
deputy general director of the production association 
Tengizneftegaz. And to top it all off--candidate of economic 
sciences, which is very significant in the context of the 
shortage of economists on the Olympus of executive government. 
  As for the rest of the country's energy complex, we can take 
a page from the classics and repeat: Its future is both empty 
and dark. Judging from the present trend, bringing the power and 
coal industries under a common sectoral ministry will no longer 
save the decrepit colossus. Many informed people are inclined to 
see this as the explanation of why Albert Salamatin, former 
minister of industry, refused to head Minenergougleprom 
[Ministry of Power and Coal Industry]. Although, from what 
specialists say, this man accomplished quite a bit while 
"sitting" in the Minprom [Ministry of Industry]. And his 
departure, which at first seemed somewhat strange, to head the 
Zhezkazgan Oblast administration is by all appearances related 
to the government's desire to "restore order" in our copper 
"economy." 
  Incidentally, now that we are speaking about heads. The 
rumor 
that sprang up early last week that they would soon become 
members of the Cabinet of Ministers (see ABV, No. 51) seems not 
be unfounded. The "purge of the ranks" before "entry" into the 
government helps to explain the simultaneous replacement of 
three "governors." We should mention that a similar precedent 
occurred only at the end of last year, when four oblast hakims 
were simultaneously removed for various reasons. 
  The striking thing now is that the head of government has 
removed his deputies in regions with the poorest economic 
situation (and in the case of East Kazakhstan Oblast [VKO], this 
applies to the political situation as well). In that same VKO 
prices of goods and services have quadrupled in the last year 
and a half, and it takes seven minimum wages to buy the food 
necessary for elementary survival. Nearly fifty enterprises have 
been shut down (partially or completely). And all of this 
against the background of intensifying demands of the population 
for the region's autonomy, for activation of the Cossacks, and 
similar sociopolitical ferment. It is not surprising that 
inhabitants of Rudnyy Altay are more and more frequently 
inclined to blame all their troubles on the local 
administration, and probably indirectly on the higher-ups in the 
executive government. In that context, replacing Amangelda 
Bektemisov with Yuriy Lavrinenko is apparently supposed to cool 
off the passions somewhat, since the VKO belongs to the 
so-called "Russophone" regions. Another question: How long is 
the inability of the authorities (both local and central) to 
protect the social welfare of their subjects going to be covered 
up with ethnic compromises? 
  Last week's retirement of Zaura Kadyrova, minister of social 
security, proved that this is by no means a rhetorical question. 
No proof is needed for anyone with even a superficial 
familiarity with the mores and traditions of the Kazakhstan 
political elite: This act has no precedent in our homeland. And 
that also goes for the former minister's interview in the 
Saturday issue of the government newspaper. The reproaches which 
Mrs. Kadyrova addressed to the Cabinet of Ministers as a whole 
and to the finance ministry in particular are quite serious. The 
latter is essentially accused of having spent up the resources 
of the pension fund ("2.2 billion rubles were sold to commercial 
structures at low rates of exchange"). The former minister also 
made a very significant appeal to the deputies: "I hope that the 
parliament will restore the pension fund from the budget. It 
must not be involved in commerce in the true sense of that 
word." If these hopes are justified, then, in the opinion of 
many, there will be occasion to speak of the beginning of a 
government crisis in Kazakhstan. After all, most of the recently 
elected deputies (as well as their predecessors) are seriously 
(more or less, of course) concerned with "protecting the 
interests of the voters." And on 7 March the pensioners were 
hardly the most vigorous participants in the election. Thus, the 
"people's choices" have a 100 percent chance of "scoring points" 
with their constituents. Judging by certain steps taken in the 
past by our parliamentarians, they will try not to miss that 
opportunity.

<F P=106> ["Opinions" of Viktor Verk and Mikhail Ustyugov, editors of </F>
the policy departments of the newspapers KARAVAN and EKSPRESS K 
respectively: "Who `Released' Nurkadilov and Why?"] 
  [Text] [Verk] So what according to the logic of things 
should have happened long ago has happened: The permanent 
(seemingly) mayor of Almaty, Zamanbek Nurkadilov, has been 
removed from office. The "No. 2" in Kazakhstan had not had a 
chance to disappear into political oblivion (the position of 
ambassador in the capital of a Far East "dragon" is in this case 
tantamount to political death) before many people began to ask: 
What induced the No. 1 to take this step? 
  There are several possible answers, in my view. First 
possibility. Nurkadilov had as of late begun all too 
manifestly to compromise the president, being in terms of status 
his governor general in the country's principal city. It is 
sufficient to recall if only his actions during the fall-winter 
"offensive" against Soviet power. At that time the mayor (he is 
a member of parliament) himself placed calls to his deputy corps 
colleagues, offering them key positions in the 
ministerial-departmental vertical line in exchange for a 
statement that they were relinquishing their authority 
voluntarily. Many members of parliament received notice of the 
need to visit Office No. such and such in the city 
administration (and some of these many people hastily took up 
the "invitation"). And in the course of the election campaign to 
the new parliament the municipal "head" lobbied quite openly for 
"his" candidates for the people's elect (there was talk even of 
the existence of a kind of "mini-official slate" of 13 
"Nurkadilovite" candidates (nameplates with a majority of the 
names of this slate now adorn the doors of the parliamentary 
candidates). 
  It is perfectly natural that the talk about this, which 
percolated into the public (murder will out!), led to the 
appearance of numerous myths and stories from the life of the 
"No. 2." There was even talk about his undoubted influence on 
the No. 1 or the people closest to him and of some documents 
compromising these people in some way or other. Recalling the 
folk wisdom concerning fire and smoke, it may be surmised that 
some individual fragments of these apocrypha could be not far 
from the truth. On the whole, however, it was hard, observing 
the ex-mayor's public activity, to escape the feeling of some 
deliberate "self-publicity": Everyone says that this cannot be 
done, but I say it can. And I not only say but also do. We need 
recall if only Z.K.'s initially celebrated appearance on Almaty 
television of this spring or the business of the cancellation of 
benefits for retirees and the handicapped (subsequently restored 
by the president). Then a conference was promptly held in the 
capital's rayon administrations (in some, at least), which 
summarized proceedings roughly as follows: The president has 
restored the benefits--this is his business--we will operate in 
the old way. This "policy" of the mayor's could not, naturally, 
have failed to have caused perfectly understandable irritation 
in the "house upstairs." And the status quo was restored by the 
method traditional since CPSU times--"...in connection with his 
transfer to other work." This possibility would seem the most 
plausible, but there is another. So, second 
possibility. Nurkadilov's removal was connected with the 
concealed antagonism of some "interest groups" that has surfaced 
"in public" from time to time (the assassination of Igor 
Milgramm, the "chief builder" of Almaty, or the scandal 
surrounding the activity of the capital's meat-packing plant). 
There are as yet few direct arguments in support of this 
possibility (based on actual facts), but it should not, in my 
opinion, be discounted entirely. 
  Third possibility. Nurkadilov was removed to 
assuage the capital's patriots agitated by the resumed talk (at 
the prompting of the president himself) of the pending switch of 
the "crown" to Akmola. In this case the logic of the replacement 
of the mayor is exceptionally simple: Since this is being done, 
an attempt will be made, consequently, to "sweep" from Almaty 
with a "new" broom the old mafia, after which it would still be 
perfectly suitable for the role of first city of the country. 
Otherwise opponents of the transfer (which, according to the 
most modest estimates, would cost no less than $10 billion) 
could kick up a fuss via the press and "arouse" the 
assertiveness of the capital's average inhabitant. Which, with 
regard to the 1996 presidential elections (until which, 
incidentally, there remains not as much time as it might seem), 
is clearly not a part of the plans of Nursultan Nazarbayev.... 
  And, finally, the fourth possibility. The ex-mayor 
of Almaty paid with his position for insufficient concern for 
the inhabitants of Almaty, that is, the inadequate operation of 
transport, the growth of crime, the filthy streets, 
environmental problems, and so on and so forth. 
  This possibility would seem unlikely, though. For, according 
to the "sound" tradition that has evolved here, for a failure to 
discharge his direct official obligations an official is moved 
to a somewhat higher chair. In Mr. Nurkadilov's case this could 
be, at a minimum, the office of vice premier. But, in the 
opinion of people in the know, the formulation "in connection 
with his transfer to other work" does not leave the former "No. 
2" with any hopes of political "resuscitation." 
  [Ustyugov] The position of head of a megalopolis where all 
the leading structures--from state through mafia--are 
concentrated is always fraught with a certain scandal potential. 
The new appointment to the office of mayor testifies that not 
simply the "president's man" but a person from 
outside--experienced and at the same time neutral and totally 
uninvolved in the clamorous showdowns of the capital of recent 
times--has come to power in the capital. Shalbay Kulmakhanov was 
state counselor for housing construction for just seven months. 
Prior to this he was chief of the Aktyubinsk Oblast 
Administration, and before this, chairman of the North 
Kazakhstan Oblast Soviet Executive Committee. It is impossible 
in seven months, of course, to seriously change anything in such 
a crisis-ridden sphere today as housing construction. So the 
personnel shuffle undertaken by the president last November--the 
transfer of Kulmakhanov to Almaty--appears to have been, rather, 
an interim step undertaken with a view to the long term. 
  What determined this choice by the head of state? The 
calculation, probably, that the new mayor would not make many of 
the mistakes made by his predecessor. Zamanbek Kalabayevich had 
clearly detached himself from the government team, which, as the 
president intends, should be united. Sharply worded utterances 
about a cabinet failing to supply the city with petroleum 
products, pursuing a worthless tax, price, and budget policy, 
and bearing, from the viewpoint of the capital's authorities, 
"full responsibility to the people for the present situation" 
were being heard continually from the capital's city hall. It 
was obvious that Nurkadilov's "team" was playing its own game, 
the outcome of which was to many observers unclear. In this 
context Kulmakhanov's appointment looks first and foremost like 
the restoration of the "team principle." The new mayor will, 
most likely, act more cautiously, without noisy effects and 
public accusations against the government and the Supreme Court 
of Arbitration. Not a political "star" laying claim to a leading 
role in the state but an experienced manager, whose main task is 
to transfer the work of city hall from a scandal-populist to a 
constructive channel, is coming to the capital. Not the easiest 
of tasks inasmuch as the personnel changes will not spell more 
money for the city's coffers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nurlan Danenov, press spokesman for the </F>
president; place and date not given: "What Happened, Happened. 
And No More Than That"] 
  [Text] N.A. Nazarbayev's press spokesman comments on 
the president's recent edicts concerning personnel shuffles in 
the upper echelons of the executive. 
  [Question] Nurlan Zhumagaliyevich, the president's speech on 
television on Tuesday was general and nonspecific. He did not 
give a single direct reason for the "departure" of important 
officials, Z. Nurkadilov included, from their posts. 
  [Danenov] These changes are occurring in the context of N.A. 
Nazarbayev's speech at the session of parliament, in which he 
spoke of the need for certain personnel adjustments. 
  [Question] Please be more specific about Nurkadilov, if you 
can. The wording "in connection with his transfer to other work" 
without an indication of what work precisely usually means that 
a person is being removed with a big demotion. 
  [Danenov] I do not yet know to what kind of work he is being 
transferred, I do not have this information. 
  [Question] What happened, why was it decided to remove the 
mayor of the capital from office? 
  [Danenov] What happened, happened, and no more than that. 
Someone else has been appointed head of the capital's 
administration, and Nurkadilov has been released. 
  [Question] Is it true that he is in hospital following a 
heart attack? 
  [Danenov] I know nothing about this. According to my 
information, Z.K. Nurkadilov is currently on vacation. 
  [Question] Nonetheless, has he made a complete mess of 
things 
or "fallen somewhat short of his target" or will he be appointed 
with honor to just as high a position? 
  [Danenov] I repeat that the measures outlined by the 
president in his speech to the deputies and his appeal to them 
are being implemented. There is a rotation of personnel and, in 
places, their rejuvenation and the replacement of people who 
have been in their positions too long. When a person has worked 
for a very long time in one position, he no longer produces the 
results that he should.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The New Chief Is Also a Builder, But </F>
Can He Communicate With the Press?"] 
  [Text] According to information obtained from Petropavlovsk 
and Aktyubinsk journalists (where Z. Nurkadilov's successor, 
Shalbay Kulmakhanov, was chairman of the oblast soviet executive 
committee and chief of the oblast administration), our new mayor 
likes to meet the press. And not only employees of municipal 
television, what is more. And he is altogether more open and 
democratic than the severe Zamanbek Kalabayevich. 
  It is troubling, though, that the new chief, like the old 
one, is a builder by education and service record. This is a 
wonderful and the most peaceful profession on earth, but the 
coincidence is still disturbing. Especially since with a 
diplomatic evasiveness typical, most likely, of all 
builder-mayors, Sh. Kulmakhanov successfully turned down the 
offer an interview with this issue of KARAVAN-BLITS.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gaziz Aldamzharov, member of the Finance and </F>
Budget Committee, leader the Socialist Party of Kazakhstan 
faction, and cochairman of the Progress group, by Vasiliy 
Gryaznov; place and date not given: "Parliament's First Steps 
May Be Viewed Variously"] 
  [Text] He was born in 1947. A Kazakh. A graduate of a 
technical school, institute, and the CPSU Central Committee 
Academy of Social Sciences. He was a mechanical engineer of a 
kolkhoz, chief engineer of a fish industry association, first 
secretary of a rayon party committee, secretary and first 
secretary of the Atyrau Oblast Party Committee, chairman of the 
Atyrau Oblast Soviet of People's Deputies, deputy chairman of 
the Committee of the Supreme Soviet for Economic Reform, Budget, 
and Finances, and chairman of the Control Chamber. 
  In the present parliament he is a member of the Finance 
and Budget Committee, leads the Socialist Party of Kazakhstan 
faction, and is cochairman of the Progress group. 
  [Gryaznov] Gaziz Kamashevich, the first months of work of 
the 
new Supreme Council have passed. How may they be evaluated, in 
your view? 
  [Aldamzharov] We spoke a great deal last year about a 
professional legislative authority. And a new Supreme Council 
has been elected and has begun to operate on a permanent basis. 
What we were dreaming of has come to pass, it would seem: A 
professional parliament has been formed. 
  But whether it corresponds today to our requirements or not 
is another matter. And the first stage of its activity could be 
viewed variously, most likely. 
  The start of the work of the Supreme Council has not been to 
the liking of many of people, perhaps. To some extent it does 
not satisfy us either. This situation may be excused, of course, 
and it could be said that the new parliament is composed of new 
people that demanded first and foremost the solution of all 
organizational questions. And only after this, the basic 
conditions for work having been created, will the Supreme 
Council begin to consider the laws that society needs. 
  If we evaluate the situation from this viewpoint, everything 
becomes understandable and acceptable. 
  But it has to be seen from the other side also. 
  [Gryaznov] It is this, other, side that is predominant in 
society. The life of the majority of the population of the 
republic is deteriorating by the day, processes that could have 
unpredictable consequences are maturing.... 
  [Aldamzharov] Yes, whereas earlier we said that the economy 
was on the edge of the abyss, it may be shown today with figures 
in hand that it is now falling into this abyss at full tilt. And 
this is defined not only by the decline in production but also 
by the appreciable deterioration in the living conditions of the 
whole population of the republic. The minimum wage here recently 
was 40 tenge, today it constitutes 100 tenge. At that time the 
dollar cost 4.5 tenge, today it is 10 times dearer. 
  It should be mentioned immediately that such an increase in 
the minimum wage is wholly unsubstantiated and has been taken 
"as a rough guide." In no way does it today reflect the 
subsistence level and is almost 20 times lower than the rational 
consumer budget. The socioeconomic situation is further 
characterized by the fact that the solution of many questions 
has today simply been put in abeyance. 
  [Gryaznov] To what do you refer? 
  [Aldamzharov] Even the spring field work, say, has been 
performed in less organized fashion in the present year than in 
past years. The areas sown to practically all crops have 
diminished. 
  [Gryaznov] We have somehow stopped talking about the 
difficulties of the countryside, forgetting that foodstuffs and 
raw material that is most important for man's life are created 
here. 
  [Aldamzharov] Yes, we are attempting, as before, to resolve 
all problems at the expense of the countryside. And are hereby 
violating all the principles of economics. 
  Agriculture provides us with more than 50 percent of our 
national income. In destroying it we are depriving ourselves of 
these resources. But we are continuing this policy, wiping out 
society's motivation to labor. And if people are, in fact, still 
working, it is due to habit: Spring is here, the land is calling 
the master, he needs to go into the field. But such patience is 
not limitless. 
  In the first quarter of the present year the price of 
agricultural products increased 17-fold, and of machinery and 
equipment for the countryside, by a factor of 20.7. Mineral 
fertilizer has become 23 times more expensive, motor vehicles, 
25 times more expensive, and so forth. It is curious, but the 
cost of agricultural products today is almost twice as high as 
the selling price. In other words, whatever we produce on the 
land, everything is unprofitable, nothing justifies itself. And 
saying under these conditions that our agriculture has some 
prospects and that the reforms being undertaken in the country 
are benefiting it is simply immoral. 
  [Gryaznov] It is hard to imagine even to what the collapse 
of 
agricultural production would lead. 
  [Aldamzharov] Nonetheless, it continues. From 1 April of 
this 
year the price of energy was, as we all know, raised once again. 
Gasoline has become three times more expensive, diesel fuel, 
three and one-half times more expensive, and electric power, 10 
times more expensive. We have calculated that for the sum total 
of consumed energy alone the countryside has to give back 11 
million tonnes of grain. And the machinery, mineral fertilizer, 
building materials, and wages, finally? It will be good if the 
year proves productive. But what if there is a drought? 
  As of this time agriculture is the most aggrieved sphere in 
our society. We have always said that the countryside is in 
essence, by nature, and according to the evolved traditions 
conservative. This is so, and it is not always a bad thing. The 
countryside represents our common sources. For Kazakhs 
particularly. After all, our main traditions and language have 
been preserved thanks to the countryside, the village. 
  And now no one is saying a word in its defense. The 
intelligentsia should be doing so, it would seem. But it has one 
foot in the country, the other, in the town, and is incapable of 
expressing a steady opinion or of defending the interests of 
some one social stratum. 
  The rural population is today suffering most of all. It has 
the lowest wages, which, in addition, it does not receive for 
five or six months at a time, and inadequate treatment and diet. 
And the countryside is not going on strike, it still has 
hope--in God, the president, and those who govern it--and 
believes that concern is being displayed for it and that 
tomorrow life will be better. 
  But the state and the government have yet to find any 
solutions to the crisis situation. All eyes are turned as yet in 
one direction--toward foreign credit. But they are being used 
other than as intended and are not working for the future. We 
are simply eating our way through them and once again making 
shuttle trips to all countries and going with outstretched hand. 
  [Gryaznov] But let us return to agricultural production. 
Judging by the Socialist Party's program, you also see the 
development of private farming as a solution of the problem. 
  [Aldamzharov] Yes, the process of the disbandment of the 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes is being introduced persistently. We 
believe, however, that it should proceed in evolutionary 
fashion. The traditions of collective management in our 
people--both Russians and Kazakhs--go very deep. 
  In tsarist Russia the peasants lived as a commune, the 
Kazakh 
people, as one clan. And both peoples always saw the pooling of 
efforts and mutual support as the salvation from adversities. 
Today they are being told: Separate and thereby save yourselves 
from catastrophe. This is a distortion of the truth. And we 
believe that the kolkhozes and sovkhozes that are producing 
successfully and providing their people with normal living 
conditions should be left alone. 
  Our attitude toward the unprofitable farms is different. But 
if they are producing what society needs, we should, like it or 
not, subsidize them. 
  As far as private farming is concerned, there are more fine 
words uttered at podiums here than there are deeds. The state 
does not today have even a concept of farming. We have to think 
that peasant and mortgage banks could have been created and that 
the question of the possibility of the land leased by the farmer 
being mortgaged and of credit being obtained on the strength of 
this could have been solved in past years. People who know how 
to work well on the land could have had title to it transferred 
to them. Not in wholesale fashion, like much that we are doing 
here today, but with profound economic calculations. These 
problems will have to be tackled sooner or later, all the same. 
  Thus in making a general evaluation of today's state of 
agriculture it has to be affirmed that this sector has no 
future. But it could have. It is necessary for this that the 
state know what it wants from the countryside. It is necessary 
to clearly determine how much in the way of grain, milk, meat, 
and other products it needs. And give out a government contract 
on the strength of these quantities and pay the money in stages. 
Thirty percent of the total amount in spring, say, a further 30 
percent in the fall, and all the rest, at the time of the final 
settlement. The result would be a kind of interest-free loan on 
the strength of the future harvest. We, however, are forcing the 
farmer to take out such a loan in a commercial bank at 400 
percent annual interest. 
  Further, if the money for the government contract is not 
paid 
out in stages, at the end of the year the state must purchase 
the products from the peasant at the price that has by this time 
evolved on the market. 
  In addition, having received what was contracted by the 
government, it should have nothing else to do with the rest of 
the products: Their producer will himself determine where he 
should sell them and how. 
  Processing industry requires serious attention on the part 
of 
the state. The kolkhozes and sovkhozes themselves are not in a 
position to create it, earmarked credit is needed for it. And 
the state must have a precise program--what kind of plants and 
shops it requires, how many, and where--and attract foreign 
investors on the strength of it. 
  A similar situation is shaping up in many sectors of 
industry 
also. 
  [Gryaznov] What, in your view, should parliament's role be 
under these conditions? 
  [Aldamzharov] We need once again to proceed from today's 
realities. At a meeting of the cabinet last fall the president 
declared that we had made a mess of the anticrisis program. 
Shortly after this, a national currency was introduced. In any 
country a strict policy of economic support for the national 
currency is devised prior to such an action. We lack such a 
program. Finally, in April, the president, by edict, required 
the government to draw up a program for the present year. We do 
not have this either yet. 
  Suppose such a program appears. Adopted at such an unstable 
time, it will inevitably conflict with current laws. Revisions 
will have to be made to dozens of them since the program will 
not work without this, for people would comply with the laws, 
not the program. But the discussion and revision of legislative 
instruments takes quite a long time. 
  It has to be observed that the government has had time to 
prepare such documents. And had it been used rationally, 
parliament would as of this time have gotten a great deal done. 
In that case, I believe, the well-known statement of the Supreme 
Council would not have seen the light of day. But there is still 
no national program around which all of society could 
consolidate. 
  Further, we should clearly recognize that formulating a 
program that would satisfy absolutely everyone is impossible. 
This has never been the case anywhere in the world. 
Consequently, we need not only a program but also people 
devising it and prepared to answer for its realization. They 
would determine the appropriate tactics also. 
  These are indispensable conditions. They are not being 
observed here. 
  How do we devise a program? Four or five people are involved 
in this, usually. Then the document is discussed, amendments are 
made, and it is approved and begins life. But the people for its 
fulfillment are chosen not by the person who draws up the 
program, not the prime minister, but the president, since, 
according to the constitution, he is both head of state and head 
of the government. 
  We propose adjustments to this procedure. 
  The president is the head of state, who stands above all 
three branches of power. The head of the executive is the prime 
minister devising the program and selecting for it executants 
that think the same way he does. Here we would know clearly who 
was responsible for what. And, in addition, the dual control--of 
both the president and the prime minister--would strengthen 
executive discipline. 
  Similar changes should affect the administration chiefs 
also. 
Today some of them are trying first and foremost to please the 
president. And if they have done so, that's it, nothing else is 
of any interest to such a chief. People could write hundreds of 
complaints about him, the situation will not change. The 
president himself will not check every such instance, and 
persuasion is brought to bear on the person doing the checking. 
Lack of responsibility to the people engenders a general lack of 
responsibility. We propose, therefore, that all administrators 
should be elected by the people or the councils. This would 
strengthen discipline. And provision could be for the 
preservation of presidential influence on the situation locally 
for a structure of presidential representatives, as has been 
done in Russia, for example. 
  Thus the formulation of a national program of a way out of 
the crisis, the selection of its executants, and the 
establishment of a legislative base for and the corresponding 
adjustment to the political structure should, in our view, be 
effected simultaneously. The Supreme Council would occupy a 
fitting place in this process also. 
  [Gryaznov] Thank you for the interview.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Voronov, chairman of the Legal </F>
Development of Kazakhstan grassroots association and former 
chairman of the Committee for Deputy's Powers and Human Rights 
of the 12th Supreme Council, by Aygul Omarova; place and date 
not given: "I Always Try To Speak My Mind"] 
  [Text] Vitaliy Ivanovich showed himself to be in the 
previous parliament a most active, competent deputy that spoke 
in defense of human rights. The Law "On Rehabilitation of the 
Victims of Mass Political Repression" and decisions on the 
possibility of a change of nationality and on the prohibition 
against retirees being dismissed in connection with their having 
reached retirement age were drawn up and adopted with his direct 
participation. 
  [Omarova] Vitaliy Ivanovich, three months have elapsed. The 
election passions have subsided and cooled. How do you evaluate 
the election results today? 
  [Voronov] The election results came as a surprise neither to 
me nor to my fellow thinkers. Part two of the "Marlizonskiy 
ballet"--dissolution-elections--was performed precisely. 
  In organizing and conducting the elections and tallying 
their 
results the executive made practically no mistakes.... 
  [Omarova] I don't know about you but I personally have the 
impression that the elections were lost by the opposition three 
years ago, when the Supreme Council adopted the law on the 
administration chiefs.... 
  [Voronov] Three years ago there was no question either of an 
opposition or of administration chiefs. 
  It should not be forgotten that the institution of 
administration chief was introduced on 18 January 1992 for the 
"transitional period" up to 1995. But this system of state power 
was subsequently enshrined in Chapter XV of the 1993 
constitution. For this reason alone I voted against its 
adoption.... 
  There was no opposition then, nor is there such now.... 
There 
can be opposition to some policy or program. The leadership of 
Kazakhstan does not have an integral program. 
  Remember what became of the government's hefty Anticrisis 
Program? A statement of economic policy for 1994 on one-fourth 
of a page of newspaper! 
  [Omarova] Certain highly progressive deputies opted at that 
time for the administrative positions offered by the president. 
Everyone is free to choose for himself, naturally, but what had 
changed? The legislators lost their best, and the executive 
authorities did not, alas, acquire in their person new faces.... 
Yet we need to change the system.... 
  [Voronov] Truly, the system of state power needs to be 
changed. As long as there is a Gauleiter structure of 
administration of the state and a personnel policy according to 
the "shuffling of the old pack" principle is pursued and as long 
as the authorities have an opportunity to adopt unlawful 
decisions and perpetrate illegal actions (even 
anticonstitutional actions such as the notorious Operation 
Noose) with impunity, there will be no improvement in either the 
economy or in policy.... 
  Changing the system without the presence in society of 
interested and powerful political forces, an independent press, 
and the desire of the people themselves, on the other hand, is 
impossible. Although the chief of state still has, in my 
opinion, an opportunity to rely on healthy forces and rectify 
the situation. 
  [Omarova] The elections to the Supreme Council and the 
councils of various levels showed that the people are tired and 
that the struggle for deputy's seats was conducted, in the main, 
by three parties--the Union of Popular Unity of Kazakhstan, the 
Socialist Party, and the People's Congress of Kazakhstan--and 
also the trade unions, both official and independent. All the 
other parties and movements managed to elect only individual 
deputies. It is obvious that the lack of experience and the 
absence of real leaders took their toll, or was it entirely a 
question of the nomenklatura that, having consolidated, took 
revenge for previous defeats? 
  [Voronov] I would not say so. The people are tired not of 
elections, the people are tired of indigence, deception, and the 
mockery of the authorities. And had ceased to believe in these 
authorities. And it was a struggle not between parties and 
movements but between the "power party" (to which of the 
grassroots associations only the SNEK [Union of Popular Unity of 
Kazakhstan] pertained) and all the rest.... 
  The nomenklatura in Kazakhstan was never defeated. Just look 
who is running the state currently. Eighty percent of that same 
party nomenklatura that has become "market and anticommunist." 
Individual failures are of no consequence. 
  It is another matter that even the nomenklatura is 
heterogeneous and is itself torn by contradictions connected 
primarily with access to the shareout of the "public pie" called 
privatization. 
  [Omarova] Parliament has turned out to be quite variegated. 
Can it justify itself? How professional is the Supreme Council 
with this breakdown, when there are practically no lawyers or 
economists? 
  [Voronov] Parliament should not be justifying itself.... 
Parliament should be performing its main functions: legislative 
and supervisory. And performing them to a high standard. 
  Professionalism depends not on the presence of lawyers or 
economists in the Supreme Council but on the work of 
professional politicians in it. There are in Kazakhstan, I very 
much regret to say, very, very few professional politicians 
(regional and republican) of stature.... There are even fewer 
people prepared for law-making activity. 
  The new parliament began work in violation of the 
constitution, and not only its professionalism but also its 
probity, more precisely, legitimacy, was thereby immediately 
called in question. 
  I am talking about the fact that the Central Election 
Commission and then parliament also recognized the authority of 
all the elected deputies, despite the noncompliance by the 
majority of them with the requirements of Article 68 of the 
Constitution (all candidates undertook in their statement 
consenting to run to abide unconditionally by the demands of 
this article and to resign their positions). 
  In addition, according to the reports of certain deputies, 
they have been invited into oblast administrations, where they 
have been insistently advised against leaving their positions; 
do not move to the capital but take leave to discharge your 
deputy's obligations, which is anticonstitutional. 
  [Omarova] Whatever you may say about the masses, it is hard 
to exaggerate the role of the individual. And we have to speak 
about this. Whom among the deputies today might you cite as 
leaders, who influences parliament's adoption of laws that are 
vitally necessary for our society? 
  [Voronov] There are, in principle, many leaders, but 
mentioning them by name is not the best thing to do. 
  The elaboration and adoption of laws needed by the people of 
Kazakhstan can only be influenced by daily painstaking work in 
the groups of deputies, factions, commissions, and committees. 
What account the present formal leaders will give of themselves 
in them is hard to say.... Perhaps they will, on the contrary, 
perform a destructive role. 
  [Omarova] The president of the country has declared 
repeatedly that reforms are progressing here. Perhaps parliament 
also should have waited before adopting a decision on no 
confidence in the policy of the government (read: the president)? 
  [Voronov] The institution of the presidency is now four (!) 
years old here. The present president has been in the main roles 
in the state for approximately 10 years. In such a length of 
time many states, even postsocialist states, have achieved 
pretty good results in reforms. The day when it will be 
necessary to answer to the people is not far off, the 1966 
elections are coming right up.... 
  Soon our people, objectively more civilized than the 
Americans in 1776, in my opinion, will also come to an 
understanding of the proposition of the U.S. Declaration of 
Independence of universal significance: 
  "All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their 
Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure 
these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving 
their just powers from the consent of the governed. That 
whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these 
ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and 
to institute new government, laying its foundation on such 
principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them 
shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness...." 
  [Omarova] But market reforms objectively cannot fail to 
encounter serious difficulties? 
  [Voronov] But the pilfering of the state treasury and the 
natural resources, the arbitrary action and lack of 
responsibility of the bureaucracy, corruption, "plunderization," 
and so forth--are these the market? 
  Can reforms leading to the constant deterioration in the 
situation of the people be considered legal (that is, market)? 
It is being suggested to the people that they rely only on 
themselves, endure, tighten their belts, and such here. 
  If the country is sliding into the abyss, everyone should 
suffer, and government officials should not be paid high 
salaries. There should be no talk today about the prestige and 
responsibility of public service.... In a destitute country 
ministers should not be driving around in Mercedes but in small 
cars and only on official business. Not flying in Boeings but on 
regular scheduled passenger aircraft.... Neither Somalia nor 
Vietnam permit themselves such things. 
  Why did the parliament of the powerful FRG discuss not so 
long since the question of whether Chancellor H. Kohl's 
automobile was not too expensive? 
  Even in the Chile of the times of Pinochet (under a fascist 
regime) and now, when the country is developing rapidly, 
officialdom has not permitted itself to "grab" Mercedes at 
public expense because market reforms truly have been undertaken 
there. Even now, according to eyewitnesses, there are fewer 
imported cars there than in Kazakhstan (in Almaty even, perhaps). 
  It seems to me that the Supreme Council would be a big 
market 
supporter were it to bring under control and place within a 
legal framework the super-market reforms of the executive. And 
this is its sole chance of survival.... 
  [Omarova] The first steps in this direction have already 
been 
taken, we recall the statement of the Supreme Council on 
legislative policy. And this despite the fact that many people 
were speaking about a "pocket," pro-president parliament. 
  [Voronov] Our long-standing forecasts that parliament would 
not be a "pocket-presidential" parliament are being justified. 
It is formed mainly by administration chiefs, who have long 
objectively constituted a particular team. And this is why. 
  One process is, in principle, under way single-mindedly and 
successfully in the state: the so-called privatization 
undertaken by the State Property Committee. The administration 
chiefs, however, have been distanced from it, and the numerous 
conflicts between them and the territorial authorities of the 
State Property Committee bear this out. And the chiefs (or their 
people in parliament) have yet to have their "market" say.... 
  [Omarova] And would you be having your say about this had 
you 
been reelected a deputy? 
  [Voronov] I always try to speak my mind and say what I and 
my 
fellow thinker-colleagues consider right. I spoke about this to 
the president twice as his assistant, and I have not since been 
admitted to him.... 
  I am sure that my deputy friends will say all that needs to 
be said from the parliamentary podium. Better than I could, 
perhaps. 
  [Omarova] What should we expect from parliament? What is 
your 
forecast? 
  [Voronov] Forecasts are a thankless task. In my opinion, 
before the 1966 elections there will be either another executive 
or yet another "self-dissolution".... Although a dissolution, 
most likely. 
  Parliament now is like a clean sheet of paper. It will not 
assume our (12th Supreme Council) "sins." Nor will it assume the 
sins of the executive. 
  With the constantly deteriorating position of the people it 
will simply be forced to "play to the electorate," lest it be 
swept away by a wave of popular anger, and, consequently, to 
make claims against the executive (and the judiciary, for that 
matter), which is not accustomed to rendering account. And we 
are seeing this in an analysis of the first months of work of 
the supreme legislative body.

<F P=106> [Article by N.D.: "Republic National Bank To Be Outside the </F>
Framework of All Branches of Power"] 
  [Text] On 15 June, the Supreme Council confirmed Daulet 
Sembayev as chairman of the National Bank. The National Bank is 
assigned a special role in the banking and financial reform 
program proclaimed by the president. Plans call for the National 
Bank to be outside the framework of all branches of power. It is 
seen theoretically as an analogue of the American reserve 
financial system, a distinctive counterweight subject to the 
lobbyist influence of ministries and committees of the Supreme 
Council. On the eve of his confirmation to the position of 
chairman, Daulet Sembayev was removed from the Cabinet of 
Ministers, and thereby from the system of vertical subordination 
to the prime minister. In the words of President Nazarbayev, the 
National Bank will be responsible to us only for the state of 
the tenge. Characterizing Daulet Sembayev during his speech to 
the parliament, the president stated: "This is an honest man, 
without question. I am absolutely convinced of his decency. Also 
of no small importance is the fact that he is surrounded by 
young, talented economists." At the same time, the president 
noted that Sembayev "participated in drawing up and implementing 
all the previous programs. This too must be noted." It is 
expected that the National Bank, having received confirmation of 
its authority, will undertake energetic efforts to reduce 
monetary emission and, in the final analysis, to stabilize the 
tenge, if this is supported by the political will of the 
president and parliament. The appointment of Sembayev is the 
first personnel matter decided jointly by the president and new 
Supreme Council. The next candidacy to be presented for 
examination by the session will be that of Mikhail Malakhov, 
recently recommended by the president for the position of 
chairman of the Supreme Court.

<F P=106> [Article by Karlygash Yezhenova: "Grain Producers Who Have </F>
Completed Mandatory Deliveries May Dispose of the Remainder as 
They See Fit"] 
  [Text] Republic Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko has 
signed the Decree on the Sale at Commodities Exchanges of the 
Kazakhstan Republic of Permits Affording the Right of Grain 
Export Shipments in 1994. 
  According to the document, the republic's Ministry for 
Foreign Economic Relations is given the right to conduct 
auctions at the International Kazakhstan Agro-Industrial 
Exchange for the sale of permits to participate in the 
implementation of intergovernmental agreements for grain export 
shipments during the current year: 3,000 tonnes to Uzbekistan, 
500 tonnes each to Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Iran, 360 tonnes to 
Tajikistan, 150 tonnes to Moldova, and 50 tonnes to Turkmenistan. 
  Permitted to participate in the auctions are economic 
entities that have presented contracts for grain shipments from 
the 1993 crop net surplus as of 1 September 1994, and as of 1 
November 1994, from the current year's crop under the condition 
of priority fulfillment of contracts for grain sales to meet 
state needs. All contracts must undergo preliminary expert 
review by the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. Grains 
exported in accordance with intergovernmental agreements are not 
subject to customs duty. Grain exports through barter 
arrangement are permissible. 
  Anatoliy Savelov, deputy chief of the Department for 
Economic 
Policy of the republic Cabinet of Ministers, provided the 
following comments on the decree: 
  "In 1994, in contrast to previous years, a new, unified 
procedure was established for selling grain to entities outside 
Kazakhstan. Grain sales of the 1993 and 1994 crops will be 
effected in three directions: mandatory grain sales to meet 
state needs, grain shipments in accordance with 
intergovernmental agreements, and sales of other net surpluses 
of grain. 
  "Mandatory grain deliveries to meet state needs are effected 
in accordance with the Decree of the Kazakhstan Republic Cabinet 
of Ministers on Purchases and Shipments of Agricultural Output 
for State Needs in 1994. According to the decree, the total 
volume of mandatory grain deliveries to the state is 7 million 
tonnes. This volume is divided among the 17 republic oblasts. In 
this regard, it is stipulated that the directors of ministries, 
associations, joint-stock companies, and other republic 
organizations entrusted with functions as state clients, as well 
as the heads of oblast and rayon administrations, are 
responsible for the placement and fulfillment of orders for 
grain purchases and deliveries for state needs in the full 
amount and of suitable quality. 
  "Grain producers who have completed their mandatory 
deliveries may dispose of the remaining grain as they see fit, 
including exporting it. 
  "Rural producers have two ways of doing this. 
  "The first is to sell the grain through Kazakhstan's 
fulfillment of intergovernmental agreements. Here the Ministry 
for Foreign Economic Relations conducts auctions at the 
Kazakhstan Agro-Industrial Exchange in the sale of permits for 
the right to effect export shipments of grain in accordance with 
intergovernmental agreements. Obtaining a license in this manner 
affords the following benefits: exemption from customs duty of 
the entire volume of grain to be shipped, and first-priority 
issue of serviceable, covered freight cars for grain shipment. 
  "The second method consists of nonauction sale for export to 
any country of grain net surpluses for either the currency of 
this country or through barter arrangement, at the grain 
producer's discretion. 
  "In this event, the grain producer, or other economic 
intermediary selected by the producer to sell its grain 
surpluses, purchases export permits that are sold by oblast 
organs of the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations at 
regional commodities exchanges. 
  "An economic entity is obliged to present a contract for the 
grain shipment, including a shipment through barter arrangement, 
to the oblast organ of the Ministry for Foreign Economic 
Relations for its expert review. It must than obtain a license 
and register the contract in question at the regional 
commodities exchange. 
  "In all cases except mandatory deliveries for state needs, 
grain sales must be effected prior to 1 September 1994 for sales 
from the remainder of last year's crop, and after 1 November for 
sales from the 1994 crop. 
  "The mandatory expert review of contracts is established 
with 
the aim of preventing grain shipments at dumping prices."

<F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Vasiliy Gryazov under the </F>
rubric "Session of the Supreme Soviet": "What Kind of Bank Do We 
Need?"] 
  [Text] Financial experts are receiving complaints 
from all sides today. 
  The people are looking for the causes of the 
deterioration of our life and are inclined to see them in the 
sphere of monetary circulation and the work of the banks. They 
think the latter have caused their investments to lose value, 
they are "heating up" inflation, ruining the economy, etc. Money 
has become the measure of everything on earth, and nobody ever 
has enough of it. The banks are the main ones involved with 
money.... 
  "In fact," says the republic's chief banker, Daulet 
Sembayev, 
"such an approach to the realities of the day is too simplistic." 
  He was speaking before parliament at the plenary session on 
the morning of 16 June. And before that he "passed" through two 
committees of the Supreme Soviet--on finance and the budget and 
on the economic reform. The latter discussion with the deputies 
lasted four hours. 
  The amount of attention paid to Daulet Sembayev is linked to 
the fact that the parliament had to approve the president's 
edict of 17 December of last year on his appointment to be 
chairman of the republic's National Bank. 
  As we know, the previous members of the Supreme Soviet had 
approved Galym Baynazarov for this position for a period of six 
years. 
  But after the parliament's authority was suspended he 
submitted to the republic president a request to resign because 
of health reasons. The president granted his request, placing 
Daulet Sembayev in the position of head of the National Bank. 
  Every one of us is constantly dealing indirectly with banks. 
  But many are unaware of the specific nature of their 
activity. And everything that has occurred in our former USSR 
has had a negative effect on their operation. First of all there 
was the collapse of economic ties and the destruction of the 
ruble zone. Additionally, our banking system, in the opinion of 
specialists, has remained immobile for decades and is the most 
outdated in the world. 
  And now it must rise to the level of world standards almost 
all at once. Is this possible? 
  Probably a lot could have been done during the past two or 
three years. It is up to specialists to analyze the reasons why 
this did not happen. But even today the National Bank has not 
yet entered the market age. It continues to perform many 
functions that are not properly within its realm. Forces are 
being dispersed and the normative base is in need of further 
improvement although, it seems, there are special laws on banks. 
Its possibilities of effectively influencing the monetary-credit 
policy are still limited. 
  And nonetheless, in Daulet Sembayev's words, the National 
Bank is taking certain steps in the necessary direction. 
  Today it is no longer working directly with economic agents 
and is not granting them direct credit but is concentrating its 
efforts on administering the state banking system. Credit 
auctions have become a regular event and payment relations are 
being arranged with the banks of the countries of the 
Commonwealth. 
  More than 20 normative acts have been developed and will be 
enacted, work is proceeding on new laws, and measures are being 
taken to lower the inflation level to 12-15 percent by September 
and to 5-10 percent by the end of the year. We already managed 
to reach these goals in January-March of this year. 
  The deputies were interested in the reports not only on the 
main directions of the banks' activity but also on more specific 
measures it has begun to implement. 
  In particular, effective 1 July up to 40 percent of the 
credit resources will be distributed through auctions in the 
oblasts. The introduction of auctions--an element of the market 
in monetary circulation--is linked to the fact that only through 
them is it possible to establish the true value of money. The 
use of credit for its intended purpose is being monitored more 
closely. Effective 1 July a system of "mortgage credit" will be 
introduced whereby it will be possible to borrow money using 
securities, mainly government, as collateral. Three auctions 
have already been held for selling these securities. 
  According to the logic of the transformations the republic 
National Bank should become a normal state bank that meets world 
standards, and all commercial banks should be executive bodies 
that preserve their authority as intermediaries that attract 
investments from the population and legal entities. The first 
version of this reformation has already been developed and sent 
to all interested parties for study. It earmarks the 
transformations of the branch banks, especially the 
Agroprombank, increases demandingness with respect to commercial 
banks, etc. 
  As early as last year a supervisory department was created 
in 
the National Bank that was intended to protect the interests of 
the depositors. During the year it investigated the activity of 
160 banks and 261 branches. 
  For violations revealed during the course of these 
inspections 15 licenses were revoked and 200 million tenge in 
fines were imposed. 
  The following detail is also of some interest: The structure 
of the apparatus in the National Bank has been reduced recently, 
and 143 jobs have been cut. A new form of wages will be 
introduced for employees whereby focus will be placed on bonuses 
for workers for their personal contribution to the institution's 
successful activity. Plans are being developed for training and 
retraining of personnel and the introduction of electronic 
equipment with future access to the consolidated computer 
network. 
  In a word the National Bank is gradually making the changes 
demanded by life. 
  But Daulet Sembayev's report did not satisfy all the 
deputies 
even though it was filled with information. The speaker was 
asked many questions and then the members of parliament 
exchanged opinions. The chairmen of the Supreme Council 
committees on finance and budget, Orazgeldy Baymuratov, and on 
economic reform, Orazaly Sabdenov, reported on the conclusions 
drawn at the committee meeting. Both sets of conclusions 
contained harsh critical remarks against the National Bank, but 
the former recommended that Daulet Sembayev be confirmed for the 
position and the latter abstaining. 
  The same range of opinions existed among the deputies. 
Mukhtar Tyunikeyev, for example, was inclined to think that a 
certain amount of the blame for today's situation in the economy 
and finances lies with Daulet Sembayev personally, and Kazhmurat 
Nagmanov is convinced that it is wrong to blame the National 
Bank for all the problems because it cannot conduct an 
independent economic policy but carries out the will of the 
government and parliament. This range of opinions became more 
apparent during the voting. There were 95 members of parliament 
who voted in favor of approving the president's edict.

<F P=106> [Article by Taumush Dzhumagaliyev, State Prize Laureate of </F>
the Republic of Kazakhstan, candidate of 
geological-mineralogical sciences, "honored" oil worker: "Oil 
and Gas Industry of the Republic Is Dormant, Although It Has 
Absolute Grounds for Independent Existence"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Oil </H5>
  The principal scope of geological prospecting for oil and 
gas 
in the Caspian depression was oriented until recently on the 
search and prospecting for fields in subsalt deposits. This 
direction justified itself with the discovery in the 10th 
Five-Year Plan of very large gas and oil fields, which made it 
possible to create a powerful base for the country's oil and gas 
production. But the oil and gas condensates that emerged, unique 
in their reserves, and the fields contain a substantial 
concentration of aggressive components, which impeded their 
processing, because of the unresolved aspects of many 
technological and technical problems. It is enough to recall 
that the USSR lagged behind the West for almost 20 years in the 
level of development of production technologies. 
  All of this made it compelling to sign an agreement with the 
Chevron Corporation. Difficult negotiations were conducted in 
the course of several years, and a contract was signed as a 
result within the framework of the USSR. According to the new 
contract (1992), the period of validity was set at 40 years. 
This transaction will be appropriate, although the contract has 
not been subject to expert ecological examination as yet. 
  Analysis of the results of geological prospecting work in 
the 
12th Five-Year Plan showed that their effectiveness in the 
Caspian gas and oil bearing province is one of the highest in 
the former Union. The five-year task for increasing the reserves 
of oil and condensate in the republic as a whole and in West 
Kazakhstan was fully implemented owing to the exploration of 
previously discovered productive sites (Karashagana, Zhanazhol, 
Tengiz, and Korolevskoye). 
  Active prospecting in the subsalt deposits that was 
undertaken in the last 15 years was not crowned with success, at 
least at depths up to 5-5.5 kilometers in a number of areas that 
were studied in detail from a geophysical standpoint and drilled 
intensively, and with which a high promise of gas and oil 
presence was associated. And this will create a tense situation 
in increasing the raw materials base of the republic, although 
today, as never before, there is a need for highly profitable 
oil and gas fields that are accessible for quick and highly 
efficient development. 
  The main reason for the difficult situation that has 
developed, in my opinion, is the elimination in 1982 of the 
Kazneftegazrazvedka administration, which was formed over the 
decades and which explored very large oil and gas condensate 
fields. Also having a negative influence is the disunity of the 
geophysical service in West Kazakhstan and its inadequate 
resolution capability in the preparation of deep drilling 
structures. 
  The necessity for combining the geophysical organizations of 
the former Nefteprom and the Ministry of Geology, which will 
make it possible to reduce administrative expenditures, urgently 
suggests itself. Moreover, the demarcation of territories of 
West Kazakhstan between departmental organizations will be 
removed, which will make it possible to concentrate prospecting 
geophysical research in the most promising directions. 
  In the meantime, the scientific organizations of the branch 
are not very concerned about the development of methods of 
qualitative evaluations of fields in the early stages of 
prospecting work. This leads to delays in the dates for 
prospecting and exploration and also to an unjustified increase 
in their costs. The oil and gas prospecting areas of Tortay, 
Elemes, and others, where several dozen subsalt deep wells were 
drilled almost without results serve as an example here. 
  As for the academic scientific organizations, in my opinion, 
they are still engaged in unspecific research, such as: "The 
study of the sedimentary basin evolution to evaluate their oil 
and gas bearing potential and determine the priority directions 
in the development of the Republic of Kazakhstan fuel-energy 
complex," or the "compilation of a prediction map of gas and oil 
in the Caspian Depression." 
  The main task of the geological prospectors always remained 
to shift predicted reserves to a proven reserve category; that 
is, industrial. All efforts should be directed at exactly this. 
  There are no new discoveries, and the old ones have already 
been sold at a loss, including Kenbay (Moldabek-Kotyrtas), the 
largest super saline oil field, now named the Munay SP [joint 
enterprise]. Its reserves were successfully protected by 
KazNIGRI in 1990, and the field has been readied for 
exploitation. Unfortunately, it remains to this day a subject of 
discussion between Kh. Biderman, an American businessman, and 
the administration of Kazakhstan's Atyrau Oblast. 
  The conservation of reserves, instead of their accelerated 
involvement in processing, is at the least an impermissible 
luxury, bordering on crime, for the economy of the state. It is 
paradoxical that no one bears any kind of responsibility for 
such mistakes. It would be proper, in accordance with the 5 
April 1994 Kazakhstan presidential edict "On Additional Measures 
for Regulating the Use of Mineral Resources for Geological Study 
and the Mining of Minerals," to accelerate the conduct of strict 
order in the use of mineral resources." 
  The situation is no better with the development of marginal 
[zabalansovy] or suspended oil fields. For example, Zholdybay 
and Akhmeshet were transferred with the approval of the oblast 
administration to the Atyrau trading house. The latter, having a 
vague idea about the oil business, is creating the Sanako firm, 
which plans to invite Western partners as contractors, in order 
to take their equipment and technology. Moreover, they want to 
settle with them with money, and they are again taking credit 
from the state. 
  It turns out to be more profitable in such cases to rely on 
foreign investments than on credits and loans, inasmuch as they 
ensure direct access to modern technologies, etc. The main thing 
is that a heavy burden is not assumed by an already depleted 
budget and, to the contrary, this promotes its increase. It is 
not without reason that world practice recommends that investors 
should be involved primarily for the development of already 
explored fields. 
  Kazakhstan is blindly imitating Russia in many aspects, 
forgetting that since 1992 it has been the law there that the 
one who finds and produces oil is the one who trades in it. But 
in our republic, as before, it does not serve the workers. As a 
result of which the oblast that is the richest in an industrial 
sense was transformed into an impoverished and backward kray. As 
is known, 94.3 percent of the explored reserves of oil and gas 
and more than 90 percent of the potential resources of 
hydrocarbons are located in West Kazakhstan, and its 
significance as the main region of the republic for producing 
oil and gas will not change even in the long run, which should 
be made the basis of the strategy for the development of the 
fuel-energy complex. All of these arguments are intensified many 
times over, if the unsold predicted resources on the land and 
especially in the water area of the Caspian Sea are taken into 
account. Kazakhstan unquestionably will become a second Kuwait 
to the extent that the Caspian shelf is developed while 
observing clean geological protection. 
  It should be added to what has been said that 149 of the 160 
oil and gas fields, and five of the six oil and gas producing 
associations, are situated in this kray, and the Yuzhkazneft PO 
[Production Association] acquires its development through the 
organization of the Caspian oil and gas-bearing complex. This 
connection must be maintained permanently. 
  The total of the aforementioned facts dictates the need for 
moving the headquarters of the Kazakhstanmunaygaz to West 
Kazakhstan. With time it will be necessary to examine the 
question concerning the location of the Kazakhstankaspiy shelf. 
It must be assumed that the industrial development of the 
continental shelf will start in the northeast of the Caspian, 
and not on the "Trans-Il Alatau shelves." 
  The degree of exploration of resources in Kazakhstan is 
relatively low. This means that a significant and stable 
increase in oil production in the republic depends not only on 
the development of known fields, but also on the results of 
prospecting-exploratory work. Their level in recent years is 
sharply lowered, while, given the existing geological potential, 
it should grow steadily. 
  There is an extremely difficult situation in the geological 
industry today. At the present time, geological exploratory work 
has been stopped in many organizations. For example, in the 
former Atyrauneftegazgeologiya PGO [expansion not identified], 
now the Akbota holding company, 65 percent of the oil and gas 
exploration enterprises this year are functioning thanks to the 
Kazakhstanturkmunay, and out of the remaining staff, a majority 
has been cut, and the rest are on indefinite leave. In the 
advanced North-Emba oil and gas exploration expedition, out of 
10 drilling brigades, three remain today that maintain 
themselves on state budgetary infusions of the Ministry of 
Geology. Field geologists do not receive their wages for months. 
  Recently, after conversion to joint-stock companies, the 
Embaneft PO became the Embamunaygaz Joint-Stock Company and the 
Tengizneftegaz PO in Kulsary became the Tengizmunaygaz 
Joint-Stock Company. The sum of their annual oil production 
totals not more than 2.3 million tonnes, of which 823,000 tonnes 
is the share of the latter. I think it would be advisable to 
combine them into one under the aegis of the Embamunaygaz 
Joint-Stock Company. The common process in oil and gas 
production is artificially divided into indicators that are not 
related to each other, which consist of: an increase in 
reserves, preparation in linear kilometers, meters gone through 
or drilled wells, tonnes of produced raw materials, kilometers 
of laid pipelines, etc.

<F P=106> [Article by Lyubov Dobrota: "Is the Power Industry on the </F>
Brink of Regional `Sovereignization?' Vital Activities in the 
Entire Southern Section of the Republic Have Been Endangered by 
a Single Stroke of a Pen"] 
  [Text] For the last 30 years, all three southern 
oblasts of our republic were supplied with electricity through 
the Yuzhkazenergo system. Following the disintegration of the 
USSR, the bulk of the power capacity in this region ended up 
abroad, in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. The Zhambyl 
GRES [State Regional Electric Power Station] is the only station 
that is in a position to meet 80-90 percent of local needs. 
However, in view of a fuel shortage, the Yuzhkazenergo 
distributes the miserly amount of power which the station 
currently generates evenly among South Kazakhstan, Zhambyl, and 
Kzyl-Orda Oblasts. 
  This robs of its sleep the leadership of Zhambyl Oblast, 
which considers itself the owner of electricity generated at the 
Zhambyl GRES. The two adjacent oblasts are not taken into 
account. The desire to dissociate at any price borders on the 
absurd. For example, it is proposed to tear down the power lines 
built by the Yuzhkazenergo Production Association and to create 
Zhambylenergo, which will report solely to the local 
authorities. The government has given the go-ahead for the 
partition of the power industry in South Kazakhstan, apparently 
being reluctant to pick a quarrel with the administrator of 
Zhambyl. 
  Gennadiy Knyshev, deputy chief engineer of Yuzhkazenergo, 
believes that "10 years ago, when the economy operated in a far 
steadier manner, such a reorganization could have been feasible. 
At present, this is a step toward the abyss." 
  The consequences of the undertaken transformations are easy 
to figure out. For example, where are skilled cadres to be had? 
Hardly anyone will go to Zhambyl from the abolished 
Yuzhkazenergo or Russia. On the contrary, specialists that are 
left without a job will head for the historical motherland. 
Inexperienced people will be recruited by the Zhambyl 
administration, and, therefore, the likelihood of an emergency 
situation will increase. This is as clear as can be to the power 
industry personnel of all three oblasts. Being concerned about 
this turn of events, they appealed to Kazakhstanenergo, the 
former Ministry of Power and Fuel Resources, and the republic 
government with a letter which, in particular, says: 
"Electricity consumption in the region remains the lowest in the 
republic. At a stressful time of preparations for the coming 
winter, with a minimal reserve of fuel, spare parts, and 
materials available to us, we learned with alarm about the 
expected division of our energy system and the creation of a 
separate staff for the Zhambylenergo administration. We 
insistently ask you that the issue of reorganizing the structure 
of the power industry in south Kazakhstan be canceled until the 
economic and financial situation stabilizes and the power supply 
to the region is made steadier. The construction of a 
high-voltage power line to carry cheap electricity from the 
north to the south of Kazakhstan is a priority issue in 
accomplishing the stabilization of the financial and economic 
situation of the power industry and a steady supply to the three 
oblasts of south Kazakhstan in which more than one-third of the 
economic potential of the republic is concentrated." 
  Would it not be better to invest all the funds to be spent 
for the reform into building this line? For the sake of 
fairness, stresses G. Knyshev, we must note that among the 
reasons for the "divorce" there is an objective one. The current 
tax policy is such that the tax is collected for the budget from 
the entire Yuzhkazenergo. Zhambyl Oblast looses a certain 
proportion of these taxes. All of them go to Almaty and are then 
distributed in a centralized fashion. Would it not be better to 
try and solve this problem at the level of taxation rather than 
slicing through the flesh of a single organism? 
  Following the creation of Zhambylenergo, the establishment 
of 
similar autonomous structures in Kzyl-Orda may become the next 
step. After all, the power industry of Shymkent will not be able 
to maintain them itself because the Kzyl-Orda power group, 
especially TETS-6 [Heat and Electric Power Station-6] meets its 
outlays out of the funds generated by Yuzhkazenergo. In a word, 
the power industry in the south of the republic is on the verge 
of regional or, more precisely, localistic "sovereignization." 
Meanwhile, poor examples are easy to follow.... 
  EDITORIAL NOTE. As a message from the republic 
president to the Kazakh Supreme Council said, the current 
government and heads of oblast administrations do not amount to 
a unified team that is necessary to stabilize the economy and 
enhance reform. A quite convincing confirmation of this is found 
in the situation described by our correspondent, which concerns 
a key, basic sector in the absence of which no other sector can 
exist in a regular manner. It cannot fail to surprise us that 
the partitioning of the power industry, whose strength is 
precisely in the unity of the technological process and the 
opportunity for various enterprises to instantly come to a 
neighbor's rescue, is being devised in one of Kazakhstan's large 
regions with a blessing from Almaty at a time when the 
integrationist initiatives of the republic's president, 
including the creation of the Eurasian Union gain ever more 
supporters beyond the Kazakh borders. However, the exact 
opposite thing will begin to happen here any moment. 
  This shows once again how topical the proposals of the 
president are to bring to an end "confusion and hesitation" 
involving the government, the local authorities, and various 
sectors--in the interest of the economy, the society, and the 
people.

<F P=106> [Article by Alla Okulevich: "Kazakhstan's Oil Reserves"] </F>
  [Text] There was a time when some college professors 
delivering lectures about the oil and gas fields of the USSR to 
their students referred to data taken from foreign sources. 
Within the country, all information was considered secret to 
varying degrees. Time has passed, and secret classifications 
have been removed; however, to this day we have been getting 
only disjointed information. I would like to remedy this 
situation to a degree and provide for your attention information 
on the general condition of the Kazakh oil and gas industry. 
  The Kazakh Republic has recoverable oil reserves of 2.1 
billion tonnes, condensate reserves of 0.7 billion tonnes, and 
gas reserves of 1.7 trillion cubic meters. 
  Some 26 million tonnes of oil and condensate and 8.1 billion 
cubic meters of natural gas were produced in 1992. In 1993, 
production fell to 22 million tonnes of oil and condensate and 
6.5 billion cubic meters of gas. 
  Consumption stood at the level of 23 million tonnes of oil 
and 20 billion cubic meters of gas. 
  For comparison: Nigeria, Venezuela, and Mexico have similar 
levels of reserves. However, Mexico produces approximately six 
times more than Kazakhstan, Venezuela--four times more, and 
Nigeria--three times more. 
  The bulk of the proven reserves of oil and gas and 
hypothetical reserves are located in the western part of 
Kazakhstan: in Mangistau, Atyrau, West Kazakhstan, and 
Aktyubinsk Oblasts; small reserves exist in Kzyl-Orda Oblast. 
  The reserves are distributed among 160 fields. However, only 
58 fields are producing (10 of these fields hold about 80 
percent of all reserves). The rest are not worked because they 
fall into the category of resource fields (in keeping with the 
Soviet system of reserve evaluation). It is possible that some 
of these fields may be reclassified as profitable, and their 
development may begin if they are reevaluated in keeping with 
the American system. 
  Hypothetical reserves of oil are estimated to be 4,475 
million tonnes on land and 3.5 billion tonnes on the shelf of 
the Caspian Sea; hypothetical reserves of gas--5.9 and 2.0 
trillion cubic meters, respectively, and hypothetical reserves 
of condensate--1,635 million tonnes. These reserves have been 
calculated for five oil-and gas-bearing basins. In addition, 
there are nine sedimentation basins with oil and gas prospects 
in the territory of Kazakhstan. This is a very important factor 
because at present about 90 percent of all reserves are used for 
development, and it is necessary to vigorously conduct 
prospecting that at present is being gradually wound down for 
lack of funds. 
  The fields are developed by two state holding companies with 
the resources of territorial production associations. Some 
fields, including the largest in Kazakhstan, Tengiz, have been 
transferred for development to joint ventures with foreign 
participation. Small fields that have not been developed 
previously have been transferred to the jurisdiction of local 
administrations. 
  Kazakhstan has three oil refineries: in Atyrau (using oil 
from Kazakhstan), in Pavlodar (using oil from Russia), and in 
Shymkent (using oil from Russia and Kazakhstan), as well as two 
gas processing plants. However, the capacity of these plants and 
the assortment of products manufactured by them are by far not 
enough to meet the needs of the republic (their output meets 
only slightly more than 70 percent of the republic's needs). 
  Take a look at the map of Kazakhstan. Oil production is 
concentrated in the western part of the republic whereas two of 
the main, relatively modern oil refineries are located in the 
eastern part. The pipeline that feeds these oil refineries comes 
from West Siberia along the Pavlodar-Shymkent line and then on 
to Central Asia. To be sure, a pipeline from the Kumkor field 
(Kzyl-Orda Oblast), which delivers about 1 million tonnes of oil 
to the Shymkent oil refinery is connected to the former 
pipeline. For a number of reasons, the Pavlodar Oil Refinery is 
idle most of the time at present, whereas the Shymkent Oil 
Refinery operates at hardly one-half of its capacity. 
  Yet another oil refinery in Atyrau has a stable supply of 
raw 
materials. However, it has long since become worn-out and 
obsolete (the depth of refining comes to 56 percent and is at 
the levels of the 1950's), while it is capable of processing 
only about 5 million tonnes of raw material a year. 
  No oil refinery in Kazakhstan produces industrial oils, 
although we do have fields with very valuable oil that is 
shipped away as far as Yaroslavl specifically to produce oils. 
  Out of 22 million tonnes of oil produced last year, only 6 
million tons were used within the republic. Where does the rest 
of the oil go? 
  Some of the oil from Mangistau and Atyrau is used at the 
Atyrau Oil Refinery; about 5 million tonnes is exported to 
faraway foreign countries. Small amounts are delivered to CIS 
countries, including up to 2 million tonnes, which in better 
years were transported through the port of Aktau to Baku and 
Makhachkala; a large proportion goes to Russia. 
  Therefore, the overall picture appears as follows: On the 
pattern created in the times of the USSR, the entire flow of oil 
and gas moved from east to west. Small hoses branched off this 
stream in order to meet the needs of republics. It was not 
important whether these republics had oil of their 
own--everything was subordinated to the overall pattern. With 
its own oil available, Kazakhstan was forced to use Siberian oil 
while pumping further west its own oil located closer to the 
western borders of the USSR. 
  The Kazakh oil and gas complex has been fully integrated 
with 
that of Russia. This is why we cannot produce more oil at the 
fields even though we have an opportunity to do so. For this 
reason, Kazakhstan, which has large oil reserves and produces 22 
million tonnes a year, and in previous years up to 27 million 
tonnes, cannot provide refinery products for itself. This fact 
is at the very least surprising. 
  Now that the readers have a general idea of the oil and gas 
complex, I can offer something like a conclusion with which some 
might not agree. 
  Kazakhstan has a very disadvantageous location, which is 
designated in the English language by the very felicitous and 
precise term "land-locked" [word published in English]; this can 
be translated as "locked by land." The significance of this for 
the oil and gas industries is tremendous because in this case 
access to hard-currency markets is much more complicated. 
  The reason hampering the development of the oil and gas 
industries is found in the very structure of the oil and gas 
complex or, more precisely, the way in which it developed during 
Soviet times: It is comprehensive integration, which was quite 
logical and perhaps justified at one time. However, the further 
continuation of this structure and this situation makes it 
possible for third countries, including Russia and Turkey, to 
bring pressure to bear on Kazakhstan in order to achieve their 
objectives. The issue of economic independence remains open 
under such circumstances whereby other states have levers for 
the most powerful economic influence at their disposal.

  [Text] To implement the president's Decree on Further 
Improvement of Land Relations, the Cabinet of Ministers has 
adopted the procedure for individuals and legal entities of the 
republic to buy and sell the right of heritable life possession, 
use, or lease of plots of land. The State Committee for Land 
Relations and Land Development has been ordered to make the 
necessary adjustments in the base rates of the appraised sale 
value of these rights on the basis of the data of the state 
statistical service on the overall level of inflation. 
  Heads of local administrations, individuals, and legal 
entities (excepting state agricultural enterprises) of the 
republic may be sellers of the right of heritable life 
possession, use, or lease of plots of land, and citizens of the 
republic may be buyers. 
  A right of heritable life possession of land is purchased 
pursuant to Article 48, paragraph 3, of the republic Land Code 
and point 5 of the president's 24 January 1994 decree "On 
Certain Aspects of Regulating Land Relations." Legal entities of 
the republic (excepting state agricultural enterprises) may also 
purchase the right to use or lease a plot of land. 
  Foreign legal entities and individuals are granted plots of 
land for temporary use on a lease basis pursuant to the 
regulation on the procedure for granting the use of land to 
joint ventures, international associations and organizations, 
and foreign legal entities and individuals, to perform an 
activity on the territory of the republic, as set forth in the 
Supreme Soviet decree dated 3 July 1992. 
  Citizens of the republic are granted without compensation 
the 
right of heritable life possession of land to operate a peasant 
farm or private farm, for market gardening, and for construction 
of a private dwelling or dacha within the limits of the quota 
established for the respective use, and the right of heritable 
life possession of land in excess of those quotas may be 
purchased from the head of the local administration. 
  Local representative and executive bodies fix the size of 
plots of land to which individuals may be granted the right of 
heritable life possession for these purposes without 
compensation. 
  Individuals who, when the president's 5 April 1994 decree 
"On 
Further Improvement of Land Relations" took effect held plots of 
land whose size exceeds that quota retain in all cases the right 
of heritable life possession of the portion of the plot of land 
that exceeds that quota. 
  Individuals who previously acquired heritable life 
possession 
of plots of land to operate a peasant or private farm, for 
market gardening, or for construction of a private dwelling or 
dacha may sell to other individuals and legal entities of the 
republic their right of possession of plots whose size does not 
exceed the established quota. 
  In cases when the total area of plots of land exceeds that 
quota, before conducting a sales transaction individuals must 
buy from the head of the local administration the right of 
possession of the portion of the plot that exceeds the 
established quota. 
  Individuals granted land to operate a private farm, for 
market gardening, or for construction of a private dwelling or 
dacha may sell the right of heritable life possession of a 
portion of the plot. Use of that portion of the plot must 
conform to current legislation. 
  Individuals and legal entities of the republic who have been 
granted use of plots of land or have leased them for 
nonagricultural purposes (except for the purposes of 
construction of a private dwelling or dacha) may sell that right 
to individuals and legal entities of the republic only when they 
have purchased that right from the head of the local 
administration. 
  On acquiring the right of ownership to immovable property, 
including unfinished construction projects, the individual or 
legal entity acquires at the same time, by virtue of the 
purchase, the right of possession, use, or lease of the plot of 
land on which the property acquired is located. In case of 
privatization of immovable nonagricultural property, including 
unfinished construction projects, the individual or legal entity 
at the same time acquires the right of use or lease of the plot 
of land on which the property acquired is located, pursuant to 
the procedure established in a decree of the Cabinet of 
Ministers dated 9 March 1994. 
  To conduct a sales transaction, the seller files with the 
regional agency of the State Committee for Land Relations and 
Land Development a statement of intent to sell his right to the 
plot of land and the buyer a statement of his intent to buy that 
right. 
  The regional agency of the State Committee for Land 
Relations 
and Land Development verifies that the landowner or land user 
has documents certifying the right to use the plot of land, 
measures more precisely the actual boundaries and area of the 
plot of land, and also defines the terms of sale of the right 
and its value. In cases of a discrepancy between the actual size 
and boundaries of the plot and those indicated in documents, the 
remeasurement data are duly submitted for consideration and 
approval of the head of the local administration. 
  The costs related to determining the value and terms of sale 
of the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of 
plots of land shall be paid by the purchaser at the current unit 
rates for the jobs performed, payable to the special budget 
account of the regional agency of the State Committee for Land 
Relations and Land Development which did the appraisal of these 
rights. 
  The transaction of the sale of the right of heritable life 
possession, use, or lease of a plot of land between the seller 
and buyer takes the form of a sales contract. The map (sketch) 
of that plot is appended to the contract. 
  The right of heritable life possession, use, or lease passes 
from the seller to the buyer when the regional agency of the 
State Committee for Land Relations and Land Development 
registers the notarized sales contract. 
  Transactions involving the right of heritable life 
possession, use, or lease of plots of land may be conducted 
provided there are no land disputes concerning the plots and no 
other impediments to conclusion of the transaction established 
by legislation. 
  Suits to invalidate the sale of the right of heritable life 
possession, use, or lease of plots of land are taken up in the 
courts. 
  When the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease 
of 
plots of land is sold, taxation and collection of the state duty 
are governed by republic legislation. 
  The notarized sales contract is the basis on which the buyer 
prepares and duly files the document certifying the right of 
heritable life possession, use, or lease of the plot of land. 
  The purpose for which the plot of land is to be used may not 
be altered without consent of the head of the local 
administration. The document issued previously to the seller 
certifying his right to the plot of land is terminated. The 
decree has determined the appraised value of the right of 
heritable life possession of a plot of land for operating a 
peasant farm. 
  Plots located on land dedicated to agriculture in the steppe 
and arid-steppe zones in the plains will cost from 28 to 11,100 
tenge per hectare, depending on the soil quality rating. 
  Plots located on farmland in the semidesert, desert, and 
foothill-desert areas are valued between 28 and 2800 tenge per 
hectare, depending on the soil quality rating. 
  The appraised value of the right of heritable life 
possession 
of plots granted for operating a private farm, for construction 
of a private dwelling or dacha, or for market gardening, 
including land occupied by structures, is fixed at 300 tenge per 
0.01 hectares. 
  The appraised value of the right of heritable life 
possession 
of plots of land located within city limits or a zone subject to 
special urban planning regulation is multiplied by a factor of 
1.2 in cities with a population from 100,00 to 250,000; 1.4 when 
the population is between 251,000 and 500,000; 1.6 when the 
population is between 501,000 and one million; and 2 when the 
population exceeds one million. 
  Regional agencies of the State Committee for Land Relations 
and Land Development have the right to double or reduce by half 
the appraised value of the right of heritable life possession, 
use, or lease of a plot of land depending upon its location, the 
level of building-service equipment, and the level of public 
amenities of the area, development of the sector of cultural and 
everyday services to the public, the level of public health and 
hygiene, and other factors. 
  The appraised value of the right of use or lease of a plot 
of 
land is determined in accordance with the procedure whereby an 
individual or legal entity acquires the right of use or lease of 
the plot of land when immovable property for nonagricultural 
purposes is privatized, as set forth in the decree of the 
Cabinet of Ministers dated 9 March 1994. 
  Proceeds which heads of local administrations realize from 
the sale of the right of heritable life possession, use, or 
lease of a plot of land shall be credited to the republic budget. 
  Individuals and legal entities transferring the right of 
heritable life possession, use, or lease of plots of land as 
their contribution to authorized capital of joint stock 
companies, partnerships, or cooperatives, including those with 
foreign participation, relinquish those rights unless the 
charters of those organizations stipulate otherwise. 
  The right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of 
plots of land is reassigned to the aforementioned joint-stock 
companies, partnerships, or cooperatives, including those with 
foreign participation, according to established procedure. 
  The donation or mortgaging of the right of heritable life 
possession of land by individuals and the mortgaging of the 
right to use land by legal entities shall conform to the 
procedure established by the republics's Civil Code and Land 
Code, and by the Law on Mortgages.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladislav Nikolayev, KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA </F>
correspondent: "The Zhayrem Knot: Who Will Cut It?"] 
  [Text] Zhayrem--this is the location of a group of deposits 
of lead, zinc, silver, manganese, and rare metals that is unique 
in scale. There were plans in the USSR Government to create the 
country's largest polymetallic combine here. Zhayrem was a 
directive construction site of the last Soviet five-year plans 
and the main theme of numerous decrees at the highest level. 
Sovereign Kazakhstan organized a free economic zone here, and 
these places were visited repeatedly by foreign firms with 
intentions to invest their capital. But everything ended up with 
the fact that, unexpectedly for the collective of the 
joint-stock company Sary-Arkhapolimetall, 51 percent of the 
shares were sold at a coupon auction. 
  This caused a shock in Zhayrem. Fazylzhan Sadvakasov, the 
president of the joint-stock company, made an urgent flight to 
Almaty, where he tried to have a talk with Goskomimushchestvo 
[State Committee for the Administration of State Property] 
regarding the "hasty" privatization of the enterprise without 
wide publicity and an individual project. An appeal to 
parliament and the president was approved at a stockholders' 
meeting concerning a restoration of violated laws and decrees of 
the government and the provisions of the state committee itself. 
After all, there was no mention of the Zhayrem ore-dressing 
combine in any of the published lists submitted at the auction 
of products. Nor was the cost of the charter fund evaluated, 
which was determined according to the status of April of last 
year and amounted to a total of 16 million tenge, while the real 
current price is tens of millions of dollars. 
  This haste could have been explained if the combine were 
chronically unprofitable and a completely hopeless enterprise. 
But this is not the case at all. For example, last year the 
production of polymetallic ores was halted because of shipment 
distances and the unprofitableness of its processing. But a 
demand for manganese emerged, and the production was reprofiled. 
At that time, 84,000 tonnes were produced, and this year it is 
planned to extract seven times more from the earth. But the main 
thing is that ore consumers were found in Kazakhstan. It was 
requested by the Karmetkombinat, the Yermakovkiy ferro-alloys 
plant, and the Zhambylskiy chemical industry, which gave the 
practically stalled extraction a second wind. Also for the first 
time in recent years, the Sary-Arka Polymetall joint-stock 
company will acquire a solid profit. But in order to cover fully 
the growing demand of the republic for manganese and to come out 
on the foreign market, it is necessary to build a factory at a 
cost of $50 million. And if three times more is added to this to 
erect this kind of a factory for the processing of polymetallic 
ores, then it will be possible to restore the main production 
and make it profitable. 
  Who will invest these sums, when 46 percent of the shares 
were acquired by Kazpotrebsoyuz? If Zhayrem proved to be not 
affordable for the former powerful Ministry of Nonferrous 
Metals, the present Ministry of Industry, and the Aksunkar 
holding company, then where will the resources and forces be 
gotten for the consumer cooperative? Its privatization funds 
bought shares of Zhayrem, as Sadvakasov told me, after 
submitting applications the night before the auction, without 
even becoming familiar with the large economic activity ahead of 
time. 
  However, this is their right, and I have nothing against 
Kazpotrebsoyuz. There is concern only that one of the most 
important enterprises in the republic, which started to come out 
of the crisis independently, will become an object of discord, 
will not get a reliable manager, and, consequently, that no one 
will cut its knot of problems.

<F P=106> [Interview with writer Olzhas Suleymenov, leader of </F>
Kazakhstan's People's Congress, by MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI 
correspondents Sanobar Shermatova and Viktor Kiyanits; place and 
date not given: "The Russian Problem Cannot Be Resolved by 
Reshaping the Borders"] 
  [Text] [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Various political forces in 
Russia are expressing themselves on the problem of Russians in 
Kazakhstan, and the spectrum of opinions is broad--from 
Zhirinovskiy to Solzhenitsyn. How do you, a Kazakh, see this 
problem, and does a solution exist? 
  [Suleymenov] It seems to me that the statements of such an 
authoritative writer as Solzhenitsyn are far more dangerous for 
peace between Russia and Kazakhstan than Zhirinovskiy's 
provincial [mestechkovyy] imperialism. Solzhenitsyn is a 
remarkable writer and a distinguished personality, but 
geopolitics is not his specialty, and he has already proven 
this. It is hardly likely that the problem of Russians in 
Kazakhstan can be resolved by reshaping the borders. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] The principle of the firmness of 
borders now, when the status of Nagornyy Karabakh, Abkhazia, and 
the Dniester region is being decided, is being put to a serious 
test. The states of Central Asia, where the current borders were 
drawn in the 1920's rather arbitrarily, have territorial claims 
on one another, including Russia on Kazakhstan. What should be 
done about this? 
  [Suleymenov] Every forced reshaping of borders--this is a 
lot 
of blood, war, and death. The border problem can be discussed in 
negotiations, and an agreement can be reached. This is a long 
process, but it is the only acceptable one, if we want peace. I 
think that we nevertheless will take Europe's path, where 
borders are rather conditional. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, and 
Uzbekistan took a step in this direction, when they eased 
customs rules. Border questions with Russia can be resolved in 
exactly the same way. One of the main ones--the problem of 
citizenship for Russians and Kazakhs in our countries--can be 
resolved within the framework of a Eurasian Union. This idea is 
now being worked out in Kazakhstan. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you support it? 
  [Suleymenov] The sore subjects of our societies, in 
particular of the Russian-speaking population, can be resolved 
only in the close integration of Kazakhstan and Russia. I do not 
see in this an infringement on Kazakhstan's sovereignty. Just 
exactly as I do not see an infringement on the national dignity 
of Kazakhs in the event that the Russian language receives 
official language status. 
  [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you consider this practical? 
  [Suleymenov] Why not? The ratio of the Kazakh and Slavic 
populations in Kazakhstan is almost proportional; therefore, it 
is quite logical that the two languages should have official 
status. No sensible person will reject the language that he 
knows. And practically every Kazakh speaks Russian. Why and to 
what purpose should we reject the Russian language, which gives 
us definite advantages in the sphere of culture and 
international relations? Kazakhstan and Russia are fated to live 
as neighbors, and it depends on us, Kazakhs, Russians, all 
citizens, whether it will be at odds or well and in harmony.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gazis Yesmukanov by Viktoriya Nartova; place </F>
and date not given: "The Main Cause of Emigration Is Economic 
Instability"] 
  [Text] Problems of the migration of the population 
have become very urgent for Kazakhstan. The migration processes 
occurring in the republic today and their prospects are 
described for PANORAMA by Gazis Yesmukanov, chairman of the 
republic Migration Department. 
  "The Emigration Act was adopted in the republic in June 
1992, 
and the need for the creation of a department to execute this 
law arose. Originally the department was called upon to assist 
the resettlement of those compatriots that were living abroad 
and that wished to return to their historical home. 
  "Today, when the process of population migration is becoming 
a most urgent problem of the state, the department is dealing 
with problems of population migration as a whole. 
  "The departure of significant numbers of the population from 
Kazakhstan had been observed as of the 1960's. But, this process 
has assumed considerable proportions in recent years. The 
migration result last year swallowed up, it may be said, the 
natural population increase and the influx of population into 
the republic: The population of Kazakhstan declined by 60,000. 
This phenomenon cannot be called normal, and it is with good 
reason that it is causing concern in the leadership of the 
republic. 
  "The greatest outflow of the population is observed in such 
oblasts as Almaty, Mangistau, Pavlodar, and Karaganda, that is, 
in oblasts where industry is most developed. The population of 
German nationality, in the main, is leaving oblasts with a 
developed agriculture--Kokshetau and Akmolina." 
  [Nartova] What, in your view, is the main reason for the 
population's departure? 
  [Yesmukanov] Officers of the department conducted a special 
opinion poll in this connection. The results showed that the 
main reason for the departure of the majority of families is the 
economic instability, the uncontrolled prices, and the decline 
in the living standard. Practically all the people see no 
prospect of the situation improving. In addition, many are 
leaving to reunite with relatives that live outside Kazakhstan. 
  According to the poll data, 25 percent of Russians and 70 
percent of Germans are contemplating leaving Kazakhstan. 
  Some 369,000 persons left Kazakhstan in 1992. But I should 
mention that a certain reduction in the numbers of those leaving 
was observed in 1993. A program with which we hope to contain 
and regulate the spontaneous process of population migration and 
to ascertain the reasons for the outflow of population, of the 
able-bodied population with higher education particularly, is 
being devised in the department at this time. 
  [Nartova] You took part in the international conference on 
the problems of refugees in Moscow, tell us about it, please. 
  [Yesmukanov] The conference was held during 6-10 June, and 
problems of refugees and involuntary resettlers on the territory 
of the former USSR and also the prospects of an alleviation of 
their position were discussed. It took place under the aegis of 
the International Peace Foundation, it was opened by Anatoliy 
Karpov, president of the International Association of Peace 
Foundations, and representatives of the UN High Commission for 
Refugees and also leaders of migration services of all 15 former 
republics of the USSR were present. As I have mentioned, the 
problems of the refugees are connected primarily with a 
violation of human rights and infringement of the rights of the 
individual on national grounds. Attention was paid to the flash 
points and the various conflicts flaring up increasingly on the 
territory of the former USSR and also to the significance of UN 
peacekeeping missions in these regions. 
  The summary document was an appeal to the heads of all 
states 
for the adoption of all measures to ensure human rights and 
liberties and suppress all manifestations of aggressive 
nationalism and racial and religious enmity. 
  [Nartova] Speaking of the containment of migration 
processes, 
were any agreements reached with Russia for it is there, after 
all, that the main flow of emigrants from Kazakhstan heads? 
  [Yesmukanov] Truly, Russians constitute 52 percent of those 
leaving the republic. And much will depend on our relations with 
Russia. I visited the Migration Office in Moscow. It has 
accumulated much valuable experience, and we hope that contacts 
between our departments will develop successfully. 
  In March 1994, Presidents Yeltsin and Nazarbayev signed a 
memorandum on the basic principles of the solution of questions 
connected with citizenship and the legal status of citizens of 
the Kazakh Republic living in Russia and Russian citizens living 
on the territory of Kazakhstan. The document specifies a number 
of measures whose preparation and elaboration are geared to the 
resolution of problems in this sphere. Work in this area is 
being performed currently both in Russia and in Kazakhstan. 
  [Nartova] What, in your opinion, does the republic 
government 
need to do to reduce the number of emigrants? 
  [Yesmukanov] Primarily, to improve the economic situation in 
the state and to stabilize prices first and foremost. It is then 
essential to make a number of amendments to the Language Act, 
including to adopt a provision on development of the Russian 
language.

at any time before the elections to repeal its decision to 
nominate a particular person as candidate for deputy. This 
person is deprived of the status of candidate for deputy by the 
appropriate oblast, rayon, or city election commission. A 
political party, rayon or city council of people's deputies, or 
citizens' organ of self-government may submit a proposal to 
register a new candidate to the appropriate oblast, rayon, or 
city election commission before the time period for nominating 
candidates for deputy is up. 
  Registered candidates for deputy also lose their status if 
the political party which nominated them as candidates for 
deputy ceases to operate. 
  A candidate for deputy may at any time before the elections 
withdraw his candidacy. To do this, he petitions the appropriate 
oblast, rayon, or city election commission. 
<H5>  VI. Voter Rolls and Ballots </H5>
<H8>  Article 29. Compiling Voter Rolls </H8>
  The voter roll includes the names of citizens of the 
Republic 
of Uzbekistan who have turned 18 years of age by the day or on 
the day of the elections and live permanently or temporarily on 
the territory of this voting precinct at the moment the roll is 
compiled. 
  Each voter may be included in only one voter roll. 
  A voter roll is made up for each voting precinct by the 
precinct election commission and signed by its chairman and 
secretary. The precinct election commission may recruit 
representatives of the public to participate in the work to 
compile the roll. 
  Khokim's offices of rayons and cities keep records of voters 
and deliver information on voters who live in the corresponding 
territory needed to compile the voter rolls to the precinct 
election commissions. 
  Rolls of voters who are servicemen in military units as well 
as members of the families of servicemen and other voters, if 
they live in rayons where military units are deployed, are made 
up on the basis of data submitted by the commanders of the 
military units. Servicemen who live outside military units are 
included in the voter rolls based on the place of residence on 
general principles. 
  Voter rolls for voting precincts formed at sanatoriums, 
vacation lodges, and hospitals and other inpatient treatment 
institutions are made up on the basis of data submitted by the 
managers of these institutions (departments). 
  The surnames of the voters are indicated in the voter roll 
in 
a manner which is convenient for organizing the voting. 
  The roll includes the surname, name, and patronymic, date of 
birth, and address of each voter. 
<H8>  Article 30. Making Voter Rolls Available to Citizens </H8>
  Voter rolls are made universally available for inspection 15 
days before the elections, and in voting precincts formed at 
sanatoriums, vacation lodges, and hospitals and other inpatient 
treatment institutions and in remote and not easily accessible 
rayons, 7 days before the elections. The precinct election 
commission notifies voters of the place and times for inspecting 
the roll. 
  Citizens are given the opportunity to inspect the voter roll 
at the premises of the precinct election commission. 
<H8>  Article 31. Disputing Voter Rolls </H8>
  Any citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan may petition to 
the 
precinct election commission to correct a mistake or inaccuracy 
in the voter roll. Within 24 hours the precinct election 
commission must check the petition and either eliminate the 
mistake or issue to the petitioner a statement explaining the 
reason for rejecting the petition. 
  The actions and decisions of an election commission may be 
appealed in court in the manner established by law. 
<H8>  Article 32. The Ballot </H8>
  Entered on the ballot in alphabetical order are the 
surnames, 
names, and patronymics of the candidates for deputy along with 
the year of birth, party affiliation, post occupied (type of 
job), and the organ which nominated him as candidate for deputy. 
  The ballot is printed in the state language and, by decision 
of the appropriate oblast, rayon, or city election commission, 
in the languages used by the majority of the population of the 
election district. 
<H8>  Article 33. Obtaining Ballots </H8>
  Precinct election commissions receive ballots from the 
district commissions no later than 3 days before the elections. 
The chairmen, or deputy chairmen or secretaries, of the 
corresponding district and precinct commissions confirm the 
issuance and receipt of the ballots with their signatures. 
<H5>  VII. Voting and Determination of the Results of the Elections </H5>
<H8>  Article 34. The Polling Place </H8>
  The voting is done in specially assigned spaces in which a 
sufficient number of booths or rooms for secret balloting must 
be equipped and ballot boxes have been set up. The ballot boxes 
are set up so that when the people voting approach them they 
must pass through the secret voting booths or rooms. No other 
political actions can be done at the polling place. The precinct 
election commission bears responsibility for setting up the 
polling places and keeping them in the necessary order. 
<H8>  Article 35. The Time and Place for Voting </H8>
  Voting is held on election day from 0700 to 2000 hours. The 
precinct election commission notifies the voters of the time and 
place for voting no later than 10 days before the elections. 
  At voting precincts formed in military units and at 
sanatoriums, vacation lodges, and hospitals and other inpatient 
treatment institutions, as well as in places where citizens are 
in remote and not easily accessible rayons, the precinct 
election commission may declare the voting over at any time, if 
all the voters included in the roll have voted. 
<H8>  Article 36. The Start of Voting </H8>
  On election day the polling place opens when at least 
two-thirds of the members of the precinct election commission 
are present. The chairman in the presence of the members of the 
election commission seals the ballot box, distributes the 
ballots among the members of the election commission, and 
announces the start of voting. The total number of ballots is 
officially registered in a separate document. 
<H8>  Article 37. Establishing the Voter's Identity </H8>
  When a voter comes to the polls to vote, he presents a 
document certifying his identity to a member of the precinct 
election commission and signs the voter roll. After that he is 
issued a ballot. 
  The surnames of the voters who for some reason are not 
included on the voter roll are included in appendices to the 
voter roll on the basis of a document certifying his identity, 
citizenship, and place of residence. 
<H8>  Article 38. The Voting Procedure </H8>
  The ballot is filled out by the person voting in the booth 
or 
room for secret balloting. The presence of persons other than 
the person voting is prohibited when he is filling out the 
ballot. A voter who is unable to fill out the ballot on his own 
has a right to use his discretion and invite a person other than 
a member of the election commission into the booth or room. 
  During elections, the voter crosses out the surnames of the 
candidates on the ballot whom he is voting against. 
  The person voting drops the completed ballot into the ballot 
box. 
  A damaged ballot may be replaced if the voter requests. 
Damaged ballots are to be counted and canceled and stored 
separately. 
  A voter who is unable to be at the place of his residence on 
election day may request an absentee ballot from the precinct 
election commission at the place of his residence, make the 
decisions, and leave the completed absentee ballot in the sealed 
envelope of the election commission. When the absentee ballot is 
received, the voter is entered on the voter roll. The 
corresponding oblast, rayon, or city election commission 
determines the form of the absentee ballot. 
  In cases where certain voters cannot go to the polls to vote 
for health or other reasons, if these voters wish, the precinct 
election commission instructs members of the election commission 
to organize balloting at the place where these voters are. 
<H8>  Article 39. Counting Votes at the Voting Precinct </H8>
  When the voting is over and before the ballot boxes are 
opened, the sealed envelopes with the absentee ballots are 
dropped in the ballot boxes in the presence of the members of 
the precinct commission. All the unused ballots are counted and 
canceled by the precinct election commission. 
  The ballot boxes are opened by the precinct election 
commission after the chairman of the commission has declared the 
voting over. Opening the ballot boxes before the voting is over 
is prohibited. 
  The precinct election commission determines the total number 
of voters at the precinct and the number of voters who received 
ballots and absentee ballots. 
  The votes at the voting precinct are counted by the precinct 
election commission separately for each election district and 
each candidate for deputy in elections to the corresponding 
council of people's deputies. 
  On the basis of the ballots and absentee ballots which are 
in 
the ballot boxes, the commission (for each election district 
within the boundaries of the given voting precinct) determines 
the following: 
  the total number of voters who took part in the voting; 
  the number of votes cast for and the number of votes cast 
against each candidate for deputy; 
  the number of ballots and absentee ballots declared 
invalid. 
  Votes for the names of citizens added by voters to ballots 
and absentee ballots are not counted. 
  Ballots and absentee ballots of the wrong type as well as 
ballots and absentee ballots in which the names of more than one 
candidate were left when voting are declared invalid. When it is 
questionable whether a ballot or absentee ballot is valid or 
not, the question is resolved by the precinct election 
commission through a vote. 
  The results of the vote count are reviewed at the meeting of 
the precinct election commission and recorded in the protocol 
compiled for each election district. The protocol is signed by 
the chairman, the deputy chairman, the secretary, and the other 
members of the commission and submitted to the appropriate 
district election commission. 
<H8>  Article 40. Determining the Results of the Elections in the </H8>
District 
  On the basis of the protocols of the precinct election 
commissions, the district election commission determines the 
following: 
  the total number of voters for the district; 
  the number of voters who received ballots and absentee 
ballots; 
  the number of voters who took part in the voting; 
  the number of votes cast for and the number of votes cast 
against each candidate for deputy; 
  the number of ballots and absentee ballots declared 
invalid. 
  The results of the elections for the district are determined 
at the meeting of the election commission and recorded in a 
protocol. The protocol is signed by the chairman, the deputy 
chairman, the secretary, and the other members of the commission 
and is submitted to the appropriate oblast, rayon, or city 
election commission. 
<H8>  Article 41. Determining the Results of the Elections of </H8>
Deputies 
  The corresponding oblast, rayon, and city election 
commission 
determines the following on the basis of the protocols of 
district election districts received: 
  the total number of voters by oblast, rayon, and city; 
  the number of voters who received ballots and absentee 
ballots; 
  the number of voters who took part in the voting; 
  the number of votes cast for and votes cast against each 
candidate for deputy; 
  the number of ballots and absentee ballots declared 
invalid. 
  A candidate for deputy who in the elections received more 
than half the votes of voters who took part in the voting is 
considered elected. 
  Elections are declared not to have taken place if less than 
half the voters recorded on the voter rolls took part in them. 
  Elections overall for the oblast, rayon, or city or for 
individual districts or for individual voting precincts may be 
declared invalid because of violations permitted during the 
elections which influenced the results of the voting. The 
decision to declare the elections invalid is made by the 
appropriate oblast, rayon, or city election commission and may 
be appealed in court within 10 days from the day the results of 
the elections are published. 
  In the event elections for certain precincts are declared 
invalid by decision of the corresponding oblast, rayon, or city 
election commission, the results of the voting for these 
precincts are excluded from the overall results of the 
elections, under the condition that without them the elections 
as a whole may be declared to have taken place. 
  The appropriate oblast, rayon, or city election commission 
makes up a protocol on the results of the elections and makes 
the decision. 
<H8>  Article 42. The Runoff </H8>
  If more than two candidates for deputy ran for an election 
district and none of them was elected, the district election 
commission makes the decision to hold a runoff in the district 
for the two candidates for deputy who received the largest 
numbers of votes and informs the corresponding oblast, rayon, 
and city election commission and district voters of this 
decision. The runoff is conducted within 2 weeks and the 
requirements of this Law are observed. 
  The candidate for deputy considered elected is the one who 
received the largest number of votes of voters who took part in 
the voting during the runoff in relation to the other candidate, 
given that more than half the voters recorded in the rolls took 
part in the voting and that the number of votes cast for this 
candidate exceeds the number of votes cast against him. 
<H8>  Article 43. Repeat Elections </H8>
  Repeat elections are conducted in the following cases: 
  a) if the elections for the election district are declared 
not to have taken place or invalid; 
  b) if a runoff vote did not allow determination of the 
elected deputy; 
  c) if no more than two candidates for deputy ran for the 
election district and neither one of them was elected; 
  d) if the corresponding oblast, rayon, or city election 
commission refused to register deputies for the reason indicated 
in the third part of Article 45 of this Law. 
  Repeat elections are conducted by the district election 
commission at the instruction of the appropriate oblast, rayon, 
or city election district. And the appropriate oblast, rayon, or 
city election commission may make the decision that it is 
necessary for district and precinct election commissions 
consisting of new members to hold repeat elections. The voting 
is done at the same voting precincts and based on the voter 
rolls compiled for holding the main elections. 
  A person who was nominated and registered as a candidate for 
deputy while the main elections were being held may not be 
nominated as a candidate for deputy to that council of people's 
deputies during repeat elections in this and other districts. 
  Repeat elections are held within no more than a month after 
the main elections. The formation of election commissions, the 
registration of candidates for deputy, and other measures are 
conducted in the manner established by this Law. 
<H8>  Article 44. Conducting Elections of Deputies To Replace </H8>
Those Who Have Withdrawn 
  In the event a particular council of people's deputies 
declares the authority of certain deputies invalid, or in the 
event the deputy is recalled or deputy authority is terminated 
early for other reasons, new elections are held in that election 
district within 2 months from the moment the deputy withdraws. 
The elections are set by that council of people's deputies no 
later than a month before they are to be held and are organized 
in compliance with the requirements of this Law. In this case a 
corresponding oblast, rayon, or city election commission is not 
formed. The district election commission performs its functions. 
The district election commission is formed 25 days and precinct 
election commissions are formed 15 days before the elections. 
Registration of candidates for deputy ends 15 days before the 
elections. 
  In the event a deputy withdraws less than 6 months before 
the 
term of office of the corresponding oblast, rayon, or city 
council of people's deputies is over, elections of a new deputy 
to replace the one who withdrew cannot be held. 
<H5>  VIII. Registration of Deputies and Publication of the </H5>
Results of Elections 
<H8>  Article 45. Registration of Deputies </H8>
  Based on the protocols of the district election commissions 
which it has received, the appropriate oblast, rayon, or city 
election commission registers the elected deputies and informs 
them of this. 
  Persons indicated in the second part of Article 23 of this 
Law who are elected deputies to a particular oblast, rayon, or 
city council of people's deputies must inform the corresponding 
oblast, rayon, or city election commission in writing that they 
are surrendering their duties which are incompatible with the 
status of deputy. 
  No candidates for deputy from a political party may be 
registered as deputies of a particular oblast, rayon, or city 
council of people's deputies if they received a total of less 
than 5 percent of the votes of all the voters of the 
corresponding oblast, rayon, or city which participated in the 
voting. 
<H8>  Article 46. Publication of the Results of the Elections of </H8>
Deputies 
  The corresponding oblast, rayon, or city election commission 
publishes a report on the results of the elections to the 
oblast, rayon, or city council of people's deputies and a list 
of deputies elected within 10 days after the elections; the list 
is in alphabetical order and gives the surnames, names, and 
patronymics, year of birth, party affiliation, post occupied 
(type of job), place of work, place of residence, and the number 
and name of the election district. 
<H5>  IX. Final Provisions </H5>
<H8>  Article 47. Identity Documents and Badge of a Deputy </H8>
  After the list of deputies to the corresponding council of 
people's deputies has been published in the press, the district 
election commission issues a certificate of his election to the 
deputy elected from the district. 
  After the authority of the deputy is confirmed by the 
appropriate council of people's deputies, the certificate of 
election as a deputy issued to him is replaced by an identity 
document of a deputy to the oblast, rayon, or city council of 
people's deputies. The deputy is issued a badge of the 
established type. 
<H8>  Article 48. Expenditures related to making preparations for </H8>

<F P=106> [Decree: "Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic </F>
of Uzbekistan: `Changes in the Retail Prices for Flour and 
Bread'"] 
  [Text] As a result of the increase in the expenditures for 
purchasing, transporting, and processing grain, the Cabinet of 
Ministers decrees: 
  1. To establish, effective 1 June 1994, retail prices for 
flour at the average of 500 som-coupons and for bread at the 
average of 400 som-coupons per kilogram. 
  2. Republic of Uzbekistan Ministry of Finance is to make 
known to the interested ministries and departments the new 
prices for flour and bread, with a consideration of the variety 
of items being produced. 
  3. To consider to be no longer in effect decree of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan Cabinet of Ministers, dated 28 February 
1994, No. 100. 
  [Signed] A. Mutalov, prime minister of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan 
  Tashkent, 30 May 1994 
  At the Republic of Uzbekistan Ministry of Finance, the 
Uzbeksavdo State Association, and Uzbekbirlashuv 
  Taking into consideration the continuing increase in the 
expenditures to purchase and transport food products from abroad 
and to produce and process the republic's own resources, as well 
as the need to protect the domestic market and thwart attempts 
to ship food products illegally beyond the confines of the 
republic, the Uzbeksavdo State Association and Uzbekbirlashuv, 
jointly with the republic's Ministry of Finance, have decided to 
introduce, effective 1 June 1994, the following average retail 
prices for the basic food products, including those for which 
norms are applied: 
  -- flour: 500 som-coupons per kilogram; 
  -- bread (white, coarse, rye): 400 som-coupons. 
  In conformity with Cabinet of Ministers decree No. 360, as 
long ago as July 1993 the decision was made to release the 
prices for the basic food products. By that decision the 
Uzbeksavdo Association and the board of governors of 
Uzbekbirlashuv, jointly with the republic's Ministry of Finance, 
and proceeding from the current market condition and the actual 
expenditures for purchases, were instructed to establish 
flexible prices for a group of food products to which norms 
would be applied: vegetable oil, sugar, tea, and meat. 
  It must be noted that a considerable quantity of food 
products are brought into the republic from the so-called "near 
and far abroad." Moreover, all types of food products are 
purchased at world prices, only in exchange for freely 
convertible currency. For example, one ton of wheat on the world 
market costs $130, which, recomputed at the official rate of 
exchange, is 500,000 som-coupons. Consequently, a kilogram of 
grain, not counting the cost of shipment, costs the state 500 
som-coupons. Therefore, even with the new prices for bread and 
grain it is necessary to set aside from the state budget every 
month subsidies totally more than 28 billion som-coupons. 
  It is also necessary to emphasize that the new prices for 
the 
basic food products in Uzbekistan, if they are recomputed at the 
exchange rate of the Russian ruble, prove to be lower than, for 
example, in Russia or Kyrgyzstan:

  As a result of the increase in the prices of petroleum and 
other fuel resources that are being delivered to the republic, 
and also for purposes of increasing the effectiveness of the use 
of energy resources and guaranteeing the stable operation of the 
branches of the national economy, new retail prices are being 
introduced, effective 1 June 1994, for fuel and energy resources 
and rates for the services of urban and suburban passenger 
transportation:

suburban motor buses: 

general type                per kilometer of trip      17 

with upholstered seats      per kilometer of trip      25 


  In addition, the state sets aside considerable subsidies for 
all the types of energy resources and transportation services 
that were indicated above. For example, with a consideration of 
the new prices and tariffs, in terms of one month's 
expenditures, urban passenger transportation will require 
subsidies each month of no less than one billion som-coupons; 
energy producers, 0.7 billion; gas producers, 8.6 billion; and 
coal producers, 3.6 billion som-coupons. Moreover, in Kazakhstan 
the natural gas that is sold to the population is more expensive 
than in our republic (in terms of Russian rubles) by a factor of 
19.2; and in Kyrgyzstan, by a factor of 23.7. 
  For purposes of preserving social guarantees for the 
population, the republic's government regularly reconsiders and 
increases wages, pensions, scholarships, and other payments. By 
the most recent edict of the President, effective 1 June 1994 
the minimum wages and minimum work pensions are established, 
respectively, at 70,000 and 75,000 som-coupons. Wages in 
organizations financed by the budget and scholarships paid to 
students at institutions of higher learning, technicums, and 
occupational-trade schools have been increased by a factor of 
1.5.
