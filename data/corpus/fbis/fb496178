  [Abstract] A method has been developed for waste-free 
removal of sulfur dioxide from exhaust gases emitted by 
metallurgical plants and power plants into the atmosphere. As 
the sorbent is used sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, either 
of these two compounds being chemically more active than the 
conventionally used analogous calcium compounds. The new method 
is not only almost waste-free but also more efficient, inasmuch 
as up to 95 % or even more of the SO[.sub]2[/] content will 
be removed, and simpler than the conventional one. The processes 
taking place are reaction of the sodium compound with sulfur 
dioxide in the presence of oxygen, which results in formation of 
sodium sulfate and sodium sulfite, followed by reduction of both 
these salts by methane, carbon monoxide, or molecular hydrogen. 
The principal end product is sodium sulfide, which by treatment 
with carbon dioxide and water vapor will be converted into 
sodium carbonate and hydrogen sulfide. A pump feeds sorbent from 
a storage tank into the flue duct for removal of sulfur, 
whereupon the clean exhaust gas pass through a dust trap- 
separator cyclone chamber into the air while the sodium sulfur 
salts are precipitated into an extractor into which also water 
is injected. Their water solution is fed into a centrifuge, from 
where they are loaded for sorbent regeneration while residual 
ash falls out. The equipment in such sorbent regeneration plant 
consists of: 

  -  evaporator 
  -  centrifuge discharging water 
  -  Claus furnace discharging sulfur 
  -  afterburning furnace for sulfur dioxide + hydrogen sulfide 
mixture 
  -  scrubbing chamber 
  -  methane combustion chamber with air injection and 
  -  melting chamber (1200ëC) for sodium sulfur salts 
including 
makeup sodium sulfate 
  -  methane incomplete-combustion chamber with air injection and 
  -  sodium sulfur salts reducing chamber (900ëC) 
  -  carbonizer with carbon dioxide and water vapor injection 
  -  two collector tanks, one for sodium sulfur salts coming in 
from 
the user and one for sodium carbonate going out to the user 
respectively. 

  Inasmuch as installation of such an equipment in every 
plant and 
especially in small ones is costly, regional centralization of 
the treatment is proposed: one sorbent regeneration plant to 
collect on tank trucks sodium sulfur salts from all users in the 
region and to deliver to them on tank trucks regenerated sodium 
carbonate. Such a scheme is demonstrated on a radial grid with 
the sorbent regeneration plant at an optimum location within the 
Tula-Ryazan-Tambov-Lipetsk perimeter. Figures 3; references 10.

Department of Physics Engineering Problems of Power Engineering, 
Russian Academy of Sciences] 
  [Abstract] The principal tasks of the Department of Physics 
Engineering Problems of Power Engineering of the Russian 
Federation Academy of Sciences is to generate knowledge in the 
areas of power generation systems research, thermal physics, 
electrophysics, new power generation processes and technologies, 
and nuclear power engineering safety. Because of the nature of 
its activity, the department maintains close ties with industry, 
and 14 of its 59 members work in industry. The main results of 
the department's activities related to the aforementioned 
research areas during the past 2-3 years may be summarized as 
follows. The department's main achievement in the area of power 
generation systems research has been the development of a theory 
and methods of researching and controlling large power 
generation systems. Members of the department also collaborated 
with the Russian Federation Institute of Power Engineering 
Research, Siberian Power Engineering Institute, and other 
institutions to develop an energy policy for Russia under the 
new economic conditions. The draft policy emphasizes energy 
conservation and development of a Russian Federation Unified 
Electric Power System that would include provisions for 
interaction with the power grids of its neighboring states. The 
primary focus in the area of thermal physics has been on 
studying the thermophysical and electrophysical properties of 
materials over a wide range of state parameters, including 
subjecting those materials to different types of intensive 
energy fluxes. Strong shock waves have been used to compress and 
irreversibly heat materials and then study them at record high 
pressures (tens to hundreds of millions of atmospheres) and 
temperatures (10[.sup]4[/]-10[.sup]6[/] K). A method of 
``adiabatic expansion of shock-compressed metals'' was developed 
and used for the first time in world practice. Among the 
department's accomplishments in the area of electrophysics are 
studies of electromagnetic and electrical fields, electric 
discharges in various media, phenomena occurring in the fine 
structures of solids and at the interfaces of different 
structures, and the interaction of electromagnetic and electric 
fields with the biosphere and infrastructure. The department has 
also been actively involved in creating progressive processes of 
producing electric power, making complete use of fossil fuel, 
conserving energy, and reducing power generation facilities' 
harmful effects on the environment. The department is also 
collaborating with the Joint Institute of High Temperatures to 
develop new-generation steam generators that would put an end to 
Russia's lag in the area of gas turbine engineering. The 
possibilities of using aviation gas turbine engines for power 
generation purposes are also being explored. The department's 
associates have made great strides in the area of improving the 
safety of nuclear power generation by switching from criterial 
dependences to physical modeling of the key processes occurring 
during serious accidents at nuclear power plants. The scientific 
foundations and software for more exact probability analysis of 
the safety of existing and planned nuclear power plants have 
been developed along with an expert system on the radiation 
consequences of the Chernobyl accident. The recent problems of 
financing and organizing scientific research have had a negative 
impact on the status of the experimental base of the 
department's institutes, as have increasing costs for such 
thinks as maintaining and repairing buildings and computer 
equipment and maintenance. The ranks of active and future 
scientists are decreasing, scientific schools that have taken 
decades to create are under threat of collapse, and the influx 
of youth into science has decreased sharply. The department is 
working with the Russian Federation Ministry of Fuel and Energy 
to resolve a number of problems related to developing a state 
fuel and energy program, is participating actively in studies 
regarding a state scientific-technical program entitled 
``Ecologically Pure Power Generation,'' and is involved in 
efforts to integrate the efforts of sectorial and academic 
science for the purpose of resolving the scientific-technical 
problems of power generation. Special attention is being given 
to cooperation between the academy and higher education 
institutions. Inadequate funding is having an adverse effect on 
the department's ability to pay its personnel adequately, and 
the increasing costs of all types of communication is making it 
difficult for the department to maintain its ties with regional 
scientific centers and industrial regions. Figures 3, tables 2.

  [Abstract] The limitations on using available foreign 
CAD/CAM systems, e.g., DUCT-5, UNIGRAPHIX, etc., at most CIS 
enterprises with numerical control (ChPU) equipment and the 
difficulty of designing an individual postprocessor for each 
specific ``machine tool-numerical control system'' complex 
prompted the development of an off-line invariant postprocessor 
(AIP) designed for CAD/CAM programs for numerical control 
equipment. The AIP invariant postprocessor contains a library of 
280 ready-to-use descriptors which encompass virtually the 
entire pool of machine tools at 350 CIS enterprises equipped of 
numerical control equipment. The use of the invariant 
postprocessor for the CAD/CAM system adaptation to numerical 
control equipment is cheaper than developing an individual 
postprocessor by fifty-to-hundredfold while the labor outlays 
for developing an individual descriptor vs. an individual 
postprocessor are lower by 100-200 times. The service personnel 
skill requirements can also be relaxed. The AIP has been adapted 
to the ANVIL-5000, DUCT-5.2, EUKLID, APT, MODAPT, and other 
systems whose processors have a CLDATA-file output. The 
invariant postprocessor has been implemented at a number of 
mechanical engineering enterprises in Russia.

  [Abstract] Development of algorithms of a control system 
for walking machines was examined from positions of optimization 
of periodic controllable systems with variable relations. During 
this, consideration of dynamic processes caused by a change of 
the imposed connections greatly improved the quality of 
algorithms of control and, especially, decreased loadings on 
control mechanisms. Mathematical modelling of the movement of a 
machine with biomechanical mesurements of parameters of human 
walking were presented and discussed. Conclusions of other 
authors concerning this question were discussed. References 47:

  [Abstract] Although limited use has been found in sectors 
such as machine building, aerospace, shipbuilding, gas-and-oil 
work, and medicine for alloys with shape memory, broader use of 
such alloys has been held back by the slow development of new 
approaches to the design of structures based on such memory. In 
this, the first in a series of articles to be published by 
ZAVODSKAYA LABORATORIYA on the mechanics of deformation of 
materials with shape memory in the thermoelastic region, the 
researchers address the problem of creating a generalized 
thermomechanical diagram of alloys with shape memory, i.e., 
_s_[.sub]R[/] = f(_e_[.sub]S[/]), which describes the 
relationship between, on the one hand, reactive stresses 
generated during the formation of a structure as a result of 
thermomechanical recovery and, on the other, the magnitude of a 
given deformation of incomplete recovery. The researchers point 
out that the return stresses in a structural element with shape 
memory are not a function of the means through which the return 
process is effected; rather they are determined solely by the 
type and magnitude of deformation of incomplete recovery during 
contact with the joined part. A generalized thermomechanical 
diagram obtained under conditions of absolutely rigid resistance 
turns out to be a universal curve of deformation that describes 
the process of the thermomechanical return of a structural 
element for an entire range of a deformation. Figures 5, 
references 3 (Russian).

  [Abstract] A model of LAS temperature fluctuation field 
spectra and an analogous model of wind velocity fluctuation 
spectra were defined using parameters estimated from independent 
measurements. The two models were then employed to calculate the 
scattering of ultra-short and acoustic waves in the stratosphere 
at small angles, where 0 &lt; _u_ &lt;&lt; ã/2. The 
calculations 
from these two models were then compared with those obtained 
from the model of scattering by locally isotropic turbulence 
with the Kolmogorov spectrum. This problem has a direct bearing 
on wave propagation over the horizon, in the shadow region, 
where the diffraction field is negligible. For both of the LAS 
models, the scattering cross-section increases proportionally to 
the wavelength of incident radiation. It was shown that 
accounting for actual temperature and wind velocity fluctuation 
spectra and anisotropy increases the scattering cross-section in 
the mirror direction in comparison with the locally isotropic 
turbulence model, for which this scattering value was -11/3. 
This increase is especially significant for long acoustic waves. 
It was also shown that the scattering of sound by wind velocity 
fluctuations plays a more significant role than scattering by 
temperature fluctuations. The potential increase in acoustic 
pulse length during scattering was estimated. It should be noted 
that the calculations of the effect of anisotropy and spectral 
behavior presented in the tables are extremely preliminary and 
require subsequent experimental refinement. The models described 
can serve as a basis for planning and interpreting experiments 
on the remote sounding of atmospheric structures. Figures 2, 
tables 2; references 21: 7 Russian, 14 Western.

  [Abstract] Amplitude-time responses were measured for 
optical pulses vertically propagated through stratified clouds. 
ATR measurements were complemented by a sounding of the optical 
and microphysical parameters of the cloud cover. The experiments 
were carried out in the fall of 1988 and the spring of 1989 in 
the area around the Typhoon Production Association's 
high-altitude weather station near Obninsk. Twelve series of 
measurements under different types of cloud cover were carried 
out. The laser radiation source was carried on board an 
Ilyushin-14 aircraft and had a wavelength of 0.532 æm, a beam 
divergence of 10ë, a pulse length of 10 ns, and a repetition 
rate of 10 Hz. The plane, which flew above the clouds at an 
altitude of 2-4 km, was guided to the observation point by a 
Meteorite-2 meteorological radar station. The propagated 
radiation was recorded by a ground-based 4-channel lens system 
with a focal length of 160-300 mm, an aperture diameter of 120 
mm, and receiving angles set at 5 and 20ë. The time 
resolution of the transmission/receiving system equaled 30 ns. 
Comparison of the ATR data with numerical calculations performed 
using the Monte Carlo method showed that a cloud stratification 
model constructed as a set of homogeneous layers with a 
scattering indicatrix typical for stratified clouds allowed for 
a satisfactory interpretation of the experimental data. The 
fundamental parameter determining ATR is the optical thickness 
of the cloud cover. The variations in ATR observed for different 
optical thicknesses (_t_ ó 25) were attributed to the 
combined 
effects of various geometrical parameters such as distance from 
source to receiver, cloud ceiling altitude, thickness of the 
cloud strata, and so forth. Figures 4, tables 2; references 12:

  [Abstract] A precise theory of light scattering by 
spheroidal particles was used to study the unique 
characteristics of radiation scattering by atmospheric aerosol. 
The new method utilizes the separation of variables to solve the 
problem of electromagnetic plane wave diffraction by a 
homogeneous spheroid and is considerably more efficient from a 
computational standpoint than the method devised by Asano and 
Yamamoto. The expressions for scattered radiation intensity are 
elaborated within the framework of a rigorous solution for both 
severely oblate and severely prolate spheroids. Numerical 
results obtained for ice particles with different shapes and 
wave lengths of 10.6 æm are discussed. On the basis of the 
adduced calculations, it was concluded that the average light 
scattering indicatrix is smoother for oblate than for prolate 
particles. As a rule, the albedo of the oblate particles was 
somewhat greater than for prolate particles of the same volume. 
Changing the imaginary part of the index of refraction for the 
substance of the particles has virtually no bearing on the 
behavior of the normalized functions of the scattering 
indicatrix, but does affect the magnitude of the particle 
albedo. The polarization of the scattered radiation varies 
markedly with changes in particle shape. However, in some cases, 
prolate spheroids could be substituted for infinite circular 
cylinders. The findings of this study provide a basis for 
conducting optical atmospheric sounding experiments that would 
make it possible to determine the degree of sphericity of the 
scattering particles and their spatial orientation. Figures 4, 
tables 2; references 26: 18 Russian, 8 Western.

Protection Institute at the Moldova Republic Academy of 
Sciences, `Invitation to Cooperation'] 
  [Text] The long established links among the scientists, 
including our field of biological plant protection, have 
weakened, and a number of cases became broken with the formation 
of many sovereign states on the territory of the former union. 
The All-Union Institute of Biological Plant Protection Methods 
which once was a head institute in the USSR did not escape this 
fate. After becoming subordinated to the Moldova Republic 
Academy of Sciences, it is naturally restructuring its 
activities and in no way does it pretend to play the former role 
of the biological method curator in the CIS countries. Yet it 
would be incorrect to regard this large scientific establishment 
to have been ``sliced off.'' The staff, a lot of scientific work 
in progress, and modern equipment still remain, and the plans 
outlined in the past are still being implemented. 
  We should reiterate everything the institute has done in 
recent years. 
  Basic research into the faunistics and taxonomy of a number 
of predators and agricultural crop parasites has been carried 
out, individual methods of using natural entomophagan 
populations have been substantiated, and a range of methods of 
reconstructing the agrobiocenosis of the fruit orchard which 
facilitate the preservation of natural populations of the 
natural pest enemies and increase their efficiency has been 
developed. 
  A comprehensive pesticide-free system of vegetable crop 
protection in enclosed soil using entomophagans and 
microbiological facilities has been developed and is being 
implemented. 
  The institute proposed methods of large-scale phytophagan 
breeding and production of effective entomophagan and viral 
preparations on their basis and developed original resources for 
producing Encarsia, Phytoseiulus, Cecidomyiidae carnivora, 
Amblyseius, and Aphidius; techniques for producing, 
storing, and applying Trichogramma and the methods of 
mass breeding and introduction of perillus and 
podizius have been proposed. 
  New active strains of entomopathogenic fungi, antagonist 
fungi, and hyperparasites and carnivorous pathogenic weed fungi 
have been isolated and regulations have been developed for 
production of biological preparations and application 
technologies for some of them in a series of agricultural crops; 
new baculovirus strains have been isolated and production 
regulations have been developed for viral preparations against 
cotton and cabbage cutworm and American white butterfly. 
  Sexual pheromones of more than 70 species of harmful insects 
have been isolated and production of synthetic pheromones has 
been set up for more than 15 species of agricultural crop pests; 
technologies and their applications have been developed for the 
apple worm and grape leaf roller moth as well as a method of 
pheromone monitoring for observing and indicating the pest 
development. 
  Based on the research, 36 methodological manuals and 
recommendations and more than 300 articles have been printed, 26 
collections on various issues of biological methods have been 
published, and 41 patents have been granted. 
  The VNIIBMZR was given the new name of the Institute of 
Biological Plant Protection by the 15 Feb 92 Decree of the 
President of the Republic of Moldova and incorporated into the 
Moldovan Academy of Sciences. Its mission statement was 
formulated as ``development of the theoretical foundation of 
biological methods and ecologically safe systems of integrated 
plant protection and development of biological facilities and 
technologies for their application.'' 
  The institute will rely on work in progress and the of 
totality world experience in continuing the study of the biology 
and ecology of the principal phytophagan and entomophagan types, 
ways of maintaining, introducing, and activating natural 
populations of friendly insects, development of the mass 
breeding technologies for the effective species of predators, 
parasites, and phytophagan for the production of viral 
insecticides and microbial preparations and identification of 
new microorganism and virus strains. 
  We are also speeding up efforts relating to pheromones and 
the development of the methods of phytosanitary inspection and 
monitoring systems. Individual techniques will be formulated in 
the form of environmentally safe systems of integrated plant 
protection from pests and diseases on the basis of assessing the 
effect of the new technologies. 
  The institute possesses an adequate material and technical 
base and its work sites cover approximately 14,000 
m[.sup]2[/], 59 chambers for insect breeding, 7 climate 
chambers, and a data processing room with computers. 
  We are still interested in strengthening cooperation with 
scientists and production experts from other CIS countries and

  [Text] The republic's biolaboratory is involved in the 
production and implementation of biological facilities in the 
republic. The outcome of this effort speaks for itself: in 1992, 
biological treatment was carried out in 42 Tatarstan rayons with 
an area of 820,000 ha. Bactorodencide was used most frequently 
on open soil. The preparation was used on an area of 600,000 ha 
in 25 rayons, predominantly on winter cereal crops, perennial 
grass, and in orchards. The total area of its application in 
warehouse rooms and greenhouses exceeded 107,000 ha and in the 
private sector--7,000 ha. 
  Rhizoplan testing was continued on cereal crop plantings 
over 
an area of 167,500 ha and on other crops in 27 rayons in the 
republic. The effect of the preparation on potatoes was examined 
by experts from the laboratory together with scientists from the 
Niva Scientific Technical Association. At first, they treated 
the tubers, then the preparation was applied to vegetating 
plants. The outcome was positive. 
  The following microbiological preparations were used: 
lepidocide on vegetable crops and in gardens and bitoxybacillin 
primarily on potatoes. Curtene and belocide were tested for the 
first time against the Colorado beetle in the private sector. 
  Commercial breeding of Trichogramma conducted 
along four lines has been set up in the republic. Large-scale 
production of the entomophagan is carried out between April and 
August. The Trichogramma is marketed to enterprises 
in 30 rayons where it is introduced into gardens, plantings of 
peas and perennial grasses and vegetable crops over a total area 
of 150 ha. Production of aphid lion and Encarsia is 
continuing for open and protected soil; it is being conducted by 
the Republican Laboratory and Greenhouse Integrated Productions. 
  The assortment of biological facilities and the scope of 
their application are expanding every year. In addition to 
producing Trichodermin, Phytoseiulus, Aphidius 
gallcieae, and aphid lion, Cuban cycloneda and 
Amblyseius were also bred during the last year. A 
department for producing preparations against downy mildew is 
being equipped. 
  The production of entomophagan at greenhouse integrated 
enterprises makes it possible to produce the first yield of 
vegetable and produce crops virtually without chemical 
treatment. The integrated enterprises are partially marketing 
their biological resources to subsidiary plots at commercial 
enterprises. 
  The staff of the biolaboratory together with the experts 
from 
the enterprises are engaged in efforts to identify useful 
insects and preserve them in the areas near beehives as well as 
prepare regulation for canceling chemical treatment. Due to the 
considerable spread of female aphids, aphid lions, aphidius, 
ground beetles, tachyna flies, and other representatives of 
useful entomophagan in nature, such chemical treatment was 
canceled over an area of over 252,000 ha.

  [Abstract] The property of somatostatin (SST)--a 
biologically active tetradecapeptide produced mostly by the 
hypothalamus and adrenalin gland's and digestive tract's 
D-cells--to inhibit the secretion of a number of hormones, and 
the autoimmune reaction to SST which induces anabolic processes 
and stimulates the growth of agricultural animals prompted 
attempts to clone the synthetic gene of somatostatin in a single 
translation frame with the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase 
(cat) gene so that parts of the hybrid protein would be 
connected through the Met residue. The synthetic SST gene was 
cloned into the pBR325 plasmid vector at the EcoRI 
and BamHI restrictase sites. As a result, expressing 
vector systems which ensure constitutive or induced synthesis of 
hybrid CAT-SST proteins at a 5-10% level of the total cell 
proteins in E. coli strains with an inhibited 
proteinase activity were created. The hybrid protein was 
segmented by cyanogen bromide, and SST was isolated by gel 
filtration and reverse phase chromatography. It is noted that 
the specific biological and immunological activity of purified 
and renatured SST matches that of natural SST. The bacterial 
SST-producing strains developed as a result of the effort and 
the methods of SST isolation from the bacterial mass make it 
possible to obtain 98% pure somatostatin with a yield of 
approximately 1 mg/l. The resulting recombinant SST is 
comparable to the commercial product synthesized by Serva. The 
authors are grateful to I.S. Komolov, A.A. Bulatov, and G.P. 
Yelizarova for biological activity studies and to M.L. Khodun 
for immunological testing. Figures 8; tables 1; references 24: 8

  [Abstract] An earlier study of the structural-functional 
organization of the molecule of such opioid neuropeptides as 
Met- and Leu-enkephalin, _a_-, _g_-, ø-, and 
_b_-endorphins, 
etc., is continued, and an attempt is made to solve the primal 
and inverse structural problems of another compound in this 
series--adrenorphin--an octapeptide whose N-terminal segment has 
the Met-enkephalin sequence. The adrenorphin molecule's optimum 
conformational states are determined on the basis of the 
conformational theory of native peptides and the corresponding 
analysis method. The amino acid sequence of adrenorphin was 
treated as [Met[.sup]5[/]]-enkephalin with a tripeptide 
fragment attached to its C-terminal. The relative conformation 
energy of the tripeptide fragment, the relative energy and 
energy contributions of nonvalent, electrostatic, and torsional 
interactions of adrenorphin's optimum conformations, the 
geometrical parameters of the preferable conformations of 
various shapes of the peptide skeleton, and the relative energy 
of optimum adrenorphin conformations and its synthetic analogues 
are summarized. These synthetic analogues are examined; each of 
them may assume a rather limited number of conformations 
(sometimes only one) from the set of low-energy conformations 
and, consequently, physiologically active spatial forms of the 
native peptide. The proposed analogues differ from the native 
peptide only by their conformational abilities and as a group, 
are consistent with the structural-functional organization of 
the native molecule. Tables 4; references 20: 15 Russian, 5 
Western.

  [Abstract] The difficulty of chemical enzymatic synthesis 
and cloning of artificial oligomer genes of short peptides, 
e.g., oxytocin, by traditional methods, probably due to the fact 
that recurrent sequences in DNA may cause varying recombinant 
restructuring, prompted attempts to use different codons in the 
synthesized structures in order to diminish the homology of 
individual polynucleotide segments for encoding the same amino 
acids. To this end, a vector obtained by splitting the pFPCP10 
plasmid by the BamHI and EcoRI restrictase 
was used for cloning the B/E gene and a vector 
obtained by splitting the pTE2IL3 plasmid by the 
HindIII and EcoRI restrictase was used for 
cloning the H/E gene. Deletions caused by ruptures in 
one of the plasmid DNA chains were noted in the experiment to 
clone a synthetic oxytocin trimer gene; it is stressed that 
these deletions are much less frequent when cloning a 
covalent-closed cyclical two-stranded DNA. These recurrent gene 
sequence cloning feature may also be observed in other cases. It 
is speculated that the difficulties related to these deletions 
or recombinations could be overcome by using the techniques 
which were verified in this study. Figures 2; references 7: 4

  [Abstract] Derivativesof endotoxin A, in which the recept 
or-recognizing domain is absent, were nontoxic for eukaryotic 
cells. Such proteins may be used as a catalytic component of 
immunotoxins if they are connected with proteins capable of 
recognizing specific receptors of eukaryotic cells. Hybrid 
proteins, which contain, in addition to fragments of endotoxin 
A, either a fragment of protein A of staphylococcus or 
interleukin-2 were used to create proteins which may be used as 
the catalytic components of immunotoxins or as already pepared 
immunotoxin. Analysis of the stability of these hybrid proteins 
and their derivatives showed that all the hybrid proteins except 
one proved to be stable in E. coli cells. Figures 5; references

  [Abstract] The aim of the study was production of 
monoclonal antibodies and their fragments against Thym-1 antigen 
in order to develop, on their base, a diagnosticum, for 
immunohistological study of tumors of the peripheral nervous 
system, to produce a preparation for visualization of these 
tumors and to explain the role of this antigen in proliferative 
processes. Highly purified antibody ICO-10 IgM class against the 
Thy-1 antigen of thymocytes was produced and descri bed. The 
yield from 1 ml of of ascite was 5.3 + or - 1.6 mg. Hydrolysis 
of the monoclonal antibody by pepsin produced a fragment of 
molecular class 150-250 KD with 20 percent yield. Fragments were 
stable and preserved antigen-binding activity after 
modifications. Hydrolysis of the monoclonal antibody by trypsin 
produced fragments with molecular mass of 400 and 600 KDa with 
50 percent yield. IgM fragments were tested on cells by 
cytofluorimetry. The antigen determined by ICO-10 was expressed 
by 5 percent on hyman thymocytes, by 45 percent on mouse 
thymocytes and by 35 percent on EL-4 cells. Figures 7;

  [Abstract] Rat saliva lymphocytes and HeLa cervical 
carcinoma cells cultured in an Igla medium with 10% cattle 
serum were incorporated into polyacrylamide microspheres to 
protect the cells from physical damage during cytometric 
testing. The specimens were used to directly estimate the extent 
to which DNA is shielded by proteins contained in the chromatin 
from binding to the DNA- specific fluorescent stains used in 
flow cytometry. It was extremely important that the spheres be 
permeable by protein molecules, as this would make the method 
much more versatile. It was shown that the method described 
makes it possible to fractionate the cells and preserve their 
residual components in the form of individual particles of 
cellular dimension. By incorporating them into the gel 
microspheres, the macromolecular complexes are protected from 
physical damage during the course of routine laboratory testing 
with enzymes, antibodies, and flow cytometry. Figures 2;

  [Abstract] The high volume of asparagine family amino acid 
production in the biotechnology industry--estimated in billions 
of dollars--and the lack of a vector-host system for molecular 
gene cloning in corynebacteria which held back the use of 
genetic engineering methods for developing corynebacterial 
producing strains prompted attempts to clone the lysC gene from 
Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 1302, a gene which 
encodes aspartokinase--a key enzyme in the lysin biosynthesis in 
corynebacteria--due to the higher activity of this wild type of 
enzyme compared to the enzyme encoded by the mutant gene which 
had been cloned earlier. In so doing, a novel version of a 
bireplicon vector for corynebacteria and E. coli was 
engineered in order to ensure a higher lysC gene expression 
level in the corynebacterial cells. This bireplicon vector was 
constructed on the basis of the pUC19 plasmid and the pBO1 
corynebacterial cryptic plasmid. Encloned gene amplification on 
the new vector increase the aspartokinase activity by sixfold 
compared to the enzyme activity in the nonplasmid wild type 
strain cells. The novel engineered bireplicon vector is capable 
of not only replicating in corynebacterial cells but is also of 
maintaining effective expression of the gene cloned on it.

  [Abstract] The role of human interleukin-1_a_--a 
polypeptide hormone with a molecular weight of approximately 
17.5 kDa which stimulate thymocyte and B-lymphocyte 
proliferation--and known functional differences between human 
interleukin-1_a_ (hIL-1_a_) and hIL-1_b_--very similar 
proteins 
which share a 26% homology and compete for the same 
cellular 
receptors--necessitated an experiment to clone hIL-1_a_ cDNA 
and 
express the fragment of this DNA which encodes the functionally 
mature hIL-1_a_. As a result, the hIL-1_a_ gene was cloned by 
hybridization screening with chemically synthesized 
oligonucleotide probes from the cDNA library. cDNA was 
synthesized on (poly-A[.sup]+[/])-mRNA isolated from human 
donor blood monocytes induced by additions of concanavalin and 
prodigiosine. Thus, a recombinant plasmid, pET-TGATG0hiL-1_a_, 
was constructed, enabling high-level biosynthesis of 
biologically active hIL-1_a_ in E. coli BL21 (DE3) 
after induction with IPTG of the T7 phage RNA polymerase 
synthesis and subsequent transcription of artificial TGATG 
overlapping with the hIL-1_a_ gene as a distant part of it. The 
resulting recombinant hIL-1_a_ strain can be helpful in 
obtaining large quantities of cukaryotic protein for subsequent 
use in basic research and medical applications. The authors are 
grateful to F.W. Studier for supplying expression vector 
plasmids and to S.V. Kuchin and Ye.V. Velichko for discussions.

  [Abstract] The increasing popularity of the tissue culture 
method for obtaining plant cell lines with useful agricultural 
attributes and the possibility of obtaining saline resistant 
cell lines by indirect resistance selection for the toxic 
counterpart of proline to L-azetidine-2-carbonic acid as well as 
a lack of known attempts to ascertain which specific mechanism 
determines the resistance displayed by concrete cells or cell 
lines prompted a study of the likely NaCl tolerance mechanisms 
manifested by the selected cell lines. To this end, Northern 3 
Glucine max L. soybean and Trapezond Nicotiana 
tabacum L. tobacco plants were investigated. The callus 
culture was produced from the leaf mesophyll on the B5 medium. 
Selection for stability to L-azetidine-2-carbonic acid in 
soybean and tobacco culture cells made it possible to produce 
cell lines characterized by a certain set of stress factor 
protection mechanisms. It is speculated that the mechanisms of 
stability to azetidinecarboxylate are responsible for the 
selected lines' cell resistance to other limiting factors, e.g., 
salinity. The level of this resistance differs in different 
lines; moreover, the maximum stress resistance was ensured by 
joint incorporation of all proposed protection mechanisms.

  [Abstract] The popularity of immunoassay methods for 
medicinal monitoring of digoxin and reports about the presence 
of the so-called digoxin-like immunoreactive factor in the serum 
of some patients who receive no digoxin due to the 
cross-reactions with endogenic steroids as well as the desire to 
obtain monoclonal antibodies to digoxin prompted an attempt to 
produce antibodies to digoxin suitable for this drug's 
immunoassay study. To this end, digoxin was attached through the 
digitoxose terminal radical to the bovine serum albumin and 
hemocyanin; the conjugates and their properties are described. 
BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally and subcutaneously 
by 0.2 ml of emulsion. The hybridomata producing MCAs were 
produced by fusing spleen cells of BALB/c mice immunized by the 
conjugate with X-63 Ag 8.568 myeloma cells, and three hybrid 
clones were selected by indirect solid-phase enzyme immunoassay 
analysis method (ELISA). The antibodies were obtained from the 
mice's ascitic tumors, purified, and analyzed. The procedure for 
determining the antibodies' specificity and affinity is 
outlined. The findings confirm that monoclonal antibodies to the 
digoxin drug with a high affinity and specificity and with a 
binding constant ranging from 10[.sup]9[/] to 
9.2[.sup].[/]10[.sup]9[/] M[.sup]-1[/] were produced.

  [Abstract] The limitations on using immune donor 
B-lymphocytes (due to a limited range of antigens or pathogens 
allowed for human immunization) which produce antibodies of a 
given specificity--the first stage in human monoclonal antibody 
production--and known advantages of in vitro 
immunization prompted attempts to engineer a human hybridoma 
which produces antibodies to the staphylococcal anatoxin (SA) 
and examine the optimum conditions for in vitro human 
lymphocyte immunization. To this end, the blood of healthy 
donors without the specific antibodies to the staphylococcal 
anatoxin according to the rabbit blood erythrocyte hemolysis 
reaction was used. The procedure of in vitro 
immunization of human peripheral blood cells with the 
staphylococcal anatoxin was improved using lymphocytes separated 
from monocytes and cytokins, i.e., interleukin-2 products. The 
immunized human lymphocytes were subsequently used for 
constructing a heterohybridoma whereby B-enriched fraction cells 
were fused with the mice myeloma. An ELISA method was developed 
for assessing the secreted specific antibodies and an ELISPOT 
method--for determining the antibody-producing cells. The 
findings confirm the expediency of in vitro 
immunization for obtaining hybridomata which are producers of 
human MCAs to microbial antigens. The authors are grateful to 
Zh.A. Strezh and A.V. Voznyuk for biotesting of the IL-2 and 
IL-6 activity and to V.D. Zobnin for phenotype research 
assistance. Figures 1; tables 2; references 15: 3 Russian, 12

  [Abstract] The high cost of imported incomplete Freund 
adjuvant (NAF) which facilitates the development of ascite 
tumors with the best properties in mice inoculated with 
hybridoma cells--the most economical source of monoclonal 
antibodies--and the difficulty large-scale in vivo 
MCA production due to the need for large quantities of 
conditioning reagents necessitated tests of various reagents for 
conditioning the mice before inoculating them with hybridoma 
cells. To this end, 15-20 week old 18-20 g female mice 
irradiated with the help of a [.sup]137[/]Cs source were 
used. The method of hybridoma cell cultivation and the 
conditioning reagents are described. The findings demonstrate 
that with respect to all principal indicators, one of the 
compounds under study--hexadecane--can match the commonly used 
pristan. When primed with hexadecane, the proportion of mice 
with an ascite tumor, its growth duration, and the ascite 
volume, and the MCA titer were equal to, or even exceed, the 
same indicators in the pristan-primed animals examined with five 
different hybridomata. The results make it possible to recommend 
the relatively inexpensive and accessible hexadecane in place of 
pristan. Tables 2; references 10: 1 Russian, 9 Western.

  [Abstract] A solution of dry P. vitale catalase 
and 0.2 n NaOH was separated through dialysis in 0.1 n 
NH4HCO3 overnight at 8ëC. Miles 
(England) staphylococcus proteinase was added to the dialyzate, 
which was then allowed to stand for 6 h at 37ëC. The 
resulting sediment was centrifuged off, and the process liquid 
lyophilized. A total of 38 peptides were isolated through gel 
filtration on a Pharmacia (Sweden) G-50 sephadex, ion-exchange 
chromatography using Toyo-Soda (Japan) DEAE resin and Filtrak 
(Germany) FN-17 paper, and high-voltage electrophoresis using 
Filtrak (Germany) FN-17 paper. The amino-acid composition was 
determined with an AAA-339 analyzer made in the Czech Republic. 
Dansylation was used for N-end analysis. The peptides contained 
a total of 578 amino acids constituting 83% of the 
catalase's 
peptide chain, which has 670 amino acid residues according to 
x-ray crystallography data. Figures 3, tables 1; references 8: 6

  [Abstract] The effect of ionizing radiation on 
protein-lipid liposome complexes with ferrihemoglobin and 
ferricytochrome C was studied. Vesicular membranes were obtained 
by extracting phospholipids from chicken egg yolks and exposing 
the suspension to ultrasound. The ferrihemoglobin was obtained 
by oxidizing human oxyhemoglobin with potassium ferricyanide and 
then gel-filtrating it on a G-25 molselect. The ferrihemoglobin 
and the ferricytochrome C were bound to the liposomes using a 
buffer and gel-filtrated on a G-200 sephadex. Protein 
concentration was registered on a SF-46 spectrophotometer at 750 
nm. The concentration of peroxidation products was found from 
their reaction with 2-thiobarbituric acid and expressed in terms 
of MDA (malonic dialdehyde) concentration per 1 mg of membrane 
lipid. Irradiation was performed on a linear accelerator with an 
electron energy of 5 MeV at doses of 10, 50, 100, 1000, 5,000, 
and 10,000 gR. The data obtained were processed using Student's 
t-statistic and the correlation coefficient, r, on an 
Iskra-1030 computer. It was found that the irradiation reduced 
Soret band intensity, a finding that is consistent with previous 
data, and induced structural changes in the proteins. 
Calculations performed for the binding constant, binding 
locations, and change in free energy revealed that the 
irradiation induced peroxidation of the lipids in the liposomes 
and altered the structure of the ferrihemoglobin, causing 
instability in the protein-lipid interactions. It was theorized 
that the lipid component plays a key role in this instability.

  [Abstract] The urgency of the cholera problem which was 
heightened even further during the seventh pandemic outbreak 
which affected Stavropol kray and Rostov and Odessa oblasts in 
1990-91 and the attendant spread and long-term circulation of 
Vibrio cholerae in surface reservoirs prompted a 
renewed search for cholera strain identification methods. The 
difficulty of species identification with the help of available 
DNA probes because the vct genes are present in the genomes of 
far from all Vibrio cholerae strains and have a high 
homology with the Escherichia coli toxin genes 
necessitated the development of a species-specific probe and 
formulation of a new V. cholerae identification 
method on the basis of DNA molecular hybridization. The findings 
demonstrate that not only the intact 1.74 kD HindIII fragments 
but their component segments are absolutely specific and have a 
sensitivity of 10[.sup]6[/] microbial cells or 60 æg of 
purified total chromosomal DNA. The development of the 
species-specific probe makes it possible reliably and quickly to 
identify a large number of freshly separated V. 
cholerae strains and determine their epidemic hazard. This 
approach precludes an incorrect diagnosis for infections caused 
by pathogenic E. coli strains containing elt genes in 
their genome. Figures 1; tables 1; references 28: 13 Russian, 15

  [Abstract] Interest in lactobacilli and their applications 
in the food industry, medicine, and agriculture prompted a study 
of lactobacilli plasmids from the viewpoint of their development 
of properties and traits as well as their use as potential 
cloning vectors. To this end, the structural and functional 
properties of the pBS195 plasmid, including physical and genetic 
mapping, are examined, and the protein products determined by 
the pBS195 plasmid are studied. The ability of the pBS195 
plasmid to coexist with a broad range of hosts, both 
gram-positive and gram-negative, is noted, and the areas 
containing the kanamycin and oriV resistance genes are 
localized. The study reveals no homology of the kanamycin 
resistance determinants of the pBS195 plasmid with the 
determinants which control aminoglycoside of types I and II 
phosphotransferase and type II nucleotidyl transferase. It is 
speculated that in contrast to other plasmids, the pBS195 
contains a rep-system homologous with pUC19 which supports it in 
E. coli cells. Two 26 and 34 kD protein products were 
discovered by electrophoretic separation in the system of 
E. coli X295 minicells containing the pBS195 plasmid. 
The oxygenase activity determined by the pBS195 plasmid is 
discussed, and it is noted that enzyme is unusually 
substrate-specific and highly active in E. coli cells 
determined by the pBS195 plasmid. The plasmid shares homology 
with the nahC gene in the EcoRI-BamHI region. It is emphasized 
that the functional role of the oxygenase determined by the 
pBS195 for the host cells remains unclear. Figures 5; tables 3;

  [Abstract] The use of viral DNAs as vectors for in 
vitro implantation of foreign genetic codes into animal 
cells and the large number of defects in hybrid in 
vitro SV virus genome as well as the physiological activity 
of bradykinine are discussed, and an attempt is made to obtain a 
replacement vector of the SV40 virus which does not require the 
presence of a helper virus. In so doing, the gene of one of the 
proteins in the VP-1 virus envelope was fused with a synthetic 
oligonucleotide which encodes bradykinine (brd), a short 
biologically active polypeptide. In addition, the biological 
activity of the resulting vector was examined on the kidney 
culture of African green vervet monkeys (CV-1), which are 
permissive to the SV40, using immunofluorescent T-antigen 
identification, a cytopathic activity study of the recombinant, 
by testing its infectious potential, and by determining the 
physiological activity of bradykinine by the contractile action 
of new-born rat cardiomyocytes. The findings demonstrate that 
substitution of the C-terminal region of the VP-1 gene with a 
bradykinine gene sequence does not upset the principal functions 
of the VP-1 protein; the constructed SV40 (brd) vector is stable 
and serves as the basis for forming biologically active viral 
particles. The potential for using similar replacement vectors 
as producers of short active polypeptides and for studying human 
gene expressions is noted. Figures 5; references 27: 12 Russian, 
15 Western.

  [Abstract] The antibodies whose structure contains the 
molecules of two different antigen-specific segments--the 
so-called bispecific antibodies--and which are capable of 
cross-binding of molecules and cells and the methods of 
producing bispecific antibodies by fusing two hybridoma lines 
are discussed, and two approaches to fusing hybridomata 
producing monoclonal antibodies (MKA) to the _a_-tumor necrosis 
factor (FNO-_a_) and inorganic pyrophosphatase (NPF) of 
Escherichia coli are discussed. In one instance, a 
G418-stable hypoxanthine, aminopterine, thymidine (GAT) 
medium-sensitive partner was hybridized with a ``wild type'' 
partner while in another, various markers of antibiotic 
stability were introduced into both partner with the help of 
recombinant retroviral vectors. As a result, quadromata 
producing bispecific antibodies were produced by two methods 
whereby the quadromata formation efficiency was roughly the same 
in each case. The findings show that the use of retroviral 
vectors is a faster and simpler way of cell labeling. The method 
of hybridoma cell labeling with the help of retroviral vectors 
carrying dominant selectable genes of resistance to hygromycin B 
and genecytin (G418) has virtually no limitations. Figures 1; 
tables 2; references: 9 Western.

  [Abstract] The defective RNA-containing satellite virus of 
hepatitis delta (VGD) whose infectious potential is associated 
with the presence of the hepatitis B virus (VGV) in the organism 
and promising research trends directly related to the problem of 
diagnostics and study of the hepatitis delta pathogenesis 
mechanism which involves an analysis of the antigen composition 
of hepatitis B's etiological agent are discussed. The 
serological structure of the delta antigen is studied at the 
level of individual etiotopes. To this end, the effect of a 
change in the peptide chain and amino acid replacements on the 
antigen activity of the section 65-80 HDAg peptides with the 
serum from hepatitis delta patients from various CIS regions is 
examined by the enzyme immuno assay method (IFA). The findings 
reveal that 65-80 and 69-80 peptides react in the ELISA test 
with all individual preparation of anti-HDV-positive sera of 
patients with acute hepatitis delta. It is speculated that delta 
antigens contain a nonlinear antigen determinant or a set of 
highly immunogenic etiotopes between the 69th and 80th amino 
acid radicals. Thus, a special confirmation test may be 
constructed on the basis of the 65-80 synthetic peptide and its 
fragments for confirming the positive outcome of human serum 
studies obtained with the help of standard commercial ELISA 
diagnostic sets. Tables 2; references 12: 1 Russian, 11 Western.

  [Abstract] The lack of specific preventive measures against 
malleus or glanders--a dangerous infectious disease--induced by 
the Pseudomonas mallei bacteria in humans and animals 
prompted a search for the P. pseudomallei phages 
capable of transducing the P. mallei cells. To this 
end, the transduction ability of 17 P. pseudomallei 
bacteriophages five of which are capable of transducing the Tn7 
(Tp[.sup]R[/], Sm[.sup]R[/]) transposon markers to the C-5 
P. mallei strain is investigated. Together with the 
outcome of the Tr[.sup]R[/] recombinant clones, DNA-DNA 
hybridization data confirm that the PP25 phage transduces the 
P. mallei cells while the PP16, PP32, PP61, and PP64 
phages can also produce Tr[.sup]R[/] clones whose properties 
are closer to transduced C-5/PP25/Tr[.sup]R[/]Sm[.sup]R[/] 
P. mallei. The phenotypic properties of these clones 
make it possible to speculate that the PP16, PP32, PP61, and 
PP64 phages are also capable of transducing the Tr[.sup]R[/] 
and Sm[.sup]R[/] markers during transduction. The transduced 
bacterial recipients become lysogenic and acquire resistance to 
trimethoprime and stroptomycin. Figures 2; tables 2; references

  [Text] Metagonymiasis is helminthosis from the group of 
intestinal Trematoda infestation caused by the 
parasitic activity of the Metagonimus yokagawai 
Trematoda in the thin intestine of humans and a number of 
ichthyophagous animals [Katsurada, 1918]. Its etiologic agent is 
a small helminth with an elongated shape and a size of 
(1-2.5)x(0.4-0.7) mm. The purpose of this study is to examine 
the morphological pattern of the thin intestine mucous membrane 
of fish-eating animals. 
  Research material and methodology. The study was carried out 
in the Ulchskiy rayon of Khabarovsk kray with endemic 
metagonymiasis. Twelve cats were examined by the method of 
partial helminthological autopsy. The small intestine and liver 
were used for the histological study. The material fixed in a 
10% formaldehyde solution was poured into paraffin. Five 
micrometer thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and 
eosin. 
  Findings and discussion. No pathological changes were 
discovered during the histological examination of the liver. A 
moderate lymphoidal infiltration of the portal tract was 
discovered only in four out of 12 cats. A study of the empty 
intestine revealed metagonima which were positioned one by one 
or in the form of large conglomerates in the intestine 
clearance, i.e., between the villi and in the crypts (see 
figure, a-d). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-013-57A>      Figure </FIG>

  Thin feline intestine in the case of 
metagonymiasis. Magnification x100. Stained with hematoxylin and 
eosin: a--Metagonimus in the depth of the intestine crypt; 
b--Metagonimus in the intestinal clearance and freely positioned 
villi fragments; A large number of enterocytes and diffuse 
intestinal infiltration of the intrinsic villus plate; c--Two 
metagonima in the cryptal layer of the atrophic mucous membrane; 
d--Metagonima conglomeration.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The changes in the intestinal mucous membrane were mosaic in 
character. At times, the crypts were elongated, while in the 
other mucous membrane areas, they were shortened. The villi had 
different shapes and size. In addition to the usual finger- and 
leaf-shaped villi, one could also see highly shortened, 
expanded, and deformed shapes with nonuniform swelling and 
constrictions. The surface epithelium was deformed, and the 
boundaries between individual cells-- blurred; the height of the 
epitheliocytes was reduced, especially at the peaks of the villi 
where a subepithelial edema was often observed. The number of 
goblet-shaped cells was sharply decreased, and in some cases, 
they were arranged in groups (see figure, b, c). Goblet-shaped 
enterocytes were located not only near the base and in the mid 
third of the villi but also in the distal section and even at 
the tips of the villi. Interepithelial lymphocytes were often 
found among the enterocytes. In the mucous membrane plate proper 
(both in the villi and cryptal layers), considerable cellular 
infiltration was revealed (see figure, a, b, c) whereby 
neutrophile leukocytes were observed alongside lymphocytes and 
plasmocytes. 
  The above morphological changes in the small intestine's 
mucous membrane in the case of metagonymiasis should be 
interpreted as chronic diffuse-focal chronic jejunitis with 
atrophic phenomena. We should note that detection of metagonima 
is complicated in histological preparations of the small 
intestine because their dimensions and shape are very close to 
those of the intestinal villi and their fragments (see figure, 
a, b, c). It has been established [1] that the luminal surface 
of the small intestine in humans and various animals in the case 
of not only enteropathy but also under physiological conditions 
contains three agglomerations of epithelial plasty and tubular 
structures as well as braided and isolated intact villi and 
their distal fragments with rounded ends (the phenomenon of 
mucous membrane structure rejection during the lifetime). The 
free-lying oval-elongated structures also formed in the 
histological preparations due to the random character of the 
villi sections (slices). On the other hand, the metagonima 
conglomerates filled with light brown eggs (see figure g) can be 
mistaken for unwashed intestinal contents under a low microscope 
magnification. 
  Thus, metagonymiasis in fish-eating animals is a factor of 
intestinal disorder which facilitates the development of chronic 
diffuse-focal jejunitis with atrophic phenomena.

  [Abstract] When the USSR was still intact, Bashkiriya led 
the union in morbidity due to hemorrhagic fever with renal 
syndrome, with levels in some regions as high as 1000/100,000 
population. But studies have established that the percentage of 
immune populace in a region is better reflected by the activity 
of natural foci than by morbidity indices. Also important is the 
immune structure of the population, which indicates the degree 
of risk of infection among individual groups, the data for which 
cannot be obtained in morbidity analysis, because not all 
infected individuals have clinically expressed symptoms. Owing 
to that, the researchers here set out to study immune structure 
in order to screen individuals at elevated risk in the most 
active natural foci. RIA was used to study a total of 9,176 
serum samples from individuals over the age of 15. The data 
obtained was analyzed for sex, age, and occupation. The 
percentage of individuals immune to hemorrhagic fever with renal 
syndrome was greater among men than among women, but the 
difference was smaller than the difference between men and women 
diagnosed with the illness. Among the children, they found, 
there were virtually no individuals with immunity. Up to 40 
years of age, the percentage of immune individuals grows slowly, 
to 11.8 percent from 9.6. Only after 40 does it rise 
appreciably, to 16.2 percent. Individuals at higher risk are 
foresters, tractor operators, oil workers and prospectors, 
livestock breeders, drivers, and builders. References 2 (Russian)

  [Abstract] The difficulty of species-specific 
identification of mycoplasma which is important for 
understanding the infectious pathology of humans and animals and 
for detecting cell culture, vaccine preparation, and serum 
contamination prompted interest in the use of monoclonal 
antibodies (MKA) for diagnosing, separating, and identifying 
mycoplasma. The issues of obtaining hybridomata and monoclonal 
antibodies to the antigens of various types of mycoplasma and 
their uses for the microorganism diagnostics, isolation, and 
identification are addressed. In so doing, different approaches 
to fusing the cells and producing the MCA-producing hybrids are 
studied: using the sendai virus of polyethylene glycol (PEG) for 
fusing the myeloma and lymphocyte cells, fusion in a uniform 
electric field, and electroacoustic methods. As a result of the 
study, MCA-producing hybridomata for M. arginini are 
produced, and two MCA-producing clones are obtained. The 
findings confirm that production and utilization of MCAs to 
mycoplasma makes it possible to carry out species-specific 
identification and diagnostics of these microorganisms.

  [Abstract] The high incidence of leptospirosis and the harm 
it inflicts on humans and animals, both from the health and 
economic viewpoints, and the difficulty and inadequacy of 
existing identification and diagnostics methods prompted the 
development of a principally new human and animal bacteria, 
virus, and parasite identification techniques with the help of 
DNA probes. An attempt is made to establish the possibility of 
leptospirae identification and differentiation in a DNA-DNA 
hybridization reaction. To this end, reference leptospirae 
strains of 23 serological groups and commercial leptospirae 
strains used for making animal leptospirosis vaccines were 
examined. The conclusion is drawn that the use of DNA-DNA 
hybridization may substantially expand the leptospirae 
identification and differentiation test system, shorten the 
study duration, and increase the number of animals examined. The 
findings show that the use of molecular DNA cloning makes it 
possible to obtain a genus-specific DNA probe, the pLp 41, which 
is a fragment of the L. interrogans DNA of the pomoma 
serotype. The DNA probe thus engineered fuses with DNA specimens 
of many pathogenic leptospirae serotypes but does not fuse with 
any of the known saprophytic leptospira strains, thus making it 
possible to discriminate between pathogenic and saprophytic 
leptospirae. No DNA specimen hybridization signals from Y. 
pseudotuberculosis and other cells were recording for 
bacteria with the pLp 41 DNA probe, attesting to its high 
specificity. References 8: 1 Russian, 7 Western.

  [Abstract] The mechanism of ingress of Marburg virus (MV), 
strain Voege, into eukaryotic cells was deduced from studies 
involving modulation of penetration into Vero-E6 cell culture by 
the ionophore monensin and ammonium chloride (AC). Both agents, 
which act on lysosomes, inhibited replication of MV when added 
with the virus to the cell culture or used to pretreat the cells 
before exposure to the virus. Complete inhibition was obtained 
with 20-30 mM AC in a dose-dependent fashion, while monensin 
gave a maximum yield reduction (&gt;  3 log units) at a 
concentration of 5 æM. Treatment of the cells with AC 1-2 h 
after adsorption was ineffective. Furthermore, blockage by 20 mM 
AC was precluded by exposure of the virus-cell surface complex 
to pH 4.6 for 10 min to induce membrane fusion. These 
observations were interpreted to favor endocytosis as the 
mechanism by which MV enters target cells. Figures 3; references 
7: (Western).

  [Abstract] Trials on albino mice and rabbits infected with 
wild or fixed rabies viruses demonstrated that reserpine exerted 
a dose-dependent protective effect. Survival rates of 40 to 
83.4% prevailed in mice infected intramuscularly with 8-10 
LD[.sub]50[/] viral dose and treated per os or 
intramuscularly with 0.01 or 0.05 mg/kg/day of reserpine (24 h 
before infection and for 1-2 days thereafter, or 30-60 min after 
infection and for 3-4 days thereafter). Analogous studies on 
rabbits yielded 100% survival vs. 33.3% for 
placebo controls. 
Reserpine treatment was also seen to prolong the incubation 
period two-fold. These observations indicate that reserpine may 
be a promising agent for use in combined therapy of rabies in 
conjunction with vaccines. Tables 2; references 10: 8 Russian, 2

  [Abstract] The ongoing intensification of agricultural 
production led to an increase in the scale and range of 
agricultural chemicals, yet both the composition and 
capabilities of the existing assortment of chemicals do not 
fully meet today's environmental and sanitary-hygienic 
requirements. This increases the urgency of monitoring and 
studying the traces of pesticides in the environment. Thus, the 
degradation dynamics of pesticides with a varying phytosanitary 
actions in the soil and cereal plants in Kemerovo oblast's 
forest-plain zone are examined against the natural backdrop of 
soil fertility and against the optimum background of the plants' 
mineral nutrition. To this end, a cereal crop rotation study was 
carried out at the pilot test field of the Niva Kuzbassa 
scientific production association whereby the detoxication 
dynamics of three classes of pesticides--a fungicide, an 
insecticide, and a herbicide--were studied jointly and 
individually against the natural fertility background and 
against the backdrop of mineral fertilizers (N:P:K=60:60:60 
kg/ha). Toxicology analysis samples were taken on the treatment 
day and one, two, four, and six weeks later. The study reveals 
that the use of natural zeolites which have a pronounced 
adsorbing and prolonging property for a number of pesticides is 
a promising trend toward lowering their persistence in the soil 
without changing their biological activity. The use of 
pesticides with natural zeolites lowers the metaphos 
accumulation in the plants by 20%, speeds up its 
detoxication 
by two weeks, and reduces its penetration into the subsoil. The 
findings confirm the need to establish an efficient combination 
of chemical agents for various purposes and the possibility of 
controlling the process of pesticide degradation in order to 
enhance the chemicals' environmental safety. Figures 3; tables 
1; references 10.

  [Abstract] The keynote address to the 19th International 
Congress of the International Danube Limnology Association (MAD) 
held in Kiev on 15-21 Sep. 91 is reviewed. Ten reports submitted 
to the ``Radiology'' section, seven of which are directly 
related to studying the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear 
power plant accident and the other three are dealing with the 
radionuclide migration between the aqueous medium and bottom 
sediments, geological and hydrogeological structures of the 
earth surface and its vegetation, the effect of radiation on 
humans, etc., are summarized. In particular, the process of 
radioactive cloud formation due to the release of short- and 
long-lived radionuclides from the depressurized reactor is 
tentatively divided into four phases. All reports by scientists 
from four Danube nations presented to the section address the 
water ecosystem conditions of the Danube basin; emphasis is 
placed on the radioecological conditions which have formed in 
the basin of the largest European river contaminated by the 
Chernobyl catastrophe. The daily radioactive substance discharge 
into the atmosphere in the first days after the accident, the 
radionuclide composition of these discharges, the cesium and 
strontium accumulation coefficients in some ecosystem 
components, and the [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]137[/]Cs 
concentration in the Danube water are summarized, and the 
radioactive fallout pattern during the early days after the 
accident is plotted. It is noted that despite its scope, the 
review is not intended to address all aspects of the problem of 
radionuclide spread through the Danube and Dnepr ecosystem and 
is merely aimed at presenting the principal findings and 
conclusions. Figures 1; tables 4; references 13: 2 Russian, 11

  [Abstract] The unique ability of the northern Black Sea 
river vegetation to serve as amelioration plants in a region 
which otherwise has very limited natural vegetation resources 
due to the macrophytes' ability to accumulate chemical compounds 
and elements, particularly heavy metals entering the river 
basins with waste water, prompted an attempt to characterize the 
distribution of heavy metals accumulated by the Phragmites 
australis reed which covers 30-70% of the undisturbed 
territories of the rivers' floodplain and littoral landscape. To 
this end, samples were taken at 1 km intervals during a study of 
the compact Ph. australis proliferation area on the 
Danube, Dnepr, Dnestr, and Don rivers and at 5 km interval in 
the Kuban region. The findings were extrapolated, the heavy 
metal concentration was quantified, and charts were plotted 
using an SM-4 computer. The heavy metal (Pb, Mo, Cu, Zn, Ni, and 
Mn) distribution in various river estuaries near the northern 
coast of the Black sea is plotted, and the total Ph. 
australis area and primary production in the estuaries and 
gross heavy metal accumulation in estuarine Ph. 
australis are summarized. It is noted that the ever-growing 
exposure of the river basin ecosystem to man-caused factors 
increases the urgency of such studies in the future. Figures 6; 
tables 2; references 16: 14 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] The lack of published studies where mollusks--as 
pollution indicators--are treated without regard to other 
aquatic life forms, and their unique ability to filter off 
organic contaminants as well as the stringent requirements the 
mollusks impose on the water quality prompted the use of the 
mollusk presence in aquatic biocenoses as the principal 
indicator of water purity. In a toxic medium, mollusks do not 
feed and close up, while when they pass all water through 
themselves, mollusks, especially such bivalves as the 9-11 cm 
long Colletopterum piscinale and 25-27 cm long 
C. cyreum sogdianum, are capable of filtering up to 
60-70 and 180-200 l per day, respectively, and stopping all 
suspended particles. The incidence of 63 species of Gastropoda 
and Bivalvia indicator mollusks in various types of Central 
Asian reservoirs and streams is summarized. The mollusk 
distribution by the water body type as a pollution indicator in 
Central Asia is a first of its kind in scientific literature. In 
all, 56 out of the 63 species are recommended for the first time 
as bioindicators. The findings show that out of the total of 63 
species, 15 inhabit only catarobic and oligosaprobic bodies of 
water and are excellent water purity indicators, 15 are good 
indicators only of oligosaprobic slightly contaminated water, 16 
are indicators of only beta-mesosaprobic mildly contaminated 
water, and two species inhabit only alpha-mesosaprobic 
moderately contaminated water. Tables 1; references 23: 16

  [Abstract] In recent decades, a new ecological factor has 
affected the environment -- industrial gas-dust pollution. The 
environment of the Far North is extremely sensitive and is 
easily damaged during development. The researchers here used 
microbiological techniques in 1988-1991 to study the effect 
produced on micromycetes by industrial releases of pollutants 
such as SO[.sub]2[/], Ni, Cu, and Co, which accumulate in the 
surface layer of soil near the Severonikel Nonferrous Metallurgy 
Combine near Monchegorsk, on the Kola Peninsula, in the subzone 
of the northern taiga. Illuvial-humus podzolic soils were the 
targets of the study, and research plots were selected on the 
basis of the prevailing winds of the region. Soil samples were 
taken at distances of 3 km, 15 km, 30 km and 75 km from the 
combine. The data obtained by the researchers support the 
conclusions of G. A. Yevdokimova et al. (``Biological Activity 
of Soils Exposed to Agrotechnical Pollution in the Far North,'' 
Leningrad, Nauka, 1984, 120 pp.). The population of micromycetes 
in the soil near the combine was one-fourth that of the control 
region (75 km from the combine. Not surprisingly, heavy metal 
content in the soil grew as the researchers neared the combine. 
Several micromycetes -- Paecilomyces farinosus, Penicillum 
notatus, and Aspergillus niger -- accumulate 
copper and nickel, affixing them to their biomass, thereby 
preventing the development of soil toxicosis. References 25: 21

Kazakhstani Republic Academy of Sciences; UDC 591.553-577.34] 
  [Text] A review of the radioecological conditions in the 
republic is presented. The problem of animal radio-ecology is 
considered by studying the organisms and animals from the zone 
adjacent to the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site. 
  For several decades, the world community has been interested 
in the effect of ionizing radiation on the animal world. Yet 
interest in this problem has heightened relatively recently, and 
this was largely due to the tragic Chernobyl events as well as 
the growing roar of the newly declassified data on the 
radionuclide contamination of vast territories in the former 
union. 
  The natural peculiarities of Kazakhstan, its mountainous 
landscapes, and numerous deposits of diverse ores, including 
radioactive and, of course, the nuclear tests which were 
conducted for many years necessitate large- scale 
radio-ecological research. Today, there is every reason to 
regard the radiological conditions in the republic's environment 
as troubling. This can be confirmed by the data of the brief 
review of this issue compiled predominantly on the basis of 
current newspaper materials presented on the pages which follow. 
Unfortunately, our scientific publications virtually ignore 
these issues. A similar situation also existed until recently in 
the former USSR. As Zh. Medvedev noticed in Energiya 
No. 4, 1991, not a single article appeared about the Chernobyl 
catastrophe in academic journals, even in 
Radiobiologiya. The map of the nuclear installations 
in the former union was published in the first issue of the New 
York Times of 19-25 Mar 91. The map of nuclear bursts in the 
republic long promised by the State Committee on the Environment 
(Ogni Alatau, 25 Sep 91) has not yet been published. 
  Radiation Situation in Kazakhstan 
  Numerous current affairs publications dealing with the 
nuclear bursts carried out at the test site near Semipalatinsk 
between 1949 and 1989 have been accumulated in recent years. The 
so-called ``nuclear shield of the country'' is now known to 
virtually every citizen of the republic and the former union. 
Nevertheless, we should focus attention once again on some of 
the data. According to Vechernyaya Alma-Ata of 11 Feb 
92, 1,800,000 ha of land were allocated in the Semipalatinsk 
oblast for underground and surface nuclear bursts. The 
radionuclide fission product fallout pattern stretches across 
numerous inhabited localities and reaches Russia's Altay kray. 
Given a natural radioactive background of 15-18 æR/h, the 
maximum total dose on open terrain reached 200 R/h. The 
territories of the adjacent rayon have been contaminated with 
fission products dozens of times. A.D. Sakharov said that ``the 
fallout pattern is one of the principal causes of death, 
illness, and genetic damage among humans.'' Yet even Chernobyl 
left its fallout pattern in Kazakhstan territory. China is also 
making a weighty ``contribution'' to contaminating Kazakhstani 
soil. The most recent nuclear burst carried out there on 21 May 
92 reached 1-2 Mt which exceeds the yield of U.S. and Russian 
nuclear bursts by severalfold (Izvestiya, 27 May 92). 
  During the period of underground testing, approximately 100 
Ci/km[.sup]2[/] of [.sup]239[/]Pu, strontium, cesium, and [.sup]14[/] 

C and other long-lived isotopes entered the 
environment (Kazakhstanskaya pravda, 4 Jan 92). 
During 1961-1969 alone, approximately 38,000 Ci of radioactive 
strontium and almost 50,000 Ci of cesium entered the Irtysh 
water and were spread around. As years went by, the soil, 
vegetation, and water contamination continued to increase. 
Underground bursts result in the development of camouflets from 
which radioactive gases seep out and radioactive fragments enter 
the groundwater. We should keep in mind that for humans, even 
one fifty-millionth fraction of a Curie is a life-threatening 
dose. Little is still known about the actual level of 
environmental contamination from these bursts. In order to paint 
a realistic picture of contamination, one should take 
measurements at least every 20 m because of its ``spotty'' 
pattern throughout. 
  In 1964, a nuclear device was set off in the bed of the 
shallow Chagan River near the test site which formed a huge 
crater from which roughly 3.5 million m[.sup]3[/] of ground 
and ash was ejected, as a result of which a ``nuclear lake'' was 
formed. Radioactive dust covered an enormous territory with 
villages, sheep farms, and pastures. In place of snow, black ash 
covered a territory with an 80-km radius (Izvestiya, 
22 Jul 91). Out of the 300 people who were working on the lake 
at the time, less than 30 survived. The dosage rate on terrain 
reaches 50,000 æR/h in the areas of traditional cattle 
grazing 
and watering. Remote breeding and grazing fields were also 
contaminated. The concentration of various radionuclides in the 
milk and meat of agricultural animals exceeds the maximum 
permissible concentrations (PDK) by hundreds of times according 
to the report of an interdepartmental commission of the USSR 
Ministry of Public Health of 17-19 Jul 89. In 1953, a 
thermonuclear bomb with a 500-kt yield was tested at the test 
site. The external irradiation dose was enormous (50-60 R/h). 
Moreover, plutonium isotopes which are a source of alpha 
particles which are extremely dangerous when ingested into the 
organism were accumulated in huge quantities. If they enter sex 
cells, they may lead to birth defects in future generations. 
  Despite the fact that more than 40 years have passed since 
the start of the early tests at the Semipalatinsk test site, the 
radiation level at the burst sites remains very high--up to 
10,000 æR/h (Gorizont, 2 Nov 91). Approximately 1 
million ha of test site lands was returned to circulation in the 
national economy as suitable for habitation and production of 
agricultural crops. Yet serious doubts arose in the cleanness of 
these territories since one cannot rule out the presence of 
radioactive fragments containing uranium and plutonium in these 
territories which cannot be detected by existing radiation 
monitors (Ekspress K, 7 May 92). Nevertheless, 
animals are still grazing and hay is still being prepared in the 
areas with a known high radioactivity level even today. 
  Calculations show that on a global scale, the total number 
of 
victims from the nuclear tests carried out in the world has 
reached 1 million and is growing by 200,000-300,000 persons 
annually (Poisk No. 5, 1991). In his monograph 
``Uranium and Life in the History of the Earth'' (Uran i zhizn v 
istorii Zemli), S. Neruchev wrote in 1982 that three periods of 
increasing uranium accumulation intensity can be identified in 
the history of man-caused activity in the world. When these are 
compared to the history of mankind, one can note extended 
slowdowns in the development of civilization which coincided 
with the start of these periods and were accompanied by a 
decline in culture. In the author's opinion, the anthropological 
type of the people changed during the radioactivity periods! So 
what will Chernobyl, Semipalatinsk, Southern Urals, Novaya 
Zemlya, etc. bring to mankind? 
  In the ``earth-plant-animals-human'' ecological chain, soil 
is the principal link of radioactive contamination. Furthermore, 
the most biologically dangerous radionuclide of artificial 
origin (especially [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]137[/]Cs) are 
even multiplying in Kazakhstani soils. This is the opinion of 
the expert from the Kazakhstani Hydrometeorological Service 
(Ekspress K, 28 Nov. 91). They began a careful 
investigation of the soil in the republic. By the way, we still 
do not have the maximum permissible concentrations for 
radioactive contamination of the soil. Russia's Law of social 
Protection of Citizens extends to a radionuclide soil 
contamination at levels exceeding 1 Ci/km[.sup]2[/]. Fifteen 
such administrative territories have been identified in Russia 
(Argumenty i fakty Nos. 16-17, 1992). Yet the public 
in Belarus and Ukraine are insisting that this level be lowered. 
  As we know, the soil is saturated with living organisms. 
They 
amount to 90-99% of the zoological mass in land 
ecosystems. 
Many of these forms are highly sensitive to the effect of 
radiation and may store radionuclides [1]. It has been 
established that long-living soil invertebrates (earthworms, 
Dingoflagellata ticks, certain insect larvae, etc.) 
are prospective bioindicators of radioactive contamination [2]. 
  An examination of the Semipalatinsk oblast soils carried out 
by the above experts demonstrated the presence of man-made 
radionuclides in all selected samples (from a depth of 5-20 cm) 
in five areas under study. It turned out that [.sup]137[/]Cs 
and [.sup]90[/]Sr contamination exceeds the global background 
by 1.5-8.5 times. At the same time, surface radioactivity in 
these areas is within the natural norm. Earlier, in Sept- Oct 
1990, the Ukrainian corporation Protiy together with the 
Northern Ukrainian Geology Production Geological Association and 
the Environmental Problems Center at the Ukrainian Academy of 
Sciences completed activities in radio-ecological assessment of 
the Semipalatinsk test site soils and the affected area with a 
territory of 200,000 km[.sup]2[/] (see figure). A number of 
abnormally high radioactivity patterns related to the test site 
entities, i.e., surface burst craters, test boreholes, drifts, 
etc., where the [.sup]137[/]Cs contamination density reaches 
50-100 Ci/km[.sup]2[/] in some areas within a 5-cm soil layer 
was discovered within the test site on an area of 11,000 
km[.sup]2[/]. Thus, two independent expert studies confirm 
that the test site soils are contaminated while radioactivity 
from man-made sources is distinguished by its high ability to 
accumulate in living organisms. [.sup]90[/]Sr affects 
primarily the hematopoietic and osseous tissue while [.sup]137[/] 
Cs--soft tissues and especially the sexual sphere 
which has its impact on posterity.

  Uranium mines are other sources of radiation which 
contaminate the environment in Kazakhstan. The issue of the 
republic's uranium industry which supplied more than 40% 
of 
uranium to the former USSR became open for the first time after 
publication of V. Ponomarev's article ``Uranium Empire'' 
(Gorizont, Jan-Feb 92). Exploration of uranium 
deposits began in the republic in the 1950s. By 1985, the number 
of oblasts associated with uranium extraction reached nine. 
Radioactive waste from this production is being dumped into 
quarries, dumps, trenches, lake shores, and reservoir banks. At 
the same time, a serious ecological danger of sulfuric acid 
discharges arises since uranium recovery from molybdenum and 
phosphorus ores is realized by treating them with sulfuric acid. 
Hence the so-called acid rains. Uranium mining productions are 
periodically experiencing emergencies. As a result of such 
activities in Chimkent oblast, e.g., 2,600 open pits were formed 
and numerous cases of epizootic cattle disease were recorded. 
Moreover, this oblast did not escape nuclear tests. One such 
test was carried out in 1973. 
  Elevated terrain radioactivity may be attributed to 
radiation 
anomalies. For example, more than 100 such anomalies have been 
discovered in Ust- Kamenogorsk. In the city itself, areas with a 
gamma-radiation dose reaching 7,000 æR/h have been discovered 
(Ekspress K, 8 Jan 92). 
  It became known rather recently that the natural 
radioactivity background may vary within a broad range due to 
the radon gas escaping from the earth as a result of the uranium 
and thorium decay. According to 1990 data, up to 15,000 people 
die annually in the former USSR due to radon-caused cancer 
(Meditsinskaya gazeta, 30 Mar 90). We know from 
foreign press releases that approximately 20,000 deaths related 
to this gas are recorded annually in the United States. In 
Sweden, 4,600 buildings have been declared inhabitable as of 
1989 due to the high radioactivity resulting from the release of 
radon. In France, the radon level in a number of provinces 
exceeds the radiation level by 40 times. Radon is released from 
the rock and enters the rooms with building materials or from 
the soil on which the building stands. It largely accumulates in 
unventilated rooms. In our mountainous republic, unfortunately, 
no serious attention has been given to the radon problem. On the 
other hand, mandatory testing of all inert building materials 
was introduced recently in Kazakhstan (Ekspress K, 24 
Mar 92). 
  It has been established that an increase in the radon 
concentration in the inhaled air affects the pituitary gland and 
the adrenal gland and causes shifts in the entire organism. 
During these surges of the radon concentration, approximately 
30% of the population experienced a sense of alarm, 
heartbeat, 
hot flashes, headaches, and insomnia. Radon begins to escape 
actively from the rock when it is subjected to alternating 
compression and tension during perturbations of the geomagnetic 
field. This led to speculations that the state of human health 
is affected not as much by the magnetic storms themselves as by 
the radon released from the ground and building materials 
induced by them. Thus, the mountainous landscape in Kazakhstan 
makes its own contribution to the radiation conditions in the 
environment. 
  Finally, one more facet of the problem is associated with 
the 
radioactive waste and the so-called ``burials.'' Today, more 
than 17,000 sources of ionizing radiation have been recorded in 
the republic of which 11,000 are in Alma-Ata. A pavement area 
with a radiation level exceeding 500,000 æR/h was discovered 
in the city (Vechernyaya Alma-Ata, 10 Sep 91). There 
is no place to dispose of the dangerous soil. The only burial in 
the republic--at the Nuclear Physics Institute of the 
Kazakhstani Academy of Sciences--has been shut down. This 
prompted preparations to the development of a network of 
regional stations for burying substances emitting ionizing 
radiation (Vechernyaya Alma-Ata, 22 Apr 92). 
  Speaking about the problems of animal radio-ecology, it 
would 
make sense to emphasize that against the backdrop of a certain 
heightening in the interest in the health and social conditions 
of the persons living in the elevated radiation zone on the part 
of the public and the republican government (thus far, we have 
been talking only about the Semipalatinsk test site zone), the 
study of the animal as well as plant life has been nonexistent 
from this viewpoint. Yet it is quite obvious that no matter how 
accurate radiation monitoring is for measuring radioactivity in 
contaminated territories, the principal criteria for its 
assessment are still the biological indicators. Only the living 
organisms, their reaction, and status may impart biological 
sense in the most precise physical measurements and give an 
answer about the suitability of the environment for habitation. 
  Objectives of Radio-ecological Studies of Animals 
  Animal radio-ecology is one of the most recent branches of 
general radio-ecology. It entails a study of the effect of 
ionizing radiation from radionuclides introduced into natural 
biogeocenosis on the animal populations, their communities, and 
individual organisms [3]. To date, several animal radio-ecology 
trends have developed: 

  -  determination of the qualitative and quantitative 
radionuclide distribution in animal organisms; 
  -  a study of the changes in the structure and dynamics of 
animal 
populations and communities living under the conditions of 
elevated radiation background 
  -  and identification of the specific features and long-term 
consequences of the effect of external and internal (from 
incorporated radioactive elements) irradiation on the animal 
organism. 

  Principal attention is given by scientists to the first two 
trends, e.g., by such domestic researchers as R.M. Aleksakhin, 
A.I. Ilyenko, D.A. Krivolutskiy, V.Ye. Sokolov, et al. They 
analyzed the extensive materials published in the form of 
reviews, monographs, and collections [4, 5, 6]. These 
publications can serve as ground-breaking sources for 
formulating approaches to identifying the necessary objectives 
in studying the ecology of land vertebrates. Foreign sources are 
not replete with publications in the field of radio-ecology of 
free living organisms which is probably due to a more orderly 
radio-ecological situation there than here. 
  A study of the animal organism proper freely living in 
nature 
at a molecular, cellular, and systemic levels remains the 
weakest link in animal radioecology. The diversity of the animal 
life which includes rare and endangered species and the 
multicomponent and variable origin of the natural effects as 
well as the geographical and the climatic differences in the 
habitats impose their peculiarities on the course of metabolic 
processes and the level of various biochemical components of the 
organism. Certain difficulties for researchers are due to the 
need to capture a sufficient quantity of animals and acquire 
vast volumes of similar data for mathematical processing. 
  Prior to the events brought about by Chernobyl, the 
radiobiologists' principal efforts were aimed at the main 
mechanisms of the course of acute radiation syndrome, i.e., the 
effect of high radiation doses. Animal radio-ecology presupposes 
a study of the biological efficiency of low radiation levels 
since in areas with very high radiation doses, a study of low 
irradiation doses of low intensity under a prolonged (chronic) 
impact becomes a priority. Yet the effects of low doses are 
usually manifested to a lesser extent in contrast to high doses 
which can be easily reproduced experimentally on laboratory 
animals. The negative consequences of chronic low doses are 
accumulated little-by-little and cannot be easily recorded. 
Furthermore, as stated at the First All-Union Radiobiological 
Congress (Moscow, August 1989), we feel the insufficient 
development of accessible efficient methods of indication of the 
radiation reaction of various organisms and of the arsenal of 
biological radiation monitoring. There is very little 
theoretical and practical knowledge about the radionuclide 
distribution in vegetative and animal organisms and the specific 
features of the radionuclide contamination of the biocenoses. 
  In the past, a viewpoint about complete safety of low 
radiation doses figured prominently. Eventually, it became clear 
that the response to the effect of low doses may turn out to be 
completely unpredictable. New data on the effect of low 
radiation doses on humans and animals began appearing in 
scientific literature only recently. This was also prompted by 
the Chernobyl catastrophe. Yet it is impossible to replicate the 
Chernobyl or Semipalatinsk conditions in model experiments, so 
consequently, their genetic and biological impact is 
unpredictable. It must be examined directly in the [affected] 
areas. 
  Moreover, in ecologically troubled areas, the effect of 
radionuclides is often compounded by the chemical and physical 
factors of diverse origins. Their combination may result in a 
nonlinear ecological impact (synergism) which greatly exceeded 
the harm caused by these factors separately. The problem of 
synergism of radionuclides and chemical agents assumed a global 
scale, yet until recently, it has not been explored sufficiently. 
  It is well known that a definitive conclusion about the 
status of the animal organism's vital activity calls for a 
comprehensive interdisciplinary approach which is similar to the 
study of the human organism. Such experiments are based on an 
examination of diverse systems (circulatory, nervous, muscular, 
etc.) and structural-functional and metabolic processes at a 
subcellular, cellular, tissue, organ, and organism level using 
the methods of biochemistry, physiology, hematology, immunology, 
molecular biology, as well as environmental indicator methods 
such as morphometry and morphophysiology. 
  It has been uniformly agreed that the cell containing the 
genetic material is the decisive link in the reactions of 
multicellular biological systems to the radiation exposure. It 
is also beyond doubt that the principal targets of the low 
radiation doses are the biological membranes which regulate the 
interrelation between the cell and the environment. 
  Radiobiologists are constantly searching for the methods of 
biological indication of the effect of ionizing radiation and 
its quantitative assessments. The solution to this problem is 
considered from the viewpoint of various cytogenetic, 
biochemical, immunological, hematological, and biophysical 
criteria. The principal requirements imposed on the 
bioindicators of the radiation exposure include the dependence 
of the effect on the irradiation dose, the sensitivity and 
specificity, universality and suitability of any organism 
populations for analysis as well as the simplicity and quickness 
of the methodological approach used. Chromosomal analysis [7] is 
regarded as a routine method of quantitative assessment of the 
radiation dose (as an additional method for physical radiation 
monitoring data). The cellular pattern of the bone marrow and 
the micronuclear test [8] are often used for indicating the 
radiation effects. Determination of the lymphocyte 
subpopulations in peripheral blood [9] is regarded as promising. 
  A study of the organism of the animals which inhabit the 
contaminated territories is not limited to formulating the 
specific test systems. The interdisciplinary approach 
presupposes a search for the peculiar features and patterns in 
the process of animal adaptation to the chronic irradiation 
conditions, manifestations of the relative radiostability of the 
individuals and the species as a whole, and the possibility of 
predicting the impact of radiation exposures. The use of 
adequate control animal populations whose interspecific 
characteristics are similar and who inhabit the areas which are 
the closest with respect to the climatic and geographic 
parameters is an extremely important condition for attaining 
objectivity in analyzing the resulting data. 
  The fauna of the radiologically unfavorable Kazakhstan 
regions also calls for specifically zoological observations as 
one of the most important aspects of the biological variation 
monitoring in the populations of wild animals. Yet the vast 
areas of the Semipalatinsk zone as well as many other similarly 
unfavorable regions in the republic remain outside the sphere of 
the zoologists' inquiry. 
  Two months after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, 
the Belarussian researchers conducted observations of the 
population of small mammals and other animals. They discovered 
that the number of wolves and forest ferrets declined by 
fivefold and that of foxes and mouse-like rodents--by twofold. 
The males of field mice developed excessively hypertrophied 
testes and thyroid glands [10]. Among the birds, ducks, loons, 
snipes, and woodcocks were the most contaminated ones. Their 
principal nutrition are animal benthos, land and soil 
invertebrates living near the water, macrophytes, and pasture 
vegetation which, it turned out, accumulate radionuclides [11]. 
Between 1986 and 1988, 218 wild farmed and hunted mammals were 
examined within a 30-km zone of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant. It was established that the highest [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]134 
[/] 
Cs and [.sup]137[/]Cs concentration was in the 
organs and tissues of wild pigs and foxes which was followed in 
the decreasing order of concentration by gazelle, deer, moose, 
and wolf. In young animals, the [.sup]90[/]Sr concentration 
in the muscles was higher than that in the adults. On the 
organ-by-organ basis, the nuclide accumulation peaks in the 
liver and kidneys, the average levels are found in the lungs and 
muscles, and the minimum--in the wool. No differences between 
accumulation in the males and females was detected. The 
relationship between the type of animal nutrition and the level 
of radionuclides in the tissues was identified [12]. 
  The Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident not only prompted 
the study of the flora and fauna on the affected territories 
which is attested to by the international conference dealing 
with the biological aspects of its consequences held in 
September 1990 but also facilitated the development of urgent 
tasks in the fields of radiation genetics [13] and radiation 
immunology [14]. New trends are being developed in the area of 
radiation biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology 
associated with low doses and long-term consequences of 
radioecological disasters. 
  In a similar vein, the Radiobiology Laboratory of the 
Zoology 
Institute at the Kazakhstani Republic Academy of Sciences has 
been focusing its efforts since 1991 on the issues of studying 
the organisms and populations of animals inhabiting the natural 
zones of Kazakhstan with an elevated and natural radioactivity 
background. The efforts are being carried out using the 
populations of wild rodents which, as we know, are characterized 
by their high number, uniform distribution, and frequent 
succession of generations. For these reasons, these entities 
have been commonly accepted for solving the tasks of animal 
ecology and radioecology [15, 16], while the greatest diversity 
of radiation effects [17] is noted among the rodents of the 
mouse species. 
  Even the early data which we obtained from the rodents 
inhabiting the area adjacent to the Semipalatinsk nuclear test 
site provide new and original information and are stimulating 
interest. In the Chagan River valley where the surface 
background appears normal (13-15 æR/h), the soil 
contamination 
measured with the help of a gamma-spectrometer was higher than 
the global level and reached 3.5 Ci/km[.sup]2[/]. The forest 
mouse (39 animals) were the most common among the 70 animals 
representing eight species trapped over this territory. A study 
of this population revealed an extreme nonuniformity with 
respect to a number of morphophysiological features, e.g., a 
high variation coefficient. The animals differed most 
significantly with respect to their morphometric parameters and 
cellularity indices of the bone marrow. With respect to these 
characteristics, adult mice could be clearly divided into two 
groups. In the first group, the animals had a higher level of 
bone marrow cellularity and had a greater mass, body length, and 
tail length. All distinctions are statistically significant. At 
the same time, it was discovered that one of the most important 
parenchymatous organs, such as the liver, had an elevated 
functional activity in the individuals with higher bone marrow 
indicators which was judged by the activity of a broad range of 
enzymes used in clinical tests of its status. 
  The cytogenetic studies of the bone marrow cells of the 
animals under study made it possible clearly to record an 
elevated chromosomal aberration level. From among the 282 cells 
examined in the metaphase, 6.74% had various types of 
aberrations. Yet it is known that as a norm, the bone marrow of 
mammals contains between 0 and 2% of aberrant cells, 
depending 
on the species and age. Based on this, one can draw the 
conclusion that the significant increase in this indicator among 
the rodents who for a long time inhabited the area of the former 
nuclear tests discovered by us directly attests to the serious 
impairments in their genetic system. 
  Many of the rodents under study were characterized by a 
large 
number of erythrocytes in the blood. A leftward shift of the 
differential blood count, i.e., a predominance of young 
neutrophile forms over the mature ones, was common to all 
animals. The fact that there is a change in the red and white 
blood count under the effect of ionizing radiation is commonly 
accepted today and is regarded as one of the principal criteria 
of its biological effect [5]. In our case, the variability of 
these interesting indicators may determine the extent of 
long-ranging consequences of nuclear testing among the 
inhabitants of the affected territories and their adaptation 
reactions. Activities in the test site area are continuing. In 
addition to the specifically radio-ecological effects, an 
analysis of even the early experiments reveals noticeable 
interspecific and sex-age differences for a broad range of 
biochemical indicators which is of interest from the viewpoint 
of understanding the specific features of the rodent organism 
activity. Such a cellular-tissue approach to studying wild 
animals is promising for solving the problems of comparative 
radiosensitivity, radioadaptation, and synergism phenomena and 
as a whole--for constructing models for predicting the vital 
activity of populations under varying extreme conditions. 
  In conclusion, we should note that zoologists specializing 
in 
all areas must start studying the problems of animal 
radio-ecology of Kazakhstan in all directions of this field of 
science. There is no doubt that only a complex of large-scale 
scientific research activities may become the basis for 
successfully solving all urgent problems.

  [Abstract] Radioactive contamination of the river 
ecosystems of Europe is a growing problem that is a direct 
result of the growing nuclear power industry. The Volga basin 
has two nuclear power plants. The Dunay basin, which had 10 in 
1978, is expected to have 29 by the year 2000. The Dnepr basin 
has six such plants. The work reported here was performed in 
1988 and involved studies of the two radionuclides that are the 
most ecologically significant -- [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]137[/] 
Cs -- in the hydrobionts of the Volga, Dunay, and 
Dnepr. The researchers found the following in terms of [.sup]90[/] 
Sr levels in the Volga: algae 
(Cladophora), 0.4-9.7 Bq/kg; higher water-plants, 
0.4- 32.6 Bq/kr; mollusks, 2.3-28.1 Bq/kr; fish, 0.2-2.2 Bq/kg. 
Those figures for the Dunay were 3.9-30.1 (green filament 
algae), 0.2- 5.7, 3.5-64.0, and 1.4-2.3. For the Dnepr, they 
were 92.1-525.4 (green filament algae), 25.5-1165.5, 6.5-4144.0, 
and 5.9-120.6. Green filament algae had [.sup]137[/]Cs levels 
that were 9.3- 24.5 Bq/kg in the Volga, 8.9-69.6 in the Dunay, 
and 259.4-2479.0 in the Dnepr. Higher water-plants showed the 
following levels: 0.6- 58.5 Bq/kg (Volga), 2.6-93.6 (Dunay), and 
10.1-5920.0 (Dnepr). Volga mollusks had levels of 0.9-35.6 
Bq/kg, as opposed to 3.3-11.8 in the Dunay and 9.6-148.0 in the 
Dnepr. Fish had levels of 0.8-5.1 Bq/kg in the Volga, 10.7-17.0 
in the Dunay, and 15.5-44400.0 in the Dnepr. References 11: 7

  [Abstract] A comparative analysis of the effect of air 
pollution young pine (Pinus silvestris L.) and spruce 
(Picea obovata L.) trees of the Central Urals focused 
on releases from the primary source of pollution of the 
Revdinsk- Pervouralsk Industrial Center -- the Sreduralmedzavod, 
a copper- processing plant. The principal components of the 
pollution over the past 50 years have been compounds of sulfur, 
nitrogen, copper, arsenic, and lead. The study involved six 
sectors -- three with stands of the pine, three with stands of 
the spruce. The sectors were 4, 15, and 25 km from the plant. 
Biometric characteristics of the stands fell the closer the 
study was to the plant. The atmospheric pollution was found to 
have a greater effect on the growth processes of the spruce. 
Electrophysiological studies indicated that the conductive 
properties of the trees were reduced and that the membrane 
system for the transport of water and ions in the tree trunks 
(the site of placement of the electrodes) was poorly developed. 
Overall, the spruce appeared to be more sensitive to the 
pollution than did the pine. References 12: 9 Russian, 3 Western.

  [Abstract] Metabolic monitoring was performed on 20 
children, boys and girls 8-12 years old, in the Brest Olast 
exposed to elevated backround levels of Cs and Sr radionuclides. 
Urinary levels of Cs ranged from 20 to 400 Bq/L and of Sr from 
0.003 to 0.3 Bq/L; 18 of the children presented with euthyroid 
hyperplasia, 15 with generalized gastrointestinal disorders, and 
6 with chronic gastritis in remission. Clinical chemistries 
revelated positive, significant (p less than 0.05) correlation 
coefficients between elevated plasma levels of malonic 
dialdehyde and plasma and erythrocyte levels of lipid peroxides 
and urinary Sr and Cs concentrations. The patient cohort also 
presented with depressed erythrocyte catalase (p less than 0.05), 
superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (p less than 
0.05) 
activities. In conjunction with other factors reflecting energy 
metabolism, the findings were consistent with an interpretation 
that increased exposure to the radionuclides entailed activation 
of lipid peroxidation and compromised antioxidant mechanisms. 
Accordingly, therapeutic measures in such at-risk children 
should be directed at stimulation of tissue respiration, 
correction of acidotic shifts and control of lipid peroxidation 
to alleviate cell membrane damage. Tables 2; references 6: 5

  [Abstract] There is reason to doubt the accuracy of data on 
occupational diseases in Belarus because of the rather random 
and irregular screening programs. Available data have shown that 
years of exposure to a given factor may be required before frank 
pathology can be discerned, and then only if a system of 
regularl examinations are scheduled. The screening system in 
Belarus has to be improved to discern premorbid states well in 
advance of disease onset, which means implementing regular 
medical examinations. Once regular screenings have been 
implemented, the time of appearance of a premorbid condition may 
be regarded as a temporal exposure limit for a given risk 
factor. References 15 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Recent studies showing the important role of 
hemostatic and hemorheologic impairments in the pathogenesis of 
diabetic angiopathy and the development of purulent necrotic 
lesions in the lower extremities in diabetic patients prompted 
an examination of the efficacy of hemosorption in treating 
diabetic gangrene patients and an attempt to ascertain its role 
in correcting the hemostatic disorders of blood circulation. To 
this end, 159 diabetic patients with trophic and purulent 
necrotic foot and calf lesions were observed, and 18 male and 12 
female patients were examined. Diagnostic tests were used for 
analyzing the hemostatic system. Extracorporeal hemosorption was 
conducted together with conservative therapy which included 
carbohydrate metabolism correction by means of subcutaneous 
insulin injection and hemo- and rheocorrector treatment, 
antibacterial and immunotherapy, etc. Hemosorption facilitated 
an increase in the anticoagulant and fibrinolytic plasma 
activity and improved peripheral circulation, making it possible 
to expand indications for ``minor'' foot amputations and lower 
the number of high amputations to 13.3%. On average, the 
use of 
complex therapy with hemosorption shortened the diabetic ulcer 
preparation by 5-7 days. Figures 3; references 8: 7 Russian, 1

  [Abstract] WHO's HIV diagnostic recommendations whereby the 
incidence of infection is established using two-stage screening 
for detecting antibodies to the virus in the blood serum based 
on the outcome of an ELISA (enzyme immuno assay) test are 
discussed and it is noted that HIV have been detected in 
cultivated lymphocytes isolated from seronegative patients. This 
factor calls for direct detection of the virus components in the 
lymphocyte cultures of the patients. The findings of such 
attempts are presented. The blood of married couple S was 
examined for three years whereby enzyme immuno assay study to 
determine HIV antibodies was carried out using Antigen, Vektor, 
and Epitop commercial test systems. The study confirms the need 
for an extremely cautious approach to the false-positive results 
of serological tests, especially in the cases where antibodies 
to the p24 and p55 HIV-1 proteins are determined in the 
immunoblot assay since they indicate fresh infection. Moreover, 
the case of patient Sf from whose blood antibodies to HIV-1 
proteins disappeared with time confirms known data on the 
possibility of silent HIV infection when only the polymerase 
chain reaction and/or virus isolation are capable of correctly 
to diagnosing HIV infection. Thus, an uncertain outcome of 
serological analysis calls for a comprehensive virological and 
molecular biological study so as to avoid misidentifying 
infected persons with false-negative serological test results.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukhaya: ``AES Will Charge You Up With </F>
Health''] 
  [Text] I've got a bean-sized capsule on my palm. It has a 
microprocessor inside. This little ``bean'' is called a 
self-contained electrostimulator (AES). It's a unique 
article--you can't find anything else like it in the world--that 
came into being through the joint efforts of medical specialists 
(chiefly surgeons) and electronic specialists over a decade ago. 
But only doctors and patients of the elite clinic of the Health 
Ministry's Main Administration No. 4 knew about it. Today the 
AES is becoming available to simple mortals. 
  Electrostimulation has already been used extensively for a 
long time in different areas of medicine. But it was a long time 
before the simple of idea that the body needed to be acted upon 
by electric pulses from within came into someone's mind. It was 
this idea that was brought to life by the creators of this 
electronic pill--the AES. 
  As we know, the central nervous system generates certain 
pulses with which all organs are controlled. The moment some 
breakdown, or ``error'', occurs in this body control system, a 
particular disease arises. The task of the AES is to travel 
through the whole body (10 meters of intestines) in 25-36 hours, 
find the damaged or ``sleeping'' components, and awaken 
them--activate them and restore their operation by means of 
electric pulses. After this the capsule is eliminated from the 
body in the natural way. 
  This electronic pill was initially intended for use chiefly 
in surgery. The probability of complications--paralysis or 
paresis of the intestine--is high after any complex abdominal 
operation. Surgeons know all too well how high mortality 
following such complications is. Consequently it was no accident 
that several of our most prominent surgeons (including 
Academician Petrovskiy at the Surgical Institute and Professor 
Lukomskiy at Medical Institute No. 1) were among the first to 
actively begin using the AES in therapeutic practice. 
  Having undergone the required clinical tests in the 
country's 
leading clinics, the AES began to be used in the Fourth 
Administration's closed clinics in 1984. The cherished capsules 
were made at a certain military plant in limited quantities, 
because they are very expensive, as is true by the way of any 
complex microelectronic device. Nonetheless, over a period of 10 
years the pill was used around 2 million times to treat 
thousands of patients. Among its regular users were certain 
``ruling elite'' whose faces were seen every day on official 
documentary footage. 
  No side effects were established for the AES. And new 
miraculous properties of the magic capsule were continually 
discovered. 
  It was found that the besides having a local effect on the 
most highly damaged components (parts of the intestine, the 
liver, or duct systems), the AES has a powerful influence upon 
the entire body as a whole, in a sense enlivening some 
``sleeping'' forces in the individual. The body undergoes 
detoxification--wastes are eliminated from it. Circulation 
improves, and immunity and performance increase. In serious 
stressful situations the electronic pill relieves depression and 
fatigue, and raises vital tone. It is therefore absolutely no 
surprise that the capsules were so popular among our elderly 
government officials. 
  Prolonged use of the AES confirmed that stimulation helps to 
reveal chronic prostatitis complicated by impotency. Research 
conducted by Professor Balabolink at the Endocrinology Institute 
revealed that lipid metabolism indicators normalize in the 
presence of sugar diabetes (the non-insulin dependent form). One 
of the most important results of the work of the electronic pill 
is its positive effect upon hypertension and atherosclerosis. 
Finally, the AES proved itself to be indispensable in military 
field surgery and in emergency medicine--there are times when 
only the stimulator can revive a person from a coma or shock. 
  Let me emphasize one more time: The AES does not introduce 
anything foreign into the body, anything alien to it, because 
the pulses the pill produces already exist in the individual, 
and are generated by our nervous system. 
  Research on electrostimulation is continuing. Judging from 
everything, new surprises await us in the future. But it is 
already clear that the AES affects aging processes. There are 
serious grounds for suggesting that it can and must be used to 
prevent oncological diseases. It is becoming increasingly more 
obvious to medical specialists that the electronic pill is 
essentially needed by everyone. Nonetheless, the future of this 
miracle of micro-engineering is under great doubt. 
  As often happens in our country with any innovation, the 
electronic capsules are having a hard time making their way to 
the people. The O.K. to make wide use of the AES was obtained 
with the help of the Medical Equipment Administration of the 
Russian Ministry of Health. But the Fourth Administration--the 
chief user of the electronic pill--no longer exists. Practically 
no one in other clinics knows about it, and hospitals don't even 
have enough money for the most elementary medicines, not to 
mention microelectronics. Converted enterprises of the 
military-industrial complex have lost their former might, and 
each day new problems are faced in production of the 
electrostimulators, which is currently being conducted by the 
Ecomed Scientific-Production Association. 
  The existence of the AES has already long been known beyond 
the borders of our fatherland, and the innovation has been given 
its proper assessment. It is fully possible to sell the 
discovery there--buyers could be found right now. And no one 
would be especially amazed by such a sale--the world has already 
become accustomed to our practice of selling off our unique 
technologies and inventions generously for a pittance. However, 
today's creators of the electronic pill, who invested many years 
of their lives into it and who are deeply convinced that this is 
to be the medicine of the 21st century, stubbornly want to save 
their invention for Russian fellow citizens. Such are the 
strange people who are caring for this fabulous electronic bean.

the Kazan Rpublican Center for Emergency Medicine and the 
medical corps of the local garrison in catastrophic situations. 
Emphasis is placed on the need for preparedness, pre-planning, 
and delineation of duties and responsibilities of the different 
components of the system. Only then can the avaible human and 
material resources be utilized to the fullest for saving lifes, 
providing adequate medical care, and preserving an acceptable 
level of public health services. Without such planning a 
coordinated, timely and rational response is virtually 
impossible.

  [Abstract] Inflation, price increases, unemployment, 
declining purchasing power of the population and unsatisfactory 
food supply are creating a real threat of mass scale vitamin 
deficiency, especially during the winter and spring time. In 
June of 1992 employees of the Vitamin and Mineral Substances 
Metabolism Laboratory of the Nutrition Institute, RAMN, in 
cooperation with public health workers of the Republic of 
Bashkortostan had studied vitamin consumption by various groups 
of Republic's population, in order to develop practical 
recommendations on optimizing the vitamin status of the 
population. The objects of studies were 169 industrial workers, 
109 blood donors, 111 pregnant women and 40 children, 7 to 16 
years old. The study results indicate extremely low consumption 
of vitamin C by Bashkortostan population. Consumption of vitamin 
A was fairly good. Carotene consumption was unsatisfactory. 
Everybody in the study had a normal average level of vitamin A. 
Consumption of vitamins B[.sub]1[/], B[.sub]2[/] and 
B[.sub]6[/] was extremely unsatisfactory. There was moderate 
to deep deficiency of vitamin B[.sub]12[/]. On the whole the 
obtained data indicate extremely unsatisfactory consumption of 
all studied vitamins with the exception of vitamins A and E. The 
article characterizes the vitamin deficiency in the majority of 
study participants as polyhypovitaminosis. Only 3.5% of 
the 
population have sufficient amount of vitamins, while 15% 
have 
vitamin deficiency in terms of at least one vitamin. Tables 4,

  [Abstract] The Novosibirsk Oblast Fund for Compulsory 
Medical Insurance was created on August 15, 1992, in response to 
national and regional legislative measures intended to provide 
compulsory medical insurance in the Russian Federation. The 
system has been created to ensure that for-profit and nonprofit 
employees make health insurance deposits in the fund equivalent 
to 11.8% of wages. Contributions for farmers have been 
set at 
3% of earnings and for the otherwise self-employed at 
8%. In 
adddition, supportive voluntary contributions to the fund from 
various other domestic and foreign sources are encouraged. A 
governing board of 22 members has been established to administer 
the fund. Until all of the administrative and organizational 
components are in place and functioning, licenses for temporary 
administration of the insurance program have been granted to 
selected insurance companies as an interim solution. Figures 1.

  [Abstract] 
A survey of cancer statistics for the 1980-1990 decade in 
Western Siberia has shown an overall pattern of increase in 
morbidity and mortality, consonant with the pattern of the rest 
of the Russian Federation. The changes affected both the urban 
and--especially--the rural areas of the 5 regions under 
consideration: Altay Kray and the Kemerovo, Novosibirsk, Tomsk 
and Omsk oblasts. Considerable variation was evident among the 
territories, with the maximum increase (24.2%) seen in the 
Tomsk Oblast and the smallest increment (6.0%) in Kemerovo 
Oblast. In general, the incidence of gastric and uterine cancers 
diminished during the decade, but lung, breast and hematopoietic 
malignancies and resultant deaths were on the increase. These 
changes in cancer epidemiology signal that the pattern in 
Western Siberia is beginning to approximate that evident in the 
Russian Federation as a whole. In addition to industrial 
pollution and other anthropogenic factors, global etiologic 
factors must also be considered in assessing the changing 
patterns evident in Siberian cancer epidemiology. Tables 1;

<F P=106> [Article by A. Demin, Consultant to the Russian Federation </F>
President Service; `Kalmykia Phenomenon Awaiting Analysis' under 
the rubric of ``For the health-conscious''] 
  [Text] The mortality of children under the age of one 
(infant mortality--MS) is conventionally treated as one of the 
principal integral indicators of the population health and 
survival status. In its democratic policy, the Russian 
Federation should treat it as a high priority item and attempt 
to decrease infant mortality, preserve the life and health of 
low- birth-weight and premature babies, and decrease the 
frequency of abortions. 
  We just received State Statistical Committee data showing 
that during the first six months of 1993, 14,690 infants died in 
the Russian Federation vs. 15,491 infants during the same period 
of 1992. Yet adjusted for 1,000 births, the infant mortality 
index amounted to 19.1 and 17.7, respectively (1993 as a 
percentage of the same period of 1992, i.e., 107.9%). 
Thus, the 
average figures for Russia reveal a certain deterioration in the 
situation in this field. 
  Yet the experts foresaw such an increase of these very sad 
indicators since one should keep in mind the effect of the 
implementation of the new concept of live and still birth in 
Russian practices according to the World Health Organization 
(VOZ) criteria. According to preliminary expert estimates, it 
may lead to a 20% increase in the infant mortality level 
by 
improving the comparability of the Russian Federation and 
foreign indicators. In the developed European countries, the 
United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan, the infant 
mortality rate is 5-9 per 1,000 live births. 
  There is one more issue which should be taken into account 
in 
analyzing the State Statistical Committee data: considerable 
discrepancies between the country's territories with respect to 
most health indicators, including the infant mortality level. 
  These distinctions were also maintained during January-June 
1993 (map 1). The lowest levels are noted in Khalmg-Tangch in 
the republic of Kalmykia and the highest--in the Chukchi 
autonomous district, the republic of Tuva, Jewish autonomous 
district, Chechen and Ingush republics, and the republic of 
Altay. A level of 23 or more cases per 1,000 births was also 
recorded in Krasnoyarsk kray and Kurgan, Irkutsk, and Ulyanovsk 
oblasts. 
  Map 1 [not reproduced]: Infant mortality in Russian 
Federation republics, krays, and oblasts in January-June 1993 
(cases per 1,000 births). 10.8 in republic of Kalmykia, 30.6 in 
Chukchi autonomous district, 16.2 in Moscow, 18.7 in St. 
Petersburg, and 29.4 in Jewish autonomous district. 
  It is also important to assess the infant mortality trends 
territory by territory. The most significant infant mortality 
decrease was noted in the republic of Kalmykia (60%). The 
proportion of decrease is so high that the Kalmykia phenomenon 
certainly calls for a thorough analysis. A considerable drop was 
also observed in Murmansk, Penza, and Kaluga oblasts. Yet in 
many territories, infant mortality rose. The developing 
situation in the Astrakhan, Ivanovo, and Orel oblasts, St. 
Petersburg, Kurgan, and Lipetsk oblasts, Kabardino-Balkar 
republic, and Ryazan oblast causes special alarm. 
  In analyzing the causes of the infant mortality pattern in 
Russia as a whole, one can note an increase in the mortality 
indicator during January- June 1993 relative to the same period 
in 1992 for the principal causes, most of which include the 
following: accidents, poisoning, and trauma (125%), 
digestive 
tract diseases (123.1%), and infectious and parasitic 
diseases 
(113.1%). 
  The noted increase in the infant mortality indices is seen 
against the backdrop of falling birth rates where mortality 
rates exceeds birth rates over most of the Russian territory and 
in Russia on average. Due to the aforesaid peculiarities, it 
would be expedient to analyze and assess the reasons for the 
increase in mortality, primarily in the most affected 
territories, in order to take immediate necessary and 
coordinated measures at federal and local levels. Of course, the 
experience of territories at which a decrease in infant 
mortality coupled with low levels of this indicator is noted is 
especially valuable. 
  Yet a coordinated effort is also necessary for the 
territories where a high level of infant mortality and an 
increase in the infant mortality indicator was noted in 
January-June of this year. The worst among these are the Chukchi 
and Jewish autonomous districts and Kurgan and Irkutsk oblasts.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Lyapustin, `Ripping Off Patients: Hundreds of </F>
Millions of Rubles Embezzled by ... Public Health Officials in 
Chelyabinsk'] 
  [Text] All theft is amoral, but I have never seen a theft 
more amoral than the one that occurred in Chelyabinsk: the needy 
were ripped off--patients at Chelyabinsk clinics. 
  The budget (federal, regional, and city-wide) is bursting at 
the seams--money is short for everything: subsidies to the poor, 
welfare... Salaries to scientists and teachers, library workers, 
and other persons on the budget have been delayed. No one knows 
how to cover the shortfall of funds for new remuneration and 
deferred pensions and wages. Yet the situation in which our 
public health has found itself is an outright failure. 
  We still have a long way to go to support medicine while 
budget allocations are being cut, drug prices are going through 
the roof, drug purchases from abroad are declining, and the 
health of the population is becoming increasingly dependent on 
the favor of the ``sponsors.'' Sometimes the hospitals are short 
of bandaging materials, and the physicians are sometimes walking 
the picket lines and sometimes--almost striking due to low wages. 
  The answer is still the same: no money! 
  Yet at the same time... the staff of the Department of 
Prevention of Economic Crimes apprehended a group of embezzlers 
who put their hand in the till which holds the meager 
Chelyabinsk public health resources. No, it was not the 
professional robbers who cracked the safe--it was the staff of 
the medical affairs committee who ``helped themselves'' to the 
alms of mercy... Those whose job description called for pinching 
every penny. 
  The first among the apprehended were the bookkeeper of the 
city public health committee, a procurement official from the 
same committee, and an employee of the disinfection station. 
  They appropriated the budget allocations for medical 
development and drug purchases while the chief accountant and 
his team were pampering themselves rather than meeting hospital 
demands. Resources from the City Public Health Department 
account were transferred to commercial structures. But not for 
drugs. The criminal team acquired... gold jewelry and valuables! 
How much? The investigation will eventually find the final 
figures but an astronomical amount is already becoming 
clear--400 million rubles. 
  The money also went to the stores where the clearing 
accounts 
were turned into sets of furniture, TV and video equipment, 
refrigerators, and fur coats. And to write off the funds and 
appropriate everything was simply a matter of skill. 
  No sooner than the citizens of Chelyabinsk recovered from 
the 
shock caused by the publication of a report about this crime in 
Vecherniy Chelyabinsk, a new report appeared in the 
press: the chief accountant of the Chelyabinsk city sanitary 
epidemiologist station was detained at the Sheremetyevo Airport. 
She was trying to flee after pocketing, in the words of the 
newspaper, 70 million rubles. When arrested at the airport, she 
also was found to have foreign currency. Yet the city police are 
not yet confirming the amount but they are not denying it 
either--the investigation will reveal the ``bottom line.'' 
  Yet sensations did not end here. The procurement official 
from the medical committee turned himself in to the police 
without awaiting arrest. The chauffeur of the medical committee 
chairman was also detained. Valuables, cars, and ``luxury 
items'' were confiscated. Thus far, they are talking about a 
theft of half a billion rubles. Thus far... This is because the 
chief physician of the Student Clinic No. 2 at the Technical 
University has also been detained. Who is next? 
  Such are the figures and facts, but they are not final. The 
total amounts stolen will be clarified, someone will be 
released, and someone, on the contrary, will have the jail cell 
door slammed. The investigation continues, and the final 
conclusions still lie ahead. Why did the usually reticent 
investigators have the preliminary information made so promptly 
available to the local press? 
  Is it because that they are afraid that someone is 
``behind'' 
all this? Especially since Chelyabinsk residents have more than 
just suspicions about it--the husband of one of the suspects 
(defendant) turned out to be the chief of the tax police. Here 
is another confirmation--the investigator, Lieutenant Colonel R. 
Podvigina, was ``warned.'' After coming back home, Raisa 
Mikhaylovna found the apartment door open and things out of 
order in the rooms, yet nothing was taken. Just a hint... 
  Publications on the case of the budget millions appeared 
during the finishing line of the recent elections. We know that 
the oblast administration has committed a number of gaffes. Once 
they gave a ``present'' of several million to a dealer for 
buying American clothes but found the merchant in the 
Krasnoyarsk interrogation lockup and, of course, without the 
money. Another time, they ``allocated'' 200 million for sugar, 
and as far as we know, have not received the goods yet. 
  The scandal at the ``curtain call'' of the election campaign 
helped the opponents of the democrats to secure such a 
high%age 
of votes in Southern Urals. 
  Yet it is not up to me to decide whether it was necessary to 
catch up to the chief accountant of the sanitary and 
epidemiological station at Sheremetyevo due to the premature 
publication of the case. And why did the warehouse with the 
scarcest drugs costing tens of millions of rubles burned during 
the same period? 
  The interrogation will see it more clearly and sort things 
out. We will wait until its end and will promise to tell the 
Trud readers about its outcome.

<F P=106> [Article by Ye. Vasilkova, `Do Not Get Sick! How Many </F>
Healthy Ones Left?'] 
  [Text] The birth rate in Russia has dropped from 17 to 12 
per thousand residents while mortality rose from 10.5 to 11.4. 
More than 40% of children are born with various defects. 
Significant health deficiencies are found in 75% of 
schoolchildren. 
  In Russia, three million people don't show up for work every 
day due to illness while 20-25 million are in pre- or 
post-illness state. More than 70% of the able-bodied 
population 
is suffering from various disease by the time they reach pension 
age, and this is despite the fact that here people retire 5-10 
years earlier than abroad. The life expectancy of our citizens 
is 10-14 years shorter than in the United States, England, 
France, Germany... 
  Only 20% of the Russian population is healthy. 
  Professor A. Razumov, director general of the Moscow Health 
Problems Center at the Moscow City Government, cited these 
disturbing statistics at the founding meeting of the Russian 
section of the International Academy of Sciences. And he 
explained the principal reason for such an alarming outcome: our 
public health system has always focused on the disease and the 
patient. And they should have preserved the health of the 
healthy. It is still not too late to arrest this troubling 
national degeneration trend, but this calls for urgently 
changing the old concept and developing a new direction of 
medical and social prevention and health protection. 
  Henceforth, this will be the responsibility of the 
International Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine. 
Representatives from our and foreign medical establishments and 
the parliamentary deputies as well as the Russian Federation 
Minister of Public Health participated in the founding meeting. 
  In the words of the Public Health Minister E. Nechayev, ``it 
is hard to imagine that one institute will be able to solve all 
problems which took decades to accumulate; regional branches of 
the institute will be necessary.'' Recently, we encountered the 
following problem: not a single medical expert could answer the 
question of how many healthy people were living in their 
district. Yet they could name without hesitation the number of 
patients with ulcer, cardiac disease, diabetis... So much for 
our psychology. 
  Yet we have been involved in prevention for a long time. 
Back 
in 1847, the book entitled ``Occupational Diseases and Their 
Prevention'' was published in Russia. And after the revolution, 
the outpatient institute was even set up in 1923. 
  Well, one will have to hope that the new institute will help 
all of us to reevaluate ourselves and treat our health as the 
most precious gift.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Kudryavtseva, `Come to Us for Cure'] </F>
  [Text] Only few could come to the elite clinic at the Third 
Chief Directorate of the Russian Federation Ministry of Public 
Health until recently, while today, it opens its doors to all. 
  There are 58 physicians and 120 medical workers, many of 
whom 
are experts with scientific degrees of the highest and first 
skill categories who are ready to provide almost any type of 
medical assistance. Patients are seen daily by 25 specialists, 
while the clinic has a total of 10 departments and services. 
  This includes surgery, ophthalmology, ear, nose, and throat 
diseases, and dermatology and STD departments. Here, one cannot 
only have a tooth treated but also solve the problems of 
dentures. Psychotherapists, neuropathologists, and immunology, 
urology, and OB-GYN experts also work there. The clinic can also 
treat allergies and infectious diseases. Yet the most important 
in the clinic are the therapists. 
  The clinic is providing medical services to more than 60 
industrial enterprises in the city. Skilled experts thoroughly 
examine the production and health status conditions of the 
workers from the enterprises and provide authoritative 
recommendations. And if, e.g., it is contraindicated to John Doe 
to work next to a vibration machine, the doctor would recommend 
that he be transferred to another department. The ten-year 
experience of such cooperation yielded its results. Statistics 
show that the total morbidity at these enterprises declined by 
30%. No one knows how much money has been saved, but most 
importantly, the health of the people which, everyone knows, 
cannot be measured by money, has been preserved! 
  The wise students of Hippocrates used to say: ``bene 
diagnostus, bene curatio'' which means--he who diagnoses 
well, cures well. In today's setting, one can say that without 
modern equipment, accurate diagnostics are impossible, and 
consequently, one should not expect correct treatment. In the 
words of the chief physician, Candidate of Medical Sciences Oleg 
Kuzovlev, the clinic has accumulated the best equipment which, 
in addition, is annually updated. Here, one can find medical 
devices manufactured in Japan, FRG, Sweden, and the United 
States. And all of these are unique in their own right. For 
example, the Japanese ultrasonic devices made by the Aloka 
Company make it possible to detect cancer, a cyst, tumor, or 
heart disease with 100% certainty. Using the Japanese 
Olympus 
gastroscopes, one can treat stomach and intestinal polyps and 
ulcers, while the bronchoscopes made by the same company cure 
chronic bronchitis and pneumonia. 
  If you have a problem with your eyesight, you have a fundus 
camera at your disposal which can detect the earliest symptoms 
of the retina disease. A laser scalpel is also used in the 
clinic. 
  It turns out that one cannot only study the vital activity 
of 
the organs, but also to peek inside the human and microbe cells. 
Instruments for this purpose exist in the biochemistry lab. 
Biochemical and other analyzers provide 100% confidence of 
research outcome. For example, the vital activity of tissues and 
cells is determined by more than 80 different indicators. 
  The anatomy and physiology of the brain have become 
completely accessible for research due to the 16-channel 
electroencephalograph. One can also determine the blood flow 
rate in the brain vessels. The intercranial Doppler instruments 
make it possible to do so with high accuracy. 
  Much attention is given at the clinic to diagnostics. Here, 
functional, computer, and endoscopic diagnostics facilities are 
at work and, of course, traditional X-ray machines. Studies are 
underway at the biochemistry, bacteriological, virology, 
immunology, and even serology laboratories. 
  There are 24 biologically active spots on the human body 
which, in a way, represent all internal organs on the skin 
surface. Literally within minutes, a computer monitoring these 
spots can determine which organs function properly and which are 
strained, and thus observe the functional status of the organism. 
  In the clinic, the patient passes through a ``conveyor'' of 
medical experts who determine the accurate diagnosis. Here, they 
will not only find out what hurts and will prescribe treatment 
but will definitely cure. 
  Do you remember a nursery rhyme ``first grade--to 
immunization, didn't you hear, isn't it us''? It turns out, each 
person has his own individual set of necessary immunizations. 
The clinic examines the presence of protective antibodies to 
many diseases in the blood (tetanus and diphtheria). Provided 
that their amount is sufficient, one can rule out the additional 
unnecessary immunization for each specific person. Here, the 
etiological agent sensitivity to antibiotics is also determined. 
  The most pleasant part is that one does not have to be 
hospitalized. Many of the methods used, as a rule, in hospitals 
are employed here on the outpatient basis. Yet when necessary, 
there is a possibility of hospitalizing the patient in the best 
clinics in Moscow. 
  In the words of the chief physician Oleg Kuzovlev, the 
clinic 
was among the first in the city to receive a license for medical 
insurance and is capable of providing paid medical services to 
both enterprises and private individuals. Clinical treatment 
without stomatological services costs US$200 a year, while 
services with stomatological assistance--US$250 a year, while 
service involving a house call by a dentist costs US$350 a year. 
  Naturally, the payments are made in a ruble equivalent. 
  In the words of the clinic's chief physician, this is not 
expensive when compared to similar services at the treatment 
facilities of the former Fourth Chief Directorate of the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Public Health. 
  One should add that the clinic is located not far from the 
Kolomenskaya subway station at 19 Vysokaya Street, Block 2. 
Telephones for contact are 112-50-60 and 112-02-81.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prof V. F. Gorenkov by N. K. Deryugo; first </F>
three paragraphs are ZDRAVOOKHRANENIYE BELARUSI introduction; 
UDC 614.2(476)(049.3)] 
  [Text]In each civilized nation, its chiefs are always 
concerned about their people, they worry about the people being 
fed, clothed and provided with medical care. If this does not 
exist, a catastrophe occurs: people die of hunger, cold and 
disease. Fortunately, we have been spared hunger and cold, but 
morbidity is rising both among the child and adult population. 
This is related not only to the fact that there are not enough 
pure foodstuffs but also, apparently, preventive measures are 
inadequate and there is no appropriate treatment of the sick. 
  There are not enough drugs for the treatment of 
cardiovascular and oncological diseases, pneumonia, acute and 
chronic intestinal infections, etc. People with diabetes and 
neurological pathology are in a difficult situation. In general, 
if you want to be treated in a hospital bring your medicine with 
you. 
  What arsenal of drugs does our republic have at its disposal 
today? This and other questions were posed by this journal's 
editor-in-chief, N. K. Deryugo to Prof V. F. Gorenkov, general 
director of the BelRPOFarmatsiya [Belorussian Republic 
Production Association ``Pharmacy'']. His answers are published 
below. 
[Question]Valeriy Filippovich, we know that an 
extremely difficult situation exists today with respect to 
providing drugs to the republic's inhabitants. How is this 
problem being solved, and will there be improvement? If so, when? 
[Answer]I have to realize daily the entire depth of 
the crisis with drugs, since we are not yet in a position to 
meet the demands of the public and medical-preventive 
[therapeutic and preventive care] institutions. The shortage of 
drugs in Belarus has become menacing. It is on a par in its 
acuity and scope with the food shortage, and in a number of 
respects exceeds it considerably. Today, our pharmacy network 
has very few diabetic, cardiovascular, psychotropic agents, 
antibiotics, antiseptics, blood substitutes, products needed in 
anesthesiology and resuscitation, vitamins, etc. It has no 
elementary products for colds; mustard plasters, tincture of 
iodine and valerian, brilliant green, bandages, etc., are 
wanting or delivered very irregularly. The existing situation is 
the result of collapse of the former Soviet Union, which 
disrupted the system of centralized drug supply. Unfortunately, 
the pharmaceutical industry is extremely poorly developed in 
Belarus, and the assortment of drugs produced is limited. We 
produce no more than 200 out of 3000 needed drugs. Imported 
drugs constitute about 45 percent of total sales, their 
acquisition is limited since the republic does not have hard 
currency for such purposes. 
  In the existing situation, the employees of Farmatsiya 
Belorussian Republic Production Association are purposefully 
working with suppliers among CIS states, determine requirements, 
directly conclude agreements with manufacturers. Direct contact 
with plants has led to a search for barter. In exchange for 
drugs, the republic had to export to Russia television sets, 
refrigerators, foodstuffs and other consumer goods. Barter 
enabled us to also purchase imported products, since the 
necessary funds for this purpose were not received from the 
government. In the last 2 months, there has been some 
attenuation of the problem with drugs for treatment of 
cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal diseases, 
parkinsonism, bronchial asthma, diseases of the urinary tract, 
etc., by bartering with Hungary, Croatia, Bulgaria, Poland and 
Germany, as well as along the lines of humanitarian aid. 
  Contracts have been elaborated and concluded for 1993 with 
36 
foreign firms, which have promised to deliver vital drugs on YeS 
[European Community?] credit for a sum of about 30 million 
dollars. Contracts have also been concluded with the Germed 
Trade Society for delivery of drugs on German credit for a sum 
of 30 million marks, as well as with 3 firms in India for a sum 
of more than $800,000. In addition, an application has been 
submitted to the State Economic Planning Commission for 
allocation of material and technical resources totaling 40 
million dollars for bartering purchase of the most important 
drugs from foreign firms and plants of CIS states. Drugs covered 
by these contracts will start to be delivered to Belarus as 
early as the first quarter of 1993, which gives us hope that the 
drug crisis will be over. 
[Question]Many scarce drugs are being dispensed to 
patients who get preferential treatment. It is also known that 
there is great abuse. Who makes decisions about such 
preferential treatment, and who are the recipients? How can 
abuse be stopped? 
[Answer]The list of categories of people, as well as 
diseases (which presently number in excess of 50), according to 
which prescription drugs are dispensed in pharmacies, free and 
on preferential terms, is approved by the Belarus Council of 
Ministers at the suggestion of the Ministry of Health. Drugs are 
dispensed free to children (up to 3 years old), those disabled 
since childhood (to 16 years), invalids and participants of the 
Great Patriotic War, diabetics, those suffering from 
tuberculosis, bronchial asthma, spondylitis deformans, 
parkinsonism, oncological and hematological diseases. Drugs are 
free for those who have undergone heart, liver, kidney, etc., 
transplants. Drugs are dispensed at a discount (by prescription) 
to those with grades I and II disability, individuals over 70 
years old, pensioners and other categories of citizens. 
Unfortunately, the difficulty with the drug supply in the 
republic has caused negative elements with respect to use of 
very scarce expensive drugs. It is not uncommon for people who 
enjoy preferential terms to get prescriptions from different 
physicians, obtain free drugs which then appear on the market 
and sold through advertising in newspapers. Incidentally, many 
physicians are to blame for this, for writing prescriptions for 
extremely scarce drugs in larger quantities than needed for a 
course of treatment and, not infrequently, at the patient's 
request, for his relatives and friends. Such infractions and 
abuse could be curbed by abolishing free dispensation of drugs 
to some categories of citizens, replacing it with monetary 
compensation in the appropriate amounts. 
[Question]There are several pharmacies in Minsk where 
drugs are sold for hard currency. Ten analgin tablets cost $4, 
or 2000 rubles. Where do they get hard currency to purchase 
drugs, and does your firm receive some amount for acquisition of 
drugs for an ordinary patient? How is all this delivered to 
Belarus? 
[Answer]At the present time, drugs are sold for hard 
currency in only two pharmacies in Minsk. The pharmacy of the 
joint Belfarm enterprise is not part of the system of the 
Farmatsiya Belarus Republic Production Association. Its founders 
are the German firm Berlin Chemi and the Belarus Ministry of 
Health. They receive drugs from suppliers in Germany. Recently, 
they began to purchase drugs from manufacturers in CIS 
countries. The drugs are sold for hard currency and rubles at 
the rate of exchange on the day of the purchase. 
  Pharmacy No. 61 has a department that sells drugs for hard 
currency which are produced in Poland. There, an SP [sale 
agreement?] has been concluded with the Polish firm Remed, which 
delivers drugs to the pharmacy for sale. The profit from selling 
drugs for hard currency is used by them for their future 
activities. 
[Question]I have heard rumors, which I do not 
entirely believe, that all humanitarian aid remains in these 
pharmacies. What can you say on this score? 
[Answer]I think these rumors are unreliable or very 
exaggerated. Humanitarian aid is not delivered to these 
pharmacies or actually to other pharmacies in the BelRPO 
Farmatsiya system. It is usually delivered directly to 
hospitals, and specialized medical-preventive care institutions. 
Unfortunately, as indicated by the results of questioning 
employees of hospital pharmacies, humanitarian aid is used 
extremely injudiciously, there are instances of selling and 
shipping drugs beyond the Belarus frontiers. Such abuse can be 
arrested by obtaining permission from the Council of Ministers 
to sell these drugs through pharmacies at low prices. 
[Question]You recently became the general director of 
your firm. Do you have a program to improve pharmacy performance 
in the immediate future? Tell us something about yourself. 
[Answer]There is a program for reorganizing pharmacy 
operation as a measure to improve drug supply to the public and 
overcome the economic crisis in the pharmacy network. I refer, 
first of all, to putting the structure of pharmacies in order, 
organizing several compounding pharmacies within pharmacies that 
deal in packaged drugs, organization of company and commercial 
pharmacies, or commercial departments in pharmacies, 
establishment of SP between municipal pharmacies and foreign 
firms, specialization of compounding pharmacies in dispensing 
eye drops, phytoproducts, ointments, species, etc. 
  A little about myself: I was born in 1941 to a family of 
office workers. I graduated from the Pharmaceutical Department 
of VGMI [Voronezh State Medical Institute] in 1964. I worked as 
an instructor in the department of pharmacy organization. In 
1971, I defended my candidatorial dissertation. In 1973, I was 
appointed by competition to the job of senior instructor of the 
department of pharmacy organization and economics at the 
BelGIDUV [Belorussian State Institute for Advanced Training of 
Physicians], where I worked, as a docent at first and then as 
department head. Since June 1992 I have been the general 
director of the BelRPO Farmatsiya. In 1989, I defended by 
doctoral dissertation and received the title of professor. I 
have authored more than 150 scientific works, including 7 
textbooks and educational aids, such as the textbook 
``Organization and Economics of Soviet Pharmacy'' [Organizatsiya 
i ekonomika sovetskoy farmatsii]. I have been awarded the 
Excellent Public Health Worker badge. I am married.

<F P=106> [Article by Garri Yastrebov and Aleksandr Istomin, under the </F>
rubric ``Ecology and Health'': ``Childhood Cannot Be Postponed 
Until Later''; first paragraph is ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI introduction] 
  [Excerpts]At the start of the current school year, 
scientists of the Moscow Research Institute of Hygiene imeni 
Erisman, Professor G. YASTREBOV, doctor of medical sciences, and 
A. ISTOMIN, candidate of medical sciences, not only remind us 
about childhood problems, but offer concrete ways of resolving 
them. [Translator's note: All of Istomin's article follows.] 
  Have you noticed how pale and peaked most of our children 
look lately? Particularly dramatic changes have taken place for 
the kids who live in large cities: their eyes have grown dull, 
less laughter is heard, they do not move around much, and they 
virtually never initiate active games --this requires much 
energy, and that is expressly where all is not well. Why? 
Dramatic worsening of diet, for it is expressly with food that 
we get energy-filled calories so essential to the body. 
  The scientists at the Institute of Nutrition recently 
carried 
out mass-scale studies in different parts of Russia. The results 
are sad: most preschool and school children do not receive in 
their food what their bodies need. Their diet includes few foods 
containing biologically active protein: meat, fish, milk and 
dairy products, as well as fresh vegetables, fruit, and 
vegetable oil. Not so long ago, we worried that our children 
were eating too many sweets, and now they often fail to consume 
the standard amount. But bread, grain and pasta products are 
consumed more and more which, of course, disrupts normal 
function of digestive organs. Up to 20 percent of the children 
are overweight because of this, but this is precisely the case 
where extra weight is not beneficial. And more than 15 percent 
of the higher-grade children have already ``earned'' chronic 
gastrointestinal diseases. Such a formerly rarely encountered 
disease as iron-deficient anemia is now encountered rather often 
in our children (about 10 percent). 
  A group of scientists of our institute carried out 
full-scale 
studies of actual diet of children in secondary schools, 
boarding schools, and PTU [vocational-technical schools] in 
Altay Kray, Komi Republic, Moscow, Tula oblasts and other 
regions. Their conclusions: obviously unbalanced qualitative and 
quantitative composition of diets. These growing children 
consume 14 to 17 percent less foods containing protein than they 
require. There is a particularly enormous shortage of protein of 
animal origin and vegetable oil (in some case up to 50 percent 
deficiency). There are low levels of vitamins C, A, B and some 
minerals (calcium, phosphorus, iodine) in the kids' diet. 
  The results of hygienic studies were confirmed, by 
biochemical parameters, alimentary (nutritional) status, 
anthropometric data, and level of work capacity. Screening of 
12-year-old schoolchildren in Moscow revealed that vitamin C 
levels in blood were below the required allowance in 40 percent 
of them, and at a severely deficient level in 5 percent. Vitamin 
A and E levels in blood were low in one-third of the children. 
In addition, a correlation was demonstrated between impaired 
structure and quality of nutrition, on the one hand, and higher 
susceptibility to colds and infectious diseases, on the other. 
  As yet such pathological states as anemia, rickets, 
dystrophy, avitaminosis and other diseases caused by deficient 
diet have not appeared on a mass scale among children. But the 
standard of living of most inhabitants of Russia continues to 
decline, and if there is no stabilization in the immediate 
future disaster will strike soon: after all, a poor diet in 
childhood and adolescence is dangerous to vital functions, not 
only in this period, but also impairs the foundation for good 
health in subsequent years. We adults and particularly the 
powers that be must realize that a child's body develops 
according to its own physiological laws, and its development 
cannot be deferred to a later date. Children cannot wait for the 
time when, finally, reforms will be carried out, life will 
become good and they will be fed better. And in the meantime, 
should they stop growing? Stop developing? 
  At the present time, management of some administrations (the 
fate and health of our children depends on them to some extent) 
are trying to shift many of their duties to parents: as if to 
say that how children eat depends on them. I agree that the 
family carries the main burden, that poor eating habits (and 
often elementary ignorance of the fundamentals of wise 
nutrition) do indeed ruin a child's health. But now, when 
families are impoverished and, as a rule, struggling to feed the 
children with anything available, the state simply does not have 
the right to let them face this problem alone. 
  In the first place, listening to medical and hygienic 
scientists, there must finally take a position as to the minimal 
``basket'' of consumer products for children. It should be 
consistent primarily with the standards of physiological 
requirements of basic nutrients and energy, and not by the size 
of the state subsidies for organization of nutrition. The 
approximate daily amounts of foods for children and adolescents 
of school age (6 to 17 years) would be as follows, in grams 
(gross): milk -- 500, cottage cheese and products made from it 
-- 40-50, sour cream -- 15-20, butter -- 25-40, cheese -- 10-15, 
meat -- 140-220, fish -- 40-70, 1 egg, vegetable oil --10-20, 
potatoes -- 200-300, other vegetables -- 275-350, fruit, berries 
-- 150-500, rye bread -- 70-150, wheat bread 150-250, grains and 
pasta -- 45-60, sugar, confectionery products -- 70. 
  But, since our children spend most of the day outside their 
home (in kindergartens, schools), another problem arises: to 
provide them with a balanced diet in these institutions. But the 
matter of nutrition is worsening more and more in schools, PTU 
and tekhnikums. In a study of diets of PTU students (15-17 years 
old), hygienists learned that there was a decline in nutritional 
and biological value of the diet: by 22 percent for protein, 43 
percent for fat, and 32 percent for carbohydrates. The caloric 
deficiency constituted 34 percent. 
  Many of us know first hand about the breakfasts and dinners 
in schools. It is not bad enough that children are (usually) 
offered far from the products and food that they require for 
normal vital functions; in addition to everything else, it is 
offered at such a cost that you lose your appetite. Schools are 
by no means concerned about organizing balanced nutrition. Here, 
I as a specialist in the field of optimum nutrition, can see the 
following solution. The state has the right to provide the 
Ministry of Education with a state order: civilized, sound 
two-meal nutrition for schoolchildren should become an integral 
element of the education process. It is worthwhile to ponder 
about another thing: could part of the state subsidy to parents 
for children be switched to schools for organization of 
breakfasts and dinners? Of course, provided it is used for the 
designated purpose. 
  Science will not abandon the problem of child and adolescent 
nutrition. For example, the scientists at our research institute 
have developed preventive programs (and some of them have 
already undergone trials) to optimize nutrition of young 
Russians.

  [Abstract] A study was undertaken to confirm psychic 
influence on the performance of a routine task. Nine psychic- 
subject pairings took part in the experiment. The subject group 
consisted of five women and four men 21 to 38 years old. The 
psychic group consisted of three women and two men 33 to 53 
years old. All of the psychics had from 5 to 17 years experience 
and notable success as healers. Each experiment included 1 
background and 8 experimental sessions, each five minutes long. 
The task of the subjects was to detect a threshold signal 
against a noise background. The task of the psychics was to 
exert a controlled influence on the performance of the subjects, 
who were located in covered, soundproof booths. Four types of 
influence were tested: unconcealed/negative, 
unconcealed/positive, concealed/negative, and 
concealed/positive. For each session, the following indicators 
of success were measured: percentage of correct responses 
(hits); percentage of false anxiety (fa), the sensory 
sensitivity index and the beta decision-making criterion, 
reaction time, reaction time distributions (average reaction 
time, hit and fa reaction times), and the relevant standard 
deviations. A comparative evaluation of subject performance 
showed that the psychics were able to influence the subjects 
during both hidden and open extrasensory influence. Several 
subjects experienced changes in sensory sensitivity itself, but 
these changes on the whole were of a non-specific nature from 
group to group; no positive or negative effect with a one-on-one 
correspondence was established. Change in reaction time 
measurements were detected for both concealed and unconcealed 
extrasensory influence. There were substantial differences in 
the verifiable changes of psychophysical characteristics among 
the different pairings. These differences were attributed to 
both psychic ability and subject sensory sensitivity. Financial 
support for this study was provided by the Russian Basic 
Research Fund (project code: 93-06-10-760). Tables 3; references

  [Abstract] The effects of magnesium, cobalt, manganese, and 
barium salts on the electrical activity of large neurons from 
the central nervous system of the common snail were studied. A 
total of 147 neurons was studied; 47 of the neurons were 
completely isolated, and the remainder were studied while intact 
in the central nervous system. The neurons were immersed in 
normal saline and tested for membrane potential, action 
potential generation threshold and amplitude, and for the 
ability to become accustomed to repeated intracellular 
electrical stimulation. Glass microelectrodes filled with 
potassium citrate with resistances up to 50 æohms were used 
to 
record the electrical characteristics. The same characteristics 
were studied after immersing the intact neurons for 5-10 minutes 
and the isolated neurons for 1-5 minutes in the same solution, 
but with the addition of cobalt, cadmium, and manganese 
chloride. When testing the effects of barium chloride, barium 
was completely substituted for calcium, and the neurons were 
immersed for 15-60 minutes. It was found that cobalt, cadmium 
and manganese ions block the permeability of the neural 
membranes to calcium and reduce their electrical excitability. 
Barium ions compete with calcium ions, increase excitability, 
reduce the action potential generation threshold, and activate 
the pacemaker mechanism. All of the heavy metal ions used in the 
study alter the electrical activity of only those neurons, the 
action potential of which is associated with permeability to 
calcium. They do not affect activity associated with 
sodium-dependent processes. The presence of barium ions blocks 
simple accustomization and facilitated transport processes.

  [Abstract] CC57W male and female mice from the Chernobyl 
and Kiev experimental populations were exposed to low levels of 
ionizing radiation to determine its effect on reproductive 
functioning. The radiation exposure for the test (Chernobyl) 
group was an order of magnitude or more higher than for the 
control (Kiev) group. The external _g_-background radiation 
exposure in the special 30-km vivarium at the Chernobyl nuclear 
power plant fluctuated between 70 to 100 mkR/h. Internal 
radiation exposure was effected by means of radionuclides 
inhaled or otherwise ingested by the mice. Crossbreeding of mice 
three to five months old was done at the Kiev vivarium 
(Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics of the Ukrainian 
Academy of Sciences) within three days after exposure. The 
effect of the radiation exposure was studied by testing for the 
incidence of embryonic mortality in the offspring of the 
experimental and control groups. Pregnant females were dissected 
on the 16th, 17th, or 18th day of gestation, and the incidence 
of pre- and post-implantation mortality was determined from the 
number of yellow masses in the ovaries and from the intrauterine 
implantation and live embryo locations. A consistently high 
incidence of pre-implantation mortality was found in the 
offspring of three generations of female mice and of two 
generations of male mice from the Chernobyl population, an 
obvious consequence of the mutagenic effect of low doses of 
combined radiation on the gametes. This finding was further 
corroborated by the normal incidence of pre-implantation 
mortality among the offspring of the F3-males from 
the Chernobyl population, which were allowed to reach sexual 
maturity without exposure to radiation. Tables 2; references 12:

  [Abstract] Reports that a decrease in hereditary stability 
raises the carcinogenesis risk and that irradiation destabilizes 
the hereditary chromosomal system and, in a long-term, increases 
the cells' sensitivity to mutagenic factors, and evidence that a 
human organism irradiated at the parental gamete stages becomes 
postnatally more sensitive to subsequent mutagenic and 
carcinogenic factors prompted a comparative investigation of the 
stability of the chromosomal system of the Chernobyl clean-up 
crew children in order to predict their likely mutagenesis and 
carcinogenesis risk. To this end, a cytogenetic examination of 
several groups of children from the St. Petersburg region 
irradiated due to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident and 
control group children was carried out. The children were 
divided into seven groups: postnatal irradiation (A), evacuated 
children (A') from Gomel and Bryansk oblasts, intrauterine 
irradiation (B), prezygotic irradiation (C), negative control 
(D), positive control (E), and clinical control (F). The 
chromosomal system stability was assessed by the spontaneous 
chromosomal aberration and micronuclei level in the lymphocytes 
and by the chromosomal radiosensitivity under an in 
vitro exposure of these cells to a 1.5 Gy dose of [.sup]60[/] 
Co _g_-radiation. The findings demonstrate that 
the use of the comprehensive hereditary system stability 
assessment may probably produce more objective criteria for 
identifying the risk groups while the use of in vitro 
test irradiation may be recommended as a procedure for 
evaluating the chromosomal stability. The results also make it 
possible to draw the preliminary conclusion that low-dose 
irradiation of children is a factor which destabilizes the human 
genome. Tables 3; references 7: 2 Russian, 5 Western.

  [Abstract] The interrelationship between the Chernobyl 
nuclear power plant accident clean-up crew morbidity and the 
factors affecting it is studied on the basis of reports 
accumulated by the State Chernobyl Registry. To this end, 
pathological states diagnosed as ``mental disorders'' and 
``nervous system diseases'' are selected due to the fact that 
more than 10% of the patients have been identified as 
having 
these ailments. The following characteristics are considered as 
the risk factors: the date of arrival to the accident zone, the 
length of stay in the zone, and the external irradiation dose. 
This selection is dictated by the assumption of the 
stress-induced mechanism of these illnesses. The disease 
detection time following the arrival at the zone for the 
patients who came before and after the 120th days after the 
accident and bar charts of the disease risk distribution for the 
proportional and kurtosis models are plotted. An analysis shows 
that arrival at the accident zone before the 120th day and the 
duration of stay are indeed the principal risk factor for the 
development of mental and nervous system disorders. The external 
irradiation dose is identified as a risk factor which only 
slightly affects morbidity; it is speculated that this factor is 
an artifact arising due to the statistical correlation between 
the length of stay in the zone and the irradiation dose received 
therein. The conclusion is drawn that a simple proportional 
model describes morbidity most adequately while the model which 
reflects kurtosis is not consistent with morbidity. Figures 4; 
tables 2.

  [Abstract] The morbidity patterns among more than 96 
thousand Ukrainian residents exposed to radionuclide 
contamination and relocated from the town of Pripyat and 
Chernobyl and from over 90 rural settlements in Kiev and 
Zhitomir oblasts after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant 
accident are investigated. An analysis of the data from the 
Ukrainian National Registry on 61,066 persons, including 44,724 
adults and adolescents, is presented, and the relocated 
population morbidity dynamics are summarized for 1987-1991. The 
findings shows that the proportion of healthy vs. examined 
patients reveals a steady declining trend: 56.68, 51.58, 44.09, 
35.3, and 28.8%, respectively. It is noted that to date, 
the 
relocation program has not been fully implemented although the 
doses received by the residents of Pripyat average 3-5 cSv, 
reaching 12 cSv for some individuals, vs. 20-50 cSv for the 
approximately 1,000 persons living within the 30-km zone. An 
analysis indicates that due to the combined effect of radiation 
exposure and stress, morbidity has increased annually from 265.0 
thousand cases in 1986 to 1,037.8 thousand in 1991. The 
morbidity structure changed too: in 1986, circulatory 
(34.1%), 
digestive (21%), skeletomuscular (9.6%), 
respiratory (8.9%), 
and nervous and sensory (7.9%) diseases were the leading 
causes 
of illness whereas in 1991, the nervous and sensory system 
(18.4%), respiratory (17.6%), circulatory 
(16.7%), digestive 
(14.8%), and skeletomuscular and connective tissue 
(9.17%) 
diseases became the leading causes of illness. The findings 
indicate an annual rise in morbidity for all classes of disease, 
especially the endocrinic system and neoplasms and show that 
morbidity among women is higher than that among men in all age 
groups, especially for the endocrinic, nervous, and 
hematopoietic systems. Tables 1.

<F P=106> [Article: ``A Protector by the Name of Thymogen''; first </F>
paragraph is ZDOROVYE introduction] 
  [Text]In view of publications about peptide bioregulators, 
and with appearance in pharmacies of the first one, thymogen, 
readers began to write the editorial office asking to tell about 
the properties of thymogen, whether or not it is dangerous to 
use immunomodulators. These questions are answered by Sergey 
Mikhaylovich FURGAL, candidate of medical sciences, assistant in 
one of the departments of the Military Medical Academy in St. 
Petersburg. 
  ``For 8 years now specialists in the department of military 
and general epidemiology are working on systematic validation of 
the principles of immunocorrection to prevent influenza, acute 
respiratory infections, sore throat, acute pneumonia, and 
suppurative skin diseases. We studied how epidemics break out in 
large organized groups of adults. A similar situation is found 
in kindergartens and schools. There always are so-called 
frequently sick individuals in every group. They usually 
constitute 15-17 percent. But, as a rule, they account for 60-80 
percent of morbidity and, mainly, play a deciding role in 
development of an epidemic. 
  We also considered the fact that many pathogens of 
infectious 
diseases against which there are no vaccines circulate among the 
people. After all, sore throats, pneumonia, and acute 
respiratory viral infections can be caused by the most varied 
viruses or bacteria. Furthermore, in a patient, both the 
infection proper and adverse ecological conditions, as well as 
the not uncommon stresses at the present time, weaken immunity 
first of all. This is why we are searching for effective agents 
to prevent infectious diseases among products that can enhance 
resistance and improve the immune status of the body. 
  We have examined about 10 different drugs. And we decided on 
thymoline (thymogen), a peptide preparation. This bioregulator 
turned out to be the most physiological, safest, and does not 
require special supervision during intake. For example, when 
dibasol hydrochloride is used to prevent influenza blood 
pressure has to be monitored. But thymogen can be taken by 
anyone independently. There has not been a single case of 
allergic reaction to it or any other adverse side-effect. 
  Preventive intake of thymogen in specially developed doses 
solves three problems: --to enhance immunoresistance of large 
population groups, lower morbidity and complications in groups, 
as well as absenteeism; --to correct immunity deficiencies in 
people who are often sick for long periods of time, and improve 
their health; --to enhance the immune response to inoculations 
(for example, influenza vaccine) with possible lowering of 
vaccine dosage and longer persistence of immunity. If an 
individual takes at least three thymogen injections along with 
vaccine, his resistance to influenza stays high for about 2 
years. 
  Unfortunately, once in a while there are items in the press 
to the effect that all interventions in the immune system are 
harmful. This is an unwarranted fear. Our many years of 
observation indicate not only that cytomedin-bioregulators are 
entirely safe, but also that thymogen is of enormous benefit to 
people, with its significant preventive efficacy. 
  How is thymogen taken? What is better, injections or nose 
drops? Both routes are effective. But hypodermic injection 
maintains the appropriate level of resistance to disease for 
about 8 months, but not from the very first days. In drop form, 
thymogen has an immediate action and is active for about 2 
months. 
  For an essentially healthy person, it is enough to instill 
0.5 ml solution in each nasal passage for 3 days at the start of 
the seasonal rise in respiratory diseases. It is beneficial to 
do this for people returning to work after a leave, children 
when they start kindergarten or school after vacation (the 
dosage is the same for all). Of course, thymogen should be 
instilled as a preventive measure if sick cases occur in a group 
or at home, or if one experiences early signs of malaise. Those 
who are sick frequently, weakened after surgery, or stress can 
use thymogen for up to 10 days. 
  After 2 months, instillation for 3 days can be repeated if 
necessary (for example, when a new wave of respiratory disease 
is expected, or when going to work on a farm). But even if one 
gets sick, the disease will be overcome sooner and without 
complications under the protection of thymogen.''

  [Abstract] The urgency of combatting purulent infection 
using various antibacterial preparations and antiseptics which 
have a number of advantages over antibiotics and the arbitrary 
and empirical manner in which antiseptics are often prescribed 
necessitated a comparative study of the antimicrobial activity 
of chlorhexidin, decamethoxin, and septonex relative to hospital 
strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa and pathogenic forms of the enterobacteria 
species. Sensitivity to antiseptics was measured by diluting the 
preparations in a dense nutrient medium and establishing the 
minimum inhibiting concentration (MIK) for each strain. An 
analysis shows that in therapeutic concentrations, chlorhexidin, 
decamethoxin, and septonex inhibit the growth of all hospital 
strains of S. aureus and 48-78% of hospital strains 
of enterobacteria. Yet all hospital strains of P. 
aeruginosa are tolerant to decamethoxin and septonex while 
28.0% is tolerant to chlorhexidin. The conclusion is 
drawn that 
the use of the above antiseptics against hospital infections 
should be based on studies of the microorganisms' sensitivity to 
these preparations. Tables 1; references 7.

  [Abstract] The danger of uncontrollable exposure of humans 
to ionizing radiation due to, e.g., nuclear accidents, and the 
shortcomings of existing natural and synthetic polymer drugs 
administered for radiation sickness, such as side effects, 
prompted continued search for compounds with a therapeutic 
antiactinic action which are free of this drawback. To this end, 
the anti-actinic and other biological properties of the 
2-methyl-5-vinylpyridine and N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymer 
(sovidon) are investigated in order to assess the outlook for 
its applications as a means of early acute radiation sickness 
treatment. The experiment was carried out on 20-24 g noninbred 
white hybrid mice (CBAxC57B1)F[.sub]1[/], 60-80 g hamsters, 
180-220 g rats, 280-350 g guinea pigs, 11-17 kg noninbred dogs, 
large 25-35 kg Romanov breed sheep, and Macaca 
fascicularis monkeys. The animals were exposed to general 
brief 0.5-1.5 Gy/min [.sup]60[/]Co irradiation or extended 
0.01 Gy/min [.sup]137[/]Cs irradiation. The copolymer was 
intramuscularly administered in the form of a 10% 
solution, and 
the modification of biological factors was monitored. The 
antiactinic therapeutic efficacy of sovidon--the copolymer 
developed by the Kovidon pharmaceutical company--in various 
types of animals at various doses, sovidon's treatment 
efficiency for prolonged irradiation, the tumor development 
rate, the effect of combined use of various antiactinic measures 
on the outcome of radiation injury in dogs, and sovidon's 
antiactinic efficiency when using drugs which mitigate its side 
effects are summarized. The findings confirm that given adequate 
experimental verification, sovidon may find applications in 
other branches of medicine (oncology, pulmonology, and 
hematology) or veterinary practices. The authors are grateful to 
B.A. Titov, E.P. Korovkina, P.A. Vlasov, V.N. Izvekov, L.V. 
Bogatov, and L.N. Dubov for assistance with experiments an 
constructive discussion of the findings. Tables 5; references

  [Abstract] Increasing uses of dalargin--an opioid peptide 
and synthetic counterpart of Leu-enkephalin--for treatment of 
stomach and duodenum disorders and a lack of studies of 
dalargin's effect on the acidogenic function of the stomach in 
stomach and duodenum ulcer patients prompted an examination of 
54 such patients (40 men and 14 women) with stomach (11) and 
duodenum (43) ulcer. The largest group was made by 18-39 year 
old (31 patients). All patients were divided into two groups: in 
the first (8 patients), 0.5 mg of dalargin was administered 
intravenously and in the second, 1 mg was administered to 46 
patients; the acidogenic function was examined by pH-metry. An 
analysis shows that no significant changes occurred in the first 
group after a single dalargin injection or after a two-week 
treatment course. In the second group, dalargin injection 
inhibited the acidogenic function some 3-4 min later in duodenum 
ulcer patients; this function remained inhibited for 30-40 min. 
In the case of a treatment course, dalargin stimulates the 
alkalizing function of the antral stomach section and, to a 
lesser extent, suppresses the acidogenic function of the stomach 
body and fundus. References 3.

  [Abstract] Increasing applications of low-intensity laser 
radiation for treatment of various cardiovascular diseases, 
e.g., hypertension, prompted an investigation of the efficacy of 
low-intensity laser irradiation for treatment of hypertension by 
affecting the projection areas of sinocarotid zones in a pulsed 
mode biosynchronized with the physiological activity of the 
carotid artery barozones. To this end, 21 men and 7 women aged 
17-54 were exposed to low-intensity laser radiation, and the 
treatment efficiency was monitored by the patients' state of 
health, arterial pressure, and central hemodynamic indicators 
determined with the help of an R4-02 bipolar thoracic rheograph. 
An analysis of the central hemodynamic indicators after a course 
of treatment shows that the use of low-intensity laser 
irradiation has a verifiable hypotensive impact, improves the 
patients' subjective status, and produces no side effects. Such 
laser therapy may also be used as an independent treatment 
method for categories I and II hypertension patients. The 
systolic/diastolic pressure was reduced from 151.8/96.8 before 
the treatment to 135/88 after the treatment. Tables 1;

on Permanent Strike, but Would Prefer to Talk'']

<H5>  Discontent </H5>
  Scientists of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), 
inspired 
by their trade union, have gathered to picket the building of 
the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation. The demands 
of participants in the strike are not very different from the 
ultimatums to the government stated by miners, oil field workers 
or communications workers. ``We want payment of what is owing to 
the RAS for 1993, payment of the shortfall for January and 
February of 1994, compensation for inflation due to late 
allocation of funds for the pay raise in 1993, and also 
reimbursement for incomplete compensation of increased cost of 
communal payments for the period from 1 April 1993 through 1 
February 1994.'' So goes the printed statement of the Trade 
Union of Workers of the RAS addressed to Sergey Dubinin, acting 
ministry of finances of Russia. According to calculations of 
union bosses of the RAS, the total indebtedness of the 
government to the Academy of Sciences is more than 108 billion 
rubles per year. 
  But this time, they did not strike, preferring talks with 
the 
government. However, unfortunately extreme forms of protest 
(strikes and the like) have become a very popular ploy among 
Russian scientists. More precisely, among their trade unions. 
There might be more of them on strike than miners. And so what? 
A whole series of demonstrations put on by scientists, draping 
the statue of General Lomonosov in rags and symbolically burying 
science, have not wrested a single copeck from the budget. As 
the noted economist Nikolay Shmelev recently remarked, the 
government has no money to be found, even on the night-table of 
the minister of finances. 
  In return, the very theoretical and research activity for 
which the RAS is fighting has suffered considerable losses 
because of these actions. In the words of Professor Granit 
Fedorov, one of the organizers of picketing of the Ministry of 
Finance and of a proposed subsequent nationwide protest, member 
of the Russian council of the trade union of the RAS, for the 
last two decades the rate of doubling of human knowledge has 
grown by a factor of more than 50, and the loss of each day of 
creative activity is in proportion. 
  In answer to the question of SEGODNYA's correspondent 
whether 
trade unions of scientists are capable of any forms of 
protecting the interests of their members that are more 
constructive than pickets and strikes, Vladimir Khlebodarov, 
director of trade unions of the RAS, stated that the trade union 
is ``ready to talk about the substance of the demands.'' But it 
would seem that in this country at this time, the outcome of 
such talks is foreordained.

<F P=106> [Interview with Academician Boris Kadomtsev, Nikolay </F>
Ponomarev-Stepnoy, Spartak Belyayev and Associate Member of the 
RAS Nikolay Chernoplekov by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA Reviewer Leonard 
Nikishin; place and date not given: ``Nuclear Researchers Having 
an Off-Season. Leading Scientists of Kurchatov Institute Talk 
About Coming Changes''] 
txt}[Text] OG: Many have attributed the current 
decline in prestige of science directly to the Chernobyl 
disaster, while scientists, the creators of new sources of 
energy, are seen as Greeks bearing gifts of which one must 
beware at all costs... 
  Ponomarev-Stepnoy: Clearly, this is the wrong 
approach. The causes of the disaster lay in a sociopolitical 
system, rather than in science. It must be kept in mind that for 
decades the nuclear industry was a state within a state, 
entirely out of contact with the other world: there were cities 
not shown on any map, the strictest discipline was maintained in 
classified combines. This is what drove all nuclear danger 
inward. And this rigid and closed system produces a child and 
turns it loose on God's world. And no one even stops to think 
about how to fix things so that this child does not make a devil 
of a mess. None of the necessary steps were taken to safeguard 
the existence of nuclear power outside the confines of the state 
within a state. 
  Chernoplekov: The late Anatoliy Petrovich 
Aleksandrovich, a pioneer and staunch supporter of nuclear 
power, started getting uneasy rather early on. He repeatedly 
reported to the management that the intensive development in 
this field had its down side as well, and that immediate steps 
were needed. And incidentally, he did manage to get some steps 
taken at the time. The Nuclear Power Oversight was his 
initiative, as was the introduction of military certification of 
all goods for nuclear electric power plants. 
  OG: Heretofore, the entire structure of Soviet 
science had been determined by the part it had to play in the 
socialist society. Now we are converting to a market economy, 
and yet this structure remains virtually unchanged... 
  Belyayev: Science is not alone in having that 
trouble. We have all been living in a society with distorted 
proportions. We had a huge army, huge science--true pearls in 
the crown of the Soviet Empire! Consider this unique phenomenon: 
the existence of an enormous number of political, economic and 
sociological institutes. No one nation has such a thing. And all 
these institutes were in fact subsidiary institutions of the 
Central Committee of the CPSU. In many areas, we have 
proportions that have been broken. Of course, science needs 
restructuring, that's obvious. 
  OG: With regard to the ``brain drain'' to the 
West, the problem is perhaps exaggerated at the moment. The more 
so in the case of your field... 
  Belyayev: In our nuclear centers, the situation is 
just about hopeless. They are having a tough time getting 
reoriented. There is virtually no problem of a ``brain drain'' 
to the West in the nuclear industry. For us it is something 
else: there is no ``replenishment'' of key personnel. Out of 96 
graduates of our department at the Physicotechnical Institute, 
40 have gone over to the West. Half of the remaining 56 have 
gone to commercial banks. And incidentally, you can now find 
Physicotechnical Institute graduates in the management of just 
about any commercial bank. 
  Kadomtsev: If you add up the number of papers that 
have been written by the most eminent scientists, it turns out 
that half the papers are being written by a number equal to the 
square root of the total number of scientists, and they are the 
source of half the work. Extract the square root of the million 
scientists that we now have in our nation, and you get a 
thousand people actively creating science. What is the outcome? 
You can't tell me that there aren't many people leaving. In 
fact, if you take a thousand eminent scientists, and out of 
those there are thirty of the front leaders going elsewhere, the 
scientific potential is cut in half. 
  It is not only the number of talented scientists that is 
significant. They have an impact, as it were, on the whole 
coloring. If schools of science fall away, so does the 
scientific potential. It is for this reason that we have to keep 
an eye on who is leaving. And unfortunately, the ones leaving 
are the most talented. About three years ago, it was barely 
noticeable, and now it is obvious. On the other hand, you can 
hear Russian being spoken in literally any U.S. university. I 
have seen many of our graduates there. Their potential, of 
course, has considerably increased because Russian scientists 
are nothing at all like their Western colleagues. Our scientists 
have a different ``set'' from those of the West. There a 
scientist, like any engineer, is narrowly specialized. On the 
other hand, here in one continuous tangle a person has to be 
much more broadly educated and diverse to have a normal 
existence. When our people reach the West, they have a 
tremendous advantage over Western specialists simply by virtue 
of their education and our specific character. 
the indigenous ``families''... 
  Kadomtsev: There is yet another side to the issue: 
the role, place and volume of research that our nation can allow 
itself. Prior to perestroyka, the USSR was second in science 
only to the United States. Now the empire has crumbled, and the 
information loss has been enormous. Without the ability to 
communicate, the potential began to decline very rapidly. 
Secondly, science lost its prestigious position in the nation, 
which is part of a general pattern. There had been a huge empire 
which, like any empire, had been watching out for its crown, for 
its facade. It is no exaggeration to say that this facade was 
magnificent. Excellent education, advanced technology, 
leading-edge science on a par with Western standards. But 
unfortunately, the rest of the infrastructure of the nation 
could not be pulled up to this level. Of course, from time to 
time it was remembered that help was sometimes needed in rural 
areas. They got us together and sent us out to a collective farm 
to bring in the harvest. We were puzzled about the reason for 
sending intellectuals to do such work, why workmen were not sent 
instead. But the workmen were elsewhere, helping out in the 
``boondocks.'' Now it is clear that science as it exists in 
Russia is unfortunately larger in scale than the Russian 
potential can support. Even if the present government had the 
desire to act and support the facade on the same level (it is 
not in fact so concerned), it could not now be done. Once we had 
a privileged position. But another component of society had been 
decapitated, and the potential sucked out. The management that 
should have existed in a normal nation was underdeveloped. It 
did not absorb young blood. Today, young people have realized 
that by working in this field one can achieve a much better 
standard of living and have chances to improve one's position in 
society. It is natural that our alumni are now looking at 
commercial banks rather than at Kurchatov Institute. In fact, 
even earlier we should have been sharing with management, where 
there is a need for young people. 
  At one time our former prime minister Valentin Pavlov said: 
``All of Soviet science is working for the West.'' And although 
it is harsh and coarse, the quote is not groundless. Science is 
international. All results of research, except for what is 
classified, are published in the scientific press and are the 
property of the world community. Scientists of different nations 
form ``invisible colleges'' that are thoroughly familiar with 
one another's work, and react instantaneously to the 
corresponding results. But different nations put the product of 
science to different uses. ``Balanced nations'' like the United 
States very rapidly transform scientific knowledge and 
technology into new goods. And thereby they enrich their nation. 
But we have failed to tune our internal social organism with 
sufficient finesse. 
  OG: On the other hand, we see that the United 
States has not just ``jumped'' at building its own orbital 
station. A joint project with Russia has been agreed to. And for 
a measly 400 million dollars, we give up everything we have, all 
our unique technologies. 
  Ponomarev-Stepnoy: Of course, we could elect not 
to give it up. But then our space technology would die. Here is 
the dilemma: to give it up, or not to give it up and perish. The 
Americans take us as partners, and we give them a lot. But so 
what? We should learn to work like they do. I can cite a 
specific example. We have sold the United States nuclear power 
plants for spacecraft. We have invested a certain part of the 
proceeds in development of new technologies. Among other things, 
we have financed the development of new coolants for 
refrigerators. Something that the United States and other 
nations have been working on to no avail so far. They have 
passed a law: no freons down and worked out a formula for a 
coolant that will not harm the ozone layer and can be used in 
existing refrigerators. However, we have this fluid without 
freons that no one has need of. We wanted to take out a patent, 
so the Americans told us: ``As soon as you publish everything, 
we will make the same fluid, adding, say, one atom of argon. 
Then it will be our patent. We will simply take your fluid and 
charge our refrigerators with it. You can take us to court and 
be in litigation for ten years. Assume that you win the suit. We 
pay you 500,000 dollars, you will spend millions to get it, and 
we will get billions.'' So learning to get into the market is 
not that simple. We must pay our dues with our brains and our 
technologies. 
  Belyayev: A characteristic feature of our science 
has been that fundamental research was most open. There was a 
maximum of international exchange. A lot of it has already been 
incorporated into world science. But the most material intensive 
and fund intensive, and perhaps the most important research for 
our science was classified as a rule. Here it must have been no 
worse for us than for them, even if more costly. Now the 
greatest problems have come up in these areas. 
  Chernoplekov: Russia will inevitably produce a 
certain amount of talent per unit of time per unit of space. In 
accordance with the conditions that we will bring about, talents 
will be distributed: political, military, scientific... We know 
that in Germany after the war at one time science was wiped out. 
Talented young people were leaving the country. And now when we 
travel to Germany we see that kids and people returning from the 
West are working in science there. There is almost no middle 
link. We should understand this and make efforts to avoid it. 
  Belyayev: And how do we keep our young people for 
science? I do not agree that it is such a tragedy that young 
specialists are going over to the West. I don't know what is 
better: going off and retaining what they have while developing 
in science, or staying here and not getting into it at all. And 
why believe that none of them will ever return, and that we will 
not reap the benefit for our science from what they are now 
doing? The large contingent of our former citizens who are now 
living in Israel opens up a broad exit to other fields and 
nations, and we ought to take advantage of it. Thousands of 
Chinese are scattered throughout the world, and China is now 
getting a lot from its compatriots, they are bringing their 
potential to the homeland.

<F P=106> [Conversation with Yuriy Naydo, director of the Center of </F>
Structural Studies and Industrial Policy of IMEPI RAN, and 
Stanislav Simanovskiy, director of the sector of innovative 
policy of the same institute: ``Technological Sovereignty'' is 
Much Easier to Lose Than to Recover''] 
  [Text] One of the problems that is coming up as Russia 
moves toward a market economy is the necessity of reinforcing 
national technological security. However, this is not only a 
consequence of market reforms, but also a condition for success 
of these reforms. After all, scientific-technical potential is 
practically the only strategic resource that Russia can rely on 
to extricate herself from economic crisis. We decided to turn 
the podium over to specialists who have long and persistently 
tried to call the attention of the authorities and the public to 
this issue. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA was visited by Yuriy Naydo, 
director of the Center of Structural Studies and Industrial 
Policy of IMEPI RAN, and Stanislav Simanovskiy, director of the 
sector of innovative policy of the same institute. 
  Yuriy Naydo: Unfortunately, failure of the state 
to take action is leading to Russia's de facto loss of 
``technological sovereignty'': scientific-technical potential is 
rapidly being destroyed, erosion of key personnel is glaringly 
evident, the material-technical and informational base of 
science is deteriorating, and scientific-technical projects lie 
dormant. 
  A situation where science is being transformed to nothing 
but 
expense is one of the terrible signs of loss of technological 
security of the nation. This is inevitably followed by a 
widening lag behind the world community and lopsided 
technological dependence on developed Western nations that will 
be very difficult to overcome. 
  As a result, our nation will be unable to make a claim to 
participation in the international division of labor as a 
partner on equal footing, and will be condemned to continually 
pumping a considerable fraction of its national income over to 
the use of states on a higher stage of scientific-technical 
development. 
  Stanislav Simanovskiy: As we change over to the 
market, to an open economy, there is a sharp increase in the 
role of international cooperation. Without it, Russian science 
will be hard put to survive, since there is almost no internal 
demand on the transitional stage for domestic scientific and 
engineering advances. And this means that without international 
cooperation we cannot avoid the collapse of the 
scientific-technical potential of Russia. But this is only one 
obvious aspect of the problem. Another aspect is not so obvious 
at first glance. The fact is that international cooperation, 
allowed to find its own level, objectively carries the threat of 
a decline in national technological security. This is confirmed 
if only by the example of today's assistance given by the world 
community to Russian science. Today the volume of such 
assistance (both actually provided and pledged) is about $600 
million. More than ten different funds have been established in 
the West to support science in Russia. Among others, there are 
the well known Soros Fund that allocates 100 million dollars to 
CIS nations for 1993-1994, the U.S. National Science Fund ($25 
million), the Mitterrand Fund, General European Fund (4 million) 
and so on. 
  In my opinion, Russia ought to accept such help with 
gratitude. But in doing so, she is obliged to take care that 
this assistance does nothing to harm the technological security 
of the nation. 
  For instance just take the system of gathering information 
about research and development, scientific institutions and key 
researchers when submitting requests for grants and other aid. 
It gives the West an exhaustive picture of Russian scientific- 
technical potential. And it does this in detail that at times is 
not accessible to Russian governmental agencies responsible for 
the development of science and engineering. The most promising 
research and the most productive scientists can be freely used 
in the interests of Western science, engineering, and economy as 
a whole. In particular, by offering stipends to the most capable 
students, contracts for internship and work abroad to the most 
promising young scientists and specialists. By financing 
individual scientists and teams, providing research equipment, 
the West is actually setting up in Russia its own kind of 
industry to serve its own economy. In truth, whoever pays can 
call the tune. There is also the potential possibility of saving 
individual areas of Russian science and engineering, and even 
shutting them off from considerations of the competitive 
struggle. In their attempts to earn some cash, our scientists 
are ready to take next to nothing for transfer abroad of 
research results, many of which surpass the world level and are 
the genuine national property of Russia. And in essence, all of 
this is nothing more than flow to the West of Russian national 
wealth without equivalent reimbursement. 
  Naydo: Under conditions of a totalitarian regime, 
autarkic economy (i.e. closed, self-sufficient), technological 
security was looked at primarily in the context of 
military-political rivalry, the arms race. With the transition 
to an open market economy, its content shifts toward the 
economic sphere. Today, technological security should primarily 
ensure success of the nation in the hard competitive struggle 
for the world market. And there is feedback between 
technological security and competition: the stronger the 
competitive positions of a nation on the world market, the 
stronger will be its technological security. 
  Simanovskiy: Active political and diplomatic 
measures will be needed to stop the discriminatory practice of 
the West that was introduced during the years of the Cold War 
and that makes it difficult for our nation to have access to 
world advances in science and engineering. Now it looks like the 
process is slowly moving in the reverse direction. Nevertheless, 
there are still no guarantees that limitations of this kind will 
be reinstated in full measure if political development in Russia 
should be interpreted as unfavorable for the West. 
  Naydo: An effective solution to the problem is not 
to return to yesterday's autarky, but rather the reverse, to 
reinforce and develop the closest and strongest contacts with 
the world community. Most optimum are cooperative ties 
distinguished by forming equal technological 
interdependence of partners. This safeguards uniform 
technological dependence of participants in international 
cooperation. It means equality of economic conditions of 
international exchange, precluding redistribution of the 
national income of the less developed partner to the advantage 
of the more developed partner. It also means equality of 
potential loss in the case of breaking of technological ties. 
  The tasks of retaining the scientific-technical potential of 
Russia and preventing lopsided technological dependence on the 
West are intimately intertwined. However, they need to be 
handled by different approaches. Financial support of science is 
needed to retain our scientific-technical potential. In addition 
to that, prevention of lopsided technological dependence 
requires that the state and the private sector keep a watch on 
utilization of our stock of inventions, developments and 
technologies. A watch that on the one hand encourages 
international competition, and on the other hand sets up a 
barrier to squandering of national scientific-technical 
achievements of strategic significance. Such supervision, based 
mainly on economic methods, should be an integral part of a 
unified state scientific-technical policy. 
  Simanovskiy: Problems of technological security 
should be permanently on the agenda, and the topic of at least a 
yearly report by the President and the government. Such an 
approach would force the leadership of the nation to look at the 
literally perishing scientific-technical potential, academic, 
industrial and institutional science, the enormous defense 
conversion sector of the economy, and the military-industrial 
complex, at coming up with a scientifically sound governmental 
scientific-technical policy. 
  Legislative support is needed as well: a codex of laws about 
the scientific-technical policy of the state, the academic 
scientific establishment, the status of the scientist, 
protection of intellectual property, transfer of technologies 
from defense to civilian sectors, governmental classified and 
confidential items, and also a block of laws and normatives 
regulating the process of the brain drain both out of Russia to 
other nations, and out of nations of the former USSR into Russia. 
  Naydo: Federal agencies of authority ought to have 
a clear idea about what the nation still has at its disposal in 
the technological sense. This would be aided by an inventory of 
scientific and engineering attainments of the nation, an 
assessment of the prospects for commercial sales on foreign 
markets, ascertainment of areas where we lead and lag with 
respect to the world level, and accordingly determination of 
priority areas of technological export and import. 
  Simanovskiy: Apparently, we also need an agency on 
acquiring and utilizing international material and technological 
assistance for Russian science. Such assistance requires 
coordination on a multilateral level; among other things, 
setting up an information system, a unified financial fund or 
bank, an insurance company, and the like. The main thing is 
maximum simplification of access to outside sources of funding 
for all deserving claimants. 
  The problem of technological security of the nation will not 
be solved in one day. It is going to take constant and 
persistent attention. But the steps that we have proposed are 
only a part of what is needing to be handled without delay. 
Tomorrow it will be too late. For now there is still a chance of 
rectifying the situation.

<F P=106> [Excerpts from speech by President of the Russian </F>
Academy of Sciences Yuriy Osipov at the March 1994 General 
Meeting of the Russian Academy of Sciences, under the rubric 
``Science: The Hour of Choice. Guided by a Wise Budget'': 
``Science Will Not Remain in Debt''--first six paragraph are 
POISK introduction] 
  [Text] Each time, when attending a general meeting of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences, you try to detect in what is 
happening something new, a mark of what has been introduced into 
science by our fast-paced times. What is meant are not only the 
problems and achievements of academic science, an extensive list 
of which was contained in the speech of RAS [Russian Academy of 
Sciences] President Yuriy Osipov and the report of Chief 
Scientific Secretary of the Academy Igor Makarov, but also the 
changes, which affect the overall mood and future of the 
scientific community. This time the meeting took place, it 
appears, guided by timid hopes for bright prospects for the RAS 
this year. The State Duma Decree ``On the Crisis in Russian 
Science'' and the changed, as one wants to hope, attitude of the 
government toward the needs of research collectives became the 
culture medium of the cautious optimism of scientists. In the 
draft of the federal budget, which the State Duma should pass, 
the science line is supported by a figure that for the present 
is quite reassuring. Moreover, they are also promising to pay 
last year's debts. Vladimir Khlebodarov, president of the 
Council of Trade Unions of Workers of the RAS, acquainted people 
with a letter, which was addressed to the council by Deputy 
Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation A. Astakhov. Here 
are a few excerpts from this letter: 
  ``In the draft of the budget of the Russian Federation for 
1994 the reimbursement of the outlays on the repayment of the 
debt during the past year in the amount of 22.9 billion rubles 
[R] is envisaged for the RAS and its regional departments. 
  Moreover, the amounts of financing of these institutions, 10 
percent of which were sequestrated and which were envisaged by 
the draft of the republic budget of the Russian Federation for 
the second through fourth quarters of that year in the amount of 
R60.2 billion, were restored. 
  The appropriations were increased by R16.4 billion in March 
of that year in connection with the increase in December 1993 of 
the minimum wage by 1.9-fold." 
  And although no one saw the promised money, and no one knows 
when it will begin to arrive, the spirit of hope hovered above 
the heads of those who had gathered. For some it resurrected the 
dream of returning to the good old times--at that time familiar 
exultant self-reports with prospects for a subsidy were heard 
from the rostrum. Before others the hope afforded new prospects, 
and they spoke about what is needed in order to make them come 
true and proposed their own means of the organization and 
development of Russian academic science. 
  In this issue we acquaint the readers with brief accounts of 
the speech of Yu. Osipov and the report of I. Makarov at the 
general meeting of the RAS. Lists of the newly elected full 
members and corresponding members of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences are published on page 2 of the newspaper.'' 
<H5>  Science Will Not Remain in Debt </H5>
  In describing the situation, under which the academy 
operated, it is possible, unfortunately, to repeat much of what 
was said in the speeches at the general meetings in December 
1992 and April 1993 and to speak about the confusion of 
statewide goals and guidelines, including in the area of 
science, about the deformation of social values, about the 
destruction of historical traditions, and about the problems of 
science, culture and education under the conditions of the 
economic crisis and political upheavals. 
  But however difficult it is for us, our academy is being 
preserved and is operating, it is playing a decisive role in 
Russian science--as the most important component of the 
spiritual and intellectual wealth of Russia. The main 
contribution of the academic community of the present and future 
of science also lies in this. 
  In my speech I would like not only to speak about several 
results of the year, but also to touch upon a number of very 
urgent and difficult problems, with which the academy had 
occasion to be faced. 
  I should say at once that, in spite of all the difficulties 
which the meeting participants know better than anyone, the 
academy succeeded as a whole in maintaining a high level of 
conducted research. 
  (The president dwelt in detail on the achievements, by which 
the work of a number of scientific collectives of the RAS was 
commended.) 
  Only individual examples of the scientific results of the 
year under review were named. I, of course, do not have the 
opportunity to mention other results. But such results exist. 
And this inspires certain optimism. 
  I will speak about several other aspects of our activity. 
  I will recall that our regional departments are financed by 
a 
separate line in the state budget. The total budget of the 
academy in 1993 was R141 billion. Incidentally, in comparable 
prices it is one-fourth to one-tenth as much (here the estimates 
are different) as the 1990 budget. I stress that it is 
one-fourth to one-tenth as much as the 1990 budget. 
  We failed to receive R22 billion last year, mainly during 
the 
fourth quarter, therefore, the budget was fulfilled by 
approximately 85 percent. And the fact that this indicator is 
higher than in other scientific departments of Russia, of 
course, is not comforting. And how the academy literally monthly 
wrung out these meager assets is a theme for another discussion. 
  A few words about scientific personnel. The presidium of the 
RAS tried to do everything possible to preserve the personnel 
potential of the staff of the academy. In 1992 the total number 
of workers decreased by 4.5 percent and in 1993, by 3.7 percent. 
Here the number of candidates of sciences decreased by 1.4 
percent, while the number of doctors of sciences even increased 
by 5.6 percent. This testifies that people are defending 
doctoral dissertations, in spite of all the difficulties. It is 
gratifying that after the sharp decrease of the hiring to 
academic institutes of young specialists by a factor of 3.5 in 
the last three years during the year under review this process 
has been starting to stabilize somewhat--1,149 people came to 
us, I have in mind the central part of the academy, which is 
slightly more than in 1992. Some change in the dynamics of 
admission to graduate studies emerged. In 1993, 767 graduate 
students were registered. This exceed by 100 this indicator in 
1992. However, the total number of people studying in academic 
graduate studies decreased from 5,000 in 1992 to 4,220 in 1993. 
The ``brain drain,'' which is worrying us, has continued, 
although on a smaller scale. We have lost not only prominent, 
established scientists, but also talented young people: In the 
past two years approximately 500 associates of the academy have 
gone abroad for permanent residence, and more than 1,700 
associates are on extended missions. 
  I think you will agree that our international relations have 
become more striking and diverse. Cooperation within the 
framework of long-term agreements with our foreign partners, 
membership in international organizations, as well as 
participation in international scientific projects remain the 
basic forms of our relations. Today there are 74 agreements, 
which encompass nearly all the directions of contemporary basic 
science, with scientific organizations of the far and 
intermediate abroad. 
  We have membership in 235 organizations. However, it is 
alarming that the Russian Academy of Sciences is beginning to 
lose its positions in these organizations, although five Russian 
scientists have been elected presidents, 50 have been elected 
vice presidents, and about 80 have been elected members of the 
governing bodies. In the past two years funds have been allotted 
to us to pay the dues in international organizations. The 
Russian Academy of Sciences represents not only its own 
interests, but also the interests of the state. However, the 
funds being allotted are insufficient, and due to this we are 
beginning to lose positions in international scientific 
organizations. 
  It is gratifying that the scientific ties of the RAS with 
the 
academies of sciences of the former republics of the USSR have 
begun to be restored. I believe that these academies are parts 
of the common organism of our scientific community, which are 
united by scientific schools, unique tools and sets of 
scientific research, and organizational principles. Integration 
is now being carried out both within the framework of bilateral 
agreements and through the International Association of 
Academies of Sciences. 
  I would like to say a few words about cooperation with state 
structures. It is necessary to mention a number of important 
decisions that were made by state bodies on the initiative and 
at the insistence of the Academy of Sciences. There is the 
well-known edict of the president of 21 September 1993. It 
applies to all the scientific associates of Russia, who have the 
academic degree of candidate and doctor of sciences. This is a 
significant edict, unfortunately, its implementation is being 
dragged out. But the situation all the same is straightening 
out, and now they are beginning to allocate money for these 
purposes. 
  I would like to note the very important April decree of the 
Supreme Soviet of 1993. According to it all the land, which the 
academy had at its disposal, is passing to its permanent, 
gratuitous, free use. And, of course, the Supreme Soviet helped 
us, having adopted the decision which prohibits the 
privatization of the scientific facilities of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences with the permission of the presidium of the 
Academy of Sciences. But I have to say that the State Committee 
for the Management of State Property is continuing to violate 
this law. 
  The protocol with the Ministry of Finance on the budget for 
1994. This, I believe, is an important agreement. In my opinion, 
it was proposed to allocate about R5 trillion for science, then 
this figure was lowered to R4.18 trillion, then Boris 
Georiyevich Saltykov fought with the Ministry of Finance and 
raised this figure to R4.4 trillion. The budget of the academy 
remains the same, they did not touch it, it was not cut in 
comparison with the budgets of other departments. And, of 
course, I cannot but speak here about the important statement in 
support of science, which the State Duma has now adopted. 
  To preserve and develop our basic science is only a part, 
though the main one, but only a part of the duty of the academy 
to Russia. And reality is such that we will not get the support 
of society, if we keep aloof of its concerns and shut ourselves 
up in our own problems. The academy is obliged to make its 
contribution to overcoming the crisis of Russia, a more 
substantial contribution than so far. 
  There is a historical law: Since the times of Archimedes, if 
not earlier, scientists came to the aid of their society, during 
wars and during dislocations and economic and political 
upheavals. 
  We have considerable resources to help the country. In the 
area of the natural and exact sciences the academy has basic 
developments with enormous potential introduction. Given the 
proper organization of the matter and the support of the 
authorities many of them could be used in the immediate future. 
The legislation that now exists, unfortunately, is impeding the 
development of this work. 
  In the area of the social sciences our scientists should 
make 
their contribution to the understanding of what is now happening 
in the country, from where the decay of civil ethics, outbursts 
of mass violence and blood-letting ethnic clashes originated, 
whether there are real means of their prediction and prevention 
or has the decline of civilization as we know it begun. 
  The academy should give help to the state, participating in 
the work of specific commissions and committees and in the 
drafting of specific programs and documents, which require 
professional scientific knowledge. In particular, it is 
necessary in the immediate future to develop the legal basis of 
state science and technology policy and the status of the 
scientific organization and the scientific associate. To insert 
proposals in the draft of the new civil and customs codes and in 
tax and credit legislation and to specify the competences of 
federal and state bodies of management. 
  Russia needs a Federal Program of the Development of Science 
for the Next 10 Years. The academy of sciences should take an 
active part in the formulation of this program, particularly in 
the area that concerns basic research. State guidelines in the 
area of science should thereby be formulated. 
  The academy should coordinate basic research in the country 
to a greater extent. From this standpoint the role of the 
scientific councils attached to the presidium and the 
departments should be increased substantially. 
  The academy is obliged to use its prestige for the support 
of 
prominent centers of sectorial science, many of which are in a 
more difficult position than the academy. 
  We should participate most actively in the immediate 
completion and in the carrying through legislative bodies of a 
package of laws that are connected with the existence and 
activity of our science cities. Much is being said on this 
theme, but no headway is being made. 
  The thorough integration of the academy with leading 
universities of Russia is necessary. 
  Keeping in mind the recertification of institutes, it is 
necessary first of all to assess what contribution the institute 
has made, say, in the last five years to basic science. Of 
course, recertification is also needed for the improvement of 
the scientific structure of the academy. There are proposals to 
consider the question of the possibility of changing the 
academic status (from the standpoint of base financing) of the 
subdivisions, in which basic science is poorly developed and the 
nature of the activity of which--at times extremely important 
activity--does not correspond to the basic tasks of the academy. 
We should also think about uniting in the interests of the cause 
several of our subdivisions. 
  A number of proposals concern the possibility of decreasing 
the number of scientific departments of the RAS and uniting 
several of them. This question is a very ticklish one and cannot 
be settled imperatively, inasmuch as such radical changes can 
worsen the contact with institutes, while the material gain from 
such unification is small. Not rejecting the very posing of the 
question, I think that it should be studied carefully by the 
presidium. 
  The procedure of distributing base financing should promote 
the elimination of inefficiently operating subdivisions and of 
associates, who do not carry a significant and necessary load, 
and the reorientation of individual collectives and associates 
in the priority directions. It is not a question of mass 
reductions at the academy. The presidium if opposed to such a 
statement of the question. 
  We should receive very substantial assets for science, if we 
are to use correctly our property and basic developments that 
are ready for pilot introduction. For this it is necessary to 
raise the professionalism in the use of these sources and to 
create an atmosphere of openness and mutual trust and serious 
control.

<F P=106> [Excerpts from speech by Chief Scientific Secretary of the </F>
Russian Academy of Sciences Igor Makarov at the March 1994 
General Meeting of the Russian Academy of Sciences, under the 
rubric ``Science: The Hour of Choice. Guided by a Wise Budget'': 
``Both To Abound and To Suffer Need''] 
  [Text] After describing the overall situation of the state 
of affairs at the Russian Academy of Sciences and making a brief 
survey of the scientific results of the year, I. Makarov dwelt 
on the work of the presidium of the RAS. 
  During the year under review the presidium heard 16 
departments. In the end many positive results were obtained. 
First of all the departments made an analysis and outlined means 
of improving their activity. Priority directions of scientific 
research were formed, redundant or obsolete subdivisions of 
scientific institutions were eliminated, and the subdivisions, 
which conduct mainly applied research, were converted to cost 
accounting. The process of getting rid of unnecessary personnel 
and themes, which is natural under these conditions, is taking 
place. The institutions, which have been linked into the 
``technological chain,'' are seeking new forms of organizational 
interaction, for example, in the form of joint institutes, as 
the Institute of High Temperatures of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences and the Institute of Earth Physics, the Institute of 
Chemical Physics and others have done. 
  And nevertheless the problem of structural changes at the 
academy is still far from its solution. 
  In examining the discussions of the work of the departments 
in aggregate, it is also possible to note several oversights. In 
my opinion, financial and economic analysis did not take its 
proper place in their work. The questions of the specification 
of the content of the academy charter from the standpoint of the 
interests of the departments and of its coincidence with the new 
conditions and the problems of social relations in scientific 
collectives were practically not touched upon. 
  In accordance with the instructions of the general meeting 
the presidium of the RAS devoted daily attention to the search 
for additional sources of financing. During the year under 
review they invested many billions of rubles in scientific 
research of the RAS. 
  In connection with the development of the independence of 
the 
regions it seems to me that the expansion of research in their 
interests has considerable prospects. Practical confirmation of 
this is the ``Science for Moscow'' and ``Moscow for Science'' 
programs. They made it possible to obtain additionally from the 
city budget approximately R1.5 billion. Moreover, Moscow granted 
the institutes breaks on the fees for electric power, heat, 
water, and sewer service and on the rent for premises. The city 
obtained from the academy the science-intensive technologies it 
needed. 
  Of course, by earning additional assets, we, on the one 
hand, 
are contributing to the preservation of the creative potential 
of the academy. However, this process is distorting the 
structure of our potential. A larger and larger portion of it is 
switching to exclusively applied spheres or to enterprise. A 
question arises: What factors are now decisive in determining 
the real priorities in the basic directions of research at the 
RAS: The notions of the scientific community about priorities or 
the financial receipts from extrabudgetary sources? And there is 
more. Should the system of priorities in effect in our country 
of the distribution of state budgetary assets by directions of 
research take into account the receipts from extrabudgetary 
sources? 
  It seems to me that we should find the answers to these and 
similar questions in the process of joint discussions before we 
are faced with the fact of the disappearance of basic research 
at the academy. 
  The patent law protection of our scientific product is 
playing an important role. Owing to patent protection (and until 
1990 the academy maintained abroad from 800 to 1,000 patents) we 
obtained every year appreciable amounts of hard currency. For 
example, $130,000 were spent on the patenting of three 
inventions relating to fianites (a development of the Physics 
Institute imeni Lebedev), while the payments from foreign firms 
under agreements came to $12 million. 
  The change starting in 1991 of the procedure of paying 
expenses, which are connected with the patenting of inventions, 
and the lack of a centralized monetary fund of the academy led 
to the significant decrease of the amounts of foreign patenting 
at the RAS. 
  During the year under review the institutions of the RAS 
received just 26 foreign patents, while the revenue from the 
sale of licenses came to only U.S. $36,000. 
  Fundamental changes in the patent and licensing policy of 
scientific institutions and the RAS as a whole are necessary for 
the conversion of scientific and technical achievements into a 
commodity, including an export commodity, and the formation of a 
stable source of currency receipts, and we are working on this. 
  In spite of the difficulties with financing, such a form of 
the obtaining of knowledge and the exchange of experience as 
scientific conferences, meetings, symposiums and schools is 
being restored in the life of our scientists. During the year 
under review more than 100 such measures were implemented. This 
year the institutes and scientific councils have planned to 
implement 200 measures. I will recall that until the sharp 
decrease of their number in 1992 more than 400 meetings, 
conferences and schools were held annually. 
  I cannot but speak about the RAS-UNESCO contract ``The Basic 
Sciences in Russia,'' the implementation of which was rated 
highly by the leadership of UNESCO. During its fulfillment the 
conducting of scientific research of an international scale, the 
giving of assistance in the establishment of the Scientific 
Center of Computer-Integrated Systems of the RAS, the practical 
study of talented young scientists at leading world centers, and 
much else became possible. 
  In concluding the discussion of the results of the work in 
1993 and stating the fulfillment of many items of the decrees of 
the general meeting, it is impossible not to note that a number 
of important decisions remain unfulfilled. 
  It has not been possible to complete the formulation of the 
concept of the activity of the academy under the new conditions. 
Thus far a system of the examination of the activity of academic 
scientific institutions has not been established. A fund for the 
support of young scientists has not been formed at the RAS. 
  I would not want to exaggerate the importance of the concept 
of the RAS under the new conditions, but it would be unjust to 
understate it. The existence of a concept always testifies to an 
intelligent approach to one's own activity, which, as you know, 
never hurts. 
  We have the charter of the RAS. But let us see whether it is 
that form of representation or not. Does our charter give, even 
if at the fundamental level, answers to questions that arise in 
life: What forms of work with the property of the RAS are 
permissible for us, and what ones are not; what objects of this 
property can be privatized and how in the process of 
privatization should the interests of the academy be reflected; 
what forms of entrepreneurial activity are permissible in our 
community; under what conditions can a person hold an 
administrative position at the academy and be an associate of 
it, and under what ones can he not; should the assets that are 
earned by institutions, which receive state budget financing and 
use the fixed capital and creative potential of the academy, be 
redistributed in the academy and thus support priority 
directions of scientific research; finally, one should also 
think about the moral and ethical principles in the life of our 
community. 
  In the charter there are neither answers to nor principles 
of 
answering such questions. They are also not present in other 
standard documents. 
  About the fund of young scientists. It seems to me that such 
a fund is more than necessary. If our talented young people 
instead of thoughts about basic problems rush about in search of 
means of survival, they will find means in the end, but what a 
price for science! 
  Given the decrease of the amounts of state budget financing 
of the RAS I think that now a single solution is possible--to 
establish the fund of young scientists by means of deductions of 
the institutes and commercial structures attached to the 
academy. I ask you to express your opinion on the listed sources 
of financing of the fund. The position of the directors of our 
institutes is especially important here. 
  Winding up, I will dwell briefly on questions of the 
interaction of the academy with the leadership of the state. Our 
scientists took a direct part in the work of many governmental 
commissions and committees of the former Supreme Soviet, now the 
State Duma, and made a substantial contribution to the solution 
of domestic and international problems. 
  Examining from an unbiased standpoint the life of the 
academic community, it is impossible not to note that this life 
was painted with the entire rainbow of colors. And the people, 
who are trying to depict it only in black or only in rose color, 
are hardly correct. 
  It appears that the ancient biblical wisdom, which was 
formulated in the epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the 
Philippians, is becoming a guiding one for us: ``I know both how 
to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all 
things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to 
abound and to suffer need.'' 
  The main thing was done. Given the support of the RAS on the 
part of the leadership of the state, the government of Moscow 
and the international scientific community we were able during 
the year under review to preserve the creative potential of the 
academy and to achieve good scientific results.

<F P=106> [Article under the rubric ``Such Matters'': ``Arguments and </F>
Figures''] 
txt}[Text] In the last issue we reported that the subcommittee 
for science of the Committee for Education, Culture and Science 
of the State Duma had rejected the draft of the budget, which 
was submitted by the government, in the area that concerns the 
allocations for science. It was proposed to return it to the 
government for fundamental revision. What prompted the 
subcommittee (one of the concerns of which, incidentally, is the 
adjustment of the budget for the purpose of reducing state 
spending) to take such a resolute step? We offer for your 
attention the line of reasoning of the experts of the 
subcommittee, which was set forth in the conclusion on the draft 
of the law of the Russian Federation ``On the Federal Budget for 
1994'' with respect to the section ``Basic Research and the 
Promotion of Scientific and Technical Progress.'' 
  ``The amount of financing of basic and applied science, 
which 
is envisaged by the draft of the budget, is catastrophically 
inadequate. As compare with 1991, when the share of science came 
to 1.03 percent of the gross domestic product, the spending on 
scientific research in comparable prices has decreased to 
one-half. 
  The proposed draft of the budget preserves the deformed 
structure of expenditures on science, which has formed in recent 
years, when the share of assets for the remuneration of labor 
and social insurance came to more than 81 percent. The indicated 
structure completely ignores the sharp, thirty- to fiftyfold, 
increase of the prices for energy resources and the substantial 
increase of the cost of transportation and municipal services 
and the outlays on scientific equipment, materials, reagents, 
and scientific information. Thereby merely the maintenance, 
moreover, the extremely inadequate maintenance, of a portion of 
the scientific personnel is being achieved, without the 
possibility of conducting scientific research itself. 
  The sum of the proposed expenditures on science of 11.8 
trillion rubles [R], which appears in the aggregate balance, 
should not be misleading, since the extrabudgetary research and 
development fund, the deductions to which are not of a mandatory 
nature and, therefore, under the conditions of the economic 
crisis are unrealistic (in 1993 of the forecast R1.7 trillion of 
extrabudgetary assets of research and development only R41.6 
billion were actually received), makes up two-thirds of this 
amount. Thus, it is actually necessary to count only on the 
budgetary component--R4.5 trillion (0.6 percent of the gross 
domestic product). 
  In the submitted draft of the budget the remainder principle 
of the financing of the scientific sphere is firmly established, 
since it is financed from the development budget, the formation 
of which, in accordance with the law 'On the Budgetary System of 
the Russian Federation,' is carried out only in the absence of a 
budget deficit, but such a deficit is incorporated in the 
submitted draft. Thus, science does not have in practice 
guarantees of financing. 
  In the opinion of the subcommittee, the spending on civilian 
science, which is included directly in the federal budget for 
1994 in Article 15 of Section 4, should come not to R4.5 
trillion, but to not less than R7.7 trillion (1 percent of the 
gross domestic product and 4.2 percent of all budgetary 
spending, which is half the share of the gross domestic product 
that is allocated for science in developed countries and is 
acceptable only in case of substantial tax, tariff and customs 
benefits), of which not less than R2.8 trillion should be 
allotted for material expenditures, the purchase of scientific 
publications, the assurance of a modern level of information 
service of scientists, as well as the compensation of the energy 
outlays on the maintenance of scientific institutions and the 
covering of the energy costs of energy-intensive scientific 
project. Thus, the minimum expenditures on science will require 
the additional allocation of R3.2 trillion. 
  Even these funds will make it possible to meet the needs of 
only a portion of the scientific research, therefore, at the 
same time it is necessary to envisage an increase of the share 
of the direct financing of projects and programs and the 
addressed support of scientific schools and collectives and 
individual researchers. The share of budget assets (including 
the assets liable to distribution through funds), which ensure 
the implementation of a selective scientific and technical 
policy, should make up not less than 45 percent of the total 
spending on science. Here it will become possible to channel 
into the financing of basic science, which is national cultural 
property and creates the prerequisites for the economic revival 
of the country, about R2.5 trillion (0.35 percent of the gross 
domestic product, which corresponds to the pattern of spending 
for these purposes in developed countries). It should be 
emphasized that throughout the world the state assumes 
practically entirely the financing of basic science.'' 
  The conclusion about the necessity of allocating additional 
assets was supported by the participants in a conference held in 
the subcommittee, which representatives of the RAS, the Russian 
Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Russian Academy of 
Education, the Russian Academy of the Arts, the Russian Academy 
of Architecture and Construction Sciences, the Russian 
Engineering Academy, the Academy of Technological Sciences, the 
Academy of Natural Sciences, Moscow State University, the 
Council of Rectors of Moscow Higher Educational Institutions, 
the State Archival Service, the State Committee for Higher 
Education, and the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of 
Russia attended.

``Semi-Official'': ``The Ministry of Science and Technical 
Policy Has Won Another Battle''--first paragraph is NAUKA I 
BIZNES introduction; last paragraph is NAUKA I BIZNES conclusion] 
  [Text] In the middle of February, after a two-month delay, 
the government of Russia finally settled the issue of how the 
scientific research institutes of Russia will pay for 
electricity and heat. For some of them the bills often exceed 
substantially the total amount of the budgetary assets received 
by them. 
  As Boris Saltykov stated, the trouble is that in Russian 
legislation there is no concept of a ``nonprofit organization,'' 
which, in particular, would enable institutes to pay for power 
at preferential rates, and not on the same basis as production 
enterprises. This situation at the beginning of 1993 was still 
tolerable, but after electric power rates increased by fifteen- 
to sixteenfold, while the scientific budget of Russia increased 
by only fourfold, many power-consuming experimental plants began 
to shut down. 
  In spite of a sharp decrease in power consumption, the 
Kurchatov Institute has enormous debts, as a result of which at 
times the issuing of pay is delayed there for a long time. The 
Institute of Nuclear Physics in Obninsk cannot find 400 million 
rubles [R] for these purposes. The Institute of High Energy 
Physics in Protvino has been forced to limit the experimental 
sessions on its accelerator to only two to three weeks a 
quarter. As Viktor Ageyev, deputy director of this institute, 
reported, each such session costs researchers R1.5 billion. At 
the beginning of this year due to the delay with the allocation 
of budgetary assets to the institute scientists were forced to 
settle a somewhat paradoxical dilemma: to turn on the 
accelerator and remain without pay or to receive pay, having 
deprived themselves of the opportunity to do some work on the 
accelerator. The Dubna Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, 
which is connected with international obligations, is unable to 
shut down its facilities and, therefore, is accumulating 
enormous debts without the prospect to pay them. 
  Vladimir Kadyshevskiy, director of the Joint Institute for 
Nuclear Research, in December of last year got a meeting with 
then Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar and, in particular, asked him to 
help in this matter, in which he was supported by Minister of 
Science Boris Saltykov. Gaydar willingly volunteered to help and 
immediately gave his staff the corresponding orders. Contrary to 
the opinion of skeptics, who believed that this matter, as 
always, would get bogged down in bureaucratic red tape of the 
government, a tentative agreement with the Ministry of Fuel and 
Energy was reached rather quickly and on 26 December (a 
fantastically short time for our realities) should have been 
signed. The confidence in the success of the action was so great 
that Boris Saltykov publicly declared the decrease of rates for 
a number of institutes as a fete accompli. Since then the 
signing of the agreement has been postponed weekly for the most 
different reasons, which are most reminiscent of plausible 
excuses. 
  The Ministry of Fuel and Energy actively opposed the 
reduction of rates for scientific institutes. ``Apparently, we 
will be forced to agree to this,'' Vitaliy Bushuyev, deputy 
minister of fuel and energy, recently stated. True, he 
immediately added that his ministry regards such a way out of 
the situation ``anti-economic stimulation.'' This, Bushuyev 
believes, will lead to a new spiral of the increase of energy 
prices and will increase the burden, which is heavy as it is, on 
the shoulders of industrial enterprises. In his opinion, it 
would be far more correct not to demand a reduction of rates, 
but to save more stringently the energy that is being consumed 
today ``with terrible wastefulness.'' 
  The directors of 320 institutes, which had gotten on the 
list 
for the reduction of rates, awaited impatiently the end of the 
dragged out rate incident and, as Viktor Ageyev stated, linked 
with the success or failure of this action their subsequent 
attitude toward Boris Saltykov. The business reputation of the 
minister and, perhaps, his reputation were at stake, inasmuch as 
the support of the directors, which in January had played a 
substantial role in his conflict with the leadership of the RAS, 
will undoubtedly also be vitally important in the future. 
  The incident, however, is not over. In the government 
commission for operations, where the rate reduction was endorsed 
as a whole, it was decided to grant the right to pay half of the 
wholesale factory price to not more than 50 institutes. The 
remaining 270 institutes will have to seek other means. For 
example, to go with requests not to the government, but directly 
to officials of the electricity and fuel departments. As an 
executive of one such institute, who wished to remain anonymous, 
reported, this means is being used no less effectively than the 
first--Russian officials, as, probably, any others, are not like 
limitations of their rights from above, but are themselves 
inclined at times to do a favor for a poor debtor and exempt him 
from the payment of a debt.

<F P=106> [Article by Vlad Ignatov under the rubric ``A Model'': ``An </F>
Original View of National Property. Less That 1 Percent of the 
GRoss Domestic Product Is Being Allocated for Science''] 
  [Text] On Tuesday a joint meeting with the participation of 
Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice bloc, Nikolay 
Vorontsov, head of the Duma Committee for Education, Science, 
and Culture, and Russian Federation Minister of Science Boris 
Saltykov, which was devoted to the search for means of reforming 
the organization and financing of scientific research, was held 
at the Ogareva, 5 Center. 
  In the USSR the expenditures on design development and 
scientific research came to 6 percent of the gross domestic 
product (GDP) with 100 percent state financing. Now it will be 
impossible to maintain such a structure. And last year the real 
budget of science came to only 0.78 percent of the GDP with 100 
percent state financing. In the opinion of Nikolay Vorontsov, 
such a budget became a regional leader, but is absolutely 
unacceptable for a country with such a level of development as 
Russia. ``In any event Russia should preserve its basic science, 
which is national property and creates the prerequisites for the 
economic revival of the country,'' the duma committee chairman 
believes. 
  In such countries as the United States, the FRG, and Great 
Britain the spending on basic science comes to 2.5-3 percent of 
the GDP with relatively low state coverage--40-50 percent. The 
large countries of the third world, which aspire to leadership 
in their regions (Brazil, India), are allocating for science up 
to 1 percent of the GDP with a very high (up to 90 percent) 
level of state financing. While the Pacific Ocean model (the 
``dragons''--Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan) is characterized by 
high expenditures on science (on the order of 2.5 percent of the 
GDP) with low (20-30 percent) state participation. 
  The question is, What model should Russia follow? In the 
opinion of the conference participants, now, inasmuch as private 
business, which would be capable of financing the spending on 
applied research at the level of 2.5 percent of the GDP, does 
not yet exist in the country, Russia cannot venture to orient 
itself toward developed western countries. The necessary minimum 
spending on science is 15 trillion rubles (or 2 percent of the 
GDP). In accordance with the Summary Financial Balance for 1994 
only 11.8 trillion rubles have been allocated. It turns out that 
the per capita spending on science in the Russian Federation is 
significantly less than the average world spending and a factor 
of 10 less than in the leading industrial countries.

  [Abstract] A rise in the Rocky Mountain spotted fever 
morbidity prompted renewed interest in the etiological agents of 
endemic rickettsiosis which is often treated as a subgroup of 
tick-borne spotted fever (KPL). Six strains of Rickettsia 
sibirica isolated at various times from patients and 
D. nuttalli, D. silvarum, H. concinna ticks in 
Siberia and Far East by the restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA fingerprinting methods are examined, 
and the genotypes of the R. sibirica strains are 
characterized. All strains under study have an identical DNA 
restriction fragment distribution pattern when used with an 
endonuclease set and the same hybridization zones with the DNA 
probe. The findings attest to the absence of distinctions in the 
genome of six R. sibirica strains isolated from 
various sources in the native tick-borne rickettsiosis 
etiological agent foci in Siberia and the Far East. Isolation of 
similar strains during a prolonged period serves as an evidence 
of their constant circulation which is probably responsible for 
the observed stability of its epidemiologic manifestation in the 
central zone of its areal. The study shows that R. 
sibirica is closer to R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, 
and R. slovaka, and the differences among them are at 
a strain level. The study is partially financed by a grant from 
Russia's National Scientific Technical Program for Priority 
Genetics Trends. Figures 3; tables 2; references 18: 7 Russian,
